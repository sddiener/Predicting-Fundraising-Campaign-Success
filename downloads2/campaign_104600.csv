<p>Hi there! We're Divine Games, a small team of indie developers, and we're trying to create a user-friendly, easy-to-use, modern gamebook editor!</p>
</div>
<h3 class=""sectionedit5"">What's a gamebook?</h3>
<div class=""level3"">
<p>Gamebooks are a special kind of books in which the protagonist is none else than you.<br/> You impersonate a character and make choices for him, and each different choice may lead you to different results: will you succeed in defeating the main enemy or will you lead your character to an early death? When you discover the evil plans of a secret organization, will you fight them or join them? These are only some examples of the situations you can find yourself in while reading a gamebook.</p>
<p>As you can see in our video, you can also make good use of condition-based statistics and items, much like a real rpg game: you can use money as a stat, and there you have shops. You can then use experience, and there you have levels.</p>
<p>The possibilities are nearly limitless.</p>
</div>
<h3 class=""sectionedit6"">That sounds fun! How can I create one?</h3>
<div class=""level3"">
<p>The bad news is, all of the features you see in the video are written in code language, which is very difficult to learn and use if you have no experience in computer programming.</p>
<p>So, here's what we want to do: we want to make a user-friendly gamebook editor which will do all the technical work for you - stuff like navigating through pages, generating trace maps, and most importantly exporting your book as an html page (like the one you see in the video) which you can send to your friends to play with, or publish it anywhere on the internet.</p>
<p>Our goal is to give you a really intuitive tool with which they can create what they have in mind without effort, using simple yet effective commands.</p>
</div>
<h3 class=""sectionedit7"">Why is our Gamebook Maker better than other Gamebook Makers?</h3>
<div class=""level3"">
<p>We have browsed the internet far and wide, and we have found a few gamebook makers, but they are all either incomplete, very hard to use or extremely limited.</p>
<p>On the contrary, our tool will be very easy to use - we will also provide documentation and sample books as tutorials at the release - and will allow you to turn your creativity directly into an interactive html book, without any restriction caused by technical issues.</p>
<p>With your help, our program will set a milestone in the gamebook community.</p>
<p>Note: the program will be developed in .NET 4.0, therefore it will not work outside of the Windows environment. The HTML output, instead, will work on any HTML5-compliant browser, even on smartphones!</p>
</div>
<h3 class=""sectionedit8"">What will I get for helping you?</h3>
<div class=""level3"">
<p>We will start making the editor as soon as we reach our goal, and we will release it shortly after.</p>
<p>Here's what you can get by supporting us:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""level1"">
<div class=""li"">$1: <strong>Newsletter:</strong> Every dollar counts! We will send you a Thank You mail and keep you informed about development and release (you can choose not to receive any mail if you so wish).</div>
</li>
<li class=""level1"">
<div class=""li"">$3: <strong>Pre-Purchase:</strong> All of the above + a copy of the program (price will most likely raise after release).</div>
</li>
<li class=""level1"">
<div class=""li"">$10: <strong>Special Thanks:</strong> All of the above + your name will be included in the special thanks area of the program.</div>
</li>
<li class=""level1"">
<div class=""li"">$25: <strong>Collector's:</strong> All of the above + we will send you a copy of a very cool gamebook made by us.</div>
</li>
<li>$50: <strong>Divine Associate:</strong> All of the above + we will add a link to your website/blog inside our software, and you will get to test the release candidates during the end stage of development.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class=""sectionedit9"">Help us making this true!</h3>
<div class=""level3"">
<p>Please consider funding us if you like gamebooks: we guarantee that our tool will be very easy to use while offering the same freedom of choice of a pen-and-paper made book. The only limitation will be your creativity.</p>
</div>

<a name=""update1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Update #1</h2>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>We have received so many questions, comments and suggestions in the last few days, we'd like to thank you all for your interest :)</p>
<p>Moving on to more important things, in this brief update we'll answer some of your questions and tell you more about our plans for the Gamebook Creator.</p>
<p><strong>1) Will our software allow exporting of pdf/rtf gamebooks?</strong><br/> Yes. We guarantee you will be able to export gamebooks in pdf and rtf formats, however they won't have all the features included in the HTML version, for obvious reasons. You can't possibly have a dynamic content RTF gamebook, although you can write a simple branching path book without using variables and conditions. We will explore our options for the PDF format.</p>
<p><strong>2) What are the other options to export and publish your gamebook?</strong><br/> You will be able to export your book in a single-file HTML format, just as the one you can see in our introduction video. This format will allow the writer to use dynamic content such as conditions and variables, which can be used to create advanced gameplay mechanics such as character attributes, inventory, shops, experience levels, dynamic battles and much more.</p>
<p>As for the accessibility of the HTML format, you will be able to read and use HTML books on most of the modern digital platforms: all of the operative systems, tablets and most smartphones. It will also be compatible with most of the screen reader softwares.</p>
<p><strong>3) Will writers be able to include pictures in their books?</strong><br/> Yes. Larger pictures will be resized to a thumbnail which you can click and view full size.</p>
<p><strong>4) Will our tool allow to print a tracemap of the book?</strong><br/> Yes, we will include an option to generate a PNG image showing a color-coded map of all paths and locations in your book.</p>
<p><strong>5) Will our software feature a random generator of events?</strong><br/> Yes. We will include a random number generator which you can use to skill-test or luck-test the reader. I will provide a couple examples:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""level1"">
<div class=""li"">You are trying to break through a wooden door: you will succeed if a sum of your strength attribute and a random value is greater than 15, otherwise you'll fail.</div>
</li>
<li class=""level1"">
<div class=""li"">You are looking for an elusive creature that you need to kill before you can advance in your adventure: each time you visit its lair, a random number is rolled and if it is greater than 10 you will find your creature in there.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6) Will you be able to create graphical adventures with our tool?</strong><br/> No, we are talking gamebooks and text adventures only. Graphics you can use are limited to pictures you provide.</p>
<p><strong>7) How do you write a book using our tool?</strong><br/> Most of the features required to write a gamebook or a text adventure will be performed through the use of three simple commands: [condition], [operation] and [jump].</p>
<ul>
<li class=""level1"">
<div class=""li"">The [condition] command will check if a a condition is true, i.e. if you own a certain item, if your strength is greater than a certain value, if you killed a certain enemy, if you have enough money, if you invited someone to your party and so on. If the condition is true, its associated text will be displayed, otherwise it won't.</div>
</li>
<li class=""level1"">
<div class=""li"">The [operation] command will be used to declare and edit variables, i.e. if the reader collects some money you must use an operation to increase its money value.</div>
</li>
<li class=""level1"">
<div class=""li"">The [jump] command will be used to create choices and branching paths.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These commands will be used in a bbcode-like fashion, which we find to be the easiest to understand and to use in a text editor. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""level1"">
<div class=""li"">[condition=Strength&gt;10]This text will be shown only if your strength is greater than 10[/condition]</div>
</li>
<li class=""level1"">
<div class=""li"">[operation]Money = +50[/operation]</div>
</li>
<li class=""level1"">
<div class=""li"">[jump=Page 3]Go to page 3[/jump]</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there will be many other utility commands for text-formatting, reader input and more.</p>
<p><strong>8) What makes our tool better than other tools already out there?</strong><br/> We aim at providing the simplest and and most complete tool ever made in the field of gamebooks and text adventures.</p>
<p>We have browsed through other existing softwares and I can say without a doubt that none of them offers BOTH the ease of use and all the features of our tool.</p>
<p>Usually gamebook editors are very limited, poorly structured and bad looking: more often than not they don't include a dynamic content system (no variables and conditions, no RNG), they force you to create tons of copypasted pages for each choice you want the reader to make, or they have a very bad internal navigation system, meaning that when you reach a considerable amount of pages, you won't have a clue where to go when looking for something.<br/> Our tool will not suffer from such problems as it will include dynamic content and an excellent internal navigation system with a tree-view of the book structure, the aforementioned tracemap and a jump-detect system that will show all jumps FROM and TO a certain page, creating buttons you can use to navigate directly through pages. Moreover, our program will include all the features of an advanced text editor such as automatic keyword highlighting, color coding, auto-complete and text folding.</p>
<p>On the other hand, text adventure editors are complete and not very limiting, but they are incredibly complicated to use. The large majority of those require some sort of programming knowledge, and the few ones which don't have 30+ pages of documentation describing features you will likely never use. A writer at his first book will feel overwhelmed and confused by the sheer amount (and uselessness) of options these softwares provide, and readers will probably miss the opportunity of having a new good book or adventure to play.<br/> Our tool will not require any kind of programming knowledge and writers will be able to understand how it works intuitively and immediately, although we will provide a detailed documentation anyways.</p>

Update #4: Click here to see!
Hi there! We're Divine Games, a small team of indie developers, and we're trying to create a user-friendly, easy-to-use, modern gamebook editor!

What's a gamebook?

Gamebooks are a special kind of books in which the protagonist is none else than you. You impersonate a character and make choices for him, and each different choice may lead you to different results: will you succeed in defeating the main enemy or will you lead your character to an early death? When you discover the evil plans of a secret organization, will you fight them or join them? These are only some examples of the situations you can find yourself in while reading a gamebook.
As you can see in our video, you can also make good use of condition-based statistics and items, much like a real rpg game: you can use money as a stat, and there you have shops. You can then use experience, and there you have levels.
The possibilities are nearly limitless.

That sounds fun! How can I create one?

The bad news is, all of the features you see in the video are written in code language, which is very difficult to learn and use if you have no experience in computer programming.
So, here's what we want to do: we want to make a user-friendly gamebook editor which will do all the technical work for you - stuff like navigating through pages, generating trace maps, and most importantly exporting your book as an html page (like the one you see in the video) which you can send to your friends to play with, or publish it anywhere on the internet.
Our goal is to give you a really intuitive tool with which they can create what they have in mind without effort, using simple yet effective commands.

Why is our Gamebook Maker better than other Gamebook Makers?

We have browsed the internet far and wide, and we have found a few gamebook makers, but they are all either incomplete, very hard to use or extremely limited.
On the contrary, our tool will be very easy to use - we will also provide documentation and sample books as tutorials at the release - and will allow you to turn your creativity directly into an interactive html book, without any restriction caused by technical issues.
With your help, our program will set a milestone in the gamebook community.
Note: the program will be developed in .NET 4.0, therefore it will not work outside of the Windows environment. The HTML output, instead, will work on any HTML5-compliant browser, even on smartphones!

What will I get for helping you?

We will start making the editor as soon as we reach our goal, and we will release it shortly after.
Here's what you can get by supporting us:


$1: Newsletter: Every dollar counts! We will send you a Thank You mail and keep you informed about development and release (you can choose not to receive any mail if you so wish).


$3: Pre-Purchase: All of the above + a copy of the program (price will most likely raise after release).


$10: Special Thanks: All of the above + your name will be included in the special thanks area of the program.


$25: Collector's: All of the above + we will send you a copy of a very cool gamebook made by us.

$50: Divine Associate: All of the above + we will add a link to your website/blog inside our software, and you will get to test the release candidates during the end stage of development.


Help us making this true!

Please consider funding us if you like gamebooks: we guarantee that our tool will be very easy to use while offering the same freedom of choice of a pen-and-paper made book. The only limitation will be your creativity.

Update #1
Hello everyone!
We have received so many questions, comments and suggestions in the last few days, we'd like to thank you all for your interest :)
Moving on to more important things, in this brief update we'll answer some of your questions and tell you more about our plans for the Gamebook Creator.
1) Will our software allow exporting of pdf/rtf gamebooks? Yes. We guarantee you will be able to export gamebooks in pdf and rtf formats, however they won't have all the features included in the HTML version, for obvious reasons. You can't possibly have a dynamic content RTF gamebook, although you can write a simple branching path book without using variables and conditions. We will explore our options for the PDF format.
2) What are the other options to export and publish your gamebook? You will be able to export your book in a single-file HTML format, just as the one you can see in our introduction video. This format will allow the writer to use dynamic content such as conditions and variables, which can be used to create advanced gameplay mechanics such as character attributes, inventory, shops, experience levels, dynamic battles and much more.
As for the accessibility of the HTML format, you will be able to read and use HTML books on most of the modern digital platforms: all of the operative systems, tablets and most smartphones. It will also be compatible with most of the screen reader softwares.
3) Will writers be able to include pictures in their books? Yes. Larger pictures will be resized to a thumbnail which you can click and view full size.
4) Will our tool allow to print a tracemap of the book? Yes, we will include an option to generate a PNG image showing a color-coded map of all paths and locations in your book.
5) Will our software feature a random generator of events? Yes. We will include a random number generator which you can use to skill-test or luck-test the reader. I will provide a couple examples:


You are trying to break through a wooden door: you will succeed if a sum of your strength attribute and a random value is greater than 15, otherwise you'll fail.


You are looking for an elusive creature that you need to kill before you can advance in your adventure: each time you visit its lair, a random number is rolled and if it is greater than 10 you will find your creature in there.


6) Will you be able to create graphical adventures with our tool? No, we are talking gamebooks and text adventures only. Graphics you can use are limited to pictures you provide.
7) How do you write a book using our tool? Most of the features required to write a gamebook or a text adventure will be performed through the use of three simple commands: [condition], [operation] and [jump].


The [condition] command will check if a a condition is true, i.e. if you own a certain item, if your strength is greater than a certain value, if you killed a certain enemy, if you have enough money, if you invited someone to your party and so on. If the condition is true, its associated text will be displayed, otherwise it won't.


The [operation] command will be used to declare and edit variables, i.e. if the reader collects some money you must use an operation to increase its money value.


The [jump] command will be used to create choices and branching paths.


These commands will be used in a bbcode-like fashion, which we find to be the easiest to understand and to use in a text editor. Here are some examples:


[condition=Strength>10]This text will be shown only if your strength is greater than 10[/condition]


[operation]Money = +50[/operation]


[jump=Page 3]Go to page 3[/jump]


In addition, there will be many other utility commands for text-formatting, reader input and more.
8) What makes our tool better than other tools already out there? We aim at providing the simplest and and most complete tool ever made in the field of gamebooks and text adventures.
We have browsed through other existing softwares and I can say without a doubt that none of them offers BOTH the ease of use and all the features of our tool.
Usually gamebook editors are very limited, poorly structured and bad looking: more often than not they don't include a dynamic content system (no variables and conditions, no RNG), they force you to create tons of copypasted pages for each choice you want the reader to make, or they have a very bad internal navigation system, meaning that when you reach a considerable amount of pages, you won't have a clue where to go when looking for something. Our tool will not suffer from such problems as it will include dynamic content and an excellent internal navigation system with a tree-view of the book structure, the aforementioned tracemap and a jump-detect system that will show all jumps FROM and TO a certain page, creating buttons you can use to navigate directly through pages. Moreover, our program will include all the features of an advanced text editor such as automatic keyword highlighting, color coding, auto-complete and text folding.
On the other hand, text adventure editors are complete and not very limiting, but they are incredibly complicated to use. The large majority of those require some sort of programming knowledge, and the few ones which don't have 30+ pages of documentation describing features you will likely never use. A writer at his first book will feel overwhelmed and confused by the sheer amount (and uselessness) of options these softwares provide, and readers will probably miss the opportunity of having a new good book or adventure to play. Our tool will not require any kind of programming knowledge and writers will be able to understand how it works intuitively and immediately, although we will provide a detailed documentation anyways.
 

Update #2

Hello again folks,
we worked very hard last week in order to ready something for you to see, and we managed to build an alpha version with some of the basic commands which our software will have at the release. Please note that this is a very early stage of development, therefore you will not see all of the features which will be present in the final release. In the following pictures you will see examples and demonstrations of:


An early stage of the editor UI, including the tree structure;


The three main commands: condition, operation and jump;


Some basic text-formatting;


The random number generator;


HTML export.


On to the pictures:


This is the “root” folder, where you set the name and starting page of your book. When those features are ready, you will also be able to set the summary page (left page), stats points and stats themselves in this folder.


Root Folder




This is an example of a page and its HTML output.



Page → Page Output





These are the three main commands: [cond] stands for Condition, [op] stands for Operation and [jump] stands for… well, jump.



Main Commands → Main Commands Output





Some advanced features you can use with the three commands.



Main Commands Advanced → Main Commands Advanced Output





This is how the random number generator works.



Random Number Generator → Random Output 1 or Random Output 2





Some text formatting.



Text Formatting → Text Formatting Output





Folders can be useful to create an organized structure of your book, i.e. when you are in a large area and you want to name your pages after it, but you don't want to repeat that title every time, you can use a folder Prefix.


Folder: Book Folder



Example of Prefix usage: Book Structure → Book Structure Output





Finally, this is a page featuring all we have showed thus far. Your book pages will look something like this, perhaps with more formatting and longer text.



Sample Page → Sample Page Output 1 or Sample Page Output 2 and Sample Page Output 3





You will probably notice that output pages have a lot of empty lines corresponding to unverified conditions, resulting in a bad looking text. Don't worry about this. We have already planned a [trim] command to remove any unwanted space.

Update #3

Hello again.
With this update we proudly present you our updated website: http://www.divinegames.it ! There you will find FAQs and screenshots of Divine Gamebook Creator as well as some info about our team.
Last week we managed to produce an early version of the book you see in our presentation video, this time using only our tool. In the following pictures you will see examples of:


The Summary (Left) Page;


Input System;


Stats System;


Advanced jumps using from().


On to the pictures:


This is how you add stats to the book using the root folder.


Adding Stats




This is the summary page.



Summary Page → Summary Page Output





This is an example of how a reader can input its player name.



Name Input → Name Input Result





Here you can see how you allow readers to input their stats. Notice the [statsleft] command, which manages stats points to distribute.



Distributing Stats Points → Distributing Stats Points Output





In this (apparently) complex page you see how the program acquires stats points through the get() function, and how you can use advanced jumps.



Character Creation 1 and Character Creation 2 → Character Creation Output 1, Character Creation Output 2, Character Creation Output 3, Character Creation Output 4





Here you can see an example of a real book page and initialization of many of the summary page variables.



Real Book Page 1 → Real Book Page 1 Output





Another example of a real page: here you chose to take the money from page 1, therefore the summary page has updated your possessions.



Real Book Page 2 → Real Book Page 2 Output




Update #4
Hello folks, this is our fourth and last update. You may have not heard much from us recently, but we have been working on the project and we are finally approaching the polishing stage. Release candidates will be sent out soon to anyone who is entitled to see them.
Due to the shortage of funds we couldn't improve very much on graphics and language support, however the basic code structure is very solid and we've tested lots and lots of features such as tracemaps, RTF/PDF exporting and visually impaired support.
We hope you will enjoy our product!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Originally
conceptualized in 2008, Gamers United is an organization bringing the video
gaming community and industry together, showcasing the positive aspects of
video gaming to the world. Each year we help organizations, such as children's
hospitals, in need of support. Gamers United is dedicated to giving back and
highlighting the video gamers’ youthful and giving spirit. 
 
The Impact
Do you remember what it feels like to be sick? Do you
remember a time where your had a fever so high you felt as if you were on fire
or felt so weak that even just lying in bed made you uncomfortable? This is
nothing compared to what some of the children in hospitals are feeling and
experiencing every day of their young lives. 
 
This is your chance to make that experience a little bit
easier by providing entertainment that can help act as a temporary escape from
reality as well as be used for rehabilitation and exercise for
recovery.   
 
We need your to help make this dream a reality but
regardless of the outcome of this campaign, we are committed to our cause and
will continue to make a positive impact on children and their families through
video gaming. 
 
What We Need & What You Get
By taking part in this
campaign, you are helping us help children throughout Southern
California.  Your contributions will help us purchase new hardware,
software, and additional gaming equipment for hospitals, as well as reach out
to new beneficiaries who may not have gaming options available for
patients.  While some games are designed to entertain and escape reality,
we also focus on games that can educate, stimulate, and allow for physical
development. Our goal is to reach out and connect with as many hospitals as we
can and establish gaming centers within these facilities so children will have
a place to escape to outside the confines of their hospital rooms.
Additionally, we are aiming to reach beyond Southern California in the upcoming
months.
 
This is a unique campaign
because of the varied number of perks available.  Some of the perks exclusive to this campaign include artwork
from Andie Tong and Kevin Mellon, in-game art from Game Mechanics, a personalized voicemail recording from True
Blood star Janina Gavankar, as well as prize packs from Nyko, Konami, Disney, Sony Online Entertainment and more. 
 
On behalf of Gamers United and our beneficiaries, thank you
for your support on this campaign.

With everyone's help Mobility-Gaming can attend ESWC Paris 2014 and get a shot at being an International Team! We have been trying for 7+ years to reach this goal and Get into a Major World Event and we can finally do it with all of your help! and support. 
All we ask is that if you cannot Donate even $5 to at least Share our Link and Spread the word! It only will take a minute and its only going to take 1000 People giving us $10 to make this dream come true! 
If someone can get $60,000 for Potato salad than this should be a walk in the park please make our e-sports dreams come true and send us to Paris Games Week!


Sponsors in E-Sports
Sponsors are few and far between and there are thousands of gaming teams around the world, and they cant all have sponsors. The problem with e-sports today is the best 24-32 teams in the world are the same teams that have been the best 24-32 teams in the world since when E-Sports began because they have the sponsors and the funding to go to every single event, it is almost impossible to get a sponsorship at the same level these teams already have.  Please help Mobility-Gaming break into the International scene and become a top world team to contend with the top Organizations today! 


  Risks & Challenges 
The Risks are that we could still come in last place in Paris but it would be a Great Gain for Mobility-Gaming CS:GO and the Organization.
Competing on an international Level is something Mobility-Gaming has been striving for since 2007 with a large Online presence we want to take Mobility International! to LANs across EU and NA 
Please help our team reach our E-Sports goals by helping us get to ESWC Paris! during the Games Week in October/November  2014
All rewards will be fulfilled after we return from Paris and production has been completed, we will have people that ordered custom t-shirts fill out their name/gamer tags on time when the info is requested and everything should be completed by January 2015
Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand that not everyone can afford to donate or has the ability to donate. What would help us is if you shared our Indiegogo campaigns with everyone you know, and ask them to share it with everyone that they know. Word of mouth travels far on the internet with the power of 10 Please help us help you help us get to ESWC Paris 2014! and make our E-Sports Dream a reality.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Recuerdo en mi niñez los cyber como un punto de reunión de todos aquellos ""frikis"" de la época y lo recuerdo con cierto cariño y ternura.</p>
<p>Lo que propongo es una evolución muy grande de ese concepto: un local donde la gente que le gusten los videojuegos, manga, anime, películas, etc se puedan reunir y disfrutar entre ellos no sólo de su compañía, sino también de los servicios que el bar ofrece como eventos, torneos, directos...

<p>We are a small team of dedicated game developers
working on casual mobile games. We live in the Czech Republic (yeah, that small
country in the middle of Europe) and we have always dreamed of making games and now finally after months of hard work we can show you guys fruition of our work. </p>
<p>Since
our young age we have been interested in computers and game development and all of
us have some past experience with game development but T-Pong will be our first
big project and we need that little boost from you guys to get it started. </p>
<p>For
our game we decided that best possible choice we have is campaign at indiegogo.
As a new indie studio we most certainly didn’t want to be tied to a publisher. The
main reason is because we care about our games and we really want to put our
heart and soul in our work. And that’s a lot harder when you have a publisher.
So we decided to tell you guys about our work and let the customers, gamers and
people who want to support our project decide if T-Pong is worth your hard
earned cash.</p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">For those of you who don’t
know what is original Pong. It’s very old and it is one of the earliest arcade video games. It’s a tennis sports game
featuring </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">simple </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">2D graphics</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">2 players battle each out in small playing field using bats. Score is calculated by a hit in enemy goal. Player with most points wins the match.</span></p>

<p></p></span><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">For our first game we decided to go with old-school classic Pong. It’s
quite sad that no one tried to adopt this game to new mobile technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">There
is so much more new stuff that can be added, it’s incredible. In our opinion
PONG is a great game concept but it can be improved by quite a bit. And we want
to bring those improvements to you. </span>Possibilities<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> are </span>endless and with support from you we can bring some of these to you.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As a kids we loved classic PONG so it just seems right to recreate it and make it even more awesome then before. And lets face it. Who doesn't like pong? We sure do.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/171196/files/20131102124411-what_is_tpong.png?1383421451"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">It’s an old school legend wrapped in a new style. Using cartoonish
graphics together with awesome new way of playing pong makes this game so much
more fun. </p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We have many different improvements – small and big. Game will
feature full blown customization and you will be able to see huge focus on
personalization of your game. This will be done by our so called “skins” and
other customization options – begging form simply coloring your name to
complete game overhauls. </p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/172793/files/20131103110710-SKINS.png?1383505630"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">But that’s not all! For sake of diversity we added 3
types of bats each witch their own advantages and disadvantages. For example,
big bat will be the slowest of all bats but on the other hand it will be ….well,
the biggest. This allows players to shape the game to their liking and not play
by the “rules”. If you don’t want to play with a big slow bat, no one is
forcing you, just select the other one. </p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/171246/files/20131102130338-BATS.png?1383422618"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">On top of all this we added in-game
skills. They are basically special abilities you can use to either help
yourself or to confuse your opponent. These will be divided into two categories
– defensive and offensive. You can activate defensive skills when you are in
trouble and need that extra help. Just slow your opponent ball or build
yourself a wall. On the other hand offensive skills will be used when you
really want to score that point. You can split a ball in two or even change
trajectory of the ball. At release the game will have 18 unique skills and for
each game you will be able to choose 3. This creates very immersive and dynamic
experience never seen in pong games before. </p>

The matches will be the same as classic 2 players versus multiplayer, but we will tweak the game mechanics to fit 4 players playing in single match and ensure best possible experience. Matches can be played either with friends or completely random people. You will be able to invite your buddy to a team and together crush anyone who dares to challenge you. Or play a friendly match with 4 other friends and have a great time playing the game together.  </span></p>

<p></p></span></span></div>","We are a small team of dedicated game developers
working on casual mobile games. We live in the Czech Republic (yeah, that small
country in the middle of Europe) and we have always dreamed of making games and now finally after months of hard work we can show you guys fruition of our work. 
Since
our young age we have been interested in computers and game development and all of
us have some past experience with game development but T-Pong will be our first
big project and we need that little boost from you guys to get it started. 
For
our game we decided that best possible choice we have is campaign at indiegogo.
As a new indie studio we most certainly didn’t want to be tied to a publisher. The
main reason is because we care about our games and we really want to put our
heart and soul in our work. And that’s a lot harder when you have a publisher.
So we decided to tell you guys about our work and let the customers, gamers and
people who want to support our project decide if T-Pong is worth your hard
earned cash.





For those of you who don’t
know what is original Pong. It’s very old and it is one of the earliest arcade video games. It’s a tennis sports game
featuring simple 2D graphics.
2 players battle each out in small playing field using bats. Score is calculated by a hit in enemy goal. Player with most points wins the match.








For our first game we decided to go with old-school classic Pong. It’s
quite sad that no one tried to adopt this game to new mobile technologies. 
There
is so much more new stuff that can be added, it’s incredible. In our opinion
PONG is a great game concept but it can be improved by quite a bit. And we want
to bring those improvements to you. Possibilities are endless and with support from you we can bring some of these to you.
As a kids we loved classic PONG so it just seems right to recreate it and make it even more awesome then before. And lets face it. Who doesn't like pong? We sure do.


It’s an old school legend wrapped in a new style. Using cartoonish
graphics together with awesome new way of playing pong makes this game so much
more fun. 
We have many different improvements – small and big. Game will
feature full blown customization and you will be able to see huge focus on
personalization of your game. This will be done by our so called “skins” and
other customization options – begging form simply coloring your name to
complete game overhauls. 





But that’s not all! For sake of diversity we added 3
types of bats each witch their own advantages and disadvantages. For example,
big bat will be the slowest of all bats but on the other hand it will be ….well,
the biggest. This allows players to shape the game to their liking and not play
by the “rules”. If you don’t want to play with a big slow bat, no one is
forcing you, just select the other one. 



On top of all this we added in-game
skills. They are basically special abilities you can use to either help
yourself or to confuse your opponent. These will be divided into two categories
– defensive and offensive. You can activate defensive skills when you are in
trouble and need that extra help. Just slow your opponent ball or build
yourself a wall. On the other hand offensive skills will be used when you
really want to score that point. You can split a ball in two or even change
trajectory of the ball. At release the game will have 18 unique skills and for
each game you will be able to choose 3. This creates very immersive and dynamic
experience never seen in pong games before. 










Our ultimate goal – Multiplayer. This will be our main feature. You will
be able to play T-PONG against anyone from the entire world. Matches will be
divided in 2 types. Co-op multiplayer (more on that later) and versus with
includes 2 players matches and progression in ranking ladder. 
You can play
multiplayer either with your friends or complete strangers. And each match will
be recorded in your statistics. You will be able to view statistics in your
profile page. Those will feature many things, like win/lose ratio or usage of
each of your abilities. You will even be able to see what your favorite bat is. 




CO-OP

If we reach 100% we will add co-op matches. These matches will have up to 4 players divided into teams of two. The matches will be the same as classic 2 players versus multiplayer, but we will tweak the game mechanics to fit 4 players playing in single match and ensure best possible experience. Matches can be played either with friends or completely random people. You will be able to invite your buddy to a team and together crush anyone who dares to challenge you. Or play a friendly match with 4 other friends and have a great time playing the game together.  


EVENTS IN MULTIPLAYER MATCHES


From time to time we will launch special online events where players can battle for valuable rewards. For example we can do stuff like IOS vs ANDROID where entire platform will get a brand new exclusive skin. If they win off course.





To release a game. We need to pay developer license and fees to app
stores. Money to buy needed software. And also we need your help to monetize
our game. If we manage to reach 100% we will include co-op campaign.


STRETCH GOALS




You on the other hand you will get great rewards. We offer you huge amount of in game cosmetic bonuses like new exclusive looks or colored names. And that’s not all! We will give you guys proper recognition in credits or our T-pong webpage. And you will be able to get our exclusive T-PONG and TTWELVE T-Shirt. And for those of you who really want to participate and help us make this game awesome we prepared something special! You will name your achievements and skills! You can become our advisor in development! We also offer exclusive USB card with 8GB of memory, postcard send right to your home and even a TPONG themed mouse pad. There will also be our ""be a ball reward"" in with you can send your face to us and we will make it an in-game ball or you will be able to design your very own skin.

It is called Wheel of Death and is about a man who is standing ontop of a wheel. The wheel is above a pool of lava. When the game starts, the wheel begin to to turns slowly and speed up over time. In order to survive, the player would need to tilt the iPhone, making the man ontop of the wheel run (more tilt = faster run). Over time, the wheel wil begin to switch directions and do other things. If the player happens to fall into the lava, he will lose one of his three lives. The longer time the player can stay ontop of the wheel, the more points he or she will recieve. I guarantee you that it will be a fun game. I have contacted many developers, who said that it would be easy to design. However, the devoloper that offered the best price said thathe would need about 10.000 dollars. Once I get the money I will accept his offer and he will begin working on the app. We also need about 5,000 dollars for advertising purposes. I have been designing this app for five years now and have worked very hard on it. I will personally see to it that all the money raised goes towards the app. Thank You.

A number of you will also be invited to our launch event, location and timing is to be confirmed, but the free alcohol on offer is definitely confirmed!  Transport costs won't be provided for these perks though, so please consider this when making your pledge.We also have some perks that involve creating content and being actively involved in the development of the game.  This is a great chance to get a credit in a game that we're sure will be well received by the public and media alike. As we say, World Football 2014 is being developed by a group of games industry veterans.  Some of the team are employed with other development teams and are doing this project in their own time because of our collective desire to create a great football game. Because of this we haven't attached our names to this project.All members of our team development, production and design/community have been involved in some of the best loved football games of the last 20 years – with the exception of PES and Football Manager, two games we ALL love!  These games include but aren't limited to Sensible Soccer, Super Kick-Off, Actua Soccer, Premier Manager, Soccer ’97 and versions of FIFA.  We’re all passionate football fans, love gaming and are now working together on our own football game!!  Most of us have season tickets for the teams we have supported all of our lives.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Oasis game is no ordinary game. Its mission is to mobilise people to transform a space in their area into an Oasis, and in the process, create community from the bottom up.
Last year we played the game in Newham with Momentum and Lush and the impact of the game has had real lasting effects in building a resilient community.
Now, a group of 60 of us from around the world are going to play the game in Brazil  and in the process, learn to faciliate it ourselves and take it to new places. 
We each need to raise £1700 to make it happen. Which is where you come in. You give us a bob or two and we'll help make people's dreams come true! Literally.What We Need & What You Get




I'm raising £1700 for the Elos Institute who run the training programme. 
The money goes towards:
- Making a documentary- Food and Accomodation for trainees
- Stationary and materials to run the game
- Staff costs in liaising with the local community and selecting candidates
As a means of expressing my gratitude and spread the love I'll be sending out some gifts made by myself or sourced from local companies who share the values of this project - connecting people and building community.The Impact
Immediate impact:

Help us play the game - mobilising hundreds of people to create an Oasis in their area - this will be in one of the favelas around Santos, Brazil where it all started

Enable 60 young people from around the world to live as a community for a month and learn through experiencing the art of community-building

Long term impact:

Once I've learned it, I aim to take the game to new contexts to help catalyse resilient communities elsewhere

Enable 60 trainees to do the same, taking the game back to where they came from - among them India, Turkey, Bolivia, Zimbabwe and across Brazil


Long-term benefits for the local community - In Newham the game catalysed numerous positive initatives including the kids starting their own community choir and kick-started a long-term process of resilience-building in the community - find out more about the amazing things that have happened here: Ted X Newham

<p>Hello everyone, thanks for visiting our post :).  We are ShiftJoy, and we are the team behind Predator Realm. We're all teenagers (I'm 14, don't laugh, read on) but we have lots of experience in gaming, game design and technology and have help from our families for all the legal and money stuff :3</p>
<p>I'm Sol. Don't underestimate me just because I'm 14 :P. I started learning Unity (the game engine I am using) nearly 2 years ago and now I have enough experience to start creating my own game. I have always been into technology and gaming: I'm also a good web designer, and I've picked up several clients in my town to design websites for. </p>
<p>I worked hard designing websites and making small games in Unity for 8 months, until I had enough money to buy my very own Macbook Pro :D. It's certainly my most prized possession! Now I am using it to develop Predator Realm, with the help of my family and friends for some graphics design, legal stuff and sorting out the money.</p>
<p>The rest of us have a similar sort of experience as me, and we make a great, hard-working team!</p>
<p><b>We're not the only teenagers who have made games.</b> Robert Nay created 'Bubble Ball' when he was 14, and that became the top App Store game (beating Angry Birds) in 2011. Harry Moran created 'PizzaBot' when he was 12 which became the top Mac App Store game in 2011, too. (Yes, I've done my research!). I'm sure there are many more...</p>
<p>Well, enough about me, and us. Don't worry, we're not the sort of people who give up easily, and we're aiming to update our group website (<a href=""http://www.shiftjoy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.shiftjoy.com</a>) with videos and snaps from development once a week at least :D.</p>

<p>Predator Realm is an awesome third-person zombie shooter. It has more of a casual, arcade style compared to other FPS zombie games, but we are working on awesome graphics and different gamemodes to suit every PC gamer. </p>
<p>We're working on these game modes:</p>
<p><b>- Infinite Survival (Single Player)</b> - infinite waves of zombies, gets harder and harder, ends when you die</p>
<p><b>- Adventure (Single Player)</b> - progress through the levels</p>
<p><b>- Co-op Infinite Survival (2-4 Players)</b> - Same as Infinite Survival, but with your friends online</p>
<p><b>- Deathmatch (2-8 players)</b> - No zombies! Kill your rival players, the most kills wins!</p>
<p>(possibly a CTF gamemode too - thinking about it).</p>
<p>The main character is Zayn, a perfectly normal man, who is the only survivor of a mini-apocalypse in his hometown, up in the Heora Mountains. He must travel to the city and warn his fellow humans, and help them escape, before the whole area is taken over!</p>
<p>Currently Zayn has one weapon, an ACWR automatic rifle. It has a 26-round capacity and reloads in 1.5-2.5 seconds. We will, of course, be adding more weapons as the game progresses - one of the things we need the indiegogo money for is weapon design.</p>
<p>We're currently working on the Zombie AI and it is proving very successful. The zombie knows when to attack and will even attack other zombies if Zayn isn't close :P</p>

The channel is run by a friend who lives in London, Ontario, Canada. The videos are all based around video games but unlike many channels there is a large variety of games and different styles of videos. From gameplay to tutorials to highlight reels and fail videos.</p>
<p>What makes this channel important to me is the joy that it brings its creator. Even thought the channel has not seen a large amount of views the creator consistantly posts content and records games endlessly to get content. The goal is to get money that the creator can use to buy new equipment (microphones, monitors, better computers) as well as better software (for recording and editing), as well as bring notoriety to the channel. </p>
<p>Even if the goal is not reached hopefully the people who view the campaign page will atleast take the time to view 1 or 2 or perhaps even more of the videos on the channel and help him feel like his videos are bringing more people entertainment.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>The funding goal is set at $2000 the number is based on the cost of items that could improve the quality of videos. These items include: A studio microphone ($350), a second monitor ($200), upgraded computer parts ($500), new software for recording and editing ($200-$2000 varies based on quality)<br/>
</div>
<div>Our perks are more based on bringing people closer to the creator of the channel through personal interactions giving them a chance to play along side him in his games and be featured in videos on the channel that they are supporting (while remaining anonymous if preferred) </div>

The channel creator simply makes the videos because he loves doing it, so having people around the world show support for him will be beyond amazing for him. The monetary aspect will be significant because it will help him develop more videos and make perfect them more to his liking and give him the ability to continue to do something that he loves and give more people like myself a chance to enjoy the content he puts out.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>ZER0 LIMIT: Infinite Dreamer is the first game in the ZER0 LIMIT series.  In it, you are the dreamer. Your goals are straight forward: Run as fast as you can, jump as high as you can, and whatever you do, DON'T wake up.  Because when you wake up, the dream ends.<br/>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><img align=""right"" alt=""landscape small"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dreamer.throwawaygames.ca/images/landscape_small.png"" src="""" style=""""/>The game will take place in a fantasy landscape, where you're invited to explore upward as much as forward.  You, as the dreamer, will continue to accelerate until you do something which hinders it, like running into an obstacle, or particular items.  Regulate your speed to keep the game going.  Or don't, and see how long you can last.  Explore the skies as you use your speed to jump higher and higher, and see how long you can keep in the air without hitting the ground.  Just make sure to watch your landings.</div>
<div>
<br/><br/><br/>
</div>The idea for the game came to Adam based on how he dreams. You hear often about people flying in their dreams.  But Adam's never been able to do that.  In his dreams, he tends to JUMP.  Very high, and very far, and with vivid hang times and free falls.  Add that with the other nonsense that you find in dreams and you've got the recipe for an interesting game.<br/><br/>We want to start full development of the game by the end of January, and have planned to develop the game in 3 months, meaning it should be out for the beginning of May 2012.<br/>

<h3>Help us build an online, digital version of the well known Collectible Card Game!</h3>
<p><img alt=""Crystalicum Theme"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kuczborski.pl/crystalicum/CrystalicumFB.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Crystalicum Theme""/></p>
<p><em>Uwaga: Gra będzie dostępna również w języku polskim!</em></p>
<p><em>Nota: El juego también estará disponible en español cuando recoja $ 10,000!</em></p>
<p><em>Note: Le jeu sera également disponible en français quand vous rassemblez $ 20,000!</em></p>
<p><em>Hinweis: Das Spiel wird auch in Deutsch verfügbar, wenn Sie 30000 USD zu sammeln!</em></p>
<h3><strong>Welcome!</strong></h3>
<p>This is the crowdfunding campaign for <strong>Crystalicum</strong>, which is a MMO, CCG, RPG game. What does those acronyms stand for?</p>
<ul>
<li>MMO – Massive, Multiplayer, Online</li>
<li>CCG – Collectible Card Game</li>
<li>RPG – Role Playing Game</li>
</ul><p>At this point it might be good for you to take a look at the video, if you haven't done it already. It's a bit rough but shows a general concept of the game and its graphics. The gameplay is of course incomplete but it should give you a feel of the project.</p>
<p>On the visual side we wanted Crystalicum to be open to different graphic styles. That's why we gave illustrators cooperating with us a certain doze of freedom. The basic idea, however, is that illustrations' style refers mostly to the fable and fantasy style. That's why, in the game you can find illustrations inspired by Manga, European comics (i.e.  the ""L'Epée de Cristal"" series), the classic comic books and RPG.</p>
<p>Our goal is to combine beautiful game graphics with a concept of the collectible card game. The basic set of cards that we want to present will count about 200 cards - each with its own unique artwork.</p>
<p>With this collection you will be able to play the match wherever you are, on different platforms and even offline with your friends (printed edition will be available in selected regions). Game will also include extended RPG part with interesting plots and stories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Who develops this game?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kuczborski.pl/crystalicum/1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Who develops this game?""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This game is a joint effort of many people over at least several years. From the people who created the game in an offline version to the people who somehow continue this enormous amount of work and want to move this game to the digital version, expanding its potential significantly. The project is being developed by:<br/><br/><strong>Marcin Podsiadło</strong> - creator of many well-known game titles (RPG, board &amp; collectible card games) mostly for the Polish market (but not only), including games such as ""Crystalicum"", ""Saigo no Kane"" and ""7"". He is considered one of the pillars of the Polish RPG industry.<br/><br/><strong>Adam Kuczborski</strong> - participated in the creation of various business projects based on the Internet. He created marketing strategies for a number of themed social networks. He also has the experience in e-commerce and the development of trade fairs and events.</p>
<p>The team also includes at least a few other individuals not mentioned here. They are responsible for the programming, graphics, logistical or even spiritual support. Until now, our project was being created thanks to voluntary work of all these people, that is why it is impossible to list them all without forgetting even the slightest commitment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Why didn't we start a campaign sooner?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kuczborski.pl/crystalicum/2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Why didn't we start a campaign sooner?""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The answer is really simple - we weren't ready for it. Moving the game to its online version required analyzing project's basics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>transferring the existing rules of the board game into the online game engine (technical possibilities)</li>
<li>costs analyzing and preparation of the project’s budget</li>
<li>evaluation of potential investors (financial opportunities)</li>

</ul><p>It all took time, which I hope has allowed us to reach the point where the next step will be a breakthrough in the online collectible card gameplay.</p>

<p><img alt=""So what's the game about?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kuczborski.pl/crystalicum/3.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""So what's the game about?""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Welcome to the ""Crystalicum"". The Universe which fate you're going to take in your own hands. The universe you will become familiar with is different from worlds know from the books, movies or comic fantasy. It is not limited by the mountains or deserts - but by the interstellar void. Crystalicum is a universe of infinite number of worlds orbiting around the multicolored suns. Its inhabitants are the representatives of the great races, wander through the vastness of Space on board of the ships, powered by the sun energy and magical power of the Crystal. They are discovering more and more new worlds, extraordinary creatures and incomprehensible wonders.</p>
<p>Entering the game you are taking the fate of one of the great civilizations of the Known Universe in your hands. Only you can decide which one of them will dominate the ""Crystalicum"" World. Do you have the right skills to lead your civilization to the glory and fame? Will you do anything to lead it towards its rightful place among the stars? Are you ready to put your actions on the cards of the history or will you go down into the oblivion.</p>
<p>The basic set of cards that we want to present will count about 200 cards - each with its own unique artwork. They will be divided into four types, according to the rules of the game. In the basic version, we would like to present the characters, places, ships belonging to the four major civilizations of the Known Universe. These will be the Ice Elves, Crystal Empire, Dragon Dwarves and Astonia. This, of course, is just the beginning of an adventure in the Crystalicum universe. Every 3 months we plan to publish new expansion sets, in which you can find new patterns of cards (we plan to make 110 new designs). We are also planning special expansion presenting another well-known civilizations of the universe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""What about game mechanics?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kuczborski.pl/crystalicum/4.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""What about game mechanics?""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As mentioned above, Crystalicum is:</p>
<ul>
<li>MMO – Massive, Multiplayer, Online</li>
<li>CCG – Collectible Card Game</li>
<li>RPG – Role Playing Game</li>
</ul><p>What does it mean? It means we want to create a game for everyone - true fantasy fans and casual players both. You don't need to know tons of rules to play Crystalicum. You will be able to start a game quickly with your own starter deck of cards.</p>
<p>All cards will be collectible. It means that they will have their own value depending on their rarity, value in the game or even printed edition. There is a special mechanism in the game that will make it possible to exchange or trade the cards between the users, purchase of still available card decks or single copies of the cards.</p>
<p>In addition, we plan to implement to the game the advanced ability to affect your own character. According to the rules of RPG you will be able to develop yourself as well as to take part in various feature plots (yes, like every game based on a fable fantasy, it will have its own storyline, evolving in time).</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>
<ul>

<p><img alt=""Why Indiegogo?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kuczborski.pl/crystalicum/5.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Why Indiegogo?""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have been working on Crystalicum for the past several months and we're very proud of what we've accomplished so far. Unfortunately, our savings are running out and we have been forced to do other work that sometimes takes 100% of our time, leaving none of it to focus on developing the game. That's why if we don’t reach our goal ($18000) the production time will significantly extend.</p>
<p>We chose Indiegogo because it's a very open funding platform (contrary to others similar to it), we feel we can only innovate without barriers by remaining independent. Developing games is so special to us, it’s in some way a part of our lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><img alt=""Why are we asking for money?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kuczborski.pl/crystalicum/6.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Why are we asking for money?""/></div>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe we’ve found the team of experienced, enthusiastic developers and artists to pick up from the earlier version of game and we want to make Crystalicum something truly epic.</p>
<p>We could pay the people who have recently offered their help on the project and would be able to properly hire them what we can't do right now.</p>
<p>That’s why we hope to raise enough money to complete our game. Here is what we will use the money for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming: in order to build such an advanced project like ours we will need help of external developers at the beginning. In the comfort of our homes game engine programming would be unnecessarily time and resource consuming. And good programmers tend to value their work so much.</li>
<li>Hosting: Server hosting costs money, especially the servers with high bandwidth. Your money will help us to provide dedicated servers right for the massive multiplayer game.</li>
<li>Art: Although our wonderful graphic designers have already put a lot of work in this game, in order to fully devote themselves to this project, they also need to pay their own bills without the need to seek for alternative sources of funds needed to survive. So let's appreciate their contributions.</li>
<li>Music &amp; Sound Effects: Like every respected Role Playing Game, our game should also have its own individual climate (which we hope you heard in our pitch movie). And it's extremely hard to create it without the good sound quality and inspiring music. And also the good musician must eat sometimes.</li>
<li>Administrative costs: running a business plus legal and tax advice.</li>
<li>Marketing costs: if it's meant to be a Massie Multiplayer Game we need to achieve an appropriate recognition of it, even in the markets where our products have not been released yet. Thus, part of the funds will be dedicated to supporting You. Above all, thanks to you – the players - we have the best possible ways of advertising - recommending the product to others!</li>
<li>Our own Survival: Rent, food... and internet to keep us still working on the game.</li>
</ul><p>To finish our project and bring you a polished game, we will need about 6-12 months, working on it full time. That's why we need the funds necessary to keep us going. That brings us to the next question:</p>
<p><strong>How does this crowd funding work?</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">Easy. You pledge an amount of money you choose (see the sidebar to the right). The pledge will be withdrawn from your account immediately. When the collecting is complete, the funds are transferred to us. Then we are sending the awards to you and continue our work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""The goal."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kuczborski.pl/crystalicum/7.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The goal.""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the unlikely event happen that funding were to overshoot our goal, and we exceed the minimal goal (if we aren’t asleep right now and dreaming), we will be able to bring you more cool stuff. Underneath we show you the stretch goals we managed to achieve:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Translations: we already mentioned that if the goal is reached at the level of:</p>
<ul>
<li>$10000 - we will translate the game to Spanish language</li>
<li>$20000 - we will translate the game to French language</li>
<li>$30000 - we will translate the game to German language</li>
</ul><p><strong>2.</strong> If we reach our minimal goal ($18000) we will print the first edition of the game and it will be possible to buy it directly from us (or receive - look at the perks).</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> If we reach $30000 goal, we will be able to develop the game on every platform we would like to and start them at the same time. As mentioned above we want to give you the possibility of playing wherever you are and whenever you want!</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> If we reach $50000 we will be able to arrange a launch party in selected region and print at least two editions of the game.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> If we reach $70000 we will do all the above plus we will be able to create comic book, book or animated mini series about adventures in Crystalicum universe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""The Budget"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kuczborski.pl/crystalicum/8.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Budget""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re sure you’ve noticed the large amount of money we’re requesting to finish our game. Believe it or not, this sum could be higher, if we haven’t managed to use lots of arts and game concepts from the earlier developed games. We want to be honest so here’s the breakdown of how the money will be spent:</p>
<ul>
<li>66% - Game development</li>
<li>12% - Marketing costs</li>
<li>8% - Sallary</li>
<li>4% - Hosting services</li>
<li>4% - Accounting, tax &amp; legal advice</li>
<li>3% - Rent</li>
<li>3% - other administrative costs</li>
</ul><p>One final note: Indiegogo will deliver the cash as soon as we meet our first funding goal of $18000. So that means the sooner we reach that goal, the sooner we can get started on Crystalicum, the sooner we can show you progress, and the sooner we can release it. So if you intend to contribute, please do so at your earliest possible convenience!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We’re open to suggestions and ideas! And even though we have a pretty precise picture of what the game should look like (game mechanism have some limitations), we welcome helpful advices and honest opinions. Please write it here in comments or just e-mail us on <a href=""mailto:indiegogo@crystalicum.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">indiegogo@crystalicum.eu</a></p>

<p><img alt=""When will the game be done?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kuczborski.pl/crystalicum/10.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""When will the game be done?""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we achieved our first goal, to finish game we will need about 8-12 months, working on it full time.</p>
<p>First closed beta (for limited testers, also recruited among You – look for the right perks) should be ready after 3-5 months after finishing this campaign.</p>
<p>We will open the game for everyone but with not all of it's functions completed and still in beta version probably 6-8 month from now (to exclude as much errors and engine balance as possible).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Which platforms will be supported?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kuczborski.pl/crystalicum/11.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Which platforms will be supported?""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The game will be primarily a browser game. Available both on your own website as well as on selected social networks such as Facebook or other regional networks.</p>
<p>The game will also be available (in a less complex form) on mobile platforms such as iOS or Android.</p>
<p>All platforms will be using the same database – which means that wherever you play - <strong>you always have the access to your cards!</strong></p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>1. Risk of delay.</strong> There is always a possibility that the game will be delayed due to technical problems, unforeseen circumstances, also, like all creative projects, some mechanics may be changed if we consider them to be hurting the game - but don't worry, we will do everything so that you (and us) will get to play the game as soon as possible.<br/><br/><strong>2. Shipping international orders.</strong> Please add $5 for shipping within Poland, $25 for shipping within Europe and $35 for the rest of the world. I know, that's high, but shipping costs are insane. :( Shipping will be included starting with the $150 perk.<br/><br/><strong>3. How many languages does Crystalicum support?</strong> The confirmed languages are English and Polish - French, Spanish, German and other additional translations will be done according to available resources (as we mentioned at the begining of the page).<br/><br/><strong>4. When will I get my rewards?</strong> Some of the rewards will be delivered after the final release of the game, although some digital rewards or game rewards may be sent to you sooner.</p>
<p><strong>5. Upgrading pledges:</strong> Want to upgrade your contribute? No problem! Indiegogo doesn’t support it directly, so here’s how to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Make a new contribute in the amount equal to the difference between the perks.</li>
<li>2. Send us an e-mail at <a href=""mailto:indiegogo@crystalicum.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">indiegogo@crystalicum.eu</a> along with your username and describe the upgrade.</li>
<li>For example: You pledged $30 to get the Adventurer perk and want to get the Merchant, so you contribute an additional 20$ and drop us a mail. Easy!</li>
</ul><p><strong>6. Table game rewards:</strong> As we mentioned in perks decription, the ammount of reward games are limited. So if it is not written directly in the perk you will receive the game when:</p>
<ul>
<li>you're one of the first who contribute to the game</li>
<li>you declare that you want it (in perks where shipping cost must be added, we will contact you if you don't contact us)</li>

Help us build an online, digital version of the well known Collectible Card Game!

Uwaga: Gra będzie dostępna również w języku polskim!
Nota: El juego también estará disponible en español cuando recoja $ 10,000!
Note: Le jeu sera également disponible en français quand vous rassemblez $ 20,000!
Hinweis: Das Spiel wird auch in Deutsch verfügbar, wenn Sie 30000 USD zu sammeln!
Welcome!
This is the crowdfunding campaign for Crystalicum, which is a MMO, CCG, RPG game. What does those acronyms stand for?

MMO – Massive, Multiplayer, Online
CCG – Collectible Card Game
RPG – Role Playing Game
At this point it might be good for you to take a look at the video, if you haven't done it already. It's a bit rough but shows a general concept of the game and its graphics. The gameplay is of course incomplete but it should give you a feel of the project.
On the visual side we wanted Crystalicum to be open to different graphic styles. That's why we gave illustrators cooperating with us a certain doze of freedom. The basic idea, however, is that illustrations' style refers mostly to the fable and fantasy style. That's why, in the game you can find illustrations inspired by Manga, European comics (i.e.  the ""L'Epée de Cristal"" series), the classic comic books and RPG.
Our goal is to combine beautiful game graphics with a concept of the collectible card game. The basic set of cards that we want to present will count about 200 cards - each with its own unique artwork.
With this collection you will be able to play the match wherever you are, on different platforms and even offline with your friends (printed edition will be available in selected regions). Game will also include extended RPG part with interesting plots and stories.
 

 
This game is a joint effort of many people over at least several years. From the people who created the game in an offline version to the people who somehow continue this enormous amount of work and want to move this game to the digital version, expanding its potential significantly. The project is being developed by:Marcin Podsiadło - creator of many well-known game titles (RPG, board & collectible card games) mostly for the Polish market (but not only), including games such as ""Crystalicum"", ""Saigo no Kane"" and ""7"". He is considered one of the pillars of the Polish RPG industry.Adam Kuczborski - participated in the creation of various business projects based on the Internet. He created marketing strategies for a number of themed social networks. He also has the experience in e-commerce and the development of trade fairs and events.
The team also includes at least a few other individuals not mentioned here. They are responsible for the programming, graphics, logistical or even spiritual support. Until now, our project was being created thanks to voluntary work of all these people, that is why it is impossible to list them all without forgetting even the slightest commitment.
 

 
The answer is really simple - we weren't ready for it. Moving the game to its online version required analyzing project's basics such as:

transferring the existing rules of the board game into the online game engine (technical possibilities)
costs analyzing and preparation of the project’s budget
evaluation of potential investors (financial opportunities)
research in the market interest - which means YOU - potential players of our game.
It all took time, which I hope has allowed us to reach the point where the next step will be a breakthrough in the online collectible card gameplay.
And this is where we need your support! Without you it will be much harder to complete the game!
 

 
Welcome to the ""Crystalicum"". The Universe which fate you're going to take in your own hands. The universe you will become familiar with is different from worlds know from the books, movies or comic fantasy. It is not limited by the mountains or deserts - but by the interstellar void. Crystalicum is a universe of infinite number of worlds orbiting around the multicolored suns. Its inhabitants are the representatives of the great races, wander through the vastness of Space on board of the ships, powered by the sun energy and magical power of the Crystal. They are discovering more and more new worlds, extraordinary creatures and incomprehensible wonders.
Entering the game you are taking the fate of one of the great civilizations of the Known Universe in your hands. Only you can decide which one of them will dominate the ""Crystalicum"" World. Do you have the right skills to lead your civilization to the glory and fame? Will you do anything to lead it towards its rightful place among the stars? Are you ready to put your actions on the cards of the history or will you go down into the oblivion.
The basic set of cards that we want to present will count about 200 cards - each with its own unique artwork. They will be divided into four types, according to the rules of the game. In the basic version, we would like to present the characters, places, ships belonging to the four major civilizations of the Known Universe. These will be the Ice Elves, Crystal Empire, Dragon Dwarves and Astonia. This, of course, is just the beginning of an adventure in the Crystalicum universe. Every 3 months we plan to publish new expansion sets, in which you can find new patterns of cards (we plan to make 110 new designs). We are also planning special expansion presenting another well-known civilizations of the universe.
 

 
As mentioned above, Crystalicum is:

MMO – Massive, Multiplayer, Online
CCG – Collectible Card Game
RPG – Role Playing Game
What does it mean? It means we want to create a game for everyone - true fantasy fans and casual players both. You don't need to know tons of rules to play Crystalicum. You will be able to start a game quickly with your own starter deck of cards.
All cards will be collectible. It means that they will have their own value depending on their rarity, value in the game or even printed edition. There is a special mechanism in the game that will make it possible to exchange or trade the cards between the users, purchase of still available card decks or single copies of the cards.
In addition, we plan to implement to the game the advanced ability to affect your own character. According to the rules of RPG you will be able to develop yourself as well as to take part in various feature plots (yes, like every game based on a fable fantasy, it will have its own storyline, evolving in time).
Key Features:

Challenging gameplay

The possibility of playing on different platforms


The possibility of collecting cards


The possibility of developing your own character what affects the gameplay


The possibility of searching for suitable opponents

The possibility of configuring the match anyhow you want (i.e. non-ranking or ranking game, with or without the awards or based on making bets between players)
Local and international tournaments
The possibility of searching players near our location
A cumulative reedition of slightly changed basic card decks once a year (about 200 types of cards), new additional extensions every 3 months (about 100 types of new cards).

The possibility of playing in an extensive world existing in other media (i.e. RPGs, books, board games, etc.)

Translations. Confirmed languages are English and Polish. French, Spanish and German translations depend on reached goal. Additional translations will be done according to the available resources.
 

 
We have been working on Crystalicum for the past several months and we're very proud of what we've accomplished so far. Unfortunately, our savings are running out and we have been forced to do other work that sometimes takes 100% of our time, leaving none of it to focus on developing the game. That's why if we don’t reach our goal ($18000) the production time will significantly extend.
We chose Indiegogo because it's a very open funding platform (contrary to others similar to it), we feel we can only innovate without barriers by remaining independent. Developing games is so special to us, it’s in some way a part of our lives.
 

 
We believe we’ve found the team of experienced, enthusiastic developers and artists to pick up from the earlier version of game and we want to make Crystalicum something truly epic.
We could pay the people who have recently offered their help on the project and would be able to properly hire them what we can't do right now.
That’s why we hope to raise enough money to complete our game. Here is what we will use the money for:

Programming: in order to build such an advanced project like ours we will need help of external developers at the beginning. In the comfort of our homes game engine programming would be unnecessarily time and resource consuming. And good programmers tend to value their work so much.
Hosting: Server hosting costs money, especially the servers with high bandwidth. Your money will help us to provide dedicated servers right for the massive multiplayer game.
Art: Although our wonderful graphic designers have already put a lot of work in this game, in order to fully devote themselves to this project, they also need to pay their own bills without the need to seek for alternative sources of funds needed to survive. So let's appreciate their contributions.
Music & Sound Effects: Like every respected Role Playing Game, our game should also have its own individual climate (which we hope you heard in our pitch movie). And it's extremely hard to create it without the good sound quality and inspiring music. And also the good musician must eat sometimes.
Administrative costs: running a business plus legal and tax advice.
Marketing costs: if it's meant to be a Massie Multiplayer Game we need to achieve an appropriate recognition of it, even in the markets where our products have not been released yet. Thus, part of the funds will be dedicated to supporting You. Above all, thanks to you – the players - we have the best possible ways of advertising - recommending the product to others!
Our own Survival: Rent, food... and internet to keep us still working on the game.
To finish our project and bring you a polished game, we will need about 6-12 months, working on it full time. That's why we need the funds necessary to keep us going. That brings us to the next question:
How does this crowd funding work?
Easy. You pledge an amount of money you choose (see the sidebar to the right). The pledge will be withdrawn from your account immediately. When the collecting is complete, the funds are transferred to us. Then we are sending the awards to you and continue our work.
 

 
If the unlikely event happen that funding were to overshoot our goal, and we exceed the minimal goal (if we aren’t asleep right now and dreaming), we will be able to bring you more cool stuff. Underneath we show you the stretch goals we managed to achieve:
1. Translations: we already mentioned that if the goal is reached at the level of:

$10000 - we will translate the game to Spanish language
$20000 - we will translate the game to French language
$30000 - we will translate the game to German language
2. If we reach our minimal goal ($18000) we will print the first edition of the game and it will be possible to buy it directly from us (or receive - look at the perks).
3. If we reach $30000 goal, we will be able to develop the game on every platform we would like to and start them at the same time. As mentioned above we want to give you the possibility of playing wherever you are and whenever you want!
4. If we reach $50000 we will be able to arrange a launch party in selected region and print at least two editions of the game.
5. If we reach $70000 we will do all the above plus we will be able to create comic book, book or animated mini series about adventures in Crystalicum universe.
 

 
We’re sure you’ve noticed the large amount of money we’re requesting to finish our game. Believe it or not, this sum could be higher, if we haven’t managed to use lots of arts and game concepts from the earlier developed games. We want to be honest so here’s the breakdown of how the money will be spent:

66% - Game development
12% - Marketing costs
8% - Sallary
4% - Hosting services
4% - Accounting, tax & legal advice
3% - Rent
3% - other administrative costs
One final note: Indiegogo will deliver the cash as soon as we meet our first funding goal of $18000. So that means the sooner we reach that goal, the sooner we can get started on Crystalicum, the sooner we can show you progress, and the sooner we can release it. So if you intend to contribute, please do so at your earliest possible convenience!
 

 
We’re open to suggestions and ideas! And even though we have a pretty precise picture of what the game should look like (game mechanism have some limitations), we welcome helpful advices and honest opinions. Please write it here in comments or just e-mail us on indiegogo@crystalicum.eu
 

 
If we achieved our first goal, to finish game we will need about 8-12 months, working on it full time.
First closed beta (for limited testers, also recruited among You – look for the right perks) should be ready after 3-5 months after finishing this campaign.
We will open the game for everyone but with not all of it's functions completed and still in beta version probably 6-8 month from now (to exclude as much errors and engine balance as possible).
 

 
The game will be primarily a browser game. Available both on your own website as well as on selected social networks such as Facebook or other regional networks.
The game will also be available (in a less complex form) on mobile platforms such as iOS or Android.
All platforms will be using the same database – which means that wherever you play - you always have the access to your cards!
 

 
Of course this wouldn’t be a crowdfunding effort without goodies to motivate you to contribute. Here’s a run-down all of the individual rewards we’re offering:

Spread the word and share the campaign via Indiegogo tools, on social networks, blogs, forums - basically everywhere. Talk to friends and other gamers about it. Share the link. There are hundreds of thousands of fans out there, but many of them are not plugged in to the community and are hard for us to find. Let them know that today is the day!
 

 
The more noise we make, the more money we’ll raise, and the more likely this campaign will keep Crystalicum and its community growing. To encourage you to get all of your friends and neighbors to join the fun, we will grant a special award. The award will go to whoever brings the most contributions in using Indiegogo’s sharing tools. So even if you can’t afford to contribute yourself, you can still win if you manage to gather most of the money through your own connections and campaigning.
If you can’t contribute and want to go for the prize, just be sure to create an Indiegogo account and use its tools!
 

 
1. Risk of delay. There is always a possibility that the game will be delayed due to technical problems, unforeseen circumstances, also, like all creative projects, some mechanics may be changed if we consider them to be hurting the game - but don't worry, we will do everything so that you (and us) will get to play the game as soon as possible.2. Shipping international orders. Please add $5 for shipping within Poland, $25 for shipping within Europe and $35 for the rest of the world. I know, that's high, but shipping costs are insane. :( Shipping will be included starting with the $150 perk.3. How many languages does Crystalicum support? The confirmed languages are English and Polish - French, Spanish, German and other additional translations will be done according to available resources (as we mentioned at the begining of the page).4. When will I get my rewards? Some of the rewards will be delivered after the final release of the game, although some digital rewards or game rewards may be sent to you sooner.
5. Upgrading pledges: Want to upgrade your contribute? No problem! Indiegogo doesn’t support it directly, so here’s how to do it:

1. Make a new contribute in the amount equal to the difference between the perks.
2. Send us an e-mail at indiegogo@crystalicum.eu along with your username and describe the upgrade.
For example: You pledged $30 to get the Adventurer perk and want to get the Merchant, so you contribute an additional 20$ and drop us a mail. Easy!
6. Table game rewards: As we mentioned in perks decription, the ammount of reward games are limited. So if it is not written directly in the perk you will receive the game when:

you're one of the first who contribute to the game
you declare that you want it (in perks where shipping cost must be added, we will contact you if you don't contact us)
 

 
Our final words...
Crystalicum is in your hands. By now you probably already decided whether you'd like to help our project or not. So all we can add is that we'll do our best to try and answer any questions you may have in an upcoming updates.
Remember: together we can create something truly memorable!
Thank you for reading this!

<p><br/>[PAYPAL PAYMENTS ONLY BECAUSE ITS A CANADIAN PROJECT]</p>
<p>[BECAUSE OF SEVERAL REQUESTS ONCE I AM FINISHED DEVELOPING ON BLACKBERRY 10 I AM GOING TO PORT FINAL VERSION TO ANDROID AND WINDOWS PHONE.]</p>
</div>
<div>Hello Generous Gamers, my name is Tony Mountjoy and I have a game idea I'd like to develop on mobile platforms. I've been programming professionally for almost 14 years working mostly in the C programming language on desktops, servers, and clusters.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Though I have found success writing business applications for my company Asmotek, which I really enjoy, I'd like to try building an entertainment product based on my own creative ideas. I've programmed the game framework and developed the story, but I can't do all the audio, graphics and acting for the animations on my own.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have a green screen studio and a working partnership with a local Gemini award winning sound studio, Talking Dog Studios, who are interested in helping me create a rich sound library, which is critical to a good horror game.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>What I Need And What You Get</strong></h3>
<div>
<div>I am aiming for at least $15000.00 in funding mostly for sound and video development with the actors I need to bring into my studio for the animation sequences. I've already spent the last couple of months developing the code set, refining the interface, debugging, writing story scripts and beta testing performance.</div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With your help I can hire the artists and actors I need to finish the first version and set the standard for new content down the road. The actors will be used for digital animation sequences, mostly monster silhouettes and other game characters. I also need to complete the hook for the ""Boss Challenge"" and fine tune the mini-games that are triggered along the story arc.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you help me I will create a cool game series that my company and I will actively support with upgrades and new content, and provide ""Director's Cut"" versions for early supporters, including out takes, special audio, and animations that won't be published to the general audience. At the very least I will give a copy of the game with a thank you note.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If I don't reach the funding goal I will use what money I was able to raise and though it will take longer, fund the difference out of pocket to get version 1 out and hopefully gain enough interest and revenue from downloads to improve it and fund new content. </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I really want to see this game series out there because of the focus on story and the players' unique moves of developing the character and game experience. I like this kind of game. Every choice informs future events ultimately weaving a personal experience while staying true to the over all story arc, kind of like ""a choose your own adventure rpg"" from back in the day but with all the media and features I've come to expect from a modern piece of software. I want to tell a great story in a new way with unique replayability.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Please keep up on the game's latest developments and support text heavy games in general. They are good for the mind :) Also If you know someone who likes the horror genre, please tell them about my project!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks alot!!!!</div></span></div>","Summary

Hello Generous Gamers, my name is Tony Mountjoy and I have a game idea I'd like to develop on mobile platforms. I've been programming professionally for almost 14 years working mostly in the C programming language on desktops, servers, and clusters.

<p>Looking on
what has been drawn/coded/composed so far, I will need five more months to make
this game the strategy game I imagine it to be. In order to cover the
development costs I need to raise 6,000$. </p>
<p>Without the full amount, i will only continue to work on this project in my spare time. So if reaching funding goal fails, i will offer you the choice to get all of your money back or receive a smaller version of the game at the end of march.</p>

<p>This is why
I’m turning to my supporters who love strategy and tower-defense just as much
as I do. In exchange for your support you will get the game for a discount

everyone who enjoys a challenge. Furthermore I will be able to finish the game

<p><i>""The garage company""</i></p>
<p>As
I already mentioned, I am a German independent game developer that is living
the dream of making a game single handed while living at the brink of poverty.
This is also why 6,000$ are enough money for me to finish the project, I work
alone and I don’t have much expenses thanks to my good Samaritan parents.</p>
<p><i>""Why a turn-based tower defense?""</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>I always
loved strategy games and I wanted to make a game that offers a wide variety of
strategic choices within a complex system, but is easy to understand and
interact with. That is why I started to make a more complex tower defense that
plays like a classic rts, but all turn based to take out the stress factor of
micro management and focus more on the decision making.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
</div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/944845/files/20141020072814-HeaderBanner02_RisksChallenges.png?1413815294"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The Concept<br/>was always risky, because combining tower defense with turn based sounds like adding boring to boring. A Tower defense game can easily become underwhelming and repetitive and combing this with turn based gaming can make the game very slow and tedious.<br/>That is when i discovered that i have to put a high focus on level design. Each level has to play differently teaching you something new every time, almost like a puzzle-solving game. And second of all there has to be constant threat, imminent danger and lot of attackers to avoid meaningless turns.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Single Man Army<br/>is what i could call myself. Going alone at a project is usually insane and a bad business decision. Specialization is the key and suddenly you have to be the coder, artist, game designer, level designer, marketing guy and clever business man (Oh and where is the sound and trailer guy?). I focus on design, code and art in this order, i can pull it off pretty good and i am improving every day, but the key to work as a single man army is pretty much just self-discipline. (Also i get help with the sound.. )<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>To small, to much competition<br/>is the risk that concludes from both the challenges above. Working alone limits the size of the projects and a small tower defense game can be found as a flash-game in the internet as easy as searching for cat pictures.<br/>So the concept was that i wanted to create an easy accessible strategy game with deep tactical decision making. The size of the project grew to differ from other tower-defense games and become something unique. So now i need help to get towards the finish line.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Flexible money goal,<br/>is what i have chosen for this campaign. By now i regret that i have chosen this type of funding, but i offer you the following, as stated in the ""Goals"" chapter.<br/>If i don't reach the full 6,000$ goal, i will continue to work on this project in my spare time and you will receive a smaller version of the game by the end of march. If you dislike that i offer you the choice to get your money back.</li>

Hello to
you from Funtraum Games!  Funtraum Games
is me, a game developer from Germany, that country famous for its video game
simulations, strategy games and building games. I’ve been workingfor five years
in the video game industry before I decided to go full indie with my very own
project Build&Battle.








Build&Battle
is a turn-based tower-defense game that plays like a classic strategy game. It
is an accessible strategy game that encourages meaningful tactical decisions. For
nine months I’ve been working on this project and currently it can even be
greenlit on Steam. I want fans of strategy and tower-defense games alike to
enjoy Build&Battle and its unique gameplay mix. And for this I need your
help.
Build&Battle will be available for PC,Linux and Mac.


                                               
Frogmen with a club: ""I hit things good.""








Looking on
what has been drawn/coded/composed so far, I will need five more months to make
this game the strategy game I imagine it to be. In order to cover the
development costs I need to raise 6,000$. 
Without the full amount, i will only continue to work on this project in my spare time. So if reaching funding goal fails, i will offer you the choice to get all of your money back or receive a smaller version of the game at the end of march.



This is why
I’m turning to my supporters who love strategy and tower-defense just as much
as I do. In exchange for your support you will get the game for a discount
price compared to what it would cost when released on steam. (For more details
check perks)

Your
contribution will help me to create a very unique tower-defense experience for
everyone who enjoys a challenge. Furthermore I will be able to finish the game
I always wanted to do and whose mechanics and rules are on my mind day and
night. I want to thank everyone who decides to support me and hope that everybody
will sooner or later enjoy the unique mix of tower-defense and strategy games I
will bring to your PC. 












You build
structures, harvest resources, upgrade buildings, train units, research
technologies and fight approaching enemies.

The core
idea is to create an easy accessible strategy game that focuses more on the
decision making rather than the micromanagement. This is why Build&Battle
has become a turn based tower-defense, with every turn unfolding the sum of all
your strategic decisions.

In every
turn you gain resources from woodcutters or masons and spend it for placing new
towers, training units and researching tech. You plan what your towers and
units will do and end the turn to see the effects of all your orders unfold. Watch

Elemental Orbs

A very important mechanic that makes the game more complex are the element orbs found in temples. They can be combined to create a wide array of different attacks.

All

can be applied to any tower, modifying its damage type, amount, range and so
on. There are four orb slots for every tower and it plays a bit like in
magicka. Use these elements within a tower to specialize it with elemental
advantages, combine the orbs to mix elements and create even new elements!



                                 
Dying Quapp: ""Nevermind.""

Buildings
A collection of some building sprites with their upgrades.















                           
Dancing-Donkey: ""IIIHH - AAAH!""





Each setting has its own worldmap, wich is reachable from one central hub level.


The worldmaps and general settings are: Swamp/ Jungle; Dead Forest; Necropolis; Desert Land; Demon World. A
linear story will be your path through this worldmaps and keep you going until
the last level is successfully cleared.



Within the
worldmaps there are several levels that can be played in a nonlinear order.
Each level unlocks technologies and upgrades and helps you to progress through
the levels.
Upgrades
and towers you just unlocked will help you making the choice on where and how to
strike next.


                               
Dying Frog-men guy: ""Better take a nap.""



The story is not transported with long texts or mission briefings that the player has to go through, but will be delivered by strong visuals that tell the player about the world and what may happened there.
Short ingame cutscenes will help the plot to thrive.
A magical medieval themed world protects itself from unkown evil with the power of the crystal. Nobody really understands its powers, but it sustained peace and prosperity since ancient times and people pray to the crystal.
The players story starts with the events shown in the trailer. The crystals got weaker and finally cracked, the protection is lost, but a portal to a new mysterious world offers new opportunities to restore the crystals power.

What kind of game related crowd funding campaign would this be without stretch goals? I have to say, that I don’t intend to make the project bigger that I already planned to do. I want to focus on finishing Build&Battle as soon as possible, but of course I have some ideas that would add even more value to the game.










With
the first stretch goal the base version of the game will be expanded to give
the player more options for building and combat phases and increase the strategic
potentials of the game.










Stretch
Goal 2 is meant to make Build&Battle a full strategy game that can stand
its ground against the big ones.



While this
stretch goal doubles the amount of work that has to be done, I it will only add
two more months of work on top of the release date since I will hire additional manpower
to finish the game.




Development Roadmap









Where does the money go?
6000$ are not much money for game development nowadays, but i work alone and i mainly need to cover my low living expenses:








  


""The garage company""
As
I already mentioned, I am a German independent game developer that is living
the dream of making a game single handed while living at the brink of poverty.
This is also why 6,000$ are enough money for me to finish the project, I work
alone and I don’t have much expenses thanks to my good Samaritan parents.
""Why a turn-based tower defense?""

I always
loved strategy games and I wanted to make a game that offers a wide variety of
strategic choices within a complex system, but is easy to understand and
interact with. That is why I started to make a more complex tower defense that
plays like a classic rts, but all turn based to take out the stress factor of
micro management and focus more on the decision making.



  



The Conceptwas always risky, because combining tower defense with turn based sounds like adding boring to boring. A Tower defense game can easily become underwhelming and repetitive and combing this with turn based gaming can make the game very slow and tedious.That is when i discovered that i have to put a high focus on level design. Each level has to play differently teaching you something new every time, almost like a puzzle-solving game. And second of all there has to be constant threat, imminent danger and lot of attackers to avoid meaningless turns.

Single Man Armyis what i could call myself. Going alone at a project is usually insane and a bad business decision. Specialization is the key and suddenly you have to be the coder, artist, game designer, level designer, marketing guy and clever business man (Oh and where is the sound and trailer guy?). I focus on design, code and art in this order, i can pull it off pretty good and i am improving every day, but the key to work as a single man army is pretty much just self-discipline. (Also i get help with the sound.. )

To small, to much competitionis the risk that concludes from both the challenges above. Working alone limits the size of the projects and a small tower defense game can be found as a flash-game in the internet as easy as searching for cat pictures.So the concept was that i wanted to create an easy accessible strategy game with deep tactical decision making. The size of the project grew to differ from other tower-defense games and become something unique. So now i need help to get towards the finish line.

Flexible money goal,is what i have chosen for this campaign. By now i regret that i have chosen this type of funding, but i offer you the following, as stated in the ""Goals"" chapter.If i don't reach the full 6,000$ goal, i will continue to work on this project in my spare time and you will receive a smaller version of the game by the end of march. If you dislike that i offer you the choice to get your money back.




  How to support Build&Battle without giving money?
If you wan't to help me, but you don't wan't to buy the game or have no money to spend, maybe a friend of yours is a crazy tower defense/ strategy/ turn based maniac that needs to know about this project. Sharing is caring!",50.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Shooteria is a 3D game designed to promote IPSC shooting worldwide. We did develop a game in which a player is able to shoot various stages from different matches and compete online with other players, by using the IPSC scoring system. We need your help to publish our Trial version and keep working to extend it to reach our final goal which is a multiplayer game.</p>
<p>It may your target be in the stage, but our target is to offer you a fully functionable game in which you will be a able to spend nice moments with your friends and shooters worldwide. We want to create a 3D shooting world in a multiplayer environment in which each shooter will grow his skills from the beginning, earn money, buy new guns and ammo, customize his gun and generally interact with other players (chat, shootoffs, exchange items, drink coffee, etc.)</p>
<p>Help us to make our shooting world for our favourite sport by contributing in this campaign!</p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.bitmyjob.gr/shooteria/ourprofile.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>Our first involvement with IPSC shooting starts around 1999, in which we got our first experience in shooting with pistols. As IPSC Lovers (!!!) we spent a lot of hours in the shooting range to improve our skills and we did participate in many seminars related with IPSC shooting. We got a deep experience in this sport not only in knowledge related with training but also in gunsmithing and range officials. In 2005, we did create the first online shooting community in Greece called “Shooters”, in which our goal was to make an online place for daily discussions in shooting related issues. Since then, the “Shooters” hosts more than 2.500 Greek shooters and more than 60.000 posts. In 2010, we launched a bi-monthly unique and high-qualitative magazine publication, dedicated to IPSC shooting in Greece. One year later, in cooperation with one of the world most famous company “Double Alpha Academy - DAA”, we did launch the “WorldShootPhotos” project in which we did provide digital photos to shooters during the World Shoot event in Rhodes. As soon as the World Shoot in Rhodes was over, we came up with the “Shooteria” idea in which now we ask for your help to make it happen.</p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.bitmyjob.gr/shooteria/ourmotivation.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>Our studies in computing gave us the opportunity to start thinking a way on how we can use our skills in programming to promote this lovely sport. We came up with this idea, in which every shooter from all over the world will be able to have fun when he is away from the shooting range. This is not only a game, it can be a very useful tool for everyone who wants to improve his skills in IPSC shooting.</p>
<p>We are excited with this idea, and we hope you get excited too. The Trial version of Shooteria is almost ready. We did the major work and we did implement some basic graphics and core programming. We need your help to get it further...</p>

Wikiduca presenta un juego de cartas que potencia su capacidad intelectual.
Esperamos que disfrutes de nuestro juego y de nuestras recompensas:



Puedes confiar en nosotros:


Nuestro primer juego, creado para aprender inglés gratis, se usa en 10 países dentro y fuera del ámbito escolar. Nuestro éxito y nuestra dedicación nos avalan:

Nuestra misión es educar en valores y cada día la vivimos con intensidad.
Trabajamos con niños, padres y maestros para crear los mejores juegos educativos y las historias más cautivadoras para ayudar a educar a los niños:

Entendemos nuestra responsabilidad y la disfrutamos con dedicación y compromiso.
Aunque nadie te lo diga, tus hijos necesitan juegos educativos como el nuevo juego de Wikiduca:

Como padre o madre, seguro que has oído hablar de los juegos de desarrollo cognitivo. Incluso de hijos como los tuyos, que cada día se divierten mientras desarrollan su mente.
Este tipo de juegos existe desde tiempos inmemoriales pero el desarrollo cognitivo, como campo científico, está todavía en su infancia. ¡El primer test de inteligencia no se inventó hasta el siglo pasado!
Aunque todo el mundo sabe que estimular la mente de sus hijos es bueno, pocos REALMENTE conocen el poder de los juegos de desarrollo cognitivo actuales.


¿Estos juegos son para tus hijos?

Sepas lo que sepas (o no sepas) sobre estos juegos, tienes que oír esto:
La ciencia demuestra que parte de la inteligencia es lotería genética, pero los estudios más actuales (Jaeggi) desvelan un secreto desconocido hasta ahora:
La memoria funcional almacena los datos que necesitamos para procesar cualquier acción o pensamiento. ¡Potenciar la memoria funcional aumenta la capacidad intelectual en todas las áreas cognitivas!
¿Y por qué debería importarte? ¡Porque afecta a todo lo que hacemos!
¡Tus hijos necesitan ejercitarla para alcanzar su máximo potencial!


Un hecho sorprendente:
Jaeggi realizó un estudio antes y después de que un grupo de niños ejercitaran su memoria funcional. Era el test de matrices de Raven, que proporciona una buena estimación del coeficiente intelectual.
Antes del ejercicio, el promedio de aciertos era de nueve matrices. Después de unos meses potenciando su memoria funcional…
¡El promedió de aciertos aumentó a trece matrices y media!

¿De verdad se puede potenciar la memoria funcional?
¡Claro que sí! Igual que un músculo, se puede ejercitar. ¡Imagina tener la memoria funcional de un detective, que maneja cientos de pistas en su cabeza para resolver un caso!


¿Pero cómo se hace?
¡Con juegos de desarrollo cognitivo como el juego de cartas de Wikiduca! Hace años que nos dedicamos a los juegos educativos pero nunca hemos encontrado nada más eficaz o emocionante que el desarrollo de la memoria funcional.


¿Y cómo funciona?

Hemos diseñado el juego para adaptarse al nivel de cada jugador y ayudar a desarrollar su máximo potencial.
Los niños deben elaborar estrategias con cartas visibles y no visibles y elegir la mejor jugada. Cuantas más cartas retienen en su cabeza, mejores jugadas pueden hacer.
¡Es un entrenamiento intenso de su memoria funcional!


¿Pero realmente necesito estos juegos para mis hijos? ¿No desarrollan su mente de forma natural?
¡Si, pero estos juegos les permiten alcanzar su máximo potencial! Aún no hemos conocido ningún padre que no quiera lo mejor para sus hijos. ¡Esperamos que siga siendo así!


Para niños de 6 a 12 años:
Wikiduca está diseñado a medida para adaptarse a sus habilidades.

A team will consist of you and 4 other players who will each have 2 AI troops under their control. This means a team of 5 ""real"" players is actually a team of 15 at the beginning of the game.  5 players controlling 3 characters each equals 15 per team.

</div></div>","Bonjour à tous, Je m'appelle Alain Truffier (Alias Angelstar) et je suis le créateur de plusieurs jeux en ligne dont 650km.com et Druidik.com. J'ai fondé mon entreprise ""Les mots dits Français"" pour permettre aux milliers de joueurs en ligne de profiter de nouveaux concepts, add-on et animations au sein de mes jeux. Ce projet de financement INDIEGOGO est le début d'une série qui me permettra d'améliorer l'activité ludo-éducative du jeu ""650km.com perdu dans l'océan"" tout en permettant à tous les joueurs de profiter du thème du jeu, le dépaysement total !
 
POURQUOI J'AI BESOIN DE VOUS ET QU'Y GAGNEZ-VOUS?
 Ce premier projet INDIEGOGO consiste à financer la mise en place d'un système de concours pour le jeu gratuit 650km.com où plus de 500 000 joueurs s'amusent gratuitement à vivre des aventures palpitantes depuis 2006; ce concours permettra d'offrir des lots de voyages réels aux gagnants!
Grâce au financement de ce projet, je pourrais lancer le concours entre le 15 Juillet et le 15 Aout 2013, ce qui permettra à tout le monde d'avoir sa chance de gagner d'autres vacances au soleil!Si vous n'êtes pas joueur : Pas de problème ici, ce projet pourra vous intérresser car tout contributeur aura un gain et en tant que nouvel inscrit vous aurez autant de chance d'obtenir un lot que les autres.
Croyez les milliers de joueurs actuels, vous passerez du bon temps à jouer gratuitement à 650km et à rejoindre cette grande communauté de joueurs francophones. Que vous soyez un joueur vétéran ou nouvellement inscrit, vous aurez la chance de participer à ce concours (sans obligation d'achat) et de gagner des vacances de rêve tout en vous amusant! Le jeu a déjà profité de nombreuses mises à jour et l'une des dernières a été la mise en place d'un système de concours où les joueurs peuvent, en effectuant quelques actions, gagner des lots collectors ou rares.
Les joueurs vivent virtuellement sur une archipel paradisiaque (ou presque!), alors pourquoi pas faire se rejoindre la réalité à la virtualité et LES faire partir sur une île réelle pour des vacances de rêve !
Chaque contribution que vous ferez me permettra de mettre en place tout le concours (graphismes et développement) et de vous proposer des lots et des voyages de meilleures qualités.
 
QUEL SERA LE CONCOURS ET LES LOTS QUE VOUS GAGNEREZ
 
Les règles du concours qui sera lancé entre le 15 Juillet et le 15 Aout seront :Jouez à 650km.com et cumulez l'objet ""COQUILLAGE DORE"" en utilisant l'action ""TROUVER DES VACANCES"" sur l'environnement ""PLAGE"" ou en faisant des échanges d'objets sur différents environnement du jeu. Plus vous en cumulez et plus vous grimpez dans le classement !1 ""COQUILLAGE DORE"" vaut 5 POINTS.OU Achetez directement 100 COQUILLAGES DORES pour seulement 150 KM-POINTS et montez de 500 points!
Les 2000 premiers joueurs du classement auront des lots distribués selon 6 paliers suivants :
1er : Le voyage de votre choix pour une valeur de 3000$
2e >> 20e : 2 arbres à guarana (fournissent 2 graines de guarana chaque jours!)
21e >> 50e : 1 épée magnétique
50e >> 300e : 1 boite de 20 sachet de thé
301e >> 1000e : 200 points d'aventures
1001e >> 2000e : 3 sachet de thé

A QUOI SERVIRA VOTRE CONTRIBUTION?
 
Afin de produire les parties graphiques et techniques du concours, nous avons besoin de 1000$, 
Cela nous permettra de créer toutes les actions, objets et interactions nécessaires.
500$ serviront à rembourser les intervenants 
Ceux qui ont déjà travaillé sur la mise en place de ce projet sur Indiegogo (graphiste, correcteur, commercial).
Nous réservons 500$ de budget marketing 
Afin de lancer les lettres d'information, le relai des sites partenaires ainsi que les annonces sur les réseaux sociaux.
Un budget de 3000$ est donc alloué pour l'achat du voyage 
Vous partirez à la date qu'il vous convient et pour la destination que vous souhaitez.
Que vous désirez partir dans le Jura, en Estrie ou partout dans le monde, seul, entre amis, en famille ou en amoureux, nous communiquerons ensemble afin de planifier vos vacances (à hauteur de 3000$ maximum).
 Le cahier des charges consiste à créer les graphismes et le développement des actions et objets suivants :* La création du concours, son règlement, son fonctionnement, le système de distribution des lots.* 1 série d'icônes de l'objet ""coquillage doré""* 27 séries d'icônes permettant les échanges de ressources naturelles récoltées dans le jeu contre des ""coquillages dorés"".

En fonction de votre niveau de contribution sur Indiegogo vous pourrez obtenir des objets COLLECTOR, des POINTS d'AVENTURES (qui s'échangent contre des objets rares dans le jeu) des KM-POINTS (monnaie virtuelle pour obtenir des objets collectors) ainsi que de nombreux autres objets tel que des armures, armes et artefacts).
        
SI LES FONDS NE SONT PAS ATTEINTS?
Le concours sera maintenu bien entendu mais il n'y aura que des lots in-game collector, les fonds récoltés serviront à payer les intervenants du concours, seront partagés à part égale en campagne google pour la promotion du jeu puis en coût de maintien technique du jeu et des serveurs.
Tous les joueurs contributeurs recevront tout de même les rétributions pour lesquels ils ont payés.LE DEUXIEME EFFET INDIEGOGO! Vos contributions serviront à plusieurs niveaux pour l'avenir du jeu : 1° La mise en place de ce concours pour vous faire voyager comme indiqué plus haut
 2° Si le financement est atteint et que le projet abouti, cela me permettra de promouvoir la fidélité de la communauté de 650km auprès de studios de développement partenaires qui ont besoin d'éléments crédibles pour entreprendre le financement global de la prochaine version du jeu, la V3D!
(Pour voir un aperçu de ce que nous voulons vous offrir comme prochaine version, grâce à Unity3D cliquez sur ce lien Youtube).
 Pour être précis, de nombreux studios partenaires de développement sont interréssés pour développer la version 3D de 650km qui pourra être financée sur INDIEGOGO intégralement, mais pour cela ces studios ont besoin de voir que ce système de financement est fonctionnel et que la communauté est prête à contribuer à son développement tout en gagnant des avantages substanciels pour cette future version. J'ai déjà testé un principe de financement similaire avec des régies publicitaires qui m'a permis de créer plusieurs add-on du jeu, le livre des anciens, le tir au lapin, les systèmes de déménagement de campement, l'optimisation technique du moteur de jeu, etc. Ces évolutions ont pu être effectuées en grande partie grâce à vous et je vous en remercie!
 La prochaine version du jeu pourra être développée dans le même cadre incluant l'aspect rétribution d'INDIEGOGO, et qui convient parfaitement à mon état d'esprit.Ce projet de financement est donc faisable grâce à nous tous et il aura un serieux impact sur la viabilité du jeu à long terme.D'AUTRES FACON D'AIDER Bien entendu, et toujours en accord avec mon état d'esprit, si vous ne pouvez pas contribuer financièrement pour ce projet, vous pouvez m'aider à en partageant l'existence de ce financement sur vos sites, blogs, pages facebook et tous réseaux sociaux où vous êtes présent.
 N'oubliez pas d'utilisez les outils de partage INDIEGOGO, ceux-ci sont simples d'utilisation et leurs impacts seront utiles au projet à coup sûr!",10.0,0,"14 Campaigns

<p><span>So
many dogs are abandoned each day, that dog shelters fill up and have
trouble feeding and taking care of them. Many of the dog shelters
function only because volunteers devote their money and time to help. It is said that around 4 million dogs get abandoned every year in the USA alone, and only 1 out of 10 dogs born will ever find a permanent home.</span></p>

<span></span><h3>Bugbyte and Ace Tales Big Mission <br/>
</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Bugbyte started in March 2012, consisting of two brothers with a passion and joy for gaming. We love games and have been playing games since early childhood. We also love animals and especially dogs. That's why we decided to combine the two!<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Ace Tales is a game meant to support dog shelters all over the world.
This game will be free to play with in-app purchases and advertisement, helping create
real life value to homeless dogs. We here at Bugbyte have a vision to
unite gaming and helping, by making revolutionary mobile games.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>Bugbyte
already has developed a game called Daredogs, focusing on helping dog shelters all over the world. The new game will work
with the same concept, but this time we are more serious and doing it in a professional way.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>Join
us on the adventure to make a difference in a homeless dogs life. We
find that a game that unites the whole world to help is an idea to
fight for!</span></p></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><h3><span><p><b>How
does it work exactly?</b></p></span></h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>Ace Tales will be published worldwide on Android and iOS, meaning most of
the mobile devices today will be covered. As an easy to play game, it
will contain a charity challenge feature, where you - the players - get
us to donate simply by playing the game! </span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/42227/files/20130830014944-HowDoesItWork.png?1377852584"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Players main objective will be to collect dog biscuits, which are floating around in the game and rewarded when missions are completed. These biscuits can be donated to a biscuit pool, and when the pool is full the challenge is beaten! Players all over the world collect biscuits to this pool together.<br/><span></span>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>This
is all possible due to our revenue model. Our game revenue will
consist of in-app purchases but advertisement revenue will also play a big
part. The advertisement revenue is the reason why anyone can
play the game for free and make a difference in a homeless dogs
life. As a total we will donate 10-20% of the proceeds from Ace Tales.
Our key focus is to become a company that can make many games, and find new dog shelters to help!</span></p>
<h3>Why are we doing all of this?</h3>
<p>We want to combine our joy and passion for both gaming and dogs. Our dog Pikko made our childhood a much happier one. He was always there greeting us when we came home, like he had not seen us in 10 years. This is our way of giving back. <br/></p>
<p>Yes, we want to be a successful company but we also want to give back and be part of something bigger. It's the way of life we have chosen. Our mission is to make one of the best games ever, so that you will be entertained and feed a homeless dog at the same time!<br/></p>
<h3><span><p><b>Why
indiegogo?</b></p></span></h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>Bugbyte
and its projects have been entirely self-funded up until this point.
We risked it all to go indie and try to unite entertainment with real
life helping. We have completed one project (Daredogs), and are very far on our
second one (Ace Tales). Now we want to pre-sell Ace Tales
products and Diamond packs for the game, to fully realize the Ace
Tales potential.  </span>

<p><span>If
everything goes well, this game will be able to support multiple dog
shelters with monthly donations. Which in turn will provide food and
care for many many homeless dogs. If our game is a success our
company will also be better fit to make new games in the near future,
with the same concept.</span></p>

</p>
</span></span><span>We
feel very confident in our capabilities to complete this project, because we
have done it before. Even though we are a young team, we have already
gathered up a lot of experience. We know so much better now what it
takes to make a good game. Our working methods have also changed to
much more efficient ones, striding the project forward at a good
pace.</span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">
<p>
</p>
<p><span>1. The
difficulty of porting the game to iOS is a little unknown. Our game
development platform supports porting to some extent, but not yet
perfectly. It might require a little tweaking, but with time we will have
the game running on iOS as well.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Delays may occur with the deliveries of products if the amounts become really big, which we hope will happen by the way! Don't worry, we will work hard to get your purchases to you in a timely manner and keep you updated.</span></p>
<p><span>3. The confirmation of your order will be automatically e-mailed to you by indiegogo to the address you have provided to the service when signing up. <br/></span></p>
<p>4. Orders of the Hau-Hau Wildlife Toy and the Treat Maze by Nina Ottosson may be cancelled within 14 days of receipt of the delivery. If you wish to cancel an order of such products, please provide the seller Bugbyte Productions (VAT FI24658122) with a notice (including your bank account number) to the e-mail address support@bugbyte.fi and return the unopened products in their original condition to the address Bugbyte Productions, Käsityöläiskatu 4a, 20100 Turku, Finland, whereupon we will refund your payment for the returned products by bank transfer.</p>
<p>5. Please note that orders of other Ace products sold on this page are non-refundable and order cancellations cannot be accepted. However, all contributions are naturally refunded if our campaign is unsuccessful in accordance with<span> <a href=""http://support.indiegogo.com/entries/21081743-Refunds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">indiegogo's refund policy.</a></span></p>

are committed and ready to take on all the possible challenges that
may lie ahead of us. Since we are a small indie team it means we are

<p>
</p>
<p><b>How
much do you donate?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>As
with our last game called Daredogs, we donate 10% of proceeds to good
causes. We feel 10% is a good number, but hope to be able to donate
more in the future. Now, when we are in the beginning, we also need
money to build up the company.</span></p>
<p><span>If our 100 000 or 200 000$ stretch goals are met, we will up the donation ratio to 15% and 20% respectively!<br/></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>How
is it possible that I can play the game for free, and still help in real
life value?</b></p>
<p><span>Our
revenue model is based on in-app purchases and advertisement. So even</span><span> if
you don't buy anything, you are always worth something as a customer <span><span>for
advertising. It's just like in tv, the advertisements will have a
slight negative impact on the game, but they will also make donations
possible through free gaming.</span></span><br/></span></p>
<span>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>You
talk about a charity challenge, is it possible the challenge is never
beaten and you keep all the money?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>No.
The challenge will always be beaten eventually. Our key focus is to be able to donate as much as we can, while keeping our company making new games and finding new dog shelters to donate to. The donation amount
depends on how much the game has been played.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>If
I buy something in the game will I affect more?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>Yes. A portion (10-20%) of everything that is bought will be donated
to</span><span> dog
shelters.</span></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p><b><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></b></p>

Tales – A revolutionary flying adventure game, combining entertainment with helping homeless dogs. 



What if you could play an entertaining game on your mobile device, and help feed a homeless dog at the same time?
So
many dogs are abandoned each day, that dog shelters fill up and have
trouble feeding and taking care of them. Many of the dog shelters
function only because volunteers devote their money and time to help. It is said that around 4 million dogs get abandoned every year in the USA alone, and only 1 out of 10 dogs born will ever find a permanent home.

Our products available for pre-order
Please
 only enter a contribution that corresponds to the price of the perk you
 wish to purchase. Excess contributions will be treated as pre-orders 
for diamond packs and dog biscuits usable in the game with a code.To
 pre-order only diamond packs and dog biscuits, please choose ""No perk"" 
and enter a contribution corresponding to the amount of diamond packs 
and dog biscuits you wish to purchase.

Bugbyte and Ace Tales Big Mission 




Bugbyte started in March 2012, consisting of two brothers with a passion and joy for gaming. We love games and have been playing games since early childhood. We also love animals and especially dogs. That's why we decided to combine the two!
Ace Tales is a game meant to support dog shelters all over the world.
This game will be free to play with in-app purchases and advertisement, helping create
real life value to homeless dogs. We here at Bugbyte have a vision to
unite gaming and helping, by making revolutionary mobile games.



Bugbyte
already has developed a game called Daredogs, focusing on helping dog shelters all over the world. The new game will work
with the same concept, but this time we are more serious and doing it in a professional way.


Join
us on the adventure to make a difference in a homeless dogs life. We
find that a game that unites the whole world to help is an idea to
fight for!How
does it work exactly?






Ace Tales will be published worldwide on Android and iOS, meaning most of
the mobile devices today will be covered. As an easy to play game, it
will contain a charity challenge feature, where you - the players - get
us to donate simply by playing the game! 

Players main objective will be to collect dog biscuits, which are floating around in the game and rewarded when missions are completed. These biscuits can be donated to a biscuit pool, and when the pool is full the challenge is beaten! Players all over the world collect biscuits to this pool together.


This
is all possible due to our revenue model. Our game revenue will
consist of in-app purchases but advertisement revenue will also play a big
part. The advertisement revenue is the reason why anyone can
play the game for free and make a difference in a homeless dogs
life. As a total we will donate 10-20% of the proceeds from Ace Tales.
Our key focus is to become a company that can make many games, and find new dog shelters to help!
Why are we doing all of this?
We want to combine our joy and passion for both gaming and dogs. Our dog Pikko made our childhood a much happier one. He was always there greeting us when we came home, like he had not seen us in 10 years. This is our way of giving back. 
Yes, we want to be a successful company but we also want to give back and be part of something bigger. It's the way of life we have chosen. Our mission is to make one of the best games ever, so that you will be entertained and feed a homeless dog at the same time!
Why
indiegogo?






Bugbyte
and its projects have been entirely self-funded up until this point.
We risked it all to go indie and try to unite entertainment with real
life helping. We have completed one project (Daredogs), and are very far on our
second one (Ace Tales). Now we want to pre-sell Ace Tales
products and Diamond packs for the game, to fully realize the Ace
Tales potential.  






The
impact







If
everything goes well, this game will be able to support multiple dog
shelters with monthly donations. Which in turn will provide food and
care for many many homeless dogs. If our game is a success our
company will also be better fit to make new games in the near future,
with the same concept.
Together we can change the future for homeless dogs for the better, one dog at a time!

identifies.
Nina Ottosson
Nina Ottosson's philosophy is that the dog has four legs and one head, and all five need activity in different ways - both physical and mental. Nina Ottosson's range of durable interactive games have been designed to stimulate a dogs brain whilst reinforcing his relationship with people. Each design has a unique mechanism that requires mental as well as physical dexterity to work through the challenges and reveal hidden food rewards. 
Planet Pet Society
We are proud to offer your pet the best products available keeping your pet's well being in mind. We currently carry products for dogs and cats but in the near future our product range will also cover rodent and bird products too.

Risks, challenges and order cancellations





We
feel very confident in our capabilities to complete this project, because we
have done it before. Even though we are a young team, we have already
gathered up a lot of experience. We know so much better now what it
takes to make a good game. Our working methods have also changed to
much more efficient ones, striding the project forward at a good
pace.


1. The
difficulty of porting the game to iOS is a little unknown. Our game
development platform supports porting to some extent, but not yet
perfectly. It might require a little tweaking, but with time we will have
the game running on iOS as well.
2. Delays may occur with the deliveries of products if the amounts become really big, which we hope will happen by the way! Don't worry, we will work hard to get your purchases to you in a timely manner and keep you updated.
3. The confirmation of your order will be automatically e-mailed to you by indiegogo to the address you have provided to the service when signing up. 
4. Orders of the Hau-Hau Wildlife Toy and the Treat Maze by Nina Ottosson may be cancelled within 14 days of receipt of the delivery. If you wish to cancel an order of such products, please provide the seller Bugbyte Productions (VAT FI24658122) with a notice (including your bank account number) to the e-mail address support@bugbyte.fi and return the unopened products in their original condition to the address Bugbyte Productions, Käsityöläiskatu 4a, 20100 Turku, Finland, whereupon we will refund your payment for the returned products by bank transfer.
5. Please note that orders of other Ace products sold on this page are non-refundable and order cancellations cannot be accepted. However, all contributions are naturally refunded if our campaign is unsuccessful in accordance with indiegogo's refund policy.
6. Our privacy policy. Should you have any questions with regard to the products or this campaign, please contact us: support@bugbyte.fi


We
are committed and ready to take on all the possible challenges that
may lie ahead of us. Since we are a small indie team it means we are
also more dynamic, and adaptable to changes.
Frequently
asked questionsWhat happens if the goal of $50 000 is not reached?We will still complete the game for Android with basic features. Sadly, we cannot implement everything we wanted in the game. If the game brings us enough revenue, we will port the game to iOS later on.
We will also have to say good bye to Matti for now, which saddens us a lot.



How
much do you donate?


As
with our last game called Daredogs, we donate 10% of proceeds to good
causes. We feel 10% is a good number, but hope to be able to donate
more in the future. Now, when we are in the beginning, we also need
money to build up the company.
If our 100 000 or 200 000$ stretch goals are met, we will up the donation ratio to 15% and 20% respectively!


How
is it possible that I can play the game for free, and still help in real
life value?
Our
revenue model is based on in-app purchases and advertisement. So even if
you don't buy anything, you are always worth something as a customer for
advertising. It's just like in tv, the advertisements will have a
slight negative impact on the game, but they will also make donations
possible through free gaming.



You
talk about a charity challenge, is it possible the challenge is never
beaten and you keep all the money?


No.
The challenge will always be beaten eventually. Our key focus is to be able to donate as much as we can, while keeping our company making new games and finding new dog shelters to donate to. The donation amount
depends on how much the game has been played.



If
I buy something in the game will I affect more?


Yes. A portion (10-20%) of everything that is bought will be donated
to dog
shelters.
I want many different products, how can I get them?You can select and contribute multiple times. So select one perk and go ahead with payment. After it's done you can repeat the process with another perk you want.


How
do I choose the right t-shirt?
If your dog weighs 1-6kg or 2 to 13lbs choose the Ace Dog T-Shirt small. We will send you an e-mail and ask you for your dogs exact size and color preference.
If your dog weighs more than 6kg or 13lbs please choose the Ace Dog T-Shirt big. We will send you an e-mail and ask you for your dogs exact size and color preference.
We will contact you after the campaign is over and ask you for the exact size and color you want.


Do
I have to pay separately for shipping?


No.
We have included the price of shipping to the products, making it
easier for
you to participate.Get

<h1>The Story</h1>
<p>Bowslinger started with a simple, laser-cut acrylic plinker.
 After several (read: many) revisions to work out the dimensions and get
the trigger and spur operating correctly, we produced a few that worked<i>so well</i>, we wanted to
expand and bring this fun little device to others.</p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/567412/files/20140508202435-Early_Acrylics.jpg?1399605875"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/></figure><p>Further experimentation
showed that it wasn't going to be easy to produce consistent results on the
teensy tiny pieces when using the laser cutter.  After kicking around some
ideas and more experimentation, we determined that to produce a consistently
awesome product...  It really needed to be injection molded!</p><p>We took our original 2D CAD files and enlisted the help of a 3D modelling engineer we'd met online.  This guy works in the molding industry and his hobby is modelling and molding toy guns.  Talk about a match made in heaven!</p>
<p>We kicked around more ideas and came up with some drafts that
became our first CAD model.  We got a prototype made
using <a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)</span></a>.  It looked too realistic and
fired terribly!  Although Rev A was a beautiful device, it was way too realistic and the function just wasn't there.</p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/567417/files/20140508202752-Prototype_1_bad.jpg?1399606072"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/></figure><p>By changing the body profile and shifting the trigger mechanism higher in the body, we came up with a design that stretched the bands tight, low, and flat for jam-free loading while giving the band a nice ""kick"" upon release to smoothly clear it from the end hook. </p>
<p>We also decided to
move away from a realistic-looking gun.  It was never really the intention
(but our CAD guy was awesome at it!), and just didn't fit the spirit of the
project.</p>
<p>During some sketch
sessions, we realized just how close our new design ideas were to a classic
retro toy.  We changed the the shape and the proportions for rigidity
and firing constraints, but by squaring out the body while keeping the barrel
rounded we were able to make our improved design somewhat reminiscent of a classic shape
you'll know and love.  That's why we call this model ""The
8-bit""!</p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/567419/files/20140508202903-Prototype_B.jpg?1399606143"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/></figure><p>With CAD
files in hand, we began talking to vendors about tooling.  Our CAD
guy had quite a bit of molding experience and vendors were generally very pleased with
our design and mold strategy.  </p>
<p>But there were still a few more improvements for mass production
that we incorporated after prying tips and tricks from the molding guys.
 Some for rigidity and easy alignment, some for clean injection and
avoiding flow marks in the final plastic, and a couple to improve injection
resolution to the point where we could get very fine detail when the tooling
was built with <a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining).</span></a></p>
<p>The next revision incorporated the manufacturability tweaks from the molding guys.  We decided it would be nice to add a bit of color to the the
prototype, so we ran it through a round of fabric dye with great results!</p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/567421/files/20140508203102-Prototype_Red.jpg?1399606262"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/></figure><p>It looked good, and fired like a dream!</p>
<p>We found the Bowslinger worked best with authentic Rainbow Loom rubberbands.  Some after-market
loom bands were very soft and thin, and could potentially cause a jamming
problem during fast firing.  We decided
we needed to prevent this case entirely, so one more rev was made to allow slingin' of all types of mini rubberbands.</p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/567430/files/20140508203428-Prototype_purple.jpg?1399606468"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p></figure><h1>So... Is it going to work?<br/>
</h1>
<p>It sure is.
 We started way back in the CAD phase talking to molding vendors about all
aspects of the process: mold flow, molding variation, warp/sink/rigidity issues
among many others.  We've produced a design that is robust, reliable, and
easily manufacturable.  Actually, it's probably way overengineered for a
little plastic toy.  But that's exactly the way we want it.</p>
<p>Our CAD models
have been prototyped using high-resolution SLS and verified for smooth and reliable
operation.  They have been double, and triple checked by the EDM
(Electrical Discharge Machining) guys for production of a detailed and precise
mold.  And they have had tons of plastic flow analysis and modelling to
ensure excellent injection.  We've had more than one vendor tell us that
even our first CAD files were 100% manufacturable even before doing our final polishing on the design!</p>
<h1>The Bottom Line</h1>
<p>We believe in this project.  It's a cool device, and it's
going to be incredibly gratifying to have it produced in a slick and
professional form.  You may have noticed that Bowslinger's funding goal is
really quite low for an injection molding project.  That's because we
believe so strongly, and are so confident in the design that we <i>have already paid for most of
the tooling costs ourselves</i>.  </p>
<p>All costs from
start of tooling to preparation of the first test shots (coming soon!) have
already been 100% funded by us.  We need your help in funding the second
part of the tooling preparation and the setup and manufacturing fees for the
first production run.  It really is the final stretch here, folks.</p><p></p><h1>Schedule</h1><p>The tooling has just started.  It will take about 20 days to get a rough mold milled, at which point we will make ""T1"" test shots to check the injection, part fit and movement.  The results of that test will be posted here.</p><p>Then the mold needs about 7 days for final EDM shaping and polishing before ""T2"" test shots and color test can be done.</p><p>Once those are complete, we will be ready to do the first production run in early June and ship in Late June or early July.  This is not vaporware you'll wait a year for - if this Indiegogo campaign is successful, it will happen and it will happen NOW!</p><p></p><h1>Risk</h1><p>1) In the very worst case, our manufacturer botches T1-T3 test shots without providing a working device.  We have no further obligation to them, and we will walk away.  We will take <b>your</b> vote on whether to tool at our second manufacturer or just get your money back.</p><p>2) It works, but takes some tuning.  Our manufacturer has committed to tooling this to our satisfaction.  Small tuneups may take another week or two, and a full retool will be another month.  Again, we can walk away if the device is not molded to our satisfaction in 60 days.</p><p>3)The device is fully operational, but has cosmetic issues. A judgement call.  We won't accept a junky looking device, but we understand that weird molding marks or slight color mismatch is a risk in any injection molding project. We have negotiated up to 8 injection ports to minimize flow marks in the final product, and our vendor has assured us that our colors are among the easiest to produce. If the cosmetic issues are slight, we will move forward with production. If it looks terrible, we will exercise our right to walk away.</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p>
<h1>Help us Pick the Color!</h1><p><b>UPDATE: Our manufacturer has agreed to run a multiple-color run for our first batch.  Everyone will get the color they choose!  No voting necessary!</b></p><p><br/></p>
<p>Since we can have
the device molded in any standard Pantone color, there's literally thousands to
choose from.  We're opening a vote to choose the color of the first
production run to you, our backers!  </p>
<p>To make it easy
for you to consider the colors, we have narrowed the list down to a set of
colors that parallel the colors of standard Lego bricks.  So if you want to
see what our green will look like, go dig in the Lego pile to find yourself a
good old green brick.  That's it.  Pantone 348C. Beautiful!</p>
<p>The first tier of
contributions (only 8 bucks!) is set up to get you a completed Bowslinger  and a vote for your favorite color.  We hope your color wins,
but bear in mind that you will get a Bowslinger in the final winning color,
whatever it is. </p>
<p>Here's the list:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Red -<i><span>Pantone 032 C</span></i> 
(LEGO Bright Red)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Yellow -<i><span>Pantone 116 C</span></i> 
(LEGO Bright Yellow)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Green -<i><span>Pantone 348 C</span></i>(LEGO Dark Green)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Blue -<i><span>Pantone 293 C </span></i> 
(LEGO Bright Blue)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Purple -<i><span>Pantone 2685 C</span></i>(LEGO Medium Lilac)</p>
<p>The online color
charts for ABS are not great, so we suggest you look at real color swatches, or
simply real LEGO bricks to see how the final color looks in ABS.  All the
color choices are quite standard with the exception of Purple - that purple is
the deep, rich purple used for the Joker in the Lego Batman sets.  Another
great color, that one.</p>

production!  But hey, even if you aren't interested - please pass the project along to your mischievous friend.  ;)   @Wemakin, or on Facebook, or www.wemak.in.Just In - The first test shots of Bowslinger!
The Story
Bowslinger started with a simple, laser-cut acrylic plinker.
 After several (read: many) revisions to work out the dimensions and get
the trigger and spur operating correctly, we produced a few that workedso well, we wanted to
expand and bring this fun little device to others.

Further experimentation
showed that it wasn't going to be easy to produce consistent results on the
teensy tiny pieces when using the laser cutter.  After kicking around some
ideas and more experimentation, we determined that to produce a consistently
awesome product...  It really needed to be injection molded!We took our original 2D CAD files and enlisted the help of a 3D modelling engineer we'd met online.  This guy works in the molding industry and his hobby is modelling and molding toy guns.  Talk about a match made in heaven!
We kicked around more ideas and came up with some drafts that
became our first CAD model.  We got a prototype made
using SLS (Selective Laser Sintering).  It looked too realistic and
fired terribly!  Although Rev A was a beautiful device, it was way too realistic and the function just wasn't there.

By changing the body profile and shifting the trigger mechanism higher in the body, we came up with a design that stretched the bands tight, low, and flat for jam-free loading while giving the band a nice ""kick"" upon release to smoothly clear it from the end hook. 
We also decided to
move away from a realistic-looking gun.  It was never really the intention
(but our CAD guy was awesome at it!), and just didn't fit the spirit of the
project.
During some sketch
sessions, we realized just how close our new design ideas were to a classic
retro toy.  We changed the the shape and the proportions for rigidity
and firing constraints, but by squaring out the body while keeping the barrel
rounded we were able to make our improved design somewhat reminiscent of a classic shape
you'll know and love.  That's why we call this model ""The
8-bit""!

With CAD
files in hand, we began talking to vendors about tooling.  Our CAD
guy had quite a bit of molding experience and vendors were generally very pleased with
our design and mold strategy.  
But there were still a few more improvements for mass production
that we incorporated after prying tips and tricks from the molding guys.
 Some for rigidity and easy alignment, some for clean injection and
avoiding flow marks in the final plastic, and a couple to improve injection
resolution to the point where we could get very fine detail when the tooling
was built with EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining).
The next revision incorporated the manufacturability tweaks from the molding guys.  We decided it would be nice to add a bit of color to the the
prototype, so we ran it through a round of fabric dye with great results!

It looked good, and fired like a dream!
We found the Bowslinger worked best with authentic Rainbow Loom rubberbands.  Some after-market
loom bands were very soft and thin, and could potentially cause a jamming
problem during fast firing.  We decided
we needed to prevent this case entirely, so one more rev was made to allow slingin' of all types of mini rubberbands.


So... Is it going to work?

It sure is.
 We started way back in the CAD phase talking to molding vendors about all
aspects of the process: mold flow, molding variation, warp/sink/rigidity issues
among many others.  We've produced a design that is robust, reliable, and
easily manufacturable.  Actually, it's probably way overengineered for a
little plastic toy.  But that's exactly the way we want it.
Our CAD models
have been prototyped using high-resolution SLS and verified for smooth and reliable
operation.  They have been double, and triple checked by the EDM
(Electrical Discharge Machining) guys for production of a detailed and precise
mold.  And they have had tons of plastic flow analysis and modelling to
ensure excellent injection.  We've had more than one vendor tell us that
even our first CAD files were 100% manufacturable even before doing our final polishing on the design!
The Bottom Line
We believe in this project.  It's a cool device, and it's
going to be incredibly gratifying to have it produced in a slick and
professional form.  You may have noticed that Bowslinger's funding goal is
really quite low for an injection molding project.  That's because we
believe so strongly, and are so confident in the design that we have already paid for most of
the tooling costs ourselves.  
All costs from
start of tooling to preparation of the first test shots (coming soon!) have
already been 100% funded by us.  We need your help in funding the second
part of the tooling preparation and the setup and manufacturing fees for the
first production run.  It really is the final stretch here, folks.ScheduleThe tooling has just started.  It will take about 20 days to get a rough mold milled, at which point we will make ""T1"" test shots to check the injection, part fit and movement.  The results of that test will be posted here.Then the mold needs about 7 days for final EDM shaping and polishing before ""T2"" test shots and color test can be done.Once those are complete, we will be ready to do the first production run in early June and ship in Late June or early July.  This is not vaporware you'll wait a year for - if this Indiegogo campaign is successful, it will happen and it will happen NOW!Risk1) In the very worst case, our manufacturer botches T1-T3 test shots without providing a working device.  We have no further obligation to them, and we will walk away.  We will take your vote on whether to tool at our second manufacturer or just get your money back.2) It works, but takes some tuning.  Our manufacturer has committed to tooling this to our satisfaction.  Small tuneups may take another week or two, and a full retool will be another month.  Again, we can walk away if the device is not molded to our satisfaction in 60 days.3)The device is fully operational, but has cosmetic issues. A judgement call.  We won't accept a junky looking device, but we understand that weird molding marks or slight color mismatch is a risk in any injection molding project. We have negotiated up to 8 injection ports to minimize flow marks in the final product, and our vendor has assured us that our colors are among the easiest to produce. If the cosmetic issues are slight, we will move forward with production. If it looks terrible, we will exercise our right to walk away.
Help us Pick the Color!UPDATE: Our manufacturer has agreed to run a multiple-color run for our first batch.  Everyone will get the color they choose!  No voting necessary!
Since we can have
the device molded in any standard Pantone color, there's literally thousands to
choose from.  We're opening a vote to choose the color of the first
production run to you, our backers!  
To make it easy
for you to consider the colors, we have narrowed the list down to a set of
colors that parallel the colors of standard Lego bricks.  So if you want to
see what our green will look like, go dig in the Lego pile to find yourself a
good old green brick.  That's it.  Pantone 348C. Beautiful!
The first tier of
contributions (only 8 bucks!) is set up to get you a completed Bowslinger  and a vote for your favorite color.  We hope your color wins,
but bear in mind that you will get a Bowslinger in the final winning color,
whatever it is. 
Here's the list:
· 
Red -Pantone 032 C 
(LEGO Bright Red)
· 
Yellow -Pantone 116 C 
(LEGO Bright Yellow)
· 
Green -Pantone 348 C(LEGO Dark Green)
· 
Blue -Pantone 293 C  
(LEGO Bright Blue)
· 
Purple -Pantone 2685 C(LEGO Medium Lilac)
The online color
charts for ABS are not great, so we suggest you look at real color swatches, or
simply real LEGO bricks to see how the final color looks in ABS.  All the
color choices are quite standard with the exception of Purple - that purple is
the deep, rich purple used for the Joker in the Lego Batman sets.  Another
great color, that one.

Thanks

</div></div>","Short Summary
We make metal coins for board games, RPG, LARP, party favors, and just for fun.  This project is a reminting of our most popular items along with a few new sets, bars, and gems.  Here are the basics.

Any coin you see on this page is available in bags of 10 each so you can mix and match.
The more coins we make, the better the cost and we pass those savings onto you.
While we try to overproduce for excess inventory, there is no guarantee that these will be available on our website after the project is fulfilled in a significant quantity for all items.  It's best to get them now to secure your coinage!


What You Get

Select any coin design you see here in packs of 10.  Mix and match how you like to create a perfect gaming coin pack for your needs.
Save by getting more!  Our quantity discounts give you the ability to get these at near wholesale prices.
Domestic Orders (USA) over $300 get a wooden (pine) crate which thier coins ship in.  This crate can also serve to hold your loot!













Dwarven Small Bars:  100mm x 50mm x 4mm










Cthulhu Small Bar:  Antique Gold or Silver (same design):  60mm x 40mm x 4mm

The Impact
Your contribution helps us out tremendously!  The more we can produce, the better the cost savings and the easier it will be for our supplier.  

You get high quality metal gaming coins at an all time industry low.

Delays in production:  Our supplier has purchased 2 new machines so they can crank these babies out faster than ever before!
We will be handling all packing in our warehouse in the USA to reduce production time even more.
We can't stop a ship from sinking; however unlikely that sounds, it is still possible.  About as possible as Pirates stealing our booty!

<div>  Can you survive the aftermath of a nuclear and biological apocalypse? You are the leader of a faction of survivors competing against others for primacy. Assemble your party, assign your equipment and set out to explore the wastes, claim resources and actualize your agenda. Build and manage your town to protect your citizens and resources. You will have to make and break treaties to endure, amidst a myriad of bribery, betrayal and hubris by the other players. </div>

<p>  Fallen Land is set in the ruinous aftermath of post-apocalyptic America and is a thematic board game for 2-5 players. Featuring sandbox style game play, it combines the elements of a strategy board game with card building and role-playing. Driven by macabre stories of a world gone mad, players must adapt to the ever-changing variables: the cards, stories, interactions and threats.  Fallen Land: A Post Apocalyptic Board Game is the first of several upcoming releases for Fallen Dominion Studios. </p>

<p> In 2005, my long time friend Sean Cahill and I began designing Fallen Land: A Post-Apocalyptic Board Game. Our intent was to design a hybrid thematic game that combined the elements of a strategy board game, card game, and role-playing game. Our vision was to make it an epic event, a story driven board game that featured unlimited playability and sandbox-style game play.</p>
<p>  Fallen Land: A Post Apocalyptic Board Game is dedicated to our families. We cannot even begin to express our gratitude for their patience, help and encouragement. It is also dedicated to the many people who helped us on this long journey and to gamers everywhere. Without everyone's contributions (both big and small), this behemoth game wouldn't have been possible.  Thank you!</p>

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>Frequent communication and transparency are how we meet risks and challenges at Fallen Dominion Studios, LLC. Our supporters and fans come first and we take GREAT pride in everything we do. We are very confident that our research over the last year and a half has thoroughly prepared us for our own campaign, despite this being our first project. We believe that being an active participant ourselves in the crowdfunding community as a company is a great way to learn. As we have backed and followed other projects, we have cheered out loud at their incredible success and we have cringed as a few projects we supported and loved, failed. There are lessons to be learned at both ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>To prepare for our own campaign, we have tirelessly researched manufacturing, pricing, distribution and shipping. We have spoken to industry veterans, in all roles, from creators to manufacturers. We have also researched and read every article and blog about crowdfunding we could find, to help us succeed. In addition, books like Jamey Stegmaier's A Crowdfunder's Strategy Guide and Don Steinberg's Kickstarter Handbook, Real-Life Crowdfunding Success Stories, were invaluablel in our preparations.</p>
<p>We have also been working closely with our game manufacturer WinGo Industry, Ltd to assure that our game Fallen Land: A Post Apocalyptic Board Game will be produced at the highest quality. We are satisfied after our lengthy discussions with WinGo that their focus is on quality and getting things done right. However, if anything unforeseen does arise, rest assured we will communicate honestly and transparently with you and post frequent updates until the situation is rectified.</p>
<p>As for the delivery date, Fallen Land is 99% complete. We have self-funded the artwork, stories and designs during the game's creation. Completing this massive project proves our dedication and experience, as it took many long years to create. Its quality and value can be seen in our final product. We will however, be listening to you, our backers, and making minor adjustments after the campaign ends to reflect our supporters input. It is also possible that we will be creating new content as a result of pledge levels and stretch goals (which we are VERY excited about) and we have designed them to not delay the project. From there, we will simply need to transfer the funds and final files to WinGo for production.</p>

</div></div>","Can you survive the aftermath of a nuclear and biological apocalypse? You are the leader of a faction of survivors competing against others for primacy. Assemble your party, assign your equipment and set out to explore the wastes, claim resources and actualize your agenda. Build and manage your town to protect your citizens and resources. You will have to make and break treaties to endure, amidst a myriad of bribery, betrayal and hubris by the other players. 
 
  Fallen Land is set in the ruinous aftermath of post-apocalyptic America and is a thematic board game for 2-5 players. Featuring sandbox style game play, it combines the elements of a strategy board game with card building and role-playing. Driven by macabre stories of a world gone mad, players must adapt to the ever-changing variables: the cards, stories, interactions and threats.  Fallen Land: A Post Apocalyptic Board Game is the first of several upcoming releases for Fallen Dominion Studios.

  Fallen Dominion Studios strives to create exceptional board games. Games people will want to play over and over again. We take great pride in meticulously crafting every aspect of our games, from their eye-popping artwork to their pulp storytelling, innovative designs and multi-level strategy content. Since 2005, we have been burning the midnight oil to create and produce Fallen Land: A Post-Apocalyptic Board Game. Slotted as the first of several upcoming releases for our studio, it is over eleven years in the making.
  In the future, our gaming system and our upcoming titles will span across a multitude of different genres. They too will feature interchangeable aspects and unlimited playability. Combining aspects from multiple games will allow players to customize their gaming experience to best fit their interests and play styles.
  For now however, we simply hope you have the opportunity to play Fallen Land. Adventure and intrigue await! On behalf of everyone at Fallen Dominion Studios, I hope you enjoy playing our game as much as we have enjoyed creating it for you.
~Cheers,
Jon Lonngren

Risks and challenges
Frequent communication and transparency are how we meet risks and challenges at Fallen Dominion Studios, LLC. Our supporters and fans come first and we take GREAT pride in everything we do. We are very confident that our research over the last year and a half has thoroughly prepared us for our own campaign, despite this being our first project. We believe that being an active participant ourselves in the crowdfunding community as a company is a great way to learn. As we have backed and followed other projects, we have cheered out loud at their incredible success and we have cringed as a few projects we supported and loved, failed. There are lessons to be learned at both ends of the spectrum.
To prepare for our own campaign, we have tirelessly researched manufacturing, pricing, distribution and shipping. We have spoken to industry veterans, in all roles, from creators to manufacturers. We have also researched and read every article and blog about crowdfunding we could find, to help us succeed. In addition, books like Jamey Stegmaier's A Crowdfunder's Strategy Guide and Don Steinberg's Kickstarter Handbook, Real-Life Crowdfunding Success Stories, were invaluablel in our preparations.
We have also been working closely with our game manufacturer WinGo Industry, Ltd to assure that our game Fallen Land: A Post Apocalyptic Board Game will be produced at the highest quality. We are satisfied after our lengthy discussions with WinGo that their focus is on quality and getting things done right. However, if anything unforeseen does arise, rest assured we will communicate honestly and transparently with you and post frequent updates until the situation is rectified.
As for the delivery date, Fallen Land is 99% complete. We have self-funded the artwork, stories and designs during the game's creation. Completing this massive project proves our dedication and experience, as it took many long years to create. Its quality and value can be seen in our final product. We will however, be listening to you, our backers, and making minor adjustments after the campaign ends to reflect our supporters input. It is also possible that we will be creating new content as a result of pledge levels and stretch goals (which we are VERY excited about) and we have designed them to not delay the project. From there, we will simply need to transfer the funds and final files to WinGo for production.",23.0,3,"1 Campaign

<em><strong>Genesis</strong></em> is dealt like blackjack, but the similarities end there because the game has all new features and an entirely new fun and strategic scoring system.

<h3></h3>
</div><p><b>About us</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Meiko Miniatures is a small company producing miniatures for Fantasy
Football. We offer alternative designs to the ones existing and we provide the
players with a wide variety of miniatures to help them complete their teams. To
achieve this we always work with the most talented sculptors.</p>
<p align=""justify"">You can see here our previous 4 Meiko Indiegogo campaigns:
Lizardmen, Kaos Dwarves, Ratmen and Undead / Necromantic. <b>All the packages of these four campaigns were shipped just 3 months
after the end of each campaign</b>, accomplishing the estimated shipping dates
stated on the campaign descriptions:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniatures-lizardmen-fantasy-football-team"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniatures-lizardmen-fantasy-football-team</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniature-s-ratmen-fantasy-football-team/x/2362463#home"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniature-s-ratmen-fantasy-football-team</span></a></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-s-undead-necromantic-fantasy-football-team"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-s-undead-necromantic-fantasy-football-team</span></a></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">The Meiko <span>Miniatures new project is the <b>Ultimate Kaos Pact Team</b>. The Kaos Pact
Team will include the following 15 Players: 1 Mutated Ogre, 1 Mutated Troll, 1
Mutated Minotaur, 1 Dark Elf Renegade, 1 Ratmen Renegade, 1 Goblin Renegade, 5
Marauders with no Mutation and 4 Mutated Marauders (Two Heads, Extra Arm, Claws
and Big Hand). The campaign will also include 3 Star Players that can play with
the Kaos Team, two Mutation Sprues (one for miniatures of standard size and the
other one for Big Guys) and several more items: two Kaos Pact Pitches
(Puzzle-like Hard Pitch and Rollable Plastic Gaming Pitch), </span><span>Mutated Football,</span> racial Range Ruler, a Marauder Coach / Referee, Block
Dice and three Skill Dice very useful to play with this team (Animosity Dice
for the Renegade players, Bone Head for the Ogre and Always Hungry for the
Troll).</p>
<p align=""justify"">The sculpting of most of these miniatures has already
been made. Only two of the Star Players need to be sculpted. But we need your
help to speed up the casting process. That way, we will be able to release the
Meiko Kaos Pact Team much sooner than what was initially planned. Using
Indiegogo as a platform to rise funds helps us a lot since we can finance new
miniatures and other interesting items, obtain feedback from our customers and
it gives us confidence to keep working on. In exchange you will get some
cool rewards.</p>
<p align=""justify"">All the miniatures will be casted in metal, including
the <span>Mutated Football</span>. The master moulds will be made by Miniaturas
Alemany, the mouldmaker of other successful Fantasy Football Indiegogo
campaigns like the Willy Chaos Team and the Willy Amazon Team. </p>
<p align=""justify""><b>The sculptor of all the miniatures of this team is Franarcilla</b>, the skilled
sculptor of many other Meiko teams like the Kaos Dwarf, Undead, Necromantic,
Ogre, Goblin, Rotter, Orc and Wood Elf Teams, just to mention some of them.
Franarcilla is one of Meiko Miniatures flagship sculptors. His dark sculpting
style specially fits with all the chaotic races, and his Kaos Pact minis will
fit with the image we all have in mind when we think about this team. We
specially like the “gladiator” look that he gave to the Marauders.

Meiko Miniatures is a small company producing miniatures for Fantasy
Football. We offer alternative designs to the ones existing and we provide the
players with a wide variety of miniatures to help them complete their teams. To
achieve this we always work with the most talented sculptors.
You can see here our previous 4 Meiko Indiegogo campaigns:
Lizardmen, Kaos Dwarves, Ratmen and Undead / Necromantic. All the packages of these four campaigns were shipped just 3 months
after the end of each campaign, accomplishing the estimated shipping dates
stated on the campaign descriptions:

https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-s-undead-necromantic-fantasy-football-team

Why crowdfunding?
The Meiko Miniatures new project is the Ultimate Kaos Pact Team. The Kaos Pact
Team will include the following 15 Players: 1 Mutated Ogre, 1 Mutated Troll, 1
Mutated Minotaur, 1 Dark Elf Renegade, 1 Ratmen Renegade, 1 Goblin Renegade, 5
Marauders with no Mutation and 4 Mutated Marauders (Two Heads, Extra Arm, Claws
and Big Hand). The campaign will also include 3 Star Players that can play with
the Kaos Team, two Mutation Sprues (one for miniatures of standard size and the
other one for Big Guys) and several more items: two Kaos Pact Pitches
(Puzzle-like Hard Pitch and Rollable Plastic Gaming Pitch), Mutated Football, racial Range Ruler, a Marauder Coach / Referee, Block
Dice and three Skill Dice very useful to play with this team (Animosity Dice
for the Renegade players, Bone Head for the Ogre and Always Hungry for the
Troll).
The sculpting of most of these miniatures has already
been made. Only two of the Star Players need to be sculpted. But we need your
help to speed up the casting process. That way, we will be able to release the
Meiko Kaos Pact Team much sooner than what was initially planned. Using
Indiegogo as a platform to rise funds helps us a lot since we can finance new
miniatures and other interesting items, obtain feedback from our customers and
it gives us confidence to keep working on. In exchange you will get some
cool rewards.
All the miniatures will be casted in metal, including
the Mutated Football. The master moulds will be made by Miniaturas
Alemany, the mouldmaker of other successful Fantasy Football Indiegogo
campaigns like the Willy Chaos Team and the Willy Amazon Team. 
The sculptor of all the miniatures of this team is Franarcilla, the skilled
sculptor of many other Meiko teams like the Kaos Dwarf, Undead, Necromantic,
Ogre, Goblin, Rotter, Orc and Wood Elf Teams, just to mention some of them.
Franarcilla is one of Meiko Miniatures flagship sculptors. His dark sculpting
style specially fits with all the chaotic races, and his Kaos Pact minis will
fit with the image we all have in mind when we think about this team. We
specially like the “gladiator” look that he gave to the Marauders.
Currently, Franarcilla is considered by many Fantasy Football fans as one of
the best and most talented Fantasy Football sculptors worldwide.

					Hello my name is Lenny Raposo and I am the sole developer of Star Trek Universe RPG.<br/><br/>

					I have been developing this game in my spare time for the past 3 years with the hopes of delivering a game to all fans of everything Trek that can be easily played from a browser without the need of a client package.<br/><br/>

					My goal is to build a game engine for the space/strategy genre that puts the player in full control of their ship in a realtime 2d environment while playing with or against others. Players will get to fly their ships through the galaxy, trade, hunt, defend, spy, build, conquer and much more.

					I am a 35 year old I.T. consultant from Toronto, Canada with over 15 years experience in graphic &amp; web design, programming (PHP, Python, C++, Javascript &amp; HTML), database administration (MySQL, PostgreSQL &amp; MS SQL) and networking (Windows, Unix, Linux &amp; Mac). I am also the proud father of four children and husband to an ever supporting wife.<br/><br/>

					Being a family man it has been difficult to devote myself fulltime to a project of this magnitude without resorting to turning down work, which is literally an impossibility when you have a family to support,<br/><br/><b style=""margin-left: 175px;""><i>until now...</i></b>

					A majority of the funding will be going towards my living expenses as I will be devoting my time fully in developing the game and not tending to or accepting work contracts during this time.<br/><br/>

					As I have been working on this project for the past 3 years I have been able to procure a number of items for the cause.

					<ul>
<li>Uninterruptable Power Supply<br/>550 Watts/1100 VA</li>
<li>Loadbalancers<br/>2x Pentium Dual Core Systems With 1GB RAM</li>
<li>Webservers<br/>3x Pentium Dual Core Systems With 2GB RAM</li>
<li>Database Servers<br/>2x AMD Quad Cores With 4GB RAM</li>
</ul>

					All systems have been configured with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server clustered with failover/loadbalancing to ensure maximum up time. I will also be adding the ability to host Alliance/Clan pages (with subdomains @ universerpg.com) along with open up an IRC server that is dedicated for the game, but there are a few things that I do require in order to have the game run smoother.

					I am reaching out to the community in hopes of giving me the opportunity to finish what I started.<br/><br/>

					A lot of the ground work has been laid down and if I am able to acquire the minimum funding goal of $8,000.00 I can have a minimalistic (see goal marks below for details) game up and running within 4 to 5 months. At this level it will be enjoyable but it will be without a number of bells and whistles.<br/><br/>

					Of course the ultimate goal would be to reach the full target of $20,000.00 as this will provide the greatest Trek gaming experience (ETA 10 to 12 months).

				This is the minimum I require to complete my game engine with the basic gameplay elements. It will not be a sophisticated game at this level but it will give fans a taste of what it can be made to do if fully funded.<br/><br/>
				Below you will find the list of features the game will have, keep in mind that a majority of the ground work has been done and only requires some polishing or very little to be completed.<br/><br/>
				For those of you that have contributed at the Admiral Level you will get to check out the game development as it happens with your access to the Dev server.

WELCOME ABOARD


				Hello and welcome to the Indiegogo's home for Star Trek Universe RPG.

				Star Trek Universe RPG is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) from Universe RPG Productions. Players can become a starship captain in the various factions, or form an independent alliance within the Star Trek universe all within your browser.

				Explore strange new worlds, open up trade routes, become a politician and protect your respective territory alone or with others in the vastness of space.

				Decisions in game can lead to various outcomes that can influence the entire universe as a whole. Your actions can range from the destruction of starships to the downfall of entire factions. Every action taken by every player affects the state of the universe, and through those actions affect other players in the game.
			








ABOUT THE PROJECT

					Hello my name is Lenny Raposo and I am the sole developer of Star Trek Universe RPG.

					I have been developing this game in my spare time for the past 3 years with the hopes of delivering a game to all fans of everything Trek that can be easily played from a browser without the need of a client package.

					My goal is to build a game engine for the space/strategy genre that puts the player in full control of their ship in a realtime 2d environment while playing with or against others. Players will get to fly their ships through the galaxy, trade, hunt, defend, spy, build, conquer and much more.

					



ABOUT THE DEVELOPER

					I am a 35 year old I.T. consultant from Toronto, Canada with over 15 years experience in graphic & web design, programming (PHP, Python, C++, Javascript & HTML), database administration (MySQL, PostgreSQL & MS SQL) and networking (Windows, Unix, Linux & Mac). I am also the proud father of four children and husband to an ever supporting wife.

					Being a family man it has been difficult to devote myself fulltime to a project of this magnitude without resorting to turning down work, which is literally an impossibility when you have a family to support,until now...



WHAT YOU ARE FUNDING

					A majority of the funding will be going towards my living expenses as I will be devoting my time fully in developing the game and not tending to or accepting work contracts during this time.

					As I have been working on this project for the past 3 years I have been able to procure a number of items for the cause.

					
Uninterruptable Power Supply550 Watts/1100 VA
Loadbalancers2x Pentium Dual Core Systems With 1GB RAM
Webservers3x Pentium Dual Core Systems With 2GB RAM
Database Servers2x AMD Quad Cores With 4GB RAM


					All systems have been configured with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server clustered with failover/loadbalancing to ensure maximum up time. I will also be adding the ability to host Alliance/Clan pages (with subdomains @ universerpg.com) along with open up an IRC server that is dedicated for the game, but there are a few things that I do require in order to have the game run smoother.

					
1x 8 Core System With16GB RAM & 1TB HD ...$600.00

2x 8 Port GBit Switches ...$150.00

2x UPS @ 550 Watts ...$250.00

Estimated Total ...$1000.00





WHAT'S NEEDED

					I am reaching out to the community in hopes of giving me the opportunity to finish what I started.

					A lot of the ground work has been laid down and if I am able to acquire the minimum funding goal of $8,000.00 I can have a minimalistic (see goal marks below for details) game up and running within 4 to 5 months. At this level it will be enjoyable but it will be without a number of bells and whistles.

					Of course the ultimate goal would be to reach the full target of $20,000.00 as this will provide the greatest Trek gaming experience (ETA 10 to 12 months).
				





$8,000.00 MARK


				This is the minimum I require to complete my game engine with the basic gameplay elements. It will not be a sophisticated game at this level but it will give fans a taste of what it can be made to do if fully funded.
				Below you will find the list of features the game will have, keep in mind that a majority of the ground work has been done and only requires some polishing or very little to be completed.
				For those of you that have contributed at the Admiral Level you will get to check out the game development as it happens with your access to the Dev server.

Overview
White Ravens is very happy to present Sweet Sabotage! This is an upcoming board game designed by Filipino Game Designer, Charles Cue!

<h3>Hi! We're two people who share a passion for all things bicycle.</h3>
<p>We've been living in Bicycle City, USA, for 25 collective years (Shawn 10 and April 15).  In that time we've soaked up a lot of what makes Portland a unique place.  We've also logged in thousands of miles of traveling by bike around the Northwest.  Now we want to go to the next level.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We want to explore both the United States and Canada by the saddles of our bicycles.  An adventure like this is ambitious enough in its own right.  But we don't want to just ride thousands of miles, see some sights, and take some photos.  We want to see what's going on in other cities and towns in regards to bicycling.  A lot has happened over the last decade or so. Scenes have popped up in towns small and large.  Bike lanes are being striped.  The number of cyclists is going up and up. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There are a lot of factors going into this Bicycle Renaissance but we want to concentrate on the human factor--the people who are making a difference in their own way. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">We want to see what kinds of cool stuff other cities are doing, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">like fun rides or other events.</span> We want to seek out and talk to those people.  The blogger. The zine writer. The person who started up a weekly or monthly ride.  The folks who run the community bicycle shop. The advocates and activists.  The bicycle artists and crafters.  And the people who just love bicycles. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We're taking the road on May 25 and don't plan to be home until November.  In the five months we'll be riding, we'll slowly head eastward from Portland with the ultimate goal of Halifax, Nova Scotia.  Along the way we'll hit up national parks like North Cascades, Glacier, Waterton Lakes, Banff, and Jasper, and cities as diverse as Seattle, Vancouver, Spokane, Missoula, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Regina, Winnipeg, Fargo, Duluth, Minneapolis, Iowa City, Chicago, Fort Wayne, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, New Haven, Boston, Burlington, Montreal, and Quebec City.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We'll be writing about our adventures through our respective blogs, <a href=""http://urbanadventureleague.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://urbanadventureleague.blogspot.com/</a> (Shawn) and <a href=""http://aprillikesbikes.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://aprillikesbikes.wordpress.com/</a> (April).  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>But ultimately we want to collect our adventures into a book!  A book, you say?  Rest assured, we're not novices to publishing.  Shawn has been involved in mini-comics and zines for 15 years, self publishing the comic Ten Foot Rule and editing the Zinester's Guide To Portland, published by Microcosm Publishing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A lot has been made about the Bicycle Renaissance, but much of it has focused on ""numbers""--amount of people bicycle commuting, number and length of bike lanes, etc.  We want to bring attention to the less tangible aspects.  We also want to shine a light on the people making it happen in less conspicuous ways.  One does not have to be a policy wonk to make a difference.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>By sharing our experiences through the web and a book we hope to inspire others to ""do something"".  We want to show folks that they aren't alone out there.  We want to show folks that bicycle touring is a fun thing to do, and while our tour is definitely on the ""ambitious"" side, anyone can do a tour if they have the right mindset. We also want to show people that they can start bike fun in their own towns.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're frugal folks and have experience living on little.  We're going to do this trip no matter what, but any and all donations will help us on the road.  We're looking at being on the road for up to five months so money is definitely important.  The money we'll get will be used towards the expenses on the road--food, lodging, transit beyond bicycles when needed, and bicycle repairs and maintenance.  What we have left over if any will help us with the publishing aspect of this project.</p>

KOOR COLLECTION! 
We
specialise in handmade recycled furniture. We custom build and also sell KOOR
originals. 
The KOOR
team is made up of long time friends Kiz and Nat. This year we turned our
passion for interiors and quality made furniture from hobby to the real deal
and launched our business. 
This
September we have the privilege of living out our other passion and will head
to Alto, Peru on a volunteer building aid mission trip with MISFIT AID
AUSTRALIA.
What We Need & What You Get
Your contributions
will go directly to purchasing the locally sourced building materials we will
be using on the various projects planned for the trip including new roofs for
10 families in the area. In return, we have the following PERKS.

A donation of $20 or more puts you in the draw to win a
     KOOR custom piece of furniture of your own
1st prize to the value of $500
2nd prize to the value $200
To increase your chances to win simply donate more
     coin! 
$40 will see your name in the draw 2 times, $50 3 times
     and donations of $100 or more 10 times!!
This perk is for Sydney residents only due logistical
     reasons (shipping etc) but don't let this stop you from donating anyway!
Winners will be drawn and notified at the conclusion of
     our campaign
We will then meet with you to design and create your
     dream custom piece of furniture.

The Impact
This is the second trip to
the community headed by Misfit Aid
trip the first being in September 2013. Nat was privileged enough to go on this
trip and has been itching to get back ever since.

The primary objective of this trip, is to
     re-construct/repair the roofing of 10 households throughout the community,
     currently deemed uninhabitable.
LAN Airways have sponsored our flights, so donors can be assured that all funds
     contributed will go directly to the purchased of building materials

<p>The basic prototyping is done. The criticall systems are tested, such as ship generation, building, local gravity, collisions, physics, multiplayer, general perfomance and gameplay. Everything works, and biggest challenges are behind. </p>
<p>I took a good rest after presentation was done and before my credit card has been issued and I could launch the camaign. Now I will step back and build a robust class structure before adding new features into the game. I'll keep you posted on the progress.</p>
<p><b>The trailer and screenshots are featuring testing of the prototype version of the game. Pretty much everything will look and work better in later versions. For example ships will have shields and weapons will not destroy blocks so easily. There will be much more different kinds of blocks and decorative pannels. The lighting system will be different. The players, weapons and doors will have propper voxel models. Shadows will work.

<p>Even if I get just 3000$, the campaign will be a minor succes for me. In about six month this game should reach some early playable state or at least look more like it suppose to, and I will be able to get an additional funding if needed. 3000$ for 6 month is 25% below average wage in my region, It is absolutely enough, at the moment.</p>

<p><span>Gamentio - an online multiplayer 3D casino gaming portal - has the capacity to be the next big thing in the world of gaming. And here is why we say so:</span></p>
<br/><h3>A great deal of features:</h3>
<b>3D Card Games:</b> Unlike the numerous online games floating in the market, we are offering Social card games in 3D. We are ready with the Web version of Poker, Rummy and Flush. Given the huge contrast of look and feel between a 2D game and Gamentio, we are sure that players will love the refreshing change that Gamentio has to offer.<br/><p></p>

<p><b>The normal sucky 2D interface v/s The All-powerful 3D-experience of Gamentio</b></p>
<p><b>Real Life Experience:</b> The USP of Gamentio is that the Avatars have the capability of imitating the player’s actions. On the command of the players, Avatars can wave a Hi to their opponents, or convey their joy by raising the hands, punching the air, they can also do a little victory dance routine at a win! Gamentio is the only online Card game that allows its players the chance to express themselves just like they would do in a real life card game.<br/></p>

<br/><b>3D Avatars:</b> To take the gaming experience up a notch, we have designed 3D models who can be customized to become a player’s Avatar. So, whether a player decides to play as a rowdy cowboy or as a sharp businessman, we have all the options. A player can choose from our 10 male and 10 female 3D models and customize to be whatever they want to be.<span style=""background-color: initial;"">  </span>

<p>Gamentio is the proud dream and ambitious product of <a href=""http://logicsimplified.com/M/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Logic Simplified</a>, that is us. We are a team of 20 gaming enthusiasts, designers and developers from Dehradun, a beautiful tier-2 city of India. We have delivered over 10 games to clients from across the globe, and are now all set to enter the gaming world with our very own online gaming platform - Gamentio.</p>

<br/>
<br/><p>It all began 3 years ago with a team of three members , lead by Sumeet Arora, the founder of Logic Simplified Pvt. Ltd. Sumeet who has also published a book, <b>WebGL Game Development</b> (Get your copy <a href=""http://www.amazon.in/WebGL-Game-Development-Sumeet-Arora/dp/1849699798"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a>). He visualized the entire future of Gamentio. From the initial stages of the project, Sumeet knew exactly what he wanted, where he wanted it, and how he wanted it to be<b>.  </b>To connect and know about Sumeet feel free to visit his profile on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=ADEAAAVRqzUBBGe3odT7CglDySYMgh4DzhXXqPs&amp;authType=OPENLINK&amp;authToken=7yym&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=4009417801445411333933&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=83&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A4009417801445411333933%2CVSRPtargetId%3A89238325%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary%2CVSRPnm%3Atrue%2CauthType%3AOPENLINK"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIN</a><br/></p>
<p>We had few resources, but the dream to build something of our own kept us going through. Team started growing with professionals who are head over heels in love with card games (even hired an expert with 10,000 hours spread over 11 years of online card game-play experience!), and with designers and developers who deeply believe in our idea, Gamentio started taking shape. Since then, we have come a long way, and are now climbing the final few steps towards a grand launch. </p>
<p><b>What’s MORE to do?</b></p>
<br/><p><img alt=""construction.png"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/T0vEgI2YHN82wBvYxZ6liWQh6R6oh4rk9QjwH7ifKSgKHfat4oDOjVxL3x835dUeVo5TeL1Yfbo1bOvB6ZvVNR9ifPrY2guHAsIqUmKmBhOlEeyavtj8nV137C650-IN9FrvLhUY"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Although the Web &amp; iOS versions of the game are ready, we still have a list of things that are to be done to ensure that the game is as awesome as we want it to be. So, here is what we are planning to do:<b> <br/></b></p>
<p><b>1. MORE availability: </b>After the web &amp; iOS versions, our plan is to focus on the Android version of Gamentio. Since the world is already past the mobile Tipping Point according to this <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/majority-of-digital-media-consumption-now-takes-place-in-mobile-apps/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">report</a> (from comScore), we want to accelerate the development of Android version of the game so that we can reach a wider user base sooner than later while making Gamentio more accessible and on-the-go.<b> <br/></b></p>
<p><b>2. MORE features: </b>A range of 3D rooms with different ambiances and moods, a wide collection of clothes, more vivid avatars, variety of expressions and gestures, etc. We want to integrate all these features to make Gamentio launch ready.</p>
<p><img alt=""AvatarScreen1.jpg"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OnU8o8Rzn7sdte1EfeyFVNW_DuAbnBnFgoUuPi5MQCq3vEFTyugrT_x3cfyJOYuKlYC42nsBW4pOmRgHMxxbI0M8gpc-q5h8o-8eZIA__dvHSuPXzbrCdv2xSpTrOmOuU-hb734"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>3. MORE games:</b> Gamentio is a platform where we will be adding more and more games in the coming times. Blackjack, Baccarat, Casino Wars, Slots and Roulette are some of the top of the list names that we want to add. We have successfully architected Gamentio in such a way that we can now launch any card game in less than a month’s time. Every popular casino card game will find its way into Gamentio eventually. </p>

<p><b>4. MORE stunning:</b> Among other things, integrated-voice-command facility is one feature that we are currently working on. Once done, the game will be monitored and controlled by over 500 voice commands.</p>

<p><b>5. MORE Aggression:</b> Show your mettle! We understand the need of a competitive edge that drives a card game. Our regular tournaments will give the players the opportunity to compete with other players across the world, score points, win attractive prizes and climb up the leaderboard. We will make it as interactive and exciting as a real casino.</p>
<p><b>6. MORE real than ever:</b> Learn from the Pros. We also intend to invite the top professional Poker players to play in our featured main event tournaments. Watch them play, cheer your favorites, learn from their tactics. Make the most of it.</p>
<p><b>7. MORE rigorous testing:</b> To ascertain that you have an extremely delightful experience with us, our team of developers and testers will be leaving no stone unturned during the testing and trials. Our goal is to deliver a smooth, flawless, memorable online gaming experience to the players.</p>

<p><b>Why we need your support?</b></p>
<p>To achieve all the goals listed above, we need resources and funds. After three years of efforts and utilizing whatever resources we had, we have run out of funds to carry our dream any further. <b>As of now, we were working on the project on a part-time basis; majorly working on weekends and holidays.</b> Once we get a considerable amount of funding, we will be able to allocate dedicated resources to Project Gamentio, and deliver higher standards of quality and quantity within the decided time frame.</p>
<p>That is why we need the support from you guys. Given below is how we are planning to proceed  and how your help can make a difference for us.</p>
<p><b>Where will the funding be utilized?</b></p>
<p>Our team will comprise of Four Designers, Four Developers (One back-end and three front-end), Three Testers (who will also be taking care of the marketing) and One Project Manager to lead the team and ensure that goals are met within the decided timeline. Additional to that will be the testing devices, server cost, salaries, etc. Taking all the expenses and costs into consideration, we are looking for USD 100,000 crowd sourced funding to enable us to turn our efforts into a reality.</p>
<br/><p><img alt=""image.png"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oBvUyDA8LvhsxGcNBJkzcp6BkJZG93so7_xHQTFk3ncnt3dnjxI2iAP2qfQoA2gN3BNERDQpjvtrXOGWr-d1DsoR5mli4xy3I4DVww2Sp_RFeN-LZ8iigRUrkJIU3zTnNmpOrT-1"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>With your backing &amp; support, if we surpass our goal of $100,000, we will be utilizing <b>that</b> funding in the development of new social games as mentioned in Point 3 above. So, the number of games we make &amp; add to Gamentio will be dependent on the contribution we get over and above our targeted goal.<br/><br/><p>We firmly believe that your support will help us to keep our work running and reach our goals very soon. </p>
<p>With our passion and your support, we are confident that we will be able to acquire 10% of the total market share of Social games by 2019. </p>
<p>Needless to say, we will keep you posted on all our updates and achievements over the coming few months. You will know exactly where your funds are been utilized, and how your support is helping us achieve our goals.</p>

<p>Team Gamentio</p>
</div></div>","Gamentio, a product of Logic Simplified, aspires to disrupt the Social Casino (Non-Gambling) scene by introducing the concept of online 3D, so as to bring the online gaming experience closer to a real experience. This is achieved by enabling players to choose customizable 3D Avatars equipped with command-based gestures & expressions (joy, frustration, applause etc), in a 3D setting that looks & feels as if one is playing in a land-based casino.



Please note that Gamentio is purely entertainment-oriented where players can play using virtual money. Gamentio doesn't support or encourage gambling.Please go ahead and try our games at gamentio.com - choose your Avatar and play your favorite card game (Currently only on Desktop).
Our WorkWe have transformed social card games from non-vibrant 2D environments to most scintillating, emotion-packed 3D card games, where each player expresses his emotions through his avatar. Our evolution is similar to Counter Strike from Contra in card games.Our Dream is big & Crowdfunding is the best place where we get opinions and funds. You can try our Avatars and animations in our card games online (no downloads required). Please try our games & send us your opinion - It will make a world of difference (pun intended!)We have designed around 20 Avatars and  launched three 3D Card Games - Poker, Rummy & Teen Patti (also known as Flush or Flash)- Social card games you can play with your family. In the first year, we will do only card games and the build more social games.With your financial support, we expect to be one of the world’s best 3D multiplayer social gaming company.Who We AreWe are a team of Game Developers & Artists from a small town Dehradun in India.What we have done so farWe have achieved most of it at the development front! Try gamentio.com to check our alpha web version and please share your valuable suggestions.Note: It’s still in Alpha stage so please bear with the bugs for now.Our online multiplayer 3D social gaming portal is ready with its Web and iOS versions of these 3D card games: Poker, Rummy and Flush (Teen Patti). Beside this, the development of other 3D card games - Blackjack, Baccarat and Casino Wars is underway.As much as all of the above games may sound familiar to you but what we have tried to develop is a complete re-invention of what already exists. Our game offers you the luxury of playing a game of cards with your friend who sits half way across the world and you can still relish the fun & excitement of an enthralling card game, like you are playing on a table together! You can now express yourself in an online card game by a mere click. Or how about a victory dance through your avatar after beating a higher ranking player!Presenting to you, ladies and gentlemen and all the crazy card game lovers out there - GAMENTIO





Gamentio - an online multiplayer 3D casino gaming portal - has the capacity to be the next big thing in the world of gaming. And here is why we say so:
A great deal of features:
3D Card Games: Unlike the numerous online games floating in the market, we are offering Social card games in 3D. We are ready with the Web version of Poker, Rummy and Flush. Given the huge contrast of look and feel between a 2D game and Gamentio, we are sure that players will love the refreshing change that Gamentio has to offer.

The normal sucky 2D interface v/s The All-powerful 3D-experience of Gamentio
Real Life Experience: The USP of Gamentio is that the Avatars have the capability of imitating the player’s actions. On the command of the players, Avatars can wave a Hi to their opponents, or convey their joy by raising the hands, punching the air, they can also do a little victory dance routine at a win! Gamentio is the only online Card game that allows its players the chance to express themselves just like they would do in a real life card game.



3D Avatars: To take the gaming experience up a notch, we have designed 3D models who can be customized to become a player’s Avatar. So, whether a player decides to play as a rowdy cowboy or as a sharp businessman, we have all the options. A player can choose from our 10 male and 10 female 3D models and customize to be whatever they want to be.  


Socialize: A range of interactive options are provided by us. Players can revel in the fun and indulge in features like private messaging, blogs, invites, real time activity feed, comment & like favorite posts and do much more! With players growing in numbers, very soon Gamentio will have it’s very own gaming community.


3D Room and Private Gaming: The 3D room, where the game is set, enables the players to toy with the camera angles, choose seats, etc. Players can even create a private room and go on a gaming marathon with their friends.




Ranking & Leaderboard: With our easy to follow Leaderboard, players can check out their current rankings and keep an eagle eye on the current leader and rank.


Pure Entertainment: The sole purpose of Gamentio is to provide hours and hours of entertainment to its players. No gambling quotient involved - just easy, hassle free, electrifying fun and entertainment.
Easy Payment Options: Never run out of chips with our easy mobile and SMS payment options. Players can also make in-game payments to unlock the exquisite wardrobe of the Avatars and activate the voice-commands-integrated version of the game.
No Registration Fees: What’s more, Gamentio is absolutely hassle free!! Players can visit the website to play the Web version of the game, register themselves and start playing! No installation, no registration fees whatsoever! A simple login will take the players into the  world of 3D card gaming paradise!


So why the campaign, you ask?
Gamentio is the proud dream and ambitious product of Logic Simplified, that is us. We are a team of 20 gaming enthusiasts, designers and developers from Dehradun, a beautiful tier-2 city of India. We have delivered over 10 games to clients from across the globe, and are now all set to enter the gaming world with our very own online gaming platform - Gamentio.





It all began 3 years ago with a team of three members , lead by Sumeet Arora, the founder of Logic Simplified Pvt. Ltd. Sumeet who has also published a book, WebGL Game Development (Get your copy HERE). He visualized the entire future of Gamentio. From the initial stages of the project, Sumeet knew exactly what he wanted, where he wanted it, and how he wanted it to be.  To connect and know about Sumeet feel free to visit his profile on LinkedIN
We had few resources, but the dream to build something of our own kept us going through. Team started growing with professionals who are head over heels in love with card games (even hired an expert with 10,000 hours spread over 11 years of online card game-play experience!), and with designers and developers who deeply believe in our idea, Gamentio started taking shape. Since then, we have come a long way, and are now climbing the final few steps towards a grand launch. 
What’s MORE to do?

Although the Web & iOS versions of the game are ready, we still have a list of things that are to be done to ensure that the game is as awesome as we want it to be. So, here is what we are planning to do: 
1. MORE availability: After the web & iOS versions, our plan is to focus on the Android version of Gamentio. Since the world is already past the mobile Tipping Point according to this report (from comScore), we want to accelerate the development of Android version of the game so that we can reach a wider user base sooner than later while making Gamentio more accessible and on-the-go. 
2. MORE features: A range of 3D rooms with different ambiances and moods, a wide collection of clothes, more vivid avatars, variety of expressions and gestures, etc. We want to integrate all these features to make Gamentio launch ready.


3. MORE games: Gamentio is a platform where we will be adding more and more games in the coming times. Blackjack, Baccarat, Casino Wars, Slots and Roulette are some of the top of the list names that we want to add. We have successfully architected Gamentio in such a way that we can now launch any card game in less than a month’s time. Every popular casino card game will find its way into Gamentio eventually. 

4. MORE stunning: Among other things, integrated-voice-command facility is one feature that we are currently working on. Once done, the game will be monitored and controlled by over 500 voice commands.

5. MORE Aggression: Show your mettle! We understand the need of a competitive edge that drives a card game. Our regular tournaments will give the players the opportunity to compete with other players across the world, score points, win attractive prizes and climb up the leaderboard. We will make it as interactive and exciting as a real casino.
6. MORE real than ever: Learn from the Pros. We also intend to invite the top professional Poker players to play in our featured main event tournaments. Watch them play, cheer your favorites, learn from their tactics. Make the most of it.
7. MORE rigorous testing: To ascertain that you have an extremely delightful experience with us, our team of developers and testers will be leaving no stone unturned during the testing and trials. Our goal is to deliver a smooth, flawless, memorable online gaming experience to the players.

Why we need your support?
To achieve all the goals listed above, we need resources and funds. After three years of efforts and utilizing whatever resources we had, we have run out of funds to carry our dream any further. As of now, we were working on the project on a part-time basis; majorly working on weekends and holidays. Once we get a considerable amount of funding, we will be able to allocate dedicated resources to Project Gamentio, and deliver higher standards of quality and quantity within the decided time frame.
That is why we need the support from you guys. Given below is how we are planning to proceed  and how your help can make a difference for us.
Where will the funding be utilized?
Our team will comprise of Four Designers, Four Developers (One back-end and three front-end), Three Testers (who will also be taking care of the marketing) and One Project Manager to lead the team and ensure that goals are met within the decided timeline. Additional to that will be the testing devices, server cost, salaries, etc. Taking all the expenses and costs into consideration, we are looking for USD 100,000 crowd sourced funding to enable us to turn our efforts into a reality.

With your backing & support, if we surpass our goal of $100,000, we will be utilizing that funding in the development of new social games as mentioned in Point 3 above. So, the number of games we make & add to Gamentio will be dependent on the contribution we get over and above our targeted goal.We firmly believe that your support will help us to keep our work running and reach our goals very soon. 
With our passion and your support, we are confident that we will be able to acquire 10% of the total market share of Social games by 2019. 
Needless to say, we will keep you posted on all our updates and achievements over the coming few months. You will know exactly where your funds are been utilized, and how your support is helping us achieve our goals.

<h3>What's our project?</h3>
<p>We're making a spot the difference game for iOS called ""Splat the Difference"".</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.splatthedifference.com/images/splat_logo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In case you didn't immediately figure it out, the gameplay is styled so that you mark differences on a picture using coloured ""splats"".</p>
<p>Imagine throwing jelly at a window to solve a puzzle.</p>
<p>Wasn't that fun?</p>
<p>Plus, you can play against a friend, live and in real-time over the internet!</p>
<h3>Who are we? </h3>
<p>Lightwood Games is a small, independent developer who has produced a number of puzzle games for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.</p>
<p>We're passionate about social gaming experiences, so our titles include multi-player online modes. We created the first ever online competitive word search puzzle (<a href=""http://www.lightwoodgames.com/get/word-search-party"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Word Search Party</a>), which has now been played more than 10 million times.  We made a jigsaw app (<a href=""http://www.lightwoodgames.com/get/jigsaw-party"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jigsaw Party</a>) that lets you create puzzles from your own photos and then race to solve them against a friend in real time.  Our sudoku game (<a href=""http://www.lightwoodgames.com/get/sudoku-party"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sudoku Party</a>) has a crazy two-player mode like nothing you've ever seen before!</p>
<p>Our two-person programming team works quickly and efficiently to deliver stunning results.  At the recent <a href=""http://www.tiga.org/news/press-releases/winners-of-gamehack-announced"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GameHack</a> event in London, which challenged developers to create an original game in just 24 hours, we picked up two prizes - ""Best Use of Mobile"" and ""Most Innovative Idea"".  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toNHyJwne3U"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here's a video</a>.</p>
<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<p>The code for Splat the Difference is functionally complete.  At the time of writing, we have a playable solo game and a playable online two-player game.  There's some work still to do to polish the app and to add more social features to increase its virility, but this project is well under way, and it will definitely be released!</p>
<p>However, there's one area where we're currently falling short: creating awesome spot the difference puzzles.</p>
<p>Here's what we first thought a puzzle would look like:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.splatthedifference.com/images/skyscrapers.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Was it fun?  Did you find many differences?  Does this make you want to play our game?</p>
<p>Thought not.  After playtesting, we discovered that what we really need for a casual mobile game is something more like this:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.splatthedifference.com/images/sandcastles.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Hopefully you agree - it's more engaging, less headache-inducing, and even though the version here is smaller than you'd see in the game, you can probably spot all ten differences pretty quickly!</p>
<p>We made a bunch of puzzles using photos that were to hand, figuring that all it needed was an artist to do some cunning photo editing to make them fun.  We were wrong.</p>
<p>We've learned that we totally underestimated what would be needed to give this game the content it deserves.  We want to put that right, but we already burned the graphics budget getting to this stage.</p>
<p>That's not to say all the puzzles we already have are garbage.  Some of them are perfectly good; some will work if we only include a few differences but many are just so mind-bendingly impossible that we don't want them to scare players away!</p>
<p>If we ever make a super-serious spot the difference game with extra hard levels, we'll use them... but that's not this game.</p>
<p>We feel we've learned a lot about how to do this right.  We want to launch the game with a great set of puzzles, made using great pictures that we'll license from great photographers.</p>
<h3>Where will the money go?</h3>
<p>We only need money to create new graphical content.  We already have a Mac :o)  We already have a great team, and we already have the game engine.</p>
<p>We calculated that each puzzle costs about $25 to create, including licencing fees for stock photos and a freelance artist's time to do the image manipulation and generate the files we need to load it into the game.</p>
<p>We're not even factoring in our own time to do quality assurance, testing the puzzles on various display sizes.  That's actually a pretty fun job :o)</p>
<p>So every $25 pledged will result in one brand new puzzle being created.  Backers will even be able to see them in a gallery as they're selected and made.</p>
<p>We have chosen flexible funding so that we can use every dollar that is pledged to enhance the game.  The target of $2,500 reflects our goal of having 100 awesome puzzles available at launch.</p>
<p>If we exceed the goal, every additional $25 will result in another puzzle being created.  We won't include many more than 100 puzzles at first launch, but to give the game longevity we need to keep adding new puzzles to keep the game interesting.  Additional funding will help us get a jump start on this.</p>
<h3>Why 100 puzzles?</h3>
<p>Because everyone likes round numbers :o)</p>
<p>We'd originally planned on having 50 puzzles at launch, but again playtesting revealed that this was short-sighted.  Although the way we're constructing puzzles gives them some replay value (each photo has between 7 and 10 possible differences and the game asks you to find a randomly-chosen set of three) we realised that competent players would regularly be clearing a round in under 15 seconds.</p>
<p>Players can easily see 20 or more puzzles in a 10 minute play session, and the most avid players (the ones we really want to keep happy) would cycle through 50 puzzles very quickly.</p>
<p>Also, in the App Store description, being able to say ""more than 100 free puzzles"" has a really nice ring to it!</p>
<h3>Free, you say?</h3>
<p>Indeed.  All our games are free to play.  They're supported by advertising, which can be removed via an in-app purchase, and other upgrades which can be purchased for a small fee.</p>
<p>Splat the Difference implements an in-game currency system.  You earn one ""splat"" for every difference you find during gameplay, and extra bonus splats for completing levels quickly or winning multi-player games.</p>
<p>Save up enough splats and you can trade them in for hints to use in the game when you get stuck, a ""continue"" option to keep your high-scoring game alive just a little longer, or new game modes.  To start with, there'll be untimed mode, mirror mode and memory mode.</p>
<p>For the impatient with a credit card, it's possible to buy extra splats for a fee.</p>
<p>But all the puzzle content will be made available to all players, free or paid.  There are no extra content packs to buy.  You'll all get it all.</p>
<h3>What about the perks?</h3>
<p>We have awesome perks!</p>
<p>Almost every backer will get access to an exclusive developer blog, where we'll keep you up to date with progress and present a gallery of all the photos we're using in the game - from those we're considering turning into puzzles to those we've actually completed but decided were too hard.  If you have even a passing interest in how puzzle games are made, it's going to give you a fascinating insight into the kind of decisions we made and the workflow involved.</p>
<p>You actually want the game?  Well, it's going to be free to play for everyone.  But we can throw you some in-game currency so you can play harder, faster and longer and unlock new game modes.</p>
<p>You want to play the game now?  Then become a beta-tester.  You'll get to play the game right away, plus you'll be able to playtest new puzzles as soon as they're created. Plus, as an added bonus, we'll even listen to what you think about the game!</p>
<p>You want real stuff sent through the mail?  We've got postcards, fridge magnets and coasters.  Here's some photos.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.splatthedifference.com/images/magnets2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.splatthedifference.com/images/coasters.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You want us to make a puzzle using a photo of you?  Are you insane?  That'll be $40 please.</p>
<h3>Can I donate photographs?</h3>
<p>The easiest way for us to deal with this is to say no, because we don't want to offend any individual by saying we don't want to use your photo.</p>
<p>We're intending to select specific images from stock photography sites which meet the guidelines we've developed through the course of making this game.</p>
<p>If you feel you have an exceptional picture that would make a perfect spot the difference puzzle and you want to see it in the game, claim the ""Name the difference"" perk and we'll see if we can use it.  Photos must be your own work and you'll need to sign a licence agreement.</p>
<p>Please note that we absolutely cannot use any photographs that contain human faces, unless they're created as part of the ""Be a difference"" perk.</p>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Hello Hello</p>
<p>Im mySelf on this and i need some boost in the budget so i can hire programmers and 3d artist to finish up the game to the last state. Right now you can try the demo version of the game on <a href=""http://pixi5000.webs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font size=""5""><u>http://pixi5000.webs.com</u></font></a></p>
<p>The game is a 3D Third person shooter. It will be available on the net and it will be for free. I mean on the net where you will have a real 3D GAME and not some illusion of 3d space. The game should be available for the facebook users as well :)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><font size=""4"">HOW CAN YOU HELP? </font></p>
<p><font size=""4"">- You can help make a revolutionary change in the web gaming. It is finaly possible to   bring the third dimension into the web-browsers</font> </p>

<p><b><font size=""4"">The story</font></b></p>
<p>Pixi 5000 is a lonely robot living in the future and he is fighting the evil theft robots. The evil thefts are stealing the stars from the universe and Pixi 5000 is on a mission to stop them. Simple ha? :)</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Help with the 3D revolution in the indie web gaming. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The money will go towards three things.</p>
<p>1. Programmer. The code is good as it is, but I'd prefer to get a professional coder to really polish it and to make sure everything will run smooth before the release.</p>
<p>2. Art. I have an artist willing to work if I pay him. At the moment the commission is for a bare minimum of art for the game (environment and character archetypes). These funds will pay for those, and if there's enough money, for more art work.</p>
<p>3. Website initial costs</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Whether the goal is reached or not, the game will be published. However, it will be much better if there will be money to pay for professional editing and art work.</p>
<p>All funders will get access to the beta version of the game, to tide you over until the final version is available. Your donations will be rewarded. There is a set of various rewards for you depending on how much you donate!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to donate money you can still help. Word of mouth is a very powerful tool. You can spread the word about the campaign. Tell your gamer friends by sharing the project on Facebook, tweet and post the link to forums if are a blogger. The more people see the campaign, there is better chance to make this project reality.<br/></p>

Coraabia - Factions

Team
The
          game has been created by the independent game studio ARK8. The
          core
          team is represented by ten people who have been working on the
          project
          for several years in perfectly noncommercial conditions.

ARK8
          is just
          enthusiastic about creating games. We have been friends for
          many
          years and we are all keen players and creators ï¿½ our very first
          card
          game was developed in 1997. The team works great.
          Despite the
          complexity and implementation demands, we just love the
          developing
          and completion of the project
        is our
      greatest priority. Coraabia is being created since 2008 and its final world release should
        appear
        in May 2012 (about 1|4264 of Coraabian time). We have done a lot
        of
        work but the next project phase would be very demanding.
The private Czech
        Beta version has been released and about 500 players have already played
        it. Testers played already about 50 000 games and responded really
        positively. Local media, game magazines and TV report about the
        project in the very superlatives. However,
      further expansion or improvements are on
        the
        way ... 


     
Support us!

Coraabia is unique in the world thanks to the
        huge
        visual content, which was created by nearly 250 artists from 55
        countries. Thanks to our contagious
        enthusiasm, we have managed to get their artworks completely for
        free! Well-known names can be found among artist, for example
        Johann
        Bodin, Pascal Blanchï¿½, AndreeWallin, Robotpencil, Tarrzan, OmeN,
        Pierre Bourgeot, David Munoz Velazquez, Falk, Morgan Vilette,
        Anton
        Kokarev, Carlos Villa, David Lecossu, Goran Delic, Markus Lovadina, Riyahd Cassiem, Arturo Aguirre, David Melvin, Horia
        Dociu,
        Xue Duan, Paul Chadeisson, Mihai Liviu, Blaz Porenta, Ramï¿½n Miranda, Emma Weakly, Carlos Villa, Xia Taptara, Wanbao, Julio Iglesias, Maxim Verehin, Ivan Kashubo, Valerij Maksimov, Oliver Wetter, Nekro, Embryo and many others. Not even illustrators of
        Magic:The
        Gathering or willing people from big game companies as Blizzard or
        UbiSoft
        should be forgotten. Thanks to Coraabia artists coming from the whole world, our multiverse
        has
      an unforgettable visual character and
        we are really thankful for their present support!


Now, you can support the Coraabia project too!
        Received money will be invested into the development of the
        application
        final version, which should contain both PC and tablet versions.
        Resources will be used for setting up
        server
        facilities able to cover up
the international
        release and also for a ARK8
        members'
        symbolic
        salary, which would allow them
        finally leave their jobs and create the
        game as a real full-time job. This
        dream
        project totally fills our lives and our goal
is
        really close to reach. 

For your
        contribution, you will get a number of bonuses in the day of the
        full
        version release. Firstly, it will be a certain amount of the
        game
        currency Xot which allows you in the full version to buy
        so-called
        booster packs, it means packs with random cards. Each booster
        costs
        25-30 Xots and contains four character cards or trick cards.
 

       Rare Collectors (Coraabian Pack)
The donate version ï¿½Coraabianï¿½ contains also the exclusive rare collector cards and a special set of players'avatars.

        Guru Collectors (Iblort Pack)
The highest version ï¿½Iblortï¿½ contains especially five powerful Guru cards which will by right become real legends of the game. Their price in Coraabia will become astronomical, as it is a limited collector edition.
We highly appreciate your possible support and hope that you would love playing Coraabia after its release!

<h2><a href=""http://www.avillum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TRY THE ALPHA VERSION FOR FREE :)</a></h2>
<h3>What the hell is Avillum?</h3>
<p>Avillum is a brand new Online Trading Card Game that is currently in Alpha phase. Our goal is to make the best and more enjoyable TCG on the web. Here is a few things we think distinguish us from the others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our game is pure HTML. Players will never have to download anything to play the game. Also, we will be able to push fixes and releases very fast because people won't have to go through the painful process of updating an app.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>We want to make trading cards cool again. A lot of trading card games out there don't even allow you to trade cards, and if they do, it's through some kind of weird marketplace. We want to make it really simple to trade cards with your friends.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>So you already have an Alpha version out there?</h3>
<p>Yes! In fact, you can try it right now through <a href=""http://www.avillum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this link</a>.<br/><br/>NOTE : <br/>If there's nobody online to try it with you and you can't wait, you can simulate a game by using 2 browsers and creating 2 accounts.</p>

<h3>Nice! What do you want to add in the Beta Version?</h3>
<p>We have A LOT of ideas for this game. But like every other indie game, we gotta start somewhere. Here's what we planned to do for the Beta release : </p>
<ul>
<li>New Main Character and Starter Deck (1 hero and 16 unique cards)</li>
<li>First card collection of 75 unique cards</li>
<li>Custom Deck Builder interface</li>

<h3>Sounds good, what are some of your other ideas? </h3>

<p>We’ve got just over 24 hours left before the end of the Indiegogo campaign, and we’re still $600 dollars short of our stretch goal.  We <strong>really</strong> want to see Clyde Rhoer at Gen Con, so we’re sweetening the deal!</p>
<p>You know those two mind melting monsters James Raggi designed for us? The James Raggi who is so well-known for self-restraint? Who is certainly never prone to excess?</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Raggi’s typing hand must have slipped, because he sent us <em>four</em> monsters. And an essay. It’s about creating and using monsters in your game.</p>
<p>That’s pretty darn cool. But we haven’t even gotten to the part where we sweeten the deal yet! What if we told you those monster entries are going to be professionally laid out, and illustrated by the amazing Chris Schieffer (the guy who drew the totally wicked Githyanki picture you see above)? Because as it turns out, that <em>is </em>what we’re telling you!</p>
<p>So if that sounds awesome to you, please contribute, and tell a few friends about the awesome monsters.  If you’re feeling generous, buy a T-shirt, or a seat at one of the awesome games we’ll be running at Gen Con, or the Galileo games pack, or a custom-designed SRS for the Mecha RPG. Help us get Clyde to Gen Con. He’s an awesome guy, and he’ll make the show better.  We promise.</p>
<p>p.s. Before anybody asks, anyone who already pledged at a level that gets the James Raggi monsters will get all 4 monsters, fully awesomified, as described above.</p>
<h3>UPDATE:  Stretch Goal! Help us bring Clyde Rhoer to Gen Con!</h3>
<p>Thank you so much to everyone who's given to the campaign so far.  We reached our original goal of $1,500, and during that time we found out that Clyde Rhoer (of the Theory From the Closet and Yellow Menace podcasts, and all-around great guy) was going to miss out on Gen Con this year due to money concerns.  We couldn't let that happen!  </p>
<p>If we're able to get to $2,500, every penny past the original goal will go toward bringing Clyde to Gen Con, where he'll record Theory From the Closet-style interviews and podcast with the This Just In crew.  </p>
<p>If you're able to help, we'd appreciate it so much - and Clyde would too!  </p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update 2: The future of Expansive coverage </strong></p>
<p>We want to clarify some things about the future of Expansive coverage should specific stretch goals be met. We’re also excited to make a few additional announcements today.</p>
<p><strong>Welsh Games Coverage</strong></p>
<p>As you can see from our 5K goal, we’re focusing on covering the Welsh Gaming Industry in full. Presently, there is no press for games in Wales. The local media is primarily focused on politics, sport and lifestyle events. This is hugely disappointing as there are so many exciting things happening, such as a South Wales Games Development Show, support from BAFTA Cyrmu and various gaming projects, both announced and unannounced. Welsh Games have no promotion whatsoever, and that desperately needs to change in order for the local industry to thrive.</p>
<p>My aim with Expansive is to become that outlet. We’ll provide interviews, reviews, previews and news from all things Welsh Gaming and branch it out as its own separate sub-site. The Indiegogo Campaign was founded on promoting games journalism in Wales and if successful, I will also seek to recruit some local freelance writers to help produce regular, engaging coverage, drawing on their experiences to source stories. Of course, this will be completely dependent on the closing budget of the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Browser/Facebook Gaming Coverage</strong></p>
<p>We’re looking to encompass coverage of other, more niche areas in the games industry to expand our end-product. You’ve already seen that we will be actively covering both Xbox One and Playstation 4 news. We also support Wii U, Mobile, PC, and other handheld devices. With successful campaign funding, we also intend to support Browser and Facebook-themed gaming.</p>
<p>One of the most popular types of gaming on the planet, amazingly, there isn’t an outlet out there that looks at coverage in detail. We aim to change that! Considering many of the released games expand narrative and gaming worlds (Plants vs Zombies Adventures, The Sims, The Hobbit) there’s plenty out there for us to cover.</p>
<p>Naturally, freelancers with a specific knowledge set will be called upon to help with this coverage, dependant on budget.</p>
<p><strong>Ouya</strong></p>
<p>A new gaming platform that received backing through crowdfunding, Ouya is already building a lot of momentum in the build up to launch. I’m excited to announce that, with ample funding, we intend to support Ouya on Expansive. We aim to get hold of a console and produce all the coverage you want to see. Several units would likely be sourced so various members of the team can share out the coverage. Our coverage would include standard news, reviews, previews and interviews, as well as occasional opinion pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Oculus Rift</strong></p>
<p>Many dub this the ‘true next-gen of gaming’; Oculus Rift finally brings our Virtual Reality dreams to life. I’m excited to reveal that Oculus Rift is something we’re very keen to cover on Expansive. Old games are already being patched to receive support (such as Mirror’s Edge) and many new games are having it built into their code so they’re playable out of the box. As a true expansion of gaming worlds, we’d offer extensive patch reviews and assess just how much the Oculus Rift contributes to the video games industry. We’d also offer news and interviews, as well as opinion pieces.</p>
<p><strong>MMO</strong></p>
<p>While we already cover MMOs, we recognise that we’re not doing enough. They’re a massive part of the gaming market and for future patch reviews, we need to ensure those who do patch reviews are fully aware of what a game has done before, what it’s doing now and what direction it is heading in/where it needs to be. We’ll offer freelance to people with a specific skill-set and also supply more news, as well as deeper coverage of MMOs we haven’t previously covered and those we’re already covering.</p>
<p>I hope this provides clarity and perspective of our intentions and what we will do with some of the funding received from this campaign. As we’ve previously stated, the site is currently done as a part-time hobby, but if successful, we can become an all-encompassing, full-time outlet that provides cutting-edge coverage for some of the current gaps in the industry.</p>
<p>In the coming days we will offer further clarity on some of the other stretch goals we have planned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong></p>
<p>Just to briefly talk about our Podcast aspirations. We're hoping to have a team of four, myself included for all recordings. Each Individuals will alternate hosting the podcast and each podcast will take on a different theme. Each theme will relate to gaming expansion in some way.</p>
<p>The podcast will also include DLC news, upcoming patches, cool new mods, reader questions, competitions, local gaming news (from all over the country) and more. There is absolutely nothing like the podcast we're working on right now. A huge gap in the market exists for a podcast of this type and we aim to fill it with our own unique style of games reporting.</p>
<p>The money will be used to help set all of our crew up with appropriate audio equipment. This includes equipment which can be taken remotely and used for interviews with local people. We'll also use this money to do greater levels of research into our own local area of gaming and expand that coverage so that we're informing our listeners as much as possible and also do our best to offer some exclusives which makes the Podcast all the more worthwhile in listening to.</p>
<p>If you have any feedback or questions, please feel free to leave them in the comments.</p>
<p>In the coming days, we'll release more details on the Expansive App, as well as the Expansive E-Zine.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking around :)</p>
<p> <strong> </strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Expansive? What’s this all about then?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> <em>We will be producing videos throughout the campaign.</em></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.expansivedlc.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Expansive</a> has been operating for just under five months. It’s a young, fresh outlet still developing its community and continuing to carve out a niche. The site is unique in that it’s entirely focused on updates, patches, fixes, mods, content updates, DLC and other related areas for console, mobile and PC games. Expansive supports this through news, reviews, previews, overviews and interviews.</p>
<p>The site has got a good thing going and has already built a lot of momentum. In under five months, it's amassed 150,000 Page Views and over 60,000 Unique Hits. The owner of the website is an active part of the video games industry and has already made fantastic, high-profile contacts. As a result, Expansive has received amazing support post-launch. Still, the site isn’t at the standard it could or should be.</p>
<p>To achieve that, Expansive needs your help.</p>
<p>To give you some background, the owner of Expansive, Ray Willmott, is an established, part-time freelance games journalist with over four years of experience. His work can regularly be seen in The Sun Newspaper’s <a href=""http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/fun/gaming/4636136/Halo-4-review.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Games Column</a>, but has also been published in/on GamesTM, PLAY magazine, <a href=""http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1615757/peter_molyneux_talks_nextgen_curiosity_coronation_street.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NOWGamer</a>, <a href=""http://sabotagetimes.com/reportage/the-wiiu-how-nintendo-have-revolutionised-multiplayer-gaming/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sabotage Times</a>, <a href=""http://www.148apps.com/reviews/galaxy-life-pocket-adventures/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">148Apps</a> and, most recently, <a href=""http://www.vg247.com/2013/05/14/wales-the-uk-games-industrys-forgotten-fourth-quarter/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">VG247</a>. The majority of Ray's work can be seen on <a href=""http://www.thisismyjoystick.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">This Is My Joystick</a>! where he has contributed for over four years.</p>
<p>Alongside <a href=""http://expansivedlc.com/about-the-expansive-review-policy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Expansive Overviews</a>, which provide appraisals on the latest games, and a monthly DLC <a href=""http://expansivedlc.com/may-dlc-release-schedule/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">release schedule</a>, Expansive has pioneered the gaming patch review and is focused on consistently giving ever-developing games a fair shout with a score before and after the patch, then giving the game a current rating out of 5. If developers are willing to keep ironing out bugs and adding content, the site is willing to keep reporting on those games. Check out recent patch reviews for <a href=""http://expansivedlc.com/patch-review-gears-of-war-judgment/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gears Judgment</a>, <a href=""http://expansivedlc.com/patch-review-crysis-3-1-3/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crysis 3</a> and <a href=""http://expansivedlc.com/patch-review-guild-wars-2-flame-frost-the-razing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Guild Wars 2</a> to give you an idea of how these work.</p>
<p>Expansive also apply patch reviews to console firmware and have recently written about <a href=""http://expansivedlc.com/firmware-review-playstation-vita-patch-2-1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Playstation Vita</a> and <a href=""http://expansivedlc.com/firmware-review-wii-u-patch-3-0-0/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wii U</a> patches, assessing their overall impact on each individual system. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are still many challenges. The main problem is that Expansive is a glorified hobby. The site receives very limited money from ads. It is not self-sustaining, so the owners are investing their own money to keep things running, and are forced to work around our full-time jobs. This, coupled with the trials and tribulations of everyday life, means that Expansive cannot be our first priority. We want to be in a position to support writers financially, but we simply can't be. At least, not at the moment.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of work to be done and, as you can see from our stretch goals, we have a lot of ambition. However, we believe we can do it, as well as set the foundations for other exciting projects we’re planning. All we need is an extra boost to get the ball rolling. </p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center"">Expansive needs £5,000 to get things started. Here's what we'll accomplish with that money. </p>
<p><strong>Improve regularity, have better attendance at events, create opportunities for exclusives, bolster content output:</strong> Expect more detailed reports, up-to-date, current coverage, more exclusives, tighter turn-around times and more content opportunities explored on all covered formats. This funding would enable us to be better placed at gaming events in the UK, covering travelling expenditure and accomodation where necessary. We regularly miss out on major overseas events, such as E3 or GDC, and we would like to be covering those on the site in our own unique way. The funding will ensure we have business cards printed and some access to quality, remote recording equipment. We’ll also increase regularity of our current League of Legends and Guild Wars 2 columns, as well as explore other columns and concepts in the pipe-line. Current ideas include columns based on The Old Republic, World of Warcraft, Defiance and DayZ, as well as unique features and opinion pieces. We will also be offering in-depth coverage of the Welsh Games Industry, giving it a seperate sub-site.. On top of that, we'll also be creating a one-stop hub for mods, investigating Steam Workshop in full and also other sites/people that provide mods for games. This would be a powered database specifically designed to provide key mod information about your chosen game and provide easy stop links, as well as links to mini reviews to help you decide if that mod is for you. Additionally, we will improve our DLC release schedule in a similar way, making it more user friendly, update it more effeciently and offering more content through it. - <strong>£5k</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Site Redesign, improved hosting, additional domain purchasing, extra site content and forums: </strong></strong>We want to keep the heart and soul blog-theme of Expansive alive, but ideally give it something more distinct, identifiable and individual. We have ideas, but need time, resources, and, of course, finances to make them possible. The idea is to create a better interface for navigation, making it easier to find the content you’re looking for and continue to help the site carve out an identity. We will add Facebook and browser game coverage to the site and potentially consider subsites under one Expansive banner if content becomes too excessive. We will purchase additional domains and upgrade our hosting for constant care and attention, ensuring downtime is minimal. We will also set up new, improved Forums.<strong> </strong><strong>- <strong>£10k<br/></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Making the site completely ad-free:</strong> We currently use ads to help fund the site’s upkeep for hosting, as well as paying for the web-domain, consulting, event attendance, accommodation and postage. This stretch goal will enable us to remove ads completely for 2 years, making the site un-intrusive, seamless and completely self-sustaining. Several sub-sites will be created under one Expansive banner for even greater ease of navigation. The money will also let us hire occasional freelance writers to contribute to Expansive and provide varied content from different walks of life. While the first 2 goals would cover some of this, it wouldn't cover all costs for this period of time. We will also offer Ouya coverage, giving it a seperate sub-site. - <strong>£20k</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio setups:</strong> We have a team of four ready to get involved and also lined up a few guests, but whenever we've started a podcast, the recording has been deleted or corrupted. Many of you will know these frustrations, I'm sure. So, we want proper equipment for four people. We want to provide the best possible opportunities to get the best quality equipment. When setting up a Podcast, we’d currently be using a computer mic, skype and audacity. Ideally, we want to use a better recording programme with better recording software, equipment and someone designated to edit the podcasts to make them structured, creating a tight format and making them much easier on the ear. This goal would allow us to purchase equipment for several people, enabling us to have a full-time, podcasting team. This would also mean quickly edited, timely podcasts on significant issues, and even allow us to approach special guests and have them feature on the show. This money would be put to use to create the best possible audio experience for any Expansive projects using audio. Our first Podcast project will look at the current DLC scene in gaming and how it is changing the industry as we move closer to next-gen. We will also provide Oculus Rift coverage as well as improved MMO coverage, giving them both seperate sub-sites.  - <strong>£30</strong><strong>k</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video content:</strong> We have ambitious video content goals. This goal will allow several of us to buy better recording equipment and appropriate software for picture quality. This will help us produce better video content for patch reviews, overviews, previews, interviews and more. We would also use this equipment for filming at events and providing an Expansive perspective on all upcoming games. This funding will ensure several staffers are equipped properly for this purpose. - <strong>£40k</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fund full-time staffer and provide freelance:</strong> We’re currently an ndependent outlet. As a result, the site is worked on as and when people can. We want to be offering more, and to do that we recognise the need to employ at least one member of staff working on Expansive full-time. This will enable us to post more often, offer up-to-date, breaking news stories and timely review coverage. We will also play through older games, looking at their patches, updates and DLC, reporting on them as we go. In addition, we will produce reviews of older content to give the site a legacy library and deeper database of content for those interested in historic coverage. This may mean purchasing titles, as well as doing research and potentially hiring specialists that are historically familiar with the intellectual property in question. This funding will also allow the site to have a more professional front, making sure somebody is available to go to more events and PR functions, which will improve our relationships within the industry. In addition, we will be able to offer freelance work and improve our overall coverage, recruiting people with specific knowledge sets. - <strong>£55k</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Expansive App:</strong> For iOS, Blackberry and Android (potentially other OS'), we have some great ideas to make an accompanying app for the Expansive website. Its introduction presents some exciting possibilities, making the site more accessible and potentially broadening the site’s audience. The app would be easy to refresh and navigate, keeping readers up to date with news and features. It would likely have push notifications, and interchangeable backgrounds for ease of reading. It would be mobile and tablet-friendly, made free to download and offer various unique touches to compliment the Expansive experience. To donaters, early access would be given, as well as the ability to provide feedback and help develop the app in early stages. -  <strong>£100k</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vidcasts:</strong> Vidcasts would feature Geoff the Cat sat alongside the team; all fully voiced, animated, and even interactive and subtitled where applicable. In episodes, Geoff will offer his gaming input, as well as provide some hints, tips and previews on the latest games. However, it’ll also be down to the team to make sure he doesn’t get himself into mischief. The vidcast will offer live streams, reviews, previews, interviews, game footage, and other unique content. This would be fully supported by the Expansive App detailed above. - <strong>£125k</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Expansive E-Zine: </strong>We want to produce a regular E-Zine for Expansive that introduces content to a broader audience. This would be filled with unique content, such as comic strips, columns and interviews, as well as previews and reviews. The E-zine will be interactive and have content tailored specifically for this audience. The aim would be to make it available via the app, as well as selling it on the Kindle Store and through other e-reader marketplaces. Audio reviews will also be considered, as well as other opportunities to make content accessible to others. - <strong style=""line-height: 0px;"">£150k</strong><strong style=""line-height: 0px;""> </strong></p>

<p align=""center""> <strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve thought long and hard about putting Expansive on Indiegogo and it’s fair to say that the project has divided opinion. We’re all unified on one thing, though: we want Expansive to succeed. We want people to have the site they deserve, and hope that the ideas being presented to you are also in-line with the things you’d like to see from a gaming site of this nature. The aim is to create something that fully considers and benefits our audience no matter how they like to digest their gaming information.</p>
<p>Indiegogo has been designed so people can bring their creative aspirations to life. Right now, the site is wholly independent. We manage to accomplish a lot with an amazing group of part-time volunteers, and have attracted viewers from all over the world, but we could be doing a lot more.</p>
<p>If this isn’t something you’d like to see, no problem. Thanks for stopping by and we appreciate the time you've taken to consider our pitch.  </p>
<p>If it is, then please consider helping us fund this campaign. Share. Spread the word. Who knows where things could lead?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>What happens if we don’t get funded?</strong></p>
<p>To coin a popular phrase, we’ll “<em>Keep Calm and Carry On</em>.” The site will still be online after the closure of the Indiegogo campaign, and it’ll still be doing what it does right now. We still aim to achieve as many of these goals as possible, however funding will ensure they are of the standard they could and should be. These features will also become part of the Expansive experience much quicker. </p></div>","UPDATE 1Thank you for your kind contributions and comments.

One of the most popular types of gaming on the planet, amazingly, there isn’t an outlet out there that looks at coverage in detail. We aim to change that! Considering many of the released games expand narrative and gaming worlds (Plants vs Zombies Adventures, The Sims, The Hobbit) there’s plenty out there for us to cover.
Naturally, freelancers with a specific knowledge set will be called upon to help with this coverage, dependant on budget.
Ouya
A new gaming platform that received backing through crowdfunding, Ouya is already building a lot of momentum in the build up to launch. I’m excited to announce that, with ample funding, we intend to support Ouya on Expansive. We aim to get hold of a console and produce all the coverage you want to see. Several units would likely be sourced so various members of the team can share out the coverage. Our coverage would include standard news, reviews, previews and interviews, as well as occasional opinion pieces.
Oculus Rift
Many dub this the ‘true next-gen of gaming’; Oculus Rift finally brings our Virtual Reality dreams to life. I’m excited to reveal that Oculus Rift is something we’re very keen to cover on Expansive. Old games are already being patched to receive support (such as Mirror’s Edge) and many new games are having it built into their code so they’re playable out of the box. As a true expansion of gaming worlds, we’d offer extensive patch reviews and assess just how much the Oculus Rift contributes to the video games industry. We’d also offer news and interviews, as well as opinion pieces.
MMO
While we already cover MMOs, we recognise that we’re not doing enough. They’re a massive part of the gaming market and for future patch reviews, we need to ensure those who do patch reviews are fully aware of what a game has done before, what it’s doing now and what direction it is heading in/where it needs to be. We’ll offer freelance to people with a specific skill-set and also supply more news, as well as deeper coverage of MMOs we haven’t previously covered and those we’re already covering.
I hope this provides clarity and perspective of our intentions and what we will do with some of the funding received from this campaign. As we’ve previously stated, the site is currently done as a part-time hobby, but if successful, we can become an all-encompassing, full-time outlet that provides cutting-edge coverage for some of the current gaps in the industry.
In the coming days we will offer further clarity on some of the other stretch goals we have planned.
 
UPDATE 3
Just to briefly talk about our Podcast aspirations. We're hoping to have a team of four, myself included for all recordings. Each Individuals will alternate hosting the podcast and each podcast will take on a different theme. Each theme will relate to gaming expansion in some way.
The podcast will also include DLC news, upcoming patches, cool new mods, reader questions, competitions, local gaming news (from all over the country) and more. There is absolutely nothing like the podcast we're working on right now. A huge gap in the market exists for a podcast of this type and we aim to fill it with our own unique style of games reporting.
The money will be used to help set all of our crew up with appropriate audio equipment. This includes equipment which can be taken remotely and used for interviews with local people. We'll also use this money to do greater levels of research into our own local area of gaming and expand that coverage so that we're informing our listeners as much as possible and also do our best to offer some exclusives which makes the Podcast all the more worthwhile in listening to.
If you have any feedback or questions, please feel free to leave them in the comments.
In the coming days, we'll release more details on the Expansive App, as well as the Expansive E-Zine.
Thanks for sticking around :)
  
Expansive? What’s this all about then? 
Please Note: We will be producing videos throughout the campaign.
Expansive has been operating for just under five months. It’s a young, fresh outlet still developing its community and continuing to carve out a niche. The site is unique in that it’s entirely focused on updates, patches, fixes, mods, content updates, DLC and other related areas for console, mobile and PC games. Expansive supports this through news, reviews, previews, overviews and interviews.
The site has got a good thing going and has already built a lot of momentum. In under five months, it's amassed 150,000 Page Views and over 60,000 Unique Hits. The owner of the website is an active part of the video games industry and has already made fantastic, high-profile contacts. As a result, Expansive has received amazing support post-launch. Still, the site isn’t at the standard it could or should be.
To achieve that, Expansive needs your help.
To give you some background, the owner of Expansive, Ray Willmott, is an established, part-time freelance games journalist with over four years of experience. His work can regularly be seen in The Sun Newspaper’s Games Column, but has also been published in/on GamesTM, PLAY magazine, NOWGamer, Sabotage Times, 148Apps and, most recently, VG247. The majority of Ray's work can be seen on This Is My Joystick! where he has contributed for over four years.
Alongside Expansive Overviews, which provide appraisals on the latest games, and a monthly DLC release schedule, Expansive has pioneered the gaming patch review and is focused on consistently giving ever-developing games a fair shout with a score before and after the patch, then giving the game a current rating out of 5. If developers are willing to keep ironing out bugs and adding content, the site is willing to keep reporting on those games. Check out recent patch reviews for Gears Judgment, Crysis 3 and Guild Wars 2 to give you an idea of how these work.
Expansive also apply patch reviews to console firmware and have recently written about Playstation Vita and Wii U patches, assessing their overall impact on each individual system. 
Unfortunately, there are still many challenges. The main problem is that Expansive is a glorified hobby. The site receives very limited money from ads. It is not self-sustaining, so the owners are investing their own money to keep things running, and are forced to work around our full-time jobs. This, coupled with the trials and tribulations of everyday life, means that Expansive cannot be our first priority. We want to be in a position to support writers financially, but we simply can't be. At least, not at the moment.
There’s a lot of work to be done and, as you can see from our stretch goals, we have a lot of ambition. However, we believe we can do it, as well as set the foundations for other exciting projects we’re planning. All we need is an extra boost to get the ball rolling. 
 
Expansive needs £5,000 to get things started. Here's what we'll accomplish with that money. 
Improve regularity, have better attendance at events, create opportunities for exclusives, bolster content output: Expect more detailed reports, up-to-date, current coverage, more exclusives, tighter turn-around times and more content opportunities explored on all covered formats. This funding would enable us to be better placed at gaming events in the UK, covering travelling expenditure and accomodation where necessary. We regularly miss out on major overseas events, such as E3 or GDC, and we would like to be covering those on the site in our own unique way. The funding will ensure we have business cards printed and some access to quality, remote recording equipment. We’ll also increase regularity of our current League of Legends and Guild Wars 2 columns, as well as explore other columns and concepts in the pipe-line. Current ideas include columns based on The Old Republic, World of Warcraft, Defiance and DayZ, as well as unique features and opinion pieces. We will also be offering in-depth coverage of the Welsh Games Industry, giving it a seperate sub-site.. On top of that, we'll also be creating a one-stop hub for mods, investigating Steam Workshop in full and also other sites/people that provide mods for games. This would be a powered database specifically designed to provide key mod information about your chosen game and provide easy stop links, as well as links to mini reviews to help you decide if that mod is for you. Additionally, we will improve our DLC release schedule in a similar way, making it more user friendly, update it more effeciently and offering more content through it. - £5k
Site Redesign, improved hosting, additional domain purchasing, extra site content and forums: We want to keep the heart and soul blog-theme of Expansive alive, but ideally give it something more distinct, identifiable and individual. We have ideas, but need time, resources, and, of course, finances to make them possible. The idea is to create a better interface for navigation, making it easier to find the content you’re looking for and continue to help the site carve out an identity. We will add Facebook and browser game coverage to the site and potentially consider subsites under one Expansive banner if content becomes too excessive. We will purchase additional domains and upgrade our hosting for constant care and attention, ensuring downtime is minimal. We will also set up new, improved Forums. - £10k
Making the site completely ad-free: We currently use ads to help fund the site’s upkeep for hosting, as well as paying for the web-domain, consulting, event attendance, accommodation and postage. This stretch goal will enable us to remove ads completely for 2 years, making the site un-intrusive, seamless and completely self-sustaining. Several sub-sites will be created under one Expansive banner for even greater ease of navigation. The money will also let us hire occasional freelance writers to contribute to Expansive and provide varied content from different walks of life. While the first 2 goals would cover some of this, it wouldn't cover all costs for this period of time. We will also offer Ouya coverage, giving it a seperate sub-site. - £20k
Audio setups: We have a team of four ready to get involved and also lined up a few guests, but whenever we've started a podcast, the recording has been deleted or corrupted. Many of you will know these frustrations, I'm sure. So, we want proper equipment for four people. We want to provide the best possible opportunities to get the best quality equipment. When setting up a Podcast, we’d currently be using a computer mic, skype and audacity. Ideally, we want to use a better recording programme with better recording software, equipment and someone designated to edit the podcasts to make them structured, creating a tight format and making them much easier on the ear. This goal would allow us to purchase equipment for several people, enabling us to have a full-time, podcasting team. This would also mean quickly edited, timely podcasts on significant issues, and even allow us to approach special guests and have them feature on the show. This money would be put to use to create the best possible audio experience for any Expansive projects using audio. Our first Podcast project will look at the current DLC scene in gaming and how it is changing the industry as we move closer to next-gen. We will also provide Oculus Rift coverage as well as improved MMO coverage, giving them both seperate sub-sites.  - £30k
Video content: We have ambitious video content goals. This goal will allow several of us to buy better recording equipment and appropriate software for picture quality. This will help us produce better video content for patch reviews, overviews, previews, interviews and more. We would also use this equipment for filming at events and providing an Expansive perspective on all upcoming games. This funding will ensure several staffers are equipped properly for this purpose. - £40k
Fund full-time staffer and provide freelance: We’re currently an ndependent outlet. As a result, the site is worked on as and when people can. We want to be offering more, and to do that we recognise the need to employ at least one member of staff working on Expansive full-time. This will enable us to post more often, offer up-to-date, breaking news stories and timely review coverage. We will also play through older games, looking at their patches, updates and DLC, reporting on them as we go. In addition, we will produce reviews of older content to give the site a legacy library and deeper database of content for those interested in historic coverage. This may mean purchasing titles, as well as doing research and potentially hiring specialists that are historically familiar with the intellectual property in question. This funding will also allow the site to have a more professional front, making sure somebody is available to go to more events and PR functions, which will improve our relationships within the industry. In addition, we will be able to offer freelance work and improve our overall coverage, recruiting people with specific knowledge sets. - £55k
The Expansive App: For iOS, Blackberry and Android (potentially other OS'), we have some great ideas to make an accompanying app for the Expansive website. Its introduction presents some exciting possibilities, making the site more accessible and potentially broadening the site’s audience. The app would be easy to refresh and navigate, keeping readers up to date with news and features. It would likely have push notifications, and interchangeable backgrounds for ease of reading. It would be mobile and tablet-friendly, made free to download and offer various unique touches to compliment the Expansive experience. To donaters, early access would be given, as well as the ability to provide feedback and help develop the app in early stages. -  £100k
Vidcasts: Vidcasts would feature Geoff the Cat sat alongside the team; all fully voiced, animated, and even interactive and subtitled where applicable. In episodes, Geoff will offer his gaming input, as well as provide some hints, tips and previews on the latest games. However, it’ll also be down to the team to make sure he doesn’t get himself into mischief. The vidcast will offer live streams, reviews, previews, interviews, game footage, and other unique content. This would be fully supported by the Expansive App detailed above. - £125k
The Expansive E-Zine: We want to produce a regular E-Zine for Expansive that introduces content to a broader audience. This would be filled with unique content, such as comic strips, columns and interviews, as well as previews and reviews. The E-zine will be interactive and have content tailored specifically for this audience. The aim would be to make it available via the app, as well as selling it on the Kindle Store and through other e-reader marketplaces. Audio reviews will also be considered, as well as other opportunities to make content accessible to others. - £150k 

 
 Why Indiegogo?
We’ve thought long and hard about putting Expansive on Indiegogo and it’s fair to say that the project has divided opinion. We’re all unified on one thing, though: we want Expansive to succeed. We want people to have the site they deserve, and hope that the ideas being presented to you are also in-line with the things you’d like to see from a gaming site of this nature. The aim is to create something that fully considers and benefits our audience no matter how they like to digest their gaming information.
Indiegogo has been designed so people can bring their creative aspirations to life. Right now, the site is wholly independent. We manage to accomplish a lot with an amazing group of part-time volunteers, and have attracted viewers from all over the world, but we could be doing a lot more.
If this isn’t something you’d like to see, no problem. Thanks for stopping by and we appreciate the time you've taken to consider our pitch.  
If it is, then please consider helping us fund this campaign. Share. Spread the word. Who knows where things could lead?
 
What happens if we don’t get funded?
To coin a popular phrase, we’ll “Keep Calm and Carry On.” The site will still be online after the closure of the Indiegogo campaign, and it’ll still be doing what it does right now. We still aim to achieve as many of these goals as possible, however funding will ensure they are of the standard they could and should be. These features will also become part of the Expansive experience much quicker.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Sam John is a courageous 16 year old from Fareham, UK who urgently needs a specific Proton Therapy (not available in the UK until 2017) to treat his inoperable brain tumour...This is a story which will touch your heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2006, Sam John’s world was turned upside down, when aged 9, he was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour…life would never be the same:</p>
<p>For the past 7 years, Sam (who lives with his Mum Vicki, Dad Steve and younger brother Matthew, in Fareham, Hampshire) has fought infections, undergone surgical procedures and endured countless blood transfusions – yet never losing sight of hope, and showing incredible strength and courage.</p>
<p>A scan on the 11th March 2013 showed that Sam’s tumour has grown, and become more active – Sam readily needs Proton Therapy which will not be available in the UK until 2017. This will be too late for Sam.</p>
<p> Having turned 16 just two months ago, Sam does not qualify for the specific NHS funding towards this particular type of Proton Treatment so we need YOUR help to get him to the USA!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don’t know Sam, but when reading his Facebook page I couldn’t help but want to get involved and do what I can.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I never run the marathon, and I doubt I could. I can’t shave my head as Jessie J just made that cool. So I am doing something that scares the shite out of me in the hope that you are donate what you can. Its not like I do this every year, so I would really appreciate me falling from a friggin plane make an actual difference to this boys life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please give what you can. To put things in perspective, you probably spend over £20 in Stabucks each week.</p>
<p>The date of my sky dive is being set at the end of the month, but we don’t  have long to raise money, so I will be doing this in May or June.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On another note, you only get the dive free with a registered charity, which Sam’s family are trying to set up. So I will personally be covering the cost of my dive, all I am asking for you lot, is that you donate to Sam.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you all SO much</p>

The game takes place in the wild biker’s world with a light and fun atmosphere due to a cartoonish graphical style, and an arcade oriented gameplay.

<h3>That's nice and all, but come on, do you need a whopping $100,000 for that?</h3>
<p>Yes and no. As developing a website like this has been our dream for years, we will definitely make it come true. But we know it's a lot of work. The more money you pledge, the more features we can add and the faster we can make it happen. So, what do we do when you contribute?</p>

<p>Serenity Online is a text-based fantasy game that takes place in a mystical Kingdom known as Zuelia. The kingdom of Zuelia has known peace for as long as its history has been recorded; however, recently there has been a dispute from within the rankings. From this quarrel grew two separate clans; those who still follow loyally under the King’s name – the Shams, and those who have torn apart from the ways of peace and choose to follow the rebellion – the Qamar.</p>
<p>These two factions are now engaged in a growing war within the Goddess Serene’s land and the weight of this war might very well depend on you- the people of her land! Hone your skills in weaponry, crafting, and even magic! Join the world of Serenity and fight for the cause you believe in!</p>
<p>Players can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>An epic storyline following the war of Zuelia and the Gods/Goddesses of Serenity</li>
<li>Unique weapons and armor</li>
<li>Multiple crafting systems and professions</li>
<li>Side quests to collect crystals and improve your skills</li>
<li>A marriage system</li>
<li>Dungeons</li>
<li>Server wide boss-fights</li>
<li>Buying your own house</li>
<li>Personal shops</li>
<li>Pet system</li>
<li>Team up with others to take down stronger opponents</li>
<li>And so much more in the making!</li>
</ul>
<p>Serenity will be a browser-based game that requires no download! You will be able to party up with friends and engage in this wondrous journey together in this textual fantasy right after registering your account! The game will be able to be played under two different themes – Sun or Moon!! Choose or change your theme at any time to fit your mood or personality of your character!</p>

At the end of the day, the funds in the pool are redistributed to the players based on their score and ranking in completing the day's puzzles. This means they can win up to 5 times the playing fee of €1. In addition, there will be a daily grand prize winner taking 0.5% of the pool which can be thousands. Winners will then be eligible to a potential TV version of the game currently in development with Dutch television networks.</p><p></p><p>We have developed the concept and the platform, and we're now looking to raise 50,000 Euro to cover launch and marketing costs and offering very favourable revenue sharing opportunities for our initial investors (See Perks).</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2>Our Technological and Intellectual Property Assets</h2><p>Antigony is a simple yet innovative word game based on riddles and antonyms, but it allows something unique: Skill-based competition with cash winnings. Not fixed winnings, but winnings paid out according to performance relative to other players, even in a single player game.</p><p>This is made possible by Creative Minds’ DPS (Dynamic Pool System) platform which tightly integrates the game’s scoring elements, funding, and payouts resulting in a powerful framework capable of dynamically assigning and shifting payouts based on scores, odds, rankings and even relational parameters. All this while respecting the boundaries of the funding pool and the company’s earning requirements.</p><p>We developed this system to allow the automatic creation of a pool of funds by grouping together all the individual players’ participation fees, and dynamically ranking the players, with no possibility of duplicate positions, and then allocating exponential payouts based on each player’s ranking that will total out to the exact amount of the pool, minus the company’s take. This no matter the scores, no matter the funds, and no matter the number of players.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1070914/files/20141204072756-payout.png?1417706876"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>So while the innovative and addictive gameplay of our initial game, Antigony, is the key to our immediate success, its underlaying platform is what ensures we can continue to provide unique skill- and chance-based games in the future. We will also be licensing the technology and even create an API so that other developers can host their games on our platform in a modular fashion.<br/></p><p></p><h2><br/></h2><h2>Miscellaneous</h2><h3>Project Timeline</h3><p>Our current target is to set up a Beta test launch on March 1st 2015 with a formal soft launch on March 15th. A marketing blitz will coincide with the hard launch of the game site on April 1st.</p><h3>Marketing</h3><p>To maximize demographic targeting, we will focus our initial marketing on print word game publications, challenging traditional word game players to compete with each other.

At the end of the day, the funds in the pool are redistributed to the players based on their score and ranking in completing the day's puzzles. This means they can win up to 5 times the playing fee of €1. In addition, there will be a daily grand prize winner taking 0.5% of the pool which can be thousands. Winners will then be eligible to a potential TV version of the game currently in development with Dutch television networks.We have developed the concept and the platform, and we're now looking to raise 50,000 Euro to cover launch and marketing costs and offering very favourable revenue sharing opportunities for our initial investors (See Perks).Our Technological and Intellectual Property AssetsAntigony is a simple yet innovative word game based on riddles and antonyms, but it allows something unique: Skill-based competition with cash winnings. Not fixed winnings, but winnings paid out according to performance relative to other players, even in a single player game.This is made possible by Creative Minds’ DPS (Dynamic Pool System) platform which tightly integrates the game’s scoring elements, funding, and payouts resulting in a powerful framework capable of dynamically assigning and shifting payouts based on scores, odds, rankings and even relational parameters. All this while respecting the boundaries of the funding pool and the company’s earning requirements.We developed this system to allow the automatic creation of a pool of funds by grouping together all the individual players’ participation fees, and dynamically ranking the players, with no possibility of duplicate positions, and then allocating exponential payouts based on each player’s ranking that will total out to the exact amount of the pool, minus the company’s take. This no matter the scores, no matter the funds, and no matter the number of players.So while the innovative and addictive gameplay of our initial game, Antigony, is the key to our immediate success, its underlaying platform is what ensures we can continue to provide unique skill- and chance-based games in the future. We will also be licensing the technology and even create an API so that other developers can host their games on our platform in a modular fashion.MiscellaneousProject TimelineOur current target is to set up a Beta test launch on March 1st 2015 with a formal soft launch on March 15th. A marketing blitz will coincide with the hard launch of the game site on April 1st.MarketingTo maximize demographic targeting, we will focus our initial marketing on print word game publications, challenging traditional word game players to compete with each other. This media has the added benefit of being highly cost effective with very low advertising fees and long exposure times.A planned future development is the creation of an Antigony TV programme (discussions with networks are already underway) that would obtain its participants from the top performers of the online game. This would obviously represent enormous and highly effective publicity and further incentivise the playing of the online game.Earning ProjectionsOur current initial forecast is to sign up about 45,000 users (in a market of over 8 million word game players) in the first month of operation - April 2015 - through an initial advertising and marketing blitz to be paid by this campaign. Subsequent income will be reinvested towards additional marketing through which we believe we can sign up an additional 250,000 users by the end of the year with a 50% daily play rate. This would represent gross income of approximately €500k by December 2015. We will continue to co-develop the television concept for Antigony which will be offered free of charge to TV networks but should push Antigony online play to well over 1,000,000 players as TV contestants will be selected from the online game's winners.For more information visit our launch sites antigonygame.com (English) or antigony.nl (Dutch) where you will find more details as well as the possibility to contact us for more in-depth details (NDA required).

<p>App has been tested successfully on both Android and iOS 8(iPhone 6) - special thanks to Dan Grubbs.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>I'm Ronggowisnu from Indonesia, and this campaign is about a game app that I am making for mobile devices (currently available for android on google playstore but not yet on iOS).<br/><br/>The story of the game takes place in a fictional universe, visitors from other planets who came to the planet of Arcapada. The visitors mainly poses them selves as gods due to the advance technology they have, some does not come physically, only their soul went down to Arcapada and become one with Arcapadians. Mostly these visitors are there to help and build to direct the Arcapadians not to destroy each other as they done so in the past.<br/><br/>The game is basically a ""point &amp; tap"" where you have to solve the puzzle inside a room and move on to the next. All graphics, animations, story, concept and music are created by me. For this demo I spent about more than a month to create, 2D animation is not so easy, and doing everything by your self is also not so easy, specially when I have other work to be done.<br/><br/>This game may also be my ""jump start"" to create a small indie game development team. This campaign is for completing the ""Episode Zero"", the 1st chapter of the HoKamLo saga that I have created. If successful, I may not need to have another campaign like this one.<br/><br/>The good news? A demo version is available on Google Play Store :) <br/>You can download and try it out, if you feel this game should be completed please help me out.<br/><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ronggowisnu.tcoh1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ronggowisnu.tcoh1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ronggowisnu.tcoh1</a><br/><br/>iOS version can happen as well, because I developed this using Unity3D which can export to multiple platforms. Unfortunately I do not have an iOS device, but if funded, I will get one and make it as the development test device.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>I need $10.000, yes that much. That amount can really make me concentrate on this project without worrying other things, test devices (iOS), bills, or hire a helping hand since I have the demo on my own (quite a headache), and might lead to my own small indie game company.<br/><br/>I don't have much in return of your help, I am a musician, arranger and a guitarist. In 2012 I created an instrumental rock guitar album with my friends which leads me to this game (with the same name:HoKamLo), I can only offer you this album as a digital download for donators. The story of the album inspires me a lot to do this game.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>With the $10.000, a lot of things may happen, for sure, this game will be completed a lot sooner (Estimated 3 Months, more or less), with great quality, graphics, game play, interactivity and music. More playable characters and animations, scenery, this game started on a ""scifi"" style but HoKamLo will walk on an ancient land of Arcapada. <br/><br/>This Episode Zero, however, will consist the minimum of 10 parts (demo is only 1 part). All in the space ship, the main characters must solve all the puzzles and mysteries.<br/><br/>The game it self is a ""free"" game, perhaps when it is completed or I can manage a new Episode app, it will not be free.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>I don't consider my self to be the best marketer or campaigner, so there is a chance that the $10.000 might not goal, I have very little help in this matter. Either way, I will keep updating the game even the goal is not reached, completion may take longer. I will use what I have and what you have donated to the development of this game even if goal is not reached.<br/><br/>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The focus of this campaign:</p>
<ul><li>Hire an artist to convert my initial sketches into higher quality that matches the style used in the programming elements</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Producing a book that covers so much is not an easy feat. It's very time consuming, and requires many skills, such as: project management, programming, formatting, web design, etc.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Releasing a book on the process of making an RPG will benefit a lot of people, and hopefully encourage more people to enter the world of indie game making.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I currently have 6 books out on the process of making games in GameMaker: Studio.</p>
<p>I certainly have the skills to attempt, and complete a project as large as this.</p>
<h3>More Info On The Project</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477402774/hoyysziewjpqnfzckgdk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.therpgisland.com/RPG_Island_Preview.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here is a download in PDF of a draft of the first part of the book.</a></p>
<p>The project title is the RPG island.</p>
<p>The premise for this one is that a girl whom lives in a windmill goes to the beach on a hot a sunny day, hires a boat, gets caught in a storm. Her boat sinks and she wakes up on an island run by pirates. She then needs to raise enough cash to get passage off of the island.</p>
<p>The book consists of 40 elements, and 20 design notes, being:</p>
<p><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>- Plot (the plot of the story)</p>
<p>- Character Design (design of characters used by the story)</p>
<p>- Enemy Design (the design of non-character enemies ""nameless minions"")</p>
<p>- Objectives (the goals upon which the player must complete to advance the story)</p>
<p>- Setting (will include general theme for graphics)</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetics</strong></p>
<p>- Art-Style (what style of art the game is going to be using)</p>
<p>- Character separation (how the player sprite is going to be drawn, using single or multiple layoured sprites)</p>
<p>- Scening (how story progression is going to be implemented in the game (this is usually done by the use of cut-scenes)</p>
<p>- Sound Design (which basic sound effects the game will need, footsteps can be used for a more serious tone and etc.)</p>
<p>- View (from which angle is the player seeing the game world, first person, top down, third person, etc)</p>
<p><strong>Core Game-Play</strong></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The focus of this campaign:
Hire an artist to convert my initial sketches into higher quality that matches the style used in the programming elements

What We Need & What You Get
Producing a book that covers so much is not an easy feat. It's very time consuming, and requires many skills, such as: project management, programming, formatting, web design, etc.

The Impact
Releasing a book on the process of making an RPG will benefit a lot of people, and hopefully encourage more people to enter the world of indie game making.

Risks & Challenges
I currently have 6 books out on the process of making games in GameMaker: Studio.
I certainly have the skills to attempt, and complete a project as large as this.
More Info On The Project

Here is a download in PDF of a draft of the first part of the book.
The project title is the RPG island.
The premise for this one is that a girl whom lives in a windmill goes to the beach on a hot a sunny day, hires a boat, gets caught in a storm. Her boat sinks and she wakes up on an island run by pirates. She then needs to raise enough cash to get passage off of the island.
The book consists of 40 elements, and 20 design notes, being:
Story
- Plot (the plot of the story)
- Character Design (design of characters used by the story)
- Enemy Design (the design of non-character enemies ""nameless minions"")
- Objectives (the goals upon which the player must complete to advance the story)
- Setting (will include general theme for graphics)
Aesthetics
- Art-Style (what style of art the game is going to be using)
- Character separation (how the player sprite is going to be drawn, using single or multiple layoured sprites)
- Scening (how story progression is going to be implemented in the game (this is usually done by the use of cut-scenes)
- Sound Design (which basic sound effects the game will need, footsteps can be used for a more serious tone and etc.)
- View (from which angle is the player seeing the game world, first person, top down, third person, etc)
Core Game-Play
- Battle (the main provider of challenge in the game, Pac-Man's battle aspect is the avoidance of the ghost creatures)
- Ending (how the player can achieve Game Over. By dying, completing certain objects or finishing the story)
- Exploration (how players will travel the game world, by exploration or level select screens)
- Messaging (how players will receive information from the game, also dialogue)
- Scoring (how the scoring system of the game will work, this is also used to plan for XP in RPG games)
Extended Game-Play
- Collectables (these include secondary objectives that will be used to enhance the game's lifespan)
- Management (this includes inventory, items and power ups that the player can use to increase game depth)
- Mini-Games (such as the lock-picking games that many games now use)
- Quirks (unique or strange game-play mechanics that you want to use to make your game stand out from the others)
- Saving (saving and loading of game files to extend game life by allowing the player to enjoy multiple sit adventures)

Either way, the process will take a few weeks from the end of the campaign.This project is designed for quick turn around so, whether the campaign is a success or not, we can all be playing City Of Thieves right away! What about special perks?Contribute $45 or more and get one of our sweet Board Games - It's How I Roll t-shirts with a modest ""City Of Thieves"" logo on the back, in any combination of mens' or womens' in three colors! Contribute more and you can get your name listed on the instructions sheet in the ""Thieves Guild Roster - The Deadly Ten"" or, at the top tier, even become one of the characters with your face emblazoned on a ""Black Market"" card as a merchant! Who are you and why are you doing all this!?My name is Stacy Davidson and I'm a filmmaker and computer game designer. I've always loved card and board games. When I worked for Origin (I.E. Electronic Arts), I had endless fun playing prototype board games with my coworkers. Since then I've become addicted to shows like On Board Games, Board Games With Scott and The Dice Tower. I enjoy all kinds of games, but what I really dig are short, compact travel games I can play during downtime, waiting in line, etc. I also connect best with games featuring deep theme and setting too, so I wouldn't want to sacrifice that. City Of Thieves is my first venture into the card & board game world, and if it's successful and people enjoy it, I plan to release a series of fun little games like this over the next few years, each with a balance of chance and strategy, and a rich and intriguing fantasy or sci-fi theme so you can take fun and adventure wherever you go!Thanks for your support!",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hi, my name is Igor and I'm a graphic artist and animator ;)</p>
<p>Resistance Wars is a game which prototype came to life in a 48-hour game jam here in our town. It was great fun to work with 4 skilled programmers and a 3D artist, without whom I couldn't have made the prototype of the game.</p>
<p><br/><br/><img alt=""Resistance Wars gif 1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://amazumedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/resistance_wars_gif_2.gif"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>But when I went back to daily life, I felt I still wanted to finish the game. Not only because of all the effort I put into creating the characters and story, but also because this game could be incredibly fun after it was finished. And there's nothing similar in existence that I can go and pretend I am playing Resistance Wars... u_u</p>
<p>The problem is, the programmers are going to be too busy from now on to be working on the project. Since I created the gameplay concept, backstory, music and characters, I decided to move along with the game and try to get it made (with their consent, of course, as long as their name is in the credits, which is more than fair ;).</p>
<p><br/>And where better than <em>Indie</em>GoGo to try to raise funds to hire a programmer who could help me finish this <em>indie</em> game? Everything you see in the video was created in under 48 hours (roughly 36). So if you'd like to play this game in its full glory and have exclusive rewards, become a backer, and tell all your friends about it :)</p>

<p>Resistance Wars is what I call an assymetric multiplayer arcade tetrical shooter. What?? Wait, I'll explain: two players each control one of the two characters and they have to shoot down the tower in the center, which is controlled by a third player, who in turn can rotate the walls that are falling like tetris pieces around the tower to protect itself.

Story
Hi, my name is Igor and I'm a graphic artist and animator ;)
Resistance Wars is a game which prototype came to life in a 48-hour game jam here in our town. It was great fun to work with 4 skilled programmers and a 3D artist, without whom I couldn't have made the prototype of the game.
But when I went back to daily life, I felt I still wanted to finish the game. Not only because of all the effort I put into creating the characters and story, but also because this game could be incredibly fun after it was finished. And there's nothing similar in existence that I can go and pretend I am playing Resistance Wars... u_u
The problem is, the programmers are going to be too busy from now on to be working on the project. Since I created the gameplay concept, backstory, music and characters, I decided to move along with the game and try to get it made (with their consent, of course, as long as their name is in the credits, which is more than fair ;).
And where better than IndieGoGo to try to raise funds to hire a programmer who could help me finish this indie game? Everything you see in the video was created in under 48 hours (roughly 36). So if you'd like to play this game in its full glory and have exclusive rewards, become a backer, and tell all your friends about it :)



Gameplay
Resistance Wars is what I call an assymetric multiplayer arcade tetrical shooter. What?? Wait, I'll explain: two players each control one of the two characters and they have to shoot down the tower in the center, which is controlled by a third player, who in turn can rotate the walls that are falling like tetris pieces around the tower to protect itself. (that's why it's called assymmetric, because not all players have the same experience)
To make things more interesting, the tower has a shield around its core that can be toggled red or blue, and each character has a color for his shots, red or blue. If the shield is the same color than the shot that hits it, the tower takes no damage.
If the countdown reaches zero and the tower is still standing, the tower wins. If the tower is destroyed before countdown reaches zero, the players win.
And all three players play on the same keyboard, which is a lot of fun. If the game gets made, I think you and your friends will get a kick out of it!

</ul></div>","WHO  WE  ARE
The Courage Games celebrates the service and sacrifice of the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces through sports participation and competition. Uniting Veterans, Reservists, Guardsmen, Active Duty, and civilians through sport, the Courage Games develops camaraderie and the chance to dance in the end zone when the game is won; an entertaining way to get or stay fit and learn and affirm some life lessons along the way. 
In conjunction with the Empire State Sports Foundation and the Tulsa and Gainesville Sports Commissions , the Courage Games turns the life altering experience of these men and women into a life affirming experience through team and individual sports.  The Courage Games will start this September in Rochester, NY and in Tulsa, OK and finish in October in Gainesville, FL. The Courage Games will expand to other communities across America following the inaugural year.
WHAT  WE  NEED
We need to raise $180,000 ($60,000 per city) to conduct the event. Expenses include:

travel assistance for participants (Veterans, Reservists, Guardsmen, and Active Duty)
sports equipment
venues
officials/referees 
medals and trophies 
food service
participant apparel
etc.
IMPACT 
Camaraderie
With all of the technology in use by people today, it becomes quite easy to put oneself into a self imposed “solitary confinement”.  Face-to-face conversations and socialization are replaced by texting, tweeting, and social networking.  This is a huge adjustment for many of America’s war fighters returning home to their families and friends.  They relied on team work to accomplish their mission. Team sports keep the ancient ability of speaking to others alive and is a great way to practice this dying art.  
Individual
The best way to speak to a person’s head is through the heart, which sounds like a worn-out adage, but is so true. The Courage Games provides the service members with LSD (not the hallucinogen), but Long Steady Distance.  Exercise has a whole range of biochemical benefits to an individual’s well-being and behavior. Some of these chemicals can literally rebuild the brain. 
Citizenship
America is the ""Land of the Free"" because of the brave.  Members of the Armed Forces represent less than 2% of the population and many Americans do not know anyone in uniform.  The Courage Games will provide the opportunity for the 98% to meet and participate alongside that 2%.
Science & Medicine
The Courage Games will also sponsor two symposiums focused on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) to provide updates for medical providers. The PTSD/TBI:2012 symposia in Rochester and Gainesville will spotlight the escalating presence, as well as the causes, research, and technological advances that encompass the treatment of PTSD and TBI, both in the military and civilian populations.

</h3>
<p> We have over forty years of gaming experience between us. Whether that be playing games or working in the retail environment, selling, educating, maintaining regular customers and managing. As we watched big box stores trend towards neglecting the main demographic for video games in favour of hoping they will sell themselves we saw the opportunity to bring something to the nerd community.</p>
<p>Our campaign is about bringing The Unlikely Starfighter Video Games and Collectibles to life. We want to create a place people can go to play and discuss games without worry. Both of us are extremely passionate about games and really any other piece of nerd culture we can get our hands on. To be able to create the spot where people can make new memories or even new friends over their favorite games would mean the world to both of us.<br/></p>
<p>By donating to our campaign you will help us make this place a reality and bring it to you. The goal is to open The Unlikely Starfighter Video Games and Collectibles and have it become your game store. A no prejudice center of nerdom where you can hang out, play in a tournament (card games, board games, video games and other) buy, sell and trade or discuss even the oldest of rivalries (looking at you Star Wars vs Star Trek). We want to make a place that will become rooted within the community and with the gamer in all of us.<br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are here to raise $25,000 for our start up. This will go towards such things as </p></span><ol>

<p>As for perks anyone who donates $1.00 - $24.99 will receive a founders membership with the store which means they will have an account with us from day one, free admission to the first tournament of their choosing, and personal thanks by email from the both of us.</p>
<p>Donations of $25.00 - $44.99 will receive a founders membership and account with the store, free admission to the tournament of their choosing, a personal thanks by email plus 100 points will be added to their account to be used as a 5% discount.<br/></p>

<p>I grew up playing the classic RPGs like Phantasy Star, Final Fantasy, and even older ones I could find used, like Bard's Tale. Some of the coolest parts of football, like improving your players and your team, are very similar to an RPG. In Puzzle Football, there are several key RPG elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a set of <b>power cards</b> to take into each game, like magic spells in an RPG.</li>
<li>
<b>Level-up your team</b> to take on stronger teams in cooler stadiums!</li>
<li>
<b>Level-up your players</b> through strategic gameplay.</li>
<li>Earn new <b>Equipment</b> that makes players more powerful. Equip this on players.</li>
<li>Before each match, choose the best players, teams, and power cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like in fantasy football, sometime you want to play football without making a character run around. Puzzle Football is all about the desire to get cool objects and use football strategy.</p>

"" Take the addictive qualities of puzzle games like Bejeweled and Candy Crush, and add in a little more action."" Austin Chronicle


This is Matt from indie studio Part Time Evil, LLC with some fun news about our new game for iPhone, iPad, Android, and more!








To sum up why we're excited: it's puzzle gameplay meets American football action meets role playing game elements.
I grew up playing the classic RPGs like Phantasy Star, Final Fantasy, and even older ones I could find used, like Bard's Tale. Some of the coolest parts of football, like improving your players and your team, are very similar to an RPG. In Puzzle Football, there are several key RPG elements:

Choose a set of power cards to take into each game, like magic spells in an RPG.

Level-up your team to take on stronger teams in cooler stadiums!

Level-up your players through strategic gameplay.
Earn new Equipment that makes players more powerful. Equip this on players.
Before each match, choose the best players, teams, and power cards.

Just like in fantasy football, sometime you want to play football without making a character run around. Puzzle Football is all about the desire to get cool objects and use football strategy.
Help Kids Stay Active
We are donating 5% of this campaign to NFL Play 60 program (specifically, to physical fitness and after-school programs) to help kids stay active. We benefitted from active lifestyles as kids, and we think it's important to give back so all kids have this opportunity.

Hardcore football fans can use football tactics to build the strongest team for a matchup, and to make the right play at the right time.
Puzzle fans who may not know football well are able to enjoy the fast-paced puzzle action.










Choose the right players for the game. Get them equipped with the gear that works best. Choose a deck of powercards.

Decide your best strategy for the play, and try to collect those tiles. For example, if it's 3rd and 10, you probably want to pass. 

Balance the playcalling with the team maintenance. Tiles aren't just for making plays! You need to maintain your line of scrimmage, or you will get dominated! A team with no control over the line of scrimmage loses energy and performs poorly!

Call a play after you get the tiles. Touch the right player to make him do what he does best: pass, long pass, or run!

Use power cards strategically. Just like a magic spell, these things need to recharge!











As of now, we plan to make 20 players for the launch. Players are made in vivid pixel art!
Your team carries a set amount of players. Depending on the matchup, you need to choose the right players. As you can imagine, this really depends on who you are playing, their roster, and their style of play. This is inspired by our love for battle-type card games.





Power cards boost your powers or allow you to do tricks in the game. They are comparable to magic cards in a tabletop game, or magic spells in an RPG video game. Except here, they will affect football powers!
Up the accuracy of your quarterback, freeze all the opponent's tiles for a turn, turn all run tiles into pass tiles to form a pass play....and many, many more! These cards are collectable and unlockable; the farther you progress, the cooler the cards.

Play against your friends in a turn-based game. Right now, we are planning on single player and network turn-based (for friends that are in different cities). Pass-and-play is in our plan if we receive enough funding (great mode for car trips and hanging out with friends).















Glossy football cards. Stay tuned, as well will preview a new one every few days.

This player CANNOT be earned or bought by anyone who does not give to the campaign.  It is exclusive.




We will give you a special code to unlock this team. Imagine how cool it will be to play your friends with a team they can't have!

<div>From the inspirational mind of Hayley DuBay, comes the idea for a game not only beautiful in appearance, but filled with adventure and challenges. Players will be able to create and raise a pack of fantasy wolves, letting them explore new worlds, hunt, fight, protect their den, craft, and learn the ways of survival. </div>
<div>Hayley DuBay is the main artist for this online pet SIM browser game. She has been working hard to build a plausible idea that goes beyond the average pet/adventure game. Now she needs your help.<br/>
</div> <p>This is more than a pet game, this is where your life through the choices you make for your pack. Are you ready to see how strong you can become?</p>

Tier #1: The Unicorn Islands has been UNLOCKED!This offers every player access to these islands, which have different offers of their own compared to the regular game exploration. These islands offer a new Marketplace with new items, a Companion's shop, the Wolf's Pride Colosseum and its daily events to let you test your wolf's skills against other players, The Well of Abundance where you can earn interesting items every Friday depending on how much you donate, and much more!
3 New perks have also been revealed: $8 usd, $15 usd, and $50 usd!



Tier #2:  Mutations and Secrets still is LOCKED!By unlocking this tier you unlock a whole new aspect of the game currently not set in place. Mutations will offer new coats of your wolves and would be achieved randomly. Most mutations will include changes to the eyes, fur type, and pelt coloration. If your wolf is born with a mutation, you can also guarantee a completely different or slightly different pelt color not available in the normal wolves . There will also be breed specific Mutations and even lethal mutations or mutations which could hinder or excell your wolf in gameplay. 
Other secrets within this Tier will include 2 new perks and the Book of Knowledge. This book will be an in-game feature where you can complete achievements to find out information regarding things like prey and predator strengths and weakness, what to avoid or consume in the wild, explore features, wolf features and mutations, and more.

Explore a Beautiful World and Learn the Way of the Wolf:







From the inspirational mind of Hayley DuBay, comes the idea for a game not only beautiful in appearance, but filled with adventure and challenges. Players will be able to create and raise a pack of fantasy wolves, letting them explore new worlds, hunt, fight, protect their den, craft, and learn the ways of survival. 
Hayley DuBay is the main artist for this online pet SIM browser game. She has been working hard to build a plausible idea that goes beyond the average pet/adventure game. Now she needs your help.
 This is more than a pet game, this is where your life through the choices you make for your pack. Are you ready to see how strong you can become?

The New Player - Wolf Selections:

   The Standard = 20 variations

 The Mountain = 14 variations

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Overview</h2>
<p>Guardians of Lumen is an Turn-based RPG in a spanning, huge, and dark fantasy infested with gigantic monsters and secrets.</p>
<p>Players will navigate beautiful environments, and confront sinister foes with the aid of the Ay and the mysterious powers they grant as they keep the 9 strongholds safe.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>EDIT***</h2>
<p> As of January 1st, 2021. this game is no longer an Action-RPG and has been converted into a turn-based RPG (akin to the style of classic Final Fantasy games).<br/>This choice was made after quite a lot of thought and testing was done.</p>
<p>Combat now entails two sides. The player controls the leader of their side while an AI controls both the supporting character and the foes.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Meet The Characters</h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Jiri</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Introducing Jiri Senex, Heir apparent of her Clan in the Tribe of Mist.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605813503/igbeykd8uwqe6fczbmip.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Stoic and to the point, Jiri has grown up in the wastelands and has come to prefer it to the busy and loud nature of the strongholds. Her people are strict and militaristic, with kindness being sidelined for tradition numerous times. This gives her a natural longing for intimacy. She has long silver hair and pale skin. As custom to her tribe, she wears an armour embedded, tight suit which enables her to cloak and hide from both wildlife and monsters. Hanging over her shoulders lays a long trench coat that holds a unique place in her heart.</p>
<p>Few know the true Jiri.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Scythia</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Introducing Scythia Opifex, Tinkerer of the highest order.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605813985/ps2qtuwgz4xscj2zh0sg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>An optimistic genius of a young mechanic born in the Petram Stronghold. Orphaned as a child, she roamed the streets for a few years before being taken in by a mechanic named Brox Opifex and taking his last name at the age of eight (After interrupting a meeting between Master Quaesitor and Brox). She was seen as a prodigy when it came to engineering machinery and tinkering. She’s a lean girl with messy, red hair tied into a long pony-tail. She wears brass gauntlets and boots that are attached to a power supply strapped around her waist. However, she is absolutely powerless whenever she is offered food.</p>
<p>Few can keep up with the mind of Scythia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Dorian</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Introducing Dorian Seco, Captain of Boletus's New Dragoons.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605814293/vdznutbcnkxpog9npic7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>He is a giant of a man, though not as tall as other Giants. He is also of a broad figure, with brass mechanical legs and shaggy hair. Disciplined and brilliant, Dorian was raised by his hero of a father and a brilliant engineering mother. At a young age, (and talked into it by his lover) he stole an Otobai (Motorcycle) meant for a client for his mother. Taking it outside Boletus, he was attacked by a Horror. Dorian managed to escape the creature (losing his legs and his lover’s life in the process). He was saved by his own unfaltering will and returned to the city.</p>
<p>Few can shake the resolve of Dorian.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Afa and Nick</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Introducing the inseparable duo, Afa And Nickolas Laus.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606223478/q8ljh0p6z5a7mhyextdm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Living most of their lives in the underbelly of the Sinefine Stronghold, these two thieves amassed quite the following in their quest to survive. Where Afa has the smoothest, silver tongue, Nick has the sharpest aim. He tends to be dressed in simple leather armour, a black undershirt and a green cloak while she prefers to add a red scarf to the look.</p>
<p>Few understand trust like that of Nick and Afa.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The World Of Lumen</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605819660/fuvhucnwoca9j1iyxiny.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<p>The land of Lumen is, in a word, dark. Giant monsters, Daemons and Horrors, roam the black wastelands while many creatures have adapted away their eyes for more useful senses. None know whether more land exists beyond the waters, for those oceans are rotted to the core, eating away at any that dare touch their murky shores. The sky above is filled with dark, never parting clouds while the land sits nearly barren, requiring much effort to grow even the simplest of plants. Over the centuries, those that survived these harsh environments have created nine strongholds, around naturally defensible areas and anything that shines.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Exploration</h3>
<p>Exploration is key. Materials are scarce in the strongholds. Should you wish to gather materials and craft or strengthen your weapons or gear, exploring every corner of Lumen will become a necessity. </p>
<p>To aid you in doing so, mounts, Ay, and character abilities will have to become like second nature.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are 180 Bunkers in the game.</p>
<p>Bunkers are ancient chambers, remnants of the War of Horrors. The Tribe of Shadows had used them to store treasure and secrets, but with traps and puzzles blocking them off, do you have what it takes to reach their depths?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Strongholds:</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Fullgur</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“The first Stronghold”</p>
<p>Built upon the largest Cryst deposit in Lumen. Located in the Northernmost edge of the map, the Giants that live here adapted to the cold weather through technological advancements, as well as plain grit. The stronghold is ancient, still holding the oldest records and the physically strongest military personnel. It is said that the leaders of Pius fear the elders of Fullgur.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Boletus</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“Empire of the Dragoons”</p>
<p>Founded in the plains where giant, glowing mushrooms light the land. A land of warriors that are indifferent to events outside their domain. The City has tried numerous times to expand their territory but with little success. While they do not oppose the Guardians in any way, few in Boletus share the respect or reverence that the rest of Lumen gives them, instead relying on their Dragoons for protection. A few years before this storyline, Sinefine was annexed by Boletus.  </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Sinefine</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“Fortress of the Undying”</p>
<p>Located in the Southern lowland, around a pit that has been burning for thousands of years. It is said that the best vegetables, meat and Ale comes from Sinefine. When it comes to cooking meals, people from all around Lumen risk the trip to Sinefine to learn from the best. Even the poorest of citizens have the skills of master chefs. To capitalize on this, the government made the hunting grounds and farming lands open for citizen use.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Petram</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""The Fortress of Flames”.</p>
<p>Perched on the Cliffside over a ravine, and carved out by an endless stream of molten rock. A Stronghold of crafters. Due to easily available heat, the people of Petram are master craftsmen and armourers. Citizens here survive by trading goods for food. This, alongside natural defences, has made it nearly impossible for any to attack this stronghold. Petram's good diplomatic relations with near all others, mixed in with their expertise in forging and weaponry keep the people safe and happy.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Inunda</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“The Electric City”</p>
<p>Firmly seated in the land of eternal rain and lightning. This city was built near tall, naturally occurring lightning rods. Unlike all but the Deciphers, the Inundrian people are scholars. The city uses both the constant rain and constant lightning strikes to power nearly everything. While they are not as advanced as the Deciphers, this endless stream of electricity has transformed Inunda into a haven for research and discovery.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Meridi</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“The City of Nature”</p>
<p>Nestled in the tree-tops of the largest forest in Lumen. Giant, tree-like structures illuminate the elf-like city. These people have a deep love for nature. The elders grew up with an elitist mindset, and a seeded racism against the Cinis which created a rift between generations. Their leader is an immortal hailed as their “Goddess”. Due to this belief, however, they have become an isolationist society. They’ve had a bitter relationship with Rupe for years.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Rupe</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“City of Ore”</p>
<p>Placed at the base of a tall cliff. A glowing ore is commonly found around these lands. For decades, the grand city sat safely in the cliffside, overlooking the south eastern lands as they excavated massive amounts of jewels. Rupe was built on the backs of the poor, and indentured slavery. While the middle and upper classes live the most comfortable lives in Lumen, the lower class is hardly ever seen. They’ve had a bitter relationship with Meridi for decades.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Occulta</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“The Hidden City”</p>
<p>Hidden away, at the bottom of a giant lake. A grand staircase, surrounded by glass over three meters thick, leads into the city. While the religious aspects of the Deciphers’ order are run from Pius, it is Occulta which houses and employs most of the greater minds. Protected by water on all sides, few outside the order have made it into Occulta.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Pius</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“The Holy City”</p>
<p>Seated under the one part of the sky that clears at night, once every month. Unlike the other settlements, Pius has no natural defence from the Daemons. Instead, the Light from the two celestial bodies above cuts through the darkness when the clouds part. The grand tower of Asan, the first Decipher, was built under the point where the clouds part.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Mindscapes</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606029845/b9ywi0ropcmtxioyzp7j.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606029879/v9ml9mrjtwmffi55wuid.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unique Constructs representing the minds of the citizens of Lumen. Normally lost, or inaccessible to the common folk but, with a little help, open to Guardians. </p>
<p>When a curse or illness of the mind takes root, there may be a necessity to enter the mind and repair the damage. However, caution must be taken, as the mind does not like the touch of an outsider...</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Races </h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Cinis, Persici, Belua, Giants, Polluit, Ay, Ancient Ones, Horror, Daemons</p> <h3>The Cinis, the Persici, and the Giants</h3> <p>There are three main races on Lumen; The Cinis, the Persici and the Giants.</p>
<p>While the Persici look lean and vibrant, the Cinis are paler, have pointed ears, and tend to have heightened senses. In turn, they are physically weaker. It is said that the Giants are the result of those who survived the War of Horrors, but became trapped beneath the surface. It is said that the higher concentration of oxygen in the catacombs let them evolve to their new size and might.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Belua</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605900296/lesz0yzudinz2ms5kavt.jpg"" src=""""/></h3> <p>The Belua are shorter, and more beastlike than the other three. They tend to exhibit more child-like behaviour, and are slower when it comes to intelligence. Several have fur, tails, claws and whiskers and nearly all stand at half the height of a Cinis or Persici.</p>
<br/><br/> <h3>The Polluits</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605903630/tdzee4uvv7nrhap814as.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Polluit are constructs, repaired and made to serve the Deciphers (though some of the nobles have managed to buy a few of their own). Most were dug up while excavating Pius Tower. Akin to living machines, they were activated using uncovered technologies from the Ancients Ones. They tend to be little more than autonomous Puppets that obey any order, though they show sentience. Many do not believe them to be truly capable or self sufficient. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Ay</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605904779/yxbzxnlpijqrg2aluzfk.png"" src=""""/><p>Spirits that live inside of the Crysts. They are semi-intangible and extremely powerful beings. Requiring a host to survive, the Ay strengthens its partners and are key to the Guardians’ success. They come in many different forms and are practically immortal, though, should their host fall, they may be forced back to their Cryst.</p>
<p>The Ay come in two types, the normal Ay, found nearly anywhere in Lumen, and the Great (aka the Grand) Ay that seem to have power over the others.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Monsters</h3>
<p><strong>Horrors</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606031724/kwwcxxqebnapzmjxppur.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Beasts of nightmares. They take on several, unnatural and grotesque forms. While some range from the size of a small child or water barrel, some tower over houses and have enough strength to crush a giant in an instant. These beasts thrive in the shadows. However, they are not confined to them.</p>
<p>Many a tale exists of Horrors sneaking into strongholds and preying on the citizens, only to be slain by a capable guard or Guardian of course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Daemons</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606075852/mqcbswfk5evnyfpgev4i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The true foes to all sentient life in Lumen. Even the smallest of Daemons tower over all and can level settlements with ease. On the surface, they appear to be large beings, with incredibly thick hide and an unnatural need to kill any that wander too close. However, closer examination has lead to some truly frightening discoveries.</p>
<p>First, there appears to be no digestive tract in any known Daemon type. In fact, none of the 12 known types of Daemons have functioning mouths. Their need to kill stems from some imbedded instinct, rather than necessity of self-preservation.</p>
<p>Next, they seem to be deathly frightened of direct light. Upon discovering a light source, the Daemon will either attempt to destroy it or flee.  This, and the innate effectiveness of light-based attacks has lead some Guardians to link the Daemons and the ever clouded sky. Little in the way of proof has surfaced to support such ideas.</p>
<p>Lastly, and most curiously of all, is their total disregard for wildlife and the Belua race. Minor situations have been recorded where one may have trampled over a horde of Vupus or the like, but these stem from a carelessness on either the side and never over territory, food or malice. </p>
<p>All the research can say for certain is that there remains some secret behind these towering monstrosities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Cryst</h3>
<p>The term “Cryst” is, in truth, a misnomer. While these stones appear similar to crystals at a glance, under careful examination, the Deciphers discovered that they lack a true crystallite structure and resemble more of a neural network-esk pattern up close.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, they were named before being studied.</p>
<p>While it is not fully understood how, Crysts power a majority of machinery, devices and weaponry and have made it possible to fight back against the looming threat of the Horrors. The need for Crysts has expanded into nearly every aspect of day-to-day life in Lumen; from heating one’s home, to combat, to simply lighting a room.</p>
<p>The purest of Crysts are called “Guardian class”, and nearly always come with an Ay looming within. Those Crysts are refined, and bound to Guardians-hence the name-to aid them in their ever-continuing fight against the Horrors.</p>
<p>It is curious, however, that no matter the grade or function, Crysts are neither compatible nor react to the Belua race. This leads scholars and the Deciphers to believe that there is some biological link between the Giants, Cinis and Persici that the Belua simply do not have. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Factions</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Order of the Deciphers</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605918773/f8vw3waypzlc9eh3qerf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The largest research organization in Lumen. For hundreds of years, the Deciphers have worked tirelessly to uncover the secrets of the Ay and the Ancients.</p>
<p>While originally they started as a small group of historians and archeologists, the Order has grown into an almost religious authority, with philosophy and legends taking the focus away from simple research more often than not.</p>
<p>They are based in Pius but have several cathedrals in multiple Strongholds, and tend to be present for many of the festivals and special occasions taking place throughout the year.</p>
<p>Led by the Pontifex and the 6 Cardinals, the order has made it their mission to find a paradise for the citizens of Lumen.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Guardians</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605914441/ijgmsawccgwfymwxjeh7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally a branch of the Deciphers, the Guardians are enhanced warriors that defend the strongholds from Horrors, Daemons and those misguided few that lurk in the shadows.</p>
<p>Each, bound with an Ay, is tasked to aid the people with everything from simple message relays to hunting down towering foes. </p>
<p>Based in Pius but sworn never to uniformly favor one stronghold or group,  many Guardians become drifters, traveling from one settlement to another in search of trouble that needs settling. While several have criticized the Guardians for being too linked to the Deciphers, few would dare wish for a Lumen without them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Merchant Guilds</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605919133/avhxil2jnayvtw1a2le3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Founded after the Boletus-Sinefine War, the Guilds are an organized group of wealthy nobles and merchants ready to defend each other should the need arise. </p>
<p>They were created to ensure fair trade among the strongholds, and to hold merchants accountable for all they do.</p>
<p>Several Guild Halls can be found throughout Lumen, though the headquarters is currently situated in Rupe. These are places where merchants can request aid, bargain, or bring up concerns with fellow merchants.</p>
<p>While not perfect, the guilds believe themselves a critical first step in keeping the citizens of Lumen unified and comfortable.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Wanderers</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605922140/ysaxaquy4l8xnc9t6djq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 7 Tribes of drifting wanderers that explore and live in the shadows of the wastes live apart from the rest of Lumen.</p>
<p>Each tribe contains many clans and thrive in many different areas.</p>
<p>There are the few the roam the shifting Sandlands or the frozen North while others dwell in the southern swamps, fields or woods.</p>
<p>Then there is the tribe that watches over the secrets of Lumen, The Tribe of Mist.</p>
<p>Cold and calculating to outsiders, but willing to step in when needed, these clans slip out of view and can be impossible to find at times.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>These three qualities are the root of every aspect of a person's character in ""Guardians of Lumen"" and it's from these three that all the other stats in the game are derived.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EDIT** </strong></p>
<p><strong>This game is NO LONGER an Action RPG, check the start of the campaign for more information</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Attacks</u></strong></p>
<p>Each of the main characters have their own weapon(s) of choice.</p>
<p>Looking at Jiri's Dual Swords for a moment, combat may only begin when her weapons are drawn.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605927832/avczbedepgawnbhn7xhi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Each Character has their own list of attacks and Chained attacks to be mastered</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For Jiri she has the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Heavy</li>
<li>Light -&gt; Light -&gt; Light</li>
<li>Light -&gt; Heavy -&gt; Heavy </li>
<li>Heavy -&gt; Heavy -&gt; Heavy</li>
</ul>
<p>Should another input be given before her attack is completed, her moves will be chained and a 2nd attack will follow the first.</p>
<p>Each Character has their own list of attacks and Chained attacks to be mastered.</p>
<p>The damage is calculated based on character's strength, elemental modifiers, and weapon strength</p>
<p>Should you forge a better weapon or strengthen the character further, the damage will increase.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Elements</strong></u></p>
<p>The World of Lumen is filled with a unique substance called Cryst that can not only greatly strengthen those that use it but also imbued their weapons with unique elements.</p>
<p>Fire &lt;-&gt; Water</p>
<p>Tera &lt;-&gt; Wind</p>
<p>Electricity &lt;-&gt; Electricity</p>
<p>Light&lt;-&gt; Blight</p>
<p>With the elements in the pair being most effective with each other.</p>
<p>In combat, should you have the opposite element to the element, your damage will be doubled.</p>
<p>Furthermore, should you combine elements, the secondary elements created will have the power of both elements that created it.</p>
<p>By Default, the elemental damage you deal is based on the Cryst imbedded into your character's weapon. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Abilities </strong></u></p>
<p>Each Character has a unique ability all their own that may help in combat, exploration, or in most cases, both.</p>
<p>In Scythia's case, She has the ability to fly freely in the air.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605927272/k010ceb2k0dmdrdgk3wk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Be careful though, these abilities cost Cryst Power. Should that power deplete, the ability will be unavailable for a time.</p>

<p>(A skill tree of an Ay)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ay, the sprites that bind to Guardians, are unique little beings.</p>
<p>Each Ay has a Type;</p>
<ul>
<li>Attack</li>
<li>Defence </li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Exploration</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as an element.</p>
<p>When activated, the character bound to the Ay will gain a boost to some of their stats and have their element overwritten with that of the Ay. Activating an Ay will also increase the body temperature of the character attached. Should you find yourself freezing in the North, an Ay may be able to aid you.</p>
<p>Each Ay also comes with their own skill tree that slowly expands by completing specific tasks in the overworld. The Ay are beings that love to learn and explore and the more they do, the more they develop.</p>

<h3>Breaking it down for folks in more detail:</h3>
<p><strong>$5'200 - Game Is funded</strong><br/>At this level, the game is comfortably funded and should release and keep to schedule. Nothing fancy but it's all we can ask for :D</p>
<p>This money will go into securing the studio space, software/hardware costs, and a small ""Just incase"" fund that, hopefully, will end up just going back into the project.</p>
<p><u>per the 7 months ($5’200) </u><br/>- Secure Access Studio Space ($600)<br/>- Software/ Equipment costs ($100)<br/>- “Just in case” (~$100)<br/>- 5% Indiegogo fees</p>
<p>The Game will, at this point, be released on PC</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <strong>$18'200 - Hire an Animator</strong><br/>With this amount, not only is the game comfortably funded but there should be enough to hire an animator to help with the polish of character animations. </p>
<p><u>3 months ($13’000) </u><br/>- Hire an Animator ($25/h)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <strong>$31'000 - Hire a 2D Artist</strong></p>
<p>With this amount, not only is the game comfortably funded but there should be enough to hire an animator and a 2nd 2D artist to aid with UI and Character art and generally speed up production of the game.</p>
<p><u>3 months ($13’000) </u><br/>- Hire a 2D Artist ($25/h)</p>
<p>The Game will, at this point, be released on PC and Switch</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <strong>$44'000 - Hire a 2nd Modeler</strong><br/>With this amount, along with everything else mentioned, a 2nd modeler with aid in adding more to the characters of the world. At this point, there should be enough members on-board to start adding more secrets to the world and really refining the overall world of Lumen</p>
<p><u>3 months ($13’000) </u><br/>- Hire a 3D Character Modeler ($25/h)</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Greetings :D<br/>I'm Joseph Thamir.</p>
<p>I am a Game Developer based in Canada. I've always been a gamer, I guess. I remember more about the pinball game they had on my grade school computers than the subjects they tried to hammer into me. I love coding (be it in C# or Unreal's blueprints system) and, as humbly as I can put it, I believe I'm pretty good at it. I studied at Durham College for three years as well as took several odd jobs and contract work. I have skills in modelling, rendering, rigging, surfacing, as well as particle effects, but my greatest strength would have to come in as time management. Being skilled would mean nothing if you don't have the time to use those skills, right?<br/>         As a gamer, I'm sadly horrid at shooters and beat-em-ups. Strategy and RPGs are where my heart lies and hopefully, there is where I'll make my mark. First and foremost, I am a story teller, and if I could get my stories out to at least one person, I'd consider the work getting there to be worth it. </p>

Guardians of Lumen is an Turn-based RPG in a spanning, huge, and dark fantasy infested with gigantic monsters and secrets.
Players will navigate beautiful environments, and confront sinister foes with the aid of the Ay and the mysterious powers they grant as they keep the 9 strongholds safe.
 
 
EDIT***
 As of January 1st, 2021. this game is no longer an Action-RPG and has been converted into a turn-based RPG (akin to the style of classic Final Fantasy games).This choice was made after quite a lot of thought and testing was done.
Combat now entails two sides. The player controls the leader of their side while an AI controls both the supporting character and the foes.

 
 
 
Key Gameplay Features

20-30 Hour Base Story
Quests/ Side stories (133 Planned)
Tavern Quests (Endless monster hunts)
Explorations and Bunker Puzzles (180 Planned Bunkers)
Crafting, Enhancing, Cooking, Repairing (Gear and Weapon management at it's finest)
MINIGAMES! (Fishing, Board games and helping around shops)

 
 
 
Meet The Characters
Jiri
 
Introducing Jiri Senex, Heir apparent of her Clan in the Tribe of Mist.

Stoic and to the point, Jiri has grown up in the wastelands and has come to prefer it to the busy and loud nature of the strongholds. Her people are strict and militaristic, with kindness being sidelined for tradition numerous times. This gives her a natural longing for intimacy. She has long silver hair and pale skin. As custom to her tribe, she wears an armour embedded, tight suit which enables her to cloak and hide from both wildlife and monsters. Hanging over her shoulders lays a long trench coat that holds a unique place in her heart.
Few know the true Jiri.
 
 
Scythia
 
Introducing Scythia Opifex, Tinkerer of the highest order.

An optimistic genius of a young mechanic born in the Petram Stronghold. Orphaned as a child, she roamed the streets for a few years before being taken in by a mechanic named Brox Opifex and taking his last name at the age of eight (After interrupting a meeting between Master Quaesitor and Brox). She was seen as a prodigy when it came to engineering machinery and tinkering. She’s a lean girl with messy, red hair tied into a long pony-tail. She wears brass gauntlets and boots that are attached to a power supply strapped around her waist. However, she is absolutely powerless whenever she is offered food.
Few can keep up with the mind of Scythia.
 
 
Dorian
 
Introducing Dorian Seco, Captain of Boletus's New Dragoons.

He is a giant of a man, though not as tall as other Giants. He is also of a broad figure, with brass mechanical legs and shaggy hair. Disciplined and brilliant, Dorian was raised by his hero of a father and a brilliant engineering mother. At a young age, (and talked into it by his lover) he stole an Otobai (Motorcycle) meant for a client for his mother. Taking it outside Boletus, he was attacked by a Horror. Dorian managed to escape the creature (losing his legs and his lover’s life in the process). He was saved by his own unfaltering will and returned to the city.
Few can shake the resolve of Dorian.
 
Afa and Nick
 
Introducing the inseparable duo, Afa And Nickolas Laus.

Living most of their lives in the underbelly of the Sinefine Stronghold, these two thieves amassed quite the following in their quest to survive. Where Afa has the smoothest, silver tongue, Nick has the sharpest aim. He tends to be dressed in simple leather armour, a black undershirt and a green cloak while she prefers to add a red scarf to the look.
Few understand trust like that of Nick and Afa.
 
 
 
The World Of Lumen
 

 
The land of Lumen is, in a word, dark. Giant monsters, Daemons and Horrors, roam the black wastelands while many creatures have adapted away their eyes for more useful senses. None know whether more land exists beyond the waters, for those oceans are rotted to the core, eating away at any that dare touch their murky shores. The sky above is filled with dark, never parting clouds while the land sits nearly barren, requiring much effort to grow even the simplest of plants. Over the centuries, those that survived these harsh environments have created nine strongholds, around naturally defensible areas and anything that shines.
 
Exploration
Exploration is key. Materials are scarce in the strongholds. Should you wish to gather materials and craft or strengthen your weapons or gear, exploring every corner of Lumen will become a necessity. 
To aid you in doing so, mounts, Ay, and character abilities will have to become like second nature.
Furthermore, there are 180 Bunkers in the game.
Bunkers are ancient chambers, remnants of the War of Horrors. The Tribe of Shadows had used them to store treasure and secrets, but with traps and puzzles blocking them off, do you have what it takes to reach their depths?
 
 
The Strongholds:
 
Fullgur
“The first Stronghold”
Built upon the largest Cryst deposit in Lumen. Located in the Northernmost edge of the map, the Giants that live here adapted to the cold weather through technological advancements, as well as plain grit. The stronghold is ancient, still holding the oldest records and the physically strongest military personnel. It is said that the leaders of Pius fear the elders of Fullgur.
 
Boletus
“Empire of the Dragoons”
Founded in the plains where giant, glowing mushrooms light the land. A land of warriors that are indifferent to events outside their domain. The City has tried numerous times to expand their territory but with little success. While they do not oppose the Guardians in any way, few in Boletus share the respect or reverence that the rest of Lumen gives them, instead relying on their Dragoons for protection. A few years before this storyline, Sinefine was annexed by Boletus.  
 
Sinefine
“Fortress of the Undying”
Located in the Southern lowland, around a pit that has been burning for thousands of years. It is said that the best vegetables, meat and Ale comes from Sinefine. When it comes to cooking meals, people from all around Lumen risk the trip to Sinefine to learn from the best. Even the poorest of citizens have the skills of master chefs. To capitalize on this, the government made the hunting grounds and farming lands open for citizen use.
 
Petram
""The Fortress of Flames”.
Perched on the Cliffside over a ravine, and carved out by an endless stream of molten rock. A Stronghold of crafters. Due to easily available heat, the people of Petram are master craftsmen and armourers. Citizens here survive by trading goods for food. This, alongside natural defences, has made it nearly impossible for any to attack this stronghold. Petram's good diplomatic relations with near all others, mixed in with their expertise in forging and weaponry keep the people safe and happy.
 
Inunda
“The Electric City”
Firmly seated in the land of eternal rain and lightning. This city was built near tall, naturally occurring lightning rods. Unlike all but the Deciphers, the Inundrian people are scholars. The city uses both the constant rain and constant lightning strikes to power nearly everything. While they are not as advanced as the Deciphers, this endless stream of electricity has transformed Inunda into a haven for research and discovery.
 
Meridi
“The City of Nature”
Nestled in the tree-tops of the largest forest in Lumen. Giant, tree-like structures illuminate the elf-like city. These people have a deep love for nature. The elders grew up with an elitist mindset, and a seeded racism against the Cinis which created a rift between generations. Their leader is an immortal hailed as their “Goddess”. Due to this belief, however, they have become an isolationist society. They’ve had a bitter relationship with Rupe for years.
 
Rupe
“City of Ore”
Placed at the base of a tall cliff. A glowing ore is commonly found around these lands. For decades, the grand city sat safely in the cliffside, overlooking the south eastern lands as they excavated massive amounts of jewels. Rupe was built on the backs of the poor, and indentured slavery. While the middle and upper classes live the most comfortable lives in Lumen, the lower class is hardly ever seen. They’ve had a bitter relationship with Meridi for decades.
 
Occulta
“The Hidden City”
Hidden away, at the bottom of a giant lake. A grand staircase, surrounded by glass over three meters thick, leads into the city. While the religious aspects of the Deciphers’ order are run from Pius, it is Occulta which houses and employs most of the greater minds. Protected by water on all sides, few outside the order have made it into Occulta.
 
Pius
“The Holy City”
Seated under the one part of the sky that clears at night, once every month. Unlike the other settlements, Pius has no natural defence from the Daemons. Instead, the Light from the two celestial bodies above cuts through the darkness when the clouds part. The grand tower of Asan, the first Decipher, was built under the point where the clouds part.
 
The Mindscapes

 

 
Unique Constructs representing the minds of the citizens of Lumen. Normally lost, or inaccessible to the common folk but, with a little help, open to Guardians. 
When a curse or illness of the mind takes root, there may be a necessity to enter the mind and repair the damage. However, caution must be taken, as the mind does not like the touch of an outsider...
 
Races 
Cinis, Persici, Belua, Giants, Polluit, Ay, Ancient Ones, Horror, Daemons The Cinis, the Persici, and the Giants There are three main races on Lumen; The Cinis, the Persici and the Giants.
While the Persici look lean and vibrant, the Cinis are paler, have pointed ears, and tend to have heightened senses. In turn, they are physically weaker. It is said that the Giants are the result of those who survived the War of Horrors, but became trapped beneath the surface. It is said that the higher concentration of oxygen in the catacombs let them evolve to their new size and might.
 
 
The Belua
 
 The Belua are shorter, and more beastlike than the other three. They tend to exhibit more child-like behaviour, and are slower when it comes to intelligence. Several have fur, tails, claws and whiskers and nearly all stand at half the height of a Cinis or Persici.
 The Polluits

The Polluit are constructs, repaired and made to serve the Deciphers (though some of the nobles have managed to buy a few of their own). Most were dug up while excavating Pius Tower. Akin to living machines, they were activated using uncovered technologies from the Ancients Ones. They tend to be little more than autonomous Puppets that obey any order, though they show sentience. Many do not believe them to be truly capable or self sufficient. 
 
 
The Ay
Spirits that live inside of the Crysts. They are semi-intangible and extremely powerful beings. Requiring a host to survive, the Ay strengthens its partners and are key to the Guardians’ success. They come in many different forms and are practically immortal, though, should their host fall, they may be forced back to their Cryst.
The Ay come in two types, the normal Ay, found nearly anywhere in Lumen, and the Great (aka the Grand) Ay that seem to have power over the others.
 
Monsters
Horrors

Beasts of nightmares. They take on several, unnatural and grotesque forms. While some range from the size of a small child or water barrel, some tower over houses and have enough strength to crush a giant in an instant. These beasts thrive in the shadows. However, they are not confined to them.
Many a tale exists of Horrors sneaking into strongholds and preying on the citizens, only to be slain by a capable guard or Guardian of course.
 
Daemons

The true foes to all sentient life in Lumen. Even the smallest of Daemons tower over all and can level settlements with ease. On the surface, they appear to be large beings, with incredibly thick hide and an unnatural need to kill any that wander too close. However, closer examination has lead to some truly frightening discoveries.
First, there appears to be no digestive tract in any known Daemon type. In fact, none of the 12 known types of Daemons have functioning mouths. Their need to kill stems from some imbedded instinct, rather than necessity of self-preservation.
Next, they seem to be deathly frightened of direct light. Upon discovering a light source, the Daemon will either attempt to destroy it or flee.  This, and the innate effectiveness of light-based attacks has lead some Guardians to link the Daemons and the ever clouded sky. Little in the way of proof has surfaced to support such ideas.
Lastly, and most curiously of all, is their total disregard for wildlife and the Belua race. Minor situations have been recorded where one may have trampled over a horde of Vupus or the like, but these stem from a carelessness on either the side and never over territory, food or malice. 
All the research can say for certain is that there remains some secret behind these towering monstrosities. 
 
 
Cryst
The term “Cryst” is, in truth, a misnomer. While these stones appear similar to crystals at a glance, under careful examination, the Deciphers discovered that they lack a true crystallite structure and resemble more of a neural network-esk pattern up close.
But nevertheless, they were named before being studied.
While it is not fully understood how, Crysts power a majority of machinery, devices and weaponry and have made it possible to fight back against the looming threat of the Horrors. The need for Crysts has expanded into nearly every aspect of day-to-day life in Lumen; from heating one’s home, to combat, to simply lighting a room.
The purest of Crysts are called “Guardian class”, and nearly always come with an Ay looming within. Those Crysts are refined, and bound to Guardians-hence the name-to aid them in their ever-continuing fight against the Horrors.
It is curious, however, that no matter the grade or function, Crysts are neither compatible nor react to the Belua race. This leads scholars and the Deciphers to believe that there is some biological link between the Giants, Cinis and Persici that the Belua simply do not have. 
 
Factions
 
Order of the Deciphers

The largest research organization in Lumen. For hundreds of years, the Deciphers have worked tirelessly to uncover the secrets of the Ay and the Ancients.
While originally they started as a small group of historians and archeologists, the Order has grown into an almost religious authority, with philosophy and legends taking the focus away from simple research more often than not.
They are based in Pius but have several cathedrals in multiple Strongholds, and tend to be present for many of the festivals and special occasions taking place throughout the year.
Led by the Pontifex and the 6 Cardinals, the order has made it their mission to find a paradise for the citizens of Lumen.
 
The Guardians

 
Originally a branch of the Deciphers, the Guardians are enhanced warriors that defend the strongholds from Horrors, Daemons and those misguided few that lurk in the shadows.
Each, bound with an Ay, is tasked to aid the people with everything from simple message relays to hunting down towering foes. 
Based in Pius but sworn never to uniformly favor one stronghold or group,  many Guardians become drifters, traveling from one settlement to another in search of trouble that needs settling. While several have criticized the Guardians for being too linked to the Deciphers, few would dare wish for a Lumen without them. 
 
 
The Merchant Guilds

Founded after the Boletus-Sinefine War, the Guilds are an organized group of wealthy nobles and merchants ready to defend each other should the need arise. 
They were created to ensure fair trade among the strongholds, and to hold merchants accountable for all they do.
Several Guild Halls can be found throughout Lumen, though the headquarters is currently situated in Rupe. These are places where merchants can request aid, bargain, or bring up concerns with fellow merchants.
While not perfect, the guilds believe themselves a critical first step in keeping the citizens of Lumen unified and comfortable.
 
The Wanderers
 

 
The 7 Tribes of drifting wanderers that explore and live in the shadows of the wastes live apart from the rest of Lumen.
Each tribe contains many clans and thrive in many different areas.
There are the few the roam the shifting Sandlands or the frozen North while others dwell in the southern swamps, fields or woods.
Then there is the tribe that watches over the secrets of Lumen, The Tribe of Mist.
Cold and calculating to outsiders, but willing to step in when needed, these clans slip out of view and can be impossible to find at times.
 
 
 
Combat*
EDIT** 
This game is NO LONGER an Action RPG, check the start of the campaign for more information
 
Basics
Stats
 Mind: The Mental capability of the Character.
 Body: The Physical Strength of the Character.
Soul: The Strength of the Character's Will and Resolve.
 
 
 
These three qualities are the root of every aspect of a person's character in ""Guardians of Lumen"" and it's from these three that all the other stats in the game are derived.
 
EDIT** 
This game is NO LONGER an Action RPG, check the start of the campaign for more information
Attacks
Each of the main characters have their own weapon(s) of choice.
Looking at Jiri's Dual Swords for a moment, combat may only begin when her weapons are drawn.

Each Character has their own list of attacks and Chained attacks to be mastered
 
For Jiri she has the following:

Light
Heavy
Light -> Light -> Light
Light -> Heavy -> Heavy 
Heavy -> Heavy -> Heavy

Should another input be given before her attack is completed, her moves will be chained and a 2nd attack will follow the first.
Each Character has their own list of attacks and Chained attacks to be mastered.
The damage is calculated based on character's strength, elemental modifiers, and weapon strength
Should you forge a better weapon or strengthen the character further, the damage will increase.
 
Elements
The World of Lumen is filled with a unique substance called Cryst that can not only greatly strengthen those that use it but also imbued their weapons with unique elements.
Fire <-> Water
Tera <-> Wind
Electricity <-> Electricity
Light<-> Blight
With the elements in the pair being most effective with each other.
In combat, should you have the opposite element to the element, your damage will be doubled.
Furthermore, should you combine elements, the secondary elements created will have the power of both elements that created it.
By Default, the elemental damage you deal is based on the Cryst imbedded into your character's weapon. 
 
 
Abilities 
Each Character has a unique ability all their own that may help in combat, exploration, or in most cases, both.
In Scythia's case, She has the ability to fly freely in the air.

Be careful though, these abilities cost Cryst Power. Should that power deplete, the ability will be unavailable for a time.

The Ay System
 

(A skill tree of an Ay)
 
 
Ay, the sprites that bind to Guardians, are unique little beings.
Each Ay has a Type;

Attack
Defence 
Speed
Exploration

As well as an element.
When activated, the character bound to the Ay will gain a boost to some of their stats and have their element overwritten with that of the Ay. Activating an Ay will also increase the body temperature of the character attached. Should you find yourself freezing in the North, an Ay may be able to aid you.
Each Ay also comes with their own skill tree that slowly expands by completing specific tasks in the overworld. The Ay are beings that love to learn and explore and the more they do, the more they develop.
 
Soundtrack

The OST was entirely created by me (Joseph) from scratch and with little to no formal training. All-in-all, I am pretty proud with how it turned out.

Stretch Goals (& What You Get)
 

Breaking it down for folks in more detail:
$5'200 - Game Is fundedAt this level, the game is comfortably funded and should release and keep to schedule. Nothing fancy but it's all we can ask for :D
This money will go into securing the studio space, software/hardware costs, and a small ""Just incase"" fund that, hopefully, will end up just going back into the project.
per the 7 months ($5’200) - Secure Access Studio Space ($600)- Software/ Equipment costs ($100)- “Just in case” (~$100)- 5% Indiegogo fees
The Game will, at this point, be released on PC
 
 $18'200 - Hire an AnimatorWith this amount, not only is the game comfortably funded but there should be enough to hire an animator to help with the polish of character animations. 
3 months ($13’000) - Hire an Animator ($25/h)
 
 $31'000 - Hire a 2D Artist
With this amount, not only is the game comfortably funded but there should be enough to hire an animator and a 2nd 2D artist to aid with UI and Character art and generally speed up production of the game.
3 months ($13’000) - Hire a 2D Artist ($25/h)
The Game will, at this point, be released on PC and Switch
 
 $44'000 - Hire a 2nd ModelerWith this amount, along with everything else mentioned, a 2nd modeler with aid in adding more to the characters of the world. At this point, there should be enough members on-board to start adding more secrets to the world and really refining the overall world of Lumen
3 months ($13’000) - Hire a 3D Character Modeler ($25/h)
 

About Me
 
Greetings :DI'm Joseph Thamir.
I am a Game Developer based in Canada. I've always been a gamer, I guess. I remember more about the pinball game they had on my grade school computers than the subjects they tried to hammer into me. I love coding (be it in C# or Unreal's blueprints system) and, as humbly as I can put it, I believe I'm pretty good at it. I studied at Durham College for three years as well as took several odd jobs and contract work. I have skills in modelling, rendering, rigging, surfacing, as well as particle effects, but my greatest strength would have to come in as time management. Being skilled would mean nothing if you don't have the time to use those skills, right?         As a gamer, I'm sadly horrid at shooters and beat-em-ups. Strategy and RPGs are where my heart lies and hopefully, there is where I'll make my mark. First and foremost, I am a story teller, and if I could get my stories out to at least one person, I'd consider the work getting there to be worth it.

<h3>Here's what you need to know about this project!</h3>
<p>I have always loved video games, but what I enjoy more is how they bring people together. Over the past 8 years, I have had the privilege of making hundreds of gaming videos and races, with friends, gaining around 100 million views. Now, I am evolving with the knowledge I learned to create a new era for Versus!</p>
<p>My goal for version 2.0 of my Youtube channel, Versus, is to make a channel that features new shows and videos with higher production value, more interesting ideas, and include new, talented people! In order to do this, I started an event called Versus Expo to bring people together to collaborate and do things much larger than what we can do from home alone over Discord.</p>
<p>This project is important to me because gaming saved my life, and the friends and community I made along the way have given me a new life and purpose that I would have never dreamed of. Through this project, I want to be able to provide a community that works with and cares for one another, and have us all come together for a great charitable cause! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is the money that's donated going towards?</h3>
<p>In order to pursue some of the ideas I have, I'm going to need some financial assistance. The money donated will go towards: </p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment; Sound Board, Microphones, Cameras, Speakers, and Lights</li>
<li>Wages for editors and artists</li>
<li>Hotel and event costs for Versus Expo</li>
</ul>
<p>If we can't reach our goal, I will still be grateful for the help and continue pursuing these new ideas. Financial assistance will allow me to get there more quickly and efficiently! </p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goals!</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Thanks to your generosity, we reached our base goal! We now have two stretch goals for the campaign!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The first stretch goal is for $7500. If we reach this, I will invest that money into hiring a part time editor to help assist with the workload of future versus content as I move into version 2.0!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The second stretch goal is for $10,000! If we reach this goal, I will begin working towards having VSX be biannual with the second location occuring in the Winter on the west coast in the Los Angles area.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What can you receive for donating?</h3>
<p>We have several tiers you can donate at, every dollar helps in crowd-funding so everything is appreciated! </p>
<p>$5 - Special Thanks - Special thanks on the website with your name</p>
<p>$10 - Minecraft Server - You can access our Versus Expo Minecraft server where we'll have organized games and events all weekend!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact of Versus Expo will be powerful!</h3>
<p>Versus Expo will eventually have the ability to help millions around the world! Here's how!</p>
<ul>
<li>The main focus of the VSX Show is to raise money for charity! Our charity sponsor this year is Save the Children, which improves the lives of children through better education, health care, and economic opportunities, as well as providing emergency aid in natural disasters, war, and other conflicts.</li>
<li>This event will give the let's players, streamers, and online gamers a location to build up a strong community by coming together to have a ton of fun, make friends, host a cool event, and raise money for a good cause!</li>
<li>We'll potentially provide jobs and opportunities to many within this industry as we continue to grow!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are a lot of risks and challenges that come with running an event and doing something of this size. Here's some reasons why I'm qualified to pursue this dream!</p>
<ul>
<li>I hosted our first event VSX2019 last year with a minimal budget to prove how dedicated I am to making all of this work. I wanted to prove myself before I asked my audience and the internet for an investment</li>
<li>I've been an active part of this community for nearly 9 years now and know the ins and outs of a ton of aspects</li>
<li>Hosted Versus panels at PAX East and West to test out ideas in front of crowds</li>
<li>Assisted and implemented a lot of ideas at TRG Colosseum, another charity event I assist my friends with.</li>
<li>Traveled to and volunteered at several conventions to build up experience and knowledge.</li>
<li>Received a degree in electronic media entertainment and took several business courses in college</li>

I have always loved video games, but what I enjoy more is how they bring people together. Over the past 8 years, I have had the privilege of making hundreds of gaming videos and races, with friends, gaining around 100 million views. Now, I am evolving with the knowledge I learned to create a new era for Versus!
My goal for version 2.0 of my Youtube channel, Versus, is to make a channel that features new shows and videos with higher production value, more interesting ideas, and include new, talented people! In order to do this, I started an event called Versus Expo to bring people together to collaborate and do things much larger than what we can do from home alone over Discord.
This project is important to me because gaming saved my life, and the friends and community I made along the way have given me a new life and purpose that I would have never dreamed of. Through this project, I want to be able to provide a community that works with and cares for one another, and have us all come together for a great charitable cause! 

What is the money that's donated going towards?
In order to pursue some of the ideas I have, I'm going to need some financial assistance. The money donated will go towards: 

Equipment; Sound Board, Microphones, Cameras, Speakers, and Lights
Wages for editors and artists
Hotel and event costs for Versus Expo

If we can't reach our goal, I will still be grateful for the help and continue pursuing these new ideas. Financial assistance will allow me to get there more quickly and efficiently! 
Stretch Goals!
Thanks to your generosity, we reached our base goal! We now have two stretch goals for the campaign!
The first stretch goal is for $7500. If we reach this, I will invest that money into hiring a part time editor to help assist with the workload of future versus content as I move into version 2.0!
The second stretch goal is for $10,000! If we reach this goal, I will begin working towards having VSX be biannual with the second location occuring in the Winter on the west coast in the Los Angles area.
 
What can you receive for donating?
We have several tiers you can donate at, every dollar helps in crowd-funding so everything is appreciated! 
$5 - Special Thanks - Special thanks on the website with your name
$10 - Minecraft Server - You can access our Versus Expo Minecraft server where we'll have organized games and events all weekend!
$25 - Thank you card - I will write you a hand-written thank you note for your contribution
$50 - Exclusive VSX2020 T-shirt
$75 - Private Discord Call - After VSX I will have a Discord call with you for 10-15 minutes to talk about whatever you want, answer questions, and give content creation tips! 

The Impact of Versus Expo will be powerful!
Versus Expo will eventually have the ability to help millions around the world! Here's how!

The main focus of the VSX Show is to raise money for charity! Our charity sponsor this year is Save the Children, which improves the lives of children through better education, health care, and economic opportunities, as well as providing emergency aid in natural disasters, war, and other conflicts.
This event will give the let's players, streamers, and online gamers a location to build up a strong community by coming together to have a ton of fun, make friends, host a cool event, and raise money for a good cause!
We'll potentially provide jobs and opportunities to many within this industry as we continue to grow!


Risks & Challenges
There are a lot of risks and challenges that come with running an event and doing something of this size. Here's some reasons why I'm qualified to pursue this dream!

I hosted our first event VSX2019 last year with a minimal budget to prove how dedicated I am to making all of this work. I wanted to prove myself before I asked my audience and the internet for an investment
I've been an active part of this community for nearly 9 years now and know the ins and outs of a ton of aspects
Hosted Versus panels at PAX East and West to test out ideas in front of crowds
Assisted and implemented a lot of ideas at TRG Colosseum, another charity event I assist my friends with.
Traveled to and volunteered at several conventions to build up experience and knowledge.
Received a degree in electronic media entertainment and took several business courses in college


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute financially, it's okay! There's lots of other ways you can help us on our journey! 

Tell your friends, both online and in real life about the event and about what we're doing! Spread the word! 
Use the Indiegogo share tools to share our campaign on social media such as Twitter and Facebook.
Watch our livestream on July 10 - 12 at http://www.youtube.com/versus


We're having several segments this year where attendees will be able to participate in certain events and races. I do have a few open time slots this year though that I wanted to keep open for submissions! Fill out the following form to submit your idea for a race at VSX2020! https://forms.gle/KyfTzsPx862Uws1H7
VOLUNTEER SIGN UP FORM: Yes! We'll need more volunteers online and on-site! If you're interested, fill out the following form. https://forms.gle/adTAyrHbbRckc35a9",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>Hey, everyone, I am Sergey Lipskiy, the author of GLideN64. GLideN64 is advanced multi-platform open-source graphics plugin for N64 emulators. It uses powerful features of modern GPUs to bring you new level of quality and authenticity of hardware-based emulation on desktops and mobile platforms. The project’s first public version was released in 2015. It became possible after successful <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gliden64-graphics-plugin#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">campaign</a> here, on Indiegogo, in 2014. Since that time the project lives on <a href=""https://github.com/gonetz/GLideN64"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GitHub</a>. Current public version <a href=""http://gliden64.blogspot.ru/2016/12/public-release-20.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">released</a> at the end of 2016. Development continues, current work-in-progress builds also available for <a href=""https://github.com/gonetz/GLideN64/issues/1364"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">download </a>on GitHub.</p>
<h3>Progress</h3>
<p>Since the first release GLideN64 became the most advanced graphics plugin for N64 emulators. Project’s progress never stopped, so it evolved greatly since the first release. The plugin reproduces on modern hardware most of features and capabilities of original console, thus adding authenticity to more and more titles. For example, fixed point arithmetics used by N64 hardware can result in interesting color wrapping effects, which never happen on PC hardware. I added special shaders to emulate that effect in GLideN64 and that changed familiar look of games, which used be be known as fully emulated:</p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499099570/r26b02zaeqrapdjbvyb6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This is just one illustration of hundreds of fixes made during project development.</p>
<p>Another direction for project advance is High Level Emulation (HLE) of games, which either use custom RSP microcode or custom modifications of standard microcodes and thus require Low Level Emulation (LLE) to work correctly. Microcode is microprogram running on programmable Reality Signal Processor (RSP) chip, which handles some audio and most video pre-processing of the N64. Reverse engineering of microcode’s code is necessary for HLE implementation. It is hard task, which not everyone can do. Olivieryuyu, main beta tester of GlideN64, and me have taken this task seriously and together achieved several successful results. First, we added HLE support for “64 de Hakken!! Tamagotchi Minna de Tamagotchi World”. Recently new difficulty level was taken: HLE implementation of <a href=""http://gliden64.blogspot.ru/2017/06/toukon-road-1-2-last-legion-ux-hle.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">T3DUX microcode</a>, used for three games: Last Legion UX, Shin Nihon Pro Wrestling Toukon Road - Brave Spirits and Shin Nihon Pro Wrestling Toukon Road 2 - The Next Generation.</p>

<h3>Campaign</h3>
<p>There are many directions for project’s further progress. Most of problems, which need to be solved, are hard and require many time for completion. Since I work on the project in my spare time, I don’t have time for all tasks. I have to choose, which task to take next. One of the most ambitious tasks is HLE support for one of the best N64 titles: Star Wars - Rogue Squadron. This game uses custom microcode developed by Factor 5, a well known developer to have some of best game programmers of its time. The only known attempt to make HLE implementation for this microcode was taken many years ago by Lemmy, the author of graphics plugin for <a href=""http://nemu.emuunlim.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nemu</a> emulator. Lemmy’s implementation is very incomplete: terrain geometry is missing, many texture errors and other glitches. Olivieryuyu investigated the microcode and found that it is probably most complex and definitely largest one. It has a large and complex part of its code dedicated to generate terrain polygons on fly. We started microcode implementation and advanced further than Lemmy: texture mapping is correctly implemented, fog is fixed, simplest part of terrain generation code is implemented too. Currently HLE version of the game looks like this:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499099887/jjb6xgeg77eokcntavf7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>I need to implement remained part of microcode and fix various issues with frame buffer emulation in this game. It is hard task, and it would require a huge effort to get it done. I need your support and encouragement to complete it. The campaign is short and has minimal allowed goal. It is not price for completion of this task, since I work for free. It is motivation bonus. If campaign will reach the goal, the task will get top priority. I’ll complete it as soon as possible, taken into account my limited time resources.<br/> </p>
<h3>Plan for Project Completion</h3>
<p>The plan is simple. I implement microcode step by step. When all code will be ready, I will fix issues with frame buffer emulation and do other required polishing. Source code will go to master branch, binary build will be released for supported desktop platforms. Update of mobile version usually happens soon after master branch update.</p>
<p>Time-line estimation: I started to work on this microcode in top-priority mode and it took circa a month to reach the current state. Remained part of microcode will take another two month, as it is really complex part. Few weeks will take bug-fixing and frame buffer emulation. Thus, project completion requires circa three months of work after reaching the campaign goal.<br/> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p>The challenge is obvious: this is “mission impossible” kind of tasks. But don’t worry. olivieryuyu and me already decoded many microcode mysteries.

All players are asking us to add Ranger class and how kick-ass it would be for that class to tame beasts and use as combat pets. We agree with those players.
 

Note: Range class will be added only if we reach our goal. If compaign does not reach the goal we will use money collected for developing other game features.",7.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>A role-playing game (RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting, or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.</p>
<p>A tabletop role-playing game is a form of RPG in which the players describe their characters' actions through speech. Players determine the actions of their characters based on their characterization, and the actions succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. Within the rules, players have the freedom to improvise; their choices shape the direction and outcome of the game.</p>
<p>Unlike other types of role-playing game, tabletop RPGs are often conducted like radio drama: only the spoken component of a role is acted. This acting is not always literal, and players do not always speak exclusively in-character. Instead, players act out their role by deciding and describing what actions their characters will take within the rules of the game. In most games, a specially designated player called the game master (GM) creates a setting in which each player plays the role of a single character. The GM describes the game world and its inhabitants; the other players describe the intended actions of their characters, and the GM describes the outcomes. Some outcomes are determined by the game system, and some are chosen by the GM.</p>
<p>The terms pen-and-paper and tabletop are generally only used to distinguish this format of RPG from other formats, since neither pen and paper nor a table are strictly necessary.</p>

<p><strong>S.A.G.A.'s system is based on the collaudated d100 lower rolls win</strong>, in games like <em>WFRP, Stormbringer </em>or<em> Call of Cthulhu</em>. The simplycity, flexibility and immediacy are innate to the system but they aren't the only strenght.</p>
<p><strong>S.A.G.A. has been created by masters for masters</strong> and that make as easy as pie to balance its sistem without much thinking for an expert master and easy also for a beginner master who will non be forced to lose hour searching between manuals full of rules and quibbles.</p>
<p>S.A.G.A. is one on the few manuals which<strong> system let you personalize completely your character</strong>: the character's evolution follow the player's game style allowing a realistic developping for both <em>Characteristic</em> (that can be physic and mental attributes) and <em>Skills</em>.</p>
<p>In S.A.G.A. Characteristics' scores grow proportionally at the kind of tests the character will face: a chatacter who will trow himself often in a combat will make grow faster his combat ability, at the opposite a fine strategist will make grow faster his intelligence score (simply chosing to take different approach to the problem and so facing different tests).</p>
<p>A S.A.G.A. character as well as his/her Characteristic had <em>Skills</em> and <em>Talents</em>: technical skills and specific knowledges that became very useful during the quest and will help the master decide if a character can do or not do a certain action.</p>
<p>In S.A.G.A. doesn't exist the ""<em>Classes</em>"" we have <em>Archetypes</em> instead. Archetypes are the guidelines fot the character's works (what was his/her work before became an adventurer) but, differently from Classes of other RPG, the Archetypes doesn't bind the player's interpretation on preset stereotype.</p>
<p><strong>Combats in S.A.G.A are throught to be very dynamic</strong> so a Master can manage both swords combats between medieval warrrios and shootings between 30's gangster and their Thompson machine guns. The system has been created to be flexible and fluid to let the players manage their resources at best and let them adapt their action to the battle's flow, like in a real fight!</p>
<p>In the Core Manual of S.A.G.A there<strong> are also included a lot of variables for combat's rules</strong>, so the Game Master can choose which one is more adapt at his/her game style, from those specifics for pure combat - like the <em>Minions' rule</em> (nameless opponents with only one lifepoint, most likely many of them will be present at once) - or more stategy rules - like the possibility to use different kind of armor for the different body zones, which make fondamental the blow's target choise - till the rules about flight fights and the use of miniatures!</p>
<p>Differently from most RPG, S.A.G.A has simple and intuitive rules also for manage transports and their use in combats.To help Masters create their unique adventures S.A.G.A contain also a compelling list of <strong>weapons and transports sort by historical period</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>One of the most blatant news introduced by S.A.G.A is the <em>Karma</em></strong>, a points resource who let the players influence in a direct way both the game and the dice-rolls. Depending on how many points a players uses, Karma allow to repeat a dice-roll, make an action even if isn't their turn, have an automatic success to a test or save their character life.</p>
<p>When Karma point are finished (at 0) they can still be utilizated to influence story and dice-rolls, but the character will go against a fate retortion... So<em><strong> Karma is a powerful resource for players and Game Masters both!</strong></em></p>
<p>For horror and psychological adventures' lovers S.A.G.A came with the <strong>Mental Sanity's rules set</strong> and many mental sickness tuned for be played.</p>

<p>Avalanche is a 3D first person survival simulator in the development stage  by Xenarch Gaming. </p>
<h3> <strong>You must survive and we all know, only the toughest survive.</strong>
</h3>
<p>To survive in Avalanche not only do you need to eat, drink and keep warm by your fire and shelter; you're faced with storms, torrential downpour of rain and snow, plus the fear of the next avalanche, which could come at any moment. Chopping trees and throwing them in the fire will keep you warm, but in some scenarios it will come down to:</p>
<p>""Do I make a fire or something to protect myself""</p>
<p>""Do I kill this deer or wait for wolves to leave me scraps?""</p>
<p>Starting with a knife made from a rabbits ribcage and vines you have the necessary tools to expand, making axes, bows and arrows, shovels, traps &amp; shelters. All the tools you need to survive in this ever changing survival simulator.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Base Structures </h3>
<p>Xenarch Gaming is very proud to announce Avalanches newest feature ""Dynamic Base Structures"" (or DBS for short) </p>

<p>Dynamic Base Structures will come into great use with both PvE (Player Versus Environment) &amp; PvP (Player Versus Player).

<h2><span>Funding Purpose</span></h2>
<p><strong>Coding - </strong></p>
<p>Avalanche needs a lot of ""realistic"" aspects to make the game really hit home, hence we need experienced coders who have been in the industry for years making professional games who basically really know what they are doing. These professional coders live off their wages from game developers such as myself and hence they require a pretty hefty wage.</p>
<p><strong>Art -</strong></p>
<p>Avalanche could do with some pretty great artwork for publicity reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Game Modelers - </strong></p>
<p>Without money our previous game modelers have been left in the balance, trying to do good by Xenarch Gaming  continuing to tribute to Avalanche but without pay their motivation and hope is dimming. Money for excess modeling would be great.</p>
<h2><span>How we thank our supporters!</span></h2>
<p><span>Not only will you receive the perks listed for the amount you've donated, If you've donated a minimum of $15 you will receive your name etched into a massive tree in the center of the map.</span></p>
<p><span>This tree is a list of ""Past Survivors"" in the game, you'll be one of them!</span></p>

Josh M wishes to learn all that he can on business and the development end of Game Creation; so that he can take of his career in game development. Josh runs his own Game development company called Prion Games.Josh is currently working on the UI of Avalanche making multiple prototypes and working on Icons and such.
 
Josh Savage.
With a previous background of three years using Unity Editor and two Years experience in computer science it is clear to us that Josh has his feet placed firmly in the Indie Game Developement Scene. Josh S manages the level design.
 
Funding Purpose
Coding - 
Avalanche needs a lot of ""realistic"" aspects to make the game really hit home, hence we need experienced coders who have been in the industry for years making professional games who basically really know what they are doing. These professional coders live off their wages from game developers such as myself and hence they require a pretty hefty wage.
Art -
Avalanche could do with some pretty great artwork for publicity reasons.
Game Modelers - 
Without money our previous game modelers have been left in the balance, trying to do good by Xenarch Gaming  continuing to tribute to Avalanche but without pay their motivation and hope is dimming. Money for excess modeling would be great.

About the goal...
 We're perfectly aware that the campaign isn't going to get anywhere close to our original, over-optimistic goal of 25k. This is primarily because we vastly overestimated our own self-marketing abilities: our pageview stats are... underwhelming, to say the least.
But this doesn't mean the end of Species. Far from it: we will build this game, at cost if we have to, and since we're using flexible funding the money our contributors have provided will get to us regardless. It will be put towards maintaining the website and paying our artist.
But I just want to make something very very clear:
Species will still get made.
One way or another, we're going to make this game a reality.
Any last-minute contributions would still of course still be a huge help in making sure we stay out of the black for as long as possible, so please don't let the original goal keep you from contributing. 
----------------
 

What is Species: Artificial Life, Real Evolution?


Species is a game about macroscopic-scale evolution using a scientifically accurate simulation that you can explore and interact with, and even perform some science of your own.

 
A randomly generated world in the game. Each map generates a series of biomes and height & fertility maps, which is populated by creatures in the evolution simulation
 
To be more precise, Species is a scientifically-accurate natural-selection simulator which allows you to experience evolution first-hand, simulated from the very first principles of evolutionary science:


Variation (every creature is uniquely defined by it’s genes),


Mutation (child creatures are randomly modified versions of their parents), and 


Natural Selection (the environment affects every creature in their struggle to survive).

With these principles as it’s gameplay mechanics, Species recreates the same unguided pressures that drove the development of all life on earth over the last 4 billion years.
Whether you just want to observe, watching and studying as the tree of life constructs itself from a single species, or you want to be an active influence on the development of the species in the game, is up to you.
 


      

A group of creatures in the game, each randomly generated.Yes, the green one terrifies us too.

There are many good academic evolution simulators across the Internet, evolving colours, numbers, text or even single celled organisms.  There are also many games, claiming to be based on the science of evolution, but which actually implement none of the mechanics behind evolution.
 Species is something new: both a game, accessible and entertaining, allowing you to explore a large 3D world filled with hundreds of unique, procedurally-generated creatures... and a evolutionary simulator,  implemented from the ground up with the intention of making a realistic and genuine model of evolution.
 

       Species simulates the life cycle through birth, adulthood, death, and whatever that pink thing is. 
With herbivores and carnivores, combat, mating, behavioral and physiological evolution, population dynamics like extinctions and explosions, speciation, and many more features to come, the world of Species is a complex, rich, and adaptive environment, featuring:
 
A detailed, macroscopic 3D world: the first of it's kind in a natural selection simulator, filled with hundreds of unique procedurally-generated creatures all competing for survival.
Genuine natural selection: No fitness function, no predefined goals: just survival. The player can aid and interact with the simulation, but they will never control it.
A scientific approach: Evolution, speciation, extinction: these are not a direct functions of the game, they're natural effects of the game's mechanics.
Procedural gameplay: whether you start from a group of slug-worms or generate a population of random creatures, the game carves out it’s own history full of population explosions, speciations and the extinctions of the uncompetitive or just plain unlucky.
Real-time evolution: Select a species, accelerate time, and watch as it’s shape and stats morph in front of your eyes.

      That's one suspicious-looking cactus.
When we first learned that this hadn’t been done before, our reaction was surprise. Out of all the time and energy invested in video games and scientific simulations both, how was it possible that a proper evolution game didn’t already exist?  After all, we wanted to play it, so surely others did too?
But we came to realise: this was something that genuinely hadn’t been done before. A variety of vaguely similar things had been done, but nothing quite like this. So we set out to do it. 
Sometimes, that’s all the reason you need.
 
So, why Indiegogo?
     
Because this thing has the potential to be really, REALLY freaking awesome.
 
Species has been in the works, in some form or another, for the past 8 years or so. In that time, it's developed a long way, and recently has begun growing in leaps and bounds. A year ago, the first public dev videos were released, and the feedback and support we recieved from everyone was very encouraging, and we're ready to take the next step forward in development.
We've been working hard to bring the game up to a high standard both in the simulation and design aspects alike, but now it has reached the point where our work on Species has hit the harsh reality of the real world, and the commitments real life brings with it.
We chose to go with Indiegogo becuase it is a more accessible funding platform to those outside the US, as we in the Species development team are, in the hope that we would be able to raise enough funding to support ourselves during the game's development. 
To that end, funding from Indiegogo will be used for:
Keeping the developers alive: Enough funding to keep our development team fed, sheltered, and clothed for a year while they work full-time on Species.
Web hosting: Funding to keep the site, forums, and download services online, as well as the ability to provide online multiplayer in later releases.
Speaking of Online Multiplayer: Keeping our goals reasonable, there won't be any kind of attempt at making Species into an MMO. But something that can plausibly be added is the ability to physically connect players' maps together, combining their CPU power and creating a potentially limitless online overworld. This is possibly the single most ambitious and difficult-to-implement feature on the list, but if we can do it, it would mean the difference between a self-contained petrie-dish world, and a planet.
 
Sound and Music: Species is going to need a lot of help with audio, which is currently being provided by Brain Sugar. Funding from Indiegogo will keep him on the team, in order to provide a full soundtrack for the game throughout its development.
 
Concept, Art, and Design: In order to become a fully fleshed out world, Species not only needs audio, but striking visuals as well, currently being provided by our graphic designer, Jade Taggart. On top of both environment and creature work, Jade is also developing the UI and (planned) vehicle and structure concepts for Species; funding from Indiegogo will help keep her on the team to continue her work.
 
And most importantly, Expanding the game: We're dedicated to seeing Species achieve as much of it's potential as it possibly can, and Indiegogo funding can go a long way towards achieving that goal. 
With your help, here are a selection of the features we hope to implement in the future:


A fully realised ecosystem, where every system impacts and influences every other system, resulting in emergent and unpredictable natural selection pressures.Among the features already planned are flight, water bodies for aquatic and amphibious animals, variable temperature and humidity, growing and migrating forests (made out of reproducing trees with hereditary characteristics, no less), basic forms of symbiosis and parasitic behavior, and others.

Biomes!



Every conceivable biological niche open for the creatures in the game to fill.We want to give them the freedom to evolve into anything, from realistic to fanciful, blind cave-dwelling dinosaurs to giant carnivorous insects, hydrogen-filled organic blimps to schools of sea-dwelling plankton-filtering birds. 

 


Engaging, science-inspired Gameplay: Although the game will always remain a relatively open sandbox and won't have any predefined win-conditions, you'll be able to apply artificial selection pressures.
By running them over with a robotic chainsaw rover.
On top of that horrifyingly awesome thought, you can change the creatures with direct genetic manipulation, change the climate and ecosystem for the better or worse, dynamically build the in-game Tree Of Life by collecting samples and finding fossils, trigger disasters, and do awesome SCIENCE™. 


Complete Modability: A healthy community is key to a successful independant game. By opening as many segments of the game as possible to modding, we can help grow the community. And by using and making online mods, you the community will be able to help unlock far more of Species potential than we developers could do on our own!

 


Mac/Linux Implementation: Species is built with Microsoft XNA Game Studio software, which means it’s not natively supported outside of Windows... but we intend to put some research into the matter, to learn what we can. Although we can't promise anything on this particular front, we do hope to make the game as platform-independant as we possibly can.

I’ve been very passionate about video games, and in love with fighting games for a very long time, and as far as Skullgirls goes I’ve been very active in it’s community since before the game came out. I am best known for my guide on Cerebella, the character I use. I’m considered the best Solo Cerebella, and one of the better, or best Cerebella’s overall.</p>
<p>And I’m making this video for a drive I’m doing. There’s this tournament named EVO , Evolution Championship Series, on July 12<sup>th</sup>. It’s the biggest fighting game tournament in the world, and luckily, with a lot of effort and motivation from the Skullgirls community, we were able to become a main game. And that’s amazing, but, unfortunately, our tournament scene hasn’t been very good, so I feel obligated to do everything I can to support the game and community that I love. But unfortunately, I don’t have the funds to make it there. I was working on it, and I was on track to get there, but there’s been a setback, and it’s not gonna happen. Not without a Miracle, one I’m hoping you guys help me with.</p>
<p>I’m gonna keep trying to get there, and I hope that you guys help me. The information for the drive is down below. There’s a video, I was at East Coast Throwdown 5, in New Jersey, last month, there’s a video of something I did, it’s in the gallery so you know I’m not just some random bum. And I’m also going to be giving away all the money that I win, there’s details on how to do that down below. I’m also going to be making bead art, like this, for all the Skullgirls characters. I don’t have all the colors, so I can’t make them at the moment, but I will be sending those to everyone who donated, and got the proper perk, everyone who donated and I will be sending those to you even if I do not make it, because you donating means you cared enough to want to send me, and I think that deserves a bead necklace.</p>

<strong>What EVO Is</strong><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> &amp;</strong><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </strong><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What I Need</strong>
</h3>
<p>Evo, like I said, is the largest Fighting game tournament in the world, with players flying in from all around the world to attend. They've held one every year for over a decade, and last year there were nearly 10,000 people in attendence (either playing or watching). You can check them out <a href=""http://evo.shoryuken.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. It's held in Las Vegas, Nevada, in July.</p>
<p>Some of you may be very aware of how much a trip to EVO costs, but from my estimations, this is the price breakdown:</p>
<p><strong>Plane Ticket</strong> - $450-500 (depending on if I can get a really cheap ticket)</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Room</strong> - $75-$100 (thankfully the FGC likes room sharring, so the price is less than it normally would be for a three day hotel room)</p>
<p><strong>EVO Tournament price</strong> - $80</p>
<p><strong>Total min estimate (including tax) </strong>- $650-$730</p>
<p>I’ll be working towards this goal as well, but I need your help to make it happen. I need it all by june 30th, but it can take a over a week to recieve funds, so the deadline needs to be earlier.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Perks</strong></h3>
<p>Alright. The actual things you get for donating are over there, to the right. For those of you who don't know what an 8-bit Skullgirls necklace is, they are Megaman-styled sprites, started a while ago in the FGC. I can make any other characters (probably) that aren't on that list, but I need to get some help making the 8-bit design first. <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/eYSemeC.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click Here</a> to see the first Megaman Sprites I'll be using, and <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/1Y2KU/embed#0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click Here</a> to see the second set.</p>
<p>Also, be aware, for any one interested in the tutoring, I live in the US, on the East Coast. There are certain places in the world I cannot play online. You can trade any tutoring for any perk of a lower tier than that one.</p>
<p>Also, if I win any money at EVO (either in a tournament or in a money match), I’mgiving it all away to the people who assisted me in getting there. YOU. I’ll set it up that very night and give away everything I won. In order to enter the give-away, simply tweet #SendZidianeToEvo or tweet about this or with a link before June 18th. If you tweet it before EVO (or during EVO) and I have enough to go, I'll look into other prizes I can get you, but I need it before then to get more support.</p>
<p>If I place top 8 at the tournament, I’ll win money. The money is split like this: 60/18/8/4/3/3/2/2 (those are percentages of the total pot). There is a $2000 pot bonus right now, so with that alone, 1<sup>st</sup> place gets 1200, and 2<sup>nd</sup> gets about 400, and so on (8<sup>th</sup> gets 40). That’s before anyone even enters, though, so if, say, 300 people show up (the goal we are aiming for), at 10$ a person, the pot will be $5000, with 1<sup>st</sup> getting $2000 and scaling down for top 8 places (in that scenario, 8th is 100).</p>
<p>If I have any extra money, I'll be Money Matching people. I'll give away any money I win in those as well, and I will not be using any winnings in money matches (no chance of me winning some money, then losing what I won later).</p>
<p>I'm also goint to be trying to get other prizes to give out. I will try to see if Lab Zero brings any special Skullgirls stuff. If they have anything, I'll try to get my hands on it and get that stuff to you guys as well.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>If I don't get make the trip?</strong></h3>
<p>Now, that all sounds nice, but what if I don’t make enough to go to EVO? If I don’t get enough money by the time it turns June 17th (I need it early cause IGG says they can take up to 10 days to fund me, and the deadline is June 30th for EVO registration), everyone gets their money back. Simple as that.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>The Impact You Will Have On Me and Skullgirls</strong></h3>
<p>I can't even explain to you the kind of impact this would have for me. Having never been to EVO before, this would be something for me to remember for the rest of my life. You would make me so happy I would... I don't know what I'd do, but it would be amazing (going to EVO would be amazing, not what I do).</p>
<p>My personal feelings aside, EVO is a very important thing for Skullgirls. You may not know, but the Tournament scene for Skullgirls is nearly dead, and has been since it's release. The tournament aspect is considered to be the number one important thing to the survival of a title (in this case, Skullgirls) in the FGC. Skullgirls actually was on the brink a few months ago, nearly dead, and the devs nearly moved on to other projects. Thankfully, the past few months have seen a surge of activity (through campaigns you might have seen, the Brest Cancer Drive and the Squigly Campaign which raised a combine total of $900k+). That was amazing beyond explanation, but the tournament scene hasn't reacted very much. We are still struggling.</p>
<p>On July 12th, however, is EVO, the world's largest fighting game tournament, and our biggest chance to make a comeback. Skullgirls is going to be an (unofficial) official game on the main stage as thanks for our contributions to the cure for breast cancer, and we need every person we can get to show up to help preserve this second wind. I would very much like to assist Skullgirls in this area by showing up to EVO, but I don’t have the funds right now, and it’s fairly uncertain if I will. Me getting to EVO will help make sure that this community can continue to thrive, and I hope you’ll help me in this.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></h3>
<p><strong>500: </strong>If I make this much, and have enough money in my own pocket to still make the trip, I will still do the give away. If I don't get enough donors and have enough money on my own to make the trip, I'll donate the money to myself (to ensure that I reach the goal and can thus access the money in the drive, since this is fixed funding) and still give back to you guys.</p>
<p><strong>1400:</strong> There's no way I'll get this much, but if I do, I'll use it to go to EVO next year and hold the exact same giveaway with the exact same rules. In this scenario, you could potentially see someone win Two EVO's in a row and give all of the money from both winnings away for the first time ever.</p>
<p>All money made up until this goal, yet after the 700 mark will be used in money matches, or trying to buy cool Skullgirls stuff at EVO.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>If you aren’t financially capable of supporting this but want to, I know exactly how you feel. If you can’t spare a few bucks, maybe you could spread the word? If you got a Twitter, Deviantart, Tumblr, Youtube channel, any help is welcome.</p></div>","Who is Zidiane?

Stretch Goals
500: If I make this much, and have enough money in my own pocket to still make the trip, I will still do the give away. If I don't get enough donors and have enough money on my own to make the trip, I'll donate the money to myself (to ensure that I reach the goal and can thus access the money in the drive, since this is fixed funding) and still give back to you guys.
1400: There's no way I'll get this much, but if I do, I'll use it to go to EVO next year and hold the exact same giveaway with the exact same rules. In this scenario, you could potentially see someone win Two EVO's in a row and give all of the money from both winnings away for the first time ever.
