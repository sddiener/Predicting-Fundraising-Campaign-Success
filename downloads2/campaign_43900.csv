The case design, as well as the finishing, is widely approved by our customers. However, we would like to go further. We increased the budget of the case by 220% in order to achieve a swiss-made standard. In order to make it more sharper and smoother, the watch case is manufactured independently into 3 parts- the two lugs; and the body itself, so as to polish them independently. It then gives out a new level of polishing and exquisite than the normal case. Such costly production method could only be found in luxury watches production.</p><p>The case is made of 316L stainless steel which is widely used in high-end watches. Multi-polishing methods are applied: including mirror polished on the bezel and the edges of the lugs, horizontal brushed on the sides, vertical brushed on the lugs and circular brush on the back. And for this time, we redesigned the dome-shaped sapphire crystal in order to have its smooth and clear curve.</p><p>Although these production methods are long and costly, and sometimes it is unnoticeable until you have a closer look, we aim to give you the best, attractive, durable, and elegant watch cases.</p><p>*Every watch is individually numbered.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580152376/rf5rvjlkni72qarzts4t.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603437071/xvwjdblkfbcir1yleaao.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603262865/ksy9bd7n9rfcsn0i9uq9.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580152438/bjbtwkj2gdkvgkpu9ezf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>SLIM WATCH - 8.5MM MULTIFUNCTIONAL MECHANICAL WATCH</strong></p><p>Slim appearance is the iconic design element of Behrens Original.

This is one of those watches we always enjoy seeing on collector’s wrist. With our own developed time-telling mechanism together with its beauty and precision, THE SPACESHIP is appealing to every watch lover.HOW TO TELL THE TIME?The main feature of THE SPACESHIP is the unique in-house time-telling mechanism, which tells the time in an entirely different way from most mechanical timepieces, that make use of the typical hour and minute hands.The rotation and revolution of the two specially made sapphire crystal thin plates show the time. The minute plate rotates once per hour while the hour plate rotates 30 degrees in the section of 55-60 minutes every hour. Time is specially shown with the red pointer underneath. Each of our 22 unique parts, as well as every gear of our mechanism, is meticulously arranged and tested to avoid shock and ageing.This complicated time-telling system requires accurate and precise calculation as well as enough testing. Thus, it is not easily found in normal watch brands and factories. The 22 unique parts combined with 15 months of development, uncountable modification and testing models, our mechanism is reliable and sturdy.*Swiss Super-LumiNova® BGW9 is used for numerals which emits a Blue-Green glow in the dark and looks white in the daylight condition.*More about Swiss Super-LumiNova® BGW9https://luciusatelier.com/blogs/news/learn-abou...A GROUP OF WATCH ENTHUSIASTSBEHRENS ORIGINAL is a group of watch enthusiasts gather and create a brand that is based in Hong Kong.

Thus, we are dedicated to creating this masterpiece - THE SPACESHIP. UNIQUE TIME-TELLING MECHANISM (WE ARE NOT OUTSOURCING)It is very complicated to develop a new system as a precisely developed system is a combination of accuracy, materials, gears, reliability, and appearance. All of the parts have to be perfect in order to create a great mechanism. That is why many so-called ""unique watches"" appeared to be very similar because they share the same mechanism sourced from one or two major manufacturers.However, it is not the case for us. We have our own R&D centre which we are determined to create our own system and mechanism. With 15 months of development, uncountable modifying and testing models; our mechanism is reliable and sturdy, with an appealing and high-end appearance.We know that real watch lovers may concern: RELIABILITY AND ON-WRIST TESTINGThis time-telling mechanism is completely developed by ourselves. We can guarantee the best quality of the mechanism. We create it, we test it, and we know it. 
22 Unique parts. ZERO ready-made parts 
15 months of development 
9 months of on-wrist testing 
More than 50 modifications 
More than 20 testing models 
We have encountered many difficulties for this unique mechanism. We fixed them one by one during the 15 months of development MATERIAL AND APPEARANCE
We are not using aluminium like others do, as it is a soft metal, it will deform after some days; it is hardly be polished. We then developed our very special alloy as our mechanism main support. With the lightweightness and hardness, our mechanism is sturdy and nicely polished, which also results in providing a high-end appearance. 
Platinum coating is applied to create great protection, as well as a shiny, well-polished appearance. 
Sapphire crystal is used for the hour/minute plate. With its incredible transparency, the gear underneath can be seen clearly.
TURNING FORCE
Unique designed bearing is used. The whole weight of the mechanism is hung onto the bearing system developed by us, and thus, very little turning force is needed to turn the whole mechanism. 
The turning force is very little and the accuracy of the watch will not be affected. It is as normal as pushing normal watch hands. 
Gravitation will not affect the accuracy of the movement as our whole system is hung onto the bearing system, mounted directly onto the dial. 
MULTI-POLISHING CASE 220% more costThe excellent case design is one of the significant symbols of our watches. It is also widely loved by 400+ BEHRENS ORIGINAL customers. This time, we decided to invest more to bring out an even higher standard watch case.The previous watch cases of THE MOONPHASE and THE ALL-ROUND are already well-made. The case design, as well as the finishing, is widely approved by our customers. However, we would like to go further. We increased the budget of the case by 220% in order to achieve a swiss-made standard. In order to make it more sharper and smoother, the watch case is manufactured independently into 3 parts- the two lugs; and the body itself, so as to polish them independently. It then gives out a new level of polishing and exquisite than the normal case. Such costly production method could only be found in luxury watches production.The case is made of 316L stainless steel which is widely used in high-end watches. Multi-polishing methods are applied: including mirror polished on the bezel and the edges of the lugs, horizontal brushed on the sides, vertical brushed on the lugs and circular brush on the back. And for this time, we redesigned the dome-shaped sapphire crystal in order to have its smooth and clear curve.Although these production methods are long and costly, and sometimes it is unnoticeable until you have a closer look, we aim to give you the best, attractive, durable, and elegant watch cases.*Every watch is individually numbered.SLIM WATCH - 8.5MM MULTIFUNCTIONAL MECHANICAL WATCHSlim appearance is the iconic design element of Behrens Original. Our slim design is adored by 400+ Behrens Original backers and supporters.In order to have a nice mechanical watch with a thin design, we provide the best we can: With the well-designed cutting of the case and the super-high quality redesigned dome-shaped sapphire, our watch provides an incredible slim appearance. The thickness of the watch is only 8.5mm, exclusively the dome shape sapphire. With the dome-shaped sapphire, the total height is only 12.15mm.Every part of our design is uniquely made for reaching our goal: a thin mechanical watch. We have gone under many tests on making a thin, durable watch. Our design team remade the dial part more than five times to remove 10-30C each time. There are no words can fully describe the hardship we had in the process, but we have put our efforts wholeheartedly in making this unique yet slim mechanical watch.SAPPHIRE CRYSTAL ONLY - 3.65MM THICKFor producing luxurious watches, we persist to use only sapphire crystal for both sides of the watches. Due to the remarkable hardness of sapphires - 9 on the Mohs scale, our watches can hardly be damaged by plain scratches. Thus, we believe that sapphire crystal is the most suitable material for daily wear.Dome-shaped sapphire crystal is used to give an ultimately slim appearance to the watch. As sapphire is a hard material (A 5mm thick raw sapphire material is used to craft into a 3.65mm dome-shaped crystal), it is beyond difficult to make the dome-shaped sapphire. Since it is costly and time-consuming (our machine can only produce 3 pieces of dome-shaped sapphire crystal max. per day), the yield rate is low.ACCURACY - 7 DAYS, T0, T24 TESTSWatch modification and movement tuning are our central focus. As such, absolute accuracy is always on our important checklist. We ensure the quality of every part by using strict control testing standards before assembling the watches.The testing procedure lasts 7 daysDay 1 Before assembling the watches, the movement is fully wound (also known as T0) mechanically. The movement is tested in five positions, crown left, crown up, crown down, dial-up and dial down. Then given a rest period of 24 hours(also known as T24) , the movement is tested again in the five positions.Day 3 After assembling all the parts together, the watch is put into an auto-winding machine for 1 day. The watch would be fully wound and be tested with the same testing procedure in Day 1.Day 5 The watch keeps putting into an auto-winding machine. The watch would be fully wound and be tested with the same testing procedure on Day 1.Day 7 Before packing, the watch is fully wound(T0) and is tested in five positions again.All our watches have to pass all of the above procedures before delivery. We make sure that the accuracy of our watches is highly maintained in -20~+20 seconds/day. We tested the watches in more positions than the normal quality checkups do - we tested the watches in 5 positions while the others tested in 3 positions only.We need to ensure the watches are adequate in every situation. We then on-wrist tested the sample watches for more than 9 months before we started our Kickstarter campaign. The stableness of BEHRENS ORIGINAL watches is highly guaranteed.OUR MOVEMENT - MIYOTA 9015Movement is the soul of all watches and that is exactly what attracts all watch collectors. Our factory has more than 10 years of experience in the Swiss and Japan movement watchmaking and watch modification.This time we selected the Miyota 9015 for our movement, which is well-known for its slimness, reliability and stability. This Japan movement functions with a frequency of 4Hz (28,800 A/h), 24 jewels, 42-hour power reserve, automatic winding, and a sweep second movement. With a movement of height 3.9mm and 26mm overall diameter, it is super slim. Combining both thin body and functionality, this movement is only used in high-class watches. Although the price of this movement is very high, we persist to provide the best we can.ITALIAN CALF LEATHER STRAP -  INTERCHANGEABLE CATCHWe are all perfectionists, we see the pairing of the best leather strap and BEHRENS watches is an obligation. We provide a high quality fine crafted Italian calf leather strap as usual to give you the most comfortable and pleasant wearing experience.

<p>Nothing beats stargazing under a clear black sky. We've taken inspiration from stargazing and developed this color. It's not quite pitch black, but it's dark enough so that if you squint your eyes, you might just see the specks of stars. </p>

<p>Foreword: Many so-called ""sustainable brands"" are in it purely for the profit. We're different. We're here to send a message to the H&amp;Ms and Zaras of the world. Hopefully, you'll stick with us as we tell you why the issues we're addressing are so important. </p> <p><strong>Ethical Production</strong></p>
<p>We're partnered with a factory in China renowned for their garment quality. But why China? Doesn't that mean it's cheap quality? Actually, a lot of Chinese factories have been in the garment game for quite a while, meaning that they employ skilled workers who do outstanding work. We also made sure that we're working with a factory that treats their workers right. Our workers receive well above minimum wage and have working hours capped to prevent overworking.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Our ""No Plastic"" Commitment </strong></p>
<p>In 2019, our company made a commitment to eliminate all plastics from our supply chain, which includes our products, packaging, and promotional material. So far, we’ve found tremendous success in revising our production processes and developing plastic-free solutions. The majority of synthetics and plastics are used in two areas: fabrics and materials used for garments and polyester wrapping used to package our garments leaving our factories. Since our initial sampling phase, we’ve eliminated plastic completely, packaging and shipping our garments in recycled papers and cardboards. We’ve also eliminated all synthetics from our garments. Instead of using plastic-based prints, we use water-based ink for detailing. And everything from our wash tags to our fabric composition is plastic-free.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Building Stuff that Lasts</strong></p>
<p>Fast fashion is amongst the world’s most wasteful and pollutive industries. With hundreds of millions of individual garments being produced and sold per year, it’s no surprise that companies like H&amp;M and Zara continue to gain popularity. But the comforts of fast fashion come at a large environmental cost. The cheap nature of fast fashion garments results in a high turnover rate, contributing to the growing problem of textile waste. The methods used to mass manufacture cheap garments quickly are also extremely harmful to the environment. Worst of all, the throwaway culture that fast fashion promotes harms us as consumers, encouraging us to consume more and more without regard for our ecological footprint. To break the cycle of fast fashion, we’re building sustainable products that last.</p> <p><strong>Reducing Microplastic Pollution </strong></p>
<p>Microplastic pollution is a relatively novel form of pollution that presents a serious threat to ocean ecosystems. As an industry, fashion is responsible for contributing to this method of pollution through its extensive use of synthetic textiles, which shed microplastic upon wash. These microplastics flow straight into the ocean, bypassing our water filtration systems. Scientists have estimated that there are anywhere from 15 to 51 trillion individual pieces of microfibers in our oceans. Collectively, they make up 85% of the human-made plastic debris in the ocean, and 35% of that is from clothing.</p>
<p>As part of our ""No Plastic"" commitment, we've eliminated all possible sources of microplastic shedding from our clothing. Each part of this hoodie, from the clothes tags to the fabric itself, has been constructed without any synthetic material, leaving no room for microplastic shedding.</p> <p><strong>Bamboo</strong></p>
<p>Our bamboo production uses a closed-loop process, meaning that all the water and solvents used are re-used, significantly minimizing the environmental effects of production. These bamboo fibers are then shipped to our yarn mill, where they're combined with our sustainably-grown cotton. The finished fabric is sent off to be dyed, where we apply our signature Yosemite Green, Midnight Black. At this point, the fabric is inspected for any flaws, and once it passes inspection, we send it off to our garment factory, where it is cut and sewn into your hoodie.</p> <p><strong>Our Lifetime Guarantee</strong></p>
<p>We stand behind the products we build. That's why we're offering a lifetime guarantee on this hoodie! We'll gladly replace your garment should any defects or constructional issues arise within the lifespan of your garment. Please note that this only applies to traditional use cases; we will not cover intentional damages or irresponsible usage of our product. </p>
<p>Please note: our lifetime guarantee protects the owner against manufacturing defects in materials and workmanship for the lifetime of the product. If your product covered by this warranty fails due to a manufacturing defect we will repair it without charge, or replace it, at our discretion.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Meet The Forever Hoodie! It's built to last, meaning this will be the first and last hoodie you buy of this caliber. It's also got all the functionality of a travel hoodie, but this one's guaranteed to hold up no matter how many adventures you go on. Check out all its features below!

We designed our new line of hoodies to be tough. At leif, we care about the environment. That's why all our products are built to have as little of an environmental impact as possible. This hoodie's no different, but we've added a bunch of new innovative features.
 
Features

Our Secured Kangaroo Pocket is a safe place to put your things. It's big enough to accommodate anything up to a small tablet, and you'll never have to worry about anything falling out.
 

Ever get stuck on a long road trip with nowhere to rest your head? With The Forever Hoodie, this is a problem of the past! Conveniently roll your hoodie up into its hood and enjoy a nice, long nap.
 

We've designed the seams on this hoodie to be as durable as possible while also being insanely comfy. Run, jump, and stretch without worrying about tearing a seam! 
 

All the stitching done on our hoodie is done by experts to ensure that everything lasts as long as possible. We paid special attention to stitch density to avoid those pesky stray threads. 
 

We meant it when we said that we built this hoodie to last. Our Ironlock Ribbing ensures that this hoodie will keep its shape. It'll look as good as new, whether it's 5 months or 5 years down the road.
 

We've developed this bamboo blend specifically for the Forever Hoodie. It's a high-density bamboo-cotton blend in French terry. We love this fabric because it's shrink resistant, highly durable, and probably one of the most comfortable things we've felt.

<p>EMMESPHERE is a functional jewelry brand conceived by three ladies; a jewelry designer, a product and user experience specialist and a digital guru. We aim to be the breath of fresh air in the functional wearables category, offering products that breaks the convention of typical consumer electronics design aesthetics, which is characteristic of what we see in the market today. </p>
<p>Having all worked in the Consumer Electronics sector, the founding team members strongly identify with the latent needs of consumers who look for products which looks good on them while giving them the good performance and a pleasant user experience.</p>
<p>At  EMMESPHERE, we believe that aesthetics should not be compromised as a result of pure conformity to the current norms in designs for consumer electronics. We strive for “form meets function and fashion”.</p>

Timeline    

 
Concept to Production
Our founding members and our engineering team are highly aligned and committed to bring something different and attractive to the market, and has worked endlessly to improve on the performance of the product while maintaining the essence of the design. While concept and development is an integral part of the process, we do not underestimate the importance of manufacturing capability to successfully bring a product to market. As such, our our team has identified at an early stage, the manufacturing partners of both our electronics parts and our jewelry parts, and have since worked hand-in-hand with them to ensure the development is on track and in line with manufacturability at the utmost quality.

 
Production Stage


 
 
The Team

EMMESPHERE is a functional jewelry brand conceived by three ladies; a jewelry designer, a product and user experience specialist and a digital guru. We aim to be the breath of fresh air in the functional wearables category, offering products that breaks the convention of typical consumer electronics design aesthetics, which is characteristic of what we see in the market today. 
Having all worked in the Consumer Electronics sector, the founding team members strongly identify with the latent needs of consumers who look for products which looks good on them while giving them the good performance and a pleasant user experience.
At  EMMESPHERE, we believe that aesthetics should not be compromised as a result of pure conformity to the current norms in designs for consumer electronics. We strive for “form meets function and fashion”.

<h3><strong>Greetings from Barcelona!</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Ricardo Bernal,<strong> I am the creator of AMA Project </strong>and Tiger Soul Sunglasses, I was born in Mexico and immigrated to Spain 6 years ago. As an immigrant I've faced a lot of obstacles and complicated situations, situations which have encouraged me to work really hard. When I arrived to this country I launched a small collection of sunglasses, I put them in a suitcase and I went out to the streets of Barcelona in an attempt to sell directly to small stores and boutiques. Eventually I managed to sell my products in street markets, fairs and large music festivals. Three years later I opened my own shop, and <strong>at the moment I have 2 boutiques in Barcelona and more than 50 distributors around the world.</strong><br/><br/><i>Mi nombre es Ricardo Bernal, <strong>soy el creador de AMA Project </strong>y de Tiger Soul Sunglasses<strong>,</strong> una marca de gafas de sol, nací en México y emigre a España hace 6 años y como cualquier inmigrante me enfrente a miles de situaciones difíciles, lo cual me impulsó a trabajar mucho. Al llegar a este país lancé una pequeña colección de gafas de sol que puse en una maleta y salí por las calles de Barcelona a vender, de tienda en tienda, y con el tiempo comencé a vender en mercadillos, ferias y grandes festivales musicales. Tres años después abrí mi propia boutique, y en este momento tengo <strong>2 boutiques en Barcelona y mas de 50 puntos de venta alrededor del mundo</strong>.</i><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583324598/rdch00q52ktacfydqzxl.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>In recent years I've spent around 12 hours working everyday and at one point I began to notice that my eyes, after being over 2 hours in front of the computer, got tired, felt dry and sometimes hurt slightly. I talked to my uncle, who is an eye doctor, and explained my situation. He told me that this was happening due to the <strong>blue light emitted by screens of different electronic devices. </strong>I decided to do some research and I also found out that blue light alters sleep cycles at night, which worsens people's quality of life. So following my uncles advice, and through personal research I began to develop AMA Project.<br/><br/><i>Estos últimos años he pasado 12 horas trabajando al día y en un punto comencé a notar que mis ojos, al estar mas de 2 horas frente al ordenador, se cansaban, se sentían secos y a veces dolían ligeramente. Consulté a mi tío oftalmológo, le explique mi situación, y me dijo que esto sucedía debido a la <strong>luz azul emitida por las pantallas de diferentes dispositivos electrónicos</strong>. Después decidí hacer un poco de investigación y encontré que la luz azul altera también altera  los ciclos de sueño por la noche, lo cual empeora la calidad de vida de las personas. Entonces siguiendo los consejos de mi tío, y a través de investigación propia comencé a desarrollar AMA Project. </i><br/> </p>

When I arrived to this country I launched a small collection of sunglasses, I put them in a suitcase and I went out to the streets of Barcelona in an attempt to sell directly to small stores and boutiques. Eventually I managed to sell my products in street markets, fairs and large music festivals. Three years later I opened my own shop, and at the moment I have 2 boutiques in Barcelona and more than 50 distributors around the world.Mi nombre es Ricardo Bernal, soy el creador de AMA Project y de Tiger Soul Sunglasses, una marca de gafas de sol, nací en México y emigre a España hace 6 años y como cualquier inmigrante me enfrente a miles de situaciones difíciles, lo cual me impulsó a trabajar mucho. Al llegar a este país lancé una pequeña colección de gafas de sol que puse en una maleta y salí por las calles de Barcelona a vender, de tienda en tienda, y con el tiempo comencé a vender en mercadillos, ferias y grandes festivales musicales. Tres años después abrí mi propia boutique, y en este momento tengo 2 boutiques en Barcelona y mas de 50 puntos de venta alrededor del mundo.In recent years I've spent around 12 hours working everyday and at one point I began to notice that my eyes, after being over 2 hours in front of the computer, got tired, felt dry and sometimes hurt slightly. I talked to my uncle, who is an eye doctor, and explained my situation. He told me that this was happening due to the blue light emitted by screens of different electronic devices. I decided to do some research and I also found out that blue light alters sleep cycles at night, which worsens people's quality of life. So following my uncles advice, and through personal research I began to develop AMA Project.Estos últimos años he pasado 12 horas trabajando al día y en un punto comencé a notar que mis ojos, al estar mas de 2 horas frente al ordenador, se cansaban, se sentían secos y a veces dolían ligeramente. Consulté a mi tío oftalmológo, le explique mi situación, y me dijo que esto sucedía debido a la luz azul emitida por las pantallas de diferentes dispositivos electrónicos. Después decidí hacer un poco de investigación y encontré que la luz azul altera también altera  los ciclos de sueño por la noche, lo cual empeora la calidad de vida de las personas. Entonces siguiendo los consejos de mi tío, y a través de investigación propia comencé a desarrollar AMA Project.  
 
The mission of AMA Project is to produce high quality anti blue light glasses, forget about fatigue, headaches, dry eyes and improve your health. We offer four different models of glasses: three of them are made of fully flexible Italian acetate, lightweight and stylish.  the fourth model is made of rigid metal. These glasses will protect the eyesight and improve the quality of sleep of any person who spends several hours in front of any blue light source (computers, mobile phones, tablets). La misión de AMA Project es producir gafas anti luz azul de alta calidad, Olvídate de la fatiga, dolores de cabeza y ojos secos, mejora tu salud. Ofrecemos cuatro modelos diferentes de gafas: tres de ellos son de acetato Italiano totalmente flexibles, y el cuarto modelo esta hecho de metal rígido. Estas gafas se encargaran de proteger la vista y mejorar la calidad de sueño de cualquier persona que pase varias horas frente a cualquier pantalla de luz azul (ordenadores, móviles, tablets)In addition to solving a problem that many of us face, I want to contribute to a very important cause in a personal way.

<p>I'm immensely grateful for the support of my peeps. Whatever your contribution, knowing that you believed and got behind me means SO much. Ground-up production will begin on a small scale, and every dollar will help to buy materials and make samples to take pre-orders.</p>
<p>DERBY GURL will rise, in true grass roots style. </p>
<p>BIG UPS!</p>
<p>Lux</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting my campaign for DERBY GURL, a roller derby-inspired fashion line. I’m Lux Mayhem, and after many years in the fashion industry, roller derby has become my designing muse. DERBY GURL is for skaters, fans, and modern women—derby-powered fashion, whether or not you strut around a track!</p>
<p>DERBY GURL’s look is based on (1) the empowered femininity of roller derby (2) the aesthetics and culture of derby (3) the athleticism of derby. The high-quality fashion pieces are classic camp-punk-burlesque, with styles for females in their teens or 40's.</p>
<p>And DERBY GURL is more than just great fashions—10% of all net profits will be donated to roller derby leagues, so that young girls and women can gain the benefits of derby. What benefits, you ask? Self-esteem, hardcore athleticism, a sense of community, alter egos, and the possibility of becoming future Olympians! Playing roller derby enhances the lives of girls and women all over the world, including mine.</p>
<p>I believe in DERBY GURL and have invested my time and savings into getting it this far. Now in the grassroots spirit of roller derby, I am turning to <em>you</em> to help produce and launch this fashion line. You can be a DERBY GURL pioneer! In return, you will get rad fashions and the opportunity to be Rollerella’s derby wife, man crush, or even her blockers. And you can be the first to wear limited edition DERBY GURL clothes.</p>
<p>I'm proud to call myself a derby gurl, and am extremely excited to dedicate myself to sharing my derby-inspired fashions with the world. Your $5 or $500 will help shape my passion into roller derby DNA, and in return you will receive sweet perks….oh, and a hug, a whip, or even a Pegassist. ( ;</p>
<p><strong>                                                                 ~</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important Points:</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Why is this fashion line significant? </strong>Because it's greater than fashion or clothing. It's about taking part in the global phenomenon that is roller derby, and the culture and style it inspires. DERBY GURL sends a message to women everywhere that it's okay to celebrate your curves and athleticism and indie spirit.</p>
<p><strong>2. Why does this fashion line need to exist? </strong>Because of the positive social impact of roller derby. And because DERBY GURL celebrates the empowered femininity of roller derby unlike any other fashion line.</p>
<p><strong>3. Why should it happen now? </strong>Because roller derby is the world's fastest growing sport, and it’s time for a derby-inspired fashion line that reflects its culture and aesthetics. The global revival has spawned nearly 50,000 derby gurls, who are synonymous with hardcore, empowered athletes.</p>
<p>4. <strong>What makes DERBY GURL different than other fashions? </strong>There's no dedicated derby-inspired fashion line that embraces skaters, fans, and modern women (with a unisex bag for gents, too). DERBY GURL celebrates roller derby and female athleticism with skateworthy style!</p>

<p>We are Rainy Day
Anime, a store in Colorado Springs, Colorado, devoted to Japanese Animation,
Manga and Japanese pop culture. We’ve been in business for almost 4 years as a
store front and 7 years as a vendor at local cons. At Rainy Day Anime we try to
be more than just a store, we want to be a valued part of the Anime community.
We do this by being knowledgeable and friendly, running cool events, like
viewings and gaming parties, and just creating a positive atmosphere for people
to geek out in. with We get really excited when people show their love for the
store, whether its open enthusiasm upon their arrival, fan art of our mascot,
or rave reviews online like this: (<a href=""http://english121evaluations.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/anime-lovers-united/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://english121evaluations.wordpress.com/2012...</a>).
</p>
<p><b>Why Crowdfunding? </b></p>
<p>A
lot of people have suggested we sell our own T-shirts, bags, and even umbrellas
(We are Rainy Day Anime after all). Our 2 biggest hurdles with this is coming
up with the money and deciding on a design, so it seemed like a good idea to us
to set it up were you can preorder these items and you only get charged, when
we have enough to do it. Hence:  Crowd
funding!</p>
<p>We will be promoting this campaign in store, through
our website, Facebook, and other social media. Spreading the word has been and
will be the key to our success. While this mainly affects our local anime community, we hope
this can be a launching point, to increased national and possibly international
attention.</p>
<p><b>Where is the money
going?</b></p>
<p>First
and foremost this is to make Rainy Day Anime branded merchandise. We will need
a base of $3000 to get it going. This will Fund store themed bumper stickers,
reusable shopping bags, and T-Shirts. We would like to get about twice as many
printed as are backed through this campaign so we can use them for future
promotions and sales.  Additional money
will go towards having more products made (See our stretch goals), ensuring the
quality of these products and improving the store. Improvements we would like
to have includes new displays, a bigger, better inventory more focused on what
you want, a barcode scanner for speedy checkout, and more website support. We
will consult you the backers on what improvement you most want to support.</p>
<p><b>What is the time line?</b></p>
<p>Starting July 1<sup>st</sup>
and ending July 31<sup>st</sup>. This will coincide with an art contest we are
currently running which will also end on July 31<sup>st</sup>. (<a href=""http://rainydayanime.com/events/art-contest/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://rainydayanime.com/events/art-contest/</a>)</p>
<p>We plan to spend
August Finalizing the designs. </p>
<p>We plan to get
everything ordered and printed in Sept.</p>
<p>We will do a release Party
in Oct. to Coincide with our 4 year anniversary.</p>
<p>This should give us
plenty of time to deal with any problems that might arise. Also, if everything gets
done ahead of schedule, you can just get your stuff that much sooner.</p>
<p><b>How Can I help?</b></p>
<p>The first and foremost way you can help out is donating. Even
If you can only donate $5 you will be involved in the decision making which
includes helping choose colors and designs for the products and helping make
decision on store improvement.  If you
can’t donate, then we can use your help spreading the word and getting others
to donate.  Also, if you’re an artist you
can create submissions for our T-shirt Design contest and possibly see your
work on our final products. (<a href=""http://rainydayanime.com/events/art-contest/)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://rainydayanime.com/events/art-contest/)</a></p><p>And finally, by just spreading the word about the

Enjoying touch of modern luxury and thriving on a demanding, active lifestyle.  This is how the idea of our carbon Pulo Luxury Wallet was born. First we designed it for ourselves and we quickly came to love it. Our friends liked it too and started to ask about it. The look, the style, the functionality and finally an ability to carry all your cards and bills with your pockets flat. Saying goodbye to bulges. And saying hello to fit for purpose, carbon design look. Pulo is only 0.16 inches (4mm) thin, which brings an end to the bulge in your pocket made by your old wallet.Pulo is CNC milled from the high quality carbon fiber – a material 3 times lighter and 5 times stronger than steel – used for making supercars, modern yachts and road bikes. Pulo is incredibly light and stylish as well as incredibly easy to use – which makes it a perfect companion for a demanding, active lifestyle. Pulo has no metal or magnetic parts, so it let's you fly through security gates at the airport and is 100% safe for your cards.Pulo holds from 1 to 15 credit cards inside, plus notes with the money clip on the back. Because of the carbon fiber properties, the money clip will always go back to its natural position.To make our Pulo even a more versatile companion we built in two additional features of bottle opener and media stand.

<h3>Aristotle Muse</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>In January of 2011, Carla lost her job at an energy billing provider in Alpharetta, GA. From that moment on she realized that she wasn't fully using the gifts and talents that she had nor was she putting to use an idea that she had come up with several years ago. Most women carry a handbag. Most women hate something about their handbag. So, she started asking questions about handbags. From that moment on Aristotle Muse was born. Aristotle does the thinking, the pondering and the detail work. The Muse is a childlike character who is always seeking an adventure at every single turn and needs something to carry Aristotle's ideas. Hence, the multi-bag, named after one of Carla's muses, Koko was born. Each bag is crafted with a minimalist aesthetic in mind but, fills a very feminine function. The place where a woman keeps her ""secrets"". Have you ever lost your lip gloss in the bottom of the bag right when you needed it to capture that hottie's eye? It's there at the flick of a wrist. Have you ever needed a pen but, it too was somewhere mixed with your makeup, perfume, notebooks and stuff? We got that covered!  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Do your keys get lost? Clipped. Does your strap fall off your shoulder? Not happening. What about that camera you carry around? Did you need a pocket for that? It's in the bag! What I don't have is the startup money that I need to get these bags into your hands where your life will be organized and you have two bags buy purchasing only one bag. Ladies, this is not a reversible bag. No, no we do this with style and grace! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Gentlemen, you are included this venture. Yes, the Muse thought of you as well. Do you know what this handbag does for you life? It makes you into a happier man. How? Well, your friend, girlfriend, wife, companion, even your friend with benefits will no longer be complaining about how her handbag just doesn't work right. Ah, yes, serenity. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>1) You give me a job. And not just a job but, a job that lets me give YOU the handbag that you've ALWAYS wanted but have never been able to purchase. Until October. :)</p>
<p>2) You stop handbag insanity in your town. You create sanity in your own world by being able to purchase these bags. Can you feel the Zen? Oh yeah, that's some handbag love right there. The Muse said so! </p>
<p>3) A foundation will be established from the sale of these bags for microfunding businesses for women in the US and abroad.</p>
<p>4) You will employ people in New York. My manufacturer is a family owned business and the handbags will be manufactured right here in the United States. No imports.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We will need approximately $5,000 to get the business just off the ground. What does this mean?</p>
<p>-Sample Bag</p>
<p>-Preliminary Orders</p>
<p>-Incorporation</p>
<p>-Business Licenses</p>
<p>-A Website</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Why are these things important?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>You dream about fashion. You breathe style. You may be a hipster, a romantic, a preppy or just a you. You may be a muse. You are a sophisticate who expects more out of her life, her experiences and her handbag. Who has the handbag? Aristotle Muse. How do we get that handbag to you? Through your contributions. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Why Aristotle Muse?</p>
<p>The company will be run on a sustainable business model. Not only a business model, but, the materials will be ethically sourced and sustainable.  This means as little plastics as possible. You might say, ""How are cows sustainable?"" Well, they still reproduce. The last time I checked, the dinosaurs died some billion odd years ago. Have you seen a T-Rex lately? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Twitter, Facebook and word of mouth. Let's give the Muse wings. This company is not about me but, what you need. You need Koko. Trust me, she's gorgeous. You get a main bag and a take away bag for the price of one bag. Who can beat that deal?  </p>

<h2>Send Baby To North Carolina:</h2>
<p>             Well hello there, Its me Alec, or as most of Madera knows me as... Baby. I am a 16 year old Junior at Madera High School in California. Im a 3 sports athlete, Im a football player, a wrestler, and a baseball player. This past year as a sophomore I did incredible things for Madera High. On the football field, I rushed over 1,000 yards with multiple interceptions on defense, on the wrestling mat, I captured a 6th place medal at The California State Tournament and also attended a national tournament in Reno Nevada and thats where I recieved my very first national title. Now on the baseball field. Me and another amazing pitcher lead Madera High to its first Valley Title in over 17 years! I've recieved multiple letters for wrestling from colleges, such as Old Domion, Columbia, and The Great Cal Poly, my dream college. So as a fan, you have 1 question that seems to be brought up more often than not...</p>
<h3>What sport are you trying to be successful in?</h3>
<p>               Trust me, it is harder than it looks to just pick one sport and forget the other 2. so basically we look at the sport that leads you with a better future..</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Wrestling:</h3>
<p>     Ive been wrestling since I was 6 years old. I grew up with wrestling all around me. My dad was a wrestler and my 3 older brother were wrestlers, so its pretty obvious what I was doing as soon as I came out of the womb. So my very 1st tournament ever at 6 years, I took 3rd place. pretty good right? so I went on to my next tournament the following weekend, I ended up taking the 1st place trophy after defeating 5 kids. Now thats awesome! okay now heres the cool part...</p>
<p>             My dad loves to take my brothers and his wrestling team to Reno,NV to wrestle at the Cliff Keen World of Wrestling National Tournament. well since I was barely getting into wrestling my dad said, ""well hell, might as well throw baby in there!"" so as a kid barely coming off of 2 little tournaments and now going to one of the hardest tournaments in the world! it was kind of.. scary. So as the tournament goes on.. my brothers are wrestling.. winning some and losing some.. and at one point they were put out of the tournament.. so they ask, ""hows baby doing?"" ......... Baby is now 4-0 wrestling for a national title! everyone was shocked. now at this point, we were planning on going home because my brothers were put out of the tournament and its baby's 3rd tournament ever, how could he possibly place.. So now the worry isnt about staying another night.. the worry is money... we had a few bucks left from the whole weekend.. we didnt know what to do. so my dad asked a friend to wire him money so it took awhile. in the meantime, Me, My dad, and my 2 brothers were sitting in the parking lot of the 99 cent store eating ham sandwiches. Wait huh? yeah thats right. while my opponent was probably eating a 5-course meal, in a fancy hotel, with a king size bed. I was sitting in the parking lot of the 99 cent store eating sandwiches..WOW.. so we ended up getting a little motel and staying the night and wrestling the next day. I wont tell you how the match went, but lets just say I recieved a beating Lol. so as a very talented wrestler growing up winning multiple tournaments how could I not want to go to college for wrestling right?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Football:</h3>
<p>     Football has always been the sport to recieve multiple attention.. I started when I was in the 3rd grade. growing up, I wasnt the all star football player like how I was the all star wrestler, I was the kid who got in on a few tackles and nevered played offense.. so when my 7th grade year is when I started playing offense. running the ball and becoming a terrific running back that the whole town was talking about me. so at the end of my 8th grade year everyone was asking what high school I was going to since there are 2 located in my town. I ended up going to the REAL Madera High and playing football for them. Im on my way to be a 4-year varsity player and as a freshman I threw a touchdown in a varsity game. 1st ever to do that for Madera High. so my sophomore year I came in as a starter on the offense running the ball to averaging about a little over a 100 yards a game. so as a star football player why not go to college for it?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Baseball:</h3>
<p>     I have been playing baseball my whole life. it is the sport I enjoy the most. growing up playing baseball with friends seem to be better than anything in the world. practices werent in a small compact room for hours with sweat everywhere, or at a field where concussions happen almost everyday, it was the field where you could rob a homerun during batting practice and everyone at practice going crazy and then after practice go over to a friends house for the night and do it again the next day. baseball has always had that impact on me. so as I was growing up, it started to becoming serious. Im left-handed pitcher that can put velocity on that ball! so in high school is where I started going to, showcases, big tournaments, college game days, etc. I have been getting told from multiple people that I have a huge chance of making it to the next level. So as a lefty pitcher, almost hitting 90mph as a sophomore, how could I now want to go to college?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Big Picture:</h2>
<p>       So me and my parents are thinking... wrestling? how far does wrestling get you? it only gets you an education and then your done. football? yeah football goes on after college, but what are the chances of you getting seriously injured? baseball...baseball.. well... that was when we came to the point on how could I go wrong with baseball? so for the past several months Ive been focusing my time on baseball and attending multiple events. so just recently I got invited to go to North Carolina to attend this national tournament and possibly play on the USA baseball team. my parents have been doing so much for me lately and I am so grateful for it. but this trip coming up is more money than we expected.. for me and my family to go to North Carolina and have a good time and not worry about anything, I will have to raise about $5,000. I have dreams that yet to be fulfilled and if you help me with this campaign, you can possibly help me achieved those dreams. and to all my donators I have something that I will do for them to let them be recognized for helping me through this tough time. If we dont achieve my goal, with all the money left over I plan on using it for future baseball events and equipment such as a bat, a glove, cleats, a bag and etc. So what this whole thing about was to show you what type of person I am so I can get you to realize that you are helping out a great cause. Im sure you know what its like to do something youve really wanted to do but couldnt afford it because you didnt have the money at the time.. so all im asking is for you to take consideration in the campaign and help me achieve my dream. I thankyou in advance for helping me out greatly. Thankyou so much!</p>

</div></div>","Send Baby To North Carolina:
             Well hello there, Its me Alec, or as most of Madera knows me as... Baby. I am a 16 year old Junior at Madera High School in California. Im a 3 sports athlete, Im a football player, a wrestler, and a baseball player. This past year as a sophomore I did incredible things for Madera High. On the football field, I rushed over 1,000 yards with multiple interceptions on defense, on the wrestling mat, I captured a 6th place medal at The California State Tournament and also attended a national tournament in Reno Nevada and thats where I recieved my very first national title. Now on the baseball field. Me and another amazing pitcher lead Madera High to its first Valley Title in over 17 years! I've recieved multiple letters for wrestling from colleges, such as Old Domion, Columbia, and The Great Cal Poly, my dream college. So as a fan, you have 1 question that seems to be brought up more often than not...
What sport are you trying to be successful in?
               Trust me, it is harder than it looks to just pick one sport and forget the other 2. so basically we look at the sport that leads you with a better future..
 
Wrestling:
     Ive been wrestling since I was 6 years old. I grew up with wrestling all around me. My dad was a wrestler and my 3 older brother were wrestlers, so its pretty obvious what I was doing as soon as I came out of the womb. So my very 1st tournament ever at 6 years, I took 3rd place. pretty good right? so I went on to my next tournament the following weekend, I ended up taking the 1st place trophy after defeating 5 kids. Now thats awesome! okay now heres the cool part...
             My dad loves to take my brothers and his wrestling team to Reno,NV to wrestle at the Cliff Keen World of Wrestling National Tournament. well since I was barely getting into wrestling my dad said, ""well hell, might as well throw baby in there!"" so as a kid barely coming off of 2 little tournaments and now going to one of the hardest tournaments in the world! it was kind of.. scary.

They got easily dirty or damaged through the constant process of taking them on and off throughout the day. And when I tried attaching them to an eyewear strap around my neck, the glasses got tangled up and in the way.</p><p>A large percentage of the world's population depends on wearing reading glasses or sunglasses throughout the day. But the constant process of handling eyewear can be frustrating. Wouldn't it be nice to have access to your lenses when you need them, but not have to think about where they are when you don't? And what about switching them in and out within the blink of an eye and with only one hand? With FlipSee, your glasses are always <em>just a flip away</em>.</p><h4>THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION TO HANDLING YOUR GLASSES</h4><p>FlipSee enables you to flip your glasses up into a fixed position above your eyes when you aren't using them, and back in front of your eyes when you are. The flipping process is fast and easy; you can do it with one hand, and you know at any time where your glasses are.</p><p>FlipSee consists of an elastic cord that hangs from behind your neck, and modified and patent-pending nose pads. The elastic cord has an easy-to-use pull-stop mechanism to keep your glasses resting comfortably on your forehead. The cord is equipped with elastic grips, which easily attach to the temples of the glasses. The modified nose pads make the glasses rest comfortably on your forehead without causing pain, while the friction between the pad and the skin prevents the glasses from sliding down on your nose and reduces the pain and pressure from original nose pads. The nose pads come with peel-off tabs so you can easily stick them onto the nose pads of your glasses.</p><p>FlipSee can be attached to your own glasses. The elastic cord combined with the cord-stop helps to secure your glasses at all times, even when you are active with labor work or other exercise, like running, jumping, biking or swimming in the ocean. Also, the cord-stop allows you to loosen the cord and let the glasses rest on your chest when you do not need them for a while.</p><p>FlipSee works for any type of glasses, whether it is reading glasses, sunglasses or fit-overs, safety glasses, anti-reflection glasses, or internet glasses. It has a discrete appearance, and is almost totally hidden, especially behind longer hair. Try them for yourself, or give it as a gift to your spouse, parent, grandparent or friend. </p><h3>Testimonials by Prototype Users</h3><p><em>I only need glasses for seeing up close. As a professional speaker and success coach, I spend 5+ hours a day working on my computer and reading. Ever since I started using my FlipSee I have saved valuable time from looking to see where I put my glasses down last. I know exactly where they are, and they don't fall off my head and break anymore!</em> </p><p>Dr Ron Eccles, Lakewood Range, FL</p><p><em>Thank you, FlipSee, for a simple solution to an annoying problem.</em><span><em> I have to remove my glasses so often to look at something up close, whether reading a fine print label or applying eyeliner. I always wanted to rest my glasses on my forehead, but they would slide down. I couldn’t put them on my top of my head because they would tangle in my hair. I was constantly fumbling with where to set my glasses and worried I would remember where they were! Now all I have to do is a quick Flip!</em></span></p><p>Michelle Schwenneker, Hixton, WI</p><p><em>As an avid year-round fly fisherman with declining eyesight, reading glasses have become part of my necessary gear. I have found it to be a burden struggling with where to store my reading glasses and fumbling around with them while on the stream fearing I would drop and lose them in the stream…until I discovered FlipSee. Now I can conveniently and comfortably flip them down off my brow when I need them and then flip them back up while fishing. Plus…less handling means less smudging and better chance to thread my line through the small eyes of my flies.</em></p><p>Keith Torok, Newtown, PA</p><p><em>I tried these and they work great. Cool stuff.</em></p><p>Jim Martin, Lumberton, NJ</p><p><em>I spend most of my days in front of a computer, reading or writing. I've gone through many pairs of reading glasses, too numerous to count - and costly. I found that FlipSee offers a natural feeling, is easy to use and I always know where my glasses are. I'm tall and live in an older house with low ceilings. I've also bent a number of glasses previously due to low ceiling since I would wear them on top of my head. FlipSee alleviates that problem too.</em></p><p>Steve Price, NJ</p><p><em>I LOVE my FlipSee glasses. When I'm working in my garage or outside, it is great to have these so handy to quickly put in place when I need to do close work or read and instruction manual. They are always at my fingertips and one quick movement with one hand or just nodding quickly puts them in place when I need them. Great product!</em></p><p>Bill Jacobsen, Wirtz, VA</p><p><em>When I first saw the video and the intended application of the product, I thought to myself: ""Well, how is this any different from just flipping my glasses up and resting them on my forehead without the fancy elastic strap and softer than normal nose pads”? I must admit, my perception completely changed when I actually received the kit in the mail and tried it on for the first time.<br/><br/>I was very satisfied with the product, because the soft, gel-like nose pads felt very comfortable while resting on the forehead and did not leave indentations in the skin as is the case when resting glasses equipped with regular, factory nose pads. The elastic strap held the glasses securely in place just right, without exerting unnecessary tension. The product definitely offers added convenience and a peace of mind, ensuring the glasses will not fall off. Having recently lost a pair of my favorite glasses while zip-lining I can truly appreciate the invention. Great product!<br/></em><br/>Leonard Girsh, Southampton, PA</p><h3>Help us Kick Start the Production of FlipSee!</h3><p>The product has undergone several design and prototype iterations over a period of 3 years, and has been tested by several persons over several months. It is now ready for final production. Your contribution will be used in full to manufacture the first 5,000 units of FlipSee. The funding goal is based on manufacturing, assembly, and packaging quotes received from US companies. Some of these will be sent out to the supporters. The remaining units will be sold online, and the entire profit from this sale will go back into design adjustment and a second production run. </p><h3>What Your Support Will be Used for</h3><p>We ask for $13,500 to manufacture the first 5,000 units of FlipSee and set up the production process. Manufacturing involves injection molding of rubber and silicone parts, extrusion of rubber cord, assembly and packaging. All manufacturing will be done in the US. </p><p><strong>If we surpass the funding goal</strong> we will use the additional funding to improve the design, in particular on the nose pads to eliminate any possible indentation on the forehead after prolonged use. We will also automate part of the assembly and packaging process to lower production cost. A longterm goal is to build the modified nose pads onto glasses, making them FlipSee ready.</p><p>If we do not reach the funding goal, the funds will still be used for manufacturing FlipSee, although we will be able to make fewer units than targeted and at a higher unit price. You are free to donate any amount you are comfortable with.</p><h3>Our Thank-You Gift</h3><p>For a contribution of $15 or more you will receive a FlipSee in the mail, and be among the pioneering group of people wearing the product, making handling of your glasses a whole new experience. </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>As an engineer with 35 years of experience and more than two dozen U.S. patents, I wanted to solve a problem encountered daily by myself and a large part of the world's population. I have designed FlipSee in a way that will transform people's experience with their eyewear, and with functionality, simplicity and discrete appearance in mind. I wear them daily and all throughout the day - not because I developed them, but because they solved my problem and met my need.</p><p>FlipSee allows you to: </p><ul>

Then the rapid growth of the body positive and sex positive movements brought us new examples of the beauty and sensuality of unique bodies both like and unlike ours. <strong> We saw bodies with full tummies, gender fluidity, thick thighs, flat chests, straight waists, all shapes of people who had been told they couldn’t be beautiful because of their bodies, being accepted and powerfully sensual.  These bodies were not beautiful in spite of their uniqueness, but BECAUSE of it.  </strong></p><p>Our self-love grew along with our knowledge and experience. We wanted lingerie that allowed us to express our passion, our sexuality, and our power. When we couldn't find it in stores we designed and made it ourselves.

We will be able to produce a whole new line of pieces and to take them to events and continue filling orders quickly to our exacting standards.</p><p>We have a whole host of wonderful perks for all budgets. You can choose what works best for you. The perks benefit you and us! With each perk of a lingerie item, we will ask for your measurements and make the pieces to your specifications. This will help us expand and refine our universal sizing method! See them in more detail to the right in the Perks section.</p><p>If we don’t reach our full goal the money will go first towards fulfilling the perks and then we are prioritizing marketing. Our goal is growth so that the business can become self sustaining. Photo and video shoots are not cheap, even with all the amazing people willing to donate their time.</p><h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2><p>With the expansion of Bawdy Love we will be able to create intersectional lingerie for everyone, of every size, shape, gender, ethnicity.

The variety of human shapes and sizes is vast.  We are dedicated to gathering as much information as possible and continuously analyzing it for patterns in fit, comfort and practicality. We have been making clothing, in many forms and styles, for decades and have amassed a huge amount of knowledge on how to create pieces for a variety of people.</p><p>We design our pieces from this lifetime of knowledge and believe the more information we gather about peoples measurements and shapes, the more we will be able to identify trends in how to fit and flatter all shapes.</p><p>We envision an extremely precise sizing method that accommodates every unique body, regardless of size, height, and shape to create pieces that are practically custom.  Through this method anyone who’s felt underserved by the existing fashion industry now has the keys to their own sensuality.</p><p>Our other large risk is simply not being able to keep up with demand. At the moment Bawdy Love consists of Candace, Gwynedh, and a select few and invaluable volunteers. We want very much to expand and hire so that we can fill orders more quickly but also so we can create all the new designs that are constantly pouring out of us. Labor is expensive, training is expensive, and we require high quality sewing. If we can reach our stretch goal we will be able to hire to keep up with demand and grow.</p><h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2><p>We appreciate all help, not just donations!

You can choose what works best for you. The perks benefit you and us! With each perk of a lingerie item, we will ask for your measurements and make the pieces to your specifications. This will help us expand and refine our universal sizing method! See them in more detail to the right in the Perks section.If we don’t reach our full goal the money will go first towards fulfilling the perks and then we are prioritizing marketing. Our goal is growth so that the business can become self sustaining. Photo and video shoots are not cheap, even with all the amazing people willing to donate their time.The ImpactWith the expansion of Bawdy Love we will be able to create intersectional lingerie for everyone, of every size, shape, gender, ethnicity. We want to bring out the sexiness and beauty in every body.When you contribute, you are also supporting a small, women-owned business with values that are rooted in supporting and uplifting women, people of color, and the LGBTQ+ community.Risks & ChallengesUniversal sizing isn’t simple. The variety of human shapes and sizes is vast.  We are dedicated to gathering as much information as possible and continuously analyzing it for patterns in fit, comfort and practicality. We have been making clothing, in many forms and styles, for decades and have amassed a huge amount of knowledge on how to create pieces for a variety of people.We design our pieces from this lifetime of knowledge and believe the more information we gather about peoples measurements and shapes, the more we will be able to identify trends in how to fit and flatter all shapes.We envision an extremely precise sizing method that accommodates every unique body, regardless of size, height, and shape to create pieces that are practically custom.  Through this method anyone who’s felt underserved by the existing fashion industry now has the keys to their own sensuality.Our other large risk is simply not being able to keep up with demand. At the moment Bawdy Love consists of Candace, Gwynedh, and a select few and invaluable volunteers. We want very much to expand and hire so that we can fill orders more quickly but also so we can create all the new designs that are constantly pouring out of us. Labor is expensive, training is expensive, and we require high quality sewing. If we can reach our stretch goal we will be able to hire to keep up with demand and grow.Other Ways You Can HelpWe appreciate all help, not just donations!

<p>As an inventor, I'm known for my stove designs, specifically the Original and the Nano Firebox Camping Stoves but I'm always exploring ideas. So when the minimalist wallet revolution started I perked up and became very intrigued! I tried several designs, some I bought and some I made. While I liked keeping everything in my front pocket I didn't like removing my cash to make payment always setting my wallet on the counter or holding it under my arm.  I really wanted to be able to work directly from my wallet and with some privacy all while maintaining the compact thin design of the most popular front pocket wallets. That became the challenge, A thin working wallet! </p>
<p>The wallets I tried generally had some sort of tension holding the bills and cards, but when I would try to remove just one bill others would come with it and putting my change back didn't work at all. I found myself removing all of my cards or cash way too often. I finally realized that I needed to let go of the conventional standard of everything being held with some kind of resistance. By giving both my cards and my bills some wiggle room, I can shuffle through my cards in place and I can remove or replace a single bill without affecting the rest. Voila! It really works! My daughter recommended that I tuck in the tongue, I found that doing so tightened everything up so in the end everything is still held very securely! Remove the tongue and everything loosens up and becomes very easy to work with.</p>
<p> It's so beautifully simple!  (Patent Pending)</p>
<p>It was designed for the US Dollar and standard credit card sizes.  Many international banknotes also fit. See size references below.</p>
<p>The wallet tongue is 70mm wide and will hold bills up to 178mm. </p>

My name is Kaity Rathman and I design and make womens clothing for Kaity Rathman Designs.
This campaign is very exciting for me because I've been invited to showcase my work in New York for PLITZS New York Fashion Week.  This is very important to me as a person, designer, and artist to further my career goals as a fashion designer.  Overall, this opportunity will help me get my name out there as a designer and kick start my career.
By contributing to this project, you will be helping me fly to NY, represent the midwest, help me meet and network with professionals in the industry, and this opportunity even has the possibility of finding investors to launch my brand!



What I Need & What You Get
This entire process is expensive and any amount donated will be greatly appreciated. I am working to get to at least $2,000. This money will go toward the following: • Venue, staging, and Lighting• Up to 50 looks• Up to 50 professional models assigned from the PLITZS Model Pool• Invitation to the Media and Press Release• Inclusion on Event Website with Brand Profile and link to Designer’s web page• Photos, Hair, and Makeup• Attendance to one scheduled model fitting prior to the show• Dressers to assist the designer backstage and during the show• Travel expenses, shipping of garments, and hotel.
By donating specific amounts I will be providing perks such as hand made accessories, discounts on my etsy shop, and credit for being a fantastic supporter on my social media sites.
If funds are not met, the money will still continue to go toward this trip to NY.  I am very determined and passionate about making this happen.  Again, any amount will go a very long way and I can't tell you how much it means to me.



Why Should You Send Me To New York?
I have seven years of retail experience, two years of management experience, six years of visual merchandising experience, and I have participated in nine fashion shows within the Midwest, including Kansas City Fashion Week.  I interned with Nicole Miller during the summer of 2012 in New York City within the production department ... And I have a hunger for more!  I have a passion for my craft and a drive for success.  With a strong work ethic, I am excited to represent the Midwest in a positive and fashionable light!
Other Ways You Can Help
 

If you are unable to contribute, please share this campaign with friends and family.  Lets make some noise for the Midwest!

<h1><strong>Our Story</strong></h1>
<p><strong>What if your panties could change the world?</strong> Now they can.</p>
Starting this year, we want to launch <strong>Cherie Amie</strong>, a not-so-ordinary<strong> lingerie company </strong>that empowers women to fight poverty - just by looking sexy in their knickers.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Why intimate apparel?</strong> We want to take something that represents so many things to so many people - beauty, elegance, self-indulgence, to name a few - and transform it into a poverty-eradicating, woman-empowering transaction that never stops giving. Ever.</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong>Watch our <a href=""http://landing.newsinc.com/shared/video.html?freewheel=91049&amp;sitesection=kdaf_hom_non_sec&amp;VID=23751103"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CW-33 news segment</a> to hear the story from us!</strong></div>
<div>
<h1><strong>How We Fight Poverty<br/></strong></h1>
</div>
<p>We plan to use our lingerie to lift women out of poverty in three sustainable ways. Read more below and visit <strong><a href=""http://www.besexybuyfair.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.besexybuyfair.com</a></strong> to learn more about how we plan to change the world - in style.</p>
<h3><strong>1. We Help Women Start Businesses</strong></h3>
<p>As a <strong>Good Returns</strong> company, we'll contribute 100% of our end-of-year profits to qualifying nonprofits that make interest-free micro-loans (average size: $100 to $150) to women in poverty around the world. These borrowers typically start businesses, invest in livestock for their farms, or pay for continuing education. Under the Good Returns model, virtually all of our profits will return to us after one year in service.</p>
<h3><strong>2. We Treat Our Artisans Well </strong></h3>
<p>All of our lingerie is uniquely produced by artisans in Cameroon, West Africa. As a <strong>fair-trade</strong> company, we'll accordingly provide fair wages to our artisans under fair conditions. That means every woman under our roof gets a say in management, receives access to a just confliction resolution process, and benefits from above-market pay. <strong>Hence our tagline: Be Sexy. Buy Fair.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>3. We Invest in Peace</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to microfinance and fair trade, we plan to contribute 10% of our net income to <strong>Peace Tree Africa</strong>, our 501(c)3 tax-exempt nonprofit arm, which finances sustainable development projects across sub-Saharan Africa. Peace Tree Africa subsidizes 75% of the costs for projects and requires 25% in contributions from participating communities. <strong><a href=""http://www.peacetreeafrica.org/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click here"">Click here</a></strong> to learn more.</p>

<div>
<h1><strong>Your Contribution </strong></h1>
<p>With your help, we'll be able to test-drive intimate apparel from sub-Saharan Africa for a Western audience. Our co-founder, Tara, will use less than one-seventh of the funds to travel to Cameroon to start production with our artisans in October. We expect to roll out the lingerie and sell it online in time for the Christmas holiday season.</p>
<h1><strong>Your Perk</strong></h1>
<p>We want to reward you in a memorable way for taking a chance on fair-trade lingerie. To that end, we will woo you with memorable dedication videos, postcards and calendars that feature <strong>Our Fair Ladies</strong> (below), and sexy lingerie you can slip into with purpose.</p>

Our Story
What if your panties could change the world? Now they can.
Starting this year, we want to launch Cherie Amie, a not-so-ordinary lingerie company that empowers women to fight poverty - just by looking sexy in their knickers.
 

Why intimate apparel? We want to take something that represents so many things to so many people - beauty, elegance, self-indulgence, to name a few - and transform it into a poverty-eradicating, woman-empowering transaction that never stops giving. Ever.
 
Watch our CW-33 news segment to hear the story from us!

How We Fight Poverty

We plan to use our lingerie to lift women out of poverty in three sustainable ways. Read more below and visit www.besexybuyfair.com to learn more about how we plan to change the world - in style.
1. We Help Women Start Businesses
As a Good Returns company, we'll contribute 100% of our end-of-year profits to qualifying nonprofits that make interest-free micro-loans (average size: $100 to $150) to women in poverty around the world. These borrowers typically start businesses, invest in livestock for their farms, or pay for continuing education. Under the Good Returns model, virtually all of our profits will return to us after one year in service.
2. We Treat Our Artisans Well 
All of our lingerie is uniquely produced by artisans in Cameroon, West Africa. As a fair-trade company, we'll accordingly provide fair wages to our artisans under fair conditions. That means every woman under our roof gets a say in management, receives access to a just confliction resolution process, and benefits from above-market pay. Hence our tagline: Be Sexy. Buy Fair.
3. We Invest in Peace
In addition to microfinance and fair trade, we plan to contribute 10% of our net income to Peace Tree Africa, our 501(c)3 tax-exempt nonprofit arm, which finances sustainable development projects across sub-Saharan Africa. Peace Tree Africa subsidizes 75% of the costs for projects and requires 25% in contributions from participating communities. Click here to learn more.


Your Contribution 
With your help, we'll be able to test-drive intimate apparel from sub-Saharan Africa for a Western audience. Our co-founder, Tara, will use less than one-seventh of the funds to travel to Cameroon to start production with our artisans in October. We expect to roll out the lingerie and sell it online in time for the Christmas holiday season.
Your Perk
We want to reward you in a memorable way for taking a chance on fair-trade lingerie. To that end, we will woo you with memorable dedication videos, postcards and calendars that feature Our Fair Ladies (below), and sexy lingerie you can slip into with purpose.

Garments from left to right: Ready Teddy, Bonsoir Baby Doll with Untie Me panties, and Humanitarian Hottie panties
While some rewards are instantaneous, others will take time, and vary by contribution. We will send our lingerie to recipients who contribute $10, $25, $50, $75, $200, $300, or $500 by November. If your name is featured in a PRNewswire press release, note that we'll send it after we reach our goal in August. Please contact us directly if you want to contribute at any level more than $2,000.

<p>Dear Supporters, </p>
<p>We spent 3 years, pouring our heart and soul into bringing Ace Marks to life. <b>Last year, we launched our first Kickstarter campaign and the love we felt from the Kickstarter community was overwhelming.</b> We are super excited to share our latest shoes with you first!</p>
<p>Making our second collection was no easy task, and we spent many weeks at our factory designing and developing shoes that will make you look good and feel powerful every time you put them on. When you receive your first pair of Ace Marks shoes, it will be clear to you that <b>we accomplished our goal</b>. Now we just need you to help us bring our second collection to life.</p>
<p>From the start, it was also very important to us that Ace Marks makes a strong impact on our community. With so many men and women struggling to support their families, we want to do our part to help them overcome at least one of the obstacles that they are facing, which is to find meaningful employment. That is why we partnered with Career Gear and implemented our buy back program. This past year, we were proud to <b>donate over $15,000 in shoes </b>to help men make an impact on their communities. We hope that our shoe donations will help thousands of men take their first steps into a brighter future.</p>
<p>With your help, we will <b>continue to grow Ace Marks</b> into a luxury lifestyle brand driven by a commitment to fine craftsmanship, beautiful aesthetics, and your happiness. It is for you, that we will continue to innovate and create.</p>
<p>Through our journey, we have learned that <b>Ace Marks is ultimately about empowerment</b>. We are empowering you with confidence and direct access to luxury statement shoes, and we are empowering men across the country to get back on their feet.</p>
<p><b>Thank you</b> for allowing us to do what we love and for spreading the word. <b>Share our campaign with the world</b>.</p>

</div></div>","The Italian craftsmen at Ace Marks are the same men and women who work for some of the most renowned luxury brands in the world. Their craftsmanship is deeply rooted in tradition and they have been thriving for four generations. Together, we created an attainable, handcrafted, ultra-luxury dress shoe that comes packed with features and is designed for comfort. Our factory's traditional construction is combined with our innovative design and bold attitude. Ace Marks shoes are built for the modern gentleman. Help us make our SECOND production!
 Whether you’re heading a startup or running a Fortune 500 company, Ace Marks shoes make a bold, powerful statement.

Ace Marks is the first and only luxury brand that will buy back its shoes. Indiegogo supporters will be able to send back their old Ace Marks for a $60 credit towards a new full priced pair purchased from our website. We partnered with Career Gear, a leading national organization helping men in need, to donate your old shoes and help men get back on their feet and re-enter the work force. Last year, we donated over $15,000 in luxury dress shoes to Career Gear! 

 


The Luke is a versatile dress shoe that can be worn for your Monday morning meeting, a casual night out and anything in-between. Decorative perforation and broguing details preserve tradition, and novel design curves bring this classic into today. These wingtips strike the perfect balance between traditional and modern.

 

The Kendrik can carry you through your daily office grind or accentuate your look at the local speakeasy. Whether you choose an understated color block or beautiful mono color look, these full brogue cap toes scream confidence with every step.

 
The Aron's contrasting materials and vibrant leather tones make a statement no matter how you pair them. Dressed up or dress down, it won't matter what you wear because all eyes will be on the monks.

 

The Greg is your best friend. Whether you're grabbing some drinks at a Hamptons soiree or getting better acquainted with your top producers, there's almost no look Greg can't enhance. The leather color combinations are just eccentric enough to be interesting, but not overpowering, and the suedes can make a pair of chinos look fancy.  

 

The Amit goes great with khakis, jeans, and with the right attitude, even a casual suit. Rendered in richly oiled leathers and furnished with a traditional tassel, the Amit fuses a classic preppy style with modern colors and materials.

On the Lorenzo, the beautiful hand antiquing and burnishing of the calf skin leathers truly stand out. The Lorenzo can smoothly transition from a day shoe paired with a suit to a powerful accent shoe worn with jeans.
 
 
 

 
 


 
ADD A MATCHING BELT TO YOUR PLEDGE +$80. Belts are all one length and can be cut to size. This can be done at home, or at a local shoe repair shop for a nominal fee. 

 

Each pair of Ace Marks dress shoes is made with full grain calf skin leather and is crafted, dyed, and burnished by hand. The manual process gives each pair its unique characteristics. Each pair goes through a rigorous inspection to ensure that every shoe is of the highest quality.

Our manufacturing process is done completely in-house. Each shoe takes great precision and skill to ensure the outcome is impeccable. 
 

 

No middlemen. No crazy markup. Just magnificent shoes at a magnificent price that we will buy back when you're ready for a new pair.

Our disruptive business model goes beyond cutting out the middle man to give our supporters direct to consumer pricing.

We created the Leave Your Marks program to activate the Ace Marks family and incentivize giving back. By sending back your worn Ace Marks Italian Luxury Statement shoes every time you buy a new full priced Italian luxury Statement shoe from www.acemarks.com, you, our Indiegogo supporters, not only get a $60 credit and a great reason to keep your shoe game fresh, you also participate in changing someone's life. 
To make sure that our shoe donations are put to good use, we partnered with Career Gear to donate them to help men in need enter the workforce, stay employed and become role models and mentors to their families and communities.
Ace Marks is the first and only luxury shoe company to do this!
Since our first campaign, we have donated over $15,000 in luxury shoes to CareerGear and we're excited to see how many more men we can help get back on their feet! 

 

When it comes to luxury, no matter how good your shoe looks, comfort is just as important. Ace Marks shoes are bold, flexible, and light. 

We spent 3 years in development to make sure that we get it right, and we spared no expense. Each pair is superbly handcrafted, hand burnished, and packed with features.   

That's why Ace Marks shoes:

Are made from hand-selected full-grain calf skin leather.  
Use a lightweight Blake Flex construction and leather outsole that allows for easy, effortless movement. 

Reduce common pressure points around the heel and mid-foot with our carefully constructed Ace last (a.k.a. forma). 

Relieve stress as you walk with a cushioned leather insole, which molds to your foot over time for added comfort. 
Are lined with supple calfskin leather to keep your feet dry and cool. 


 

Ace Marks was designed for the modern gentleman looking to step up his style and add a bit of swagger. The Ace Marks man is not afraid to be bold in his success.

Becoming one of our backers means much more than just buying a world class shoe at an amazing price. Each backer at any pledge level: 

Will be Added to our Ace Marks Elite to get exclusive access to limited run shoes and colors.
Will be able to sell their old Ace Marks Italian Luxury Statement shoes back to us for $60.

 

Our shoes go well beyond comfort and style. By cutting out the middlemen, we’re able to deliver the highest quality product at a market disruptive price. Luxury doesn't have to cost a small fortune.

Ace Marks shoes are statement shoes. They are well-made, attractive and eye-catching shoes that reflect your personality

Our designs are modern classics in unique color and material combinations and packed with features

Ace Marks is for the modern gentleman that appreciates craftsmanship and style.

Ace Marks Shoes are available from US size 5 to 14, including half sizes. They are available in 2 width options:
1) ""D"", medium/standard width cut generously around the midfoot and heel to prevent unnecessary pressure on the foot.
2) ""E"", wider than a ""D"" width, cut generously around the midfoot and heel to prevent unnecessary pressure on the foot.
Our shoes fit true to US Brannock sizing. Still, it will be VERY important that you follow our fitting & sizing instructions that we will send at the end of the campaign to get the best fit. 
If the size you order happens to not be the best fit, we will exchange it for you (please see DELIVERY section below for shipping charges on exchanges). 

 

 

Once the campaign is funded, we expect that it will take 2-3 weeks for us to send the survey and receive back the style, color, and size surveys from all backers. The faster we get them back the less likely any delays!
Production typically takes 8-10 weeks, and shipping approximately 3 weeks.
By December 2017, or sooner, we expect to be shipping to you from our facilities in the US and EU. 
 
We are very experienced in delivering shoes on time! We will do everything in our power to make sure we meet the timeline. 

If you order it, you will receive it! Every backer will receive his reward. 

Shipping is included for all shipments in the continental United States. 
However, if the need for an exchange arises, we will need to charge for the exchange shipping both ways as we are a startup and work with very small margins on Indiegogo. This is true for domestic & international orders. 
All exchange requests must be submitted within 30 days of receiving your reward. 
The cost of international shipping & VAT (if applicable) will be charged at the time of the survey once the campaign is over and will vary based on the destination country. You can see international shipping rates here. If applicable, duties and local taxes will be charged by the appropriate authority at the destination country. Please determine these charges locally.
Continental US & Canadian orders will ship from our facility in Miami, FL. 
All other orders will ship from our fulfillment center in the EU. Orders shipped within the EU will not incur customs duty charges but will be subject to VAT. 

Ace Marks wasn't created on a whim. It is the product of a lifetime of research and experience in the luxury footwear business.

Our founder, Paul, grew up traveling with his parents to Italy & Spain's shoe factories. Formally educated in International Finance & Marketing at the University of Miami, he and his brother Daniel, as their parents before them, have dedicated their lives to designing and producing luxury footwear of the highest quality. Their footwear experience ranges from designing & manufacturing to marketing, warehousing and logistics. They have done it all.
To assure that our supporters receive top notch service, we put together a team with extensive experience in footwear logistics and distribution. 
This is our second Crowdfunding campaign, and we are more prepared than ever to continue surpassing our backer's expectations. We are excited to share our new products and vision with the world!
 

 

Quality. We spent a lot of time finding the best artisans in Italy that have the materials, the facilities, the pedigree and, most importantly, the experience to create a world-class luxury shoe. We spared no expense to make sure that you will get only the best.
Affordability. By implementing a disruptive business model that delivers your shoes straight from the artisan's hands to your doorsteps, we eliminate the need for retailers, wholesalers, and other middlemen. The workmanship and luxury you will experience with our shoes is incomparable, at a price that is unparalleled. Less than $250 for a $600-$1,000+ shoe. We did it for YOU.
Communication. Your commitment to us is the start of a long, beautiful relationship. We are committed to you. We will keep our relationship strong by delivering amazing products and communicate with you every step of the way. You will get regular updates as we fund, produce, and ship out your one-of-a-kind shoes. If you have an itch to talk to us, just get in touch any time!  
Consistency. Every Ace Marks shoe is hand crafted and hand dyed, meaning that no two pairs are identical. However, each pair goes through a thorough inspection process to assure the quality you expect from a world-class luxury brand.
Experience & Reliability. Ace Marks was founded by a team with a lifetime of experience in the luxury footwear industry. We don't make commitments that we can't honor. We have the infrastructure to assure a smooth process from taking your order thru delivery. We want to be your go-to brand for all things men's luxury, and we will earn your confidence. 
We are building more than a shoe, we are building a family. The Ace Marks Family!

Dear Supporters, 
We spent 3 years, pouring our heart and soul into bringing Ace Marks to life. Last year, we launched our first Kickstarter campaign and the love we felt from the Kickstarter community was overwhelming. We are super excited to share our latest shoes with you first!
Making our second collection was no easy task, and we spent many weeks at our factory designing and developing shoes that will make you look good and feel powerful every time you put them on. When you receive your first pair of Ace Marks shoes, it will be clear to you that we accomplished our goal. Now we just need you to help us bring our second collection to life.
From the start, it was also very important to us that Ace Marks makes a strong impact on our community. With so many men and women struggling to support their families, we want to do our part to help them overcome at least one of the obstacles that they are facing, which is to find meaningful employment. That is why we partnered with Career Gear and implemented our buy back program. This past year, we were proud to donate over $15,000 in shoes to help men make an impact on their communities. We hope that our shoe donations will help thousands of men take their first steps into a brighter future.
With your help, we will continue to grow Ace Marks into a luxury lifestyle brand driven by a commitment to fine craftsmanship, beautiful aesthetics, and your happiness. It is for you, that we will continue to innovate and create.
Through our journey, we have learned that Ace Marks is ultimately about empowerment. We are empowering you with confidence and direct access to luxury statement shoes, and we are empowering men across the country to get back on their feet.
Thank you for allowing us to do what we love and for spreading the word. Share our campaign with the world.

How did the Winkers Project begin? 
THE BESPOKE SHOE STORY
As traditionally trained, bespoke (custom made) shoemakers we are really passionate about shoes. 

We both followed the traditional route to become handsewn shoemakers, by doing a four-year apprenticeship here in England, before launching our own business, Carreducker. Based in Bloomsbury, London, we've been hand stitching bespoke shoes for over 20 years for scores of discerning, stylish gentlemen from around the world.

We make each pair entirely from scratch. We start by taking a client's measurements.

Measuring the feet
Then their lasts are made - the wooden blocks we make the shoes on.

Bespoke (custom made) lasts
The shoes are designed on the lasts, patterns are made, leather is cut and the uppers stitched.

Bespoke boot pattern
After a couple of fittings the shoes are hand sewn.

Handsewing bespoke shoes
And delivered to the client with bespoke shoe trees.

Bespoke shoes and shoe trees
So when we say we know how to make a fantastic pair of shoes, we really do!
The Winkers Project
Over the years customers have asked us to make ready to wear shoes - something stylish, affordable and English-made - so that's how the Winkers project began.
Now we have finally put everything we know into making the Winkers Resort Shoe the perfect summer shoe.
Our keen eye for detail.

Choosing fabrics
Our expertise on a comfortable fit.

Developing the last
And our design skills.

Sketching
We have road tested various styles.

Winkers travelling the world - San Francisco

Winkers travelling the world - South of France

Winkers travelling the world - London

Winkers travelling the world - Italy

Winkers travelling the world - Jersey
Adjusted the design.


And improved the fit.

England has a great shoemaking heritage and we wanted to harness some of that shoemaking talent. So we are working with a small, family-run factory in the North of England to make this collection.

<p><strong>Hi everyone,<br/></strong></p>

<p><strong>it gives you a visual to sort of relate to how I frequently feel when I'm looking for clothing that will express who I am on the inside. I am not alone.<br/></strong></p>
<p>My name is Karen Roberts and I am co- owner of a business in Northern California. During the day, I work as a Realtor. I spend my evenings and weekends sketching and designing clothes that myself and my peers would <em>love</em> to be able to wear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am a professional woman that meets with the daily challenge of deciding what clothing I will wear to work each day to meetings or trainings that outwardly express who I am internally.I want my clothes to be better designed, self expressive and work for my lifestyle.</p>
<p>Finally...!</p>
<div>
<strong>Butch by Design offers a much needed service to women that choose their clothing based on how they feel inside.</strong> These women don't relate to dresses, feminine jumpsuits and skirts. They aren't even fond of blouses! Our revolutionary line of clothing is designed to be proportioned to fit a range of body shapes that empower women.</div>

<div>
<strong><em>Can you imagine Ellen in anything other than the way you see her dressed everyday?</em></strong> Fortunatley for her, she has the resources to have clothes made for her and stylists to locate clothes for her all over the world!

<div>I am asking for you to partner with us in launching the brand that will outfit, encourage and inspire a lifestyle of <strong>androgynous</strong> clothing for women that are lost without it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My dream is to design and produce a creative fashion line for these women to identify with... a sort of middle-sex styled collection of well made business and casual attire that offer great fit and promote confidence.With your help, we will be in the position to create more samples and start production for our Summer/Fall 2012 collection.</div>

<h3><strong> The Concept</strong></h3>
<div> </div>
<div>With your help, I would like to offer a unique line of quality clothing to our niche market via online shopping-led by promotional, incentive and organic online and offline marketing channels.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The goal is to create 3-6 prototype pieces at a time,have them manufactured and immediately send promotional attire to women like Ellen DeGeneres, Wanda Sykes, Rosie, k.d.Lang and countless other fabulous females. We want to establish Butch by Design as a fashion resource for women such as these.</div>

<div>We would offer the following services:</div>

</div>
<div><strong>Online Shopping</strong></div>
<div><strong>Onsite pop-up stores at large annual women's  functions</strong></div>
<div><strong>Event specific retail sales on Olivia Cruises</strong></div>

<p><strong>Who is the Butch by Design Client?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>The woman I design for loves who she is, she's proud and strong but maybe her oversized, drab colored, menswear doesn't show it. Or maybe she loves clothes, but she wants to live more consciously. Maybe she's always complaining about not having anything to wear even though she has a closet full of stuff, or maybe she's feeling her sense of confidence is drowning in the only fashion that she can <em>ALMOST</em> relate to. Butch by Design was designed to bridge the gap for these women, between their selves, styles, lifestyles, and values. To be honest, Butch by Design was designed with me in mind. I am that woman. And I know she might be you too or someone that  you know.<strong> Let's empower these women!<br/></strong></p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p><br/><br/> There is an absence in the marketplace right now for women that are in search of stylish, great fitting fashions.

<p>A portion of the money raised from this campaign will be used to complete the infrastructure of the company that has been funded through boot- strap methods to this point.

Hi everyone,
The picture before you is of me...
it gives you a visual to sort of relate to how I frequently feel when I'm looking for clothing that will express who I am on the inside. I am not alone.
My name is Karen Roberts and I am co- owner of a business in Northern California. During the day, I work as a Realtor. I spend my evenings and weekends sketching and designing clothes that myself and my peers would love to be able to wear.
 
I am a professional woman that meets with the daily challenge of deciding what clothing I will wear to work each day to meetings or trainings that outwardly express who I am internally.I want my clothes to be better designed, self expressive and work for my lifestyle.
Finally...!

Butch by Design offers a much needed service to women that choose their clothing based on how they feel inside. These women don't relate to dresses, feminine jumpsuits and skirts. They aren't even fond of blouses! Our revolutionary line of clothing is designed to be proportioned to fit a range of body shapes that empower women.
 

Can you imagine Ellen in anything other than the way you see her dressed everyday? Fortunatley for her, she has the resources to have clothes made for her and stylists to locate clothes for her all over the world! I want to manifest the reality of making our brand of clothing affordable, identifiable and accessible to any woman at any time.
 
 
 
          

 
I am asking for you to partner with us in launching the brand that will outfit, encourage and inspire a lifestyle of androgynous clothing for women that are lost without it.

We are starting to emerge and become a modern day outerwear company thanks to the help of our crowdfunding platforms Indiegogo and Kickstarter, our backers and retailers. Our niche is multi-use weatherproof fashion outerwear. We are in a very capital intensive industry with a niche group of products that serves our customers very well. To keep the costs down for affordability reasons, we need to make hundreds at at time. We hope that one day, one of these campaigns will not only support the project we are trying to finance, but maybe help finance the company so it can function more smoothly. This will help us emerge. Thank you in advance for taking a look at our latest campaign. I hope you are compelled to support it. For those that have backed previous campaigns, we thank you from the  bottom of our hearts, because you are the reason why we are in business and are starting to thrive. We are excited to ship our NEW FALL 19 STYLES starting at the end of August. Please see images at the bottom of the page.</figure><p> </p>

<h1>What Makes Our Coats So Special!</h1>
<p>Traditional performance jackets are sporty, touristy, labeled with large logos and can be really expensive. We have designed modern outerwear. Our coats are lighter and warmer and we are able to make natural fibers water and windproof such as cotton and wool. They are also comfortable windproof and come with a cozy, warm micro fleece lining, or soft mesh lining inside. We have a world class fashion designer insuring we are providing fashion forward, timeless designs so you can wear your favorite coat for many years to come. We also use high quality factories that provide good quality. And to top things off, we have made our coats affordable.</p>
<p>We have a<b> 100% customer satisfaction</b> and roughly 1 in 200 backers/customers return their coats. We are proud of our product!</p>
<p><b>Outer Street Fabric  - </b> It starts with the fabric we design. We design all our own fabrics from scratch. We offer a NEW softer wool blend, new cotton herringbone colors and weights, denim, jersey and of course cotton.</p>

<p><b>Special Thermal Membrane - </b>Bonded in-between the micro-fleece and wool is the secret to the coats performance. We insert a waterproof and windproof thermal membrane that deflects your body heat back towards your body. This allows for less material to accomplish the same amount of warmth performance. The membrane is also a wind barrier, keeping the wind chill out. This high-tech waterproof &amp; windproof membrane will always keep you warm and dry in the wind, snow, rain, or any of the other elements.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>DWR Coating - </b>DWR stands for durable water resistance and we apply this treatment to the outside of the coat. What this does, is help water bead off the coat instead of soaking through. Of course we have installed the state of the art high-tech membrane, but the DWR coating is the first line of defense to mother nature.</p>

<p><b>Fashion Design</b> - Our products are designed in Portland, Oregon where our head designer Nina Bucci also owns a boutique. From here we can test new designs and use customer insights to create better product. She takes the latest trends and gently softens our look to create timeless pieces that will stay fashion forward for years to come.</p>
<p><b>Light and Compact </b> Travel a lot or only need one coat because you live in a warmer place, then this is the coat for you. This is a very small carry on suit case and the coat barely takes up any space. As illustrated is our heaviest wool coat and it barely takes up any space. Travelling in other countries and you don't want to look like a tourist? Then get one of these and blend right in.</p>

<h3>The New Excursion Jackets - with NEW Purse Pocket</h3>
<p>We bring you the Excursion jackets. As we get feedback and images from our travel club, we know there is a need for us to make a supped up Mia Melon and OMO jacket. We have developed a new fabric that is really soft to touch, doesn't wrinkle easy when packed, has taped seams and a 10K/5K membrane with a DWR treatment. On the outside of the sueded cotton fabric is a special heat treatment known as a DWR (Durable Water Resistance) which is our first defense against mother nature. This treatment allows the water to bead off. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558825464/sfugchdlbjkqs8i2r9na.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>                                                         Taped Seams with 10k/5k membrane</p>
<p>We have been told that when you go on an excursion, you could use another pocket, so you don't need to bring your purse or bag along with you when on your favorite trail or out traveling the world. We are introducing the revolutionary ""purse pocket"" This miniature purse is large enough to hold your essentials such as cash, credit cards, passport, lipstick and make up. It snaps conveniently into the inside of your jacket and remains hidden and secure. Leave your purse or bag in the trunk of your car, hotel room or house and only bring  what you need on your excursion.</p>

<p>The Comfy 2</p>
<p>We brought you the Comfy through a previous Kickstarter campaign. This is a new extra-soft version with a teddy faux-fur lining instead of the mesh lining from the previous design.It has our standard membrane that is wind and waterproof and also has a DWR treatment. Compared to the Excursion jackets, it is more of a casual, laid back performance jacket that doesn't have the travel features but it incredibly cozy and is very fashionable. It's so comfy that you might even want to wear it inside while watching TV! :)</p>

<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>Thanks to your support we have done 10 successful campaigns all helping with our production. Most rewards have been delivered on time or sometimes early. As we grow, our production gets bigger, we have more quality concerns to deal with, and more can go wrong to cause late shipping. Especially when it is a really difficult fabric to develop. In the end, we always come through.</p>
<p>We are offering a number of styles and colors and some styles and colors may not be popular enough to produce. This does happen but not very much. If you do pick an unpopular style, we can substitute for a more popular style or even return your reward if necessary.</p>
<p>This new fabric in this project shouldn't have many challenges but there are a lot more details coming with the female jackets such as the purse pocket and the layering pieces. There isn't anything we are concerned about, just that there is more to mange and to arrive on time. We are planning to ship in October but we are scheduling the goods to arrive in September to give us a little cushion.</p>
<p>Once again, without your support we would not be here. We are hoping our new product group will be a home run.</p>

Sweet Clothing is a small company that designs and produces the brand names Mia Melon and One Man Outerwear. We are starting to emerge and become a modern day outerwear company thanks to the help of our crowdfunding platforms Indiegogo and Kickstarter, our backers and retailers. Our niche is multi-use weatherproof fashion outerwear. We are in a very capital intensive industry with a niche group of products that serves our customers very well. To keep the costs down for affordability reasons, we need to make hundreds at at time. We hope that one day, one of these campaigns will not only support the project we are trying to finance, but maybe help finance the company so it can function more smoothly. This will help us emerge. Thank you in advance for taking a look at our latest campaign. I hope you are compelled to support it. For those that have backed previous campaigns, we thank you from the  bottom of our hearts, because you are the reason why we are in business and are starting to thrive. We are excited to ship our NEW FALL 19 STYLES starting at the end of August. Please see images at the bottom of the page. 

 
What Makes Our Coats So Special!
Traditional performance jackets are sporty, touristy, labeled with large logos and can be really expensive. We have designed modern outerwear. Our coats are lighter and warmer and we are able to make natural fibers water and windproof such as cotton and wool. They are also comfortable windproof and come with a cozy, warm micro fleece lining, or soft mesh lining inside. We have a world class fashion designer insuring we are providing fashion forward, timeless designs so you can wear your favorite coat for many years to come. We also use high quality factories that provide good quality. And to top things off, we have made our coats affordable.
We have a 100% customer satisfaction and roughly 1 in 200 backers/customers return their coats. We are proud of our product!
Outer Street Fabric  -  It starts with the fabric we design. We design all our own fabrics from scratch. We offer a NEW softer wool blend, new cotton herringbone colors and weights, denim, jersey and of course cotton.
 
 
Inner Micro-fleece - The inside is a cozy and comfortable micro-fleece interior. It doesn't scratch and is very warm and comfortable.
 
Cozy Micro Fleece 
Special Thermal Membrane - Bonded in-between the micro-fleece and wool is the secret to the coats performance. We insert a waterproof and windproof thermal membrane that deflects your body heat back towards your body. This allows for less material to accomplish the same amount of warmth performance. The membrane is also a wind barrier, keeping the wind chill out. This high-tech waterproof & windproof membrane will always keep you warm and dry in the wind, snow, rain, or any of the other elements.

 
DWR Coating - DWR stands for durable water resistance and we apply this treatment to the outside of the coat. What this does, is help water bead off the coat instead of soaking through. Of course we have installed the state of the art high-tech membrane, but the DWR coating is the first line of defense to mother nature.

Water response from DWR Treatment
 
Sueded cotton - ***NEW FOR FALL 2019*** ""The Performance Plus series"" is made with our latest and newest custom fabric using a super soft sanded cotton, a 10000/5000 membrane in the middle layer and a cozy micro-fleece lining.

                                          Sueded Cotton with  additional zip venting
Fashion Design - Our products are designed in Portland, Oregon where our head designer Nina Bucci also owns a boutique. From here we can test new designs and use customer insights to create better product. She takes the latest trends and gently softens our look to create timeless pieces that will stay fashion forward for years to come.
Light and Compact  Travel a lot or only need one coat because you live in a warmer place, then this is the coat for you. This is a very small carry on suit case and the coat barely takes up any space. As illustrated is our heaviest wool coat and it barely takes up any space. Travelling in other countries and you don't want to look like a tourist? Then get one of these and blend right in.

The New Excursion Jackets - with NEW Purse Pocket
We bring you the Excursion jackets. As we get feedback and images from our travel club, we know there is a need for us to make a supped up Mia Melon and OMO jacket. We have developed a new fabric that is really soft to touch, doesn't wrinkle easy when packed, has taped seams and a 10K/5K membrane with a DWR treatment. On the outside of the sueded cotton fabric is a special heat treatment known as a DWR (Durable Water Resistance) which is our first defense against mother nature. This treatment allows the water to bead off. 

                                                         Taped Seams with 10k/5k membrane
We have been told that when you go on an excursion, you could use another pocket, so you don't need to bring your purse or bag along with you when on your favorite trail or out traveling the world. We are introducing the revolutionary ""purse pocket"" This miniature purse is large enough to hold your essentials such as cash, credit cards, passport, lipstick and make up. It snaps conveniently into the inside of your jacket and remains hidden and secure. Leave your purse or bag in the trunk of your car, hotel room or house and only bring  what you need on your excursion.



                                                    The purse-pocket holds all your essentials

It's quite scary to think about the amount of money we've thrown away or lost in the form of half-used plastic pens. Because of their disposable nature, we are careless with them. If we lose one, most likely we will get a whole new pack of them. That's why we wanted to create an ideal pen that fits perfectly into your everyday carry and is worth taking care of, especially for those who need their writing tools wherever they are. If you are like us looking for a pen that is more durable and lasting for everyday carry, BNdot is the perfect fit!

<p>We’re taking a leap into a world that we have lived in at big companies, and it’s been scary to try this by ourselves.  We know we can run a strong business in design and manufacturing, as we have done it before on a large scale, so we know what success looks like.  We do anticipate growing pains at the beginning as we’re starting small, focused, and using local suppliers.  We also don’t have as much experience with e-commerce!  Despite the challenge, we’re academics and learners at heart who have overcome challenges in the past.  </p>
<p>The most important thing is knowing our blind spots, and we have a network of experts who we can bring in to help us address the problems where we lack expertise.  We are 100% committed to making this work - we just need your support to prove we can get there.  Cash flow is the number one reason small businesses fail, and we want to make sure we have a track record of delivering to customers to ensure that we stay afloat.  Take the journey with us and become one of the Vita Few!  <br/></p>

We know the Indiegogo community appreciates thoughtful design, responsible sourcing, and comes together to rally around each other.  No joke, our brand mantra is ""Come Together!""  There is no community, online or otherwise, that more accurately reflects our young brand's values and who we are as a team.  



Our first buy will break down as follows:
Custom developed Cotton Modal Loop Terry - $4,700 
Cotton Tencel Body Fabric - $2,400
Water Resistant zippers are $459
Cut, Make, Trims $4,700
Screen burning for our 10 color print - $3,500 
We also need to cover the additional costs of our team who have 
been working tirelessly on web development, apparel and graphic design, 
product development, operations and logistics, and helping to build our 
social platforms! 





We’re taking a leap into a world that we have lived in at big companies, and it’s been scary to try this by ourselves.  We know we can run a strong business in design and manufacturing, as we have done it before on a large scale, so we know what success looks like.  We do anticipate growing pains at the beginning as we’re starting small, focused, and using local suppliers.  We also don’t have as much experience with e-commerce!  Despite the challenge, we’re academics and learners at heart who have overcome challenges in the past.  
The most important thing is knowing our blind spots, and we have a network of experts who we can bring in to help us address the problems where we lack expertise.  We are 100% committed to making this work - we just need your support to prove we can get there.  Cash flow is the number one reason small businesses fail, and we want to make sure we have a track record of delivering to customers to ensure that we stay afloat.  Take the journey with us and become one of the Vita Few!  
A wise man once said, “When you’re through learning, you’re through.”  We’re only at the beginning.

Warranty & ReturnsWe stand by our product, period.  If you don't like it for any reason, or some part of it fails, we will take back unworn product.  We will always find a reasonable solution. If it looks worn and reeks of B.O., you own it my friend.  
We know we’re asking a lot of people - $98 is a lot to spend on a shirt, even if it does help you dominate the day.  You can also help us by getting the word out, posting, sharing, and kerfuffling your Vitals off to help us get noticed! Indiegogo has some fantastic tools to help make this easier! As we get up and running, we will also be looking for brand ambassadors and influencers with whom we will collaborate, grow, and ultimately contribute to our communities.",40.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What Fashion Gone Rogue Needs &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The main goal for funding is to cover the costs of a new website server, maintenance and the addition of regular contributors.</p>
<p>Server Costs/Site Maintenance - Having a website that is heavily image-based takes a lot of bandwidth and requests to the server.  Over the years, I have upgraded numerous times, supplementing the costs with site advertising but with the demands of increased traffic, this has not been enough lately. Due to the nature of having a Wordpress site, which already uses a significant amount of memory with its many queries, with a lot of hits, the server has to deal with high PHP spikes.  This is even with having a cache in place.  Because of this, Fashion Gone Rogue requires dedicated server hosting with the most resources available. For server hosting and site optimization, the cost is $1,000 per month for a total of $12,000 per year.</p>
<p>Contributors - With your support, I can get regular contributors to go through submissions and post to the site.  This will also allow me the time to do more site features like interviews, trend reports, etc. The other $13,000 would be used for these contributors for an average budget of $1,100 a month.</p>

<p>We're here to provide you with a cool new way to mix and match sunglasses on your own terms. No screws and no hassles!</p>
<p>In the past, sunglasses have been contained to the boundary of being held together with hinges and screws. What we wanted to do was let people have the ability to easily make an entirely new combination  efficiently and ensure that the strength of the hinge was not affected. When other brands charge over $100 for just <strong>ONE</strong> pair of shades we want to offer the option of 16 combos with <strong>TWO</strong> pairs of the new fusion series. Hopefully this will level the playing field a bit!</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide a product that you love, makes you look great and doesn't hurt your bank account!</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/508/305/5d886a10d755e75bdecee19cecb5c39e_large.jpg?1365698805"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>We took our own product design experience and used our leading manufacturer to create prototypes and realize the vision. After a few weeks of refining the design, colors, and materials used in the line, we have found the perfect blend. The final product couples polarized polycarbonate lenses with a durable, lightweight, BPA-free frame. We have received such great reviews from the samples that we want to take it to the public!</p>
<p>The Fusion frames are made from BPA free injection-polycarbonate plastics that are durable and super lightweight. Each model has a hazy finish that gives it a really cool hue.</p>
<p>Instead of screws, the arms of the Fusions are held in place by a ball and hole joint that fit snuggly together. This allows the user to mix and match their shades easily and efficiently on the go. Don't worry about having to buy 5 pairs of sunglasses to have variety. With just 2 pairs of fusions you have the ability to make 16 pairs!</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/542/785/8e462056776cf0b74874f890f7f6074a_large.jpg?1366909854"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The main concerns for us during the prototype phase were:</p>
<p>1. The strength of the joint</p>
<p>2. The durability of the joint</p>
<p>In the past, we have seen similar models that would easily fall apart if you were wearing them while enjoying active sports. This was not acceptable. We tested many prototypes to get to the point where we are confident that the strength of the hinge will not be a problem. </p>
<p><strong>AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE VIDEO, WE THREW THEM DOWN FORCEFULLY  WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE OR HAVING THE ARMS COME OFF THE FRAME! THE STRENGTH OF THE HINGE HAS BEEN TESTED MANY TIMES TO ADHERE TO OUR REQUIREMENTS.</strong></p>
<p>The second concern was that the hinge wouldn't break when you interchanged the sides many times over. When we received the first samples they were not solid and after 50 tries they eventually broke. We went back to the manufacturer and told them the problem and we came up with a solution of a stronger polycarbonate plastic for the entire frame. There will be no stress fractures in these frames.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/542/799/494de8946009c65d634e2710e1fecb21_large.jpg?1366910160"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

<p>The frame is made from a durable, forgiving material that allows it to fit comfortably on your face while also avoiding stress fractures and other damage you see in cheaper frames. </p>
<p>We are using a trusted, leading manufacturer of frames and lenses which are hand assembled, polished, and packaged to our exact specifications. But we need your help to go from working prototype to full scale production. Your pledge will go towards production and high-strength steel moulds necessary for the factory to turn out the quality we want on a larger scale. If the goal is met and barring any setbacks we expect to be shipping these out to you by August 2013!</p>

<p>As you can see in the picture below - the male and female pieces snap into place and fit snuggly. We didn't want them coming apart easily but also wanted to make it simple for you to mix and match. The Nectar logo is also raised up from the frame which gives it a nice feel.</p>

<p>The male piece consists of two half ball bearings that snap exactly into place with the female piece. The design is made to maximize effeinncey  and provide for the best possible durability in regards to the way that you bend or what actiivity you are doing.</p>
<p><strong>Lenses on the Fusion model CAN be switched between the two frames - it's as simple as popping them out and snapping them back in!</strong></p>

We're here to provide you with a cool new way to mix and match sunglasses on your own terms. No screws and no hassles!
In the past, sunglasses have been contained to the boundary of being held together with hinges and screws. What we wanted to do was let people have the ability to easily make an entirely new combination  efficiently and ensure that the strength of the hinge was not affected. When other brands charge over $100 for just ONE pair of shades we want to offer the option of 16 combos with TWO pairs of the new fusion series. Hopefully this will level the playing field a bit!
Our goal is to provide a product that you love, makes you look great and doesn't hurt your bank account!

We took our own product design experience and used our leading manufacturer to create prototypes and realize the vision. After a few weeks of refining the design, colors, and materials used in the line, we have found the perfect blend. The final product couples polarized polycarbonate lenses with a durable, lightweight, BPA-free frame. We have received such great reviews from the samples that we want to take it to the public!
The Fusion frames are made from BPA free injection-polycarbonate plastics that are durable and super lightweight. Each model has a hazy finish that gives it a really cool hue.
Instead of screws, the arms of the Fusions are held in place by a ball and hole joint that fit snuggly together. This allows the user to mix and match their shades easily and efficiently on the go. Don't worry about having to buy 5 pairs of sunglasses to have variety. With just 2 pairs of fusions you have the ability to make 16 pairs!

The main concerns for us during the prototype phase were:
1. The strength of the joint
2. The durability of the joint
In the past, we have seen similar models that would easily fall apart if you were wearing them while enjoying active sports. This was not acceptable. We tested many prototypes to get to the point where we are confident that the strength of the hinge will not be a problem. 
AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE VIDEO, WE THREW THEM DOWN FORCEFULLY  WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE OR HAVING THE ARMS COME OFF THE FRAME! THE STRENGTH OF THE HINGE HAS BEEN TESTED MANY TIMES TO ADHERE TO OUR REQUIREMENTS.
The second concern was that the hinge wouldn't break when you interchanged the sides many times over. When we received the first samples they were not solid and after 50 tries they eventually broke. We went back to the manufacturer and told them the problem and we came up with a solution of a stronger polycarbonate plastic for the entire frame. There will be no stress fractures in these frames.


The frame is made from a durable, forgiving material that allows it to fit comfortably on your face while also avoiding stress fractures and other damage you see in cheaper frames. 
We are using a trusted, leading manufacturer of frames and lenses which are hand assembled, polished, and packaged to our exact specifications. But we need your help to go from working prototype to full scale production. Your pledge will go towards production and high-strength steel moulds necessary for the factory to turn out the quality we want on a larger scale. If the goal is met and barring any setbacks we expect to be shipping these out to you by August 2013!


As you can see in the picture below - the male and female pieces snap into place and fit snuggly. We didn't want them coming apart easily but also wanted to make it simple for you to mix and match. The Nectar logo is also raised up from the frame which gives it a nice feel.



The male piece consists of two half ball bearings that snap exactly into place with the female piece. The design is made to maximize effeinncey  and provide for the best possible durability in regards to the way that you bend or what actiivity you are doing.
Lenses on the Fusion model CAN be switched between the two frames - it's as simple as popping them out and snapping them back in!

Pod t-shirts<br/><br/><br/><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Q: How does the device get a location and communicate with the app?</b><br/>A: Pod uses GPS technology to locate your pet (like a car GPS which uses satellites to triangulate a location) so it has good coverage almost anywhere in the world. It then uses a SIM card with a mobile plan (all included) to send the location via a mobile network to the app and for the app to talk to the device to request locations.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the range of the unit?</b><br/>A:
Because we use GPS and GSM mobile technology instead of Bluetooth, the device talks to satellites and base stations then back to your mobile (not directly from the device to your mobile), so the question is more about coverage than range. GPS coverage is strong almost anywhere in the world and GSM is good in most regions, so you can track your animal even if it is in a different state or country!<br/></p>
<p><b>Q: What countries does Pod work in?</b><br/>A: We have a global Telco deal with Vodafone, so the unit can work in most countries which have Vodafone or their partners across the US (AT&amp;T, T-Mobile &amp; Sprint), Europe and Asia. <br/></p>
<p><b>Q: How much is the mobile cost?</b><br/>A: The first 12 months of mobile data and SMS fees are included with the unit and the renewal will be around $30 per year for most countries.</p>
<p><b>Q: How long is the battery life?</b><br/>A: We've developed a custom Lithium Polymer battery specifically for Pod which is long life and super small. The battery will last up to a week depending on usage.</p>
<p><b>Q: How do I charge the batteries?</b><br/>A: The unit comes with 2 x interchangeable batteries so you can charge one while using the other. You also get a charging dock which is a small unit that plugs into any USB port on your computer and the battery clicks in to charge within a couple of hours.</p>
<p><b>Q: How often are the location updates?</b><br/>A: You can request a current location at any time from the app and you can also put the unit to track mode, so it will continue to track locations on a journey. You can configure track mode to be in low, med or high frequency so it can get locations up to every 10 seconds in cases where your pet is missing. </p>
<p><b>Q: How big is the unit?</b><br/>A: Pod is slightly larger than a standard wine cork and weighs only 29 grams / 1.02 ounces. The dimensions are 50.5mm / 1.98 inches long by 23mm / 0.9 inches diameter.</p>
<p><b>Q: Which devices will the app run on?</b><br/>A: The Pod app will run on Apple iOS version 6 &amp; above and Android version 4.3 &amp; above (4.1 and 4.2 will run the app, but do not support Bluetooth Low Engery). A Windows Phone version will also be available soon.<br/></p>

Q: What countries does Pod work in?A: We have a global Telco deal with Vodafone, so the unit can work in most countries which have Vodafone or their partners across the US (AT&T, T-Mobile & Sprint), Europe and Asia. 
Q: How much is the mobile cost?A: The first 12 months of mobile data and SMS fees are included with the unit and the renewal will be around $30 per year for most countries.
Q: How long is the battery life?A: We've developed a custom Lithium Polymer battery specifically for Pod which is long life and super small. The battery will last up to a week depending on usage.
Q: How do I charge the batteries?A: The unit comes with 2 x interchangeable batteries so you can charge one while using the other. You also get a charging dock which is a small unit that plugs into any USB port on your computer and the battery clicks in to charge within a couple of hours.
Q: How often are the location updates?A: You can request a current location at any time from the app and you can also put the unit to track mode, so it will continue to track locations on a journey. You can configure track mode to be in low, med or high frequency so it can get locations up to every 10 seconds in cases where your pet is missing. 
Q: How big is the unit?A: Pod is slightly larger than a standard wine cork and weighs only 29 grams / 1.02 ounces. The dimensions are 50.5mm / 1.98 inches long by 23mm / 0.9 inches diameter.
Q: Which devices will the app run on?A: The Pod app will run on Apple iOS version 6 & above and Android version 4.3 & above (4.1 and 4.2 will run the app, but do not support Bluetooth Low Engery). A Windows Phone version will also be available soon.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Initially, there was no grand objective or vision. It began through discussion amongst friends about how branded shoe companies take advantage of people through cheap and dangerous manufacturing and selling at exorbitant prices.    </strong></p>
<p><strong>Have you ever been disappointed by the quality of shoes you’ve purchased for several hundred dollars whose only remaining “redeeming feature” was a luxury brand name?   </strong></p>
<p><strong>Have you ever suffered from red rash, or itchy and swollen toes due to toxic chemical substances and cheap synthetic materials?    </strong></p>
<p><strong>Have you ever felt guilty about labor exploitation and environmental degradation by picking up the cheap shoes ?    </strong></p>
<p><strong>Have you ever wondered why sustainable products are as expensive as premium brands, look  unappealing, and  whose quality suffers in the name of sustainability?    </strong></p>
<p><strong>We have.   </strong></p>
<p><strong>So, with more than 30 years of experience in the footwear industry, we’ve decided to develop our own shoes, which are comfortable, stylish, skin-friendly, and sustainable, offering true good quality shoes for men, women and children at an affordable price while tackling the perpetual problems of the fast fashion and footwear industries.</strong></p>

Have you ever felt guilty about labor exploitation and environmental degradation by picking up the cheap shoes ?    
Have you ever wondered why sustainable products are as expensive as premium brands, look  unappealing, and  whose quality suffers in the name of sustainability?    
We have.   
So, with more than 30 years of experience in the footwear industry, we’ve decided to develop our own shoes, which are comfortable, stylish, skin-friendly, and sustainable, offering true good quality shoes for men, women and children at an affordable price while tackling the perpetual problems of the fast fashion and footwear industries.
 

 
Finest and Sustainable Materials
Nature on the feet!

 
We care what material goes on your feet. Each element of Camfreys’ shoes is skin friendly and sustainable through our careful selection of the finest materials around the world. Unlike other brands, we use chromium free biodegradable leather, 70% recycled eco rubber sole, natural latex, natural cotton, natural cork, natural wool fiber, and water based glue for the entire shoemaking process.
 

 
 
Delving into the city of Porto, Portugal, 
you will discover the colors of our first collection.
 

 
Inspired by the glittering Douro River, the sweet and soft colors of Miragaia, the color changes of aging  of Vinho do Porto, the stretches of terracotta roofs, the beautiful buildings adorned with white glazed ceramic tiles, and the deep blue Atlantic Ocean are our major inspirational color sources which permeate every corner of Porto.
 

 
 


 

 
Exceptional Quality 
 
At Camfreys, we fabricate exceptional quality leather sneakers with passion and meticulous care through the experienced hands of a small workshop found in an amiable and safe working environment.  
Our supplier is a family owned artisanal factory. It has over 60 years of experience in handcrafting the highest quality leather shoes for men, women and children since its foundation in Sao Joao da Madeira, Portugal, a renowned city for making luxury leather shoes and goods for European luxury brands.
 

 
Fair wages & Safe Working environment
  
Our mission is to make the highest quality footwear while providing fair remuneration and a high standard working environment for our craftsmen.  
 

 
Extra Care
   
We believe that protecting our craftsmen from risks is as important as the material that goes on your feet. We use materials free of harmful substances to protect our workers involved in the manufacturing of Camfreys’ footwear.
 


 
 

 
 

 
 

 
PROJECT TIMELINE
 

ABOUT

 
Camfreys is an ethical and sustainable lifestyle footwear brand for men and women who appreciate not only comfort and alluring style but every step involved in the shoemaking business – from the material selection, the superb crafting of quality shoes, to the maintenance of high standard working conditions, all while minimizing environmental impact.    
The brand was founded in response to the perpetual problems found in the fashion and footwear industries which include the heavy reliance on unsustainable and harmful materials - to reduce the production cost, wasteful mass production, and labor exploitation under sweatshop conditions.    
At Camfreys, we offer a wide range of ethically made footwear that is skin-friendly, eco-friendly and community-friendly at an accessible price combining luxurious sophistication and ethical consciousness.     
Our objective is to make the highest quality lifestyle shoes, as we rise to the challenge of making zero plastic footwear.
 

 
RISK & CHALLENGES
Even though we have extensive experience in the shoemaking business, there are still unforeseeable risks and challenges, and it is our job to minimize those unpredictable risks and challenges.",16.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>Rebound is as important as shock absorption. Without rebound after a step, it would feel like walking in the sand - exhausting. Rebound return energy to the step and makes the walk more dynamic. Only cutting-edge foam offers both great absorption and rebound. The secret is to combine high-density, resilience, and elasticity, while remaining very soft.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why is Maratown™ the world's most comfortable shoes?</p>
<p>After testing dozens of dress shoes in a laboratory, we know that our shoe results have been far better than most. We succeeded in creating a sole that utilizes the cutting edge running shoe technology and uses a super soft sole, that is twice softer than the softest existing dress shoes currently available. We have also increased the thickness for more cushioning and are using a high density EVA material for durable absorption and rebound. Below, we have also added to the Maratown™, a well-known Vibram®­ outsole for high durability of the wear. The Maratown™'s sole is also very light-weight.</p>
<p>Then, we assembled it all in Western Europe - Portugal to be exact- with a high-quality leather upper. According to the advice of foot specialists, we have implemented features such a removable insole, padding collar, soft leather upper, and smooth inside.</p>
<p>In the end, the Maratown™ shoes offer a dressy style with the comfort of a sport shoe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why so much cushion?</p>
<p>Cushion is the most important factor in maintaining the comfort of the shoes. There is no brand that currently offers as much cushion as these shoes, while running shoes technology offers this cushion. So, we succeeded in assembling a leather upper with a running sole camouflaged in a dress shoe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Is the insole removable?</p>
<p>Yes, even though our insole is already cushioned with an EVA part and a leather upper, it is removable to allow for you to insert your personal orthopedic insole or a wearable electronic insole (count your daily step, warm, recharge…), or to clean up them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How light they are?</p>
<p>Maratown™ women wedge: 7.2Oz (205g) (size US 7, EU 39, insole included)</p>
<p>Maratown™ women boootie: 9.9Oz (280g) (size US 7, EU 39, insole included)</p>
<p>Maratown™ men derby: 11.7 Oz = 330g (size US 7, EU 42, laces and insole included)</p>
<p>Usual classic dress shoes: from 14 Oz to 1Lb 5Oz (400g to 600g)</p>
<p>Usual sport shoes: from 9Oz to 14Oz (250g to 400g)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How durable are the shoes?</p>
<p>Maratown™ is also made for durability. This was achieved mainly thanks to the Vibram® outsole.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For better life expectancy, please follow these essentials shoe care tips:</p>
<p>-Don't wear the shoes every day - alternate with another pair to let the shoe dry off. Let dry naturally.</p>
<p>-Leather upper: polish with high quality product.</p>
<p>-Sole: keep clean with a damp sponge or a brush.</p>
<p>-Use shoe tree.</p>
<p>-Un-tie before putting on or taking off.</p>

Rebound is as important as shock absorption. Without rebound after a step, it would feel like walking in the sand - exhausting. Rebound return energy to the step and makes the walk more dynamic. Only cutting-edge foam offers both great absorption and rebound. The secret is to combine high-density, resilience, and elasticity, while remaining very soft.

 
FEEL LIGHT
How often do you feel happy to remove your heavy dress shoes ? Maratown are 20% lighter in average.

DROP
The heel is 0.45 in higher than the forefront, to spread pressure throughout the foot.
 
PADDED COLLAR AND TONGUE
Maratown provide padding and cushioning at all pressure points, not only in the sole.
 
BENDING
Despite the thickness of the sole, the use of soft materials and a thinner front allows the shoe to the bend at the right point: at the base of the big toe where your feet articulate.

Maratown provide padding and cushioning at all pressure points, not only in the sole.
 
SOFT & PREMIUM LEATHER
No more stiff leather that hurts, even after breaking it in.
 
DURABILITY
While you might understandably think that using soft material could cause on a short lifespan, the durability of MARATOWN is at least as long as normal shoe, thanks to :-a 3 mm rubber outsole-the high density and resiliency of our soft, non-flattening foam.
 

REMOVABLE INSOLE
Are you using customized orthopedic insoles? In addition to offering the opportunity to remove the insole, you will keep 90% of the cushioning property in the middle sole, as opposed to traditional shoes where very little cushion is in the insole.

Why is Maratown™ the world's most comfortable shoes?
After testing dozens of dress shoes in a laboratory, we know that our shoe results have been far better than most. We succeeded in creating a sole that utilizes the cutting edge running shoe technology and uses a super soft sole, that is twice softer than the softest existing dress shoes currently available. We have also increased the thickness for more cushioning and are using a high density EVA material for durable absorption and rebound. Below, we have also added to the Maratown™, a well-known Vibram®­ outsole for high durability of the wear. The Maratown™'s sole is also very light-weight.
Then, we assembled it all in Western Europe - Portugal to be exact- with a high-quality leather upper. According to the advice of foot specialists, we have implemented features such a removable insole, padding collar, soft leather upper, and smooth inside.
In the end, the Maratown™ shoes offer a dressy style with the comfort of a sport shoe.
 
Why so much cushion?
Cushion is the most important factor in maintaining the comfort of the shoes. There is no brand that currently offers as much cushion as these shoes, while running shoes technology offers this cushion. So, we succeeded in assembling a leather upper with a running sole camouflaged in a dress shoe.
 
Is the insole removable?
Yes, even though our insole is already cushioned with an EVA part and a leather upper, it is removable to allow for you to insert your personal orthopedic insole or a wearable electronic insole (count your daily step, warm, recharge…), or to clean up them.
 
How light they are?
Maratown™ women wedge: 7.2Oz (205g) (size US 7, EU 39, insole included)
Maratown™ women boootie: 9.9Oz (280g) (size US 7, EU 39, insole included)
Maratown™ men derby: 11.7 Oz = 330g (size US 7, EU 42, laces and insole included)
Usual classic dress shoes: from 14 Oz to 1Lb 5Oz (400g to 600g)
Usual sport shoes: from 9Oz to 14Oz (250g to 400g)
 
How durable are the shoes?
Maratown™ is also made for durability. This was achieved mainly thanks to the Vibram® outsole.
 
For better life expectancy, please follow these essentials shoe care tips:
-Don't wear the shoes every day - alternate with another pair to let the shoe dry off. Let dry naturally.
-Leather upper: polish with high quality product.
-Sole: keep clean with a damp sponge or a brush.
-Use shoe tree.
-Un-tie before putting on or taking off.

<p>I am Max, 23 years old, studying and living in Vienna. As a student you 
are bound to attend some lectures, which do not necessarily grab your 
attention. Quite frankly, students then need something else to do. This 
is how I stumbled upon Kickstarter and the truly amazing ideas people

<p>One day, not too long ago, I noticed the sheer size and weight of my 
wallet. I have also talked to friends who told me that they feel the 
same. Everyone wanted something new. Everyone wanted something simple 
and practical.</p>
<p>
My dad is an engineer. I was working in his metal factory from a young 
age. One day at work I found an old credit card holder lying around. 
This simple item immediately created ideas in my head. After jotting 
some of them down I then applied my skills in working with metals to 
actually plan a first prototype. 
</p>
<p>Through the resources at my disposal, it was easy for me to produce 
the Wallum to the highest standards of quality possible, while keeping 
the price low.

</span><h1><span class=""notranlsate""><h4><b>WHAT IS WALLUM?</b></h4></span></h1>
<span class=""notranlsate"">
<p>The origin of the name is quite simple: WAL stands for wallet and LUM
 for aluminium, which is the raw material. It replaces the traditionally
 big wallet with a stylish design. It is as small as a credit card 
allows it to be for you to still fit your cards in it and it consists of
 2 aluminium plates held together tightly by 4 O-Rings. 
</p>
<p>As a result of this mechanism you can fit up to 15 cards of your 
choice into Wallum.  In the video you can see how easy it is to use. <br/></p>

I am Max, 23 years old, studying and living in Vienna. As a student you 
are bound to attend some lectures, which do not necessarily grab your 
attention. Quite frankly, students then need something else to do. This 
is how I stumbled upon Kickstarter and the truly amazing ideas people 
have to offer on it. It did not take many lectures until I thought: “Why
 not start a project myself?” 




HOW EVERYTHING STARTED?








One day, not too long ago, I noticed the sheer size and weight of my 
wallet. I have also talked to friends who told me that they feel the 
same. Everyone wanted something new. Everyone wanted something simple 
and practical.

My dad is an engineer. I was working in his metal factory from a young 
age. One day at work I found an old credit card holder lying around. 
This simple item immediately created ideas in my head. After jotting 
some of them down I then applied my skills in working with metals to 
actually plan a first prototype. 

Through the resources at my disposal, it was easy for me to produce 
the Wallum to the highest standards of quality possible, while keeping 
the price low.

WHAT IS WALLUM?

The origin of the name is quite simple: WAL stands for wallet and LUM
 for aluminium, which is the raw material. It replaces the traditionally
 big wallet with a stylish design. It is as small as a credit card 
allows it to be for you to still fit your cards in it and it consists of
 2 aluminium plates held together tightly by 4 O-Rings. 

As a result of this mechanism you can fit up to 15 cards of your 
choice into Wallum.  In the video you can see how easy it is to use. 


• Front Pocket Wallet: 

The initial reason was to create a wallet, which does not bulge your 
pocket due to its size. It also fits easily into the inside pocket of a 
suit jacket. Having your wallet in the front pocket does make it much 
harder for a pickpocket to reach it, giving it a safety aspect. Another 
reason was to reduce the size of a wallet for health reasons, 
eliminating the problems of back pain if you sit on your bulky wallet.

• NFC/RFID Protection: 

NFC is the technology enabling people to pay by touching the card 
reader with the debit or credit card. It was invented to make people’s 
life easier, but it leaves people with a potential security problem. 
Thieves could easily steal your data by touching your wallet with a 
special device. This NFC signal does not go through Wallum’s aluminium 
plates, leaving your data securely where it belongs. 

HOW IS WALLUM MANUFACTURED?

Wallum is manufactured directly in Austria and Germany. The first 
step is water jet cutting the form out of aluminium plates. After that 
CNC machines mill the details into each one of the wallets, e.g. the 
engraved designs, notches, etc. Thirdly the parts get sand blasted to 
leave it with a mat look. The last step is then anodising the plates in 
different colours and assembling the parts.
Here are the different combinations you can choose:

Choose from different engravings as well as different colours.
Contour Design:




Dimple Design:

X-Square Design:

Squares Design:

Star Design:

Colours you can choose:

Silver
Black
Blue
Red
Orange
Purple
Gold


The last step: choose between black or white rubber band and o-rings


HERE IS HOW YOU WILL KNOW WHAT COMBINATION OF COLOUR AND DESIGN YOU HAVE CHOSEN:

Once
 the project has been funded you will receive an email enquiring about 
your order details. We make a note of your choice of colour and 
engravings. 

When the project will be funded we can buy with the money more tools for the machines, all the raw materials like the aluminium, rubber bands, o-rings, material for sandblasting and anodization. When we got all these items we can start with the production of all your orders!

<p>névo is a stylish minimalist watch with activity tracking, smartphone notifications and Swiss movement. Now you can live a healthy, active lifestyle and look good doing it!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Making the decision to embed the latest technology into a watch was easy. We already love watches and wear them every day.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we created névo, a new class of wearable; a minimalist watch with smart notifications and the latest fitness technology built in. A product of clean lines and simple beauty that makes wearables personal.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1030720/files/20141119175503-activity_tracking.jpg?1416448503"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>

<h3><b>Swiss Timekeeping</b></h3>
<p>A watch is first and foremost timekeeper. We wanted the best in accuracy and reliability for névo so we built it around a Swiss movement from ETA, one of the most respected suppliers in the watch industry.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1052459/files/20141127185817-NO_CHARGING1.jpg?1417143497"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><b><br/></b></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><b>No Charging, ever</b></h3>
<p>Our approach to the user experience is different too. We know that no one wants the hassle of remembering to charge a watch every day so we made one that didn't need it.  Unlike other smartwatches and activity trackers, névo is powered by dual watch batteries and <i>never requires charging.</i></p>
<p>The first battery powers the Swiss timekeeping movement for 5 years or more. The second battery powers the névo smart features of  and lasts up to 6 months. Both batteries are inexpensive and easy to change.</p>
<p>If changing batteries isn't your thing, we have another option for you...</p>

<h3>nevo solar</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are proud to announce a new model: névo solar - the world’s first solar powered connected watch.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking innovation utilizes Sunpartner Technologies Wysisps invisible photovoltaic solution embedded in the watch dial and connected to an on-board rechargeable battery. The system is optimized for indoor lighting and eliminates the need for direct sunlight. The highly efficient Wysips® system powers all névo smart features including activity tracking, goal progression, alarms and smart notifications. </p>
<p>When we developed névo we made battery life a top priority. Our standard dual battery system and low-consumption technology frees users from the inconvenience of nightly charging and now we take that concept to its ultimate conclusion – solar power. With névo solar we capture the unlimited power of light. Choose névo solar and say goodbye to battery issues forever. *</p>
<p><b>This new feature will be made available as a new model – névo solar, and will ship in August of 2015.</b><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Battery Replacement Tool</h3>
<div>You asked and we listened. The battery replacement tool was the most requested stretch goal and we reached it in a hurry. We have already created the prototype tool and it works great. Now battery changes are safe and easy. The tool will be included with all névo watches at no extra charge. See more images in the gallery.</div>

 activity tracking - phone notifications - Swiss timekeeping - style

We've gone In Demand!

Our pre-sale campaign is now over but we have gone In Demand on Indiegogo. You can still buy névo and névo solar using the perk system. Contact us for any details or questions

névo is a stylish minimalist watch with activity tracking, smartphone notifications and Swiss movement. Now you can live a healthy, active lifestyle and look good doing it!

Making the decision to embed the latest technology into a watch was easy. We already love watches and wear them every day.
With that in mind, we created névo, a new class of wearable; a minimalist watch with smart notifications and the latest fitness technology built in. A product of clean lines and simple beauty that makes wearables personal.




Track steps, runs, swimsBut névo isn't just a pretty face. We packed it with the tools to help you look better and feel better. Small changes in daily activity and habits can have a profound positive impact on weight loss and your health.  In fact, studies show that people who use step counting devices increase their physical activity by 26.9 percent over baseline.Managing your daily activity with névo is easy and fun. You simply set a daily goal with the included app and névo does the rest.Goal progression at a glanceTo manage something, it must be measured and we wanted a simple and quick way to show  your daily progress so we embedded eleven bright white LED indicators around the névo dial. Just a touch of the button and you will know instantly how close you are to achieving your daily goal.This instant feedback raises awareness of your  activity level and motivates you toward healthy daily habits.Phone NotificationsEveryone likes to stay connected. So we built Bluetooth connectivity into névo. It alerts you when you receive an important call or text. 
Use the névo silent vibrating alarm to set a daily notification for waking up or important reminders anytime.



We added six single color LEDs alongside the white LEDs . The color LEDs are optional to enable and can be used to indicate different types of phone alerts, in addition to the  vibration. 
Now you will be able to customize alert settings of different types or for alerts from Favorites.The colors above are approximate (we are still finalizing) but the positions are correct. 






Swiss Timekeeping
A watch is first and foremost timekeeper. We wanted the best in accuracy and reliability for névo so we built it around a Swiss movement from ETA, one of the most respected suppliers in the watch industry.





No Charging, ever
Our approach to the user experience is different too. We know that no one wants the hassle of remembering to charge a watch every day so we made one that didn't need it.  Unlike other smartwatches and activity trackers, névo is powered by dual watch batteries and never requires charging.
The first battery powers the Swiss timekeeping movement for 5 years or more. The second battery powers the névo smart features of  and lasts up to 6 months. Both batteries are inexpensive and easy to change.
If changing batteries isn't your thing, we have another option for you...






nevo solar

We are proud to announce a new model: névo solar - the world’s first solar powered connected watch.
This groundbreaking innovation utilizes Sunpartner Technologies Wysisps invisible photovoltaic solution embedded in the watch dial and connected to an on-board rechargeable battery. The system is optimized for indoor lighting and eliminates the need for direct sunlight. The highly efficient Wysips® system powers all névo smart features including activity tracking, goal progression, alarms and smart notifications. 
When we developed névo we made battery life a top priority. Our standard dual battery system and low-consumption technology frees users from the inconvenience of nightly charging and now we take that concept to its ultimate conclusion – solar power. With névo solar we capture the unlimited power of light. Choose névo solar and say goodbye to battery issues forever. *
This new feature will be made available as a new model – névo solar, and will ship in August of 2015.





Battery Replacement Tool
You asked and we listened. The battery replacement tool was the most requested stretch goal and we reached it in a hurry. We have already created the prototype tool and it works great. Now battery changes are safe and easy. The tool will be included with all névo watches at no extra charge. See more images in the gallery.
* nevo solar powers the features battery. The battery for the Swiss movement is not rechargeable and has an expected life of 5+ years.


Personal Style
As you can see, style is extremely important to us. To begin with, the following névo models will be available:
*** UPDATE*** We will survey all contributors at the end of the campaign and you can select model and size.

		The Paris is our nod to the timeless classics of history. Like the city of lights itself, this watch is an elegant accessory for any occasion.

Customize

You are unique, and so is névo. The watch comes with two straps that are easily interchangeable with a modern quick-release design. One strap is Italian leather, a look that is appropriate for any outfit or occasion and the other is a durable and comfortable fabric, perfect for runners and swimmers.

Attention to detail from product to package...









Design for Life
Design sensibility is a cornerstone for our company. To us, form cannot be sacrificed for function. névo’s simple lines and organic shape is designed to be worn every day and for any occasion. 

Taking a minimalist, 'less is more' approach, our designer created a watch that is useful, beautiful and unique. It is a timepiece  that acknowledges the past while looking toward the future.




The Watch














The App
névo uses sophisticated
	accelerometers and powerful algorithms to track your daily activities but the
	interface is simple. You set a daily goal using the app and then simply wear névo.




Set goals, follow your progress over time, and see results. Our app is simple and intuitive. You set a daily goal for steps, running, swimming, calories burned or distance. 
Whether you are commuting to the office or going to the gym, you can leave your phone behind. névo can remember your data for up to a week. When in range, névo can sync to your phone and the cloud using Bluetooth 4.0.
View your history and progress on your phone or on the web anytime.

INTRODUCTION
Welcome! 
First of all I would like to thank you all for visiting this page and taking the time to know more about this project. 
I´m a graphic and fashion designer living in Berlin where I plan to develop my project. I have worked as a freelance graphic designer for 10 years now and I think it´s time to make a big step in my career, so since last year I´ve been working intensivly analising the idea of creating a clothing brand to provide a very good quiality product, with the plus of original design and artistic sensibility. So came the concept for this brand, SAY IT.
 
PROJECT
The objective is to create a new cool and fresh way to express trough the clothing you wear. A new brand with an original taste, modern, abstract, simple but powerfull. A mix of passions and techniques, combined to create clothing with a feel of individuality and freedom. 
 
COLLECTION
The fisrt Collection is inspired on a research about geometry as a simple abstract form of beauty. Morfology, proportion, texture and volume are combined to create this designs and to express individuality, intesrests and tastes.  
Here you can check some illustrative previews from this collection:









 
RESPONSIBILITY
Our providers are members of the Fair wear Foundation. Our clothing is also Oeko-Tex 100 Standard certified.
 
FUNDING
I will need your support to reach my $3.500 goal, in order to produce the upcoming first collection in the next months.
By supporting this project you will help SAY IT become REAL, by helping me raise funds for the following things:
 
1 - Production:
- Screenprinting and labeling of all the items, including t-shirts, tops, sweatshirts and bags.
2 - Marqueting: 
- Printing of marketing material like visiting cards, flyers, stickers, cataloges posters, hang tags and labels.
3 - Selling:
- Renting spaces and stands in design markets and shops to show and sell the first collection of SAT IT.
4 - Rewards and shipping:
- Materials, screen printing, packaging, and shipping costs to send you all some items from the collection.
5 - Indiegogo and other fees: up to +14%
 
* If raised funds don´t reach my goal:
Any amount will help me as a first kick to make this first collection real :)
 
* If raised funds exceed my goal:
This would help me not only to fund the development of this collection, but also allowing me to contract a programer for the Web Page and Online Store, wich must be professionally programed for usability, functionality and security issues.
I will also need funds for contracting models and a professional photographer for the catalog and the campaign. Also for Buying publicity spaces in local magazinnes.
Extra funds would also help SAY IT to grow, by expanding the collection with more designs, and inlcluding a line of t-shirts for kids too!
Therefore, all extra funds would be really welcome to help SAY IT to grow and expand its market.
 
REWARDS
SAY IT will thank your support witn some great rewards !!! So if you like this collection you can preorder now the products you want from the pledge levels on the right.
As a reward for your donation you can get T´shirts, tops, bags, pins, postcards, posters, stickers and also products for our next collections.
Note: You will have the opportunity to select your shirt(s) size and design from the catalog before we ship your reward. The final catalog will be limitated if this campaign doesn´t reach its goal.

<p><i>Carry your cash in style</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In order to offer a new way to carry your bills, we had to change what we used. The money clip has a clear advantage as it doesn't need a pocket, making the wallet a whole lot thinner. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong style=""text-align: center;width:60%;"">What we did better: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">By rounding the inner edge of the clip, we made sure that you can take out your cash without ever opening your wallet.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">The money clip sits firmly against a dip in the middle of the wallet so it'll always return to the same secure position.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Comfortable Capacity: 10 bills</strong> (max: 20 bills)</p>

<p><i>Easy access to your cards</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Using slots on either side to slide out your cards, the design gives a quick and easy way to access your less used cards.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>What we did better:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">The thumb shaped cutouts make it easy to remove any card, even when your wallet is closed. </li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">The slight stagger in the cards, which allows the top card to slide over the bottom, makes for a quick removal.</li>

<p><strong>I'm Sam, the founder of Slim. </strong></p>
<p>I'm a designer at heart and after many years of crafting and testing many prototypes, we've finally perfected the bifold wallet.</p>
<p>Coming in at a mere one-centimetre thin (<i>empty &amp; full</i>), we've created the world's thinnest leather wallet which incorporates world-class leather with a heavily-prototyped design. </p>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Too many wallets are either small pouches where you have to fold notes or overly bulky traditional wallets where everything gets lost inside them.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong> The Slide lets you get to your items as fast as possible. You can draw bills, pick the exact card and take out coins without ever having to open it.</p>
</div></div>","Carry your cash in style
 
In order to offer a new way to carry your bills, we had to change what we used. The money clip has a clear advantage as it doesn't need a pocket, making the wallet a whole lot thinner. 
What we did better: 

By rounding the inner edge of the clip, we made sure that you can take out your cash without ever opening your wallet.
The money clip sits firmly against a dip in the middle of the wallet so it'll always return to the same secure position.

Comfortable Capacity: 10 bills (max: 20 bills)
 

 
 

 

 

Easy access to your cards
 
Using slots on either side to slide out your cards, the design gives a quick and easy way to access your less used cards.
What we did better:

The thumb shaped cutouts make it easy to remove any card, even when your wallet is closed. 
The slight stagger in the cards, which allows the top card to slide over the bottom, makes for a quick removal.

Comfortable Capacity: 4 cards (max: 5 cards)
 

 
 

 

 

A non-RFID pull tab for quick access
 
This pocket is not RFID protected to allow you to slide right through RFID scanners at work, on the tube or even at the supermarket.
What we did better:

The two embossed lines on the front of the wallet let you put your card in without having to look for the pocket opening. 
The pull tab is outside the pocket to allow for smooth, uninterrupted access to your most used cards and identification.

Comfortable Capacity: 2 cards (max: 5 cards)
 

 
 

 

 

Carry your coins securely
 
A coin pocket is needed in any wallet, so we made it as simple as possible without it affecting the size or functionality, even if you don't plan to use it.
What we did better:

Using the simple extra flap to ensure nothing falls out, we made sure you can carry your coins securely. 
The pocket can store just about anything without it ever falling out. a note, receipt, a SIM card, the list is endless.. All in a slim form.

Comfortable Capacity: 5 coins (max: 10 coins)
 

 
 
 

 

 

 
The wallet comes in at a super slim 10mm which barely increases when it's loaded to a comfortable capacity of 10 cards, 10 bills and 5 coins.
It can take anywhere up to 15 cards, 20 bills and 10 coins - the maximum capacity - so you can carry everything you want.

<p><b>What is Smart Parka?</b></p>
<p>We believe that going out in winter should not be intimidating. It should be fun. We found a real problem with winter coats. If the weather turns bad, and you don't have your gloves or anything to cover your face, you are not protected. </p>
<p>Smart Parka is the first winter coat ever with built in gloves, a built in scarf, a removable lining for extra cold days and an extension to turn your hip-length parka into a mid-length coat. </p>

</div>","Special Pre-order Price: $295 (retail value $740 USD +taxes) 
Sure, winter might be over, but will you be ready when it comes around again? 
Manufacturing has begun on our one-of-a-kind Smart Parka and we're giving you the chance to pre-order at a special price before it goes to retail.
Order today and get yours for only $295.

What is Smart Parka?
We believe that going out in winter should not be intimidating. It should be fun. We found a real problem with winter coats. If the weather turns bad, and you don't have your gloves or anything to cover your face, you are not protected. 
Smart Parka is the first winter coat ever with built in gloves, a built in scarf, a removable lining for extra cold days and an extension to turn your hip-length parka into a mid-length coat. 





How much does it cost?
We think it's just fair that we reward those who help us make it happen. 






What styles do these coats come in?
Smart Parka comes in 4 different styles for women and 3 different styles for men. We have something to fit every personality. 












Take a look at Smart Parka styles
Check out each of our styles for men and women and the colors available. 











 























Some Great Features of SMART PARKA


Super soft yet water resistant leather gloves with the thinnest and warmest insulation. Designed specifically for Smart Parka, the gloves tuck neatly inside the zippered pockets in the coat's sleeves.





 Built-in scarf to cover you up when the wind suddenly starts to howl.






Tablet pocket designed to comfortably fit an iPad, can hold onto most tablets, clutch, notebook etc.






Glasses pocket to keep your reading glasses, sunglasses, or ski goggles safe and handy.






Coat extension gives you extra length for particularly cold days or a winter night out in a nice dress. 





Removable interior layer makes the coat adaptable to different temperatures, so you can be comfortable every day of the winter season. Duplicate pockets on each layer means that the coat's functionality is never compromised.






Phone Pocket keeps your phone safely close at hand while supporting your headphones to offer a seamless connection.






Hat pocket lets you stash your toque (as we call them in Canada), belaclava, ski hat, cossack, trapper, etc.






Tracker tag pocket inside the coat fits most commercial tracker tags so that you can locate your coat if you've left it somewhere or when you're scrambling to get out the door.







Water resistant exterior protects you from the wetter elements and drivers who can't be bothered to slow down for puddles. 






OTHER FEATURES
Hand warming fleece pockets for extra comfort.
Heavy-duty, YKK® zipper
Fill : White Duck Down (inner lining), Synthetic Insulation (outer and gloves)
Fur : Faux fur
IMPORTANT: All features are available in all the models with the two exceptions
a. There is no extension for the Bomber (Men and Women)b. There is no removable lining for the Vogue (Women)
The Bomber's design excludes an extension and the Vogue (Women) has an integrated inner layer already.
ULTIMATE QUALITY MATERIALS:
Coats made for serious weather need serious materials. We've chosen the sturdiest hardware and fabrics with the ideal balance between luxurious feel and durability.







We reached our first stretch goal of $500k so every backer gets our ""Backer Only Edition"" T-shirt with their coat, absolutely free!






















If you do not absolutely love your coat, just return it within two weeks and get a full refund of your pledge minus shipping and handling. No questions asked.    EXCHANGE POLICY:
We are happy to exchange your coat for any reason. Just return your Smart Parka plus the shipping fee and we will send you another one right away.

<p>We’ve all been there. Sitting on a beautiful beach, waves lapping at the shore, cool water beckoning relief from the blazing sun. You look at the water, you look at your stuff, you look at the water again. What about the stuff? Option A: You cover it with your towel. Option B: You keep an eye on it while you’re swimming don’t look like great options. Spoiler alert: We all know how this will end..</p>
<p> Fortunately, there’s Blocke Beach: a simple box that will allow you to dive into the water without worrying about someone running off with your valuables. Keep your important things such as hotel keys, smartphone, money, and other valuables while out in the water. Just screw the box in the sand using the anchor sand for the umbrella. Put your belongings inside and lock the box. It’s really that easy.</p>

<p>We are a small family business that had an idea, and began the great challenge of making it real. </p>
<p>We got the patent, and spend our savings in prototyping, and testing, to deliver a great product. </p>
<p>We are commited to make this project a reality.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a company we are involved in the security business for more than 10 years and we developed and patented two more products. </p>
<p>People of our team have a background of more than 20 years in locks and security and moves to our company because: Security can be done at a good price</p>
<p>Our main feature is that we put in place of user when developing a product and not launched it until not meet the highest quality and safety requirements</p>

<p></p>
<p>•<span>  </span>This is the first thought of the
people, but rest assured, the box is bolted to the floor. If someone pulls the
umbrella umbrella but the box would still be bolted to the floor. A picture is
worth a thousand words.</p>

<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><b><b>Is it really safe?</b></b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>• Blocke
Beach is as safe as you want it to be. Pace it
securely fastened to the sand with the anchor of the umbrella, and use a good lock. Check out the installation picture below
to see how secure it can be.</p>

<p></p>
<p>• <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">You can put the key into a bracelet in the same way as is done in pools and spas, or also you can put in your pocket bathing suit. We recommend using keyless locks, but never recommend using the typical combination lock used in the bags, since its opening is very easy.</span></p>
<p>We will offer two solutions we believe are the most appropriate and therefore the safest:</p>
<p>- Lock keyless opening movement: In this padlock combinations of numbers are eliminated and only remember the sequence of moves. Please see this video that we found in youtube for a better understanding (it is not ours)</p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dxsc0LWCm7E"" width=""560""></iframe></div>
<p>- Alarm Lock: In this case, despite having key, se3 compensates the product with the alarm. That way if someone approaches your box with the intention of opening Buzzer will sound and let you know. Please see this video that we found in youtube for a better understanding  (it is not ours)</p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/W3EibI1edn0"" width=""560""></iframe></div>

PLEASE  CHECK THE LASTEST UPDATE (13th of June)
SEND US AN EMAIL WITH YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND YOU WILL GET 5$ OFF  (info@cajaplaya.com)
Blocke Beach will keep your, smartphone, money, and other valuables safe while out in the water.
Just screw the box in the sand using the anchor sand for the umbrella, put your
belongings inside and lock the box. The mechanism that confers Blocke Beach its
safety is based on a propietary screwing mechanism that anchors the box
strongly inside the sand. Optionally, safety can be enhanced thanks to a heavy
duty alarm padlock that produces a loud sound when the box is manipulated



We’ve all been there. Sitting on a beautiful beach, waves lapping at the shore, cool water beckoning relief from the blazing sun. You look at the water, you look at your stuff, you look at the water again. What about the stuff? Option A: You cover it with your towel. Option B: You keep an eye on it while you’re swimming don’t look like great options. Spoiler alert: We all know how this will end..
 Fortunately, there’s Blocke Beach: a simple box that will allow you to dive into the water without worrying about someone running off with your valuables. Keep your important things such as hotel keys, smartphone, money, and other valuables while out in the water. Just screw the box in the sand using the anchor sand for the umbrella. Put your belongings inside and lock the box. It’s really that easy.





The product is finished and has been tested. Our users are loving it so far!

The boxes
are ready to be shipped. We'll start processing orders the moment our campaign
funds become available, in the order they are received. You can expect your box
to arrive in June, just in time for your holidays!

We have
started this Indiegogo campaign to run a marketing campaign that will allow us
to reach out to many potential users.
We want to
make a marketing campaign on the media. The more money we raise, the longer
the campaign!



Please find bellow the chart for the rewards that we offer. Please find the one you preffer.
We would like to start the delivery of the rewards in the middle of June 





We are a small family business that had an idea, and began the great challenge of making it real. 
We got the patent, and spend our savings in prototyping, and testing, to deliver a great product. 
We are commited to make this project a reality.

As a company we are involved in the security business for more than 10 years and we developed and patented two more products. 
People of our team have a background of more than 20 years in locks and security and moves to our company because: Security can be done at a good price
Our main feature is that we put in place of user when developing a product and not launched it until not meet the highest quality and safety requirements






what does happen if we don't reach the goal?


Please note
that all the rewards will be served and delivered, since we have units in
stock. That means you will not need to wait to see if we reached the goal to
get your reward. Funds will cover a marketing campaign we plan to run during
the summer. The more we raise, the longer the campaign!
Would you like to customize your Blocke Beach?
• We offer the posibility to customize your blocke beach in the following ways:
- Customize your cover: You will be able to personalize your BB with the image of your family ( max 6 people), or maybe if you are a lot of people in your family yo put in the cover the name of your family. Just another way to make different and funny your security box.
- The other way to customize your Blocke Beach is protecting it with the padlocks that we offer. The keyless padlock and the alarm siren padlock. Two special options for a very special people. you can search the same product on the net and you will realize about the good offer. Please see the picture bellow.




What if I pull the umbrella and take it?

•  This is the first thought of the
people, but rest assured, the box is bolted to the floor. If someone pulls the
umbrella umbrella but the box would still be bolted to the floor. A picture is
worth a thousand words.



Is it really safe?

• Blocke
Beach is as safe as you want it to be. Pace it
securely fastened to the sand with the anchor of the umbrella, and use a good lock. Check out the installation picture below
to see how secure it can be.




What
do I do with the key?

• You can put the key into a bracelet in the same way as is done in pools and spas, or also you can put in your pocket bathing suit. We recommend using keyless locks, but never recommend using the typical combination lock used in the bags, since its opening is very easy.
We will offer two solutions we believe are the most appropriate and therefore the safest:
- Lock keyless opening movement: In this padlock combinations of numbers are eliminated and only remember the sequence of moves. Please see this video that we found in youtube for a better understanding (it is not ours)

- Alarm Lock: In this case, despite having key, se3 compensates the product with the alarm. That way if someone approaches your box with the intention of opening Buzzer will sound and let you know. Please see this video that we found in youtube for a better understanding  (it is not ours)

In our rewards can choose which one is the one you like

What are the measurements of the box?
• The box has very comfortable size, is portable and weighs less than 1kg. The measuremets are 270x160x90 mm and the container has a capacity of 1 liter



What material is made from?
• The box is made of plastic polypropylene of last generation that gives it great resistance to deformation






Use the Indiegogo
share tools and tell your friends and family about Blocke Beach!
Thank you very much for your support! Any
questions you may have, please drop us a line at info@cajaplaya.com.
We look forward to having you on board.

Somos una pequeña empresa familiar que un día tuvo una idea, y empezó el gran reto de ponerla en marcha. La patentamos, nos gastamos los ahorros en prototipos, pruebas, moldes... en fin, una odisea, que sólo la ilusión nos impedía dejarlo a la mitad. 

 ¿Que hemos inventado?, pues muy sencillo, la respuesta a la pregunta que nos hacemos todos cuando estamos en la playa y queremos bañarnos o dar un paseo:



¿Y donde pongo ahora mi smartphone para que no se estropee o no me lo quiten?



Vamos, quien dice smartphone, dice gafas de sol, llaves del coche, etc

Os dejamos un vídeo donde se explica para que sirve y como funciona. Mas abajo os resolverémos las dudas de si es seguro, si lo pueden abrir, etc...

La crisis sigue ahí y por eso os lo agradecemos mas todavía.



Qué pasará si no llegamos a los 3500€?





 Si no llegamos a la cifra, todos los apoyos recibidos serán invertidos de cualquier manera, en una campaña de medios, La única diferencia será que en vez de oírse el anuncio cuatro veces al día se oirá una vez nada mas.

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">About me</span><br/>
</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Jonathan. I am a 17 year old  high school junior from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  I have always had the passion for design and creation whether it was with Legos, K’nexs, or even cereal boxes. I have always had the desire to create and I've always had the desire create for others, but now I have the desire to <b>GIVE</b> to others.</p>
<p>Just about two years ago I had the idea that I wanted to start a tee shirt business. From there I went to my mom (who is a single mother, I’m her only son) about my amazing idea. My mom has always supported me in everything I wanted to do no matter the cause. My mom, being my number one supporter, seemed to become instantly dedicated to what I wanted to do, maybe even more than me. My mom had to sit through countless hours of me going on about how amazing my tee shirts were going to be. One thing that was holding me back was my lack of knowledge of design. I had no f drawing skills, so at that point my mom surprised me and decided to put me in Moore College of Art and Design's Youth Program.</p>
<p><b>Moore College of Art and Design</b> is where I spent two summers, and many fall and spring sessions. My mom worked as hard as she could to enroll me in the classes I wanted to take. Every session my mom would allow me to pick two classes from the ones she thought would help me the most. At Moore I started with basic drawing and worked my way up to Silk screening (Tee shirt Printing), graphic design, and Fashion/sewing. During this time the original concept of my business began to shift into something more interesting and endearing. <b>It went from a tee shirt business to the idea of a fashion brand.</b> I became so familiar with fashion and design that I wanted to broaden my idea. When I told my mom, she supported me with the same enthusiasm and confidence that I remember her having in me. </p>
<p>After I took every class at Moore that could help me in creating my business; it was time for me to begin learning other skills for creating my tee shirts. That's when I began to attend The Enterprise Center(Current Partner), and I began to learn how to start my own business. I learned everything I needed to create a successful business. In the last year <b>I've learned an exceedingly large amount of information about entrepreneurship. </b></p>
<p><b><b>Today </b>I am ready to bring  my brand to life. </b></p>

<p> </p></figure></div><h1>FAQS </h1><p><b>1. How much does each Origamei weigh? </b></p><p>Approximately 15oz, depending on style and size.</p><p><b>2. What is the material composition of the dress? Can it be machine washed and dried?</b></p><p>90% Polyester and 10% Elastane - Allowing each Origamei to be wrinkle resistant, 4-way stretchable, breathable, and lightweight. Each dress is also true to size and pre-shrunk! We've tested it with over 100 washes and dries.</p><p><b>3. What is the material composition of the key-ring? Can it be machine washed and dried? </b></p><p>The zinc alloy key-ring (carabiner) is spring-loaded, durable, and rust-proof allowing you ease of mind when washing and drying. We've tested it with over 100 washes and dries.</p><p><b>4. Can an Origamei be hemmed in length? </b></p><p>Since the foldable pocket feature is stitched at the lower bottom of the dress, the Origamei KIKU (Tent dress) and MOMO (T-shirt dress) cannot be hemmed. Although, with the inner lining nature of the YURI (Layered dress), it can be hemmed at the waistline where the lining and the original fabric meets.</p><p><b>5. Can the YURI (layered dress) be used for nursing (surprisingly common question)? </b></p><p>Unfortunately, the YURI dress was not designed with a nursing feature included. Although, we’re sure it could be self-modified into the lining fabric for those we would like a fun side project!</p><p><b>6.

 FAQS 1. How much does each Origamei weigh? Approximately 15oz, depending on style and size.2. What is the material composition of the dress? Can it be machine washed and dried?90% Polyester and 10% Elastane - Allowing each Origamei to be wrinkle resistant, 4-way stretchable, breathable, and lightweight. Each dress is also true to size and pre-shrunk! We've tested it with over 100 washes and dries.3. What is the material composition of the key-ring? Can it be machine washed and dried? The zinc alloy key-ring (carabiner) is spring-loaded, durable, and rust-proof allowing you ease of mind when washing and drying. We've tested it with over 100 washes and dries.4. Can an Origamei be hemmed in length? Since the foldable pocket feature is stitched at the lower bottom of the dress, the Origamei KIKU (Tent dress) and MOMO (T-shirt dress) cannot be hemmed. Although, with the inner lining nature of the YURI (Layered dress), it can be hemmed at the waistline where the lining and the original fabric meets.5. Can the YURI (layered dress) be used for nursing (surprisingly common question)? Unfortunately, the YURI dress was not designed with a nursing feature included. Although, we’re sure it could be self-modified into the lining fabric for those we would like a fun side project!6. What is your return and exchange policy?

<h3><strong>WHY isn't plastic the best idea for sports gear?</strong></h3>
<p>Almost 100% of sports gear available is made of pure plastic. Plastic means the fibres are fully synthetic, made of melted plastic granulate typically from crude oil and a wild mix of other chemicals. The most commonly known plastic fabrics are Polyester, Nylon (aka Polyamide), Polypropylene, or Elastan (aka Spandex).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565773890/b58t6nusxgopi9xe8kov.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>There are 3 major downsides of plastic textiles. First, MICROPLASTIC. Currently, our most pressing enemy.* It´s produced when you wash your running gear in the washing machine. Millions and millions of pounds are floating in our oceans. Synthetic textiles are one of the main polluters. Second, non-biodegradability. Plastic stays alive for centuries and does not dissolve easily. Third, toxicity. Scientists have highlighted the toxic impact of plastic in the ocean. Doesn't seem to be the smartest thing to wear on your sweaty body while working out right?!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565773930/jcdcqswcporlbvehll6k.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3><strong>Minimal Plastic - Minimal Footprint - Happy Running</strong></h3>
<p>It is out of question that we need alternatives. The current trend of using recycled plastic from the oceans cannot be the long term solution. New plastic shirt = new pollution. A great alternative for running gear needs to be functional, regenerative, and biodegradable. We studied fibres and fabrics in terms of performance and sustainability. For our 1st collection we are replacing plastic fibres with great natural and non-harmful chemical fibres: Merino wool and Tencel Lyocell.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565774030/nfwll77zmhfiopfttn2m.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Merino wool </strong>is the most functional natural fibre for active usage. It's fibres are very fine and super soft, it can perfectly deal with different temperatures and moisture. With its antimicrobial strengths, bad odor doesn't stick to it like cheap polyester fabrics.</p>
<p><strong>Tencel Lyocell</strong> fibre is a modern viscose that is wood based (eucalyptus, beech trees). It is produced by the Austrian manufacturer Lenzing. In some ways it performs similar to Merino wool, but 2 specific strengths are its softness and its cooling effect. Together, Merino and Tencel are an unbeatable team.</p> <h3><strong>Our 1st Collection</strong></h3>
<p>The collection consists of 4 pieces. The lightweight knitted shirt, the woven short, and the knitted tights in long and short. While the shirt and short are made with 100% non-plastic fibres, the tights still need a tiny touch of Elastan to be strong and flexible (less than 10%). </p>

<p>After coming home from your run you can simply put the gear on a hanger and hang it into the window. Let the air do the rest. It's Fast drying and the odor vanishes.

So you see, despite every optimism and detailed planning, things can happen. Whenever any time delay or anything else occurs, we guarantee you that you will be the first to know about this. In any case, you will get a regular update from us about the status of your products.

</div></div>","The refugee crisis has never been more real. Over 65 million people have been forced from their homes by war and violence. These innocent people are stuck in indefinite limbo, without the freedom to work, play and live free. It’s a miserable existence that crushes aspiration and traps talent. But what if one small object had the power to give back opportunity to those who have lost it? That is the objective of The Pin Project: to help displaced persons, returnees and refugees achieve long-term self-reliance through meaningful work. By buying or gifting a Pin made by a refugee, displaced person or returnee, you will help create employment and income for a displaced generation to craft their own futures.     Pin PricingWe are partners from around the world. Under Pricing we outline the approximate conversation rates for each reward you purchase.   The Pin measures 0.95 inches wide x 1.4 inches long (3.5 cm x 2.4 cm). The Pin weighs between 5.5 and 6 grams.This is how the Pin will be packaged: Wearing the Pin Iconic, fashion-forward and universal, the Pin can be worn anywhere, on anything, by anyone. It’s a badge of honor, signifying our shared commitment to meeting one of the greatest challenges of our time.  Inspired DesignThe Pin is designed by the award-winning jewelry designer Jenny Bird. The kite is a symbol of hope and aspiration. It represents the power of humanity’s ability to rise above challenges, no matter how great. Gifting a Pin this Holiday SeasonAs the season of giving and goodwill approaches, make a difference with your gifts this holiday season. After backing the campaign, we’ll send you a virtual card previewing the Pin and showing how it will make a difference, which you can then forward to the recipient(s) of your choosing.   Special EditionFor an extra special gift or keepsake, choose our elegant 18-Karat Solid Gold Pin. You can also choose a collection of all three Pins.   Special Edition: Afghan Kites In the countries where refugees and returnees will be producing The Pin, the kite represents hope to children and adults alike. By purchasing these authentic Afghan kites to fly or display on your wall, you'll also be supporting The Pin Project as we equip a Jordanian workshop to employ Syrian refugees. You can also pair The Brass Pin with a set of five kites.

Both the watch face and watch back is built with scratch resistant sapphire glass that also creates a fish eye effect giving the Automatic Vintage Lens an authentic camera look that you can't find anywhere else.Made with a skeleton design, the openworked dial gives you a view into the complex inner workings of the movement inside. This combined with a three layered dial gives you an elegant design that allows you to see the watch in action.Made with a skeleton design, the openworked dial gives you a view into the complex inner workings of the movement inside. This combined with a three layered dial gives you an elegant design that allows you to see the watch in action.The focus ring inspired Bezel gives our watch the feel of a real camera lens. This attention to detail gives the Automatic Vintage Lens an uncanny resemblance to a camera lens and is a testament to our dedication to craft.Instead of the boring standard numbered watch face for the minor indices, you are instead given the focal length and aperture numbers to indicate the time.Encased in a 47mm case inspired by camera bodies, the Automatic Vintage Lens doesn't use simple stainless steel. Instead, ours is gold plated with engraved serial numbers (limited availability) and model number inserts.Our movement is an automatic customized gold plated Miyota 82S0, beautifully tailored to fit inside the Automatic Vintage Lens. The power reserve will last a durable 40 hours and will run indefinitely as long as there is movement. With 21 Jewels, the Automatic Vintage Lens will also be one of the most accurate time pieces on the market.With genuine leather straps manufactured by Horween in Chicago, the same company that makes basketballs for the NBA.

Various scandals have rocked the industry, including evidence of highly placed executives in major firms soliciting sexual favors from aspiring models, and victimization of young models by unscrupulous agents. In 2000, the British Government declared plans for a ban on super-thin models in an attempt to reduce the increase of eating disorders among teenagers.

<p>My name is Christel Mack and I am the owner of a fused glass and mosaic studio, ScatCat Designs, in Ottawa, Canada.</p>
<p>Why am I doing this project?</p>
<p>There are hundreds if not thousands of docks for the newest iPhone on the market. But what are they? White or black plastic, aluminum, even wood. Really? That's it??? Definitely not going to cut it for a glass artist like myself who works with a myriad of colours every day. So, this is what I did...</p>
<p>I created a stylish, beautiful and fully functional design for an iPhone 4/4S dock, ‘StackDock’, made out of 42 handcut pieces of glass fused and stacked around an iPhone connector (please watch the video/slideshow and check out the gallery for photos). Unfortunately, with the small kiln that I currently have in my studio, it takes me two days (two full firings) to fuse the pieces required. My goal with this indiegogo project is to raise enough funds so that I can purchase a kiln that can fuse enough pieces for 8 docks at a time (one full firing), cutting my elapsed time down by 16-fold!</p>
<p>Breakdown of funds:</p>
<p>$4000 – 42” wide oval glass kiln</p>
<p>$800 – enough fusible glass for 100 docks</p>
<p>$200 – iPhone 4/4S connectors</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>
<p>-          Weight: 1 pound (due to the substantial weight, one hand can be used to attach and detach the iPhone without lifting the dock)</p>
<p>-          Dimensions: W 4 ½” D 3 ¼” H ~2”</p>
<p>-          Components: 42 handcut pieces of glass fused in a glass kiln into 12 different components; plastic connector (inside the unit); rubber feet (to stop the dock from moving on glass tables/desks)</p>
<p>-          What it supports: iPhone 4 and 4S</p>
<p>-          Colour!!!!</p>
<p>If you don't have an iPhone 4 or 4S, please look at the $10 and $25 perks, as they would make lovely Christmas gifts! Nah, I think you should just keep them for yourself :).</p></div>","Who am I?

<h3>Invisible Criminals is a non-profit initiative aimed at ending the conflict that has claimed more lives in the Congo than the Holocaust over minerals that are used in everyday technology. (more info: conflictminerals.org)</h3>
<p>The project is to make our logo on fair trade organic t-shirts (through American Apparel) and send $10 from every shirt sold to panzihospital.org in the Congo to help treat raped women who are prone to being shunned by their spouses and families due to the heightened AIDS risk. The situation in the Congo has been rated by the UN as the WORST human rights case out of ALL of the world's countries.<br/> With these shirts, we can help the Congo directly, as well as raise much-needed attention to this issue.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need a minimum of $2000 to make our first order of t-shirts which will then be available in Toronto stores as well as online at invisiblecriminals.org (currently under construction) As the project grows, the shirts will be available in more and more cities in Canada and the U.S. <br/>If we don't reach our goal, the money that has been raised will be given directly to Panzi Hospital.</p>
<p>Invisible Criminals' art has already been in NOW magazine and given interviews to OMNI television and independant media. All work done by I.C. is volunteer, as no one wants to profit from other people's suffering.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help:</p>
<p>If you can't donate money, you can still help out by getting properly informed on the subject of Coltan/Tantalum mining in the Congo: watch ""Blood in the Mobile"", or the ""VICE travel guide to Congo"", and please tell others, and try not to suppourt the blood mineral industry by only buying used phones and computers.

Il metodo è quello di contribuire e di aiutare gli IKH a stampare le loro nuove T-SHIRT ovviamente per farlo bisognera' produrle e questo costerà alla band circa 
700 euro !!
 
A questo punto se vuoi aiutarli puoi contribuire anche solo simbolicamente mettendo soltanto 1 EURO nel loro salvadanaio ;-)
 
OVVIAMENTE chi contribuirà con delle somme più alte 

di 1 EURO avrà un omaggio a seconda di quanto ha versato 

 
 
AD ESEMPIO :
 
con un minimo di 10 euro 
RICEVERAI la nuova t-shirt in omaggio una volta che sarà stampata
 
con un minimo di 20 euro 

RICEVERAI la nuova t-shirt + il loro nuovo cd ""family Album""

 
con un minimo di 25 euro 

RICEVERAI il loro primo cd + il loro nuovo cd ""family Album"" + la nuova t-shirt

 
 
I CONTRIBUTI SI VERSANO TRAMITE 
PAYPAL
 
NON E' UNA FREGATURA PERCHE' VI MANDEREMO NOI STESSI DELLA BAND I REGALI SAPENDO ESATTAMENTE CHI E QUANTO HA VERSATO !!!!
 
se non potete spendere almeno 10 euro potete comunque spendere di meno 
 

BASTA ANCHE SOLTANTO 1 EURO

Afterward, Justin understands how to look good and feel good. Simon is a combined major of business and computer science student (2nd yr) in the University of British Columbia. Simon specializes in the marketing aspects of the company (app design and promotion).Simon also had faced problems like Justin's. Simon usually consults his friends and relative on his appearance. However, Simon didn't think their opinion was useful enough. Thus, Simon suggested to Justin that they, together, should create an app that offers fashion feedback through peer evaluation.Jolie is a fashion designer with an impressive background and work experience in the fashion world: 

2006: Created Jolie Couture, which originally designed Haute Couture gowns worldwide, including in Canada, China and France


2009: Expanded the Jolie Couture business into organizing Fashion Shows, Charity Galas, and Photo Shoots and into providing Wardrobe Styling Advice


2010: Designed gowns for Canada's Medal Ceremony at the Vancouver 2010 Olympics

Who would use OutFeed?Our main users are females aged 15-35. These users range from youths to fashionistas who wants to know what they’re wearing is considered “liked” by the general population. Also, this market segment also seems to be active in providing feedback towards other users:

Geographic: Users of iOS and Android Operating Systems


Psychographic: People who care how they look.

Occupation: Students and young professionals

Our secondary customers are males also in the same age range, who may use the app on occasions such as before dates and interviews.
To improve the quality of fashion feedback and also fashion inspiration, we are creating premium accounts for fashion boutiques, bloggers and fashionistas.Here's a picture to describe the use of these accounts.How to make OutFeed be known?

Fashion Bloggers: We are contacting fashion bloggers and introducing them to our app. If necessary, we will also pay them to promote our app through their blogging platforms.

Fashion Industry Contacts: We seek advisors who can guide us and connect us to multiple fashion designers, and small boutique owners, which we believe will be the early adopters, and then help us to spread the app through word of mouth.
Campus Event: As students we have the advantage of launching events in UBC / SFU or any other large educational institution. We can set up a booth with mirrors, so that people can try out the app at the spot during our promotion. So far, we have a list of fifteen volunteers to help organize these booths.

Social Media: Since application is closely tied with Internet, promoting our app on social media is just an essential component in marketing.

Sponsorship: As a fashion app, we hope to improve peoples' confidence in their appearance. To start, we are going to sponsor a couple types of events so that they allocate an area for our booths.

Perks:
Here are some cool perks for the users or fashion boutiques:
$1 - Any bit of money helps. Thank you for being a friend.
$5 - ""Good job, guys!"", said by you.

$25 - ""Good guy contributor"". We will create a page on our website and app to recognize the contributors!
Use of Funding (Seed Round)After getting all these ""hugs"" and ""lunches"", this is the ratio on how we are planning to distribute the funds.

40% to app development for other mobile platforms.


40% to marketing. 


10% to legal / business admin.

<p>I moved to Hahn Air Force Base as a third grader in 1976, eventually graduating from Hahn High School in 1986. After moving to ""the States"" I continually had to explain ""where I went to high school.""

<p>HAHN HAWKS T-SHIRT</p>
<p>IF you still have a Hahn t-shirt, sweatshirt or letter jacket most likely it not longer fits. Let's make a new batch of Hahn Hawks t-shirts to wear proudly. Go HAWKS!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>HOW THIS WORKS</p>
<p>Just order a shirt. Order two. Order some for your mom, sister and cat. The more we make the better quality shirt I can order. If we exceed $300 I should be able to make some cool circular stickers too. Specify your size in a message with your payment or in an email to me. Remember, we're putting in an order and this campaign doesn't end until mid-November.</p>
<p>WHAT YOU GET</p>
<p>A green cotton t-shirt (short or long-sleeve), or sweatshirt with the design shown. I'd get one of each!</p>
<p>(Please remember IndieGoGo takes a cut of your contribution, I have to pay the graphic designer (thanks Doug Kubert!), the shirts need to be purchased and screen printed, and I need to pay for shipping.)</p>
<p>*By the way, the $500 goal is nuts--that is the minimum indiegogo allowed me to set. </p>

<h3>Storm Ventilation &amp; Fresh Water Retrieval System</h3>
</div>
<div>Latest version of the storm ventilation and fresh water retrieval system located at the apex of the roof where as my partner, Steve Quinlan, suggested might be a better location for gathering fresh water. The fan at right would be the ventilation for normal, non-storm times, pulling air through the house in the same way as an attic fan. In all cases there are floor vents in the loft and main floor areas so that air circulates through the whole building from the lowest and coolest area--under the house.<br/>
</div>
<div>The intake funnel would be protected from wind-borne debris by layers of screening of various weights, coarse to fine. Sturdy, long lasting PVC ball joints would regulate flow.</div>

<div>My partner, Steve Quinlan, has agreed to supply not only land to build on, but has also volunteered his wild bamboo stock and agreed to pay for some materials to build one, potentially two prototype houses-- a great opportunity to further the cause of providing inexpensive alternative disaster resistant container based construction. Building done right from the start. <br/>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Steve is a Canadian expat who lives on Jeju Island off the coast of South Korea with his Korean wife and two children. He and his wife, Sui are both English teachers and own a private English academy on the island. They have been residents of South Korea for many years, committed to continuing to live and work in South Korea and are both keenly interested in promoting concepts in alternative, sustainable living. To that end, they successfully purchased an electric vehicle with financial assistance provided by the Korean Federal Environment Ministry, The Jeju Provincial Government and Jeju Smart Grid  Department. This year The Jeju Government offered monetary incentives to over 600 lucky individuals toward the purchase of an EV. Why lucky? There was so much interest generated by the incentive, that the government had to conduct 2 lotteries, in the Spring and Summer, to allocate the funds. Next year, government incentives will be offered to only 1,500 lucky individuals. The Jeju Government has a very aggressive agenda to make the entire Island fossil fuel free. </span><br/>

<table><tbody><tr><td><p>Not a year ago, on November 8, 2013, Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda in the Philippines) struck that country causing  catastrophic damage and the deaths of more than 7,000 people and displacing 10's of millions more, mostly in Tacloban, the city that took the hardest hit and where I happened to visit briefly about two and a half years earlier. With sustained winds of 195 mph (314 kph) and gusts to 220 mph (354 kph), it was estimated to be the strongest storm to ever make landfall with wind speeds even greater than that of Hurricane Camille that hit the Gulf Coast of the U.S. in 1969. </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<b>Bahay kubo house, Philippines, c. 1895.</b><br/><br/><br/>This concept is the realization of traditional nipa hut, <i>bahay kubo</i>, architecture, above, combined with modern tent design on a  shipping container or conex base to create a synthesis that dispenses with traditional western style housing concepts. It is typhoon and earthquake resistant design that we have applied to both residential housing and multi-use buildings that can be built for a fraction of the cost <i>in the Philippines</i> of a western-style wood frame or masonry structure. Importantly, it is adaptable and flexible in the storm tossed climate of the tropics. It is non-traditional in concept, but logical, and pushes aside the craft and materials intensive construction methods of western architectural methods and adopts a different way of thinking for buildings in the tropics that is affordable, flexible, sustainable and safe.<br/><br/>
</td></tr></tbody></table>Living in a tropical climate differs greatly from temperate zone regions where protection against the cold for six months out of the year is the over-riding concern. Protection in the tropics is about short-term safety in the event of a severe storm--a typhoon, a hurricane, a cyclone. <br/><br/><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">_________________________________________________________________________</span></p>

This proposal changes that thinking in an area where extreme weather events are seasonally frequent, violent but short in duration and where the climate is largely calm with a consistent warm temperature--The Tropics. It's an active approach to building design in which spaces adapt and interact to various weather. Where masonry, stone and concrete are enduring, but also expensive and permanent, this method relies on an active flexibility using much less costly materials and craftsmanship--and uses both sparingly. It represents a low-cost method of building a living and working space using a core structure of cargo containers and a construction method allowing for a majority of the spaces to be folded up against the sides of the core for protection from severe weather. Quickly and easily, it folds inward for protection and expands outward when a storm has passed.<br/></p>

<h3>Earthquake Resistant Foundation Design</h3>
<p>Seismic engineers have to take two forces into consideration
when building for earthquake resistance. It came as a big surprise to everyone
when the Loma Prieta earthquake that jostled the Bay Area with a 7.0 force of
energy sheared off bolts a meter in diameter that formed the support for the
eastern section of the Bay Bridge. The bridge had been designed for vertical
earthquake forces, but to amazement, it was learned that lateral forces were at
play as well. Prior to that nerve racking event, as I was there, earlier
engineers from the Univ. of Calif./Berkeley had been working on an idea for
seismic cushion based the use of giant springs. I never knew what became of
that research, but at the time I thought it was an ingenious concept—coil and
cushion—both lateral and vertical. Like an undercarriage for a stagecoach or a
car.</p>
<p>I propose a design that uses tightly packed rubber for lateral and vertical
flexibility in combination with stability provided by heavy steel plates. Additional
vertical flex would be had by setting the support column of the house into a
steel collar inside which it can move up and down as the flex of rubber cushion
would allow. The rubber cushion would be supplied by used tires, truck tires
most probably which have a larger diameter, 100 cm. or greater in diameter. The
steel plates, smaller in diameter than the tires at 65 cm., could be manhole
covers. </p>

Except
for the outer tire, the tires have their sidewalls sheared off and are tightly
packed into a doughnut that is larger in diameter to that of the steel plate
(manhole cover) that sits as a part of a layered sandwich of metal and rubber.
The shaft of the wood stilt runs through this sandwich and floats within a
steel collar welded to another steel plate at the base, moving up and down with
vertical motion. The extending edges of the tightly packed rubber cushion of
tires act as cushion for lateral motion against the wall of the reinforced concrete
cylinder. </div>

Korean Prototype Building Construction Coming Soon
 
RQ Design Group will be launching 
a new campaign in November. 
Stay tuned.
Thanks for watching this idea unfold.













Storm Ventilation & Fresh Water Retrieval System

Latest version of the storm ventilation and fresh water retrieval system located at the apex of the roof where as my partner, Steve Quinlan, suggested might be a better location for gathering fresh water. The fan at right would be the ventilation for normal, non-storm times, pulling air through the house in the same way as an attic fan. In all cases there are floor vents in the loft and main floor areas so that air circulates through the whole building from the lowest and coolest area--under the house.

The intake funnel would be protected from wind-borne debris by layers of screening of various weights, coarse to fine. Sturdy, long lasting PVC ball joints would regulate flow.
___________________________________________________________________________


Also . . .

My partner, Steve Quinlan, has agreed to supply not only land to build on, but has also volunteered his wild bamboo stock and agreed to pay for some materials to build one, potentially two prototype houses-- a great opportunity to further the cause of providing inexpensive alternative disaster resistant container based construction. Building done right from the start. 


Steve is a Canadian expat who lives on Jeju Island off the coast of South Korea with his Korean wife and two children. He and his wife, Sui are both English teachers and own a private English academy on the island. They have been residents of South Korea for many years, committed to continuing to live and work in South Korea and are both keenly interested in promoting concepts in alternative, sustainable living. To that end, they successfully purchased an electric vehicle with financial assistance provided by the Korean Federal Environment Ministry, The Jeju Provincial Government and Jeju Smart Grid  Department. This year The Jeju Government offered monetary incentives to over 600 lucky individuals toward the purchase of an EV. Why lucky? There was so much interest generated by the incentive, that the government had to conduct 2 lotteries, in the Spring and Summer, to allocate the funds. Next year, government incentives will be offered to only 1,500 lucky individuals. The Jeju Government has a very aggressive agenda to make the entire Island fossil fuel free. 


I have known Steve since 2009. We are friends as well as colleagues and I welcome him to this effort.

The Story

“When you’re designing any architectural structure, the first step is to understand the location and context.”
               --Kaeper Kowalski, architect and photographer

Reason for this Campaign
Not a year ago, on November 8, 2013, Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda in the Philippines) struck that country causing  catastrophic damage and the deaths of more than 7,000 people and displacing 10's of millions more, mostly in Tacloban, the city that took the hardest hit and where I happened to visit briefly about two and a half years earlier. With sustained winds of 195 mph (314 kph) and gusts to 220 mph (354 kph), it was estimated to be the strongest storm to ever make landfall with wind speeds even greater than that of Hurricane Camille that hit the Gulf Coast of the U.S. in 1969. 




Bahay kubo house, Philippines, c. 1895.This concept is the realization of traditional nipa hut, bahay kubo, architecture, above, combined with modern tent design on a  shipping container or conex base to create a synthesis that dispenses with traditional western style housing concepts. It is typhoon and earthquake resistant design that we have applied to both residential housing and multi-use buildings that can be built for a fraction of the cost in the Philippines of a western-style wood frame or masonry structure. Importantly, it is adaptable and flexible in the storm tossed climate of the tropics. It is non-traditional in concept, but logical, and pushes aside the craft and materials intensive construction methods of western architectural methods and adopts a different way of thinking for buildings in the tropics that is affordable, flexible, sustainable and safe.
Living in a tropical climate differs greatly from temperate zone regions where protection against the cold for six months out of the year is the over-riding concern. Protection in the tropics is about short-term safety in the event of a severe storm--a typhoon, a hurricane, a cyclone. _________________________________________________________________________
Fold-Up Tent Design: Small Building





At top, the fold-up design partially folded up in preparation for a storm. At bottom, the structure folded out showing framework and awnings in place for protection from sun or rain and floor panels forming a veranda that extends all away around the building that can be used as sleeping, dining or work areas.


Fold-out stages of a house or small building

Most thinking about building design centers on sturdy passivity--a building sits, taking whatever nature throws at it. This proposal changes that thinking in an area where extreme weather events are seasonally frequent, violent but short in duration and where the climate is largely calm with a consistent warm temperature--The Tropics. It's an active approach to building design in which spaces adapt and interact to various weather. Where masonry, stone and concrete are enduring, but also expensive and permanent, this method relies on an active flexibility using much less costly materials and craftsmanship--and uses both sparingly. It represents a low-cost method of building a living and working space using a core structure of cargo containers and a construction method allowing for a majority of the spaces to be folded up against the sides of the core for protection from severe weather. Quickly and easily, it folds inward for protection and expands outward when a storm has passed.
These buildings will be designed with minimum skill set knowledge  and available resources available. Buildings would sit on stilts, minimizing foundation preparation expense and allowing for greater air circulation through floor and ceiling ventilation. The roof is steeply pitched, also for interior circulation benefit through vents in the tall ceiling as well as for exterior shedding of ash from a volcanic eruption which occur frequently in the Philippines.  
Floor panels, acting as large shutters, pull upward to cover the house completely in the event of a storm. Under those panels, the roof and wall awnings are used as a waterproofing barrier between the louvered windows and the floor panels, creating a sandwich of protective layers. 

Fold-Up Tent Design: Two Story Building


Above, shows the two-story multi-purpose building folded out.
These drawings show a a two story structure with a core of two 40-foot containers spaced eight feet apart with framed flooring and wall/window treatment between that give a total protected space of 1,820 sq. ft. (169 sq. m.) and a fold out space of 4,480 sq. ft. (416 sq. m.)

Below, the building folded up in preparation for a storm.



In an emergency this shelter provides:
1. Refuge in a storm--public emergency shelters built inexpensively whose purpose is to provide a temporary haven before and after a severe weather event.
2. Buildings where people can be cared for through a program of food and medical assistance in a place where emergency care can be provided in an accessible location.
Schools or other public buildings
Schools especially, with their open rooms can be multi-purpose buildings, providing not only a learning environment, but also act as a safe haven in storms or other catastrophic natural events. Perhaps a make-shift post office in an emergency where people need to receive funds from family overseas.
Business and residential
Shops or stores on the first floor, residential on the second level. Multi-use concepts can envision all sorts of applications in this modular, expandable building method._____________________________________________________________________________

The goal is to have enough capital to build two, preferably three, of these small buildings to work out the details of design and construction. A great portion of the work in designing and implementing these ideas will be carried out by the team, Steve and myself. Monies raised will cover building materials and contract work, consultation expenses on details of construction and design and finalizing plans. 
Lynn Ridenour: With experience in several fields--landscape designer and construction supervisor, newspaper management, in addition to other professional accomplishments, I have an broad background in arriving at practical solutions to myriad problems of design and solving logistical problems--especially my years as start-up production coordinator for American City Business Journals (ACBJ) where I assisted in the startup of nine business publications throughout the U.S. from 1980 to 1986 and was a key member of the team who developed the business model for successful business newspapers and as layout designer and photo editor of a series of award winning designs as I traveled from one city to another. Later, in 1998, I was a partner in the startup of On the Prairie, Art of the Land, a landscape company in Denver, Colo. that specialized in sustainable, xeric landscape design. In addition to that professional experience, during the years, I developed skills in a variety of building trades, including, but not limited to house construction and renovation that included carpentry, electrical, plumbing and interior/exterior construction and finishes, etc.
Also, I have some first hand appreciation of the power of storms, having spent time camping and experiencing some severe weather. Once, off the coast of California near Half Moon Bay, where a storm of more than 100 mph sustained winds and gusts to 125 mph buffeted my small tent, with me in it, perched overlooking the ocean on the bluff's edge--circumstances under which I gained some appreciation for tent architecture which I have applied to this design and construction approach to building.

Cable Tracking Device and Pole Support System



The drawing shows the assembly support for the combination roof and vertical members including a pulley for the steel cable that attaches to the roof. A little complex, but easily disassembled and assembled. This assembly process is in contrast to rope and bamboo which does not have this capability. Six of these are required for the small house illustrated above. Most of the parts are off the shelf. The 'U' shaped connectors may have to be manufactured. A tracking shield would be included so that the cable does not pop out of the groove of the pulley.
The mechanism supports four bamboo rails, two horizontal, one vertical and one lateral, plus supporting the steel cable which will give stability to the structure in breezes not strong enough to batten down the hatches for a bad storm.

Earthquake Resistant Foundation Design
Seismic engineers have to take two forces into consideration
when building for earthquake resistance. It came as a big surprise to everyone
when the Loma Prieta earthquake that jostled the Bay Area with a 7.0 force of
energy sheared off bolts a meter in diameter that formed the support for the
eastern section of the Bay Bridge. The bridge had been designed for vertical
earthquake forces, but to amazement, it was learned that lateral forces were at
play as well. Prior to that nerve racking event, as I was there, earlier
engineers from the Univ. of Calif./Berkeley had been working on an idea for
seismic cushion based the use of giant springs. I never knew what became of
that research, but at the time I thought it was an ingenious concept—coil and
cushion—both lateral and vertical. Like an undercarriage for a stagecoach or a
car.
I propose a design that uses tightly packed rubber for lateral and vertical
flexibility in combination with stability provided by heavy steel plates. Additional
vertical flex would be had by setting the support column of the house into a
steel collar inside which it can move up and down as the flex of rubber cushion
would allow. The rubber cushion would be supplied by used tires, truck tires
most probably which have a larger diameter, 100 cm. or greater in diameter. The
steel plates, smaller in diameter than the tires at 65 cm., could be manhole
covers. 

Except
for the outer tire, the tires have their sidewalls sheared off and are tightly
packed into a doughnut that is larger in diameter to that of the steel plate
(manhole cover) that sits as a part of a layered sandwich of metal and rubber.
The shaft of the wood stilt runs through this sandwich and floats within a
steel collar welded to another steel plate at the base, moving up and down with
vertical motion. The extending edges of the tightly packed rubber cushion of
tires act as cushion for lateral motion against the wall of the reinforced concrete
cylinder.

<p><strong>About our production</strong><br/>Everything we produce is minerally tanned. Mineral tanning ions being much smaller compared to vegetable tanning molecules, they can also mix much better with the leather at a smaller fiber level that vegetable tanning simply can’t reach.</p>
<p>This allows for thinner and softer leather that’s much more durable, resistant to humidity, fluids and even “wear and tear” over time. We also test leather thickness and resistance in a very thorough manner during our exclusive manufacturing process as well.</p>
