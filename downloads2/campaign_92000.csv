<p><i>„Personal Computer, DVD Player, music system,
game console… all this gets possible with Phonedock!“</i></p>
<p>A young
student made a mini-PC that fits in anyone’s pocket possible with „Phonedock“.
The idea is to connect a smartphone with a dockingstation to get a complete
personal computer. This dockingstation called Phonedock can also be connected
to a monitor to maximize the ease of use. Today the technical requirements of
modern smartphones can replace notebooks or desktop computers. Moreover, the
graphic performance of a modern smartphone is equal to your console in the
living room. If your hardware is not sufficient, no problem! Phonedock allows
you to increase the performance. With Phonedock you have all your music,
movies, games and documents with you every time. Dock and get started. </p>
<p>Using a
HDMI cable, the signal of your smartphone is transmitted to a monitor or tv
screen. You can connect a mouse, keyboard or controller by using the bluetooth
function. Phonedock gives you the necessary stability, even if you only want to
watch movies or surf on the internet. While your smartphone is docked the
battery gets charged and the device gets cooled down: the cooling fan
guarantees an underrating performance.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/422330/files/20140309153937-Schnappschuss-_2014-03-05-22.40.00_.jpg?1394404777"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>

<h3><b>So what exactly is gestureKit?</b></h3>
<br/>We have developed a non-intrusive, transparent overlay that allows you - developer or designer - to assign gesture commands to any app. You can run gestureKit smoothly on top of all the native and interactive elements of your apps without any fuss. The Indiegogo campaign will help us to move from touch to gesture sensors plus reach new markets, more of that detail to follow…</div>

<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>Where will your money go?</h2>
<p></p>
<p><br/><b>For the end user</b>, we aim to create an end user gesture customization service based on gestureKit, online customization and cloud gestures called <b>DrawAction</b>. Available for developers as an extended feature and for end users as input types, DarwAction is the visible face of gestureKit and the way to interact directly with end users. </p>

<div>
<p>A gesture is the combination of a drawing and code that executes an action or UI. That code can be shared between developers in our open source repository of gestures. We call them <b><i>gestureActions </i></b>and <b><i>gesturePlugins</i></b>, which developers will be able to clone and modify according to their needs.<br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>gestureActions</b>: for those who do not have development experience. A block of code that is triggered with gestures can ultimately be dragged and dropped on the backoffice once approved.</li>
<li>
<b>gesturePlugin</b>: for developers who want to enhance the a specific plugin and develop UI features and new interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>Our job is to assign the gestures into our tracking system, test their codes and submit them to be rated by the community, which will generate reliable standards, set <b>by the community for the community</b>, for a true open source experience. Chekout RoamTouch <a href=""https://github.com/RoamTouch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">repository</a>.</p>
<p>Once you submit  a gestureAction or gesturePlugin, we add it to the tracking list so every developer and visitor can understand that <b>gesture on a summary  card</b>.</p>

</div></div>","GestureKit: A new SDK that makes ‘gestures’ super easy to implement on any mobile-web interface app .
 







               
We are team based in San Francisco, Buenos Aires and Rumania of gesture experts who have created the world’s first easy-to-use cross-platform tool for gesture-driven apps. 

gestureKit simplifies the  integration and implementation of custom gestures by a unique draw, generate and use process.  No messing with your developing process like some of those fiddly gesture tools out there, we have taken the pain out of that.



          





So what exactly is gestureKit?
We have developed a non-intrusive, transparent overlay that allows you - developer or designer - to assign gesture commands to any app. You can run gestureKit smoothly on top of all the native and interactive elements of your apps without any fuss. The Indiegogo campaign will help us to move from touch to gesture sensors plus reach new markets, more of that detail to follow…



        



Topline, here are the gestureKit features:


Manage gestures on the cloud 
Reduces development time and costs - one line of code 
Easy to integrate 
Complementary dashboard and analytics
Great tool for wearable 



Easy implementation, and process to follow
Any app creator knows that integrating gesture control for applications across multiple platforms is a very tedious process. With gestureKit, you can now easily do this without the pain of re-programming from scratch on every platform. Here is the process:

Subscribe or login with Github.
Create the application and gestureset at the DashBoard (see Getting Started Guide).
Draw the gestures online or at the gestureKit recorder app.
Implement the gestureset on your code.



For our fellow geeks, here is the code:





Could we make it any easier for you? Follow the steps above without even coding and boom! You have yourself human-to-computer functionality : )


For a better recording experience, we have developer the GestureKit Recorded application for Android.


               See the results online at your Dashboard!          

             
               



Oh, did you remember? We’re cross platform : ) 

Check out our GKPlayer demos for iOS, Android and Web platforms. 




Easy to manageWe offer a easy-to-use dashboard to create, edit and store unique gestures in the cloud, as well as to view metrics of gesture activity conducted by end-users.
Our gesture vision
We have finished a big chunk of our research work and development and  have gestureKit up and running with the online editor, plugins for iOS, Android and Web, and we have created a demo application to showcase our technology. We have built our web platform and we continue improving it every day. We are in the process of building our very  gesture ecosystem.



Where will your money go?

For the end user, we aim to create an end user gesture customization service based on gestureKit, online customization and cloud gestures called DrawAction. Available for developers as an extended feature and for end users as input types, DarwAction is the visible face of gestureKit and the way to interact directly with end users. 


                       

For developers, creating closed thematic kits (Developer Kits), enhancing and consolidating the API, creating a storage and distribution standard based on gesturesets that apply to specific application views, adding more clients like LeapMotion, W8 and Unity, creating new particles for visual representation and providing new features to the the recognition engine like runtime recognition. Also integrate new gestures technologies like touch-less sensed gestures, air-gestures and 3D gestures as part of the roadmap.




With your support we plan to move our product into an amazing selection of markets.  We have developed use cases that are ready to be developed, but we lack the economic resources to make them happen. Your contributions will free-up the use gesture features in the markets we plan to reach. 


Lastly, consolidate the human machinery in order to comply with all these tasks in time.

Why crowdfunding?


Because we believe that much remains to be done in terms of gesture technology and we have the idea of ​​encouraging interaction activities in a community that has a space in our platform and Open Source content to develop new ideas. 
We are asking for help to make gestures as a service that can provide social support for people with disabilities, health problems or communication to which institutions have convened with which we will face joint projects. 



Which industries can benefit from gestureKit technology?


The potential of gestureKit to make a remarkable impact in many industries such as healthcare, automotive, original equipment manufacturer, game and entertainment systems, personal productivity, wearable technology and security.


                    
For example Jasmine Dumas is a Medical Device Engineer with a BSE in Biomedical Engineering and is working with us on gestureCare Lab with the idea of developing a sample 'Pain Management App' that incorporates an initial user prompt once an hour to quantify their current pain experience to promote communication and adherence to physician prescribed treatment and personal journaling of illnesses. Your contribution could help shape this development in medical industry.



Your contributions will also encourage activity within our open source gesture community




A gesture is the combination of a drawing and code that executes an action or UI. That code can be shared between developers in our open source repository of gestures. We call them gestureActions and gesturePlugins, which developers will be able to clone and modify according to their needs.


gestureActions: for those who do not have development experience. A block of code that is triggered with gestures can ultimately be dragged and dropped on the backoffice once approved.

gesturePlugin: for developers who want to enhance the a specific plugin and develop UI features and new interactions.

Our job is to assign the gestures into our tracking system, test their codes and submit them to be rated by the community, which will generate reliable standards, set by the community for the community, for a true open source experience. Chekout RoamTouch repository.
Once you submit  a gestureAction or gesturePlugin, we add it to the tracking list so every developer and visitor can understand that gesture on a summary  card.




There is also an opportunity for computer animators and motion graphic artists to shine with gestureKit, creating beautiful animated traces for gestures and visual effects, inspired on the legendary pixie-dust, nyan cats or...surprise us!





As a developer, UX designer and as part of the gestureKit community you will have a user ID that will allow you to manage the dashboard, interact in forums, post on blogs and interact with other people in the industry on Labs. We are creating an ecosystem, an optimal environment to stimulate the community to discuss and exchange ideas about gestures and their influence in our life styles.


UXg stand for User Experience for Gestures. Technically, it is an extension of user experience.

*** This campaign is finished, you can get an EzTemp today on <a href=""http://www.fabricadigital.eu/tienda/eztemp-sensor-de-temperatura-y-humedad-para-raspberry-pi/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fábrica Digital</a> (Spanish) and <a href=""https://www.tindie.com/products/makelab/eztemp-easy-temperature-and-humidity-for-rpi/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tindie</a> (English) ***<br/><br/>Air temperature and relative humidity are very common parameters that need to be measured. We've been using the well-known DHT22 but we find it very innacurate as well as unstable.<br/><br/>

Also, Raspberry Pi doesn't come with a built-in ADC, and using analog sensors isn't easy.<br/><br/>

That's why we've created EzTemp&amp;RH! :)<br/><br/>With EzTemp&amp;RH you get a professional relative humidity sensor by Honeywell and an accurate thermistor that you can read using your UART pins on Raspberry Pi, your PC or any other serial-capable device.<br/><div align=""center"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/950762/files/20141022064722-20141021_115730_411.jpg?1413985642"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
</div>

You just send a 1-byte command to the EzTemp&amp;RH and it will take readings of humidity, temperature and an external signal you connect. EzTemp&amp;RH will send the data back through the serial port.

It can be used with any A/C that has a remote control.              Sensibo supports any A/C that can be used with a remote control. Sensibo uses IR commands to communicate with your existing A/C, just like your remote control. It works right out of the box and supports any remote controlled A/C: Window A/Cs, Split, central, standing, etc.      You don’t need to teach Sensibo anything. Remote control commands are pre-installed, ready to communicate with your existing A/C.   Check out how the Sensibo Pod is installed          Sensibo's app comes packed with amazing features:IFTTT integration, scheduling, timer and more.             You might have a Samsung in the living room, an LG in the bedroom and a Friedrich in the study and yet, Sensibo allows you to control all of them using one simple interface.  In order to extend the range of the Sensibo Pods, we designed Sensibo to have two parts: one smart hub that connects to your home router, and a Sensibo Pod for each of your air conditioners. This design also helps make Sensibo more affordable. Sensibo is 100% mobile and transferable. We opted for 3M: Command™ mounting tape, super strong and easily attachable to any surface and most importantly, the pod can slide right off your A/C without leaving a trace.   The Sensibo pod is composed of two parts: a mounting unit that attaches to the A/C surface, and the main pod unit. The main pod unit floats on a magnetic axis around the mounting unit.        We respect air conditioners. They represent a century's worth of research in the field of thermodynamics. When we first thought about a world with smart air conditioners, we realized it would be too expensive and unnecessary to build a smart A/C from scratch.Air conditioners are really great at what they do, cool and heat.They just don't know when to do what. Sensibo gives A/Cs the power of insight, and the ability to adjust to your lifestyle.    Each Sensibo pod is powered by two micro-processors. We chose to work with Texas Instrument’s CC2538 as the main MCU. It runs a 802.15.4 low power RF standard with 6LoWPAN protocol on top. The secondary MCU is Texas Instrument’s CC2541, running Bluetooth Low Energy and supports iBeacon. Sensibo runs on two powerful standard CR123A batteries   Sensibo is equipped with 6 tiny super strong Infra-red emitters pointed in all directions. This way it's easy to place the pod on your A/C and it just works.        Omer Enbar is the CEO of Sensibo. Omer is a devoted maker, with vast experience in product. Prior to Sensibo, Omer worked on products both for consumers and for the professional market. Omer holds a BSc. in computer science.Ran Roth is the CTO of Sensibo. Prior to Sensibo Ran worked as an algorithm researcher at Yahoo. Ran is a technology and science enthusiast. He holds an MSc. in algorithm and a BSc. in Physics and Maths. Before Sensibo, Ran worked on many challenging algorithmic problems in the field of BigData, Computer Vision and Control Theory. He also has a wide knowledge and experience in software development.Dror Bren is the Creative Director of Sensibo. He’s an experienced industrial and UX designer and holds an MDes in design management and a BDes in Industrial design. Prior to Sensibo, Dror has worked at BRIO Interaction Design, developing interfaces for some of Israel’s leading startups.       One of the coolest things about Sensibo is that we are working on integrating with various platforms.Sensibo has an active IFTTT channel, which lets you use your creativity and innovation to create recipes that use Sensibo's abilities.       I have a central air conditioning system. Can I use Sensibo?Yes, central air conditioning is supported if your system has a remote control (even if you lost it).What's the difference between Sensibo and Nest?Nest replaces your existing wired thermostat. If you have a remote controlled air conditioner you can't use Nest or a similar solution. Sensibo can be used with any remote controlled A/C.How does the Sensibo Pod connect to the A/C?The Sensibo Pod is completely external to your air conditioner. It has no wires. It controls the A/C using IR commands, in the same manner your remote control does.How does the Sensibo smart hub connect to the internet?The Sensibo smart hub connects to the internet through your home router. The connection is done using a regular ethernet cable. We chose to use ethernet over WiFi for our smart hub because it's easier to install, more secure and there's no need for updating passwords.Can I schedule Sensibo to turn on the air conditioner?Yes. The app lets you easily schedule the A/C to your routine. Even better - you can set the scheduler to work only if it’s hot or cold.How much time do the batteries last?Sensibo is very power efficient and uses strong batteries that last 3-6 months with normal usage.Does Sensibo measure relative humidity?Yes. Relative humidity and temperature are incorporated into a thermal comfort model. Does Sensibo have an API?We are working on providing an API. Once released, Sensibo will offer a rich API that lets you control the air conditioner and read the data from the sensors.  * Dog image courtesy of Rolland Budi (cc-by-sa 2.0)",29.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h2>
<br/>Where We Started</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Automobiles are our “2nd home” since we spend a significant amount of time in our cars every day. The Internet brought huge changes to the world, but very little to a car. Many motorists had dreamed of driving a “smart car” that not only provide simple navigation and music, but also execute our voice command and respond back like Google Now or Siri; and in addition to our favorite streaming music from Pandora, Spotify or Rdio, we could also enjoy the performance and the convenience of thousands of Apps such as Waze, Yelp and others.</p>
<p><br/>Tablets and smart phones have been put on trials in our test vehicle and the result has not been satisfactory. So, our 4-person development team took the challenge and designed a 2 DIN head unit built-in to the vehicle’s in-dash panel, and now, we make this motorists’ dream come true:</p>
<p><br/><b>Android In-Dash System Combined 3G+ mobile Internet on the go.</b></p>
<p><br/>Compared to large auto companies who try and have this kind of system installed in their cars, and charge their customers a premium, what we would like to provide to the drivers community with even a better, open system on a DIY basis, so that most cars, new or used, would easily become a “smart car” with simple and easy installation.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We Have Achieved</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We have finished all the design, aging test and road test of our Android in-dash system. We are able to provide dedicated head units for over 60 car models, and in addition 2 DIN universal designs for a number of car models with square shape head units. Now, we need your support to put them into a production line so we can bring the smart car on the road.</p>
<p>The design comes with ARM Cortex A8 CPU, power management, audio output amplifier, FM/AM radio, Bluetooth and GPS that follow the aftermarket standard. Your traditional infotainment system continues to function in terms of features and quality, and with our in-dash system, it now has freedom with Internet and open Android platform.</p>
<p>Here is the highlight feature list:</p>
<ul>
<li> Android 4.0</li>
<li> ARM Cortex A8 up to 1.5G CPU</li>
<li> 1G DDR3, 4G FLASH ROM</li>
<li> USB 3G Dongle</li>
<li> Wi-Fi</li>
<li> Webcam for DVR</li>
<li> 1080P 30fps video playback</li>
<li> FM/AM radio</li>
<li> GPS</li>
<li> Bluetooth hands free and A2DP music</li>

<h2>How We Have Come So Far</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Our professional expertise in mobile communication and vehicle infotainment system have allowed us to achieve successful designs and overcome numerous obstacles after countless days and nights of hard work and on-going testing. Our team has been able to fix details &amp; issues with both the hardware and the software. Such endeavors are usually done in the large labs of brand name auto makers who like to have the system built-in and charge their clients a premium. We are proud of the fact that with the efforts of a small professional team, we make ourselves part of the world’s transportation revolution by connecting our most important living spaces besides home and office into Internet and taste the change by Internet and Apps.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How We Would Use the Funds</h2>
<p><br/>Your support will help us to take a solid step forward of our “connected car project”: putting it into batch production. <br/>$1500 is required for each of the 60 car models we currently support to manufacture the panel plastic boards and other related parts. When ready, we would move forward to start batch production of a minimum 100 units per batch. The mother board, Android board and other components are common parts shared among all models. The funds will be used to produce minimum dedicated parts and the first batch of common parts.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Model List</h2>
<h3>
<br/>1) Universal model</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Universal model is to be used in normal square shape in-dash panel. There are many cars which applied 2DIN square shape in-dash system. If your car cannot use universal or any dedicated panel, a 3D-printing cover with a universal device might be a cool choice.</p>

<p><span><span></span></span><span>Hi there! We are Ronald, Jurriaan and Max and we want to make a dent in the universe... We’ve all worked for different agencies, with different clients and a lot of different designers and developers. And that, my friends, is exactly how we got inspired to start Clickmodels. A prototyping app for designers and the perfect bridge between designers, developers and clients.</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/140094/files/20131018021805-team.png?1382087885"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><span>Clickmodels in a nutshell</span></h2>
<p>Millions of designers, clients and developers worldwide are part of the complex process prior to the release of an online project. All of them are looking for new ways to speed up their workflow and presenting and selling their product better. For designers, creating a quick but good working prototype is not always that easy. With Clickmodels that will be made so much easier, more fun and obvious to do.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/168666/files/20131101083838-whatisit.png?1383320318"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>What we'll do for designers</h2>
<p>We’ve got a lot of great and advanced functionalities specially for designers. Whether you just want to create clickmodels of simple webpages or prefer advanced and interactive onepagers. Clickmodels is the app to present, build, review, test, and finish up your design.</p>
<h2>..for developers</h2>
<p>Developers are going to love this stuff. Send your developer your clickmodel and you make it possible for him to see specifications like colours, margins, paddings and assets. Also handy tools like hover states, mirroring and crop &amp; save tools are things developers just can’t go without. It will save the developer a lot of time creating the pixel-perfect product that everybody will love and nobody needs to sit next to a developer for hours anymore. Win win situation, right?</p>
<h2>..for your beloved clients</h2>
<p>It’s time to get rid of the dozens of emails with tons of annotations and revisions from your clients. Hold your conversation there where it’s meant to be. Send your beloved client your clickmodel and let them review and approve all your designs one by one. Reduce emails, phonecalls or even text messages.</p>
<h2>Why we think you’ll love it</h2>
<p>There are millions of designers worldwide producing and pitching dozens of websites everyday. All of them are looking for new ways to speed up their workflow and presenting and selling their product better. That’s where we come in. None of the available tools on the market allows designers, developers and clients to work together so efficiently using 1 single tool. Clickmodels does just that. Some say it’s magic, we just want to create the perfect bridge between designer, developer and client. </p>
<p>We believe that with Clickmodels we can take away a lot of struggles among designers, developers and clients. With the experience we’ve gathered over the past decade we know very well what these struggles are and how we can take away the biggest part of it.</p>
<h2>A handful of functions you’ll love</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/140095/files/20131018021913-functionalities.png?1382087953"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><span>Why do we need your money </span></h2>
<p>Development takes a lot of time, a lot. We’re currently building Clickmodels with just two developers. The newest and state of the art functions we’re working on (not shown in the image above) are mindblowing but are going to take up hundreds and hundreds of extra hours of development. To make our dream become reality and to let it work perfectly we need your support to buy more manpower, brains and beards. The more we raise, the sooner we can get our hands on some extra developers. Your money is well spend and we know for sure you’ll love the final result.</p>

Hi there! We are Ronald, Jurriaan and Max and we want to make a dent in the universe... We’ve all worked for different agencies, with different clients and a lot of different designers and developers. And that, my friends, is exactly how we got inspired to start Clickmodels. A prototyping app for designers and the perfect bridge between designers, developers and clients.


Clickmodels in a nutshell
Millions of designers, clients and developers worldwide are part of the complex process prior to the release of an online project. All of them are looking for new ways to speed up their workflow and presenting and selling their product better. For designers, creating a quick but good working prototype is not always that easy. With Clickmodels that will be made so much easier, more fun and obvious to do.



What we'll do for designers
We’ve got a lot of great and advanced functionalities specially for designers. Whether you just want to create clickmodels of simple webpages or prefer advanced and interactive onepagers. Clickmodels is the app to present, build, review, test, and finish up your design.
..for developers
Developers are going to love this stuff. Send your developer your clickmodel and you make it possible for him to see specifications like colours, margins, paddings and assets. Also handy tools like hover states, mirroring and crop & save tools are things developers just can’t go without. It will save the developer a lot of time creating the pixel-perfect product that everybody will love and nobody needs to sit next to a developer for hours anymore. Win win situation, right?
..for your beloved clients
It’s time to get rid of the dozens of emails with tons of annotations and revisions from your clients. Hold your conversation there where it’s meant to be. Send your beloved client your clickmodel and let them review and approve all your designs one by one. Reduce emails, phonecalls or even text messages.
Why we think you’ll love it
There are millions of designers worldwide producing and pitching dozens of websites everyday. All of them are looking for new ways to speed up their workflow and presenting and selling their product better. That’s where we come in. None of the available tools on the market allows designers, developers and clients to work together so efficiently using 1 single tool. Clickmodels does just that. Some say it’s magic, we just want to create the perfect bridge between designer, developer and client. 
We believe that with Clickmodels we can take away a lot of struggles among designers, developers and clients. With the experience we’ve gathered over the past decade we know very well what these struggles are and how we can take away the biggest part of it.
A handful of functions you’ll love



Why do we need your money 
Development takes a lot of time, a lot. We’re currently building Clickmodels with just two developers. The newest and state of the art functions we’re working on (not shown in the image above) are mindblowing but are going to take up hundreds and hundreds of extra hours of development. To make our dream become reality and to let it work perfectly we need your support to buy more manpower, brains and beards. The more we raise, the sooner we can get our hands on some extra developers. Your money is well spend and we know for sure you’ll love the final result.
Awesome rewards
Every perk comes with a subscription, the higher the perk the bigger the total package. Check out our perks on the right side of the screen and take a look at the impressions of the merchandise we will send you for your support.

<br/><strong>Hey, I’m Brian, co-founder of Halo Effect!</strong>
</h2><p>Over the past 5 years, co-founder Dave Reeb and I have launched dozens of products, including <strong>iPhone and iPad accessories</strong> <strong>sold in Apple stores worldwide</strong>, and we're excited to launch our most important product line yet.</p><p>Designed to fit <strong>most popular smartphones</strong> (like <strong>iPhone, Galaxy S, Pixel</strong>, and others), Halo Effect reinvents your day from wake to sleep, using a series of mounts that allow you to be a better you.  Whether you are an athlete, a parent, a student, an executive, a driver, an artist, or all of the above, this kit will empower your day.</p><p>Do you use a case for protection or style, or do you prefer to keep it thin and light? No worries. You can do <strong>both</strong>, or <strong>either</strong>, and even <strong>change your mind later</strong>. Three of the bases that come with your kit were designed to <strong>work with cases up with 2.5 mm in thickness.</strong> For example, if you have an Apple iPhone 7 with a leather Apple case, you will simply switch from the #3 base to the #4 base. We’ll lay it all out in the directions that will come with your kit.</p><p>The bottom line: no smartphone mount system has ever had any three of these capabilities packaged together, and <strong>solutions that try to meet even half the functions of Halo Effect cost more.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519854922/jcw9bmfhptkdq7obeepf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Each kit comes with 6 bases to fit most major smart phones with a case or without (see chart)</i></p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519856751/ngnbk7c0adzimgje6p2b.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The Play-Perform mount is the integral hub of the kit.</i></p><h2>The first all-in-one smartphone kit</h2><p>Halo Effect’s all-in-one kit provides mounts with four unique and fundamentally important functions—<strong>RUN+RIDE, DRIVE+DIRECT, PLAY+PERFORM, SHARE+STREAM.</strong> </p><p>A quick overview:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Run+Ride</strong> — lightest &amp; smallest, rotates 7 snaps-on/off upper &amp; lower arm.</li>
<li>
<strong>Drive+Direct</strong> — secure, any-view, ultra-portable, any-view car vent mount.</li>
<li>
<strong>Play+Perform</strong> — most functional any-view,table-top, counter, and desk stand.</li>
<li>
<strong>Share+Stream</strong> — any-view smooth-surface multi-mount (for glass, walls, etc.)</li>
</ul><p>Thanks to Halo Effect's smart design, switching between each mode is seamless: just slide and clip when you’re on to your next activity.<strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525366126/ztdazyypg4yyzctv6yly.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><div>

<br/> </h2></div>","Introducing HaloEffect
Hey, I’m Brian, co-founder of Halo Effect!
Over the past 5 years, co-founder Dave Reeb and I have launched dozens of products, including iPhone and iPad accessories sold in Apple stores worldwide, and we're excited to launch our most important product line yet.Designed to fit most popular smartphones (like iPhone, Galaxy S, Pixel, and others), Halo Effect reinvents your day from wake to sleep, using a series of mounts that allow you to be a better you.  Whether you are an athlete, a parent, a student, an executive, a driver, an artist, or all of the above, this kit will empower your day.Do you use a case for protection or style, or do you prefer to keep it thin and light? No worries. You can do both, or either, and even change your mind later. Three of the bases that come with your kit were designed to work with cases up with 2.5 mm in thickness. For example, if you have an Apple iPhone 7 with a leather Apple case, you will simply switch from the #3 base to the #4 base. We’ll lay it all out in the directions that will come with your kit.The bottom line: no smartphone mount system has ever had any three of these capabilities packaged together, and solutions that try to meet even half the functions of Halo Effect cost more.Each kit comes with 6 bases to fit most major smart phones with a case or without (see chart)The Play-Perform mount is the integral hub of the kit.The first all-in-one smartphone kitHalo Effect’s all-in-one kit provides mounts with four unique and fundamentally important functions—RUN+RIDE, DRIVE+DIRECT, PLAY+PERFORM, SHARE+STREAM. A quick overview:

Run+Ride — lightest & smallest, rotates 7 snaps-on/off upper & lower arm.

Drive+Direct — secure, any-view, ultra-portable, any-view car vent mount.

Play+Perform — most functional any-view,table-top, counter, and desk stand.

Share+Stream — any-view smooth-surface multi-mount (for glass, walls, etc.)
Thanks to Halo Effect's smart design, switching between each mode is seamless: just slide and clip when you’re on to your next activity.

 
 

What the press and you tubers are saying
 
 ""...a solution for all of those ways and places we use smartphones ...a hands-free kit that includes a universal base for your device that plugs into three unique mounts for driving, running or biking, and working.""  —Fast Company   
""With HaloEffect, one clever phone attachment has the ability to directly attach the the rest of the mounts in the system, creating a more seamless experience...Overall, this is probably the best stab at streamlining the hands-free lifestyle I've seen yet."" —Core77 
""...It’s unique in that it comes in a kit and puts four functions together."" —Technical.ly

It leaves no residue when removed, and can be easily replaced to reposition the mount somewhere else if you change your mind (we even provide a free second strip just in case).Perfect for dual-screen video conferencing, keeping your phone away from kids' sticky fingers, checking recipes while cooking, and more. It fits like a glove - using 6 Swappable Bases Have a case?  Swap the base.    For the phones listed above, if you want to use a case, you can simply swap the base to fit whatever thin-walled case you like (with case wall thickness less than a 2.5mm ) - like the Apple case on an iPhone shown below.   Halo Effect is roughly 1/3 the cost! Timeline Perks Our processThis is our most all-encompassing project yet, and we've been working on it for well over a year. That may sound like a long time — maybe it is — but it went by fast. We had some false-starts, made dozens of unique prototypes, yelled at the sky a few times, and spent lots of hours in the lab and in the field testing and refining.We grabbed some of the best ideas from our ZeroChroma roots (and the very capable brain of my business partner Dave), tweaked and optimized each one, and then combined them in a way that will transform your day. Even though it took plenty of roll-up-your-sleeves ingenuity, and hard work, we feel lucky to have had such a simple, seamless solution fall into place. Although we have had the good fortune to work together on a few award-winning one-of-kind products, this kit was the most fun in recent memory. We hope your process of discovery matches ours.Our process designing Halo Effect. Why Indiegogo?We're really excited to bring this project to life—and we thought crowdfunding would be the perfect way to go. Our smartphones have now become so personalized, we all need them for different uses. That's why we created a kit that allows for a slew of different activities—to fit any lifestyle, anywhere. Given the democratic nature of crowdfunding, we knew this would be the perfect place to create a community and make this project a reality.TeamDave  and I  are so thankful to each and every member of our team (both past and present) with a special thanks to Jeremy Carpenter, Teri Chrissomallis, Michele Dierking, Laura Siciliano, Steven Wright, Patrick Francisco, Nathan Li, Mike Woods and Hugh Smallwood.With over 20 years of manufacturing and supply chain experience in Asia, Europe, Mexico and the U.S., we are picky and demanding. Our manufacturing partners GPA Global out of Shenzhen and UTS in Taipei City are simply the best.  They make the complex look simple, and they do it on time and on spec.We can't wait to get the Halo Effect into your hands!  Thank you!",29.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Orbbec Persee is the world's first camera-computer. This versatile, low-cost device can plug into your TV/monitor, or it can run without a display and you can interact with it entirely through the built-in 3D camera.</p><p>Its ability to see, hear, and understand makes it much smarter
than a regular computer. And its powerful built-in ARM processor makes it much
more useful than single-use devices. Persee is the ideal smart home device, but
that’s just the beginning...</p>

<p>Our mission is to create intelligent technologies for every human, everywhere.<br/></p>
<div>
</div>
<p>For computers to be intelligent, they need more than the ability to make sense of the world around them—they need to see the world in 3D. And for intelligent computing to flourish, excellent 3D cameras that are affordably priced and universally available will be a necessity.</p>
<div>
</div>
<p>We
believe that in the future, it will be hard to remember a time when computers
didn’t have 3D cameras.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Orbbec has been working for the past three years to develop the best 3D cameras on the market as well as to create an entirely new category of 3D technology: a camera with a  built-in, fully functioning computer. Now we’re ready to share our new device with you. </p>
<p>Orbbec Persee is the world’s first 3D camera-computer. It is a versatile, low-cost device that you can hold in your hand. It can plug into your TV or run without a display, and you can interact with it entirely through the built-in 3D camera.</p>
<p>We want artists, makers, creative coders, researchers, and pioneering developers to use Persee, give us feedback, and build 3D experiences that take intelligent computing to the next level.</p>
<p>We’re ready to start mass producing our devices and we’re looking for Indiegogo supporters to back our campaign to raise the funds we need to bring Persee to the world.</p>

<h2>What people are saying about Orbbec</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s clear that Orbbec ""gets it"" and really wants to support new forms of experimental interaction design and creative exploration. Their charming little Astra depth sensor is a tidy, cross-platform, easy-to-use (and USB bus-powered!) device that actually works with today's operating systems. And their Persee device is an altogether novel beast that will turn robotics on its ear and revolutionize how we track bodies in space. Clip it to the ceiling and you've got skeletons streaming over OSC! This is going to be hella fun.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Orbbec team’s dedication and expertise never ceases to amaze me. It’s no surprise they are now leading the creation of a new category of 3D devices with the introduction of the Orbbec Persee camera-computer. It is a long awaited and much needed catalyst for the development of creative, intelligent computing experiences. Reaching this level of 3D sophistication, at an affordable price, is groundbreaking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My company has been building interactive production applications for 3D cameras for many years, but despite how promising some of the early technology has been; it still isn’t good enough. Orbbec is solving many of the core quality issues that have prevented gesture from becoming a norm by which we interface with computer systems. I believe them when they say they are committed to doing 3D right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It'sgreat to see a company that has been working with developers from day one. From the little things, like power over USB, having a built-in quarter-inch mount, to the really important things like being completely cross-platform, providing high quality depth data, and avoiding ambiguous legal restrictions, they've done everything right. This is the successor to the Kinect.</p>

<p>What I love about Orbbec is they are thinking about the problems they are solving with a long term view. Sure, they are developing amazing 3D cameras, yet they’re doing a bunch more than that. They have also designed their own 3D chip, are developing an SDK, and  have their own manufacturing line so they can control cost and ensure device availability. Orbbec understands that vision based tech isn’t just about the hardware, it’s about the whole ecosystem and the systems that power the hardware.</p>

</h2></div>
Every project involves risk and encounters challenges. We’ve done our best to minimize the risks. Here’s a timeline of everything we’ve done so far to make sure these products are a success:<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443640417/pvto8mkanzksu505wa4k.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>l<span>  </span></span><b>Does the
product work yet?</b></p>
<p>Yes! We already have a
working product. We’ve been developing this technology for three years with an
incredibly talented and smart team. Our 3D sensor is ready for developers, and
in fact some of our early partners have already been testing and using the sensors
for several months. </p>
<p><span>l<span>  </span></span><b>Can you
actually mass-produce these? Can you ship on time?</b></p>
<p>Yes! We have already
invested a great deal into establishing manufacturing lines dedicated to mass
producing our building our sensors. That’s why we’re ready to ship the Astra
cameras <i>immediately </i>after the campaign ends. The Astra Pro
and Persee devices need a little more time to prepare for their manufacturing,
but we are confident that we can produce and ship those products to our
Indiegogo backers on schedule.</p>
<p><span>l<span>  </span></span><b>Are your
products certified for sale?</b></p>
<p>Yes! The Astra
camera already has approval from FCC, CE, IC, and CB, and is ready to ship
world-wide.</p>
<p></p>
<p>                                             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443472395/g2vclmis2fiktvekszdh.png"" src="""" style=""width: 282.58px; height: 245px;""/></p>
<br/>
<p>The cameras
inside Astra Pro and Persee are mostly the same components as in Astra, and the
individual components that make up the computer in Persee have already passed
certifications when used in other products. With our experience certifying
Astra, we are confident the remaining certifications will be no problem.</p>
<p><span>l<span>  </span></span><b>I heard this
type of camera uses a laser. Is that safe?</b></p>
<p>Yes! The IR
projection module uses an infrared laser; however, the laser is very low power
(class 1, similar to a common laser pointer) and the laser light is passed
through a proprietary set of optics including a diffraction grating. This
causes the light to be spread out over a very large area, which means the light
is safe to the eye at any distance.</p>
<p>Just to make it
even safer, especially around children, we have added a proximity safety sensor
to all of our 3D cameras. The safety sensor is located next to the IR
projector. If it detects a face-sized object within 0.2m, it will shut off the
laser until the object goes away. Legally, we are well within the laser and
light safety requirements, but we went beyond those just to ensure everyone’s
safety.</p>
<p><span>l<span>  </span></span><b>Manufacturing
is complicated. What if there are supply problems or component shortages?</b></p>
<p>We have worked hard to
build our supply chain with reliable component vendors in multiple countries.
We also own our own production lines, which gives us complete control over the
production process and timeline and the quality and cost of our product. Even
so, there are unforeseeable risks, such as natural disasters or other events
that could disrupt the supply chain. To handle this, we have backup vendors
for every key component. Moreover, we own all of our reference designs and can
easily find new suppliers that can fulfill our needs.</p>
<p>l<span>  </span><b>There are lots
of patents out there. Do you have any legal risks?</b></p>
<p>We designed and developed all of our hardware
and software in-house and have several patents pending on our products. During
our three years of research and development that went into our 3D cameras, we
developed significant improvements upon the state-of-the-art of 3D sensing and
reconstruction. All of this means that we have created and own unique inventions
and intellectual property that are defensible to any challenge.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Highest Resolution</p></li>
<li><p>Longest Range </p></li>
<li><p>Lowest Latency</p></li>
<li><p>Exceptional Accuracy</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q: What does it mean to be committed to ""getting 3D right?""</b></p>
<p>A: Our sole focus on 3D computing
enables us to produce superior 3D hardware as well as a platform for creative
coders and pioneering developers to create amazing 3D experiences. The
company’s end-to-end investment in 3D technology includes developing a
proprietary microchip that can process depth data in real time, and
establishing its own manufacturing line to control cost and quality. No other
company has the same level of focus, commitment, and investment. From silicon to
the cloud, Orbbec’s end-to-end investment in 3D technology means we can offer
state-of-the-art technologies at prices that were unimaginable until now.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>: <b>Do you plan to bring these products to the consumer market?</b></p>
<p>A: We are currently focused on enabling developers to create
amazing 3D experiences. We are excited about the potential of bringing these
devices to the consumer market in the near future.</p>
<p><b>Q: When will
your products ship?</b></p>
<p>A: Supporters can expect to see
Astra 3D cameras ship immediately at the end of the campaign. Astra Pro 3D cameras will start shipping by the end of 2015. And we expect to be able to start shipping Persee in
early 2016. Our supporters will be updated regularly on status.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>: <b>I live outside of the US. Can I still contribute to the project and
be eligible for rewards?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes, please! We’re happy to
let anyone around the world experience our 3D technology and we support
international shipping. World-wide international shipping is very expensive, but we
decided to charge less than the actual shipping cost because we want to
encourage developers everywhere to use our products. International shipping is only $50 fixed worldwide (except
for Canada, which receives US shipping prices).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Q</b><b>: I want to purchase more than one Persee. Can I order more than
one at a time? If so, how do I do that?</b></p>
<p><span>A: Yes you can. A lot of people
are doing this; here’s how: 1) Select the Persee perk of your choice (Early
Bird, Insider, or Special Edition). 2) You’ll have the option of adding an
“additional gift.” Select the “custom” option and add an additional $199 for
each additional Persee plus additional shipping charges. In North America, you
will need to add $12 for each additional device (for instance, $199 + $12 for
one additional Persee). For international shipping, you need to add an extra
$15 for each additional device (for instance $199 + $15 for one additional
Persee). 3) For more information, please see the pricing chart below. And
please note that the bolded totals in the “Additional Devices(s) + Shipping”
column are what you will add to your “additional gift” section. 4) Finish your
transaction. 5) Your multiple Persee camera-computers
will be shipped to you together starting in February. Thanks!</span></p>

<p><b><b>Q: Does Orbbec have an SDK?</b></b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes! Orbbec understands that creatives and engineers need great tools to build great 3D experiences. The Orbbec Astra SDK enables developers to begin building new 3D experiences immediately with both the Orbbec Persee and the Orbbec Astra line of 3D cameras.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is the Orbbec Astra SDK cross-platform?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes. The SDK
supports Windows, OS X, Linux, and Android, as well as creative coding
frameworks including Processing, openFrameworks and Unity3D.</p>
<p><b>Q: What does the Orbbec Persee camera include?</b></p>
<p>A: Persee hardware includes a quad-core 1.8 GHz ARM CPU, 600 MHz GPU with OpenCL support, Wi-Fi
and high-speed Ethernet, 2 GB DDR3 RAM, and embedded 16 GB eMMC Flash.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Q: Do I need a mouse
and keyboard to use Persee?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>A: At this time, we are focusing on getting Persee in the
hands of developers. For developing and debugging apps, developers will need
to connect a mouse and keyboard into Persee using USB 2.0 or Bluetooth. We
expect that most applications will be developed to use the 3D camera as the
primary interface or data collection mechanism. When these devices are ready
for the consumer market, we expect that a mouse and keyboard won’t be necessary
for everyday use.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is
included in the SDK?</b></p>
<p>A: Our SDK is a work in progress
(which is another way of saying it’s still a preview version). Today, the
Orbbec Astra SDK includes: approachable yet sophisticated API, support for
Windows, OS X, Linux, and Android, <span>samples covering the most important aspects of
the SDK, robust hand tracking, support for Processing and Native C and
C++11 API.</span></p>
<p>Coming soon, the SDK will include
full-body skeleton tracking, extensive documentation, the ability to access
sensor data from multiple apps simultaneously, and support for additional languages including C# and Java, and additional frameworks, including openFrameworks, Unity 3D, and Cinder.</p>
<p><b>Q: How do
developers get the SDK?</b></p>
<p>A: The Orbbec Astra SDK is FREE
and can be downloaded at <a href=""https://orbbec3d.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">orbbec3d.com</a>. </p>

About Orbbec

Our mission is to create intelligent technologies for every human, everywhere.


For computers to be intelligent, they need more than the ability to make sense of the world around them—they need to see the world in 3D. And for intelligent computing to flourish, excellent 3D cameras that are affordably priced and universally available will be a necessity.


We
believe that in the future, it will be hard to remember a time when computers
didn’t have 3D cameras.

Orbbec has been working for the past three years to develop the best 3D cameras on the market as well as to create an entirely new category of 3D technology: a camera with a  built-in, fully functioning computer. Now we’re ready to share our new device with you. 
Orbbec Persee is the world’s first 3D camera-computer. It is a versatile, low-cost device that you can hold in your hand. It can plug into your TV or run without a display, and you can interact with it entirely through the built-in 3D camera.
We want artists, makers, creative coders, researchers, and pioneering developers to use Persee, give us feedback, and build 3D experiences that take intelligent computing to the next level.
We’re ready to start mass producing our devices and we’re looking for Indiegogo supporters to back our campaign to raise the funds we need to bring Persee to the world.



What people are saying about Orbbec

It’s clear that Orbbec ""gets it"" and really wants to support new forms of experimental interaction design and creative exploration. Their charming little Astra depth sensor is a tidy, cross-platform, easy-to-use (and USB bus-powered!) device that actually works with today's operating systems. And their Persee device is an altogether novel beast that will turn robotics on its ear and revolutionize how we track bodies in space. Clip it to the ceiling and you've got skeletons streaming over OSC! This is going to be hella fun.
Golan LevinDirector, Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative InquiryAssociate Professor of Electronic ArtCarnegie Mellon University



The Orbbec team’s dedication and expertise never ceases to amaze me. It’s no surprise they are now leading the creation of a new category of 3D devices with the introduction of the Orbbec Persee camera-computer. It is a long awaited and much needed catalyst for the development of creative, intelligent computing experiences. Reaching this level of 3D sophistication, at an affordable price, is groundbreaking.
George BarbastathisProfessor of Mechanical Engineering, MIT


My company has been building interactive production applications for 3D cameras for many years, but despite how promising some of the early technology has been; it still isn’t good enough. Orbbec is solving many of the core quality issues that have prevented gesture from becoming a norm by which we interface with computer systems. I believe them when they say they are committed to doing 3D right.
Tim HuckabyChairman, InterKnowlogy


It'sgreat to see a company that has been working with developers from day one. From the little things, like power over USB, having a built-in quarter-inch mount, to the really important things like being completely cross-platform, providing high quality depth data, and avoiding ambiguous legal restrictions, they've done everything right. This is the successor to the Kinect.


Kyle McDonaldInteractive Artist



This Orbbec device could lead to a new golden age of open source 3D hacking. It puts 3D scanning and body tracking within the reach of designers, students, artists, and creative coders of all types. I can't wait to use it in my own projects and see what the community does with it.


Greg BorensteinNYU ITP; MIT Media Lab;Futurist consultant for Fox’s ""Minority Report""Author, ""Making Things See: 3D Vision with Kinect, Processing, Arduino, and MakerBot""



Orbbec Persee and Astra cameras will be the standard for DepthKit volumetric filmmaking, and any creative project using the depth data aesthetic.


James GeorgeCo-founder of Specular.cc. Creator of DepthKit.



For museum installations, an integrated 3D camera-computer like Persee will lead to faster development, more stable installations, and happier clients. This is something I’ve been waiting for and look forward to using very soon!


Phoenix Perry                                                                Goldsmiths, University of London



At last, there's going to be a handy depth device out there made by 'one of us'. All the other hardware suppliers have distinctly opaque engineering departments. But Orbbec comes from people who truly understand open development from the inside out, with an engaged understanding of how to develop something like this for the community with an eye to the future of developing with depth devices.


Elliot WoodsArtist, Kimchi and Chips Studio



The cross-platform compatibility across operating systems, backward compatibility with OpenNI, and easy portability are solutions to the nagging problems for the creative depth-sensing community.


Ellen Pearlman                                                          Director and Curator,Volumetric Society of New York



This feels like the ""Impossible Project"" for depth cameras was made possible. I'm thrilled to see OpenNI-compatible, cross-platform hardware back on the market. And anybody who's played with a Raspberry Pi and PiCam can imagine the possibilities offered by a fully-programmable standalone version.


Nick Fox-GiegAnimator



What I love about Orbbec is they are thinking about the problems they are solving with a long term view. Sure, they are developing amazing 3D cameras, yet they’re doing a bunch more than that. They have also designed their own 3D chip, are developing an SDK, and  have their own manufacturing line so they can control cost and ensure device availability. Orbbec understands that vision based tech isn’t just about the hardware, it’s about the whole ecosystem and the systems that power the hardware.

Risks and challenges

Every project involves risk and encounters challenges. We’ve done our best to minimize the risks. Here’s a timeline of everything we’ve done so far to make sure these products are a success:






l  Does the
product work yet?
Yes! We already have a
working product. We’ve been developing this technology for three years with an
incredibly talented and smart team. Our 3D sensor is ready for developers, and
in fact some of our early partners have already been testing and using the sensors
for several months. 
l  Can you
actually mass-produce these? Can you ship on time?
Yes! We have already
invested a great deal into establishing manufacturing lines dedicated to mass
producing our building our sensors. That’s why we’re ready to ship the Astra
cameras immediately after the campaign ends. The Astra Pro
and Persee devices need a little more time to prepare for their manufacturing,
but we are confident that we can produce and ship those products to our
Indiegogo backers on schedule.
l  Are your
products certified for sale?
Yes! The Astra
camera already has approval from FCC, CE, IC, and CB, and is ready to ship
world-wide.

                                             

The cameras
inside Astra Pro and Persee are mostly the same components as in Astra, and the
individual components that make up the computer in Persee have already passed
certifications when used in other products. With our experience certifying
Astra, we are confident the remaining certifications will be no problem.
l  I heard this
type of camera uses a laser. Is that safe?
Yes! The IR
projection module uses an infrared laser; however, the laser is very low power
(class 1, similar to a common laser pointer) and the laser light is passed
through a proprietary set of optics including a diffraction grating. This
causes the light to be spread out over a very large area, which means the light
is safe to the eye at any distance.
Just to make it
even safer, especially around children, we have added a proximity safety sensor
to all of our 3D cameras. The safety sensor is located next to the IR
projector. If it detects a face-sized object within 0.2m, it will shut off the
laser until the object goes away. Legally, we are well within the laser and
light safety requirements, but we went beyond those just to ensure everyone’s
safety.
l  Manufacturing
is complicated. What if there are supply problems or component shortages?
We have worked hard to
build our supply chain with reliable component vendors in multiple countries.
We also own our own production lines, which gives us complete control over the
production process and timeline and the quality and cost of our product. Even
so, there are unforeseeable risks, such as natural disasters or other events
that could disrupt the supply chain. To handle this, we have backup vendors
for every key component. Moreover, we own all of our reference designs and can
easily find new suppliers that can fulfill our needs.
l  There are lots
of patents out there. Do you have any legal risks?
We designed and developed all of our hardware
and software in-house and have several patents pending on our products. During
our three years of research and development that went into our 3D cameras, we
developed significant improvements upon the state-of-the-art of 3D sensing and
reconstruction. All of this means that we have created and own unique inventions
and intellectual property that are defensible to any challenge.

Q: I want to purchase a Persee as well as an
Astra/Astra Pro. Can I order both at once? If so, how do I do that?
A:  Yes you can. A lot of
people are doing this; here’s how: 1) Select the Persee perk of your choice
(Early Bird, Insider, or Special Edition). 2) You’ll have the option of
adding an “additional gift.” Select the “custom” option and add an additional
$99 for each additional Astra Early Bird plus additional shipping charges.
Note: In North America, you will need to add $12 for each additional device
(for instance, $99 + $12 for one additional Astra). If you are an international
customer and want to
save on shipping costs, we can ship both devices together internationally
when Persee is ready next year and you will only pay $15 in shipping fees for
each additional device (for instance, $99 + $15 for one Astra camera). If you
don’t want to wait to get your Astra camera, which will be ready a few months
ahead of Persee, they can be shipped separately. International separate
shipping will cost an additional $50 per device (for instance, $99 + $50
for one Astra). 3)
Finish your transaction. 4) Someone on our fulfillment team will contact you to find out if you want an Astra or and
Astra Pro 3D camera. 5) You products will be shipped to you. Thanks!
Q: Does Orbbec have an SDK?
A: Yes! Orbbec understands that creatives and engineers need great tools to build great 3D experiences. The Orbbec Astra SDK enables developers to begin building new 3D experiences immediately with both the Orbbec Persee and the Orbbec Astra line of 3D cameras.
Q: Is the Orbbec Astra SDK cross-platform?
A: Yes. The SDK
supports Windows, OS X, Linux, and Android, as well as creative coding
frameworks including Processing, openFrameworks and Unity3D.
Q: What does the Orbbec Persee camera include?
A: Persee hardware includes a quad-core 1.8 GHz ARM CPU, 600 MHz GPU with OpenCL support, Wi-Fi
and high-speed Ethernet, 2 GB DDR3 RAM, and embedded 16 GB eMMC Flash.


Q: Do I need a mouse
and keyboard to use Persee?

A: At this time, we are focusing on getting Persee in the
hands of developers. For developing and debugging apps, developers will need
to connect a mouse and keyboard into Persee using USB 2.0 or Bluetooth. We
expect that most applications will be developed to use the 3D camera as the
primary interface or data collection mechanism. When these devices are ready
for the consumer market, we expect that a mouse and keyboard won’t be necessary
for everyday use.
Q: What is
included in the SDK?
A: Our SDK is a work in progress
(which is another way of saying it’s still a preview version). Today, the
Orbbec Astra SDK includes: approachable yet sophisticated API, support for
Windows, OS X, Linux, and Android, samples covering the most important aspects of
the SDK, robust hand tracking, support for Processing and Native C and
C++11 API.

</div></div>","ArduShield it is most universal development shield for most popular Arduino boards like a Arduino UNO R3, Mini, Pro Mini V5, Nano V3, MicroR3, Leonardo, Yun, Zero, Galileo Gen2 and many other derivative boards created by great community of people.
 
  Idea for ArduShield was born out of the problem that hit several Arduino fans.First we found that we had many shields that fit only to Arduino UNO, but they don’t fit to Arduino Mini, Pro Mini, Nano and other type of smaller Arduino board. Smaller Arduino boards are much more cost effective then Arduino UNO, and we want to use them to. Example of Ethernet shield drive by Arduino Micro.  Example of 2×16 LED display shield drive by Arduino Pro Mini.
 
 

Second thing what most bother us over time, was when we have to start one more time re-wiring Arduino and bread board because of some small mistake which cannot be find. Idea was to shrink down amount of the cable between Arduino UNO and Bread Board minimum by half. 
 
 
 Great things about ArduShield is that you can have access for all pins of Arduino on bread board instantly.  

Another useful thing about ArduShield is that you can have power supply to your bread board.  You can also use VCC or GND signal separately if you want just by cutting narrow trace on BR1 or BR2. If you want to go back with this connection just place a drop of tin between cuted trace.  

ArduShield can be use like a programing tool for Arduino mini and Arduino Pro Mini. We know that both of this board require external programmer.
Now if you have Arduino UNO board you can connect Arduino Mini or Arduino Pro Mini instantly to ArduShield and play with them via Arduino IDE.

  Not all of the time you need to use Arduino Uno and Atmega32 in your project. Therefore we also bring socket on ArduShield for ATTiny25/45/85 family. Like it is in case of Arduino Mini and Arduino Pro Mini, ATTiny85 can be programmed via Arduino Uno and Arduino IDE. 
 
 In addition ATTiny85 received names of the pins (P0...P5) on ArduShield to play with them more easy. 

 

Now you will get access for all of the pins Arduino Mini and Pro Mini on bread board.Till now when you need to use pins A4, A5, A6, A7 with Arduino Mini there where make short cut with pin 8 and 9 on bread board.
With Arduino Pro Mini pins were not place in the 0.1inch (2.54mm) raster. They had this weird spacing.  Now this changed with ArduShield.
 
 
ArduShield provide access for all 4 holes from each side of bread board. 
Comparing with Arduino Micro and Nano we have access for 2 and 3 pins after assembly PCB on bread board.  Access for 4 holes on each side give us high flexibility during design. 

 
 

The realy nice thing about this shield is that you can develope even 2 prototype at the one time on one breadboard, without the need to disconnect everything. How it is frustrated when you need to jump shortly to another prototype and check some new idea!
Now this is easy and simple.
Just flip side of the ArduShield on bread board and you are ready to go with your second idea!

You can also use ArduShield with derivatives boards. Please check their compatibility with original Arduino boards before use.
 
At this moment we are planing 3 stretch goals valid till end of campaing October 11, 2016

We achieve this by donating a percentage of our earnings to health and education projects in third world nations. We are proud to say that on the 18th of May, 2018 we took our community efforts one step further by carrying out a medical outreach in Opebi, Ikeja community in South-Western Nigeria. We gave out over 200 insecticide-treated mosquito nets, tested residents of this slum community for malaria and general health, and gave out medication. We know that this does not amount to world domination but we are keen to do as much as we can within communities that have the needs.When we first launched on Indiegogo, we pledged a portion of our earnings to rehabilitating a school in Ago-Iwoye, Nigeria. We are proud to say that not only did we renovate the school, but also we donated desks, chairs, books, and other materials to students in that school. We also took it one step further and provided full scholarships to over sixty (60) students in that school.Check out the update section of the campaign to Learn More. SKEPTICAL ABOUT INDIEGOGO?We’ve successful crowdfunded and delivered TWICE to thousands of backers.

One Universal Solution All devices with Power Delivery connect using a USB-C cable. Power can flow in either direction so it’s possible to share power between devices, even from your phone to a friend’s phone. USB-C connectors are small, smart, and capable of transmitting large amounts of power. You can safely use the same cable to charge your smartphone, your tablet and your laptop – no separate power brick for your laptop is required. Is it safe? USB-C — the connector used in USB Power Delivery is a cutting-edge technology. It has been designed hand-in-hand with Power Delivery, to handle these new high levels of power. Explore the benefits of USB-C cables at our USB-C Resource Center. Other “fast charging” products may use older connectors.

15 minutes to landing 
SIM card needs to be replaced 
BUT - it's nowhere to be found 
SD and SIM cards went from the size of a credit card to being even smaller than a dime. To complicate things further, we now need a sharp pin to access the SIM tray each time we want to swap the SIM card.  A Travel Essential Don't get us wrong, we're loving all the innovation. Though we do end up losing those tiny nano SIMs and SD cards all the time. This problem doesn't just cost money (especially when travelling away from home), but lot's of inconvenience and miscommunication.  The famous SIM card search We all tuck SD and SIM cards into our wallets, cardholders and/or bags. But when we need them most, we can't ever find them. They can easily fall out of wallets and get in lost in big handbags. Moreover, we also forget to pack the SIM tray ejector pin and need to borrow one from someone. SD cards contain highly sensitive data, including personal photos, videos, and documents - losing one is not an option. Exposure to dirt can easily damage and/or corrupt your valuable personal data. So when travelling abroad, we end up spending an obscene amount of money on roaming until we manage to purchase a new/replacement SIM card, costing at least 10-15 euros. Fiddle no more. TravelPass has you covered.  The Ultimate Card for CardsTravelPass conveniently and safely stores:
International SIM Cards of ALL sizes (Standard, Micro, Nano) 

Micro SD Card for all your media 

SIM Tray Ejector Pin  
Handy Ruler ( 2 inches / 5 cm )

With a simple movement the mechanism is charged with kinetic energy which is transmitted to the micro generators. The charging module is 5V USB that charges all the devices that support the standard USB. The intensity of electric current is up to 2200 mA and this offers a faster charge, by using the new tehnology ""Quick Charge 2.0"".</b><p>For the people that are less technical, Jiffy with the 2200mA can simultaneously charge 6 smart phones with 4” screens that are navigating the internet through Wi-Fi, or 4 smart phones that are navigating the internet through 3G. </p><p><b>Technical info about the prototype:</b></p><p>Behind the micro generator is mounted a controller that has the function of continuously recovering the current and 5V voltage stabilization.

Pull it out when your other devices need saving in any emergency.We are living in the time of technology that has been developing more and faster than ever. Technology has become essential in today’s world. Our lives have become closely linked to mobile electronic devices, because they give us freedom of communication.Jiffy helps your devices when they run out of juice.When the battery runs out devices and gadgets become useless pieces of plastic and metal. They become unusable.Jiffy is an eco-charger that truly offers freedom and unlimited independence when it comes to charging your mobile devices and gadgets.That’s it! You are completely independent of any power supply, electric network, or wall outlet.  Jiffy is an eco-charger that has a priceless advantage both in everyday life and especially when travelling and going on new adventures even to the ends of the world.THE IDEAL SITUATION- to maintain a last call, an emergency call when you are in a critical situation, to send a last text, or study a map with GPS in case you get lost and can’t find sources to charge your device nearby.TOTAL ENERGY INDEPENDENCE- charge devices and gadgets at any time, any place and without taking in to consideration the weather, or temperature outside.Imagine a scenario of being lost in the woods, in the desert, or in a jungle. Your phones battery will be assured only by Jiffy!PRIORITY- compared to other methods of charging gadgets, Jiffy doesn’t need gas balloons with chemical reactions as other chargers. You can use it at night, in the shade, in thick forests unlike solar chargers. Jiffy also doesn’t need wind, or water currents.IMPORTANT-No traditional electricity, no air pollution, and you don’t need to look for a power outlet. In this way you don’t need to worry about where you will charge your mobile phone, camera, Bluetooth headset, or any other devices that can be charged through USB.Charge while on any type of transportation: train, ship, bus, or even wagon. You can rest assured and camp as much as you want, do extreme mountain sports, go hiking, or rock climbing without worrying that your camera, or smart phone will be without battery and you will remain without communication.We all know how problematic it is to find an electrical power outlet when going on longer trips. Also we know situations when electricity shuts off at home because of powerful rain, wind, or other natural phenomena that cause damage to power grids. You will be able to access the internet, radio, or other news portals in times of danger and emergency.Thanks to the USB attachment with LED light, Jiffy can be used as a light source. It does not need batteries and can be used at any time when there are blackouts and electricity and light are most needed. It is perfect to have a Jiffy handy in your emergency kit.MULTI USB- the cable is perfect to charge any gadget at any time. Charge your devices and gadgets, or help a friend that needs help, but needs a different kind of cable.How does Jiffy work? Jiffy represents a USB charger that mechanically produces electricity without eliminating toxic substances into the atmosphere. Electricity production is carried out by a three phase asynchronous micro generator with very high productivity, which is driven by a complex mechanical watch. With a simple movement the mechanism is charged with kinetic energy which is transmitted to the micro generators. The charging module is 5V USB that charges all the devices that support the standard USB. The intensity of electric current is up to 2200 mA and this offers a faster charge, by using the new tehnology ""Quick Charge 2.0"".For the people that are less technical, Jiffy with the 2200mA can simultaneously charge 6 smart phones with 4” screens that are navigating the internet through Wi-Fi, or 4 smart phones that are navigating the internet through 3G. Technical info about the prototype:Behind the micro generator is mounted a controller that has the function of continuously recovering the current and 5V voltage stabilization. Also an electrolytic capacitor which has the function of a micro accumulator is connected in the scheme to remove the current fluctuations produced by mechanical processes under the influence of kinetic energy.Electrical schemeWe documented our work process and wanted to share with you the important stepsThanks for making it all the way down here to meet team Jiffy!What we intend to do after the campaign is finished?After the Indiegogo campaign is finished we will start work on Jiffy immediately because we know that time is the biggest enemy for a start up. We know that we will encounter obstacles along the way, but we are ready to face them and if everything goes as planned we will deliver Jiffy within the timeline that we estimated. We hope that Jiffy is just the first of many devices that we work on. For us this is hopefully going to be a successful campaign that will turn into a small business and generate enough income to give us the possibility to work on bigger projects. It would be great to work on other projects that will bring solutions to problems like reusable energy, eco friendly energy, global warming etc. These are the problems that bother us and we hope that with your help we will be able to start attending to them.TIMELINEPerks",19.0,0,"12 Campaigns

access. She/he instaling the TouchWi app
and using it registering to TouchWi. When registration is successful you will
get a login and password. Using it you can login to webpage which allows to you
send wireless touches. Or if you are also using a smartphone with internet you
can install TouchWi app which allows you to send wireless touches. To send
wireless touch is very simple. If you are using app, you open it and you will see
a touch zones which can be activated. Touch zones – the zones where your lover
can feel your touch. How long you push on it, it will be wireless touch feel time. If you
can‘t or don‘t want to use a smartphone you can send touch via TouchWi webpage.

<h2>
Welcome to Uber Hates Tips</h2>
<p>Uber Hates Tips is a simple way for you to tip your Uber driver anonymously using your phone. Your driver will know you tipped, but never how much you tipped. Did we mention it's free?</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Uber and tips. The saga.</strong></h3>
<p>If you're an Uber driver, you know that this has been a problem from day one. Uber told everyone that tips were included in the Uber fare -- even though they weren't -- and you risked getting ""deactivated"" if you even discussed tipping with your passengers.</p>
<p>If you're an Uber passenger, you believed Uber when they told you that tips were included. And then your Uber rating began sinking and you found it harder and harder to get rides. ""What did I do?,"" you thought. ""I never make my driver wait. I'm pleasant and cheerful. I take regular showers. Why did my driver down-rate me?""</p>
<p>Now you know that it isn't that your driver down-rated you for being a bad passenger. It's that your driver up-rated other passengers to thank them for tipping. So by trying to remove tipping from the equation, Uber has managed to make it even more uncomfortable for everyone concerned.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>But Uber <i>hates</i> tips. Why is this OK now?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Because of a recent court case, Uber has agreed to a settlement that will allow Uber drivers to accept tips from passengers and even put signs in their cars reminding passengers that tips are appreciated. (We should note here that the court case itself still has a little way to go before the settlement becomes final.)</p>
<p>So it looks like Uber drivers can now expect to earn tips like everyone else. This solves a problem -- sort of, Uber still refuses to put a tip line in its app -- for you Uber drivers but it just creates one for passengers. Passengers regularly say that one of the things they liked best about Uber was not having to worry about tipping. Surveys show that this is not because they are cheap, but because they do not want to stress about being judged on their tips. They also show that many Uber passengers hate tipping in cash because they often carry only credit cards and their phone. This goes double for business passengers who are happy to tip but need receipts so they can be reimbursed.</p>
<p>We at Uber Hates Tips feel everyone's pain, which is why we worked out a solution: a simple way for people to tip their drivers anonymously using their phones. When someone tips, the driver will immediately get a message on her phone letting her know that she's gotten a tip but not for how much or from whom. We think this is the best of both worlds. The driver gets a tip. The passenger gets a big smile and a ""Thank you!"". And, best of all, nobody gets any stress.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>How does it work?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>As simply as we could make it. Uber drivers will have a sign with a QR code on it in their cars. Each QR code is unique to that driver. The app scans the QR code, you enter the amount you want to tip in the little box and press send. That's all you have to do.</p>
<p>Of course, that's only the beginning of the process. The driver still has to react with happy surprise when he sees that a Good Friend has sent him a tip and then thank you profusely, not only for tipping, but for helping build the system that made his tip possible. So there is a little work involved.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>How will drivers get their QR codes?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>When they sign up for their account -- signing up is free, of course -- the system will generate a unique QR code for them that they can download as a pdf and then print out or display on a tablet in their cars.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>What is this about custom titles?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>If you contribute $10 or more to this campaign, you'll receive a special title that will be included in the message sent to your driver when you tip. This will let the driver know that you aren't just a passenger, you're one of the handful of truly special people that made it possible for him to earn a decent living and put kale on the table. Children will be named after you. Though why someone would want to name their child ""BFF"" is a mystery to us.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Will people have to have the app to use it?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Sounds like a trick question, doesn't it? You will be surprised to learn that the answer is ""No."" If your driver has a sign in his car with his personal QR code on it, you will still be able to use it to tip your driver, even if you don't have the app.</p>
<p>If you don't have the app and you scan the driver's sign, you will be taken to a special form linked specifically to that driver that will allow you to enter your credit card information and a tip. You'll also be encouraged to download the app because, really, why would you want to do that twice? Wouldn't it be much better just to enter a tip and push send?</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Is this going to be safe and secure?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Absolutely. We are not actually touching your credit card information or the driver's banking information ourselves. All of that is stored with Braintree, who will also be doing all the financial processing.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p><h3><strong>So what, exactly, are you funding with this campaign?</strong></h3><p></p>
<p>The first 20K, our funding target, will allow us to create a very basic Android app and a simple back-end that will allow drivers to register and get their unique QR codes. If we raise additional funds through this campaign, we have a long list of additions and improvements we will be making.</p>
<p>Our first priority will be an iPhone version of the app, which will cost another 20K. We very much hope the community will be excited enough about this project to help us reach this goal since that will allow our solution to reach more than 98% of Uber passengers.</p>
<p>After creating an iPhone app, there are a number of improvements and features that could and should be added to make the app and the back-end more functional and user friendly. These include allowing drivers to generate customizable physical signs that display their QR code and that can then be shipped to them for use in their cars, an improved user interface that will allow percentage tipping, card scanning, automatic fare calculation and a host of other features.</p>
<p>Some of these stretch goals would not be implemented in Version 1.0. Rather, they would be included in updates. Our primary goal is to get a stable, functional tool in the hands of Uber passengers they can use to tip their drivers. The bells and whistles will catch up soon enough but they can't be allowed to delay the project.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Does this cost anything?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>We made it as free as we possibly could. First, it's 100% free to download. It's 100% free to sign up, both for drivers and for passengers. It's 100% free for drivers to download their personal QR code.</p>
<p>When drivers actually receive tips on the system, there is going to be a small amount deducted from each tip. These are mostly fees charged by Braintree. Initially, 4.95% + $0.30 will need to be deducted from each tip that a driver receives.</p>
<p>But here's the interesting part. If we can process a certain amount of tips through this system every month, we can negotiate a lower processing fee with Braintree. The more money we are able to process, the lower the fees. So if the community pulls together and makes this work, i.e., if drivers put small signs with their QR codes in their cars, we can drive these charges down for everyone. This really is a community effort.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Are you really going to call this app Uber Hates Tips?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>We'd like to, but, to be honest, probably not. We've got some more normal ideas for a name but if you think you've got a good one, please suggest it. We'd have a contest to name the app, but we know you'd all vote for Appy McAppface and we're not going there.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Technically, there aren't any serious risks or challenges at all. All the functions we are implementing are straightforward. We are using Braintree for all the financial transactions as well as for secure storage of all sensitive financial information. We have already identified a design team to handle the actual coding.</p>
<p>To be honest, the only real risk in this project is, well, you. Not you personally, of course, we mean the community of Uber passengers and drivers. If the community wants this to work, it will absolutely work. But we all have to do our part by downloading the app -- which will be free, of course -- and, if you're a driver, by displaying your QR code in your car.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>How Can I help?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong></strong>First, of course, contribute! This is really a group effort.</p>
<p>But more importantly, participate! If you are a driver, sign up and put your QR code in your car. Get other drivers to put their QR code in their cars, too. Tell people about this campaign. Tweet about it. Write about it on Facebook. Tell your friends. This is basically free money, people! Your friends are gonna be mad at you if you don't tell them about it!</p>
<p>If you are a passenger, download the app. Tell your friends, too. When you take an Uber, be sure and brag to your friends that you know all about the sign in the car and that you were one of the people who helped create it.</p>
<p>Oh, and there is one other thing you can do: <a href=""https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=733804553532014594"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Follow us on Twitter!</a></p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h2><strong>Campaign Update: Great News!</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Our campaign has generated a lot of interest in some very interesting places!</p>
<p>As we now have actual investors excited to back our project, it will no longer be necessary to rely on crowd funding to make this project a reality. After discussing it, we all feel that the right thing to do is to put all of our contributors first, thank them for their support and refund their contributions.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong></p>
<p>We will still be providing our contributors with the perks they were promised as our way of thanking them for standing in our corner. You all believe in this as much as we do and that means a lot to us.</p>
<p>So watch for the public rollout of the app which should be sometime in the next 90 days . . . and you can still say, ""I did that!"" because you did. None of this would have been possible without your enthusiasm and support</p>
<p>Thanks Again!</p>

The first 20K, our funding target, will allow us to create a very basic Android app and a simple back-end that will allow drivers to register and get their unique QR codes. If we raise additional funds through this campaign, we have a long list of additions and improvements we will be making.
Our first priority will be an iPhone version of the app, which will cost another 20K. We very much hope the community will be excited enough about this project to help us reach this goal since that will allow our solution to reach more than 98% of Uber passengers.
After creating an iPhone app, there are a number of improvements and features that could and should be added to make the app and the back-end more functional and user friendly. These include allowing drivers to generate customizable physical signs that display their QR code and that can then be shipped to them for use in their cars, an improved user interface that will allow percentage tipping, card scanning, automatic fare calculation and a host of other features.
Some of these stretch goals would not be implemented in Version 1.0. Rather, they would be included in updates. Our primary goal is to get a stable, functional tool in the hands of Uber passengers they can use to tip their drivers. The bells and whistles will catch up soon enough but they can't be allowed to delay the project.

Does this cost anything?

We made it as free as we possibly could. First, it's 100% free to download. It's 100% free to sign up, both for drivers and for passengers. It's 100% free for drivers to download their personal QR code.
When drivers actually receive tips on the system, there is going to be a small amount deducted from each tip. These are mostly fees charged by Braintree. Initially, 4.95% + $0.30 will need to be deducted from each tip that a driver receives.
But here's the interesting part. If we can process a certain amount of tips through this system every month, we can negotiate a lower processing fee with Braintree. The more money we are able to process, the lower the fees. So if the community pulls together and makes this work, i.e., if drivers put small signs with their QR codes in their cars, we can drive these charges down for everyone. This really is a community effort.

Are you really going to call this app Uber Hates Tips?

We'd like to, but, to be honest, probably not. We've got some more normal ideas for a name but if you think you've got a good one, please suggest it. We'd have a contest to name the app, but we know you'd all vote for Appy McAppface and we're not going there.

Risks and Challenges

Technically, there aren't any serious risks or challenges at all. All the functions we are implementing are straightforward. We are using Braintree for all the financial transactions as well as for secure storage of all sensitive financial information. We have already identified a design team to handle the actual coding.
To be honest, the only real risk in this project is, well, you. Not you personally, of course, we mean the community of Uber passengers and drivers. If the community wants this to work, it will absolutely work. But we all have to do our part by downloading the app -- which will be free, of course -- and, if you're a driver, by displaying your QR code in your car.

How Can I help?

First, of course, contribute! This is really a group effort.
But more importantly, participate! If you are a driver, sign up and put your QR code in your car. Get other drivers to put their QR code in their cars, too. Tell people about this campaign. Tweet about it. Write about it on Facebook. Tell your friends. This is basically free money, people! Your friends are gonna be mad at you if you don't tell them about it!
If you are a passenger, download the app. Tell your friends, too. When you take an Uber, be sure and brag to your friends that you know all about the sign in the car and that you were one of the people who helped create it.
Oh, and there is one other thing you can do: Follow us on Twitter!


Campaign Update: Great News!

Our campaign has generated a lot of interest in some very interesting places!
As we now have actual investors excited to back our project, it will no longer be necessary to rely on crowd funding to make this project a reality. After discussing it, we all feel that the right thing to do is to put all of our contributors first, thank them for their support and refund their contributions.
BUT
We will still be providing our contributors with the perks they were promised as our way of thanking them for standing in our corner. You all believe in this as much as we do and that means a lot to us.
So watch for the public rollout of the app which should be sometime in the next 90 days . . . and you can still say, ""I did that!"" because you did. None of this would have been possible without your enthusiasm and support
Thanks Again!

Until now, the industry has only provided complicated solutions that require the ""switchboard"" approach in order to be able to control objects from a ""Smartphone"" (e.g. home Wifi router, home automation switchboard).</p>
<p>We are now proud to introduce the ""ON:NOT:ON"" power strip, featuring individual control of each of its sockets via the ""Smartphone"". FULLY PLUG'N'PLAY</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/IzR1r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>No APP needed – No Wifi router needed – No computer needed– No home automation switchboard needed.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<h3>It's very simple:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Users can connect any appliance* that they want to control to the power strip.</li>
<li>[ First time only] The user opens the browser's ""Smartphone"", select the WiFi signal generated by the power strip and introduce the password provided. This operation is automatic, but must be performed at least once.</li>
<li>A window will pop up on the browser displaying the 4 buttons list to control each of the 4 power strip sockets and a few further features.  From that moment, the Smartphone has become a remote control and the window will remain always open. It can be minimised and reopened at any time.</li>
</ul><p> [ Colour coded buttons for On/ Off check ]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since the control is run from the Smartphone´s browser, there is no need for any additional software installation which makes it fully compatible with Android and iPhone. <strong>It is unbeatably simple, just....... connect ......and use. It´s that simple</strong></p>
<h2>Applications;</h2>
<ul>
<li>From the comfort of your sofa, you will be able to turn on and off any type of lights, fans, air conditioning*, turn the children's TV off at a certain time.</li>
<li>Switch on and off your coffee maker*, toaster*</li>
<li>Use it as a strong anti-theft measure simulating the presence of people at home. The power strip can activate its sockets randomly according to the pattern selected, e.g.:</li>
</ul><p>                Turn on and off different lights at random.</p>

Pas besoin de descendre une APP – Pas besoin de router Wifi – Pas besoin d’ordinateur – Pas besoin de centrale de domotique.
 
Comment ça fonctionne ?
Le fonctionnement est très simple :

L’utilisateur connecte à la multiprise les appareils* qu’il désire contrôler.
[ Seulement une fois ] L’utilisateur ouvre le navigateur de son « Smartphone », sélectionne le signal Wifi généré par la multiprise et introduit le mot de passe fourni. Cette opération est automatique mais doit se réaliser au moins une fois.
Il apparaît une fenêtre dans le navigateur avec la liste des 4 boutons pour contrôler individuellement chacune des 4 sorties de la multiprise ainsi que quelques fonctions supplémentaires. A partir de cet instant, le Smartphone vient de se convertir en une télécommande à distance . La fenêtre avec les boutons peut rester ouverte ou être réduite pour pouvoir l’utiliser à n’importe quel moment.
[ Vérification de « allumer/éteindre » grâce au changement de couleurs des boutons ]
Étant donné que le contrôle se fait depuis le navigateur du Smartphone il n’est pas nécessaire d’installer une application. Cela permet la compatibilité totale avec Android et Iphone en plus d’une simplicité déconcertante en effet…..on le connecte……et on l’utilise. C’est aussi simple que ça !
 
Applications ;

Depuis le sofa de votre salon vous pourrez allumer/éteindre tout types de lumières, ventilateurs, air conditionné*, éteindre la télévision a certaines heures (enfants).
Allumer/éteindre cafetières*, grille-pain*
Puissante mesure anti-vol grâce à la fonction du simulateur de présence dans votre maison ; la multiprise peut activer de façon aléatoire ses sorties et suivant un modèle choisis par l’utilisateur comme cela pourrait être ;
                 Différentes lumières qui s’enclenchent de façon aléatoire.
                 Que la radio s’enclenche avec un volume déterminé.
                 …Et pourquoi pas un peu de bruit avec un petit aspirateur*

Jeux de lumières avec machine à fumée et stroboscope contrôlé par le Smartphone.
 * Ver puissance maximum acceptée (1100W @ 110VAC, 2200W @ 220VAC)
 
¿ Que faire si j’ai besoin de plus de prises ou si je veux contrôler un appareil en dehors de la maison ?
La multiprise est totalement compatible avec les éléments X10 de domotique.
 
Si vous voulez contrôler à distance une pompe de mini-piscine, le portail de la maison, il suffit d’acheter un module « X10 » de domotique et de le brancher à une prise de la maison ou du garage afin de contrôler l’appareil et cela en dehors de la couverture Wifi de la multiprise.

Ces éléments seront contrôlés grâce aux boutons supplémentaires qui apparaissent dans le navigateur du Smartphone pour allumer/éteindre les dispositifs X10.

IL N’EST DONC PAS NÉCESSAIRE DE RÉALISER UNE INSTALLATION ÉLECTRIQUE. En effet, la multiprise ON:NOT:ON  se communique avec les éléments X10 à travers du propre réseau électrique !
En tenant compte qu’il est possible de rajouter jusqu’à 256 modules X10 vous disposez donc d’un système de domotique sans installation de centrale et tout cela contrôlé par le Smartphone et cela à un prix très bas.
Pas besoin de dire à ce stade que celui qui dispose d’un routeur Wifi à la maison pourrait disposer de toutes les fonctions de la multiprise depuis n’importe quelle partie du monde (Configuration du routeur nécessaire et dépend du service internet)
Chacune des fonctions du ON:NOT:ON décrite précédemment a été testée pendants plusieurs mois et il est venu le moment de passer à la production.
J’ai besoin de votre aide a travers de IndieGoGo pour arriver à un minimum de 500 pièces qui est la quantité minimum pour que le projet soit viable au niveau de production.
(Multiprise disponible pour les prises de U.S./UK/Europe)
Même si dans le vidéo apparaît un prototype, le projet est basé sous la plateforme Arduino et est totalement OPEN SOURCE, il peut être modifié et reprogrammé au goût de chacun. En fait nous sommes anxieux  de connaître les améliorations qu’il est possible d’apporter à la multiprise. Nous sommes à disposition pour n’importe question, il suffit de nous envoyer un message. Nous serons enchantés de répondre.
Nous avons aussi besoin de votre aide à travers de IndieGoGo pour nous permettre de développer dans le futur l’une ou l’autre application pour Smartphone pour rajouter des fonctions à la multiprise et pour l’actualiser.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

We took a user-center designed approach and spent hours researching, prototyping, and collecting data.  We worked closely with Cite de L'Object Connecte in Angers, France to make our first working prototypes.Our design and prototypes have been tested and proved. Now, we're about to begin the Design for Manufacturing process with our manufacturers to get to our first production run. We're perfecting the last details to bring Pause to you.We are passionate about reminding people of nature and of not being stuck in a box on a screen. It's why we decided to make Pause out of sustainable wood. It's a reminder to be present, to be in the now, to appreciate what's in front of you and what you're feeling. It's a reminder to breathe.     Hicham & Julian Pause was created by Hicham Lahmamsi and Julian Nachtigal, who met at Imagination Machine, a Nantes, France-based accelerator, in 2017. They were deeply interested in the challenge and problem of smartphone dependence and use. It was an experience they both knew personally. It became clear that the way to disconnect more was by creating a physical ritual and habit that encouraged less phone and more life.Pause was built to create phone free spaces and give you more presence by loosening the grip that our smartphones have on us. Our experience and partners make us feel confident we will deliver you a high-quality product.  Where do we ship? We ship worldwide. All our prices include taxes, shipping is added when you checkout. When do we start shipping? We plan to ship the product in March 2019. Why so long? Most crowdfunding campaigns under-deliver on delivery timelines and we want to double and triple check our production level prototypes before our first run. We will keep you updated on our progress and the expected delivery date of your Pause wireless charger(s). Why order now? By backing us now, you'll get to own one of the first every Pause chargers and get exclusive access to special pricing, laser-engraving, and be valuable early adopters for Pause. You'll also be able to provide incredibly valuable feedback that will shape the future of Pause.  Thank you to everyone who has helped us on our journey over the last year. Pause has been a very humbling experience and we wouldn't be here without you. We're grateful for the time you spent with us, the knowledge and feedback you shared with us, and for just giving us a chance. A big thanks goes out to our partners: Imagination Machine, Cite de l'Objet Connecte Angers, Matiere Noire, LinetArt, MStream, and Hutisa. A special thanks goes out to you, our backers who believe in Pause and want to create a world with less phone and more life.   We know there are huge challenges with hardware when it comes to manufacturing, production, and shipping. It is why we have allotted plenty of buffer in our planning so we can deliver on the estimated delivery date. Considering all the factors involved, it is possible that we may run into delays. While it is our first go around with hardware, we have spoken with many successful crowdfunding entrepreneurs and hardware manufacturers and feel that our estimates are realistic. We want to ensure your experience with Pause is the best one possible and will keep you updated along the way.Questions about this project?

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>My husband and I are passionate about the outdoors and travel. Tony is a 200 nights a year business traveler and product development specialist. I am an artist and outdoor enthusiast that frequently finds my self miles from an outlet but still needing to keep my technology powered up.  Earlier this year we launched No Outlet No Problem power banks that we successfully funded on an alternative crowd funding site and have received rave reviews from our community of backers and customers with a 97.4% satisfaction rating from the survey we sent out!</p>
<p>(you can visit our website at <a href=""http://www.nooutletnoproblem.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nooutletnoproblem.com</a>).</p>
<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>There are many different versions of the portable solar panel on the market, and we aren't claiming to have invented the underlying technology, only to have improved it while creating a nexus of price and performance that puts the technology within reach of the back-country adventurer, remote worker and preparedness community. We have also optimized the form to protect the devices you are charging from direct sun exposure (a major flaw in other designs).  We are also introducing the Round Trip multi-voltage 23,000mAh power bank that is compatible with our largest solar panel as a perk for the truly power hungry remote worker who needs to keep a laptop computer powered while working miles from wall power.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Goals and Perks </h3>
<p>We have finished all the development and raw materials sourcing.  We have created 5 of each model with our contract manufacturer for third party testing and received the results we were targeting, so we are ready for our first production run.  We need to raise a minimum of $25,000 to make that happen. We have included all the development details at the bottom of the page if you are interested in the roadmap we followed to bring these three products to you.</p>

<p><strong>The Round Trip 23,000mAh Lithium Polymer Power Bank - BETA VERSION</strong><br/> The Round Trip is in Beta Testing and as a backer of this perk you will be come part of our pilot run and beta testing group.   Your input will be instrumental in the final production version of this product. This product is ready and safety agency approved, but a pilot run has not been completed and we have only limited tester input.  Please understand you are getting a BETA unit from the initial PILOT run of this product and it does not have all the asthetic finishing touches the retail version will have.  The case is an open mold and not our design, the internal electronics are the secret sauce and our proprietary Charge-Thru technology. </p>
<p>The round trip features a multiple voltage output selector that allows the user to chose from 5V / 7.4V / 9V / 12V / 16V / 19V output through the high-quality multiple tip cable.  You simple hold down the power button and scroll through the options to select your voltage. You can create your own cable for specific applications by mixing and matching the supplied tips.  Output current is auto-sensed and supplied from 1A to a max of 4.2A to provide the same power as your OEM adaptor. (this buffer lets you extend your work time while used in conjunction with the Base Camp or can be used as a standalone backup for your laptop)</p>
<p>Tips that are supplied are for: Apple (old style magsafe), Sharp, IBM/Lenova, Asus, HP, DELL, Fujitsu, NEC and Sony.  Many other computers share these power charging tips. Your factory OEM cables will work as designed from the USB output for Retina and Lightning versions of Apple products. </p>
<p>The Round Trip is charged from the suppled UL Listed 3A wall charger which can accept 110/240VAC at 50/60hz making it compatible world wide.  Charge time from wall power is 7-10 hours.   Charge time from the Base Camp solar panel is 15~23 hours.  It can take multiple days to charge the Round Trip from solar power depending on your sunlight conditions and usage.  The Round trip features our unique Charge-Thru(tm) technology and can be accepting a solar charge while powering a laptop or other DC powered device.  You can expect an additional 4-7 hours of additional run time from a typical laptop depending upon your usage. </p>
<h3><strong>Out of the Lab: Real World Results</strong></h3>
<p>The way solar panels are measured creates some built in disappointment for most consumers and non-solar familiar folks. (<em>We learned our lesson during out last campaign not to try to redefine how an established industry measures things!</em>)  Testing labs simulate bright, cloudless noon day sun in a perfect orientation to the solar panel at 25c creating a maximum potential output.  They measure at one sun: </p>
<ul>
<li>Voc(V) open circuit voltage</li>
<li>Isc(A) short circuit current</li>
<li>Vmp(V) maximum power voltage</li>
<li>imp(A) maximum power current</li>
<li>Pmax(W) maximum power / rated power</li>
<li>Fill Factor - a power ratio </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt=""STC Results"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/969229_493543847391305_666336417_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Solar Panel Performance Testing""/></p>
<p>In the real world you are going to have cloud cover and won't be around to direct the panel as the sun moves in many cases. So we have done some testing in a variety of real-world applications to give you an idea of how long something will take to charge - still the best indicator to the average person. </p>
<p><strong>The Walkabout averaged 380mA output</strong> from both USBs left in a single location during a lightly cloudy day.  If your phone has a 1500mAh battery it would have taken four hours to charge from empty at that rate.  With the dual outputs (one on phone/one on power bank) the Adventurer got a little better than a 50% charge in 10 hours. </p>
<p><strong>The Outback averaged closer to 700mA output</strong> from both USBs left in a single location during the same lightly cloudy day.  If your phone has a 1500mAh battery it would have taken just over 2 hours to charge from empty at that rate.  With the dual outputs (one on phone/one on power bank) the Adventurer got a full charge in under 9 hours, the Expedition got over a 65% charge in the same time period.</p>
<p><strong>The Base Camp averaged over 1000mA output</strong> through the 5VDC USB and 1A at 18VDC from the laptop charging output during a lightly cloudy day (three day test).  Your 1500mAh battery phone would have taken less than an hour and a half to charge from empty (about the same as a stock wall charger) And an iPad Retina display unit would have charged 60-65%. An Expedition charged to almost 90% in a 10 hours test.   </p>
<p>There are so many variables with laptops and we have not been able to test with all the various manufacturers combinations.  Some laptops will not allow lower current charging such as the HP Elite Book which in our testing requires 3.5A @ 18V to charge.  We are comfortable with reporting that 1A @ 18VDC charging is supported, and works very well, but you need to look at your individual charging specification for your specific laptop to determine if lower current charging is supported we do not have a master list available of all the various combinations. </p>
<p>Using the Round Trip power bank in conjunction with the Base Camp solar panel provides you the best of both worlds.  Acting as a buffer the Round Trip will power your laptop from the internal batteries while charging the internal batteries from the provided solar power.  This will extend your laptops battery by as much as 7 hours in a typical lightly cloudy day and leave you with enough extra power to charge a phone or GPS. </p>
<h3><strong>Our Development Roadmap</strong></h3>
<p><br/> We started early on with 9V mono-crystalline panels that we could readily source in Asia for all our first prototypes.  After extensive testing internally and submission to a third party testing house we determined they were not delivering the current and voltage we anticipated.  Our Two-cell ""7-Watt"" and ""10-Watt"" units came closest, but as we added more cells the miss-matches between cells added up and we saw efficiency drop and fall short of our targets. We switched to 6V cells for the higher capacity ""25-Watt"" unit and saw considerable increases in performance and cell mismatch had a smaller net impact.</p>
<p>After settling on a solar panel sources (3.5W @ 9VDC and 3.5W @ 6VDC) we set about designing a durable, foldable structure to house the assemblies. </p>
<p>We visited with a number of factories that specialized in camping goods and found one that had experience sewing up foldable solar panels. We initially provided them the panels and an optimized USB charging circuit and they sewed us up some examples for test.  We knew that we needed a large mesh pocket on the back side of the panels to hold whatever we wanted to charge and to keep it out of direct sun. This was a major flaw we noted in existing products and one of the significant improvements in ours.  They either did not provide a pocket to hold a phone or battery or they put it right on the panel side of the unit in direct sunlight! Most electronics don't like elevated temperatures and exposurer to them will reduce a product's life and can even destroy it.  We think that this is a key feature that all companies should employ (and probably will a few days after our project goes live).  </p>
<p>We reviewed the materials that the factory had the best purchasing power for and ended up selecting 600D Polyester canvas for the enclosures.  It is rugged, available in a bunch of colors (we selected black, high-visibility yellow and woodland camouflage) and inexpensive to procure.  We sketched out the pouches and where we wanted them on the units and had some functional prototypes in just a few weeks.  We learned form our last project (on <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/560071831/ultra-high-capacity-battery-for-mobile-devices"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Our Kickstarter Project"">Kickstarter</a>) that we needed to create a cohesive look and ""brand"" feel for these, and since we were doing all three at one time, it was easy to settle on stitching, embroidery, pocket locations and mounting methods. </p>
<p>We decided on 550 chord for the lighter weight units.  You can clip it to a back pack or tie it over a tent with ease.  The 550 did not hold up on the heavier 25W unit so we went back to more traditional metal grommets.  We also decided to embroider our company name into each unit right on the front, so there was no mistaking whose solar charger you have! </p>
<p>We enlisted a US company to provide third party testing over a wider range of temperatures as well.  Our first tests were very disappointing and resulted in additional tweaks until we hit the numbers we are providing you now. </p>
<h3><strong>Production Plan</strong></h3>
<p>We have identified the factories to perform the final assembly and they require a 50% deposit to start work.  Once we are successfully funded we will wire them the deposit so they can procure the materials.  From our last experience with crowd funding, it takes 10 days to transfer the money to us and backers take a week to fill out the surveys for color choice, Indiegogo says expect 15 days.  We would expect to have all our purchase orders placed within 3 weeks of a successful close to this campaign. </p>
<p>We are using our existing factory for the electronics, final packaging and test, all quoted lead-times for the raw solar panels have been taken into consideration.  We have an established track record here with an on-time reward delivery for our last project.  Our factory partner will be responsible for local market procurement, electronic assembly and test.</p>
<p>We will provide weekly updates during the production phase with photographs and adjustments if needed to the shipping schedule. </p>

<p>We feel that solar chargers should not cost a fortune and that with careful design, creative manufacturing techniques and basic economies of scale we can create a price and performance point that puts solar charging within the reach of the average technology user.  Freeing up people to enjoy the places they want to be without being tethered to a wall outlet is our goal and your support is key.  You are the critical component to our success.  There is no way we a little husband and wife team can get the word out and have any hope of reaching our goal without people like you who are willing to give us a shot and trust us to deliver on our promise. We appreciate you and know you are the backbone of what we do and pledge not to let you down! Please share our project on Facebook and Twitter!  Let your friends know about us and together we can reach out goal and bring these to market!</p>

Project Summary
There are many different versions of the portable solar panel on the market, and we aren't claiming to have invented the underlying technology, only to have improved it while creating a nexus of price and performance that puts the technology within reach of the back-country adventurer, remote worker and preparedness community. We have also optimized the form to protect the devices you are charging from direct sun exposure (a major flaw in other designs).  We are also introducing the Round Trip multi-voltage 23,000mAh power bank that is compatible with our largest solar panel as a perk for the truly power hungry remote worker who needs to keep a laptop computer powered while working miles from wall power.


Goals and Perks 
We have finished all the development and raw materials sourcing.  We have created 5 of each model with our contract manufacturer for third party testing and received the results we were targeting, so we are ready for our first production run.  We need to raise a minimum of $25,000 to make that happen. We have included all the development details at the bottom of the page if you are interested in the roadmap we followed to bring these three products to you.

The Walkabout 7W (21"" x 10"" x 0.5"" open / 10"" x 7"" x 1"" closed) This two cell solar panel weighs under 14oz (0.48kg) and has two 5V USB outputs that will charge at 500mA each.  21 x 10 x 0.5 inches when fully opened and only 10 x 7 x 1 inches when folded closed, it is perfect for keeping a battery topped off under light device loads.  We recommend plugging your device in one port and your Adventurer, Expedition or Destination into the other while you are out hiking, backpacking or sitting around your campsite. ( A Walkabout Outfitter pack is available if you don't have a power bank yet. )  Available in three colors: black, high-viz yellow and woodland camouflage.

The Outback 10W (27"" x 10"" x 0.5"" open / 10"" x 7"" x 1.5"" closed) This three cell solar panel weighs just over 22oz (0.64kg) and has two 5V USB outputs that will charge at 800+mA each.  27 x 10 x 0.5 inches when fully opened and only 10 x 7 x 1.5 inches when folded closed.  It is ideal for keeping your device battery topped off under medium to heavy loads (GPS active).  We recommend plugging your device into one and your Adventurer, Expedition or Destination into the other while you'er hiking, backpacking or sitting around your campsite. Also ideal for RVs, back decks, the beach - you get the picture. (An Outback Outfitter pack is available if you don't have a power bank yet. )   Available in three colors: black, high-viz yellow and woodland camouflage.

The Base Camp 25W (38"" x 22"" x 0.5"" open / 11"" x 7.5"" x 2"" closed) This 8 cell solar panel is our largest and most powerful unit and is wired to provide enough voltage to charge a laptop computer (18V @ 1.4A) in strong direct sunlight. This unit weighs in at 3.3 pounds (1.6kg) and measures 38 x 22 x 0.5 inches when fully opened and only 11 x 7.5 x 2.0 inches when folded closed.  The Base Camp comes with 1x 5VDC USB @ 1.5A (max), 1x 12VDC @ 2.0A (max) and 18VDC 1.4A (max).  An assortment of charging tips for a wide variety of PC laptops are included - no Apple Magsafe connectors available but there are other options out on the internet that will work with the Base Camp system for Apple.  The Base Camp was able to provide a charge to both Compaq and Samsung laptops in strong full sun with the adaptors provided during our testing. From the 12VDC output you can charge auto accessories (DVD players GPS etc) and MS Surface Tablets.  
The Base Camp Video Intro
Please Note: It will not provide a charge to a laptop computer unless sunlight conditions are ideal and will charge at a significantly slower rate than a wall charger since it is only capable of providing 38% of the current a typical laptop wall charger would provide.

A Base Camp Outfitter pack featuring the BETA Round Trip is available that will act as a buffer, accepting the solar charge while distributing the internal battery to your laptop at AC wall adaptor rates.  
 
Summary Table


The Round Trip 23,000mAh Lithium Polymer Power Bank - BETA VERSION The Round Trip is in Beta Testing and as a backer of this perk you will be come part of our pilot run and beta testing group.   Your input will be instrumental in the final production version of this product. This product is ready and safety agency approved, but a pilot run has not been completed and we have only limited tester input.  Please understand you are getting a BETA unit from the initial PILOT run of this product and it does not have all the asthetic finishing touches the retail version will have.  The case is an open mold and not our design, the internal electronics are the secret sauce and our proprietary Charge-Thru technology. 
The round trip features a multiple voltage output selector that allows the user to chose from 5V / 7.4V / 9V / 12V / 16V / 19V output through the high-quality multiple tip cable.  You simple hold down the power button and scroll through the options to select your voltage. You can create your own cable for specific applications by mixing and matching the supplied tips.  Output current is auto-sensed and supplied from 1A to a max of 4.2A to provide the same power as your OEM adaptor. (this buffer lets you extend your work time while used in conjunction with the Base Camp or can be used as a standalone backup for your laptop)
Tips that are supplied are for: Apple (old style magsafe), Sharp, IBM/Lenova, Asus, HP, DELL, Fujitsu, NEC and Sony.  Many other computers share these power charging tips. Your factory OEM cables will work as designed from the USB output for Retina and Lightning versions of Apple products. 
The Round Trip is charged from the suppled UL Listed 3A wall charger which can accept 110/240VAC at 50/60hz making it compatible world wide.  Charge time from wall power is 7-10 hours.   Charge time from the Base Camp solar panel is 15~23 hours.  It can take multiple days to charge the Round Trip from solar power depending on your sunlight conditions and usage.  The Round trip features our unique Charge-Thru(tm) technology and can be accepting a solar charge while powering a laptop or other DC powered device.  You can expect an additional 4-7 hours of additional run time from a typical laptop depending upon your usage. 
Out of the Lab: Real World Results
The way solar panels are measured creates some built in disappointment for most consumers and non-solar familiar folks. (We learned our lesson during out last campaign not to try to redefine how an established industry measures things!)  Testing labs simulate bright, cloudless noon day sun in a perfect orientation to the solar panel at 25c creating a maximum potential output.  They measure at one sun: 

Voc(V) open circuit voltage
Isc(A) short circuit current
Vmp(V) maximum power voltage
imp(A) maximum power current
Pmax(W) maximum power / rated power
Fill Factor - a power ratio 


In the real world you are going to have cloud cover and won't be around to direct the panel as the sun moves in many cases. So we have done some testing in a variety of real-world applications to give you an idea of how long something will take to charge - still the best indicator to the average person. 
The Walkabout averaged 380mA output from both USBs left in a single location during a lightly cloudy day.  If your phone has a 1500mAh battery it would have taken four hours to charge from empty at that rate.  With the dual outputs (one on phone/one on power bank) the Adventurer got a little better than a 50% charge in 10 hours. 
The Outback averaged closer to 700mA output from both USBs left in a single location during the same lightly cloudy day.  If your phone has a 1500mAh battery it would have taken just over 2 hours to charge from empty at that rate.  With the dual outputs (one on phone/one on power bank) the Adventurer got a full charge in under 9 hours, the Expedition got over a 65% charge in the same time period.
The Base Camp averaged over 1000mA output through the 5VDC USB and 1A at 18VDC from the laptop charging output during a lightly cloudy day (three day test).  Your 1500mAh battery phone would have taken less than an hour and a half to charge from empty (about the same as a stock wall charger) And an iPad Retina display unit would have charged 60-65%. An Expedition charged to almost 90% in a 10 hours test.   
There are so many variables with laptops and we have not been able to test with all the various manufacturers combinations.  Some laptops will not allow lower current charging such as the HP Elite Book which in our testing requires 3.5A @ 18V to charge.  We are comfortable with reporting that 1A @ 18VDC charging is supported, and works very well, but you need to look at your individual charging specification for your specific laptop to determine if lower current charging is supported we do not have a master list available of all the various combinations. 
Using the Round Trip power bank in conjunction with the Base Camp solar panel provides you the best of both worlds.  Acting as a buffer the Round Trip will power your laptop from the internal batteries while charging the internal batteries from the provided solar power.  This will extend your laptops battery by as much as 7 hours in a typical lightly cloudy day and leave you with enough extra power to charge a phone or GPS. 
Our Development Roadmap
 We started early on with 9V mono-crystalline panels that we could readily source in Asia for all our first prototypes.  After extensive testing internally and submission to a third party testing house we determined they were not delivering the current and voltage we anticipated.  Our Two-cell ""7-Watt"" and ""10-Watt"" units came closest, but as we added more cells the miss-matches between cells added up and we saw efficiency drop and fall short of our targets. We switched to 6V cells for the higher capacity ""25-Watt"" unit and saw considerable increases in performance and cell mismatch had a smaller net impact.
After settling on a solar panel sources (3.5W @ 9VDC and 3.5W @ 6VDC) we set about designing a durable, foldable structure to house the assemblies. 
We visited with a number of factories that specialized in camping goods and found one that had experience sewing up foldable solar panels. We initially provided them the panels and an optimized USB charging circuit and they sewed us up some examples for test.  We knew that we needed a large mesh pocket on the back side of the panels to hold whatever we wanted to charge and to keep it out of direct sun. This was a major flaw we noted in existing products and one of the significant improvements in ours.  They either did not provide a pocket to hold a phone or battery or they put it right on the panel side of the unit in direct sunlight! Most electronics don't like elevated temperatures and exposurer to them will reduce a product's life and can even destroy it.  We think that this is a key feature that all companies should employ (and probably will a few days after our project goes live).  
We reviewed the materials that the factory had the best purchasing power for and ended up selecting 600D Polyester canvas for the enclosures.  It is rugged, available in a bunch of colors (we selected black, high-visibility yellow and woodland camouflage) and inexpensive to procure.  We sketched out the pouches and where we wanted them on the units and had some functional prototypes in just a few weeks.  We learned form our last project (on Kickstarter) that we needed to create a cohesive look and ""brand"" feel for these, and since we were doing all three at one time, it was easy to settle on stitching, embroidery, pocket locations and mounting methods. 
We decided on 550 chord for the lighter weight units.  You can clip it to a back pack or tie it over a tent with ease.  The 550 did not hold up on the heavier 25W unit so we went back to more traditional metal grommets.  We also decided to embroider our company name into each unit right on the front, so there was no mistaking whose solar charger you have! 
We enlisted a US company to provide third party testing over a wider range of temperatures as well.  Our first tests were very disappointing and resulted in additional tweaks until we hit the numbers we are providing you now. 
Production Plan
We have identified the factories to perform the final assembly and they require a 50% deposit to start work.  Once we are successfully funded we will wire them the deposit so they can procure the materials.  From our last experience with crowd funding, it takes 10 days to transfer the money to us and backers take a week to fill out the surveys for color choice, Indiegogo says expect 15 days.  We would expect to have all our purchase orders placed within 3 weeks of a successful close to this campaign. 
We are using our existing factory for the electronics, final packaging and test, all quoted lead-times for the raw solar panels have been taken into consideration.  We have an established track record here with an on-time reward delivery for our last project.  Our factory partner will be responsible for local market procurement, electronic assembly and test.
We will provide weekly updates during the production phase with photographs and adjustments if needed to the shipping schedule. 
Your Impact


We feel that solar chargers should not cost a fortune and that with careful design, creative manufacturing techniques and basic economies of scale we can create a price and performance point that puts solar charging within the reach of the average technology user.  Freeing up people to enjoy the places they want to be without being tethered to a wall outlet is our goal and your support is key.  You are the critical component to our success.  There is no way we a little husband and wife team can get the word out and have any hope of reaching our goal without people like you who are willing to give us a shot and trust us to deliver on our promise. We appreciate you and know you are the backbone of what we do and pledge not to let you down! Please share our project on Facebook and Twitter!  Let your friends know about us and together we can reach out goal and bring these to market!

ZiBear connects to your iPhone or Android smartphone via bluetooth. ZiBear will say, do and sing anything you'd like, using content you've created yourself, or that you've downloaded from our store. 

ZiBear can even connect to the internet and answer questions intelligently if you let it. You're completely in control of everything ZiBear can say and do so you can turn this feature on and off as you like.
Why did we make ZiBear?
We wanted to bring some magic back to traditional children's toys. We all remember imagining that our toys came to life when we weren't looking. Now they really do!
What can ZiBear do?
ZiBear can listen to what you say and talk back. You can make ZiBear say anything you'd like, and even better, you can customise what ZiBear says when you ask it a particular question! Endless fun, but great if you want to practise words with your children or even help them study!

Let's get quizzical!
You can create your own quizzes with ZiBear. You just add your questions and answers and ZiBear will know if it's the correct answer. Simple, brilliant fun and games.
Sing and Dance
ZiBear can play any song or piece of music you have in your phone, just like a bluetooth speaker so you can sing and dance along to all your favourite tunes!
Storytime!
Download stories, or add your own and ZiBear will read the whole thing for you.
ZiBear takes advantage of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things, giving you Endless Content. 

Powering the magic with our apps


We are a passionate team of developers, designers and engineers. We've created custom Android and iPhone apps from scratch to power ZiBear. If you're a developer, we'll be producing an SDK so you can create custom apps yourself!Type quick messages for ZiBear to say, or choose from a bank of messages you've saved
Build up your own ZiBear's brain! Store as many question and answer combinations as you'd like
Your ZiBear can quiz your kids using your own questions - just tell ZiBear you'd like to play a quiz

Your ZiBear can sing along to any music on your phoneYour ZiBear can read stories stored on your phoneYou can set default commands for your ZiBear
Moreover, you can get rich contents from ZiBear content storeWhat's inside ZiBear?
A quality motor that acts as ZiBear's skeleton, mouth and ears.

Inside the unit, there's an embedded chip which has a microcontroller, Bluetooth 3.0 transmitter and receiver, and our sound detection and analysis algorithm which works out when to move ZiBear for more natural motion. There's also a really great speaker and a rechargeable lithium ion battery so no more fishing around for spare batteries! 

How did we get here?Please see our gallery for the full ZiBear development route. Unique ZiBear AccessoriesWhat languages can ZiBear speak?
Arabic,Chinese (China, HK, Taiwan), Czech,Danish, Dutch, English (Australia, Ireland, South Africa, UK, US), Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian,  Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish,  Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish (Mexico, Spain, Sweden), Thai and Turkish. 
PLEASE NOTE that the voice you hear in the video is only available in English. Voices in other languages will vary, but don't worry! ZiBear is highly adaptive, so if you don't like the voice, you can simply change it for another. We'll provide information on how to do this. ZiBear loves developers
We offer a full SDK (Software Development Kit) as a starting point to give you a chance to be more creative than us. You have complete freedom to integrate ZiBear into your software app or hardware system, and make your customised version of ZiBear to surprise your children and friends. There's absolutely no limitation.
Who are we?
We're Zetta Sense, a new startup based in London. We take an innovative approach to developing products and applications that push the limits of what's possible, and change the way we think about technology.
Development status
We have ZiBear almost completely ready to deliver. There are some minor improvements  we need to make to ZiBear (better microphone, up to 0.5 meters) and the mobile apps (testing on more android versions and phones), but other than that we have a working bear!
The app will be published in both Google Play and iTunes App Store for download once the campaign is successful. We'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions for ZiBear and the apps. We'll do our best to add any outstanding features.
How will the funds be used?
We need to manufacture a relatively large amount of ZiBears in order to deliver the right quality, at the right price. We've developed a great relationship with one of the best manufacturers in China, who have more than 20 years experience in this area, and we're very happy that they can meet our requirements. All funds raised will go towards this initial order. If we don't meet the campaign goal then all funds will be returned. Timeline

<h1><strong>What is the 80’s Brick Phone?</strong></h1>
<p>It is a totally rad <strong>Bluetooth headset</strong> that connects to any Bluetooth capable device and makes it appear that you are talking on an old school 80’s “Brick” phone just like Gordon Gekko or Zach Morris. Guaranteed to make your friends crack up, and then wish they were anywhere near as cool as you are.</p>

<h1><strong>How does it work?</strong></h1>
<p>You just pair the 80’s Brick Phone with your Bluetooth capable cell phone and when you get a call on your phone, you answer it on your Brick Phone. You don’t even have to take your “modern day” cell phone out of your pocket. When you’re done with the call, you just hang up. That’s it. The 80’s Brick Phone charges via a mini usb cable that you can simply plug in to your computer.</p>

<h1>
<strong>Will it work with my phone?</strong> </h1>
<p>The 80’s Brick Phone will work with any Bluetooth capable phone including the iPhone, Android, Windows and other phones. If your phone has Bluetooth capability, you can use the 80’s Brick Phone. </p>
<h1><strong>Where will the money be spent? </strong></h1>
<p>The majority of the funds raised will go towards the fabrication of the molds for the phone parts. Injection Molds cost anywhere from $15,000 to upwards of $100k and I need your help to get mine made. This particular design consists of 4 pieces so we'll need 4 molds, each costing about $8,000. Other things that the IndieGoGo campaign will cover are things like electronics engineering fees, mechanical engineering fees, packaging design, fulfillment costs, etc. I have assembled a top notch team to help with all aspects of the project and I'm confident that you will see that in the final product.</p>

<h1><strong>Why a Brick Phone? </strong></h1>
<p>Because it’s TOTALLY AWESOME! </p>
<h1><strong>Who am I? </strong></h1>
<p>My name is Brad and I’m a designer, artist, writer, filmmaker, dad, and husband. I have a degree in Industrial Design and also have a feature film floating around out there. I love coming up with new gadgets and ideas, and thought the 80's Brick Phone would be super fun to make a reality. I really appreciate your support and hope you love this phone as much as I do. </p>

<p>This has been a really fun project to get going and I can’t keep going without your help. Anything you can pledge helps and I truly appreciate every single dollar. Pre-buy your phone now with the $35 pledge level (add $10 for shipping in the US) and help me make this phone a reality. And of course, thank you for your support.</p></div>","What is the 80’s Brick Phone?

<h2>Sodraft - The Social Evolution of Fantasy Sports</h2>
Do you love your fantasy sports but sometimes feel limited by your traditional leagues? Maybe you have tried a salary cap or daily league to be more socially engaged, but it still just doesn't seem like enough. With everything else becoming social, why is your favorite fantasy sports game still limited to small leagues?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As fantasy sport fanatics ourselves, we realized the only thing holding us back was the draft. With virtually limitless technology at our finger tips, why had someone not yet developed a social fantasy game which incorporated the strategic elements of a traditional snake draft into some kind of draft simulator where you are not competing against a computer? Although everyone we talked to said, ""someone must have done that already"", we couldn't find. So, we decided we'd give it a try.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What we then developed is the first fantasy sports platform which provides a <strong>true</strong> <strong>social fantasy experience</strong>, all without compromising the integrity or core strategy of a traditional fantasy draft. Combined with all the key functionality of a social networking platform, users can play, share, and engage with as many or as few others as they like. One platform... limitless competition.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2><strong>The Basics of How our Draft Works</strong></h2>
<p>Sodraft’s proprietary draft simulator combines a traditional snake draft (serpentine) format with a 3 tier set-path picking system, generating up to 7 trillion unique team combinations.</p>
<p>For American Football, the players are split into 8 positional squads containing 33 players each:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quarterback</li>
<li>Running Back</li>
<li>Wide Receiver 1</li>
<li>Wide Receiver 2</li>
<li>Tight End</li>
<li>Line Backer</li>
<li>Defensive Back</li>
<li>Kicker</li>
</ol><p>Players are then situated in serpentine format according to their projected ranking. The user must then use their sports’ knowledge to pick their squad from the 45 different 3 player combinations.</p>

<p><strong><br/></strong>To assist the user with comparing their options, the draft interface has a ""Scouting Sheet"" which allows the user to drag any 3 player combination into an area where they can see total past and projected stats. The potential squads can be manually moved around and ranked as many times as the user likes until they have finalized their decision.</p>

<strong>Help Us Run a Beta Test for the 2013 NFL Season</strong>.</h2>
<p>We first conceived our draft in September 2011. With the help of friends and family, we were able to secure our intellectual property and develop a basic platform. Shortly after, we launched an Alpha test for the 2012 MLB Season. Unfortunately, things did not go as planned and we forced to unexpectedly shut down the site.</p>
<p>With the help of some amazing team members, original and new, we were able to evaluate our mistakes and revise our strategies. Now, we are ready to move forward with the platform once again, but before we put it out to investors to finance a complete launch, we thought it best to test our draft with the public and see if our potential users think it’s as great as we do. And, what better place to do this then on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>Today, our goal is to raise enough funds to cover fees for hosting and licensing of the real-time stats for a full beta test of our new platform for the 2013 NFL season. If we can reach our goal, we will make the complete beta platform available to the public by Thursday, August 29<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>We have opted for a ""Fixed Funding"" campaign as we can not move forward with the Beta unless we meet our goal. Therefore, you can feel assured that you will receive a refund on your contribution if we are unable to collectively raise enough through this campaign to meet the needs of launching for this years' NFL season.</p>
<p>If we are successful in reaching our funding goal and completing a beta test, we hope to then raise enough capital to start rolling out additional sports starting with MLB in 2014. After that, the platform could be expanded into NBA, NHL, NCAAF, PGA, NASCAR, F1 and IPL, with potential for a number of additional leagues world-wide in the future.</p>
<p>Every Fantasy Sports Fan who has tried our draft loves it, so with your help we are confident we can all make this a success together. There is no doubt that the next step in the evolution of fantasy sports will be a social draft, so why not become one of the founding members and help us make this a reality!</p>
<p><strong>*Please note</strong>: A ""Fixed Funding"" campaign requires payment via PayPal. <strong>To contribute without setting up a PayPal account</strong>, simply follow contribution prompts, then when PayPal login screen appears, click on ""Pay with a Credit or Debit Card"" tab below login area<strong>*</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Our Unique Perks<br/></strong></h2>
<p>As we are not a manufacturing or production company, and we will never charge our users to play on our site, we cannot pre-sell products or memberships. We were determined though to find a way to offer our contributors value. Finally, we came up with the concept of partnering with like-minded companies who offer fantastic products that will appeal to the core of our future user base. As a Result, we were able to partner with LavaTickets.com, StarStreet.com and Cardboard Memories Autographed Collectibles to make some fantastic rewards available to our generous contributors.</p>

<h3>Why Indiegogo</h3>
<p>A friend told me about Indiegogo after I launched my campaign on KS. I went through a month back and forth with KS editing my campaign, reshooting video footage and with each edit more and more of my content was disappearing, like my CAD drawings which they stated were not allowed. Frustrated, the campaign finally was approved and I decided to launch despite the fact most of my content was gone. I felt like there is a double standard on KS so I decided to try indiegogo. I’m looking forward to a successful campaign on Indiegogo. Thank you.</p>
<h2>What Is Neo-Plug</h2>
<h3>Neo-Plug is a new and convenient adapter that consists of 2 parts. The first part, the “adapter” slips over your existing data cable or charger and has very strong rare earth magnets on the end, neodymium magnets. These magnets allow the data cable or charger to effortlessly snap into place with the second part, the “plug”, which resides inside your iPhone, iPad or Micro USB device.</h3>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Story Behind the Idea:</strong></p>
<p>I came up with the idea while driving my car and trying to plug the charger into the phone. I said to myself <em>wouldn’t it be great if the charger could just snap into place by itself when it comes close to the port.</em> When I returned home that night I couldn't sleep, because I immediately started thinking of how to design something like this, which parts to use, and how to build a working prototype.</p>
<p><img alt=""1st working Neo-Plug prototype"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lolawireless.com/neoplug/1st-prototype.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""1st working Neo-Plug prototype""/></p>
<p>1st working Neo-Plug prototype</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I knew the working prototype wouldn’t be pretty, but at least it will help people visualize the concept. I knew I needed to show a better representation of the project, so I hired a 3D CAD designer and we closely worked together in order to make Neo-Plug come to life and produce a first rapid prototype.</p>

<p>Neo-Plug is intended to be used with your existing data cable or charger, yes it passes data as well so it can be used to SYNC your device or transfer data. Neo-Plug simply transforms your existing cable to a magnetic connector. Neo-Plug comes in 3 versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A flush adapter that goes over your existing cable just like in the above CAD drawings.</li>
<li>A 3’ foot extension, this version will extend you existing cable another 3’</li>
<li>A 6’ foot extension, this version will extend you existing cable another 6’</li>

<h2><strong>Neo-Plug, a Fun Play on Words.</strong></h2>
<p>I’m sure many of you are wondering, Neo-Plug, the plug part makes sense, but neo? Well, it’s a fun play on words. What makes Neo-Plug work are tiny rare earth magnets which are extremely strong and are made of a material called neodymium. Unfortunately, neodymium itself is a poor conductor and therefore doesn’t pass electric current very well, which doesn’t make it a great candidate for electrical connectors. After doing research I found some great news! Neodymium can be plated with gold, since gold is an excellent electrical conductor; I incorporated gold plated neodymium magnets into the design to serve as contacts for not only charging the device, but also passing data to or from the device.</p>
<h2><strong>No More Poking Around.</strong></h2>
<p>Have you ever been frustrated by the process of plugging in your devices charger or data cable? You first twist it, look under it, aligned it properly, and finally plug it in. Neo-Plug will eliminate the frustration and tedious steps, since each Neo-Plug has uniquely placed magnets to make it impossible to plug the charger or data cable in the wrong way. It’s natural. The magnet won’t allow it.</p>
<h2><strong>Say Good-Bye to Smashed Cords, Broken Contacts, and Terminals.</strong></h2>
<p>Broken terminals inside a device are a thing of the past. So many devices need to be sent in for repair, because the charging port was damaged from too much pressure being applied to the charging connector. In some cases the terminal is beyond repair and a new phone must be purchased. Connectors themselves can become damaged from too many reinserts, but Neo-Plug eliminates the likelihood of damaged hardware by simply inserting the “plug” carefully into the devices port and it remains inside the terminal. That’s it!</p>
<h2><strong>Moving forward.</strong></h2>
<p>I know the idea is great. Also, I absolutely love the concept and application of the design. I have the technical knowledge and experience to make my idea a reality, which will ultimately, bring Neo-Plug to your device. Even though I love the idea and so does everyone else here at Lola Wireless, I don’t know if everyone else in the world will love it as well, which is why I’m glad Kickstarter is here to help me. Not only does Kickstarter allow me to share the idea with you, but also allows me to identify if people are interested in Neo-Plug. All the funds will be used to bring Neo-Plug to you. We are ready for a production run, only challenge at the moment is funding. Your support will allow this final step to be completed and bring Neo-Plug to your device and into the market for others to enjoy.</p>
<h2>Why we need your help</h2>
<p>Mass production and manufacturing is expensive and requires minimum commit levels. The $167,000.00 we are asking from the community is a carefully calculated number that will allow us to have the molds, parts, assembly, packaging and shipping accomplished. We even calculated the percentages that get taken out by the funding platform and worked it into the number. I have funded this project and idea up to this point with my company Lola Wireless Inc, and the next step unfortunately is way out of budget for me. This is the absolute minimum we need to bring Neo-Plug to you and to the market. We love the idea and so does everyone we show this too, but we can’t make this project a product without your help.</p>

 Risks and Challenges
Every project is expected to face obstacles at one point or another during the project completion journey. With my extensive knowledge in electronics, business, and time management I will be able to keep risks to a minimum and conquer any obstacles I face along the way. The biggest obstacle I will face is making sure the product will start shipping when promised. I will personally be involved in every step of the project; from mold development to the manufacturing process in order to ensure each backer receives a top quality neo-plug by the expected deadline. Project updates will be posted on our website www.neo-plug.com and we welcome backers’ involvement and comments as the project progresses.",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

Look This Project  - 
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1557236816...
It is present-day revolutionary teapot, which can be operated apart with the help of wi-fi. 
Now you don't need to get up from your favourite sofa, to abstract from your work or domestic chores - just forget about such things! 
You have wiPot now! You can easily operate it with the help of your smartphone! 
With the help of wiPot you can boil water in a pot from any place, where ever you are. Using the wiPot and its system of pre-boiling you save up to 5 minutes at one time and up to 48 hours during the year! 
wiPot is a clever pot - with the help of the app it can inform you when the temperature of water will be exactly you need and how much water is in a pot. You will be able to choose out of five introduced temperatures, because different water temperature is suitable for different kinds of tea. Otherwise you can spoil its refined taste. 

Forget all you know about teapots before. wiPot is the revolution in the world of teapots. It can take care of you and your family. Now you can spend more time with your family and there is no need to abstract from your daily chores - wiPot will do everything for you. 

wiPot knows how difficult can be to get up early in the morning. While you are getting ready for a new day it can boil the water to the desired temperature. It can also memorize the mode of selected time and days of the week and you don't need to remind all these modes to the teapot - It can do everything! 


As soon as you are in a zone of your domestic wi-fi your smartphone will connect to wiPot and will be ready to serve you. By the time you will get to your kitchen it will boil water with needed temperature for you. 


It is impossible to get burned when you use an wiPot. 
The final prototype will be produced with a special led lighting - the water temperature indicator. It is so easy: red means ""too hot"", orange means ""hot"", yellow means ""warm"" and white means ""you can touch it"". 
Also, wiPot will become the decoration of your kitchen and cool present for your family and friends.  Limpid and glass case doesn't produce harmful impurities into the water and doesn’t affect the taste of the water. If you won't have your smartphone within easy reach, but you'll need to know how much water do you have in your pot - it won't be a problem for you! You'll easily get such information. There is no need to pull the cover or to stare at the water level scale every time. 
You can operate the wiPot by pressing buttons on a practical heat-resistant base glass.

With the mobile and web applications, you can check your and your loved-ones brushing habits easily!

                                


Do you love your current toothbrush? We love it too, that's why we designed Koala in a way that it can fit most of the toothbrushes in the market. We are working with professional materials engineers to design the elastic case of the device so it can hold 30mm to 55mm circumference.

                          

                                            



Features



Sound Notifications, Koala guides you to brush your teeth properly with sound notifications and helps you to reach 2 minutes. It beeps every 30 seconds, first minute, second minute and third minute.

<h3>Welcome to 321-RIDE!</h3>
<br/><p></p>
<p>Drinking and driving sucks. When you drink and drive you risk being arrested, causing an accident, or worse, killing somebody. More over, a DUI can spell financial ruin, costing more then $10,000 in legal expenses. In a day and age of social media, your friends, family, and coworkers will undoubtedly hear about it and ask you questions. You might even lose your job. Everybody wants to have fun, nobody wants to get in trouble.</p>
<p>321-RIDE has a very simple premise; after a night out, we drive you home in your vehicle. Our clients call or text to order a ride. A chauffeur is immediately dispatched to the clients location. Upon arrival the chauffeur drives the client home in the client's vehicle. A second driver follows behind in a separate vehicle and picks up the chauffeur when the ride is complete. Rides are charged based on a flat rate plus mileage, with an average charge of $62 per ride. 321-RIDE is a membership based service, currently with an annual fee of $200. With our expansion we will be changing to a monthly membership model, under $8 per month.</p>
<p>For more then 6 years, 321-RIDE has been in business in Greater Cincinnati to help our clients better enjoy their nights out. We are now ready to embrace new technology and expand far beyond the Cincinnati area. The money raised in this campaign will go directly into the creation of a mobile app for both iPhone &amp; Android. Imagine sitting in a loud bar and scheduling your own chauffeur with the press of just one button and never having to get out of your seat. Even better, the app will allow you to share 321-RIDE with friends and get rewarded for doing so! The app will revolutionize how 321-RIDE operates. Individuals will be able to sign up and order a ride at anytime. The funds raised will also go to covering the start up expenses for business launch in Columbus and Cleveland. Help us expand so that we can help you and your friends have more enjoyable nights out. You have fun, we will drive.</p>

<p>Your donation will be used to design, build and implement a mobile app for both iPhone and Android platforms. The app will make 321-RIDE an on demand service, where a person can download the app, sign up, and order a ride in less then 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the benefits of a mobile app for our clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>One touch ride ordering - no phone calls or text messages needed</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">No waiting on hold, no dispatchers</span></li>
<li>Refer a friend and earn free rides</li>
<li>No need to leave the bar or go somewhere quiet to call for a ride</li>
<li>Always know where your chauffeur is and how long until they will be to you</li>
<li>Faster pick up times</li>
<li>Ability to rate chauffeurs after each ride</li>
<li>You can choose your favorite chauffeur or let the app pick for you</li>
<li>Simplicity; all of your information is securely stored, no cash needed, ever!</li>
</ul>
<p>With building the mobile app, 321-RIDE will update its back end systems which will allow for a more streamlined business that is ready to grow. New back end features will include quicker communication of information to chauffeurs, ability to track location of chauffeurs at all times, and automatic payroll systems.</p>

<p>With your help we can bring 321-RIDE to cities throughout Ohio and beyond. Our expansion will help individuals better enjoy their night, but it will also allow for restaurants to take better care of their valuable customers via a free chauffeur home. Most importantly 321-RIDE's expansion will mean fewer drunk drivers on the road. Which means we are all safer in the end.</p>
<p>Our goal is for 321-RIDE to open for business in Columbus in June of 2014 followed by Cleveland a few months later. Our unique form of transportation will transform how you enjoy night life. Whether you go out and enjoy a drink once a week or once a year, 321-RIDE will be on call to assist you.</p>

<h3>
<br/>Sweet, my phone's got 3 pin connectors on the side!</h3>
<p>If you own a Galaxy Nexus, I'm sure you were like I was, excited to hear about the 3 pin connectors on the side of the phone. That excitement quickly died off when we saw that the docks that Verizon was selling for the Galaxy Nexus did <strong>not</strong> come with pogo pins to charge our phone. The dock is really nice, but you still need to unplug and plug in the phone every time you need to take it off and on the dock. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>GSM Car Dock</strong></h3>
<p>The GSM version of the Galaxy Nexus has this type of dock available in Europe and is slowly making it's way to the US. When it finally does get here, it's expected to be priced around $60-$80 (<a href=""http://www.clove.co.uk/official-vehicle-dock-samsung-galaxy-nexus-ecs-k1f2begstd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.clove.co.uk/official-vehicle-dock-samsung-galaxy-nexus-ecs-k1f2begstd</a>)  The GSM Car Dock with pogo pins is <strong>not</strong> compatible with the LTE version of the Galaxy Nexus and there are rumors that Verizon is not going to support the pogo pins so we may never even see this dock.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img alt=""dock"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/12/galaxy-nexus-cardock-1202.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""dock""/></p>
<h3>So it's up to us then...</h3>
<p>This is when I decided to take things into my own hands, literally. I saw that there were a few people that have already done a similar mod in online forums, so I knew it would be possible. The only thing was that to get the parts, you need to order direct from the manufacturers which have a minimum order of 1,000! </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Need funding!</h3>
<p>So I decided to start an Indiegogo project for all of those Verizon customers that would like try this mod out for themselves and save them the trouble of trying to find the right pieces to make it work. If we can get enough supporters, these parts will be available to anyone, not just big companies. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>So, exactly what are we talking about here?</h3>
<p>In this DIY kit you not only get the pogo pins that will work with your phone but also a pogo pin holder which will space out the 3 pins perfectly so that they will line up with the connectors on the side of your phone. All you need to do is take out a bit of the rubber with a dremel from your dock and pop in the holder with the pogo pins inside. They are then soldered to 2 pieces of wire which are embeded inside the rubber of the case by making 2 slits. This makes it practically invisible once you're done. The wires are then soldered to a micro USB receptacle that you will attach to the back of the dock. </p>
<p><img alt=""3 pin dock"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i50.tinypic.com/fogooy.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""3 pin dock""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img alt=""Micro USB"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i47.tinypic.com/28u7klc.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Micro USB""/></p>
<h3>Smart, programable dock</h3>
<p>You will also receive a programmable NFC sticker that you can hid inside of the dock (behind the ""Samsung"" cover). This will let you program your dock to do a variety of things once the phone is docked. It can launch apps, adjust settings, etc...</p>
<p><img alt=""nfc"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ubergizmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nfc-android.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""nfc""/></p>
<p>You can purchase the official Samsung Dock in Amazon for about $30 which doesn't have the 3-pins. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-ECS-K1F8BEGSTA-Verizon-Galaxy-Nexus/dp/B006NYP61K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337128515&amp;sr=8-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-ECS-K1F8BEGSTA-Verizon-Galaxy-Nexus/dp/B006NYP61K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337128515&amp;sr=8-1</a></p>

This is when I decided to take things into my own hands, literally. I saw that there were a few people that have already done a similar mod in online forums, so I knew it would be possible. The only thing was that to get the parts, you need to order direct from the manufacturers which have a minimum order of 1,000! 
 
Need funding!
So I decided to start an Indiegogo project for all of those Verizon customers that would like try this mod out for themselves and save them the trouble of trying to find the right pieces to make it work. If we can get enough supporters, these parts will be available to anyone, not just big companies. 
 
So, exactly what are we talking about here?
In this DIY kit you not only get the pogo pins that will work with your phone but also a pogo pin holder which will space out the 3 pins perfectly so that they will line up with the connectors on the side of your phone. All you need to do is take out a bit of the rubber with a dremel from your dock and pop in the holder with the pogo pins inside. They are then soldered to 2 pieces of wire which are embeded inside the rubber of the case by making 2 slits. This makes it practically invisible once you're done. The wires are then soldered to a micro USB receptacle that you will attach to the back of the dock. 

 
 
Smart, programable dock
You will also receive a programmable NFC sticker that you can hid inside of the dock (behind the ""Samsung"" cover). This will let you program your dock to do a variety of things once the phone is docked. It can launch apps, adjust settings, etc...

You can purchase the official Samsung Dock in Amazon for about $30 which doesn't have the 3-pins. http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-ECS-K1F8BEGSTA-Verizon-Galaxy-Nexus/dp/B006NYP61K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1337128515&sr=8-1",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Imperial Code Cylinder / USB-Stick</b></p>

<p><b>What is this all about?</b></p>
<p>As part of the
501st Legion (biggest Star Wars costuming club worldwide) I wanted to do an
imperial officer costume. Part of the costume are the so called “imperial code
cylinders”. In the first three Star Wars movies (1977-1983) they used radiation
dosimeters, but today these dosimeters are very rare and hard to come by and
most of the time very expansive, so I thought about creating a replica and when
I took the dimensions I realized that it had the perfect size for an USB-stick.
In-universe the code cylinders are for data transportation and security codes –
a perfect fit if you ask me! </p>
<p><img alt=""imperial-USB"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd144/TR-7518/picture-002.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b><span>About me &amp; the project:</span></b>
<p>My Name is
Andreas Laube and I’m from Germany. I’m part of the 501<sup>st</sup> Legion (biggest
Star Wars costuming club worldwide) and a huge Star Wars Fan. <br/><br/>
I just want to do this and already put much effort into this project, but I
can’t do it all on my own. The molds for the stick and production-costs (almost all
manufacturers start production at a minimum of 500 pieces when it comes to metal usb-sticks) are very expansive
for one person alone and I just don’t have that amount of money at hand. So I
asked my friends and members of the 501<sup>st</sup> Legion if they’d be
interested in an USB-Stick like that and the feedback was very positive!<br/></p>
<p><img alt=""imperial-USB"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd144/TR-7518/picture-003.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
But I’m sure there are more Star Wars fans out there who’d be interested in
this, so I decided to make it public and available for everyone. 

<p>I’ve got
many offers from different companies and I decided the 16GB / USB 2.0 version has
the best price performance ratio. This will be a replica / costuming-piece and
I see the USB-feature as a little gimmick!<br/><b><br/>
USB-Stick specifications:</b></p>
<p><b>Dimensions:</b> <span>  65mm
(2.56”) long / 15mm (0.6”) in diameter [plus the clip]<br/><b>USB-Standard:</b>  USB 2.0<br/><b>Capacity:</b>   16GB<br/><b>Material:</b>  metal <br/><br/>

What is this all about?
As part of the
501st Legion (biggest Star Wars costuming club worldwide) I wanted to do an
imperial officer costume. Part of the costume are the so called “imperial code
cylinders”. In the first three Star Wars movies (1977-1983) they used radiation
dosimeters, but today these dosimeters are very rare and hard to come by and
most of the time very expansive, so I thought about creating a replica and when
I took the dimensions I realized that it had the perfect size for an USB-stick.
In-universe the code cylinders are for data transportation and security codes –
a perfect fit if you ask me! 

About me & the project:
My Name is
Andreas Laube and I’m from Germany. I’m part of the 501st Legion (biggest
Star Wars costuming club worldwide) and a huge Star Wars Fan. 
I just want to do this and already put much effort into this project, but I
can’t do it all on my own. The molds for the stick and production-costs (almost all
manufacturers start production at a minimum of 500 pieces when it comes to metal usb-sticks) are very expansive
for one person alone and I just don’t have that amount of money at hand. So I
asked my friends and members of the 501st Legion if they’d be
interested in an USB-Stick like that and the feedback was very positive!


But I’m sure there are more Star Wars fans out there who’d be interested in
this, so I decided to make it public and available for everyone. 

I’ve got
many offers from different companies and I decided the 16GB / USB 2.0 version has
the best price performance ratio. This will be a replica / costuming-piece and
I see the USB-feature as a little gimmick!
USB-Stick specifications:
Dimensions:   65mm
(2.56”) long / 15mm (0.6”) in diameter [plus the clip]USB-Standard:  USB 2.0Capacity:   16GBMaterial:  metal 
Perhaps it is even possible to add a small light-up feature if attached to
a device (blue ring), we’ll see!
Project-plan:I’ve arranged everything, so if we hit the goal I’ll let production start. This
will most likely take about 4-6 weeks, so I could ship the sticks early in
December. My plan is to everyone get their USB-Sticks before Christmas 2013! If
we don’t hit the goal, everybody gets their money back and nothing happens… :/Perks:Prices for shipping and handling not included, please add the appropriate

<p>The creators of the <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wipy/the-wipy-the-internet-of-things-taken-to-the-next/description"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WiPy</a> are back!</p>
<p>So, what are we saying? 
The LoRa, WiFi and BLE Micro controller and LoRa Nano gateway for enterprise grade connected Things. With the latest chipset the LoPy offers a perfect combination of power, friendliness and flexibility. <b><i>Create and connect your things everywhere. Fast. </i></b></p>
<p>We have created a hardware platform with four times the memory of previous generation micro controllers, three wireless network types, a product that can act as a LoRa nano gateway allowing you to connect up to 100 LoPy's. Create your own little private network and become a neighbourhood hero! When used as a private nano gateway, it will connect your other LoRa devices up to 5km however expect up to 40km range (when in line of sight) when connecting your LoPy to a LoRa gateway of a network provider! </p>
<h1>LoPy Benefits </h1>
<p>★LoRa Nano gateway or just LoRa/WiFi/BLE device – you choose ★ MicroPython enabled, use ""the Linux of IoT"" to achieve speedy developments ★ super small and light to fit in any cavity★ Ever so low power to enable years of battery life so there’s no need for new nuclear power stations to run millions of LoPys ★ 

What’s more…
With dozens of ready to use templates and much more added options, now you can create almost anything that comes to your mind. Combination of advanced content importers, different layouts, header styles, post types,… gives you a freedom and control you have never seen before. And you can do it all with the new Pymakr IDE. </p>

<br/><h1>And what if you could build your own LoRa network?</h1>
<p>Here is the clever part, you can use the module to switch a comms signal from WiFi to LoRa (and vice versa) thus making the LoPy both a LoRa Receiver / Transmitter and a Nano gateway capable of handling comms with up to 100 other LoRa nodes! This means you can go and create your own LoRa network for you, your friends or just your Things! No monthly bills for connectivity. 
All you need to turn the LoPy into a LoRa Nano Gateway is a LoPy kit including antennas, a power supply and fingers to type in some code.

The way it works is illustrated below: </p>

<p><b>MicroPython is the Linux of IoT</b> </p>
<p>The rapid-results microcontroller scripting language of the future. Simple, powerful and fit for purpose, this nifty new open source scripting language came about to replace long winded programming that is overkill for microcontrollers, a key component for electronics based products. MicroPython leverages the existing Python 3.4 design and optimizes it for microcontrollers to enable a lighter, faster and better coding environment that both programmers and hardware developers can use with ease.
Pycom continues and will continue to fund the development of core MicroPython features to ensure they stay Open Source. </p>

<p>And then …
All those hardware specs are awesome, but it get’s better still. The LoPy is really easy to use, because we have written a powerful and intuitive IDE – the Pymakr to make it even easier for you to program in your browser and load straight to the LoPy (read on for more information on Pymakr).</p>
<p>Pymakr connects automatically to your WiPy or LoPy via the serial or Telnet Server, runs your code on the fly, manages the internal file system, synchronizes your code instantly and runs it with just one click. It also takes care of firmware upgrades and includes a built in console that interfaces with the MicroPython REPL. Features code completion, static analysis, PEP8 style checking and a built-in interactive prompt.

Pymakr is the one and only tool you'll ever need to develop on the WiPy and LoPy.</p>
<p>PyMakr will be open source and we will release it right after the campaign is finished.</p>
<p>LoPy will also be compatible with THE ARDUINO IDE.</p>

<p><b>What is LoRa?</b> 
LoRa is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) specification intended for wireless battery operated Things. LoRaWAN meets the key requirements of Internet of Things such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility and localization services.

<p>For instance, we found a company as passionate as ourselves, SENET, based out of Boston, USA. In fact, they are so keen to support our developer community that they have agreed for each Pycom developer to connect (free of charge for non commercial applications) 2 LoPy devices onto their networks! At present they have deployed over 100,000 square miles of network coverage across the US with concentrations in the Northeast, the Midwest, and California.  During 2016, network deployment will continue on an aggressive pace including deep coverage in the innovation districts of greater Boston and the San Francisco Bay area.</p>

<p>So if you are lucky enough to live in those regions then try connecting to the Senet network! 

Elsewhere, you can connect to the OpenSource network “The Things Network” whom also happen to be Dutch…. They have/will have coverage in the following cities: </p>
<p>Sao Paolo (Brazil), Cape Town (South Africa), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Kochi (India), Port of Rotterdam / Rotterdam / Amsterdam / Flevoland/ Groningen / Eindhoven / Friesland / Den Haag / Utrecht / Maastricht (Holland), Zurich (Switzerland), Poznan (Poland), Montreal / Ottawa / Kanata (Canada),  Montevideo (Uruguay), Perth (Australia), Mexico City (Mexico), Belfast (Ireland), Austin / Boston (US), Milan (Italy), Johannesburg (South Africa), Huesca (Spain), Copenhagen (Denmark), Dunedin (New Zealand), and Thatcham / Calderdale / Manchester (UK). </p>
<p>And if you live elsewhere… <b><i>be a NEIGHBORHOOD Hero</i></b> and use your LoPy as the LoRa nano gateway to see how many ‘Things’ you can connect in a 5KM radius! Mmmhhh could be a nice little competition here… more on that later in the year. </p>

Frequencies will depend on region. 
Power Hungry? 
We don’t think so. No need for new nuclear power stations to power the LoPys of this world. In fact, we’re quite confident we have a product that is mirroring the WiPy's SUPER 
GREEN CREDENTIALS as the LoPy consumes only: 
★0.1% of Raspberry Pi B+
★1.5% of the Arduino Mega
★5.27% of a Particle Photon
This is great news if you want to create something that is connected for longer periods and powered with a battery.







And what if you could build your own LoRa network?
Here is the clever part, you can use the module to switch a comms signal from WiFi to LoRa (and vice versa) thus making the LoPy both a LoRa Receiver / Transmitter and a Nano gateway capable of handling comms with up to 100 other LoRa nodes! This means you can go and create your own LoRa network for you, your friends or just your Things! No monthly bills for connectivity. 
All you need to turn the LoPy into a LoRa Nano Gateway is a LoPy kit including antennas, a power supply and fingers to type in some code.

The way it works is illustrated below: 



LoRa Nano Gateway Overview


We will provide the Python library needed to make the LoPy operate as a nano gateway and let you run your own private (or not, share it with your friends!) network.
We will supply more information about how to get the LoPy working as a nano gateway before the shipments in August 2016.





MicroPython is the Linux of IoT 
The rapid-results microcontroller scripting language of the future. Simple, powerful and fit for purpose, this nifty new open source scripting language came about to replace long winded programming that is overkill for microcontrollers, a key component for electronics based products. MicroPython leverages the existing Python 3.4 design and optimizes it for microcontrollers to enable a lighter, faster and better coding environment that both programmers and hardware developers can use with ease.
Pycom continues and will continue to fund the development of core MicroPython features to ensure they stay Open Source. 










MicroPython and LoRa:We think MicroPython makes developing super fun!



LoRa in MicroPython example







And then …
All those hardware specs are awesome, but it get’s better still. The LoPy is really easy to use, because we have written a powerful and intuitive IDE – the Pymakr to make it even easier for you to program in your browser and load straight to the LoPy (read on for more information on Pymakr).
Pymakr connects automatically to your WiPy or LoPy via the serial or Telnet Server, runs your code on the fly, manages the internal file system, synchronizes your code instantly and runs it with just one click. It also takes care of firmware upgrades and includes a built in console that interfaces with the MicroPython REPL. Features code completion, static analysis, PEP8 style checking and a built-in interactive prompt.

Pymakr is the one and only tool you'll ever need to develop on the WiPy and LoPy.
PyMakr will be open source and we will release it right after the campaign is finished.
LoPy will also be compatible with THE ARDUINO IDE.





MicroPython forumWiPy DocumentationContact Pycom: support@pycom.io
IMPORTANT NOTE: You need to make sure you have an antenna kit and a power supply to be able to make the LoPy work. The antenna kits we supply are outlined above but you can also source your own.
ANOTHER ALSO IMPORTANT NOTE: LoPy backers will be offered 4 months of FREE use of the IBM Bluemix Binomium platform after shipment in August 2016.







There are loads of cool stuff you can build with the LoPy. Here’s a few examples of what you’d need.



Need an Alarm for a remote shed?





or need to monitor your pet frog?





...and how about a remote light switch for those dark nights?





Or a remote control for your robot butler?


And there’s tons more to do. You have the choice of three different types of wireless networks which means it’s really easy to connect to your home WiFi, your mobile phone or a city or country-wide LoRa Network. 
Here's an example of an IP64 LoPy enclosure unit with the external antenna Kit. All these items will be available for sale on the Pycom webshop.



IP64 enclosure with LoPy, expansion board and antenna kit...and lid.


Your imagination is the only limit.





What is LoRa? 
LoRa is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) specification intended for wireless battery operated Things. LoRaWAN meets the key requirements of Internet of Things such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility and localization services. This standard will provide seamless interoperability among smart Things without the need for complex local installations and gives back the freedom to the user, developer, businesses enabling the role out of Internet of Things.
Public Networks are being rolled out across the globe by organisations such as SENET (USA), ThingsNetwork (Europe and USA), TATA (India), KPN (Europe), Bouygues (France), Swisscom, Proximus  and in addition to that there are a number of private LoRa networks being set up including some run by main universities. 
The benefits of LPWAN is that it is specifically designed for M2M and able to reach devices in remote areas, indoors or underground, with a long battery life – often over 10 years from a single AA battery.
Oh… and did we say we have friends? From our side, we have teamed up with a few network providers and joined the LoRa Alliance to achieve certification for the LoPy. 



Yes, it's official, we joined.


For instance, we found a company as passionate as ourselves, SENET, based out of Boston, USA. In fact, they are so keen to support our developer community that they have agreed for each Pycom developer to connect (free of charge for non commercial applications) 2 LoPy devices onto their networks! At present they have deployed over 100,000 square miles of network coverage across the US with concentrations in the Northeast, the Midwest, and California.  During 2016, network deployment will continue on an aggressive pace including deep coverage in the innovation districts of greater Boston and the San Francisco Bay area.





So if you are lucky enough to live in those regions then try connecting to the Senet network! 

Elsewhere, you can connect to the OpenSource network “The Things Network” whom also happen to be Dutch…. They have/will have coverage in the following cities: 
Sao Paolo (Brazil), Cape Town (South Africa), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Kochi (India), Port of Rotterdam / Rotterdam / Amsterdam / Flevoland/ Groningen / Eindhoven / Friesland / Den Haag / Utrecht / Maastricht (Holland), Zurich (Switzerland), Poznan (Poland), Montreal / Ottawa / Kanata (Canada),  Montevideo (Uruguay), Perth (Australia), Mexico City (Mexico), Belfast (Ireland), Austin / Boston (US), Milan (Italy), Johannesburg (South Africa), Huesca (Spain), Copenhagen (Denmark), Dunedin (New Zealand), and Thatcham / Calderdale / Manchester (UK). 
And if you live elsewhere… be a NEIGHBORHOOD Hero and use your LoPy as the LoRa nano gateway to see how many ‘Things’ you can connect in a 5KM radius! Mmmhhh could be a nice little competition here… more on that later in the year.

The IoT Wear is an extension for regular home (it is not restricted to home) devices that turns them to smart devices connected to the internet. The Infinite Frame Lamp is controlled using one of those IoT Wear controllers.</p><p> It is extremely important for us that this campaign succeed because that is the complete minimum for the development of the IF Lamp, in the first place and than IoT Wear controllers as a independent device, in the second. Without your help it would be very difficult. If this campaign succeed, after we deliver the lamps, our plan is to upgrade the lamp controller to this, much powerful IoT wear devices.

But, that is just what is interesting in research.</p><p>After some time of trying we managed to do the mind control. This was possible because both of the devices, the Infinite Frame and MindWave Mobile, are constructed in that way that they can be easily connected to any other available device. You just need to have a little bit of programming skills.</p><p>Maybe in the video it is not clear enough what we are doing here. We are controlling the lamp by reading the attention level and the level of meditation that MindWave can read. If the attention level goes below some predefined value on the lamp is shown a sad face, and if the attention level is above that level, the Infinite Frame shows a smile face. So, this could be really interesting for the classroom. The professor could monitor the attention level of the troubled student and the lamp could inform him about the current state. :)</p><p>The whole communication scheme looks like this:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/488544/files/20140406165120-mindwaveIFLamp_kick.png?1396828280"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>The Infinite frame lamp - light of the future</b></p><p>The time has come to adapt all devices we use to our needs in such a way we even couldn’t imagine few years ago. We live in a time of M2M systems and Internet of Things progress. It is a very exciting time for the developers and researchers. It is estimated that over 50 billion of devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020. The IF lamp is one of those smart devices that uses the opportunities that modern technology (IoT) provides us. Additionally, the IF lamp is beautifully designed. The light used by the lamp represents Led lighting technology, the most energy-efficient light that exist. Having the possibility of choosing any of the 16 million colors, this product can offer you any light- appearance you like. Furthermore, with 36W Led lights, you’ll have enough room brightness.</p><p><b>Connection to the Internet</b></p><p>One of the most important things that characterizes our lamp is its ability of the Internet connection. The Infinite Frame has a Wi-Fi interface that enables Internet connectivity as well as a DHCP server that enables direct communication between the lamp and other devices, in case local area network is not available. We have a HTTP server running on the lamp that allows easy communication at the application level of IP stack. But, as we are the research team on the first place, we are testing some other possibilities, like CoAP server that uses UDP protocol on the link layer of the IP stack and CoAP protocol on the application layer. Connection to the Internet (when you start the lamp for the first time) is very easy, with the help of our short and simple instruction for setting up your home Wi-Fi network. After connection is set, there are many options available, either using your PC, Smartphone or Tablet. This functionality provides the possibility to control the lamp via the Internet. So, you can set up the atmosphere in the room in the simplest way. With lot of the web services available on the Internet our lamp can use many cool stuff, such as weather forecast, live score of your favorite team, mail, Facebook and Twitter notifications, exchange rates, and many more.</p><p><b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b></p><p>Over the past few years, the Internet of Things has emerged as one of the most interesting concept of the Future Internet. Enabling a range of new applications, it is based on constrained networks, i.e. networks of devices with limited computing, memory and energy capabilities. Typical constrained devices are characterized by severe limits on throughput, available power, and particularly on the complexity that can be supported with limited code size and limited RAM per node. The Internet of Things is foreseen as direction in which all technological progress will move toward in order to provide novel application scenarios.</p><p>Although IF Lamp is not limited with computational power and memory and it is assumed that the energy is not the problem, the IF Lamp is a proper IoT device.</p><p>During the IoT day in Belgrade, on the 09.04.2013, the IF Lamp is presented as one of the interesting IoT device.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/488550/files/20140406165519-IOT3Manja.jpg?1396828519"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>We represented here the connection between, one also very popular device, MindWave Mobile and the Infinite Frame.</p><p><a href=""http://pcpress.rs/internet-of-things-dan-u-beogradu/%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://pcpress.rs/internet-of-things-dan-u-beogradu/</a></p><p><b>Hardware</b></p><p>For our prototype version we have used ARM based Linux computer to control the lamp. Our choice at the moment is Raspberry Pi, but we keep the option open to introduce some similar platform in our final product, because the production of such platforms is very popular and there is a possibility that some better and cheaper platform appears by the end of the campaign. At the moment, we have a microphone and temperature sensors connected to the board, but adding a new sensor is a very simple process. As a matter of fact, at the moment we are working on connection of the lamp with additional sensors, such as proximity sensor, presence sensor and so on. We've left open the option of adding the additional sensors for advanced users.</p><p><b>Software</b></p><p>We have a REST Web Server running on the Linux embedded platform that enables control over the net. It is written in Python language. Also, we have made our C and Python software for the IF Lamp usage. The code is written to be lightweight and modular in order to be able to add or remove some functionalities without influencing the other parts of the code. Because this is a REST web server, it allows as easy adding new interfaces.</p><p><b>Application</b></p><p>Fully featured FREE IF Lamp app, designed by our team, will be available on the Google Play and iTunes. Using the IF Lamp app, you will be able to set many different modes for the lamp. You’ll be able to set the color for entire lamp, set the color for every specific field, dim the light, run some cool widgets (that shows current temperature, runs the VU meter that follows the music rhythm, use the stroboscope, use timer, counter and alarm, etc), show pictures (with possibilities to zoom in some part of the picture), define favorites, use predefined color mix, use predefined animations (starry night, light show, etc), play some simple games (like Tic Tac Toe or puzzle) and similar things.</p><p><b>Web Platform</b></p><p>The Web Platform gathers community of the IF Lamp and, beside possibility to connect to some cool custom web services with the Lamp, it provides the opportunity to share idea about the IF Lamp’s pictures. There are a number of web services that anyone could use and connect to them with the Lamp, like weather forecast, score of your best team match, exchange Rates, world time and many more. The IF Lamp provides the opportunity to share and exchange ideas about your lamp. You can set some cool color mix on your lamp and share that with the IF community. So, if you like some picture, you just download it to your phone and project it on the IF Lamp. We are expecting from you to give us some new and good ideas about how to build a better and nicer lamp.</p><p><b>Beautiful design</b></p><p>While developing the design for IF lamp we followed the philosophy of minimalism. We consider that the simple geometric forms are the best solutions for the product that provides a number of technical possibilities. It’s not necessary that the chassis has complicated shape, because the best way for this technology to come to the fore is by simple and light forms. The fact that the lighting mode gives desired characteristics to the lamp is the reason why it fits anywhere. Of course, this lamp is designed to be simple for turning on (plug and play) and to be easily placed on the wall.</p><p><b>What can you do with IF Lamp?</b></p><ul>

<p></p></div>","Short SummaryThe Infinite Frame is the lamp that helps setting the appropriate atmosphere in the room by simply using your iPhone or Android phone.The Infinite Frame is the smart IoT Lamp designed and developed by the small group of people who enjoy working with modern technologies. In our group there are 10 people mostly with engineer background.Since this is a long term project, here you can see our first commercial attempt :)  First commercialThe Infinite Frame is a part of the much larger picture that we are working on,  the IoT wear for devices. The IoT Wear is an extension for regular home (it is not restricted to home) devices that turns them to smart devices connected to the internet. The Infinite Frame Lamp is controlled using one of those IoT Wear controllers. It is extremely important for us that this campaign succeed because that is the complete minimum for the development of the IF Lamp, in the first place and than IoT Wear controllers as a independent device, in the second. Without your help it would be very difficult. If this campaign succeed, after we deliver the lamps, our plan is to upgrade the lamp controller to this, much powerful IoT wear devices. And of course, you, our helpers will be the first one who will be informed and provided with this upgrade.   The Infinite FrameSet the ambient in the roomWith The Infinite Frame you can easily set up any atmosphere you like in the room and just enjoy..Use the smart phone to set the color on the lamp or to project any picture.Do the Harlem Shake:)Infinite Frame + MindWave Mobile (The NeuroSky device)This task was very challenging for our team because, like almost every other people on this planet, we think that mind control represent state of the art in IT industry. But, that is just what is interesting in research.After some time of trying we managed to do the mind control. This was possible because both of the devices, the Infinite Frame and MindWave Mobile, are constructed in that way that they can be easily connected to any other available device. You just need to have a little bit of programming skills.Maybe in the video it is not clear enough what we are doing here. We are controlling the lamp by reading the attention level and the level of meditation that MindWave can read. If the attention level goes below some predefined value on the lamp is shown a sad face, and if the attention level is above that level, the Infinite Frame shows a smile face. So, this could be really interesting for the classroom. The professor could monitor the attention level of the troubled student and the lamp could inform him about the current state. :)The whole communication scheme looks like this:The Infinite frame lamp - light of the futureThe time has come to adapt all devices we use to our needs in such a way we even couldn’t imagine few years ago. We live in a time of M2M systems and Internet of Things progress. It is a very exciting time for the developers and researchers. It is estimated that over 50 billion of devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020. The IF lamp is one of those smart devices that uses the opportunities that modern technology (IoT) provides us. Additionally, the IF lamp is beautifully designed. The light used by the lamp represents Led lighting technology, the most energy-efficient light that exist. Having the possibility of choosing any of the 16 million colors, this product can offer you any light- appearance you like. Furthermore, with 36W Led lights, you’ll have enough room brightness.Connection to the InternetOne of the most important things that characterizes our lamp is its ability of the Internet connection. The Infinite Frame has a Wi-Fi interface that enables Internet connectivity as well as a DHCP server that enables direct communication between the lamp and other devices, in case local area network is not available. We have a HTTP server running on the lamp that allows easy communication at the application level of IP stack. But, as we are the research team on the first place, we are testing some other possibilities, like CoAP server that uses UDP protocol on the link layer of the IP stack and CoAP protocol on the application layer. Connection to the Internet (when you start the lamp for the first time) is very easy, with the help of our short and simple instruction for setting up your home Wi-Fi network. After connection is set, there are many options available, either using your PC, Smartphone or Tablet. This functionality provides the possibility to control the lamp via the Internet. So, you can set up the atmosphere in the room in the simplest way. With lot of the web services available on the Internet our lamp can use many cool stuff, such as weather forecast, live score of your favorite team, mail, Facebook and Twitter notifications, exchange rates, and many more.Internet of Things (IoT)Over the past few years, the Internet of Things has emerged as one of the most interesting concept of the Future Internet. Enabling a range of new applications, it is based on constrained networks, i.e. networks of devices with limited computing, memory and energy capabilities. Typical constrained devices are characterized by severe limits on throughput, available power, and particularly on the complexity that can be supported with limited code size and limited RAM per node. The Internet of Things is foreseen as direction in which all technological progress will move toward in order to provide novel application scenarios.Although IF Lamp is not limited with computational power and memory and it is assumed that the energy is not the problem, the IF Lamp is a proper IoT device.During the IoT day in Belgrade, on the 09.04.2013, the IF Lamp is presented as one of the interesting IoT device.We represented here the connection between, one also very popular device, MindWave Mobile and the Infinite Frame.http://pcpress.rs/internet-of-things-dan-u-beogradu/HardwareFor our prototype version we have used ARM based Linux computer to control the lamp. Our choice at the moment is Raspberry Pi, but we keep the option open to introduce some similar platform in our final product, because the production of such platforms is very popular and there is a possibility that some better and cheaper platform appears by the end of the campaign. At the moment, we have a microphone and temperature sensors connected to the board, but adding a new sensor is a very simple process. As a matter of fact, at the moment we are working on connection of the lamp with additional sensors, such as proximity sensor, presence sensor and so on. We've left open the option of adding the additional sensors for advanced users.SoftwareWe have a REST Web Server running on the Linux embedded platform that enables control over the net. It is written in Python language. Also, we have made our C and Python software for the IF Lamp usage. The code is written to be lightweight and modular in order to be able to add or remove some functionalities without influencing the other parts of the code. Because this is a REST web server, it allows as easy adding new interfaces.ApplicationFully featured FREE IF Lamp app, designed by our team, will be available on the Google Play and iTunes. Using the IF Lamp app, you will be able to set many different modes for the lamp. You’ll be able to set the color for entire lamp, set the color for every specific field, dim the light, run some cool widgets (that shows current temperature, runs the VU meter that follows the music rhythm, use the stroboscope, use timer, counter and alarm, etc), show pictures (with possibilities to zoom in some part of the picture), define favorites, use predefined color mix, use predefined animations (starry night, light show, etc), play some simple games (like Tic Tac Toe or puzzle) and similar things.Web PlatformThe Web Platform gathers community of the IF Lamp and, beside possibility to connect to some cool custom web services with the Lamp, it provides the opportunity to share idea about the IF Lamp’s pictures. There are a number of web services that anyone could use and connect to them with the Lamp, like weather forecast, score of your best team match, exchange Rates, world time and many more. The IF Lamp provides the opportunity to share and exchange ideas about your lamp. You can set some cool color mix on your lamp and share that with the IF community. So, if you like some picture, you just download it to your phone and project it on the IF Lamp. We are expecting from you to give us some new and good ideas about how to build a better and nicer lamp.Beautiful designWhile developing the design for IF lamp we followed the philosophy of minimalism. We consider that the simple geometric forms are the best solutions for the product that provides a number of technical possibilities. It’s not necessary that the chassis has complicated shape, because the best way for this technology to come to the fore is by simple and light forms. The fact that the lighting mode gives desired characteristics to the lamp is the reason why it fits anywhere. Of course, this lamp is designed to be simple for turning on (plug and play) and to be easily placed on the wall.What can you do with IF Lamp?

simply helps you and your phone to stay together. </p>
<p>Today, I work for an FMCG company for a living – but as I got tired of
either losing my phone or being generally scared to do so, I came up with
CLINCH. In my opinion, it offers an easy solution to make sure your phone is

<p>Raspberry Pi’s are fantastic – but when you want to use them in a standalone application that requires some kind of display and a keyboard with maybe some extra USB ports and access to the LAN port then things can get a bit messy.</p>
<p>You'll need to find a housing and a display and figure out some way to keep everything connected and hide all the wires and decide where to store the keyboard when it’s not being used and then how to keep all the various power supplies for the Pi, the display, the speaker amp and the USB hub from being unplugged three months down the line.</p>
<p>And this often ends up looking like the pictures below.</p>

<p>There are a number of great looking housings on the market but nothing that is specifically designed to house your Pi and make it look like a finished, all in one desktop style product with a built in screen, keyboard and speakers and access to the communication connectors that Pi provides.</p>
<p>Imagine then your Pi, almost as an appliance, standing on a desktop or counter. It’s beautiful and neat in white and grey with a brilliant 7” (800 x 480) HDMI LCD display angled perfectly for viewing.</p>
<p>It is unobtrusive but big enough - the size of an open A5 booklet with the screen filling the top half and the spill proof and washable keyboard filling the bottom half.</p>
<p>It’s your energy monitor or your home automation system, your internet of things manager or your ZX Spectrum, your media player or games console, the instant messaging device that you give to your parents, or your weather station, or pretty much everything else that a Pi can be.

</div></div>","The ultimate house for Pi 
Raspberry Pi’s are fantastic – but when you want to use them in a standalone application that requires some kind of display and a keyboard with maybe some extra USB ports and access to the LAN port then things can get a bit messy.
You'll need to find a housing and a display and figure out some way to keep everything connected and hide all the wires and decide where to store the keyboard when it’s not being used and then how to keep all the various power supplies for the Pi, the display, the speaker amp and the USB hub from being unplugged three months down the line.
And this often ends up looking like the pictures below.


There are a number of great looking housings on the market but nothing that is specifically designed to house your Pi and make it look like a finished, all in one desktop style product with a built in screen, keyboard and speakers and access to the communication connectors that Pi provides.
Imagine then your Pi, almost as an appliance, standing on a desktop or counter. It’s beautiful and neat in white and grey with a brilliant 7” (800 x 480) HDMI LCD display angled perfectly for viewing.
It is unobtrusive but big enough - the size of an open A5 booklet with the screen filling the top half and the spill proof and washable keyboard filling the bottom half.
It’s your energy monitor or your home automation system, your internet of things manager or your ZX Spectrum, your media player or games console, the instant messaging device that you give to your parents, or your weather station, or pretty much everything else that a Pi can be. And now on top of it – it’s really nicely packaged too.


PiKasa is the ultimate Pi housing that can be used initially for Pi versions 1 and 2 and the A, B and B+ versions of these and in our next release, also for the Pi Compute module.

So how does it work ?
PiKasa is a really high quality injection molded ABS housing that has the following already fitted :



7” (800 x 480) colour TFT LCD with HDMI interface


Keyboard with a splash proof silicon rubber keymat overlay and 4 hotkeys aligned to the screen


Interconnect board that has a built in 12v to 5v power converter, Li-ion battery charger, USB hub (to give you 5 external USB ports), LAN hookup, audio hookup with onboard amplifier and loudspeakers, Raspberry Pi power hookup and HDMI interface circuitry to drive the LCD


Carrier bracket to hold your Raspberry Pi inside the housing


All you need to do to get your PiKasa powered up is connect the internal cables on the interconnect board to your Raspberry Pi, press fit your Pi onto the internal HDMI connector and fit two holding screws to retain the Pi in the correct position. 


Then replace the back cover, connect power and switch on the device at the integrated power switch and your Pi is an instant appliance, running whichever applications you have loaded on your SD card.

What we need and What you get
 We need to upgrade the LCD technology and hardware platform of one of our exisitng products that we deploy to provide content and controlled internet services to schools in South Africa.
To be able to do this we need to be able to afford the tooling changes needed to the injection molding tools as well as the implementation of the new hardware platform for all the content that is now available.
By creating PiKasa, we hope to be able to get the support needed to make these changes and at the same time be able to offer a really nice, world first product to the Raspberry Pi community.


Our perks are all based around the Pikasa product and we are offering some really fantastic discounts for everyone that jumps in early to support us.

So how did this come about ?
 
For the last few years we have been deploying a product into some South African schools that we call Streetwise. Have a look at www.thecontentcompany.co.za for some ideas on what we have been doing.
The technology that we developed about 5 years ago was developed in my previous company which sadly had to shut down just as Streetwise was almost ready to launch. I took over the IP and the product and my small team completed the development that was needed to launch the product into the market where it has been used very successfully at a small number of schools around the country.

If we can get enough support for our Pikasa project then not only will we be able to afford the tooling changes needed to bring this great housing to the market, but we will also be able to upgrade the technology in our Streetwise product and take this great educational project to the next level.This means that the potential impact of this project is huge, not only for the Pi community but also for the 20,000 plus schools in South Africa that have zero connectivity to the internet or the great educational content freely available.The state of play
We have built a working prototype in order to prove the concept and test that everything can be fitted into the housing as anticipated.

We have also been able to confirm the appropriateness of the 7” LCD and check that it provides a great display quality in terminal mode as well as when running a full graphical interface (OS or Application).


The changes needed for the tooling have all been designed in principle and have been discussed with our tooling and plastics manufacturing partner in Hong Kong (we have a 10 year working relationship with them).
We have selected a partner to work with for the supply of the LCD and we have sourced the HDMI controller circuitry and components needed for integration onto our PCB.

And lastly we have designed the changes needed to our current keyboard PCB  and sourced the components required for it to operate as a standard USB device.

Timing and Challenges
 The campaign will end around the middle of April 2015 and if we are successful then we intend to immediately start implementing the hardware design of the PiKasa interconnect PCB (that the Raspberry Pi will be fitted to) and the changes needed to the injection molding tools for the new LCD.

 
We have a lot of experience with taking products through the development and manufacturing process over the past 25 years and we do not expect any problems with this project, although the timeline is tight and does not cater for any unforseen delays.

The screen is too small. At the very least it should be able to accomodate A4-size documents without scaling them down.
It is not very convenient for tablets to exchange files with desktop or laptop PCs. Many file formats are not supported by tablets. Sending documents back and forth via the cloud does take a considerable time.
The tablet can hardly be used as a desktop replacement. Connecting various peripherals to the tablet is not easy.
We, Gembird Europe, have designed our tablet, trying to address these issues...Some Like It BIG!Our tablet has a large 13.3"" screen (with resolution of 1600 x 900 pixels). A4-size documents can fit this screen entirely without having to be scaled down. And of course browsing Internet or watching videos also involves much less zoom and scroll, zoom and scroll...FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions):Q: How heavy is the tablet?A: This tablet is just over 1 kg (net weight).  Q: In the video I have seen that A4-size document fits the screen vertically but not quite horizontally?A: Indeed the screen is a little bit narrower than the A4-size. However our software is able to remove the empty margins from the document sides automatically. The document then does not have to be scaled down at all to fit on the screen. E-printer FunctionE-printer function was first introduced by us for an e-Ink screen device and won an innovation award at CES Las-Vegas in 2012. More international awards followed... What is E-printer function?
Connect our tablet to any PC or MAC and it will be recognized as a printer.
Print afterwards any document (or send any file using context menu) with wired connection or wirelessly. Note: the colors of the original document will be preserved in the printout.
Make remarks on the document on the tablet.
Send the document back and it would appear on the managing computer.
What are the advantages of E-printer function?
E-printer is useful for any business process where the paper is used to storeinformation for a limited period of time. It is then a ready solution for this process which does not require any changes in existing software etc.
E-printer is especially useful for checklists, proofreading and business meetings.
E-printer would bring savings both in printing costs (cartridges, paper) and processing time (printing goes much faster).
E-printer is a green paperless solution.
FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions):Q: Is E-printer some kind of app?A: Actually it is not. The tablet is recognized by any PC or MAC as a printer, on a hardware level. This is achieved by our own, customized Android kernel. Of course we supply drivers for PC and MAC and some printout management/editing apps as well. Q: I understand that I can always print my documents onto the tablet but what if I need to transfer the original file? Should I still use the cloud?A: No, you can use the context (right mouse button) menu on your computer to send an orbitrary file to the tablet. Just choose the option Send to E-printer from the menu and the file will appear in the Document Manager on the tablet. If your tablet is connected to the computer, then the file will be transferred via the USB cable, otherwise the document will be sent via the cloud. In any case no more handling will be required from you. Note: with E-printer software you can keep using the tablet when it is connected to your computer.Q: What if I wish to transfer the file from the tablet back to my PC? How do I do that?A: Just use the scanner icon in the Document Manager on your tablet. Again, the file would travel either via the USB cable or wirelessly. A pop-up window on your PC will then contain the returned file to let you save or process it.Docking StationWith our docking station the tablet can be transformed into a full desktop PC within a flash. The handle at the back of the docking station can be turned to place the tablet horizontally...or vertically... Just pre-wire your favorite connections to the docking station, slide the tablet in and you are done!FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions):Q: Will I be able to charge the tablet in the docking station as well?A: Yes, just connect your power supply to the docking station in advance. In the docking station the tablet will be charged much faster than without it (since it is using fast-charge connectors then).Android TabletJust like any ordinary tablet our product will let you browse the Internet, watch videos and play games. Empowered with Android 4.1 operating system you will be able to download and use thousands of apps. With G-sensor the screen orientation will be automatically adjusted to desktop or landscape mode as you turn the tablet.Use two cameras (front and rear) to take photos or make Skype calls.The USB connector will allow you to either connect your tablet to a desktop or laptop PC (it will then be recognized as a printer) or attach other USB peripherals (directly or via a hub) to the tablet. Note: Bluetooth devices can also be used with this tablet.MicroSD card would allow you to increase the storage capacity of your tablet (with up to 32GBs).With HDMI connector you will be able to connect your tablet to a TV set.Use earphone connector to attach your favorite headset. There are built-in microphone and speaker as well.Power charging connectors would help you speed up charging of your tablet.How do you plan to update Android to the newer releases?FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions):Q: How do you plan to update Android to the newer releases?A: Together with the tablet we supply software (for PC and MAC). This software regularly checks our server for updates. Once a new update becomes available, we publish it on our server. The software then downloads the update, informs the user and, if allowed, transfers the update to the tablet where it gets installed automatically. The software updates itself in a similar fashion. Handwriting & DrawingWe deliberately designed the touch panel of our tablet to be of a very high-resolution. With the active, high-precision stylus (supplied with Advanced and Professional models) you will be able to make full use of the big screen for handwriting or drawing purposes.BatteryGiven that our tablet is quite big, we were able to accomodate a decent capacity battery - 12000mAh. FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions):Q: What is the battery life( while in use)?A: The battery will last for at least 8 hours when used intensively and up to 25 days in sleep mode. Q: How long would it take to fully charge the battery?A: With our product we supply a 3A power adapter, the time to fully charge (from 0% to more than 90%) the tablet with this charger (with or without the docking station) is around 5-6 hours.SpecificationsAmong the contribution options we listed Standard, Advanced and Professional models.

</div>
<div><h3>
<br/>Why am I doing this?</h3></div> <p></p>
<p>Having recently arrived into the raspberry pi scene and finding it very enjoyable, I was finding myself not too thrilled with the case selection available for the current Raspberry Pi B+ model.  Nearly all of the readily available, non-back-ordered cases were plastic, and produced overseas.  This caused me to question the material quality (let alone safety of the material used and potentially non-disclosed) for those cases.  The other option being D.I.Y. projects coming off of someone's 3D printer, which again brings into question durability, and results in production number capacity vs. orders issued, again resulting in a delay.<br/></p>
<p>Given my background in CNC &amp; Sheet metal fabrication (details below), I was finally fed up enough to design and produce my own case!  The community truly needs not only a case that is visually beautiful, but that is also cost effective<b> </b>as well as being produced with quality metal right here in the United States.<br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What makes this a project doable?</h3>
<p>I have nearly 5 year experience in CNC &amp; Sheet metal fabrication as a Production and Quality Control Manager.  Our experience and reputation in the Commercial, Medical and Aerospace Industries is vast and highly regarded.  Also, I'm not some machine operator trying to squeeze parts after-hours or on my break to make a quick buck.  In my role at the company, I control the production tasks and quality control. <br/><br/>This project is being processed just as a standard customer order run would be and will be given hands on by almost the entire staff.  I have the support of a full machining and sheetmetal shop with over 100 yrs combined experience, ready and at my disposal for both prototyping and mass manufacturing of this project.<br/><br/></p>

<h3>What makes this venture different than similar crowd-funded projects?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Most CNC approaches to this type of application that we've seen utilize 1, or a small number of manual drills and manual CNC milling machines. While there is nothing wrong with this approach, it is very time consuming and drags out production times while also lowering the ability to repeat quality production runs. <br/><br/>My design will be run on Computerized CNC milling machines.  This means significantly faster production times, in larger quantities, with unquestioned ability to achieve the highest quality in each and every batch.<br/><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The target sales price for this case is $40.00 USD plus shipping and handling.</p>
<p>If there is one truth in CNC manufacturing, it is that if the quantity of parts per batch in your runs is not large, the price increases exponentially.  Larger quantity per batch equals lower per-piece cost.<br/></p>
<p>Given that rule,  in order to start this project, the following requirements must be met:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>The full amount of funding has to be met in order to cover the manufacturing costs of this case in a large enough quantity to satisfy the truth explained above.<br/>
</li> <li>Higher demand for the case will result in a even higher chance of longer runs and repeat runs funded independently by myself to ensure availability after the needs of the indiegogo campaign is met to make sure everyone can get one of these cases if they want one in the future.<br/><br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact on local job market</h3> <p>Successfully funding this project will provide a benefit to the local manufacturing community here in California.  None of the funds will be used for anything other than the production of the case.<br/></p>
<p>Computers, Engineering services, Design services, Blueprinting Services, RPI B+ units, and prototype runs have already been accounted for and covered by myself long ago. I am volunteering my ""personal"" time that has been contributed to  getting this project going without compensation, and will never seek any compensation from the project funding.<br/></p>
<p>During the production time of the case, you will directly cause the following effects in my home town:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Ensure employment and optional over-time availability for at least 10-20 factory workers in my shop that are living in Southern California.<br/>
</li> <li>Ensure employment for an additional 5-10 factory works at the anodizing facility these parts will be sent to.</li> <li>Slightly enhance the local economy in my town as well as generating a small amount of needed tax dollars for the local area<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This campaign is to avoid personal financial risk.  $5,000 is a lot of out of pocket expenses for a sole individual on a single income, without any surety that I will see any of it back.  Using ingiegogo provides insurance not only to myself, but because the project will not start if the full goal is not met, it also provides insurance to you:  you will not be charged if it is not successfully (fully) funded.<br/></p>
<p>Only additional challenges foreseen will be production lead time, and international shipping.</p>
<p>- Lead Time will be heavily impacted by the demand for this case, low demand will result in longer lead times. If I have a large demand for this case then lead times will be much lower as the funding for any needed rush processing would be readily available.</p>
<p>- International Shipping will be a challenge as I will need to work with a local shipping facility to accomplish this as it is a large task for any one person, at lease to start out. If this campaign is indeed funded fully International Shipping will be a reality. Otherwise I will need to work with a reseller to make this happen.</p>

</li> </ul>
</div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Raspberry Pi B+ is Awesome! Now we need an Awesome Case!

How about a case made of solid aerospace-grade aluminium? Sounds good.What if we made it black instead of silver or bare metal? Sounds better.What if it was anodized to help protect the metal, prevent paint chipping, and prevent corrosion?This is sounding great!What if the case features two built-in heatsinks to dissipate heat from the two main processing chips on the RPiB+ board?It just keeps getting better!What if it secures everything in place, and finishes off with 4 beautiful stainless steel screws to contrast the slick black anodized coloring to make it presentable?Awesome!What if we designed, manufactured, and assembled the case right here in the USA?How could this possibly get any better?What if this was all a reality thanks to your backing & support?That would be incredible, wouldn't it? 


Why am I doing this? 
Having recently arrived into the raspberry pi scene and finding it very enjoyable, I was finding myself not too thrilled with the case selection available for the current Raspberry Pi B+ model.  Nearly all of the readily available, non-back-ordered cases were plastic, and produced overseas.  This caused me to question the material quality (let alone safety of the material used and potentially non-disclosed) for those cases.  The other option being D.I.Y. projects coming off of someone's 3D printer, which again brings into question durability, and results in production number capacity vs. orders issued, again resulting in a delay.
Given my background in CNC & Sheet metal fabrication (details below), I was finally fed up enough to design and produce my own case!  The community truly needs not only a case that is visually beautiful, but that is also cost effective as well as being produced with quality metal right here in the United States.

What makes this a project doable?
I have nearly 5 year experience in CNC & Sheet metal fabrication as a Production and Quality Control Manager.  Our experience and reputation in the Commercial, Medical and Aerospace Industries is vast and highly regarded.  Also, I'm not some machine operator trying to squeeze parts after-hours or on my break to make a quick buck.  In my role at the company, I control the production tasks and quality control. This project is being processed just as a standard customer order run would be and will be given hands on by almost the entire staff.  I have the support of a full machining and sheetmetal shop with over 100 yrs combined experience, ready and at my disposal for both prototyping and mass manufacturing of this project.



What makes this venture different than similar crowd-funded projects?

Most CNC approaches to this type of application that we've seen utilize 1, or a small number of manual drills and manual CNC milling machines. While there is nothing wrong with this approach, it is very time consuming and drags out production times while also lowering the ability to repeat quality production runs. My design will be run on Computerized CNC milling machines.  This means significantly faster production times, in larger quantities, with unquestioned ability to achieve the highest quality in each and every batch.
   What We Need & What You Get The target sales price for this case is $40.00 USD plus shipping and handling.
If there is one truth in CNC manufacturing, it is that if the quantity of parts per batch in your runs is not large, the price increases exponentially.  Larger quantity per batch equals lower per-piece cost.
Given that rule,  in order to start this project, the following requirements must be met: 
The full amount of funding has to be met in order to cover the manufacturing costs of this case in a large enough quantity to satisfy the truth explained above.
 Higher demand for the case will result in a even higher chance of longer runs and repeat runs funded independently by myself to ensure availability after the needs of the indiegogo campaign is met to make sure everyone can get one of these cases if they want one in the future.
 
  The Impact on local job market Successfully funding this project will provide a benefit to the local manufacturing community here in California.  None of the funds will be used for anything other than the production of the case.
Computers, Engineering services, Design services, Blueprinting Services, RPI B+ units, and prototype runs have already been accounted for and covered by myself long ago. I am volunteering my ""personal"" time that has been contributed to  getting this project going without compensation, and will never seek any compensation from the project funding.
During the production time of the case, you will directly cause the following effects in my home town: 
Ensure employment and optional over-time availability for at least 10-20 factory workers in my shop that are living in Southern California.
 Ensure employment for an additional 5-10 factory works at the anodizing facility these parts will be sent to. Slightly enhance the local economy in my town as well as generating a small amount of needed tax dollars for the local area


  Risks & Challenges This campaign is to avoid personal financial risk.  $5,000 is a lot of out of pocket expenses for a sole individual on a single income, without any surety that I will see any of it back.  Using ingiegogo provides insurance not only to myself, but because the project will not start if the full goal is not met, it also provides insurance to you:  you will not be charged if it is not successfully (fully) funded.
Only additional challenges foreseen will be production lead time, and international shipping.
- Lead Time will be heavily impacted by the demand for this case, low demand will result in longer lead times. If I have a large demand for this case then lead times will be much lower as the funding for any needed rush processing would be readily available.
- International Shipping will be a challenge as I will need to work with a local shipping facility to accomplish this as it is a large task for any one person, at lease to start out. If this campaign is indeed funded fully International Shipping will be a reality. Otherwise I will need to work with a reseller to make this happen.
The Extra Mile - You win!
If full funding for this campaign is reached and/or exceeded before the end of the campaign period I will go the extra mile myself to make everyone extra happy by kicking in the large volume orders to the manufacturing facility with my own funding to get production started early. 
What does this mean for you? 
This means if you contributed enough to reach ""Get 1!"" level or beyond you will have the possibility of seeing a tracking number for your new RPI B+ case shortly after the campaign ends instead of in December like listed.
How serious am I about this?
Lets put it this way.. if this campaign manages to double, triple, quadruple the goal, heck or even exceeds by 10,000%  before it ends. Part will -already- be in production and getting prepaird for shippments -before- the campaign ends.


Bitcoin!Once this Campaign ends I will be accepting payments via traditional processing means. I will also be accepting Bitcoin (BTC) for payment on any size order volume.Yes this means you can become a supplier and purchase with bitcoin as well if the project is successful and we go into full production mode!

<p><b>OS Options</b></p>
<p>The PengPods come with Android and
Linaro installed on flash.  The system will boot by default into Android (initially, this can be changed but Android should be run first to format the shared partition).   The Android install has Google certification and access to
the play store, maps and other typical Android apps you might expect.
 Linaro is a typical LXDE desktop environment backed by the Ubuntu
Arm repositories including LibreOffice, GIMP, Apache, MySQL
and most other mainstream Linux desktop applications.</p>

<p><b>What you can do with your PengPod</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
original PengPods have been used in many diverse applications
including SCADA industrial controls, POS register systems, 3D printer
controls, nurse stations, access control systems, survey equipment,
LAMP servers, GPS navigation systems and more.  With an open
system the possibilities are only limited by your abilities and
imagination.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>An open system protects your freedom as well.  All source for the
Android build is available, not just Linux. You don't have to worry
about what your tablet might be sending behind your back it is all
free to be reviewed, modified and customized to your liking.</p>

<p>This is our second time to market and we are now familiar with the demands of delivering the perks.  Open software is the lifeblood of the PengPod and what makes it so versatile. There are many exciting, evolving touch based Linux platforms we would like to offer with the PengPod. Each of these will require time and effort and with funding we will be able to make more of these available.  <br/></p>
<p>Crowd-funding will allow us to bring on more permanent staff, including at least one full time engineer who will be dedicated to expanding and improving the software options available for the PengPod 1040.<br/></p>

ViewTouch, inventors of the first graphical Point of Sale software back 
in 1986.  They have long been supporters of Linux and take full 
advantage of open source software to keep their register systems both 
feature rich and secure. They contacted us with this offer for two 
reasons.  They share our belief that tablets should be able to run 
unrestricted operating systems, just like we enjoy on our desktops and 
also they worked with our first generation devices and want to help make 
the next generation PengPod 1040 a reality. </span><br/></p>

<br/>We are able to offer 100 PengPod 1040s pre-installed with their ViewTouch 
POS software for a contribution of $495.  Normally this system would 
cost $2000 for the software license and the initial hardware.  
The software does require a monthly use, support and training fee of $29 
to be enabled, typically this fee would be $79 but they have offered to 
discount that as well for a savings of $600 a year.  This is a great chance to support free 
software and acquire a high quality, commercial restaurant POS system for 
less than $500 thanks to our friends at ViewTouch and the power of an 
open system. <br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

What you can do with your PengPod


The
original PengPods have been used in many diverse applications
including SCADA industrial controls, POS register systems, 3D printer
controls, nurse stations, access control systems, survey equipment,
LAMP servers, GPS navigation systems and more.  With an open
system the possibilities are only limited by your abilities and
imagination.


An open system protects your freedom as well.  All source for the
Android build is available, not just Linux. You don't have to worry
about what your tablet might be sending behind your back it is all
free to be reviewed, modified and customized to your liking.
Why we need you
We want to be able to offer PengPod 1040 Tablet with the best software possible, at the best price possible and produce a quality product with an experienced, open source friendly contract manufacturer.  To meet our hardware goals and guarantee quality we need volume.  
This is our second time to market and we are now familiar with the demands of delivering the perks.  Open software is the lifeblood of the PengPod and what makes it so versatile. There are many exciting, evolving touch based Linux platforms we would like to offer with the PengPod. Each of these will require time and effort and with funding we will be able to make more of these available.  
Crowd-funding will allow us to bring on more permanent staff, including at least one full time engineer who will be dedicated to expanding and improving the software options available for the PengPod 1040.

ViewTouch POSWe are pleased to announce a promotion backed by our friends at 
ViewTouch, inventors of the first graphical Point of Sale software back 
in 1986.  They have long been supporters of Linux and take full 
advantage of open source software to keep their register systems both 
feature rich and secure. They contacted us with this offer for two 
reasons.  They share our belief that tablets should be able to run 
unrestricted operating systems, just like we enjoy on our desktops and 
also they worked with our first generation devices and want to help make 
the next generation PengPod 1040 a reality. 

We are able to offer 100 PengPod 1040s pre-installed with their ViewTouch 
POS software for a contribution of $495.  Normally this system would 
cost $2000 for the software license and the initial hardware.  
The software does require a monthly use, support and training fee of $29 
to be enabled, typically this fee would be $79 but they have offered to 
discount that as well for a savings of $600 a year.  This is a great chance to support free 
software and acquire a high quality, commercial restaurant POS system for 
less than $500 thanks to our friends at ViewTouch and the power of an 
open system.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2>What is LunarDock:Io?</h2>
<p>The majority of the population owns a smartphone and personal computer. They have become mainstays in our everyday lives as well as something we largely take for granted. Power it up, push some buttons, get your information, and go about life.</p>
<p>However, the smaller populace of technology enthusiasts that not only demand functionality but also appreciate the aesthetics of their devices are looking for products that are both artistically unique as well as customizable to their individual tastes. We recognize that the Indiegogo community is composed of this select breed of user; therefore, we see this arena as the perfect launching pad for inspired creations like the <strong>LunarDock:Io</strong>...</p>
<h3><img alt=""Blue on table"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/LDIOSilver&amp;Blue1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3><img alt=""Silicon Rubber Bay Pad"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/BayRubber560.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/Orange560-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h2>The LD:Io is both unique and functional</h2>
<p>The LunarDock:Io is the dock charging station for your smartphone. Simply plug it into your computer's USB port, set your phone into the cradle, and it recharges your battery.</p>
<p>In addition to this simple function, we realize that people are increasingly spending an extraordinary amount of time married to their desks and computers. So why not have your workspace accented with accessories that are not only functional but also visually appealing? This is where the LunarDock:Io stands out.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Green on Green"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/greenbubbles560.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3><img alt=""PinkImage"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/Creative1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h2>LunarDock:Io is more than your standard dock</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CNC machined from billet 6061 aircraft quality aluminum.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Durable anodized finish available in matte silver or black.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The LD:Io weighs over 1/2 of a pound.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Silicon rubber is used on both the base and cradle for protection.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-phone support. The LD:Io supports iPhone4/5 and most center-bottom mounted MicroUSB based phones.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oversized docking bay to accommodate most phone cases.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Docking connector is adjustable. Phone plug location can move 1.5mm fore and aft.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>7 degree phone back support and matching phone connector angle.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>And...it's lighted! RGB LEDs add a cool subtle glow in a variety of colors and patterns.</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong> <img alt=""The 13 Colors of LED in the LD:Io"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/LDIOColorwheel560.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></h3>
<p><em><span>The LD:Io allows the owner to select from the following colors: Red, Red-Orange, Orange, Yellow-Orange, Yellow, Lime, Green, Aqua, Indigo, Blue, Violet, Pink or White.</span></em></p>
<p><em><img alt=""Purple Bubbles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/Purple1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p>
<p><em><span>Beyond just displaying a solid color, you can select two colors and have them alternate. You want to show your team pride? Select your colors and let everyone around you know even your LD:Io is a fan of your team.</span> </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<h2>What effects can be selected?</h2>
<p>The LunarDock:Io allows you to display a single selectable color. You can also make that color fade in and out similar to the sleep light on a Macbook. You can also select two colors and have them fade in and out as well. Or for those of you who really want to show off the LD:Io's capabilities, you can let it run in demo mode as seen in the video.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Will my phone work with the LD:Io?</h2>
<p>We will be adding specific models of phones that should work with the LD:Io. There are so many case variables that it makes it almost impossible to say what will and won't fit without measuring each individual phone. Currently, the LD:Io supports the Apple Lightning connector for the iPhone5, the Apple 30 pin connector for the iPhone3/4 and center-bottom mounted MicroUSB. If your connector is directly in the center of the bottom of your phone and is less than 2.71"" wide by .59"" deep, you should have no problem using the LD:Io. If you want to be really safe, make sure your phone dimensions with your case are under 2.6"" wide and .5"" deep.   <img alt=""ConnectorTpyes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/ConnectorTypes560.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Yes, that's right, the LD:Io supports your choice of Apple Lightning, Apple 30 Pin and MicroUSB connections!</em></p>
<p><img alt=""Width"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/Width560.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>The wide docking platform provides enough room to fit most cases.</em></p>
<p><img alt=""Depth"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/Depth560.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img alt=""Adjustable"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/Adjust560.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>The phone connector can be adjusted for those that want the absolute perfect fit to their case.</em></p>
<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<p>What would any crowdfunded project like this be without a mouthwatering stretch goal? We have some juicy LED effects lined up, and once we break the funding goal, we will be posting them. If you want to see how crazy we can get with LEDs, tell a friend and help us not only reach our funding goal but exceed it.</p>
<p>Let's see.... Maybe the first stretch goal will be a nice and bright single color flash.... ON-OFF-ON-OFF nice and fast to really make your coworkers angry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/1-7basepad-dgrey.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>How do I power the LunarDock:Io?</h2>
<p>The LunarDock:Io is powered from a standard USB 5V source. We will include a matching gray MicroUSB to USB ""A"" cable for all the docks that are ordered with either the Apple 30 Pin or MicroUSB phone connector types.</p>
<p>We apologize but Apple iPhone 5 owners will need to provide their own Apple Lightning© cable to power the dock at this time.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Some of the LDIO Colors"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/LDIOCOLORS.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt=""Blueprint3"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/LDIOBlueprint3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Even with the skin off, the LD:Io is a stunning work of art.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""NightLight"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/LDIONightlight.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Besides charging your phone, the LD:Io also works great as a night light to keep monsters at bay. And when you don't want the LED effects, you can always turn them off.</em></p>
<h2>Why are we seeking funding?</h2>
<p>While we have spent a significant amount of time testing and prototyping, manufacturing is expensive. With your support, <strong>LunarDock:Io</strong> will become a reality enabling us to bring this product to market. The LunarDock:Io is just the beginning of the projects we have lined up. This funding will help get a solid start and let us provide a unique product to our supporters.</p>
<p>The materials are already sourced and the suppliers are all in line and ready to go. The only real challenge we have is committing to the tooling setup and molding costs for both the silicon rubber pieces as well as the circuit boards. That is where the Indiegogo fanbase can help us out!</p>
<p>Every dollar helps us get closer to our goal, so even if you can't use the LD:Io for your current phone, a contribution to our project will help us fast track new ideas that will open our creativity to a new audience. Support for off-center MicroUSB phones, large format phones, and even a LunarDock for the iPad and iPad Mini? Yes, we have matching lighted designs all ready for these as well. Your support will not only help get this little gem in full production, but also set the stage for even more creative ideas.</p>

<h3><img alt=""Electronic Circuitry"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/LDIOOsci1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p><em>Much more than simply charging your phone, the LD:Io has its own integrated circuit to give the owner control over the colors and lighting effects.</em></p>
<h3><img alt=""LD:Io ready to receive their electronic circuitry."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lunardockio.com/LDIOonMill.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>

<h2>Risks and Challenges:</h2>
<p>Any new endeavor is not without certain risks and challenges...</p>
<p>LunarDock:Io has significantly more ""moving pieces"" than the average phone dock. We have sorted out most of the logistics with sourcing of material, electronics, and shipping. However, as with any complicated project, coordinating logistics with multiple suppliers can result in delays. We feel communication plays a vital role and our pledge is to always be up-front with our supporters.</p>
<p>The delivery date is intentionally set to April 2013 with the hope that there are no parts sourcing issues that cause us to need that amount of time. We hope nothing will stand in our way to deliver the LD:Io to the supporters as soon as they come together. First ordered - first delivered. We promise to always keep supporters informed about ship dates and when they can expect delivery of their LD:Io. Simply, we vow to treat you the way we want to be treated as a customer.</p>
<h2>How you can help:</h2>
<p>While our goal to make this project a success is a modest $20,000, we appreciate every single contribution you provide to make this a reality. For those who can't spare the cash at this time, you can still help us out. While we would love everyone who visits this site to buy an LD:Io, we would benefit even more by having as many people as we can spread the word about our products on Facebook, Twitter, tech sites, blogs, word of mouth, whatever. The more people that see our creation, the better.</p>

<h2>We appreciate your support!!!</h2>
<p>Thanks for checking out LunarDock:Io! We hope you are as excited as we are! Please be sure to check back often for updates as our project progresses. Also, feel free to contact us with any comments, questions, and suggestions.</p>
</div></div>","What is LunarDock:Io?
The majority of the population owns a smartphone and personal computer. They have become mainstays in our everyday lives as well as something we largely take for granted. Power it up, push some buttons, get your information, and go about life.
However, the smaller populace of technology enthusiasts that not only demand functionality but also appreciate the aesthetics of their devices are looking for products that are both artistically unique as well as customizable to their individual tastes. We recognize that the Indiegogo community is composed of this select breed of user; therefore, we see this arena as the perfect launching pad for inspired creations like the LunarDock:Io...



The LD:Io is both unique and functional
The LunarDock:Io is the dock charging station for your smartphone. Simply plug it into your computer's USB port, set your phone into the cradle, and it recharges your battery.
In addition to this simple function, we realize that people are increasingly spending an extraordinary amount of time married to their desks and computers. So why not have your workspace accented with accessories that are not only functional but also visually appealing? This is where the LunarDock:Io stands out.
 


LunarDock:Io is more than your standard dock


CNC machined from billet 6061 aircraft quality aluminum.


Durable anodized finish available in matte silver or black.


The LD:Io weighs over 1/2 of a pound.


Silicon rubber is used on both the base and cradle for protection.


Multi-phone support. The LD:Io supports iPhone4/5 and most center-bottom mounted MicroUSB based phones.


Oversized docking bay to accommodate most phone cases.


Docking connector is adjustable. Phone plug location can move 1.5mm fore and aft.


7 degree phone back support and matching phone connector angle.


And...it's lighted! RGB LEDs add a cool subtle glow in a variety of colors and patterns.


 
The LD:Io allows the owner to select from the following colors: Red, Red-Orange, Orange, Yellow-Orange, Yellow, Lime, Green, Aqua, Indigo, Blue, Violet, Pink or White.

Beyond just displaying a solid color, you can select two colors and have them alternate. You want to show your team pride? Select your colors and let everyone around you know even your LD:Io is a fan of your team. 
 
What effects can be selected?
The LunarDock:Io allows you to display a single selectable color. You can also make that color fade in and out similar to the sleep light on a Macbook. You can also select two colors and have them fade in and out as well. Or for those of you who really want to show off the LD:Io's capabilities, you can let it run in demo mode as seen in the video.
 
Will my phone work with the LD:Io?
We will be adding specific models of phones that should work with the LD:Io. There are so many case variables that it makes it almost impossible to say what will and won't fit without measuring each individual phone. Currently, the LD:Io supports the Apple Lightning connector for the iPhone5, the Apple 30 pin connector for the iPhone3/4 and center-bottom mounted MicroUSB. If your connector is directly in the center of the bottom of your phone and is less than 2.71"" wide by .59"" deep, you should have no problem using the LD:Io. If you want to be really safe, make sure your phone dimensions with your case are under 2.6"" wide and .5"" deep.   
Yes, that's right, the LD:Io supports your choice of Apple Lightning, Apple 30 Pin and MicroUSB connections!

The wide docking platform provides enough room to fit most cases.


The phone connector can be adjusted for those that want the absolute perfect fit to their case.
Stretch Goals
What would any crowdfunded project like this be without a mouthwatering stretch goal? We have some juicy LED effects lined up, and once we break the funding goal, we will be posting them. If you want to see how crazy we can get with LEDs, tell a friend and help us not only reach our funding goal but exceed it.
Let's see.... Maybe the first stretch goal will be a nice and bright single color flash.... ON-OFF-ON-OFF nice and fast to really make your coworkers angry.
 

How do I power the LunarDock:Io?
The LunarDock:Io is powered from a standard USB 5V source. We will include a matching gray MicroUSB to USB ""A"" cable for all the docks that are ordered with either the Apple 30 Pin or MicroUSB phone connector types.
We apologize but Apple iPhone 5 owners will need to provide their own Apple Lightning© cable to power the dock at this time.
 
Even with the skin off, the LD:Io is a stunning work of art.
 

Besides charging your phone, the LD:Io also works great as a night light to keep monsters at bay. And when you don't want the LED effects, you can always turn them off.
Why are we seeking funding?
While we have spent a significant amount of time testing and prototyping, manufacturing is expensive. With your support, LunarDock:Io will become a reality enabling us to bring this product to market. The LunarDock:Io is just the beginning of the projects we have lined up. This funding will help get a solid start and let us provide a unique product to our supporters.
The materials are already sourced and the suppliers are all in line and ready to go. The only real challenge we have is committing to the tooling setup and molding costs for both the silicon rubber pieces as well as the circuit boards. That is where the Indiegogo fanbase can help us out!
Every dollar helps us get closer to our goal, so even if you can't use the LD:Io for your current phone, a contribution to our project will help us fast track new ideas that will open our creativity to a new audience. Support for off-center MicroUSB phones, large format phones, and even a LunarDock for the iPad and iPad Mini? Yes, we have matching lighted designs all ready for these as well. Your support will not only help get this little gem in full production, but also set the stage for even more creative ideas.



Much more than simply charging your phone, the LD:Io has its own integrated circuit to give the owner control over the colors and lighting effects.

The first batch of prototypes straight from the anodizing tanks awaiting their electronic circuitry to be installed.

Risks and Challenges:
Any new endeavor is not without certain risks and challenges...
LunarDock:Io has significantly more ""moving pieces"" than the average phone dock. We have sorted out most of the logistics with sourcing of material, electronics, and shipping. However, as with any complicated project, coordinating logistics with multiple suppliers can result in delays. We feel communication plays a vital role and our pledge is to always be up-front with our supporters.
The delivery date is intentionally set to April 2013 with the hope that there are no parts sourcing issues that cause us to need that amount of time. We hope nothing will stand in our way to deliver the LD:Io to the supporters as soon as they come together. First ordered - first delivered. We promise to always keep supporters informed about ship dates and when they can expect delivery of their LD:Io. Simply, we vow to treat you the way we want to be treated as a customer.
How you can help:
While our goal to make this project a success is a modest $20,000, we appreciate every single contribution you provide to make this a reality. For those who can't spare the cash at this time, you can still help us out. While we would love everyone who visits this site to buy an LD:Io, we would benefit even more by having as many people as we can spread the word about our products on Facebook, Twitter, tech sites, blogs, word of mouth, whatever. The more people that see our creation, the better.

<h1>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">Once again (at a thousand time) when I noticed my phone is dead I started to think about the creation of the device that would always charge my phone itself and I would never EVER see my phone uncharged! </span><br/>
</h1>
<p>For a long time I considered different variants of charging: thermoelectric generators which could work at the moment when you take the phone in hand, radio waves as a source of energy, static electricity, piezo electric generators… BUT every variant apart has too little energy to charge a phone. And if this variants are united in one device, energy will probably be enough but the size of the gadget will be huge like a brick. Thinking and thinking about the decision of size problem I came to the variant of using solar elements, i.e. conversion of light (natural light during the day, lamplight during the night) into energy sufficient to charge the phone. </p>
<p>Lucky me, almost every mobile and smart phones nowadays are not very small sized, so the area for placing solar cells on the opposite side of the phone is enough for having the energy to charge it. All of us know about additional devices for charging the phone, but they usually are big and hard. Besides what's the point of taking additional devices when you can have light and thin case and forget about the necessity of charging? Also you could have seen cases like mine BUT they have 4 flaws: 1. Those cases are huge 2. not lightweight you feel it in your hand 3. as usual those cases are made only for one brand 4. And the most important thing: their capacity is not enough to forget about traditional charging through net. </p>
<p>First sample was made from polycrystalline solar cells, it worked, but for the full charge of the phone claimed a lot of time. That is why all subsequent models of ChaC were made from monocrystalline solar cells, their capacity is much higher, so the time of charging had been reduced.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F-ozrALImUOE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-ozrALImUOE&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F-ozrALImUOE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>But there is no sunlight at the evening and night, only lamplight. And whithout any additional element in this gadget my idea won't come to life. Then I had a thougth to use optical devices to improve the capacity of ChaC untill it would be enough to carge throug the lampligth. To be truthfull there were some problems with optics: I had to try everything that was on the market and it wasn't exactly what I needed. So I had to get in touch with the produser of optical devices and to communicate with almost all the levels of management trying to explain my demand. And by autumn of 2015 after all the calculations and tests they are ready to provide the nessesary optical device. But, as you understand, it costs money, because the new production needs the new matrix and new producing process. And if I'm the only one who order this good, the volume of an order should be not little. How to get a guaranteed pre-order from the consumer to make an order to the plant? And here comes the croudfunding plattform.</p>
<p>As a result, by all accounts, as mine as the Department of Engineering of the plant-producer of optics here goes ChaC that charges your phone by sunlight and lamplight. But what shall we do if there isn't any light? For example, it is night and the electricity is cutted. For that reason there is a thinniest battery in ChaC. Its thickness is not more than 2,2 mm and depending of the model of your cell its capacity is from 1000 upto 1400 mAh. It enough to extend the work of your device at least for a few hours. So, eventually I got ChaC. Case which helps you to forget about low battery forever!</p>
<p>After choosing solar elements, optics and battery we only had to work on power management system. The main criterion was to make it as compact as possible in size. To expedite this process, we have determined the useful volume, which can be used to ChaC himself remained thin, lightweight and not bulky, and therefore look attractive. Then we contacted the company producing boards. This company has developed a management system for our performance and dimensions. And again, to make an order we still need help of the croudfunding platform. </p>
<p>As a result, we have everything prepared for the assembly of ChaC. What we need is to get the required amount of pre-orders from you, backers, investors and people who want to help us in this project.</p>

Power management system. It ensures correct ChaC's functioning. Also
it allows to turn it on/off (you can see it by the LED indicator)
4.
Optical device. It elps to improve solar cells capacity. Optics
focuses light rays and this gives ChaC an opportunity to work not
only from daylight but also from lamplight.










Once again (at a thousand time) when I noticed my phone is dead I started to think about the creation of the device that would always charge my phone itself and I would never EVER see my phone uncharged! 

For a long time I considered different variants of charging: thermoelectric generators which could work at the moment when you take the phone in hand, radio waves as a source of energy, static electricity, piezo electric generators… BUT every variant apart has too little energy to charge a phone. And if this variants are united in one device, energy will probably be enough but the size of the gadget will be huge like a brick. Thinking and thinking about the decision of size problem I came to the variant of using solar elements, i.e. conversion of light (natural light during the day, lamplight during the night) into energy sufficient to charge the phone. 
Lucky me, almost every mobile and smart phones nowadays are not very small sized, so the area for placing solar cells on the opposite side of the phone is enough for having the energy to charge it. All of us know about additional devices for charging the phone, but they usually are big and hard. Besides what's the point of taking additional devices when you can have light and thin case and forget about the necessity of charging? Also you could have seen cases like mine BUT they have 4 flaws: 1. Those cases are huge 2. not lightweight you feel it in your hand 3. as usual those cases are made only for one brand 4. And the most important thing: their capacity is not enough to forget about traditional charging through net. 
First sample was made from polycrystalline solar cells, it worked, but for the full charge of the phone claimed a lot of time. That is why all subsequent models of ChaC were made from monocrystalline solar cells, their capacity is much higher, so the time of charging had been reduced.

But there is no sunlight at the evening and night, only lamplight. And whithout any additional element in this gadget my idea won't come to life. Then I had a thougth to use optical devices to improve the capacity of ChaC untill it would be enough to carge throug the lampligth. To be truthfull there were some problems with optics: I had to try everything that was on the market and it wasn't exactly what I needed. So I had to get in touch with the produser of optical devices and to communicate with almost all the levels of management trying to explain my demand. And by autumn of 2015 after all the calculations and tests they are ready to provide the nessesary optical device. But, as you understand, it costs money, because the new production needs the new matrix and new producing process. And if I'm the only one who order this good, the volume of an order should be not little. How to get a guaranteed pre-order from the consumer to make an order to the plant? And here comes the croudfunding plattform.
As a result, by all accounts, as mine as the Department of Engineering of the plant-producer of optics here goes ChaC that charges your phone by sunlight and lamplight. But what shall we do if there isn't any light? For example, it is night and the electricity is cutted. For that reason there is a thinniest battery in ChaC. Its thickness is not more than 2,2 mm and depending of the model of your cell its capacity is from 1000 upto 1400 mAh. It enough to extend the work of your device at least for a few hours. So, eventually I got ChaC. Case which helps you to forget about low battery forever!
After choosing solar elements, optics and battery we only had to work on power management system. The main criterion was to make it as compact as possible in size. To expedite this process, we have determined the useful volume, which can be used to ChaC himself remained thin, lightweight and not bulky, and therefore look attractive. Then we contacted the company producing boards. This company has developed a management system for our performance and dimensions. And again, to make an order we still need help of the croudfunding platform. 
As a result, we have everything prepared for the assembly of ChaC. What we need is to get the required amount of pre-orders from you, backers, investors and people who want to help us in this project.


 

ChaC available for any phone model which has proportions not less than 11 cm (4,3 in) in height and 6 cm (2,3 in) in width.

    


You can choose any color of case from any model of the phone you wish (Apple, Samsung, Sony, LG etc) 









Why
	we are not able to show you ChaC in a final assembly version?
Because
we have not got a management system and optics yet. They will be  produced
specially for us, but the required minimum order amount is 1000 pieces. Thats
why we need your help, your investments, pre-orders.

Does
	ChaC come with a warranty?

Absolutely!
 Every ChaC will come with a 1 year warranty for any
manufacturing faults or defects.
If
you want to get additional warranty on ChaC  (for mechanical damage
and ingress of water) you may buy perk (extended guarantee).


For
	which models will you produce ChaC?

 ChaC is available for any phone model which has proportions not less than 11
cm in height and  6 cm in width.

Who
	are we?
We
	are a small group of inventors, enthusiasts.  ChaC first came about
	as an idea to make something new, interesting and affordable for the
	most of phone owners.

How
	can I get in touch with your team?
If
you have any questions for ChaC team you can e-mail us to
chac.case@gmail.com or chac_case@mail.ru  





We'd
like to say thanks to all who have helped to us with working on ChaC.



And
of course, thanks to our Backers, you are the best!

P.S.:  If you like our idea, if you like ChaC, but you can`t make pre-order now, you can help to us - make some noise about our campaign. And we will be very grateful to you.",10.0,3,"1 Campaign

<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>Many months ago I was looking for a better way to connect my Android smart phone to my car.  I've been an Android user since the original Motorola Droid came out. In my three years as an Android user I've been puzzled at the relatively ineffective options to connect our Android devices into our vehicles.  In the past these were your options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headphone Jack: cables ran all over the car making it look bad and was unsafe</li>
<li>FM Radio Transmitters: poor audio quality and if you drove under power lines there is no way it would work</li>
<li>Bluetooth: many radios don't support it, and it always isn't easy to plug and play</li>
<li>iPhone Connector: *cough* unless you buy a new iPhone 5 *cough*</li>
<li>Brand Specific in Dash System: just isn't quite there yet <a href=""http://mashable.com/2012/04/18/iphone-in-car/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2012/04/18/iphone-in-car/</a>
</li>
</ul><p>With Android commanding well over 50% market share, and 75% of the smart phones shipped in the last quarter of the year being Android smart phones, this is definitely a problem that needs fixed.  Many other people have tried to fix this problems as well:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.androidcentral.com/nexus-7-makes-best-car-entertainment-system-ever"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.androidcentral.com/nexus-7-makes-best-car-entertainment-system-ever</a></p>

<p>With no two Android devices being alike it makes it hard to standardize things like dock connectors.</p>
<h2>Enter: The Smarter Dock</h2>
<p>To solve my connection problem I decided to create a new, simple docking method for our phones.  I decided that it would be best to use already well known and used standards: USB and HDMI.  The USB will keep the phone charged.  The HDMI will send the audio and video to the car's entertainment system.</p>
<h2>The Five Reasons you want the Smarter Dock:</h2>
<h3>1) It's Pretty Cool</h3>
<p>There are no other devices out on the market that allow you to watch movies, navigate, listen to music, and play games in your car all from your smart phone. Everyone that sees my prototype in my car ask where I got it, and how they could get one.  Now's your chance to wow everyone too.</p>
<h3>2) Music and Navigation</h3>
<p><img alt=""Navigation"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/233/762/29ae5f4a01a509571f933b60a4be4a79_large.png?1351542082"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You can use your phone to listen to your favorite music in high quality sound. You can also use your navigation apps to get you from point A to point B.</p>
<h3>3) Watching Movies</h3>
<p><img alt=""Watching Movies"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/233/771/c71a41299142dda7edeb04ef64ec0dad_large.png?1351542411"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>Adding video is where the Smarter Dock really starts to excel.  Whatever is on the cell phone screen you can send back to the back seat.  This may not seem very important at first; but any parent who has taken a road trip longer than an hour can testify that entertaining children is not an easy task.  Using apps like Google Play Movies and TV, Netflix, Slingbox, and many other video apps can make it possible to rent, buy, and watch movies on road trips.  This is something that is priceless on a six hour drive across the Wyoming tundra, if you know what I mean.  Even just showing the navigation screen will entertain children for a while.</span></p>
<h3><span>4) Playing Games</span></h3>
<p><span><img alt=""Playing Games"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/233/774/b289814f6d4583d230e0cc9af19d5fb1_large.png?1351542430"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><span><span>What really excites me is the ability for passengers in the car to be able to play the games that are on your phone.  Over 33% of cell phone owners play games on their phones.  It's becoming a natural part of life.  The Android system has made it possible to play more than just cell phone games.  For example, using ROMS one could play N64 games and PlayStation games.  With the recent success of Ouya, the gaming landscape has been completely changed.  Many high end phones today have similar specs to what is in the Ouya.  These same games that are made for the Ouya could also be made to play on your phone.  Imagine: your kids have a favorite game they play at home on your Ouya.  When you go on road trips they can just pick up playing from where they left off.</span></span></p>
<h3><span><span>5) Helping out someone like you, for all of us</span></span></h3>
<p><span><span>When I started this project I built it because I wanted something that could do all the above things. I know there are other people out there looking for a better solution. This is the next step in making our phones and cars more powerful, connected, and fun. I'm not from a big company trying to make money, I'm just a person trying to solve a problem.</span></span></p>

Tackling a project like this one is not an easy task. I've been working months already getting things lined up ready to post here on indiegogo. After the project is funded the real work begins. Here is the list of things I need to do:
Fill out application and pay dues to become an HDMI adopter Work with the manufacturer to get items manufactured and shipped to me Put together your rewards and get them to you in a quick matter Start working on the Utility Patent for the Smarter Dock Survive Thanksgiving at the In-Laws (just kidding... haha...)
Working with my manufacturer, here is the timeline after the project is funded: 45 Days lead time for the tooling About 10 weeks for it to get delivered to my door Another week or so for me to get everything sorted and shipped off to you.
Developing a new product is a fun, exciting, interesting, and challenging time. But with patience we can all become a part of something new and amazing. Thanks.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hey!</p>
<p>We are a small, dedicated and motivated technology start-up located in Melbourne, Australia. Over the few years our sophisticated design and technology team, comprised of people from around the world, has been working hard combining different cultures, experiences, solutions and ideas that has finally culminated in our revolutionary product which is now ready for launch -  PowerTrip.</p>
<p><img alt=""The App"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/826211/pictures/full/20130522214709-powertrip_the_app_png.png?1369284435"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 20px 10px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>PowerTrip is the worlds first real-time, automated emergency app. Utilising GPS tracking and live video/audio streaming, PowerTrip allows emergency services to locate you in situations when you would otherwise be unable to contact them.</p>
<p>PowerTrip is a revolutionary solution to a problem that cripples every emergency service around the world. When a person is in trouble, only rarely are they in a position to actually call the police.</p>
<p>Many of you will have seen the multitude of products, including mobile apps, which act as “personal alarms” or “emergency alerts”, however they don’t address the actual problem. These other services require users to flick a button, choose a message and press “send”, or call emergency services directly. From our research we found that this was the main issue for people – when they were attacked, there was no time to send the message, or push the button. Almost every time the phone was knocked out of the users hands.</p>
<p>So we decided that was the answer.</p>
<p>PowerTrip removes the need for making selections, typing messages, relaying information or launching messages. When you are in an emergency, and just like a grenade, PowerTrip detonates simply by the user letting go of the phone.</p>
<p>Letting go of the phone, and other actions, called “triggers”, automatically declare an emergency and notify the police.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Button Trigger</h3>
<p><em><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/826214/pictures/full/20130522214823-powertrip_appsolutely.png?1369284507"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 20px 10px;"" title=""Safe?""/></em></p>
<p><em>Imagine a woman walking home alone at night, or a man walking through a rough neighborhood. It could be someone being approached on a train, in a taxi, or in a side street. It could be waking up in the middle of the night and hearing someone moving around inside your house. You cant call the emergency number (911,999,000) as nothing has happened, but if someone suddenly attacks you, its too late to try and call.  </em></p>
<p><em>Now the user simply grabs their phone, and PowerTrip is armed instantly.</em></p>
<p><em>If the user removes their hand from the phone (For example, if they are grabbed, punched, pushed, stabbed), the app springs to action:</em></p>
<p><em>Alert is sent to police declaring an emergency, including:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>User Contact information, Current Location, Live Tracking of Location</em></li>
<li><em>Live video/audio stream of what is happening, stored in the cloud.</em></li>
</ul><p><em> </em></p>
<h3>The Headphone Trigger</h3>

<p><em>Many people use headphones whilst doing exercise, making them the perfect target for assault. Before going for a run, bike ride, or any outdoor activity where you would find yourself alone, users simply arm PowerTrip on their phone before they begin. PowerTrip will then run in the background of their phone, allowing them to continue to listen to music, use fitness apps, make and receive phone calls and check email.</em></p>
<p><em>In the event of an attack, users simply rip the headphones from the phone (which usually happens in an attack anyway), and PowerTrip declares an emergency and begins streaming live data to the police, allowing the Police to get to your location quickly.</em></p>
<p>These are examples of two of the triggers built into version 1 of PowerTrip, with several more in development for version 2.</p>
<p>PowerTrip is a real time emergency beacon that notifies the police as soon as you are in trouble.</p>
<p>In an emergency, such as a fire, or if an ambulance is needed, or if you are witnessing a crime, then calling the police (911,000 etc) works. It is when there is no time, such as if you are being bashed, assaulted, kidnapped, raped or worse, that the PowerTrip automated system can revolutionize how we protect ourselves.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/826212/pictures/full/20130522214742-powertrip_unleash_yourself.png?1369284466"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 10px;"" title=""Unleash""/></p>
<p>PowerTrip is a revolutionary weapon against attackers in 3 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>As soon as the attack begins, the police are automatically notified.</li>
<li>Showing an attacker that video of the event is streaming live to the police is a huge deterrent to committing a crime.</li>
<li>If a crime is committed, video evidence can be used in court against the attacker, even if the phone is destroyed, as the information streams live to our servers where it is stored.</li>
</ul><p>PowerTrip will be released in Melbourne, Australia in September 2013, and will rollout across the rest of Australia by November. It will then begin operating across Europe and the US in December, and is expected to be completed by March 2014.</p>
<p>PowerTrip will be released initially on Android and iOS, and toward September Blackberry and Windows Phone. PowerTrip will cost $4.99/month on a subscription service, or users can purchase 12 months for $49.99.</p>
<h3><strong>For the price of a cup of coffee every month, PowerTrip will arm you against attacks.</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/826217/pictures/full/20130522214923-powertrip_my_run_my_rules.png?1369284566"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 10px;"" title=""My Run, My Rules""/></p>
<p>The App for both operating systems has been designed and specified, as well as the receiving (Police/Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority backend) web interface. The server and database end are specified and tested, and agreements have been made with the relevant parties to introduce the system.</p>
<h3>So what do we need the money for?!</h3>
<p>We are aiming for a total of $30,000 in funding to bring PowerTrip to the Global market. We are spending $7,500 on completing the coding for the iOS app, and $12,500 on coding the Android App. A further $5,000 (and 2 amazing volunteers!) will be used on converting the Android App to run on Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS. We firmly believe that PowerTrip should be available to everyone, not just those with certain phones, hence the focus on getting each operating system to market as soon as possible, and in as many countries as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The remaining $5,000 will be used on marketing efforts up to the Australian launch, where (due to the nature of the app!) we have secured free advertising space from local councils, stores, major chains, radio stations and taxis - all the places where people would need the service! The $5,000 will be spent on online advertising - mainly social networks and banner ads to create awareness.</p>
<p>We realize that this is a huge undertaking, both for us, our coders, our liaisons working with the governments and police, and of course you, our backers!</p>
<p>We have come to realize that the most important outcome of this product is not just knowing you will be safe, but that all those round you, from girlfriends and wives to sisters and kids,  are protected when by themselves.</p>
<p>We also realize that without our backers, this system would never launch, and so we hope our perks below give you not only a great deal on the app, but a sense of the appreciation we have, and the wider community you are now helping to protect, of your backing.</p>
<h3>Is there any other way of helping PowerTrip launch?</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/826215/pictures/full/20130522214851-powertrip_shell_be_right.png?1369284533"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 10px;"" title=""She'll be right""/></p>
<p>Absolutely - We hope this is not too intrusive, but when PowerTrip launches in your area, we would love to send PowerTrip stickers to you in the mail to stick wherever you think they will be seen by people who will benefit from the App - Maybe on the train, or in the womans bathrooms, or on drinking fountains on a running track - Informing people of this new weapon is our biggest hurdle, and as a supporter, you can help!</p>
<h3>So what is the vision for PowerTrip?</h3>
<p>Well we would love for PowerTrip to be come a trusted weapon against personal attacks, and so as part our vision of community awareness we will be looking to provide PowerTrip for free to all school children and the elderly. We also realize that creating and maintaining a global security network will be fairly expensive, and so will be looking at selling in PowerTrip with national and multinational corporations for their work force, “Your 5,000 employees will all have access to the PowerTrip network, protecting them on their way to and from work, on the train for $X etc”.</p>
<p>Every country has problems with muggings, assults, rapes etc. The amount varies by country, by state, by city and by suburb, and existing methods do nothing to protect you in an emergency, and more importantly do nothing to make people feel safe. </p>
<p>To feel safe, people can carry anything from pepper spray and whistles to knives and guns. But they can be used against you. Especially if there is more then one attacker, or they take you by surprise. PowerTrip is designed from the ground up to activate when you are taken by surprise, and no matter how many attackers, records their voices and films their faces, while at the same time directing police to your location.</p>

<h3>Samsung Galaxy S battery cover with built-in LED Flash</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If you tried to take pictures in low light situations with a smartphone like the Galaxy S, you might have noticed how poor the outcome is. This is because this smartphone doesn't have a built-in LED flash.</p>
<p>For this reason we designed <strong>COVERLIGHT</strong>. Easy to assemble, simple to use and with a stylish design. Say goodbye to dark pictures!</p>
<p>The above video will show you how <strong>COVERLIGHT </strong>dramatically enhance the picture quality in different situations. With <strong>COVERLIGHT</strong> you will now able to take pictures and make videos whenever you want (for example during a night spent clubbing with your friends or capturing the moment when someone you love blows all the candles on his/her birthday cake).</p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.eledment.com/cover.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>WHAT IS</h3>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S has a 5MP camera which takes good pictures, has the autofocus function, but... it lacks a LED flash.<br/><strong>COVERLIGHT </strong>simply makes up for the lack of LED flash.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.eledment.com/coverlight_2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>HOW IT'S MADE</h3>
<p><strong>COVERLIGHT </strong>is entirely made in Italy, and consists of a high-quality polycarbonate battery cover and an electric circuit with a 1Watt hi power LED Flash. The high-quality fittings make <strong>COVERLIGHT </strong>the ideal solution for all those who own a Galaxy S and want to take pictures and make videos whenever they want and in every light conditions.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.eledment.com/circuit.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
<p>In order to start using <strong>COVERLIGHT </strong>you simply have to remove your Galaxy S battery cover, remove the battery and apply the electrically conductive adhesive. Now you have to put <strong>COVERLIGHT </strong>battery cover in place. When you press the button next to the speaker hole, the LED Flash will light up.<br/>The button position has been designed for both portrait and landscape mode.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.eledment.com/galaxy_1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>

The PadTop holds your iPad® and an Apple® Wireless Keyboard in a laptop-like case.
If you're like us, you:

Get frustrated when typing on the iPad's screen
Think the Apple wireless keyboard is the best option for the iPad
Want protection for both your keyboard and iPad while on the go
The PadTop solves all these problems with one easy-to-use case







The profile of the PadTop is sleek and thin. It will fit in your bag with ease.
The PadTop opens nearly 180 degrees, allowing you to type in almost any position.


 
 








The profile of the case will redirect sound from the back of the iPad towards you.
A simple notch in the top of the case makes for easy removal of the iPad.


 
 







You will feel right at home typing on a PadTop, just like a laptop.
Rubber bumpers help to eliminate movement on hard smooth surfaces.


 
What Colors Will be Offered & What's it Made Of?



The PadTop will be offered in black or white for the initial campaign.  If successful, other colors can be made available.
The PadTop is made of high-quality reinforced plastic for durability and stiffness.  We like high quality products too so don't worry, it'll be strong, it will have a great feel, and it will look great!
Why the Apple Wireless Keyboard?
Third party keyboards usually don't work well in the long run.  They are usually too small to use for long periods of time and don't have a comfortable typing ""feel"".  
Apple's wireless keyboard has a fantastic typing feel, is constructed well, and is FULL SIZED!  We've tried many of the third party keyboards and none of them stack up to the quality, style and reliability of Apple's wireless keyboard.  
Additional PadTop Benefits

The iPad and keyboard are well secured in the PadTop, which protects them from damage during use, transport or light drops.  
The keyboard is easily installed or removed for use on your Mac or other PC.
The PadTop gives you access to all of the ports on the top and bottom of the iPad for charging and inserting headphones.
Opening and closing the PadTop automatically turns the iPad on and off
We could not believe that there wasn't a case out there that held the iPad together with Apple's wireless keyboard.  Out of sheer need, we took matters into our own hands and designed our own!  
Current Status
We have gone through countless design iterations and printed our near final prototype (seen in our video). Through this latest prototype, we have learned a few things about our design that needed slight modification.   We have made these minor changes and are working with our tooling suppliers to complete the design of our injection molds. 
We are ready to start production as soon as we can obtain funding for the tooling and the initial orders of parts.  This is where you come in...
We Need Your Help
Injection mold tools are incredibly expensive, especially for larger, more complicated parts such as the PadTop.  Raw materials, piece parts, assembly labor and other costs add up to a significant up-front investment.  In order to make the PadTop a reality, your pledges are greatly needed.
Based on minimum order quantities for parts, we've come up with a necessary funding goal of $65k, including a little buffer to account for unforseen challenges.  The largest expense by far is attribted to fabrication of the mold tooling, followed by raw materials and part costs, licensing and other misc. fees.  If any funds are left over, we'll we re-invest the money in the project.

</h4>Se parte de Yoin! Lo más importante es que compartas nuestro proyecto ya sea a través de las herramientas de la página web o en las redes sociales, invita a tus amigos a conocer la app y comparte con nosotros tus ideas.<br/>Hagamos de la vuelta un viaje más seguro y barato!<br/><br/>Gracias,<br/>Equipo Yoin<br/><i><b><br/><br/></b></i><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>Has it happened to you that you are partying until late at night and you want to go home but there is no one that will join you in your way back home? How many times did you have to return alone to you home on bus or walking? </p><p>We all know that walking alone on the streets at night is dangerous. Most crimes are committed at those hours and lonely people are an easy target for criminals.</p><p>Many try to organize with other people when leaving a party, but they hardly get to assemble a group although there are people heading to the same direction.</p><p>With Yoin! you don't need to wait others to leave or to be ready, neither assemble a group by your own asking everyone their destination.  Yoin! is a app that arranges your way back home allowing you to join up with people who have to go in your same direction.</p><p><i><b>Who are we? </b></i></p><p>We are Design students from Universidad Católica de Chile. Our project started in our 4th year laboratory. From the first moment every one liked our idea and since we had advanced a lot in the project, we decided to keep developing both the operation and the look of our app. Since then we have conducted ethnographic studies, testings and validations, seeking feedback that allows us to roam and improve.</p><p><i><b>Why to group?</b></i></p><p>Young people in general have a maximum of CL$2.000 (US$3 on actual change) to move around at night. If they wanted to take a cab with that money they could only pay a 3km trip. Distance that is way below the average distance to their home. Grouping with Yoin!, you can assemble trips with people that goes to you same destination and split the fare reaching your home sharing a comfortable and safe trip.</p><p><i><b>How it works?</b></i></p><p>Open Yoin! Once you have arrived to the party or a little before leaving, and you will be able to see the list of active trips. You can explore them and see their details before you Yoin! them or you can create a new trip if you don't find one that suits you. </p><p>Trips are organized by milestones. These are predetermined sites in the city , which are of common interest or that congregate many people that live around. After Yoining you will be able to access the detailed information of the meeting and when little time is left for the exit you will get a warning notification. Later when you have already joined you can decide the best way to leave the place: either walking, taking the bus or sharing a cab fare. Don't forget to evaluate your travel partners according to punctuality and commitment with the trip at the moment of leaving or finishing the journey.</p><br/><p><i><b>Risks and Challenges</b></i><br/></p><p>We trust that Yoin! will be of great help to all young people and public in general, however, there are issues beyond our control that could lead to have a less explosive start than we plan.  In this case, the launching of the app could be delayed for a short time until we put together a large enough user base that guarantees a satisfactory user experience. We look forward to your support in spreading the project and to your attendance at events on that soon we will be reporting. We care about our user’s and partner’s opinion, which is why we are all paying attention to inquiries and recommendations by the means of contact that we have available for you. In addition, we promise to keep you informed throughout the process and on any changes that may occur.</p><br/><p>If we reach the goal we will be able to:</p><ul>
<li>Develop the application for both Android and iOS</li>
<li>Incorporate 45 landmarks in districts of Chile</li>
<li>Launch the application within 6 months of the goal accomplished</li>

Riesgos y DesafíosConfiamos en que Yoin! será de gran ayuda para todos los jóvenes y para la seguridad ciudadana, sin embargo, hay asuntos que escapan de nuestro control como podría ser un inicio menos explosivo del que proyectamos, razón que postergaría el lanzamiento de la aplicación por un breve tiempo hasta que consigamos una base de usuarios que garantice una experiencia satisfactoria para el usuario.Esperamos contar con su apoyo en la difusión del proyecto y con nuevas ideas que podríamos integrar a nuestro proyecto. Nos importa mucho la opinión de nuestros usuarios y colaboradores, es por esto que estaremos todo el tiempo atentos a consultas y recomendaciones por los medios de contacto disponibles.Además, nos comprometemos a mantenerlos informados durante todo el proceso y ante cualquier cambio que se pueda presentar.Comparte!
Se parte de Yoin! Lo más importante es que compartas nuestro proyecto ya sea a través de las herramientas de la página web o en las redes sociales, invita a tus amigos a conocer la app y comparte con nosotros tus ideas.Hagamos de la vuelta un viaje más seguro y barato!Gracias,Equipo YoinHas it happened to you that you are partying until late at night and you want to go home but there is no one that will join you in your way back home? How many times did you have to return alone to you home on bus or walking? We all know that walking alone on the streets at night is dangerous. Most crimes are committed at those hours and lonely people are an easy target for criminals.Many try to organize with other people when leaving a party, but they hardly get to assemble a group although there are people heading to the same direction.With Yoin! you don't need to wait others to leave or to be ready, neither assemble a group by your own asking everyone their destination.  Yoin! is a app that arranges your way back home allowing you to join up with people who have to go in your same direction.Who are we? We are Design students from Universidad Católica de Chile. Our project started in our 4th year laboratory. From the first moment every one liked our idea and since we had advanced a lot in the project, we decided to keep developing both the operation and the look of our app. Since then we have conducted ethnographic studies, testings and validations, seeking feedback that allows us to roam and improve.Why to group?Young people in general have a maximum of CL$2.000 (US$3 on actual change) to move around at night. If they wanted to take a cab with that money they could only pay a 3km trip. Distance that is way below the average distance to their home. Grouping with Yoin!, you can assemble trips with people that goes to you same destination and split the fare reaching your home sharing a comfortable and safe trip.How it works?Open Yoin! Once you have arrived to the party or a little before leaving, and you will be able to see the list of active trips. You can explore them and see their details before you Yoin! them or you can create a new trip if you don't find one that suits you. Trips are organized by milestones. These are predetermined sites in the city , which are of common interest or that congregate many people that live around. After Yoining you will be able to access the detailed information of the meeting and when little time is left for the exit you will get a warning notification. Later when you have already joined you can decide the best way to leave the place: either walking, taking the bus or sharing a cab fare. Don't forget to evaluate your travel partners according to punctuality and commitment with the trip at the moment of leaving or finishing the journey.Risks and ChallengesWe trust that Yoin! will be of great help to all young people and public in general, however, there are issues beyond our control that could lead to have a less explosive start than we plan.  In this case, the launching of the app could be delayed for a short time until we put together a large enough user base that guarantees a satisfactory user experience. We look forward to your support in spreading the project and to your attendance at events on that soon we will be reporting. We care about our user’s and partner’s opinion, which is why we are all paying attention to inquiries and recommendations by the means of contact that we have available for you. In addition, we promise to keep you informed throughout the process and on any changes that may occur.If we reach the goal we will be able to:
Develop the application for both Android and iOS
Incorporate 45 landmarks in districts of Chile
Launch the application within 6 months of the goal accomplished

<h2 align=""LEFT""> SleeKeys: A physical keyboard for iPhone and  Samsung Galaxy phones using NO electricity or Bluetooth – at 1/8” thickness. Makes typing on a touchscreen smartphone a truly amazing experience.</h2>
<p align=""LEFT"">Our team at S<strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">leekTec </span></strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">owns a collection of smartphones, including </span>iPhones and the Samsung Galaxy series. We tend to type a lot – often and long. And we hate doing it on these all-touch devices.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"">Smartphones are incredible machines, but typing by way of tapping on a glass window is just a little unnatural, and highly inaccurate. We have been searching high and low for a better replacement technology, but have always hit a brick (er... glass?) wall. So, like every red-blooded American team of innovators would do, we set out to create our own.  </p>
<h3 align=""LEFT"">What is it?</h3>
<p align=""LEFT"">Today, we present to you <strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">SleeKeys</span></strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">, a precision innovation that promises </span>to change your smartphone typing experience for the better. <strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">SleeKeys </span></strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">is </span>a sleek, simple and clever iPhone case that sports an integrated full-size QWERTY keyboard, providing a faster, better typing experience less prone to mistakes. A wicked-cool flip mechanism allows you to deploy and hide the keyboard with a one-handed flip motion – flip it open, flip it closed. To reiterate, you flip it out when you need a keyboard, and it disappears when you’re done typing. Intrigued? Read on!</p>
<h3 align=""LEFT"">How’s it special?</h3>
<p align=""LEFT"">It is NOT a Bluetooth keyboard. It uses NO electricity. It NEVER needs charging of any sort. So yes, we believe it’s pretty special. We have developed a patent-pending technology that helps <strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">SleeKeys </span></strong>interact with your phone seamlessly. When flipping the keyboard onto the front on your smartphone it aligns perfectly with the phone’s on-screen keyboard, and you are ready to begin typing immediately with no wait or connectivity hiccups. The <strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">SleeKeys </span></strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">typing experience is one akin to that </span>of the best tactile BlackBerry keyboards. Input is precise, button feedback is noticeable and satisfying, and the overall fit and finish of the keys is perfectly engineered and machined. We are modern-day consumers ourselves. So we understand that a good smartphone accessory can be no less impressive than the phone itself. In every stage of development of our <strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">SleeKeys </span></strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">project, we have assessed </span>and reassessed every conceivable fault and flaw. We have obsessed over a design simultaneously stylish and functional to build a finished product that we would love to go out and buy ourselves. The result of all this research and development and our patent-pending typing technology is also a thinness wow factor. The <strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">SleeKeys </span></strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">keyboard is just 1/8” thick – the </span>heights of two pennies – and it weighs next to nothing!</p>
<h3 align=""LEFT"">What did it take?</h3>
<p align=""LEFT"">Getting here wasn’t easy. We never even expected it to be so hard… But our dedication to excellence from dream to design to development to delivery continuously pushed us forward. We started out working on our little idea more than a year ago. Working with top design firms in North America, our team considered multiple directions and design options. We made more than a few prototypes to test and prove our technology, and only then began the case design process. A lot of money went into the final design, getting it done right here in the US. Truth be told, we could’ve designed it in China for 5 percent of what we spent here… but we don’t believe in skimping on anything or in applying shortcuts. Every small detail of this product has been hammered out to perfection, making this a smartphone case that can compete with the best of them. To share a little secret, we’ve spentmore than $15,000 just on prototypes to make sure that the keys have the right feel and function.</p>
<h3 align=""LEFT"">Are we there yet?</h3>
<p align=""LEFT"">Nearly. It’s very well known that many startup innovation projects get delayed and run into glitches and complications of every variety. We made a big decision in not addressing the Indiegogo audience with a raw or struggling prospect. We have waited until now, until the concept has been finalized to our utterly demanding standards. The manufacturing process has already begun, with the next step being the bringing of a ready product to the masses.</p>
<h3 align=""LEFT"">How can you help?</h3>
<p align=""LEFT"">You can help in more ways than one! You can refer your friends to our Indiegogo page and thus help us become more popular. You can write to us with suggestions for upcoming products or product features. But, most importantly, you can help us along in the manufacturing process with funds that will ensure we bring our product to fruition as quickly as possible. As we stand now, every dollar matters. For your partnership, you are of course privy to the first batch of our ready products, before anyone else! Manufacturing is very expensive, involving the overcoming of logistic, linguistic and operational barriers. It is in this stage of our journey that you play the largest part. To produce the very best product possible, we hired a leading sourcing company in Boston. They put us in touch with a Hong Kong manufacturing firm known for its experience and exquisite manufacturing techniques, particularly with molded smartphone accessories. Here too we shied away from cheaper, less proven companies, even as that could’ve lowered our costs by 50%.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"">Production of <strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">SleeKeys </span></strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">for iPhone 5 and for the Samsung Galaxy S3 is </span>already underway. We hope to receive the first sample parts mid-May. Allowing a full month for quality inspection and second rounds of functionally testing, we estimate a full-scale release date in mid-July. You may note that this is a rather prolonged timeline, but we are allotting ourselves a margin of error, not to disappoint the Indiegogo public with delayed delivery on promises.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"">As soon as we get our hands on the Galaxy S4, we will begin a brand new SleeKeys <span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">design for it. We estimate our S4 model to arrive end of August. </span>Initial color offers are black and white; complementing the highly popular colors of the smartphones they are indented to cleave to. We hope that, with your strong support, we will be able to develop <strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">SleeKeys </span></strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">in more </span>colors and for additional phone models.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"">We have designed a belt clips/holster companion to <strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">SleeKeys </span></strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">for both </span>iPhone 5 and the S3. You can choose to pre-order <strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">SleeKeys </span></strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">on its own or </span>as a combo offer with our custom holster.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"">SleeKeys <span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">for iPhone and S3 will retail for $50 (estimate), and the holster will </span>retail for $20 (estimate). Indiegog funders get <strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">SleeKeys </span></strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">for just $40, and\ </span>the combo offer for a bargain at $50.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"">We hope that you find <strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">Sleekeys </span></strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">as innovative and as exciting as we do. </span>You are cordially invited to support our project, and we thank you so much for your interest in <strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">SleeKeys</span></strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">.</span></p>
<p align=""LEFT"">And always remember: If typing on your smartphone drives you mad, don’t flip out – just flip out <strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic-Bold;"">SleeKeys</span></strong><span style=""font-family: CenturyGothic;"">!</span></p></div>","SleeKeys: A physical keyboard for iPhone and  Samsung Galaxy phones using NO electricity or Bluetooth – at 1/8” thickness.

A wicked-cool flip mechanism allows you to deploy and hide the keyboard with a one-handed flip motion – flip it open, flip it closed. To reiterate, you flip it out when you need a keyboard, and it disappears when you’re done typing. Intrigued? Read on!
How’s it special?
It is NOT a Bluetooth keyboard. It uses NO electricity. It NEVER needs charging of any sort. So yes, we believe it’s pretty special. We have developed a patent-pending technology that helps SleeKeys interact with your phone seamlessly. When flipping the keyboard onto the front on your smartphone it aligns perfectly with the phone’s on-screen keyboard, and you are ready to begin typing immediately with no wait or connectivity hiccups. The SleeKeys typing experience is one akin to that of the best tactile BlackBerry keyboards. Input is precise, button feedback is noticeable and satisfying, and the overall fit and finish of the keys is perfectly engineered and machined. We are modern-day consumers ourselves. So we understand that a good smartphone accessory can be no less impressive than the phone itself. In every stage of development of our SleeKeys project, we have assessed and reassessed every conceivable fault and flaw. We have obsessed over a design simultaneously stylish and functional to build a finished product that we would love to go out and buy ourselves. The result of all this research and development and our patent-pending typing technology is also a thinness wow factor. The SleeKeys keyboard is just 1/8” thick – the heights of two pennies – and it weighs next to nothing!
What did it take?
Getting here wasn’t easy. We never even expected it to be so hard… But our dedication to excellence from dream to design to development to delivery continuously pushed us forward. We started out working on our little idea more than a year ago. Working with top design firms in North America, our team considered multiple directions and design options. We made more than a few prototypes to test and prove our technology, and only then began the case design process. A lot of money went into the final design, getting it done right here in the US. Truth be told, we could’ve designed it in China for 5 percent of what we spent here… but we don’t believe in skimping on anything or in applying shortcuts. Every small detail of this product has been hammered out to perfection, making this a smartphone case that can compete with the best of them. To share a little secret, we’ve spentmore than $15,000 just on prototypes to make sure that the keys have the right feel and function.
Are we there yet?
Nearly. It’s very well known that many startup innovation projects get delayed and run into glitches and complications of every variety. We made a big decision in not addressing the Indiegogo audience with a raw or struggling prospect. We have waited until now, until the concept has been finalized to our utterly demanding standards. The manufacturing process has already begun, with the next step being the bringing of a ready product to the masses.
How can you help?
You can help in more ways than one! You can refer your friends to our Indiegogo page and thus help us become more popular. You can write to us with suggestions for upcoming products or product features. But, most importantly, you can help us along in the manufacturing process with funds that will ensure we bring our product to fruition as quickly as possible. As we stand now, every dollar matters. For your partnership, you are of course privy to the first batch of our ready products, before anyone else! Manufacturing is very expensive, involving the overcoming of logistic, linguistic and operational barriers. It is in this stage of our journey that you play the largest part. To produce the very best product possible, we hired a leading sourcing company in Boston. They put us in touch with a Hong Kong manufacturing firm known for its experience and exquisite manufacturing techniques, particularly with molded smartphone accessories. Here too we shied away from cheaper, less proven companies, even as that could’ve lowered our costs by 50%.
Production of SleeKeys for iPhone 5 and for the Samsung Galaxy S3 is already underway. We hope to receive the first sample parts mid-May. Allowing a full month for quality inspection and second rounds of functionally testing, we estimate a full-scale release date in mid-July. You may note that this is a rather prolonged timeline, but we are allotting ourselves a margin of error, not to disappoint the Indiegogo public with delayed delivery on promises.
As soon as we get our hands on the Galaxy S4, we will begin a brand new SleeKeys design for it. We estimate our S4 model to arrive end of August. Initial color offers are black and white; complementing the highly popular colors of the smartphones they are indented to cleave to. We hope that, with your strong support, we will be able to develop SleeKeys in more colors and for additional phone models.
We have designed a belt clips/holster companion to SleeKeys for both iPhone 5 and the S3. You can choose to pre-order SleeKeys on its own or as a combo offer with our custom holster.
SleeKeys for iPhone and S3 will retail for $50 (estimate), and the holster will retail for $20 (estimate). Indiegog funders get SleeKeys for just $40, and\ the combo offer for a bargain at $50.
We hope that you find Sleekeys as innovative and as exciting as we do. You are cordially invited to support our project, and we thank you so much for your interest in SleeKeys.
And always remember: If typing on your smartphone drives you mad, don’t flip out – just flip out SleeKeys!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>The device variation</b></p>
<p>You know,
many people, including me, watch satellite TV. So, we have to use 2 consoles:
one of them is for a TV set and another one is for a set-top box. And it`s
extremely inconvenient! External sound system will only add problems with
control. Our innovative device can easily solve this problem.  But why don`t we use the gadget for an air
conditioner control too, for instance? Just compose the most useful buttons of
all the consoles on the hold screen. It allows you to control household
appliances with the greatest comfort. Moreover, you can create desktop widgets
for a maximum speed control.</p>
<p>It
is often necessary to make a sequence of actions. For example, to turn on TV,
receiver or audio- system and to set air conditioner to the desired
temperature. So do it with only one click. All you need is to press a special
multi-button!</p>

<p>I usually wear a Bluetooth headset while I am driving. It is very useful!</p>
<p>If
someone calls me when I am driving, I can talk with him and focus on the road
with Bluetooth headset easily. However, I cannot write down the messages at the
same time because it will be dangerous to remove my hand from the steering
wheel.</p>
<p>In
the market, I have not found any Bluetooth headset device with voice recording
function. But now, we can simply press a button to record our messages easily
by using <b>Taker</b>.</p>
<p><b>Taker </b>is
a newly developed functional Bluetooth headset which does not only allow users
to make and receive calls, but also to record voice and allow mobile control of
the camera function.</p>

</div><br/></div>","I usually wear a Bluetooth headset while I am driving. It is very useful!
If
someone calls me when I am driving, I can talk with him and focus on the road
with Bluetooth headset easily. However, I cannot write down the messages at the
same time because it will be dangerous to remove my hand from the steering
wheel.
In
the market, I have not found any Bluetooth headset device with voice recording
function. But now, we can simply press a button to record our messages easily
by using Taker.
Taker is
a newly developed functional Bluetooth headset which does not only allow users
to make and receive calls, but also to record voice and allow mobile control of
the camera function.
This
is so great!


A Bluetooth headset helps for voice recording while you are driving

While
driving on the road, you will use a Bluetooth headset to make and receive
calls. Sometimes, you want to record some messages but you cannot write them
down immediately. At the moment, Taker can help you to record messages. When
you are talking with someone, press the side button of Taker headset, your
conversations will be recorded in your smartphone APP- Taker Voice. If you want
to play back your last voice record, you can double press the button of Taker
headset.





Voice
is voice recording App. Users can use this voice recording App to record
messages anytime. You can also share your voice format file to email. 
Trial Edition available on Google Play
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apptask.android.ptt

Playback your last voice record



You can double press the side button of Taker Bluetooth headset, it can control your smartphone remotely and plays back your last voice message on your smartphone.




How to use Taker Headset








Taker headset is not only for voice
recording. We are also developing more useful APP to pair with Taker headset
like Snapshot Taker which is a camera APP for smartphones. Users can use Taker
headset as a remote shutter to take self-snapshots.
Firmware supportYou can pair Taker
headset with all mobile phones which have internal Bluetooth technology. This is the same function as
traditional Bluetooth headset. If you are using smartphone and pairing
with this, you can remotely control the APP in your
smartphone.
Taker Voice APP is a
voice recording app. It works on Android system but not on iOS system because Apple
does not open the source code for recording.
Taker Snapshot APP is a
self-shot camera and works both on Android and iOS system.


















We
have come a long way to create and develop, but we still need
help. You can see that we has already developed a working prototype from a
concept. You will be interested in it! 















Risks & Challenges

Taker
Bluetooth headset is different from the traditional Bluetooth headset. Taker
headset can remotely control your smartphone APP to be more functional. If you
go through the Bluetooth market, you cannot find a headset with more functions

<p>Everyone in Xpleo is currently working as volounteers because we believe in this project. We work full time, part time or free time – as much as we possibly can. We aim to get funded, so we can dedicate all our time to develop Xpleo.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT DO YOU GET AND WHAT DO WE NEED?</strong></p>
<p>By supporting us, you will become a part of Xpleo and you will be able to give your vote and decide what functions we should develop first. We cannot offer you merchandise or other goodies. However, we can offer you a chance to become part of the development of a democratic and transparent platform, for sharing knowledge in a new and advanced way.</p>
<p>If we reach our goal of 5,500 dollars the money will be spent on expanding the functionality of the platform. At the moment the user can only vote on individual politicians and parties. We want to hire more programmers to help develop the ability to evaluate the politicians in connection with the specific social issues they vote on. We also want to expand the users ability to see the statistics over time and from where in the world votes are coming. For this purpose, we will develop a Timeline that shows the distribution of votes over time in conjunction with important events. We will also provide a Geographical map so the user can see where in the world the votes are coming from. And this is where you come in.</p>
<p>We want to start the democratic process right now. By contributing you can either vote for us to first develop the Timeline or Geographical function. Help decide what we should focus on.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WAS THE IDEA OF XPLEO BORN?</strong></p>
<p>We have been working on the project for almost a year but the idea is more than a decade old. It was born out of a frustration with the way we evaluate the world around us, the leaders we elect and even the products we purchase. We witnessed the evolution of technology and saw how people started using the internet to share their lives, thoughts and opinions, but the websites they used did not seem efficient for this purpose. Today, evaluation is done by either giving “likes”, stars, or with long descriptive text. But “likes” and stars don't provide any information about what particular aspect was voted on, and reading long paragraphs of text takes a long time and can't be quantified. What was missing was a system that allowed the user to vote on specified aspects and on a scale. Such information could provide reliable statistical data which could be easily read by anyone.</p>
<p>We believe that the free flow of information and social networks has an important role to play in the development of democracy and social participation. Social appropriation of the Internet is becoming a significant part of the democratic process. Social media is being widely used by both activists and citizens to relay information which is not always accessible through traditional media, and also to bypass censorship. It`s apparent that the emergence of new technology and communication options has formed a new arena for public debate. The phenomenon also presents a new and innovative way to ensure the vitality of democracy. Xpleo is a product of this new reality.</p>
<p>The platform is currently in beta stage and we have decided to focus on politicians, political parties and social issues to begin with. This, however, is only the beginning. In the future we plan to expand. One of our long term goals is to get photo recognition into your smartphone, so you can take a picture of anything and instantly see what others have voted and easily vote yourself.</p>
<p>If you can't back us up financially, you can still help us! Sign up as a beta-user at xpleo.dk and share your opinions on politicians and social topics. Xpleo is 100 % dependent on your opinions to make the database as complete as possible. Together, we will develop the democratic platform step by step.</p>

<p>Before I was able to launch the Slip wallet, my entire manufacturing facility, as well as my home, prototypes, machines, tools, and everything else I owned, was burned in the July 2018 Northern California Carr Wildfire. The disaster was devastating, but it wasn’t enough to destroy my vision. In the the aftermath of the fire, work on the wallet continued. Failure just wasn't an option.</p>
<p>15 months of hard work, revisions, and dedication later, the Slip is ready to be introduced to the world. This project is a big step toward helping my company rise from the ashes—literally. When you choose to back my business, you will receive the finished Slip wallet, and be a key player in helping to rebuild STOW. </p>

Everything you need, nothing you don’t.

Black Texture, Blue Texture, Red Texture, Gray Texture,
Olive Green, Strikers White,  Sea Water Teal, Sea Foam, Light Tan/White
 
The Slip is an aluminum minimalist wallet engineered from the ground up with an aerospace engineer’s stamp of approval.
CNC machined from a single piece of 6061 aerospace aluminum 
Engineered and manufactured 100% in the United States
Credit cards are securely stowed and easily accessed
Plenty of space for cash, business cards, and loyalty cards 
Secure universal phone attachment system
Lightweight—only weighs one ounce    
            After years of searching for a suitable wallet to no avail, I began developing a wallet for myself in October 2017. Then ensued a 10-month effort of designing, engineering, prototyping, and refining my ideal minimalist wallet. The result was the Slip, a wallet worth creating. 
Before I was able to launch the Slip wallet, my entire manufacturing facility, as well as my home, prototypes, machines, tools, and everything else I owned, was burned in the July 2018 Northern California Carr Wildfire. The disaster was devastating, but it wasn’t enough to destroy my vision. In the the aftermath of the fire, work on the wallet continued. Failure just wasn't an option.
15 months of hard work, revisions, and dedication later, the Slip is ready to be introduced to the world. This project is a big step toward helping my company rise from the ashes—literally. When you choose to back my business, you will receive the finished Slip wallet, and be a key player in helping to rebuild STOW. 
I am extremely excited to present this innovative new wallet, and hopefully many future STOW products, to the world. Thanks for your support!

<h3>What is FileProducer?</h3>
<div>FileProducer is a web community which allows users to request, sell, and donate customized files created by/for other users, all within an efficient, streamlined interface.  Functionality is not limited to any specific industries or file types, although the service will be geared toward the digital multimedia community at launch.  Files can be created via written instructions or by modifying/combining the contents of user-provided file(s).
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Standard features in many of today’s outsourcing websites include the following: user feedback, price bidding, traditional portfolios, and the sharing of personal contact information.  These features would be great if it were still the ‘90s; however, such features have been removed from this model due to the streamlined, logical alternatives arrived at.  The end result is an outsourcing website that is fun and efficient, for both hobbyists and professionals alike.</p>
<p><strong>Transparent Communication</strong></p>
<p>All communication between users is posted publicly.  This transparency eliminates the need for user feedback and ratings.</p>
<p><strong>Benchmarks</strong></p>
<p>This system allows users to build their “portfolio” by participating in benchmark tests.  Benchmarks are quick assignments created by the user community aimed at providing other users the opportunity to submit and display their abilities in a particular field.</p>
<p>These competency assessments, in conjunction with transparent communication, allow users to prove their comprehension and creativity in real world situations.  Benchmarks allow relevant technical and creative abilities to be compared against others in a relatively objective way.</p>
<p><strong>Free Files and Paid Files</strong></p>
<p>After participating in at least one benchmark, you will be able to create free or paid files for other users.  Creating free and paid files will help you establish a communication history and give you a chance to prove your reliability.  With paid files, a 5% service fee is added.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed Prices</strong></p>
<p>To save time and simplify the production process, paid file requests are posted at a “take it or leave it” price point.  At launch, rewards can be set between $1 and $50.  These limits may change over time.</p>
<p><strong>Community Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>If a dispute arises because of a user’s inability to communicate or because of a lack of quality work, a task will be flagged and posted so that the community can look at the files and communication history to vote on which party committed the error.  There will be various incentives to encourage users to participate in this community service.</p>
<p><strong>File Rights</strong></p>
<p>Freely created files are given to the public domain.  Files created with a monetary exchange become the intellectual property of the party who requested the file.</p>

<h3>What's Required?</h3>
<p>After having several independent, pro bono programmers fail me (over the course of multiple years), I've come to the conclusion that I have to work with (and pay) a real development house if I want to bring FileProducer to life.  From the discussions I've had with various developers, development costs have been estimated to be between $20,000 - $80,000 for between 300 and 600 hours of work.</p>
<p>For $50,000, I could have the core site developed, along with paying for cloud storage, travel expenses, legal fees, and the $5,000 in prizes I'm offering to my fundraising campaign team.  Any money raised beyond the goal will go back into the project to have some of its planned secondary features developed.</p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Josh Hanchar, 26, and I consider myself to be just another vessel in the ever-growing field of multidisciplinary multimedia creative types.</p>
<p>At age 13, without any formal education or workplace experience, I was contracted to complete and oversee the development of six separate $5,000+ software projects for a nationally recognized non-profit over the course of roughly three years.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
FileProducer's model was created with peak efficiency and maximum versatility in mind.  Economically, technologically, and socially the world is changing, and it's time we begin to implement systems which reflect those changes.</div>

<div>Ask yourself the following questions:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Are resumes, credentials, and arbitrary portfolios the most efficient ways to find the person best suited for a particular task, or is an objective, transparent, accessible record more efficient?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Should hobbyists, amateurs, or small businesses with ambitious projects be out of luck because they can't financially afford to work with advertised professionals, or should they have access to a database of skilled people who can provide them with assistance at a low financial cost, or better yet, who may be willing to help out for free?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Does it make more sense to put a large project in the hands of one person, or does it make more sense to make micro-tasks so that individuals only have to take responsibility for smaller fragments or components of a project?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>What is the potential for FileProducer's use in the realm of scientific and medical research?  In the field of engineering?  Could large-scale collaborations be made possible with such a service?</li>

<div>These are some of the questions that I asked myself while designing the FileProducer model.  The possibilities are wonderful, and I'd love to see what the world could do with this type of functionality at its disposal.</div>

What is FileProducer?
FileProducer is a web community which allows users to request, sell, and donate customized files created by/for other users, all within an efficient, streamlined interface.  Functionality is not limited to any specific industries or file types, although the service will be geared toward the digital multimedia community at launch.  Files can be created via written instructions or by modifying/combining the contents of user-provided file(s).
Features
Standard features in many of today’s outsourcing websites include the following: user feedback, price bidding, traditional portfolios, and the sharing of personal contact information.  These features would be great if it were still the ‘90s; however, such features have been removed from this model due to the streamlined, logical alternatives arrived at.  The end result is an outsourcing website that is fun and efficient, for both hobbyists and professionals alike.
Transparent Communication
All communication between users is posted publicly.  This transparency eliminates the need for user feedback and ratings.
Benchmarks
This system allows users to build their “portfolio” by participating in benchmark tests.  Benchmarks are quick assignments created by the user community aimed at providing other users the opportunity to submit and display their abilities in a particular field.
These competency assessments, in conjunction with transparent communication, allow users to prove their comprehension and creativity in real world situations.  Benchmarks allow relevant technical and creative abilities to be compared against others in a relatively objective way.
Free Files and Paid Files
After participating in at least one benchmark, you will be able to create free or paid files for other users.  Creating free and paid files will help you establish a communication history and give you a chance to prove your reliability.  With paid files, a 5% service fee is added.
Fixed Prices
To save time and simplify the production process, paid file requests are posted at a “take it or leave it” price point.  At launch, rewards can be set between $1 and $50.  These limits may change over time.
Community Arbitration
If a dispute arises because of a user’s inability to communicate or because of a lack of quality work, a task will be flagged and posted so that the community can look at the files and communication history to vote on which party committed the error.  There will be various incentives to encourage users to participate in this community service.
File Rights
Freely created files are given to the public domain.  Files created with a monetary exchange become the intellectual property of the party who requested the file.
Audiences
FileProducer for Musicians
FileProducer for Audio Producers
FileProducer for Video Producers
FileProducer for Illustrators/Designers
FileProducer for Writers
FileProducer for Game Developers


What's Required?
After having several independent, pro bono programmers fail me (over the course of multiple years), I've come to the conclusion that I have to work with (and pay) a real development house if I want to bring FileProducer to life.  From the discussions I've had with various developers, development costs have been estimated to be between $20,000 - $80,000 for between 300 and 600 hours of work.
For $50,000, I could have the core site developed, along with paying for cloud storage, travel expenses, legal fees, and the $5,000 in prizes I'm offering to my fundraising campaign team.  Any money raised beyond the goal will go back into the project to have some of its planned secondary features developed.
About Me
My name is Josh Hanchar, 26, and I consider myself to be just another vessel in the ever-growing field of multidisciplinary multimedia creative types.
At age 13, without any formal education or workplace experience, I was contracted to complete and oversee the development of six separate $5,000+ software projects for a nationally recognized non-profit over the course of roughly three years.
Software development seemed like a promising field, but when I graduated high school, I found myself in a dilemma: Like many others that I now know, I had “too many” interests.  I realized that I would not be content being tied down to a single field, so my only option was to come up with some other option if I wanted to fulfill my potential.  The only problem was that I had no idea how to do that.
With no apparent solution at the time, I found myself with a variety of jobs including doing deliveries for a local cafe, working at a computer repair shop, and seizing random freelancing opportunities whenever they showed up.  Today, many years later, I teach private music lessons at a local music school.
Fortunately, I never gave up on my search for an alternative path.  About four years ago I finally caught a glimpse of what my alternative path could be.  After over a thousand hours of hours of unpaid work, and after countless discussions with friends, family, and professional consultants, that glimpse ended up evolving into the service currently codenamed FileProducer.


The Impact
FileProducer's model was created with peak efficiency and maximum versatility in mind.  Economically, technologically, and socially the world is changing, and it's time we begin to implement systems which reflect those changes.
 
Ask yourself the following questions:
 


Are resumes, credentials, and arbitrary portfolios the most efficient ways to find the person best suited for a particular task, or is an objective, transparent, accessible record more efficient?




Should hobbyists, amateurs, or small businesses with ambitious projects be out of luck because they can't financially afford to work with advertised professionals, or should they have access to a database of skilled people who can provide them with assistance at a low financial cost, or better yet, who may be willing to help out for free?




Does it make more sense to put a large project in the hands of one person, or does it make more sense to make micro-tasks so that individuals only have to take responsibility for smaller fragments or components of a project?




What is the potential for FileProducer's use in the realm of scientific and medical research?  In the field of engineering?  Could large-scale collaborations be made possible with such a service?


 
These are some of the questions that I asked myself while designing the FileProducer model.  The possibilities are wonderful, and I'd love to see what the world could do with this type of functionality at its disposal.

  Although Lux Pencil stylus is a great product, it is not a perfect one. The stylus still has some drawbacks such as:1. Heavier than normal styluses. This is an unwanted result of the integration of many pioneer features to the stylus. The cover is made of high-quality metal to ensure its sleekness, but this choice also slightly increases the weight of the stylus.2. Sweat can stick on the stylus after long working hours and make you feel uncomfortable. You can easily wipe out this problem by drying your hands. But after all, this is still a drawback, and as a potential backer, you deserve to know everything about the stylus, especially its weaknesses.     Lux Pencil stylus is obviously not suitable for everyone. So please think twice before place an order, especially if 1. You are a perfectionist who requires a 100% perfect stylus. We have been doing our best to design the Lux Pencil stylus at the most premium level. But this product stills carries on some drawbacks as revealed above. Do not back this campaign if you can not accept those downsides.2. You are in an urgent situation and need a stylus immediately. As you may guess, we can not send you a Lux Pencil stylus in 2 or 3 days from your purchase date. Everything takes time. The production takes time. The distribution takes time. Do not back this campaign if you can not afford our Timeline.      Lux Pencil stylus is a perfect fit for you if you are looking for a beautiful stylus with impressive features, including: 1. Luxurious appearance2. Presentation remote integrated3. Control camera remotely4. Strong waterproof ability5. Pressure & tilt sensitivity6. Long battery life & convenient wireless charging7. Compatible with both Apple and Android devices        We wish we could keep the good price levels for a long time. Unfortunately, the later your order is placed and sent to the factory, the higher costs they will charge us. As a result, we must apply the higher prices.    Live ChatSend Us A MessageDownload Press Kit",51.0,2,"3 Campaigns

<h2>ABOUT THIS PROJECT </h2>
<p>Hi from Australia and thanks for stopping by to check out our project. I'm Kevin Whitley, founder of <a href=""http://www.kwadesign.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KWA Design Group</a>, an industrial design group in Sydney, Australia. </p>
<p>KWA Design have been operating for more than 30 years and designed thousands of  innovative iconic products for multinationals such as Motorola, Samsung, Nokia, Nike, SMEs and entrepreneurs.  Now we'd like to release some of our own cool and inspirational products to the world.  The first is our <strong>NU Lifestyle RFID Blocking Card Holder </strong>...<strong> </strong>the sleekest and most comfortable RFID blocking Card Holder in the world.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>After sitting on a Fat Wallet for years, I wanted to come up with a design that would eliminate bulk while incorporating an efficient and sophisticated design.</p>
<p>If you’re a guy with a bulky wallet, you’ll understand where I’m coming from. Most men with a bad back have reported to be suffering from <a href=""http:/www.conairformen.com/get-the-edge.php?tcID=60&amp;tip=80"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Piriformis Syndrome </a>which is a misalignment of the spine and is often called Fat Wallet Syndrome.  </p>

<p><em>Sitting on a Fat Wallet for an extended period can cause backache </em></p>
<h2>Do we really need a wallet today?</h2>
<p>With a smartphone in everyone’s reach, business cards, photos, contact details  for family and friends are easily accessible, eliminating the need to store them in a conventional wallet. </p>
<p>Our research shows that today, most people use just 2-3 cards everyday, and with our <strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holder</strong> at hand, we can safely answer the above question, <strong><em>No</em></strong>, we no longer need a conventional wallet today. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/570998/pictures/full/20121206183426-photo2.jpg?1354847672"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our research has also highlighted some interesting solutions to the card holder, but none have been efficient enough nor provided an elegant design that any guy or girl would be proud to carry. My mission was to create a card holder that is ergonomic and cool at the same time.  </p>
<h2>What is RFID skimming?</h2>
<p>Today the world is moving away from transaction cards with a magnetic stripe to Smart Cards. These house a small RFID (Radio Frequency ID) chip which contains sensitive information about you and your account details and which can be easily skimmed. The banks and credit card companies will tell you that these Smart Cards are safe and secure.  <em><strong>They are not</strong>,</em> and if you are in any doubt of this, take a moment to watch this recent <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNvPI8VHjsM&amp;feature=plcp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube</a> clip.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Unless you are using a card holder that protects the cards you use everyday, there is always a risk of your personal and bank account details being stolen. </em></strong></h3>
<p>We have solved this potential threat simply, elegantly and innovatively with our <strong>NU Lifestyle RFID Blocking Card Holder </strong>that effectively forms a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Faraday Cage</a> around your cards and protects them from being unlawfully skimmed.</p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/571025/pictures/full/20121206184226-0113.jpg?1354848148"" src="""" style="""" title=""blblblba""/></h3>
<h2>Our Design Brief</h2>
<p>RFID theft and Fat Wallet Syndrome are just some of the issues we wanted to solve. Here’s our complete Design Brief:</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> RFID skimming protection. </p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Ergonomic low profile form designed for the human body.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> An emotional user experience through the use of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_perception"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Haptics</a>.  We wanted our Card Holders to not only look great and work well, but also feel great too. Our objective is to provide a satisfying emotional experience with every use. </p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Must accommodate 4 cards or 3 cards plus some cash notes. We discovered that this is the most ideal as the research supports, the average person uses up to 3 cards per day.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Must also be useable as a business card holder.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Elegant, sophisticated design that people would want to use and show their friends. </p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Customisable to individual taste and branding. </p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Consist of a range with a variety of models to suit all requirements and price points.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Suitable for males and females.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Suitable to be worn in front or rear pockets with equal comfort.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Fit into a ladies small evening bag.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Durable and robust design that will last for years.</p>
<h2><strong>THE SOLUTION - NU Lifestyle Card Holders</strong></h2>
<p>After three years of design and more than 100 prototypes, we have evolved our range of <strong><a href=""http://www.nulifestyle.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NU Lifestyle Card Holders</a></strong>. </p>
<p>We called the range <strong>NU</strong> which is French for naked or nude. <strong>NU Card Holders</strong> are simple, elegant and organic forms which incorporate minimalism and functionality. They are designed so that you won’t feel them in your pocket.</p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/570985/pictures/full/20121206181942-NUDE.jpg?1354846788"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We have trialled them on a number of people who have stated that the <strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holders</strong> felt sensual to hold and eliminated bulk in their essential everyday life. After experiencing the <strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holder</strong>, recipients have said that they will never use a conventional wallet again.</p>
<h2><strong>THE NU LIFESTYLE CARD HOLDER RANGE</strong></h2>
<p>We recognise that people’s needs and requirements are different, so we’ve developed a range of<strong> NU Lifestyle Card Holders </strong>to suit everyone.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h2>NU Uno - Non RFID Blocking Card Holder</h2>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/571099/pictures/full/20121206193633-0110.jpg?1354851398"" src="""" style=""""/> </div>
<div class=""template asset""> </div>
<div class=""template asset"">The <strong>NU Uno Card Holder</strong> is a solid one-piece construction manufactured in the highest quality, tough engineering grade polymers with pad printed branding. <strong>NU Uno</strong> is perfect for any cards where <strong><em>RFID security is not an issue</em></strong>, such as older magnetic stripe cards, as well as being a great business card holder.</div>
<div class=""template asset"">
<p>If you have kids, you’ll find that it's ideal for school library cards, proof of age cards and bus passes, keeping them together, safely.</p>
<p>Unlike other card holders that are usually made from an upper and lower moulding that are welded together, our <strong>NU Uno Card Holders</strong> are made in one piece so they are much stronger with no seams to split and crack. It sounds simple and obvious, but it’s actually quite difficult to do and more expensive to make than a two-piece moulded product. </p>
<div>
<strong>Nu Uno</strong> provides a far more durable and robust result that is worth the extra effort and expense.</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>NU Chroma - Non RFID Blocking Card Holder</h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/571100/pictures/full/20121206193643-0111.jpg?1354851406"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>The <strong>NU Chroma Card Holder</strong>, like the <strong>Uno</strong>, is a solid one piece construction manufactured in highest quality, tough engineering grade polymers with pad printed branding and also comes with a hand-polished chrome trim moulding for an added touch of elegance. Like our <strong>Uno</strong> model, <strong>Chroma</strong> is perfect for any cards where <strong><em>RFID security is not an issue</em></strong>, such as older magnetic stripe cards, as well as making a great business card holder.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>NU DuoChroma - RFID Blocking Card Holder</h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/571104/pictures/full/20121206193706-203.jpg?1354851432"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>We understand that not everyone can afford our premium aircraft-grade aluminium NU Persona RFID Blocking Card Holder. Which is why we created the <strong>Nu DuoChroma RFID Blocking</strong> card holder. It works just like the Persona range, the only difference is that it is made with a tough engineering grade polymer and then chrome plated to protect your cards from RFID skimming.  This means you can carry your most important cards with you every day, with confidence.    Choose between the sexy brushed satin chrome finish with bright chrome trim or the sleek brushed black chrome finish with bright chrome trim. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>NU Persona – RFID Blocking Card Holder</h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/571106/pictures/full/20121206193724-0112.jpg?1354851450"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>The <strong>NU Persona RFID Blocking Card Holder</strong> is our premium product. Made from aerospace grade aluminium, it effectively forms a Faraday Cage around your cards and protects them from being unlawfully skimmed. It is elegant, sophisticated, beautiful and sensual in use.  It is available in a range of anodised colours and finished with precision moulded edge trim features that are themselves available in a range of finishes to suit individual mood and style. You can choose from one of our standard <strong>NU Persona</strong> range, or our special IndieGogo Limited Edition range.   </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Introducing your NU bestie....</h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/571026/pictures/full/20121206184240-NU_-_her_and_him.jpg?1354848168"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Ladies, whether you are going shopping and want easy access to your loyalty cards or going out for the night, the <strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holders </strong>will not only lighten your load but offer you a practical and sexy sleek style while you’re on the go.</p>
<p>Shopping has finally become an easier experience. Instead of scrambling through your purse and getting lost in the abyss of multiple cards and receipts, <strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holders </strong>are easily located, helping you find the card you need fast.</p>
<p>If you’re going out for a drink or dinner and are tired of lugging your heavy wallet around, simply pop the essential cards and cash you need for the night in a hot <strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holder </strong>and eliminate bulk instantly. Slim and perfectly shaped, a <strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holder </strong>will fit in the smallest of clutches.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/571027/pictures/full/20121206184258-NU_-_her_and_him2.jpg?1354848183"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>Guys, protect your back, guard your cards and simplify your life.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Why is it curved?</h2>
<p>During the design of the <strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holders</strong>, we paid special attention to the ergonomics of the product.</p>
<p><strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holders</strong> are designed with a subtle curve so that it sits comfortably in your back or front pocket, making it unnoticeable.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/571348/pictures/full/20121206223641-photo7.jpg?1354862207"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<h2><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/571347/pictures/full/20121206223625-photo8.jpg?1354862189"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<p><em>NU Lifestyle Card Holders are virtually invisible in front or back pockets!</em></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Specifications (NU Persona Model)</h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/571023/pictures/full/20121206184205-0114.jpg?1354848131"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p><strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holders </strong>will comfortably hold 4 credit or debit cards or 3 cards plus some cash notes. </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Durability and Sustainability</h2>
<p>Unlike conventional leather wallets that degrade over time when exposed to moisture,  our range of <strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holders</strong> are durable and can be washed and wiped down if they get dirty. Being manufactured from premium polymers and aircraft grade aluminium they are kind to the environment and can be recycled at their end of life. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where will my money go?</h2>
<p>Product design and development is an expensive and time consuming process. Here are some areas where the IndieGogo funding will be spent. </p>
<p>• Tooling and jigs. While we have already paid for tooling for <strong>Uno,</strong> <strong>Chroma</strong> and <strong>DuoChroma</strong> and we need to commission tooling and production jigs for <strong>Persona</strong>. </p>
<p>• Minimum Order Quantities. Manufacturers require minimum quantities that must be paid for before they run the products. </p>
<p>• Patents. We have filed provisional patents to protect the intellectual property contained in our unique range of <strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holders</strong> and stop others from forging our concepts and designs. Our patents need to be filed in each country, which is a very costly but essential exercise.</p>
<p>• Design and development of packaging for each of the products in the range. </p>
<p>• Overseas development trips. Quality management and control is needed to ensure that the product we have designed is exactly the product you will receive. Over the coming months we will make several trips to China to oversee tooling and arrange production of the <strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holder </strong>range.</p>

<h2>Backer Perks</h2>
<p>We have a great range of Backer Perks that allow you to select the <strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holder</strong> that is just right for you at great IndieGogo backer prices.</p>

<h2>IndieGogo and you</h2>
<p>We’ve spent three years and tens of thousands of our own dollars designing, prototyping, testing and tooling our <strong>NU Uno,</strong> <strong>NU Chroma and NU DuoChroma Card Holders</strong>. We've produced a limited pilot production run to test real products in the real world and now we're ready to go into full scale production. We’ve also built and successfully tested more than 50 prototypes of our <strong>NU Persona RFID Blocking Card Holder</strong> and are now ready to start tooling. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/571001/pictures/full/20121206183515-photo4.jpg?1354847719"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>NU Persona prototype - Now ready for production</em></p>
<p>We love designing our own cool products that we believe you will enjoy and embrace.  Indiegogo is a great way for you to validate these product ideas and be a part of the development process. If you like our <strong>NU Lifestyle Card Holder</strong> range, please back us so we can get these great products into your hands sooner rather than in another few years time as we can afford it.  So please, help to back our project. Even if you can’t back our project personally, you can still help by spreading the word to your friends, family and social network. </p>

The banks and credit card companies will tell you that these Smart Cards are safe and secure.  They are not, and if you are in any doubt of this, take a moment to watch this recent YouTube clip.
Unless you are using a card holder that protects the cards you use everyday, there is always a risk of your personal and bank account details being stolen. 
We have solved this potential threat simply, elegantly and innovatively with our NU Lifestyle RFID Blocking Card Holder that effectively forms a Faraday Cage around your cards and protects them from being unlawfully skimmed.

Our Design Brief
RFID theft and Fat Wallet Syndrome are just some of the issues we wanted to solve. Here’s our complete Design Brief:
• RFID skimming protection. 
• Ergonomic low profile form designed for the human body.
• An emotional user experience through the use of Haptics.  We wanted our Card Holders to not only look great and work well, but also feel great too. Our objective is to provide a satisfying emotional experience with every use. 
• Must accommodate 4 cards or 3 cards plus some cash notes. We discovered that this is the most ideal as the research supports, the average person uses up to 3 cards per day.
• Must also be useable as a business card holder.
• Elegant, sophisticated design that people would want to use and show their friends. 
• Customisable to individual taste and branding. 
• Consist of a range with a variety of models to suit all requirements and price points.
• Suitable for males and females.
• Suitable to be worn in front or rear pockets with equal comfort.
• Fit into a ladies small evening bag.
• Durable and robust design that will last for years.
THE SOLUTION - NU Lifestyle Card Holders
After three years of design and more than 100 prototypes, we have evolved our range of NU Lifestyle Card Holders. 
We called the range NU which is French for naked or nude. NU Card Holders are simple, elegant and organic forms which incorporate minimalism and functionality. They are designed so that you won’t feel them in your pocket.
 
We have trialled them on a number of people who have stated that the NU Lifestyle Card Holders felt sensual to hold and eliminated bulk in their essential everyday life. After experiencing the NU Lifestyle Card Holder, recipients have said that they will never use a conventional wallet again.
THE NU LIFESTYLE CARD HOLDER RANGE
We recognise that people’s needs and requirements are different, so we’ve developed a range of NU Lifestyle Card Holders to suit everyone.
 

NU Uno - Non RFID Blocking Card Holder

 
 
The NU Uno Card Holder is a solid one-piece construction manufactured in the highest quality, tough engineering grade polymers with pad printed branding. NU Uno is perfect for any cards where RFID security is not an issue, such as older magnetic stripe cards, as well as being a great business card holder.

If you have kids, you’ll find that it's ideal for school library cards, proof of age cards and bus passes, keeping them together, safely.
Unlike other card holders that are usually made from an upper and lower moulding that are welded together, our NU Uno Card Holders are made in one piece so they are much stronger with no seams to split and crack. It sounds simple and obvious, but it’s actually quite difficult to do and more expensive to make than a two-piece moulded product. 

Nu Uno provides a far more durable and robust result that is worth the extra effort and expense.


 
NU Chroma - Non RFID Blocking Card Holder
 
The NU Chroma Card Holder, like the Uno, is a solid one piece construction manufactured in highest quality, tough engineering grade polymers with pad printed branding and also comes with a hand-polished chrome trim moulding for an added touch of elegance. Like our Uno model, Chroma is perfect for any cards where RFID security is not an issue, such as older magnetic stripe cards, as well as making a great business card holder.
 
NU DuoChroma - RFID Blocking Card Holder
 
We understand that not everyone can afford our premium aircraft-grade aluminium NU Persona RFID Blocking Card Holder. Which is why we created the Nu DuoChroma RFID Blocking card holder. It works just like the Persona range, the only difference is that it is made with a tough engineering grade polymer and then chrome plated to protect your cards from RFID skimming.  This means you can carry your most important cards with you every day, with confidence.    Choose between the sexy brushed satin chrome finish with bright chrome trim or the sleek brushed black chrome finish with bright chrome trim. 
 
NU Persona – RFID Blocking Card Holder
 
The NU Persona RFID Blocking Card Holder is our premium product. Made from aerospace grade aluminium, it effectively forms a Faraday Cage around your cards and protects them from being unlawfully skimmed. It is elegant, sophisticated, beautiful and sensual in use.  It is available in a range of anodised colours and finished with precision moulded edge trim features that are themselves available in a range of finishes to suit individual mood and style. You can choose from one of our standard NU Persona range, or our special IndieGogo Limited Edition range.   
 
Introducing your NU bestie....

Ladies, whether you are going shopping and want easy access to your loyalty cards or going out for the night, the NU Lifestyle Card Holders will not only lighten your load but offer you a practical and sexy sleek style while you’re on the go.
Shopping has finally become an easier experience. Instead of scrambling through your purse and getting lost in the abyss of multiple cards and receipts, NU Lifestyle Card Holders are easily located, helping you find the card you need fast.
If you’re going out for a drink or dinner and are tired of lugging your heavy wallet around, simply pop the essential cards and cash you need for the night in a hot NU Lifestyle Card Holder and eliminate bulk instantly. Slim and perfectly shaped, a NU Lifestyle Card Holder will fit in the smallest of clutches.
 
Guys, protect your back, guard your cards and simplify your life.
 

Why is it curved?
During the design of the NU Lifestyle Card Holders, we paid special attention to the ergonomics of the product.
NU Lifestyle Card Holders are designed with a subtle curve so that it sits comfortably in your back or front pocket, making it unnoticeable.
 

NU Lifestyle Card Holders are virtually invisible in front or back pockets!
 
Specifications (NU Persona Model)
 
NU Lifestyle Card Holders will comfortably hold 4 credit or debit cards or 3 cards plus some cash notes. 
 
Durability and Sustainability
Unlike conventional leather wallets that degrade over time when exposed to moisture,  our range of NU Lifestyle Card Holders are durable and can be washed and wiped down if they get dirty. Being manufactured from premium polymers and aircraft grade aluminium they are kind to the environment and can be recycled at their end of life. 
 
Where will my money go?
Product design and development is an expensive and time consuming process. Here are some areas where the IndieGogo funding will be spent. 
• Tooling and jigs. While we have already paid for tooling for Uno, Chroma and DuoChroma and we need to commission tooling and production jigs for Persona. 
• Minimum Order Quantities. Manufacturers require minimum quantities that must be paid for before they run the products. 
• Patents. We have filed provisional patents to protect the intellectual property contained in our unique range of NU Lifestyle Card Holders and stop others from forging our concepts and designs. Our patents need to be filed in each country, which is a very costly but essential exercise.
• Design and development of packaging for each of the products in the range. 
• Overseas development trips. Quality management and control is needed to ensure that the product we have designed is exactly the product you will receive. Over the coming months we will make several trips to China to oversee tooling and arrange production of the NU Lifestyle Card Holder range.
 
Backer Perks
We have a great range of Backer Perks that allow you to select the NU Lifestyle Card Holder that is just right for you at great IndieGogo backer prices.








 
IndieGogo and you
We’ve spent three years and tens of thousands of our own dollars designing, prototyping, testing and tooling our NU Uno, NU Chroma and NU DuoChroma Card Holders. We've produced a limited pilot production run to test real products in the real world and now we're ready to go into full scale production. We’ve also built and successfully tested more than 50 prototypes of our NU Persona RFID Blocking Card Holder and are now ready to start tooling. 

NU Persona prototype - Now ready for production
We love designing our own cool products that we believe you will enjoy and embrace.  Indiegogo is a great way for you to validate these product ideas and be a part of the development process. If you like our NU Lifestyle Card Holder range, please back us so we can get these great products into your hands sooner rather than in another few years time as we can afford it.  So please, help to back our project. Even if you can’t back our project personally, you can still help by spreading the word to your friends, family and social network. 
PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO MANUALLY ADD THE SHIPPING COST TO YOUR TOTAL WHEN CHECKING OUT!

<h3>About this Campaign</h3>
<p>Collected money will be used to build a board based on FPGA chip XC6SLX9 and needed firmware for it,  capable to display images in resolution SVGA and up - aiming at 1280x800, keeping in mind that it needs to have a simple interface and be easy to use with any microcontroller.

เมื่อช่วงต้นปี 2014 ทางเราได้ปล่อย ATH Stock Analysis บน App Store แล้ว ได้รับความนิยม และเสียงตอบรับอย่างดีจากนักลงทุนเป็นจำนวนมาก โดยแรกเริ่มนั้นทางเราต้องการให้ ATH Stock Analysis แจกฟรีสำหรับทุกๆคน แต่มาทราบในภายหลังว่าการนำข้อมูลมาเผยแพร่ต่อนั้น ต้องมีค่าใช้จ่ายถึงเดือนละ 30,000 บาท ดังนั้นเพื่อให้คุณได้รับข้อมูล บทวิเคราะห์ที่เป็นประโยชน์การลงทุนของคุณ เราจึงอยากให้ช่วยสนับสนุน แอพลิเคชันนี้ ซึ่งเป็นค่าสมาชิกในราคาพิเศษ และมีจำนวนจำกัด โดยทางเราจะนำเงินที่ได้รับไปจ่ายเป็นค่าเผยแพร่ข้อมูลให้กับทาง Settrade เป็นรายปี (ประมาณ 360,000 บาท)
  คุณจะได้อะไรจากการสนับสนุนเรา ?  คุณจะได้รับข้อมูล account สำหรับการเข้าใช้งาน ATH Stock Analysis ได้ทั้งบน ระบบ iOS และ Android เป็นเวลา 2 ปี ในราคาเพียง 1 ปี ซึ่งเป็นราคาพิเศษสุดๆ ลด 50% คือจ่ายเพียง 1,200 บาท จากราคาปกติ 2,400 บาท เฉลี่ยเพียงเดือนละ 50 บาทโดยผู้ที่มาซื้อภายหลังจากจบการระดมทุนบน Indiegogo แล้วจะไม่ได้รับสิทธิ์นี้และต้องจ่ายราคาเต็ม (1,200 บาท ต่อ 1 ปี) เฉลี่ย 100 บาท ต่อเดือน
  ความเสี่ยง 
โปรเจคนี้มีความเสี่ยงต่ำเนื่องจากตัวแอพลิเคชัน ATH Stock Analysis นั้นทำการพัฒนาเสร็จเรียบร้อย สามารถใช้งานจริงได้แล้ว ทั้งบน iPhone และ Android โดยบน iPhone และ iPad นั้นทางเราได้เคยนำขึ้นบน App Store แล้ว แต่มีปัญหาเรื่องสิทธิ์ในการนำข้อมูลเผยแพร่ จึงต้องนำลงจาก App Store",6.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, we are an ambitious little company called Nascent. The idea of a world with less waste, cooler stuff, and lower costs for better devices sounds like a pretty nice place to live.</p>
<p>Do you agree?</p>
<p>I Had a feeling you would. :-)</p>
<p>Nascent is a system of interchangeable pieces that snap together to form different gadgets in the matter of moments. </p>
<p>We scoured the web and landed on 600 typical electronic products. We were dumbfounded to learn that a system of only 15 modular parts could ""build"" the lion's share of them. </p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 28px;"">We Want To Help You Live BIG With <br/>A Lot Less Waste</span></h3>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If you are the type of person who cares about the environment and likes to enjoy the latest in cool technology, I have a feeling we are all going to get along just fine.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>You and I “Get” that filling landfills with outdated gadgets is about as smart as busting the budget on the latest flavor of gadget just because it has one new feature.</p>
<p>Just Go Modular and grab only the new feature, less for the landfills, less money out of your pocket, and more awesomeness from your gadgets.</p>
<p>Neat huh? :-)</p>
<p>With the Nascent system, you're not stuck with single-use products that go obsolete almost overnight, but rather you extend the life of your gadgets, reuse pieces to reduce waste and get more for less money.</p>
<p></p>

Hi, we are an ambitious little company called Nascent. The idea of a world with less waste, cooler stuff, and lower costs for better devices sounds like a pretty nice place to live.
Do you agree?
I Had a feeling you would. :-)
Nascent is a system of interchangeable pieces that snap together to form different gadgets in the matter of moments. 
We scoured the web and landed on 600 typical electronic products. We were dumbfounded to learn that a system of only 15 modular parts could ""build"" the lion's share of them. 

We Want To Help You Live BIG With A Lot Less Waste

If you are the type of person who cares about the environment and likes to enjoy the latest in cool technology, I have a feeling we are all going to get along just fine.

You and I “Get” that filling landfills with outdated gadgets is about as smart as busting the budget on the latest flavor of gadget just because it has one new feature.
Just Go Modular and grab only the new feature, less for the landfills, less money out of your pocket, and more awesomeness from your gadgets.
Neat huh? :-)
With the Nascent system, you're not stuck with single-use products that go obsolete almost overnight, but rather you extend the life of your gadgets, reuse pieces to reduce waste and get more for less money.





Go Modular Today

We are launching the Nascent system with a bundle of 3 useful home gadgets. The bundle includes 5 modules and 3 shapes that combine to make 3 different useful gadgets for the price of 1:  


By backing this campaign you will be among the first to get access to this modular system and will be first in line for new products as they become available.


Meet the Gadgets!

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> <span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">My Job is technical support for comcast. What I want to do is be a writer, a graphic designer, a game designer and an inventor. I'm going to be going to college for networking and computer science.  The invention I'm coming to you with is a Finger-Mapped Keyboard for Tablet devices.</span></span></span></p>

<h2 class=""western""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">What's so special about finger-mapped keyboards?</span></span></span></h2>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">When you think about it, a tablet shouldn't require an add-on to have a keyboard that is quick and comfortable. A tablet also shouldn't require a user to put the tablet down to type on in a classical keyboard type fashion. Tablets are now mainstream data devices that should be quick, on the go, data centers that send and receive data faster than a computer. Finger mapping the keyboard to the hand gives the user an entire keyboard for one hand so that the tablet can be held with the other hand. They also provide a personalized scale so that a man with large hands or a woman with smaller hands can use the same exact tablet and same exact app and still write in comfort without cramping on keys too small or stretching for keys too large.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">I've been quoted prices from developers who want $30+ an hour and quote development time close to 120 hours. I personally have close to 900 dollars that I plan to invest in this project and I am in need of more to even have this project started. I am a worker, trying to go to college and support my girlfriend who goes to school and interns full time. While I believe my idea is unique and I have found no other like it I do believe it is just a matter of time before someones else creates something like it. I plan to release the first version to the android market, and then afterward to the IOs and finally the Windows 8 version. The full price of all 3 versions comes to approximately 12,000 dollars but I just want a start with the android.</span></span></span></p>

To prove this, once my funding reaches its goals I'll tell the developers to start and for your funding I'll provide special perks like:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">-Being the very first to receive and test the beta once the app is ready. 2-3 weeks after goal is reached</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">I'm all in on this, I'm only asking for the bare minimum of what I need. If I don't make my goal there’s no reason for me to keep that money you have donated. You get it all back, and I'll move forward.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> </span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">The world of computers is changing; with that change, the way we use them will also change.

</div></div>","Hi may name is Jason,
 My Job is technical support for comcast. What I want to do is be a writer, a graphic designer, a game designer and an inventor. I'm going to be going to college for networking and computer science.  The invention I'm coming to you with is a Finger-Mapped Keyboard for Tablet devices.
 
What's so special about finger-mapped keyboards?
When you think about it, a tablet shouldn't require an add-on to have a keyboard that is quick and comfortable. A tablet also shouldn't require a user to put the tablet down to type on in a classical keyboard type fashion. Tablets are now mainstream data devices that should be quick, on the go, data centers that send and receive data faster than a computer. Finger mapping the keyboard to the hand gives the user an entire keyboard for one hand so that the tablet can be held with the other hand. They also provide a personalized scale so that a man with large hands or a woman with smaller hands can use the same exact tablet and same exact app and still write in comfort without cramping on keys too small or stretching for keys too large.
 
Why $3,500?
I've been quoted prices from developers who want $30+ an hour and quote development time close to 120 hours. I personally have close to 900 dollars that I plan to invest in this project and I am in need of more to even have this project started. I am a worker, trying to go to college and support my girlfriend who goes to school and interns full time. While I believe my idea is unique and I have found no other like it I do believe it is just a matter of time before someones else creates something like it. I plan to release the first version to the android market, and then afterward to the IOs and finally the Windows 8 version. The full price of all 3 versions comes to approximately 12,000 dollars but I just want a start with the android.
 
Why me and what's in it for you?
I want this to be just the beginning, I want to have more interactive and futurist designs and interfaces for people who want to enter their data faster, who want a more complete interface and who want to live on the edge of technology. To prove this, once my funding reaches its goals I'll tell the developers to start and for your funding I'll provide special perks like:
-Being the very first to receive and test the beta once the app is ready. 2-3 weeks after goal is reached
-Receiving customizable skins for the app to show your brand loyalty. Choose which one looks best and that will be in the final version.
What Happens If I don't make my funding mark?
I'm all in on this, I'm only asking for the bare minimum of what I need. If I don't make my goal there’s no reason for me to keep that money you have donated. You get it all back, and I'll move forward.
 
I can't do this without you.
The world of computers is changing; with that change, the way we use them will also change. I believe the app and design is going to be a staple of touch screen interface. Technology is synonymous with ease of use. Classic keyboards will fade away as a design and much easier to use interfaces will appear. I'm asking you to be a part of revolutionizing a new way for this interface and a new way for touch interfaces to go to the next level. This is a chance for you to be a part of it.
 
Can't donate?
I understand if you can't but if you think this is idea is cool or has some merit please do me a favor and share it so maybe one of your friends may be able to.
 
This is my dream, design and work.
I came up with this idea, I've drawn and designed it and right now that’s as far as it has gotten. I would love nothing more than to have this dream fully realized with a working prototype and video of how it works. But right now I don't have the resources and it is just a dream, and just a design. I want to put in the hard work and bring to you the fully functioning product. Once my goal is reached I will love to share my work.
Thank you so much for your time! Thank you so much for your support!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello, we are Robby Erskine, Bobby Schmitt, and Jack Clare.
We are three Bellarmine University students with the passion to invent
something that matters. We first started our partnership by contemplating
problems in our everyday lives. We arrived at the issue of texting and driving
and how so many people get injured or even die from it every year. We wanted to come up with a way
to 100% guarantee that people would not use their phones while behind the
wheel. We came up with a way to guarantee this; make a phone case that holds
your car key. This way your key along with your phone is required in the engine
to start the car. </p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1065467/files/20141202111944-DSC_Logo.png?1417547984"" src="""" style=""width: 544px; height: 544px;""/></p><p>The Drive Safe Case could change the world, if widely
accepted it could completely eliminate texting and driving.  In order to make the Drive Safe Case a world

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>If we receive funding we will have plenty of things to put
it towards. We will first develop multiple plastic molds of the product and have
potential customers test them out to see which is preferred. Once we purchase
the materials required to make them and start producing the product we will
have to partner with a company to help us manufacture our product. The Drive
Safe Case will do more than just prevent the use of your phone while driving.
The case will be as sturdy as an Otterbox while also eliminating the need for a
key chain. We will also look into developing other products such as wallet
cases that will still function as a key holder as well.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1072008/files/20141204142019-Untitled.jpg?1417731619"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">TAIJI means TAICHI. TAIJIUINO Due board derives from Arduino Due. Compared with Arduino Due, we made some changes and improvement. But it is completely compatible with Arduino Due. Users could write code and program it in Arduino IDE.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The TAIJIUINO Due is a microcontroller board based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU (<a href=""http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc11057.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">datasheet</a>).It has 74 (20 more than Arduino Due) digital input/output pins (of which 12 can be used as PWM outputs), 12 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 84 MHz clock, an USB OTG capable connection, 2 DAC (digital to analog), 2 TWI, a power jack, an SPI header, a JTAG header, a reset button and an erase button.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The board contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a micro-USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. This board is compatible with all Arduino shields that work at 3.3V and are compliant with the 1.0 Arduino pinout.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The Due follows the 1.0 pinout:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">TWI: SDA and SCL pins that are near to the AREF pin.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The IOREF pin which allows an attached shield with the proper configuration to adapt to the voltage provided by the board. This enables shield compatibility with a 3.3V board like the Due and AVR-based boards which operate at 5V.</span></li>

<h3><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Power</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The TAIJIUINO Due Pro can be powered via the USB connector or with an external power supply. The power source is selected automatically.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">External (non-USB) power can come either from an AC-to-DC adapter (wall-wart) or battery. The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug into the board's power jack. Leads from a battery can be inserted in the Gnd and Vin pin headers of the POWER connector.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The board can operate on an external supply of 6 to 24 volts. If supplied with less than 7V, however, the 5V pin may supply less than five volts and the board may be unstable. If using more than 12V, the voltage regulator may overheat and damage the board. The recommended range is 7 to 12 volts.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The power pins are as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>VIN.</strong> The input voltage to the TAIJIUINO board when it's using an external power source (as opposed to 5 volts from the USB connection or other regulated power source). You can supply voltage through this pin, or if supplying voltage via the power jack, access it through this pin.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>5V.</strong> This pin outputs a regulated 5V from the regulator on the board. The board can be supplied with power either from the DC power jack (7 - 12V), the USB connector (5V), or the VIN pin of the board (7-12V). Supplying voltage via the 5V or 3.3V pins bypasses the regulator, and can damage your board. We don't advise it.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>3.3V.</strong> A 3.3 volt supply generated by the on-board regulator. Maximum current draw is 800 mA. This regulator also provides the power supply to the SAM3X microcontroller.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>GND.</strong> Ground pins.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>IOREF.</strong> This pin on the TAIJIUINO board provides the voltage reference with which the microcontroller operates. A properly configured shield can read the IOREF pin voltage and select the appropriate power source or enable voltage translators on the outputs for working with the 5V or 3.3V.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Memory</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The SAM3X has 512 KB (2 blocks of 256 KB) of flash memory for storing code. The bootloader is preburned in factory from Atmel and is stored in a dedicated ROM memory. The available SRAM is 96 KB in two contiguous bank of 64 KB and 32 KB. All the available memory (Flash, RAM and ROM) can be accessed directly as a flat addressing space.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">It is possible to erase the Flash memory of the SAM3X with the onboard erase button. This will remove the currently loaded sketch from the MCU. To erase, press and hold the Erase button for a few seconds while the board is powered.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Input and Output</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Digital I/O: pins from 0 to 53</strong><br/>Each of the 54 digital pins on the Due can be used as an input or output, using <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/PinMode"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pinMode()</a>, <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/DigitalWrite"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">digitalWrite()</a>, and <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/DigitalRead"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">digitalRead()</a> functions. They operate at 3.3 volts. Each pin can provide (source) a current of 3 mA or 15 mA, depending on the pin, or receive (sink) a current of 6 mA or 9 mA, depending on the pin. They also have an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 100 KOhm. In addition, some pins have specialized functions:</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Serial: 0 (RX) and 1 (TX)</strong></span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Serial 1: 19 (RX) and 18 (TX)</strong></span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Serial 2: 17 (RX) and 16 (TX)</strong></span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Serial 3: 15 (RX) and 14 (TX)</strong> <br/>Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data (with 3.3 V level).</span></li>

The SPI header can be used only to communicate with other SPI devices, not for programming the SAM3X with the In-Circuit-Serial-Programming technique. The SPI of the Due has also advanced features that can be used with the <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/DueExtendedSPI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Extended SPI methods for Due</a>.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>CAN: CANRX and CANTX</strong> <br/>These pins support the CAN communication protocol but are not not yet supported by Arduino APIs.</span></li>

<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Analog Inputs: pins from A0 to A11</strong> <br/>The Due has 12 analog inputs, each of which can provide 12 bits of resolution (i.e. 4096 different values). By default, the resolution of the readings is set at 10 bits, for compatibility with other Arduino boards. It is possible to change the resolution of the ADC with<a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogReadResolution"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">analogReadResolution()</a>. The Due’s analog inputs pins measure from ground to a maximum value of 3.3V. Applying more then 3.3V on the Due’s pins will damage the SAM3X chip. The analogReference() function is ignored on the Due.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The AREF pin is connected to the SAM3X analog reference pin through a resistor bridge. To use the AREF pin, resistorBR1 must be desoldered from the PCB.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>DAC1 and DAC2</strong> <br/>These pins provides true analog outputs with 12-bits resolution (4096 levels) with the <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogWrite"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">analogWrite()</a> function.

<h3><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Communication</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The Taijiuino Due Pro has a number of facilities for communicating with a computer, another Arduino or other microcontrollers, and different devices like phones, tablets, cameras and so on. The SAM3X provides one hardware UART and three hardware USARTs for TTL (3.3V) serial communication.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The programming pins are broken out for external program downloaders. Among those pins, the TXD and RXD pins are 5V TTL UART port, which are connect to TX0 and RX0 pins on Taijiuino Due through a 5V-3V3 TTL shifter.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The Native USB port is connected to the SAM3X. It allows for serial (CDC) communication over USB. This provides a serial connection to the Serial Monitor or other applications on your computer. It also enables the Due to emulate a USB mouse or keyboard to an attached computer. To use these features, see the <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/MouseKeyboard"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mouse and Keyboard library reference pages</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The Native USB port can also act as a USB host for connected peripherals such as mice, keyboards, and smartphones. To use these features, see the <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/USBHost"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">USBHost reference pages</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The Native USB port can also be used as a virtual serial port. Instead of using ""<strong>Serial</strong>"" object, use the ""<strong>SerialUSB</strong>"" object in the Arduino programming language, for example, <strong>SerialUSB.read()</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The SAM3X also supports TWI and SPI communication. The Arduino software includes a Wire library to simplify use of the TWI bus; see the <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">documentation</a> for details. For SPI communication, use the <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/SPI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SPI library</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Programming</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The TAIJIUINO Due Pro can be programmed with the Arduino software (<a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Main/SoftwareDue"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">download</a>). For details, see the <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">reference</a> and<a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> tutorials</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Uploading sketches to the SAM3X is different than the AVR microcontrollers found in other Arduino boards because the flash memory needs to be erased before being re-programmed. Upload to the chip is managed by ROM on theSAM3X, which is run only when the chip's flash memory is empty.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">There are two ways to program the boards:</span></p>

<li><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Native port: to use this port, select ""TAIJIUINO Due Pro (Native USB Port)"" as your board in the Arduino IDE. The Native USB port is connected directly to the SAM3X. Connect the Due's Native USB port (the one closest to the reset button) to your computer. Opening and closing the Native port at 1200bps triggers a 'soft erase' procedure: the flash memory is erased and the board is restarted with the bootloader. If the MCU crashed for some reason it is likely that the soft erase procedure won't work as this procedure happens entirely in software on the SAM3X. Opening and closing the native port at a different baudrate will not reset the SAM3X.</span></li>

<h2><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Why we fund here?</span></h2>
<h3><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">To let more users have a board like Arduino Due</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Arduino Due is a great board, more powerful than its predecessors. However, due to expensive chips and components, the board is very expensive. We aim to have more people be able to afford this board. To reduce the cost, our hardware designer spent much time on resigning the schematic, while keeping the same or even better performance. For example, we replace the expensive <a href=""http://elechouse.com/elechouse/5.0%22%20TFT%20LCD%20and%20Shield%20for%20Arduino%20DUE,%20with%20SD%20&amp;%20Touch%20control"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LM2734Y</a> with <a href=""http://www.monolithicpower.com/Page/DownLoad.aspx?ListID=149b7d2b-0bb2-4ba6-a219-a0495acb8b0b&amp;&amp;ItemID=10"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MP2359</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">We all know that cost of production could be greatly reduced if the quantity rises up. </span><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">We aim to produce more than 1000 pcs one time. We've reached agreement with the supplier and assembling factory. If we make more than 1000pcs, they could offer better price.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">To rise fund for our future products</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">We are a group of technique guys. We love Arduino and make various modules for it. We have many ideas about new modules for Arduino Due. So far we designed several modules or boards for Arduino Due. However, due to weak marketing skills and limited finance, we could not populate our products to Arduino users. We got pressure to move on. We need fund for further products.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">We have the following ideas for future products:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">1. Taijiuino Ethernet = Taijiuino Due + PHY Ethernet Module. It is an real Arduino-Due-compatible board you could connect to network devices through a RJ45 cable.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">2. Taijiuino Smart House: this is a board for developing intelligence housing system. The board could access wifi or Ethernet network. What's really amazing is that, you could design your controlling UI easily, without any requirement on network or phone programming. If you know how to program Arduino, you could use it. Most important, no matter your device is Phone, Android, windows or linux, it could work for all.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">3. Network NFC device: this is a device reading / writing RFID card. It could also send/receive message from smart phone via NFC. The device could access Ethernet or wife network. It is really a useful device for Iota.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">All the designing work has been finished. The PCB board is ready for manufacturing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Once we reached our fund goal, manufacturing work begins.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">During the first 14 days (National Day Holiday will take 3 days off), the PCB manufacturer will produce and test the boards. At the same time, we will order and collect all the components.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">During the following 14 days, the manufacturing plant will run the SMT assembling, DIP components soldering and deliver the boards to us. At the same time, we will collect materials for shipping.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">During the following 7 days, we will test all the boards. Meanwhile, we will ship every days after testing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The whole shipping process takes around 2 weeks. We will try our best to ship out all the boards within 7 days after testing process ends.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">In case the interest we receive is higher than what we expected, we will update the output capacity. The time will not take longer.</span></p>

Introduce to this board
TAIJI means TAICHI. TAIJIUINO Due board derives from Arduino Due. Compared with Arduino Due, we made some changes and improvement. But it is completely compatible with Arduino Due. Users could write code and program it in Arduino IDE.
The TAIJIUINO Due is a microcontroller board based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU (datasheet).It has 74 (20 more than Arduino Due) digital input/output pins (of which 12 can be used as PWM outputs), 12 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 84 MHz clock, an USB OTG capable connection, 2 DAC (digital to analog), 2 TWI, a power jack, an SPI header, a JTAG header, a reset button and an erase button.
The board contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a micro-USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. This board is compatible with all Arduino shields that work at 3.3V and are compliant with the 1.0 Arduino pinout.
The Due follows the 1.0 pinout:

TWI: SDA and SCL pins that are near to the AREF pin.
The IOREF pin which allows an attached shield with the proper configuration to adapt to the voltage provided by the board. This enables shield compatibility with a 3.3V board like the Due and AVR-based boards which operate at 5V.
An unconnected pin, reserved for future use



Improvement and Difference from Arduino DUE

Ethernet interface on the ATSAM3X8E microcontroller is now available on Taijiuino
An oscillator for RTC is built in
Removed the Programming USB Port and added breakout programming pins for external programmer.
Unlike Arduino Due, all pins on the ATSAM3X8E microcontroller are accessible
Freed up pin 13 by removing the LED on it
Gold-plated PCB
5V Serial interface is available


Ethernet
ATmel ATSAM3X-EK has the same family ARM chip with Arduino Due. And AVR studio already has complete library for TCP/IP protocol. It is a pity that those pins for Ethernet are not available on Arduino Due. That's what persuaded us to design a different board. In fact, developers are already developing Ethernet library for Arduino Due. Please visit this page: Connecting an Ethernet PHY to Arduino Due
The following picture shows a webpage in Taijiuino.


To connect with Taijiuino Due in to Ethernet network, an Ethernet PHY module is needed. We've already made one for Taijiuino. Users only need to plug in an play:



Please note that currently the Ethernet library for Arduino DUE is still in developing by the 3rd party. If you are not capable to develop the library, temporarily you may don't need this module.
For more information, please refer to the following links:

Ethernet PHY module

Unfinished library page (not developers' official page)


Remove Programming USB Port
Users could program Arduino Due through either of the 2 USB port: Native USB, Programming USB.
On Taijiuino Due board, We removed Programming USB for the following reason:

Save space for Ethernet Pins
Users could program the board through Native USB port
If necessary, users could choose external program downloaders.

Taijiuino Due has pins for external program downloaders. Those pins include 5V TTL UART port. It could invoke more innovation to programming methods. For example, it makes the following possible: programming wirelessly, programming offline.
External program downloader is more cost-efficient. Similar with boards such as Arduino Mini or Arduino Pro, many boards could share one external program downloaders.
We've already developed 2 kinds of program downloaders:

External Program Downloader (DUE_PROG)
We designed this downloader for Taijiuino. It is plug and play.


This downloader is designed based on the ATmega16U2. With the bended-pin female header, users could plug in the header to Taijiuino Due board.  In fact, this downloader module could program any Arduino board. And it also could serves as USB-TTL module.
You could get more information about it from this page.
It works like USB Serial Light Adapter.
DUE WIRELESS PROG

You could get this product from Wireless program Downloader
This module could program the Taijiuino board wirelessly or send data between Taijiuino and PC wirelessly.
More pins
The chip ATSAM3X8E has several pins which are not available on Arduino. However, on Taijiuino Due, users could access those pins.

User could control those pins just as other Arduino pins:
// All this three lines do the same thing pinMode(PB23, OUTPUT); pinMode(103, OUTPUT); pinMode(TP0, OUTPUT);
// All this three lines do the same thing digitalWrite(PB23, HIGH); digitalWrite(103, HIGH); digitalWrite(TP0, HIGH);
For more information, please refer to our Github page.
Remove the led to pin 13
Led on Pin 13 might be helpful sometimes. We found that both PC30 and PA23 connected with LEDs. Users could use those 2 leds instead of led on Pin 13. So we remove the led on pin 13 to keep the board more simple.
In fact, for Arduino Due or Taijiuino Due, the leds are connected to Pin 72 and Pin 73. You could refer to this page to learn how to control the 2 leds.
More color
We could produce boards in 4 colors: red, black, white and blue.

Note that the white color has chromatic aberration. This is the 3D view picture. The real white board should looks like this one.
We could produce the board of any color above only if the quantity of one board boards is over 100pcs. If blue boards sponsors required are over 100pcs, we would produce blue boards. If not over 100pcs, we will not produce it and ship white boards instead.
Customize Your Arduino board
It is Taijiuino. However, it could be Anyduino.

It could be Aduino.
It could be Bduino.
It could be Jack.
It could be Lucy.

It could be named as anything you want.
We offer customization service for you. You could have your truly own Arduino board.
A gift for an electronic enthusiast? Excellent choice!!!


Very Important Note
We offer board customization service only if the interest on this service is over 50 copies. If finally the interest is not over 50 copies, we will contact you for either of the following solutions:

Sent you 13pcs Taijiuino Due boards
Send you other products we have
Refund you the money

Customization rules

Customization service starts with 10pcs. Sample PCB manufacturing charges the same price under 1pcs. We will make 10pcs PCB for each customization order.
The board could be made in 4 kinds of color: red, white, blue and black. You could choose any color for your board. But your 10pcs boards should be in one color.
Due to manufacturing yield problem, about 1% customization order will not get enough 10pcs but 9pcs or less. If only 9pcs boards get through the testing, we will ship one kit (Taijiuino + Downloader) instead. If only 8pcs boards get through the testing, we will ship 2 kits (Taijiuino + Downloader) and Sensor Shield instead. If less than 8pcs get through the testing, we will contact you.

Technique Detail
Warning: same with Arduino Due, Taijiuino Due runs at 3.3V. The maximum voltage that the I/O pins can tolerate is 3.3V. Providing higher voltages, like 5V to an I/O pin may damage the board.
ARM Core benefits
The Due has a 32-bit ARM core that can outperform typical 8-bit microcontroller boards. The most significant differences are:

A 32-bit core, that allows operations on 4 bytes wide data within a single CPU clock. (for more information look int type page).
CPU Clock at 84Mhz.
96 KBytes of SRAM.
512 KBytes of Flash memory for code.
a DMA controller, that can relieve the CPU from doing memory intensive tasks.

Power
The TAIJIUINO Due Pro can be powered via the USB connector or with an external power supply. The power source is selected automatically.
External (non-USB) power can come either from an AC-to-DC adapter (wall-wart) or battery. The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug into the board's power jack. Leads from a battery can be inserted in the Gnd and Vin pin headers of the POWER connector.
The board can operate on an external supply of 6 to 24 volts. If supplied with less than 7V, however, the 5V pin may supply less than five volts and the board may be unstable. If using more than 12V, the voltage regulator may overheat and damage the board. The recommended range is 7 to 12 volts.
The power pins are as follows:

VIN. The input voltage to the TAIJIUINO board when it's using an external power source (as opposed to 5 volts from the USB connection or other regulated power source). You can supply voltage through this pin, or if supplying voltage via the power jack, access it through this pin.
5V. This pin outputs a regulated 5V from the regulator on the board. The board can be supplied with power either from the DC power jack (7 - 12V), the USB connector (5V), or the VIN pin of the board (7-12V). Supplying voltage via the 5V or 3.3V pins bypasses the regulator, and can damage your board. We don't advise it.
3.3V. A 3.3 volt supply generated by the on-board regulator. Maximum current draw is 800 mA. This regulator also provides the power supply to the SAM3X microcontroller.
GND. Ground pins.
IOREF. This pin on the TAIJIUINO board provides the voltage reference with which the microcontroller operates. A properly configured shield can read the IOREF pin voltage and select the appropriate power source or enable voltage translators on the outputs for working with the 5V or 3.3V.

Memory
The SAM3X has 512 KB (2 blocks of 256 KB) of flash memory for storing code. The bootloader is preburned in factory from Atmel and is stored in a dedicated ROM memory. The available SRAM is 96 KB in two contiguous bank of 64 KB and 32 KB. All the available memory (Flash, RAM and ROM) can be accessed directly as a flat addressing space.
It is possible to erase the Flash memory of the SAM3X with the onboard erase button. This will remove the currently loaded sketch from the MCU. To erase, press and hold the Erase button for a few seconds while the board is powered.
Input and Output

Digital I/O: pins from 0 to 53Each of the 54 digital pins on the Due can be used as an input or output, using pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and digitalRead() functions. They operate at 3.3 volts. Each pin can provide (source) a current of 3 mA or 15 mA, depending on the pin, or receive (sink) a current of 6 mA or 9 mA, depending on the pin. They also have an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 100 KOhm. In addition, some pins have specialized functions:
Serial: 0 (RX) and 1 (TX)
Serial 1: 19 (RX) and 18 (TX)
Serial 2: 17 (RX) and 16 (TX)
Serial 3: 15 (RX) and 14 (TX) Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data (with 3.3 V level).
PWM: Pins 2 to 13 Provide 8-bit PWM output with the analogWrite() function. the resolution of the PWM can be changed with the analogWriteResolution() function.
SPI: SPI header (ICSP header on other Arduino boards) These pins support SPI communication using the SPI library. The SPI pins are broken out on the central 6-pin header, which is physically compatible with the Uno, Leonardo and Mega2560. The SPI header can be used only to communicate with other SPI devices, not for programming the SAM3X with the In-Circuit-Serial-Programming technique. The SPI of the Due has also advanced features that can be used with the Extended SPI methods for Due.
CAN: CANRX and CANTX These pins support the CAN communication protocol but are not not yet supported by Arduino APIs.
TWI 1: 20 (SDA) and 21 (SCL)
TWI 2: SDA1 and SCL1. Support TWI communication using the Wire library.
Analog Inputs: pins from A0 to A11 The Due has 12 analog inputs, each of which can provide 12 bits of resolution (i.e. 4096 different values). By default, the resolution of the readings is set at 10 bits, for compatibility with other Arduino boards. It is possible to change the resolution of the ADC withanalogReadResolution(). The Due’s analog inputs pins measure from ground to a maximum value of 3.3V. Applying more then 3.3V on the Due’s pins will damage the SAM3X chip. The analogReference() function is ignored on the Due.

The AREF pin is connected to the SAM3X analog reference pin through a resistor bridge. To use the AREF pin, resistorBR1 must be desoldered from the PCB.

DAC1 and DAC2 These pins provides true analog outputs with 12-bits resolution (4096 levels) with the analogWrite() function. These pins can be used to create an audio output using the Audio library.

Other pins on the board:

AREF Reference voltage for the analog inputs. Used with analogReference().
Reset Bring this line LOW to reset the microcontroller. Typically used to add a reset button to shields which block the one on the board.

Special pins on Taijiuino Due (Compared with Arduino):

Digital I/O: pins from103 to 109


To use those pins as other pins on Arduino, we need to make some change to Arduino IDE. Please refer to this instruction. After finish the modification, each of the 7 digital pins on the Due can be used as an input or output, using pinMode(), digitalWrite(), anddigitalRead() functions. They operate at 3.3 volts. Each pin can provide (source) a current of 3 mA or 15 mA, depending on the pin, or receive (sink) a current of 6 mA or 9 mA, depending on the pin. They also have an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 100 KOhm.


Ethernet Pins: pins from 92 to 102


Connect those pins to an Ethernet PHY module and Taijiuino could access networks. Those pins could also be used as an input or output, using pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and digitalRead() functions.

Communication
The Taijiuino Due Pro has a number of facilities for communicating with a computer, another Arduino or other microcontrollers, and different devices like phones, tablets, cameras and so on. The SAM3X provides one hardware UART and three hardware USARTs for TTL (3.3V) serial communication.
The programming pins are broken out for external program downloaders. Among those pins, the TXD and RXD pins are 5V TTL UART port, which are connect to TX0 and RX0 pins on Taijiuino Due through a 5V-3V3 TTL shifter.
The Native USB port is connected to the SAM3X. It allows for serial (CDC) communication over USB. This provides a serial connection to the Serial Monitor or other applications on your computer. It also enables the Due to emulate a USB mouse or keyboard to an attached computer. To use these features, see the Mouse and Keyboard library reference pages.
The Native USB port can also act as a USB host for connected peripherals such as mice, keyboards, and smartphones. To use these features, see the USBHost reference pages.
The Native USB port can also be used as a virtual serial port. Instead of using ""Serial"" object, use the ""SerialUSB"" object in the Arduino programming language, for example, SerialUSB.read()
The SAM3X also supports TWI and SPI communication. The Arduino software includes a Wire library to simplify use of the TWI bus; see the documentation for details. For SPI communication, use the SPI library.
Programming
The TAIJIUINO Due Pro can be programmed with the Arduino software (download). For details, see the reference and tutorials.
Uploading sketches to the SAM3X is different than the AVR microcontrollers found in other Arduino boards because the flash memory needs to be erased before being re-programmed. Upload to the chip is managed by ROM on theSAM3X, which is run only when the chip's flash memory is empty.
There are two ways to program the boards:

Native port: to use this port, select ""TAIJIUINO Due Pro (Native USB Port)"" as your board in the Arduino IDE. The Native USB port is connected directly to the SAM3X. Connect the Due's Native USB port (the one closest to the reset button) to your computer. Opening and closing the Native port at 1200bps triggers a 'soft erase' procedure: the flash memory is erased and the board is restarted with the bootloader. If the MCU crashed for some reason it is likely that the soft erase procedure won't work as this procedure happens entirely in software on the SAM3X. Opening and closing the native port at a different baudrate will not reset the SAM3X.

External Programming port: to use this port, you need external program downloader. Now the DUE PROG downloader is available. Insert downloader to Taijiuino Due and then connect it with PC with an USB cable. PC would recognize the device as ""Arduino Due"".For the first time, Windows OS requires driver. Please install in the following way:

Plug in your board and wait for Windows to begin it's driver installation process. After a few moments, the process will fail, despite its best efforts.
Click on the Start Menu, and open up the Control Panel.
While in the Control Panel, navigate to System and Security. Next, click on System. Once the System window is up, open the Device Manager.
Look under Ports (COM & LPT). You should see an open port named ""Arduino Due (COMxx)""
Right click on the ""Arduino Due (COMxx)"" port and choose the ""Update Driver Software"" option.
Next, choose the ""Browse my computer for Driver software"" option.
Finally, navigate to and select the Due's driver file, named ""Arduino Due Programming Port.inf"", located in the ""Drivers"" folder of the Arduino Software download (not the ""FTDI USB Drivers"" sub-directory).
Windows will finish up the driver installation from there.




In Arduino IDE, choose

Tools -> Board -> Arduino Due (Programming Port)
Tools -> Serial Port -> COMXX

Then program it and play.

USB Overcurrent Protection
The TAIJIUINO Due has a resettable polyfuse that protects your computer's USB ports from shorts and overcurrent. Although most computers provide their own internal protection, the fuse provides an extra layer of protection. If more than 500 mA is applied to the USB port, the fuse will automatically break the connection until the short or overload is removed.

To Sponsors
Why we fund here?
To let more users have a board like Arduino Due
Arduino Due is a great board, more powerful than its predecessors. However, due to expensive chips and components, the board is very expensive. We aim to have more people be able to afford this board. To reduce the cost, our hardware designer spent much time on resigning the schematic, while keeping the same or even better performance. For example, we replace the expensive LM2734Y with MP2359.
We all know that cost of production could be greatly reduced if the quantity rises up. We aim to produce more than 1000 pcs one time. We've reached agreement with the supplier and assembling factory. If we make more than 1000pcs, they could offer better price.
To rise fund for our future products
We are a group of technique guys. We love Arduino and make various modules for it. We have many ideas about new modules for Arduino Due. So far we designed several modules or boards for Arduino Due. However, due to weak marketing skills and limited finance, we could not populate our products to Arduino users. We got pressure to move on. We need fund for further products.
We have the following ideas for future products:
1. Taijiuino Ethernet = Taijiuino Due + PHY Ethernet Module. It is an real Arduino-Due-compatible board you could connect to network devices through a RJ45 cable.
2. Taijiuino Smart House: this is a board for developing intelligence housing system. The board could access wifi or Ethernet network. What's really amazing is that, you could design your controlling UI easily, without any requirement on network or phone programming. If you know how to program Arduino, you could use it. Most important, no matter your device is Phone, Android, windows or linux, it could work for all.
3. Network NFC device: this is a device reading / writing RFID card. It could also send/receive message from smart phone via NFC. The device could access Ethernet or wife network. It is really a useful device for Iota.
The timeline

All the designing work has been finished. The PCB board is ready for manufacturing.
Once we reached our fund goal, manufacturing work begins.
During the first 14 days (National Day Holiday will take 3 days off), the PCB manufacturer will produce and test the boards. At the same time, we will order and collect all the components.
During the following 14 days, the manufacturing plant will run the SMT assembling, DIP components soldering and deliver the boards to us. At the same time, we will collect materials for shipping.
During the following 7 days, we will test all the boards. Meanwhile, we will ship every days after testing.
The whole shipping process takes around 2 weeks. We will try our best to ship out all the boards within 7 days after testing process ends.
In case the interest we receive is higher than what we expected, we will update the output capacity. The time will not take longer.
Packing and Shipping
We will package each boad in an antistatic bad.
For order less than 5pcs, we will enclose the boards in an envelop.

The evelop had protecting bubble PE layer inside.

We will pack it well to prevent again shipping damage.
For order more than 5pcs, we will pack the board in a box.

We will ship your package through Singapore Post or HongKong Post. We could ship to all coutries. There will be tracking number for each pacakge.
Shipping and handing cost starts with 4USD for one board. For each extra board, 0.9USD would be added. If you want your package to be shipping through Express Shipping, please contact us.
For 100pcs orders, Express Shipping would be considered for most countries. There might be cutom duty. But in the following cases, we will ship it through Post Mail:

Your shipping address is in the remote ares of Exoress Shipping Service. DHL/UPS/FedEx will charge high extra fee for pacakges delivered to remote area.
Express Shipping Carrier doesn't supply the service in your country. Express Shipping companies in some countries such as Russia and Brazil, don't offer service shipping to individuals from here.
Express Shipping charges too much. We will contact you if it is in this case.

Important note: Express Shipping may involves custom duty. We are not responsible for any duty in your country. Please send us your VAT number if you have.

<h3>FAQ:</h3>
Q. Does it come with a microSD card?<span style=""background-color: initial;"">No, everyone has their own capacity needs and we thought it would be better for you to choose your own or use an existing one you have.</span>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Q. You mean the memory can be read on my phone? </p>
<p>Yes, if you have the iOS version, it can be read on an iPhone or iPad
and an android version, can be read on any android device.</p>
<p>Q. Will it work on my Android device?</p>
<p>/Binary requires Jelly Bean 4.1 or higher and
an enabled USB OTG system. However we have included a list below for your
reference.</p>
<p>Q. Why is there no
memory in the device? </p>
<p>We did not want to
restrict users from being such with a fixed memory capacity and wanted to
enable users the flexibility of switching the memory source wherever required.
(i.e. from DSLR camera to your mobile devices)</p>
<p>Q. Do I need an
app? </p>
<p>Android users do
not need an app for binary to work on the device. iOS users would need to
install a free app from the market place.</p>
<p>Q. Can I use the
device while using a casing on my phone? </p>
<p>Yes, we have given
a clearance of 3mm to for most slim profile phone cover. And, the device itself
is flexible to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Q. Is the data
cable flexible? </p>
<p>Yes, the data cable
is made to be flexible but retain its shape when not in use.</p>
<p>Q. Can I keep
switching microSD cards as I like, or will it only recognize specific cards? </p>
<p>There is no
specific</p>
<p>Q. Is the memory
component rigid? </p>
<p>Nope, the memory
device will be made out of an elastomer allowing flexibility</p>

FAQ:
Q. Does it come with a microSD card?No, everyone has their own capacity needs and we thought it would be better for you to choose your own or use an existing one you have.



Q. You mean the memory can be read on my phone? 
Yes, if you have the iOS version, it can be read on an iPhone or iPad
and an android version, can be read on any android device.
Q. Will it work on my Android device?
/Binary requires Jelly Bean 4.1 or higher and
an enabled USB OTG system. However we have included a list below for your
reference.
Q. Why is there no
memory in the device? 
We did not want to
restrict users from being such with a fixed memory capacity and wanted to
enable users the flexibility of switching the memory source wherever required.
(i.e. from DSLR camera to your mobile devices)
Q. Do I need an
app? 
Android users do
not need an app for binary to work on the device. iOS users would need to
install a free app from the market place.
Q. Can I use the
device while using a casing on my phone? 
Yes, we have given
a clearance of 3mm to for most slim profile phone cover. And, the device itself
is flexible to a certain extent.

<h3>Two Devices in One</h3>
<p>Do you carry around both a Laptop and Smartphone?  If you’re like us, you use and maintain both.  But do they really need to remain separate devices?  What if you could combine them into one?  Perhaps you've probably been keeping up with rumors about the Microsoft Surface phone.  Rumored as a real PC that also doubles as a phone, not a Windows ""<i>Mobile</i>"" version that is essentially an orphaned OS running on ARM that can't run your PC's "".exe"" programs.  ARM based Windows 10 is just not Windows 10 in our opinion.   </p>
<p>Introducing Trinity, the first smartphone to combine the two architectures into one.  Its LCD can switch views between Android and Windows 10.  Keep enjoying those Android apps on a native ARM/Android based system.   And run your Windows programs native on an Intel Braswell processor just like you would on your laptop or desktop PC.  Only now its in your hand like never before.  </p>
<p>Trinity is a real x86 based PC in your hand that runs anything your laptop or desktop PC runs <u><i>AND</i></u><i> </i>makes phone calls.  While we we're at, we decided to keep Android and all those great apps you love.  Why try to recreate an echo system that is already there!  Nothing like this is available today.  So, my son Eric and I have ventured to build it ourselves.  Trinity is the type of phone we really want, and hopefully you too!  This product idea is probably not going fill the vision that the big manufacturer's have for you.  But it's exactly the type of phone we'd like to have.  Help us get something new off the ground and bring a fresh perspective to the smartphone industry.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Why two processors?</h3>
<p>Emulating one Operating System over another eats up processor utilization and drains your battery quickly even for mundane tasks.  So, we kept them separate and allow them to run natively and independently on their own CPU, the one they were originally coded for.  This is far more power efficient and preserves processor bandwidth for doing real tasks, not running patchwork software that's eating up your CPU utilization in the background.  Performance is far better this way for both systems and improves battery life when only one system is needed.</p>

<h3>Monitor Output Capability</h3>
<p>View either Windows 10 or Android on Trinity's 1280x720 touch LCD or switch to HDMI. The HDMI ports can really help you get work done.  Check out the extended monitor setup below.  Add a USB keyboard/mouse with its onboard WiFi/BT/4G LTE connection options and you're all set to go.</p>

<p>One of the unique HDMI output options we’re working on with the Windows/Android HDMI port is Picture in Picture view (PIP). Which ever system is “full screen”, the second can window in/out.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>So Why Call it Trinity?</h3>
<p>Our 1st Generation Prototype was called ""<i>Nitro Duo</i>"" meaning ""<strong>Two</strong>"" (Windows/Android), but there was more to it then that.  We're talking about two separate systems sharing things like display, peripherals, data ports, sensors, etc.  To bind them together required something that would help them cooperate.  Nitro Duo utilized a Xilinx FPGA to tie everything together.  The FPGA causes the two operating systems to share without really knowing they're sharing.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As we worked out the logic inside the Xilinx, its capability and authority grew until it literally became a ""<strong>third processor</strong>"" or master controller of the entire system.  So we renamed it ""<strong>Trinity</strong>"" denoting its <i><strong>third </strong></i>brain.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Engineering Trinity</h3>
<p>Engineering electronic devices like PCs and Smartphones is no trivial task.  Getting them to merge and share their resources was even more difficult.  Operating Systems are usually masters of their domain and don't share.  So, getting two masters to cooperate made the hardware design quite complex.  Trinity's hardware design operates like a third master controller, which has the potential to add a layer of security never before seen in a smartphone as well as some cool features like picture n picture views of Android and Windows together on the LCD or even a single HDMI monitor.  Its also why we have changed the name from Nitro <u><i>Duo</i></u> meaning ""<strong>two</strong>"" to <u><i>Trinity</i></u> denoting ""<strong>three</strong>"".</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491338187/q5kf7lqnl048vljs0kf9.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We wanted the industrial design of Trinity to be as unique as the product.  No glass rectangle ditto phone here.  We wanted a totally new look.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491340320/jkf3ubb5caigdwvkba3h.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Prototype Gen 1</h3>
<p>We've been working on Trinity since July of 2015.  Below are some pictures of the first generation prototype we called ""Nitro Duo"" demo'd at CES 2016.  We wanted to get some feedback on the idea from others who might find it interesting.  The CES unit could exercise some basic stuff, like boot and operate both its processors, one for Windows, the second for Android.  They do have touch panels, but the drivers were not yet operational.  The LCD could switch from one system to another in about the time it takes to draw a single frame, very fast.  The USB port would also switch demonstrating port handover from one system to the other.  The hardware design is very unique, unlike anything ever before seen in a smartphone.   After CES 2016, we spent another whole year working out the electronics design, scrubbing the bill of materials, and working on the connections we need to move quickly once it gets funded.  </p>

<h3>SL Interphase Founder</h3>
<p><strong>Shane Lewis, Founder and CEO/CTO</strong></p>
<p>I've been working in the Electrical Engineering field for over 20 years with R&amp;D experience on designing a wide range of electronics on everything from PCs to Guidance Computers.  I started <a href=""http://www.sl-interphase.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SL Interphase</a> to test new product ideas and to provide engineering services to other companies.   I've been designing various embedded devices under my own banner since 2010 and have worked up a good network of suppliers and business professionals to make Trinity happen.  Now we're looking to build our own product line.   See my profile on <a href=""http://linkedin.com/in/shane-lewis-0659731a"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Linkedin</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Manufacturer Ready to Go:</h3>
<p>We have a ISO9001/AS9100C Certified manufacturer, AZPinc right here in our area ready to go.  We've been in the business of designing and building devices of various kinds since 2010, so we already have a good network of connections for vendors, parts, and high quality manufacturing right here in the Mesa/Tempe/Chandler/Scottsdale area (East Valley) of Phoenix, Arizona.  Our office is in Chandler, Arizona right off Price Corridor which is quickly growing into a major tech hub for Arizona with companies like Intel, Paypal, and Orbital Sciences (now ATK) just down the street.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492273574/iibx3cmtaq5zexpptivh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Design Considerations:</h3>
<p>Trinity may undergo some cosmetic changes as we continue to firm up the industrial design for manufacturability.  The thickness is still in flux with 17.5mm being the goal, but could expand to 19mm as we finalize where some internal features end up.  Minor features may move or get some tweaks, vents may move and various things like that.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>
<p><strong>What is Trinity for?</strong></p>
<p>Trinity is for anyone who carries around both a laptop and Android smartphone and would like the convenience of combining them into one device.  Its the ultimate portable Windows 10 device anywhere with an easy ability to plug in a USB keyboard/mouse and HDMI monitor for times when you're at your desk.</p>
<p><strong>Can I put one system to sleep and just use the other?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can put one system to sleep and keep the other system awake for extended battery life.  The unit sensors will work with either system.  Though you'll need Android running to access the cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Do both systems have access to the front and rear cameras?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, no.  Only the Android/ARM system drives the cameras.  The two systems are connected via USB port to each other and so with some software it should be possible to feed camera images to the Windows side for things like streaming video.  Though this will require both systems to be booted up.  We'll be working on features like this as we go.</p>
<p><strong>How long does a battery last?</strong></p>
<p>Update (4/13/17)  We now have a 11.1v LiPo cell pack that raises the power capacity considerable enough to get 2 - 2.5hrs on both systems simultaneously and ~8hrs+ on Android alone.  This will greatly improve battery life over the 1 hour of continuous use (both systems, 4 hrs Android only) we were getting with the 7.4v pack on the Proto Gen 1 Units.</p>
<p><strong>Can either system access the other system's storage?</strong></p>
<p>You mean, can my Android system take advantage of that huge Windows 128GB SSD drive?  Absolutely, Android is connected to Windows via a USB port.  Simply boot them both and Windows should view the Android as a connected hardware device.  Drag and drop at your leisure.  The USB connection scenario here is Windows as the ""host"" and Android as the ""device"" similar to your smartphone plugged into your PC.</p>
<p><strong>There are two HDMI ports.  Can I display Android on one monitor and Windows on the other?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, one of the cool features we wanted for ourselves.  Push Android up to a monitor while Windows 10 is expanded to a second monitor.  The LCD can act as either a primary or extended ""2nd"" monitor for Windows.  Or, keep Android displayed on the LCD and use both HDMI ports to push Windows for a dual extended monitor setup.  This is an area where we are working on really cool features such as a ""Windowed"" view using one of the HDMI ports.   In this view, both Android and Windows are displayed together in a sort of ""picture-n-picture"" view while the other HDMI port is dedicated to Windows.  </p>
<p><strong>Does Trinity have active or passive cooling?</strong></p>
<p>Trinity does have a temperature controlled fan.  Strange for a phone, but due to its small size and crammed with two processors, it makes too much heat (when both CPUs are working) for passive cooling to work well enough.  So, Trinity does utilize a fan/blower for ventilation and thermal cooling similar to how your laptop works.  This means the unit is ""open-air"" similar to your laptop and not sealed, so don't go swimming with it.</p>

Do you carry around both a Laptop and Smartphone?  If you’re like us, you use and maintain both.  But do they really need to remain separate devices?  What if you could combine them into one?  Perhaps you've probably been keeping up with rumors about the Microsoft Surface phone.  Rumored as a real PC that also doubles as a phone, not a Windows ""Mobile"" version that is essentially an orphaned OS running on ARM that can't run your PC's "".exe"" programs.  ARM based Windows 10 is just not Windows 10 in our opinion.   
Introducing Trinity, the first smartphone to combine the two architectures into one.  Its LCD can switch views between Android and Windows 10.  Keep enjoying those Android apps on a native ARM/Android based system.   And run your Windows programs native on an Intel Braswell processor just like you would on your laptop or desktop PC.  Only now its in your hand like never before.  
Trinity is a real x86 based PC in your hand that runs anything your laptop or desktop PC runs AND makes phone calls.  While we we're at, we decided to keep Android and all those great apps you love.  Why try to recreate an echo system that is already there!  Nothing like this is available today.  So, my son Eric and I have ventured to build it ourselves.  Trinity is the type of phone we really want, and hopefully you too!  This product idea is probably not going fill the vision that the big manufacturer's have for you.  But it's exactly the type of phone we'd like to have.  Help us get something new off the ground and bring a fresh perspective to the smartphone industry.
 

 
Why two processors?
Emulating one Operating System over another eats up processor utilization and drains your battery quickly even for mundane tasks.  So, we kept them separate and allow them to run natively and independently on their own CPU, the one they were originally coded for.  This is far more power efficient and preserves processor bandwidth for doing real tasks, not running patchwork software that's eating up your CPU utilization in the background.  Performance is far better this way for both systems and improves battery life when only one system is needed.

Trinity, the All in One Smartphone PC

 
Monitor Output Capability
View either Windows 10 or Android on Trinity's 1280x720 touch LCD or switch to HDMI. The HDMI ports can really help you get work done.  Check out the extended monitor setup below.  Add a USB keyboard/mouse with its onboard WiFi/BT/4G LTE connection options and you're all set to go.

One of the unique HDMI output options we’re working on with the Windows/Android HDMI port is Picture in Picture view (PIP). Which ever system is “full screen”, the second can window in/out.

 
So Why Call it Trinity?
Our 1st Generation Prototype was called ""Nitro Duo"" meaning ""Two"" (Windows/Android), but there was more to it then that.  We're talking about two separate systems sharing things like display, peripherals, data ports, sensors, etc.  To bind them together required something that would help them cooperate.  Nitro Duo utilized a Xilinx FPGA to tie everything together.  The FPGA causes the two operating systems to share without really knowing they're sharing.  
 
As we worked out the logic inside the Xilinx, its capability and authority grew until it literally became a ""third processor"" or master controller of the entire system.  So we renamed it ""Trinity"" denoting its third brain.  
 
Engineering Trinity
Engineering electronic devices like PCs and Smartphones is no trivial task.  Getting them to merge and share their resources was even more difficult.  Operating Systems are usually masters of their domain and don't share.  So, getting two masters to cooperate made the hardware design quite complex.  Trinity's hardware design operates like a third master controller, which has the potential to add a layer of security never before seen in a smartphone as well as some cool features like picture n picture views of Android and Windows together on the LCD or even a single HDMI monitor.  Its also why we have changed the name from Nitro Duo meaning ""two"" to Trinity denoting ""three"".

We wanted the industrial design of Trinity to be as unique as the product.  No glass rectangle ditto phone here.  We wanted a totally new look.

 
Prototype Gen 1
We've been working on Trinity since July of 2015.  Below are some pictures of the first generation prototype we called ""Nitro Duo"" demo'd at CES 2016.  We wanted to get some feedback on the idea from others who might find it interesting.  The CES unit could exercise some basic stuff, like boot and operate both its processors, one for Windows, the second for Android.  They do have touch panels, but the drivers were not yet operational.  The LCD could switch from one system to another in about the time it takes to draw a single frame, very fast.  The USB port would also switch demonstrating port handover from one system to the other.  The hardware design is very unique, unlike anything ever before seen in a smartphone.   After CES 2016, we spent another whole year working out the electronics design, scrubbing the bill of materials, and working on the connections we need to move quickly once it gets funded.  



 


 

SL Interphase Founder
Shane Lewis, Founder and CEO/CTO
I've been working in the Electrical Engineering field for over 20 years with R&D experience on designing a wide range of electronics on everything from PCs to Guidance Computers.  I started SL Interphase to test new product ideas and to provide engineering services to other companies.   I've been designing various embedded devices under my own banner since 2010 and have worked up a good network of suppliers and business professionals to make Trinity happen.  Now we're looking to build our own product line.   See my profile on Linkedin
 
Manufacturer Ready to Go:
We have a ISO9001/AS9100C Certified manufacturer, AZPinc right here in our area ready to go.  We've been in the business of designing and building devices of various kinds since 2010, so we already have a good network of connections for vendors, parts, and high quality manufacturing right here in the Mesa/Tempe/Chandler/Scottsdale area (East Valley) of Phoenix, Arizona.  Our office is in Chandler, Arizona right off Price Corridor which is quickly growing into a major tech hub for Arizona with companies like Intel, Paypal, and Orbital Sciences (now ATK) just down the street.

 
Design Considerations:
Trinity may undergo some cosmetic changes as we continue to firm up the industrial design for manufacturability.  The thickness is still in flux with 17.5mm being the goal, but could expand to 19mm as we finalize where some internal features end up.  Minor features may move or get some tweaks, vents may move and various things like that.
 
Frequently Asked Questions:
What is Trinity for?
Trinity is for anyone who carries around both a laptop and Android smartphone and would like the convenience of combining them into one device.  Its the ultimate portable Windows 10 device anywhere with an easy ability to plug in a USB keyboard/mouse and HDMI monitor for times when you're at your desk.
Can I put one system to sleep and just use the other?
Yes, you can put one system to sleep and keep the other system awake for extended battery life.  The unit sensors will work with either system.  Though you'll need Android running to access the cameras.
Do both systems have access to the front and rear cameras?
Currently, no.  Only the Android/ARM system drives the cameras.  The two systems are connected via USB port to each other and so with some software it should be possible to feed camera images to the Windows side for things like streaming video.  Though this will require both systems to be booted up.  We'll be working on features like this as we go.
How long does a battery last?
Update (4/13/17)  We now have a 11.1v LiPo cell pack that raises the power capacity considerable enough to get 2 - 2.5hrs on both systems simultaneously and ~8hrs+ on Android alone.  This will greatly improve battery life over the 1 hour of continuous use (both systems, 4 hrs Android only) we were getting with the 7.4v pack on the Proto Gen 1 Units.
Can either system access the other system's storage?
You mean, can my Android system take advantage of that huge Windows 128GB SSD drive?  Absolutely, Android is connected to Windows via a USB port.  Simply boot them both and Windows should view the Android as a connected hardware device.  Drag and drop at your leisure.  The USB connection scenario here is Windows as the ""host"" and Android as the ""device"" similar to your smartphone plugged into your PC.
There are two HDMI ports.  Can I display Android on one monitor and Windows on the other?
Yes, one of the cool features we wanted for ourselves.  Push Android up to a monitor while Windows 10 is expanded to a second monitor.  The LCD can act as either a primary or extended ""2nd"" monitor for Windows.  Or, keep Android displayed on the LCD and use both HDMI ports to push Windows for a dual extended monitor setup.  This is an area where we are working on really cool features such as a ""Windowed"" view using one of the HDMI ports.   In this view, both Android and Windows are displayed together in a sort of ""picture-n-picture"" view while the other HDMI port is dedicated to Windows.  
Does Trinity have active or passive cooling?
Trinity does have a temperature controlled fan.  Strange for a phone, but due to its small size and crammed with two processors, it makes too much heat (when both CPUs are working) for passive cooling to work well enough.  So, Trinity does utilize a fan/blower for ventilation and thermal cooling similar to how your laptop works.  This means the unit is ""open-air"" similar to your laptop and not sealed, so don't go swimming with it.
Will Trinity work in my country?
Trinity uses a pre-certified modem for use worldwide for both CDMA/GSM networks.  There may be additional requirements depending on your country and carrier.  We'll be working through these as we move the project along.
 

Risks & Challenges
As with any hardware project there are a number of risks.  Suppliers being one them.  However, we have been building prototypes of different flavors, capabilities, and components since July of 2015.  We're comfortable with our current bill of materials and suppliers that this risk has been greatly reduced.  However, there are still a few outstanding risks.

Trinity has not yet gone through the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) in order to include necessary features like Googleplay and Gmail to its Android OS.  We hope to have our second gen prototype enter that testing this summer.  It is our desire Trinity ship with Googleplay installed.  This could impact the current design in order to ensure this happens.
Classifying Trinity as a ""smartphone"" rather than a computer system with a 4G LTE ""modem"" requires certain relationships and partnerships to be in place.  We are working on this now.  We do have a channel for the approved hardware on both GSM/CDMA networks, though in some instances a direct relationship may still be required for clasificiation as a ""phone"" on certain carriers.
As we continue to refine the design, some specs could change including the processors.  However, the change would be for equal or greater performance than what was is listed above.

 
Other Ways You Can Help

We design hardware for a living, so much of the hardware design is covered.  However, there is still quite a bit of software engineering left to do, such as device drivers, machine specific applications, power/battery management, and tooling.  These costs are referred to as ""Non-Recurring-Engineering"" costs.  Most of the unit cost for a unit perk goes directly to component suppliers, assembly costs and not much else.  Please consider also contributing to the NRE perk as this goes directly to those NRE costs not associated with procurement of components.
