Considerable in-kind to instill confidence in the Arts Council was included in the financial breakdown of the bid but it's clear, applying for funding is becoming more difficult. Unfortunately, the bid was unsuccessful they: ""preferred another project"".

<p>In a contra dance, every person changes partners and
perspectives as they go through the patterns and music of the dance, like a
kaleidoscope that changes every time you turn it. But in the end, you always
end up ‘home with your own’. </p>
<p>So that’s the story of <i>Contra
Dance</i>: our lives change, time bends us, our hearts break, our towns fill up
with people we don’t recognize. Sometimes we get lost. Sometimes we lose hope.
But there’s a pattern to the dance, and if we’re lucky, it always brings us
home.</p>
<p>I’ve been a published writer and a working actor for over 40
years, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned in that time, it’s that if you
want to do the work you want... and work with your friends... you often have to
create your own. So In 1998 I founded <i>Advice
To The Players</i>, an educational Shakespeare company that’s still going
strong, and has given a whole lot of actors a whole lot of good work.</p>
<p>And now, there’s <i>Contra
Dance</i>. </p>
<p>I believe women need a larger voice in theatre, both as writers
and as actors. I believe talented older actors need more of a voice in theatre,
and more good roles to chew on. So <i>Contra
Dance </i>has 6 ornery characters over the age of 55, 4 of them smart, tough,
funny women. </p>
<p><i>Contra

now... generally act like younger people. Only with wrinkles.</p>
<p><i>Contra Dance </i>has been
nearly ten years in the making. It’s been workshopped, rewritten, read out
loud, rewritten some more, read again, and tweaked. In April its first public staged reading at New Hampshire Theatre Project’s Intelligent
Theatre Festival in Portsmouth, New Hampshire was a big success. Here’s what Genevieve Aichele,
Director of NHTP, says about <i>Contra Dance</i>:</p>
<p><i>“What really impressed me about the script is that it
creates character, relationship and atmosphere through witty, authentic and
intelligent dialogue.  It's the kind of play that doesn't get written much
anymore - no magic realism, no special effects, no cutaway scenes that belong
in a film screenplay - just plain old-fashioned excellent dialogue.  I
also like the focus on older women and men characters who are so often ignored
in contemporary work.”</i></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Contra Dance</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> is ready to roll! </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$10,000 won’t be all the money we need

The play is about the historic people-powered movement that sprouted up from the westside Tucson barrios, in the 1960s and '70s. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508095273/efurdzczpsld8jnlceww.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></h3><p>For decades, the City of Tucson thoroughly neglected its westside, Mexican American barrios. Taxpaying residents on the westside had to deal with unpaved streets and sidewalks, very few street lights, and a lack of basic services and facilities, including recreational spaces for children. Barrio children had to play in the street and empty lots or were forced to go to other neighborhoods to swim or play in a park.</p><p>In 1967, politicians campaigning in the barrios promised to build a park and neighborhood center on the west side if they won. After the newly-elected Mayor and Council reneged on their promise, barrio residents, propelled by the energy of the Chicano Movement, organized the El Rio Coalition to stand up for the barrios and demand that the City keep its promise. The “El Rio for the People” movement revolved around the El Rio Golf Course, a former members-only country club, which the City had bought and converted to a municipal golf course. Located between barrios Hollywood and El Rio/Sovaco, the lush, green golf course was a harsh contrast to the dusty streets and empty lots the barrio children had to play in.</p><p>The fight was not an easy one. Over many months, entire families marched and picketed in the summer heat and driving rain and confronted powerful elected officials. They faced racism, police brutality, and many other obstacles. Many El Rio Coalition members were arrested. Furthermore, they made many personal sacrifices for the greater cause. A number of El Rio Coalition members dropped out of college in order to focus on organizing full-time.</p><p>Eventually, the El Rio Coalition won an historic victory, securing a park and neighborhood center for the westside. The 1970 El Rio for the People movement was a defining moment in the political evolution of the westside. That historic movement started a domino effect across the city and inspired other neighborhoods to also stand up to City Hall and demand equality.</p><p>This play tells this powerful and important story!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508095672/vxtkmmsjjpmcdhb27uia.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>TELLING OUR STORIES</strong></h3><p>As a community, it is vital that we tell our own stories.</p><p>Art and storytelling have always been vital to our community.

inaugurando, nel marzo 2015,  un centro sperimentale di cinema e teatro di
animazione dotato di un <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.834626369949465.1073741865.556029321142506&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">laboratorio artistico-multimediale</a>, con sede in una
suggestiva torre di avvistamento medioevale, nel borgo termale di San Casciano
dei Bagni, tra gli incanti senesi.  Il centro HORROR VACUI <i>project</i> si configura
come un unicum su territorio nazionale, capace di far respirare a chi lo
frequenta la stessa aria delle grandi capitali europee, offrendo al pubblico le
proprie competenze e promuovendo l’arte e i media come strumenti creativi,
educativi e di comunicazione.  HORROR VACUI <i>project </i>è inoltre ideatore e capofila del
progetto di rete <i><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/CoppeliaTheatreMarionette/photos/a.726854137393356.1073741833.556029321142506/814692105276225/?type=3&amp;theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Araneum Artis</a></i>, una ragnatela di centri specializzati in arti sceniche in stretto
dialogo tra loro; un sistema proteiforme di residenze artistiche e cantieri
teatrali che offrono la loro professionalità su territorio nazionale grazie a
una rete di centri che si estende dalla Toscana alla Sardegna, dal Lazio
alla Campania, rivolti all’alta formazione professionale nei campi del teatro,
del cinema e dell’animazione.  Ma HORROR VACUI <i>project </i>è anche un sito culturale e una comunità
composta dagli artisti e da voi, un pubblico trasversale per età, passioni e
identità, un impegno che ci prendiamo ogni giorno con ognuno di voi, perché
crediamo profondamente che arte e cultura siano da annoverarsi tra i bisogni
primari dell’essere umano. Da oggi vogliamo intraprendere una nuova sfida,

Negli anni attori, musicisti, videomaker, scenografi, animatori hanno
studiato, lavorato, collaborato a fianco gli uni degli altri,  in
un’attività  che ha prodotto spettacoli capaci di confrontarsi con un
pubblico che non si aggrega attraverso gli eventi promossi nei social network,

nazionali: un pubblico giustamente esigente e non certo compiacente. COPPELIA THEATRE e HORROR VACUI <i>project</i>  ritengono, da sempre, che il valore principale della produzione
artistica  e dell’azione culturale che opera attraverso i linguaggi delle

THEATRE e HORROR VACUI project  
      Cari
Amici, sono passati quasi cinque anni da quando abbiamo avviato la nostra
attività: partite nel 2010 con la fondazione di una piccola compagnia di Teatro
di Animazione, la COPPELIA THEATRE, siamo giunte a realizzare un’impresa
culturale indipendente, la HORROR VACUI project,
inaugurando, nel marzo 2015,  un centro sperimentale di cinema e teatro di
animazione dotato di un laboratorio artistico-multimediale, con sede in una
suggestiva torre di avvistamento medioevale, nel borgo termale di San Casciano
dei Bagni, tra gli incanti senesi.  Il centro HORROR VACUI project si configura
come un unicum su territorio nazionale, capace di far respirare a chi lo
frequenta la stessa aria delle grandi capitali europee, offrendo al pubblico le
proprie competenze e promuovendo l’arte e i media come strumenti creativi,
educativi e di comunicazione.  HORROR VACUI project è inoltre ideatore e capofila del
progetto di rete Araneum Artis, una ragnatela di centri specializzati in arti sceniche in stretto
dialogo tra loro; un sistema proteiforme di residenze artistiche e cantieri
teatrali che offrono la loro professionalità su territorio nazionale grazie a
una rete di centri che si estende dalla Toscana alla Sardegna, dal Lazio
alla Campania, rivolti all’alta formazione professionale nei campi del teatro,
del cinema e dell’animazione.  Ma HORROR VACUI project è anche un sito culturale e una comunità
composta dagli artisti e da voi, un pubblico trasversale per età, passioni e
identità, un impegno che ci prendiamo ogni giorno con ognuno di voi, perché
crediamo profondamente che arte e cultura siano da annoverarsi tra i bisogni
primari dell’essere umano. Da oggi vogliamo intraprendere una nuova sfida,
la realizzazione della nuova produzione teatrale il Barbablù di Georg Trakl,
dramma espressionista per marionette e attori, nella versione di Marco Cavicchioli.  Per questo ti chiediamo: sostienici! Passa da semplice
spettatore a coproduttore!La
nostra campagna: BARBABLU', dramma surrealista per marionette e attoriNel Maggio 2016, COPPELIA THEATRE debutterà al Teatro Verdi di Milano in occasione dell'IF- Festival Internazionale del Teatro di Figura, con il suo Barbablù,
regia di Marco Cavicchioli, spettacolo multimediale di marionette e attori,
ispirato alla famosa fiaba trascritta da Charles Perrault nel
XVII secolo, nella versione del poeta austriaco Georg Trakl (1887- 1914),
una delle voci più drammatiche e vive della letteratura del Novecento.Nella logica della compagnia e nell’evidenza della credibilità maturata, sono coinvolti nel
progetto artisti italiani di fama internazionale, come Marco Cavicchioli attore
e regista, che nella sua ricca
carriera ha lavorato con nomi del calibro di Arnaldo Picchi, Jerzy Stuhr, Leo
De Berardonis, Raul Ruiz, Claudio Morganti, Cesare Ronconi,  Luciano Nattino, Gerald Thomas, Giampiero
Solari, Giorgio Gallione, Gabriele Lavia, Mario Martone, Andrea de Rosa,
Alessandro Gassmann. O ancora il talentuosissimo Stefano Bechini che si
occuperà della colonna sonora dello spettacolo, produttore, compositore e musicista, 
sound e multimedia designer, attivo in territori musicali che spaziano
dall’elettronica sperimentale alla classica. Ha lavorato con grandi artisti come: Paolo Fresu, Enrico Pieranunzi, Luis Enriquez Bacalov, Larry

tratta, le marionette da polso, tecnica unica al mondo, inventata
dall’ingegnere robotico siberiano Vladimir Zakharov, e di cui la COPPELIA THEATRE custodisce i segreti costruttivi. Una produzione teatrale multimediale che farà immergere il pubblico in un
mondo misterioso, gotico e notturno: musiche originali, videomapping e
animazioni proiettate su grande schermo, insieme ad altri sorprendenti trucchi

La nostra sfida                                                                                                               E’ ormai cosa più che nota la difficoltà in Italia di
lavorare facendo cultura, la pressoché totale mancanza di finanziamenti
pubblici non permette più una progettualità a lungo raggio sia per gli artisti
sia per i teatri. Il rischio costante è quello di dover rinunciare alla propria
ricerca artistica per la mancanza di fondi.
Gli strumenti per affrontarla
                     
                     
                     
                    Ciò che ha sempre caratterizzato l’attività di
COPPELIA THEATRE e HORROR VACUI project nei loro anni di attività all’interno del panorama
internazionale della cultura e dello spettacolo è la volontà di produrre progetti
e realizzare spettacoli, che coinvolgessero le migliori risorse artistiche del
teatro d’innovazione.
Negli anni attori, musicisti, videomaker, scenografi, animatori hanno
studiato, lavorato, collaborato a fianco gli uni degli altri,  in
un’attività  che ha prodotto spettacoli capaci di confrontarsi con un
pubblico che non si aggrega attraverso gli eventi promossi nei social network,
ma che agisce sulla base della curiosità, dell’informazione sui media
nazionali: un pubblico giustamente esigente e non certo compiacente. COPPELIA THEATRE e HORROR VACUI project  ritengono, da sempre, che il valore principale della produzione
artistica  e dell’azione culturale che opera attraverso i linguaggi delle
arti, e del teatro in particolare,  stia nella loro capacità di stimolare
e favorire la formazione e la crescita individuale e collettiva delle persone e
dei territori a cui quella produzione e quella azione sono rivolte.
Il piano d'azione        II nostro piano per
risolvere queste sfide ha nome Araneum Artis, un progetto di rete che
coinvolge cinque centri specializzati in arti sceniche in stretto dialogo tra
loro, per la costruzione di un circuito culturale alternativo a quello
istituzionale, partendo dal basso,  per la sopravvivenza di una ricerca
artistica che non si vuole confondere né con il mainstream né col semplice
intrattenimento.

<p>FERDINAND is a new
producing entity created by theatermaker Jack Tamburri, for projects that meet
a certain set of values. You can watch a video about FERDINAND here (<a href=""https://youtu.be/FWud9nIL4Mk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/FWud9nIL4Mk</a>)
but in brief, FERDINAND shows are original, site-specific, focused on the
actor, and humorous.</p>
<p><b>NOT FOR PROFIT</b> is the
first of FERDINAND's projects. <b>NOT FOR PROFIT</b> came out of a desire to make a
piece of theater for and about theater people -- why we love this work so
much, why no one else seems to love it as much as we do, why the institutions
that produce and distribute our work are so dysfunctional, and what we can do
about it. <b>NOT FOR PROFIT</b> is about everyone in the building, from the ushers to
the actors, from the marketers to the carpenters. It's a story about people
whose jobs require them to work with big wide-open hearts, and the trouble that
causes.</p>
<p><b>NOT FOR PROFIT</b> is being
built and performed in the lobby of the venerable Wilma Theater, a space with
great ghosts and weird carpet. It's being made by a director, a writer, and
three actors, all veterans of Philadelphia's fringe theater scene and all
brilliant comedians.</p>

<p>**You'll notice that the
majority of our budget is comprised of the space rental line and the artist fee
line. We have the opportunity not only to stage our performance in the lobby of
the venerable Wilma Theater, but also to hold every single rehearsal there.
What the Wilma is charging us is far less than the value of the space for the
number of hours we're working there -- thanks, Wilma! And the artist fees are

Hello everyone, we are <a href=""http://fronteirastheatrelab.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Fronteiras
Theatre Lab</span></a>, a
Scottish-based theatre company dedicated to producing and promoting
transcultural work. 'La Niña Barro' is our latest show, created in 2014 in
partnership with Spanish company A Poc A Poc Teatre i Musica. Since it opened
at the Edinburgh Fringe 2014, it has been performed at a number of venues and
festivals around Spain and we would like to take the piece further. We have
been invited to present it at <a href=""http://muestraperimetral.blogspot.com.br/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perimetral</a>, an international theatre showcase in
Uruguay in September 2015, alongside artists from Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina
and Mexico. The organisers provide accommodation, food, and insurance, we only
need the cash to pay for the return flights for our 2 performers and 1
technician. <br/>
<br/>
'La Niña Barro' is based on a collection of poems, so in order to help raise
the money for flights, our director Flav ran a <strong>24-hour poetry marathon </strong>on the <strong>10th-11th July</strong>, reciting 426 poems in 5 languages. This was streamed online and we had 126,000 visits to the link, but unfortunately, we did not raise enough. We are extending the campaign, now offering perks (if you have already collaborated, you will receive a gift accordingly, don't worry). Please sponsor us and help spread the word. </p>

um grupo de teatro sediado na Escócia dedicado a produzir e promover trabalhos
transculturais. 'La Niña Barro' é nosso trabalho mais recente, criado em 2014
em parceria com o grupo espanhol A Poc A Poc Teatre i Musica. Desde sua estreia
no Edinburgh Fringe 2014, a peça foi apresentada em diversos locais e festivais
da Espanha, mas queremos levá-la ainda mais longe. Fomos convidadas a
apresentá-la na mostra internacional <a href=""http://muestraperimetral.blogspot.com.br/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perimetral</a>, no Uruguai, em setembro de
2015, juntamente com artistas do Uruguai, Brasil, Argentina e México. A
organização fornece alojamento, alimentação e seguro, só precisamos do valor
para comprar as passagens de avião para nossas 2 atrizes e 1 técnica.

<p>'La Niña Barro' foi inspirada numa coleção de poemas, então para
ajudar a arrecadar fundos para os voos, nossa diretora Flavia fez uma <b>maratona poética de 24 horas </b>nos dias<strong> 10 e 11 de julho</strong>, recitando 426 poemas em 5 idiomas. A maratona foi transmitida ao vivo online e tivemos 126.000 acessos, mas infelizmente, não conseguimos angariar fundos suficientes. Estamos estendendo a campanha, agora oferecendo brindes (se você já colaborou, não se preocupe, receberá um presente de acordo com a doação que fez).

Hello everyone, we are Fronteiras
Theatre Lab, a
Scottish-based theatre company dedicated to producing and promoting
transcultural work. 'La Niña Barro' is our latest show, created in 2014 in
partnership with Spanish company A Poc A Poc Teatre i Musica. Since it opened
at the Edinburgh Fringe 2014, it has been performed at a number of venues and
festivals around Spain and we would like to take the piece further. We have
been invited to present it at Perimetral, an international theatre showcase in
Uruguay in September 2015, alongside artists from Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina
and Mexico. The organisers provide accommodation, food, and insurance, we only
need the cash to pay for the return flights for our 2 performers and 1
technician. 

'La Niña Barro' is based on a collection of poems, so in order to help raise
the money for flights, our director Flav ran a 24-hour poetry marathon on the 10th-11th July, reciting 426 poems in 5 languages. This was streamed online and we had 126,000 visits to the link, but unfortunately, we did not raise enough. We are extending the campaign, now offering perks (if you have already collaborated, you will receive a gift accordingly, don't worry). Please sponsor us and help spread the word.

Olá amigxs, somos Fronteiras Theatre Lab,
um grupo de teatro sediado na Escócia dedicado a produzir e promover trabalhos
transculturais. 'La Niña Barro' é nosso trabalho mais recente, criado em 2014
em parceria com o grupo espanhol A Poc A Poc Teatre i Musica. Desde sua estreia
no Edinburgh Fringe 2014, a peça foi apresentada em diversos locais e festivais
da Espanha, mas queremos levá-la ainda mais longe. Fomos convidadas a
apresentá-la na mostra internacional Perimetral, no Uruguai, em setembro de
2015, juntamente com artistas do Uruguai, Brasil, Argentina e México. A
organização fornece alojamento, alimentação e seguro, só precisamos do valor
para comprar as passagens de avião para nossas 2 atrizes e 1 técnica.

'La Niña Barro' foi inspirada numa coleção de poemas, então para
ajudar a arrecadar fundos para os voos, nossa diretora Flavia fez uma maratona poética de 24 horas nos dias 10 e 11 de julho, recitando 426 poemas em 5 idiomas. A maratona foi transmitida ao vivo online e tivemos 126.000 acessos, mas infelizmente, não conseguimos angariar fundos suficientes. Estamos estendendo a campanha, agora oferecendo brindes (se você já colaborou, não se preocupe, receberá um presente de acordo com a doação que fez). Patrocine a gente e nos ajude a divulgar a campanha!

<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><strong>Welcome to the Festival of European Anglophone Theatrical Societies (FEATS)</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><strong>June 2-5, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p>FEST (Frankfurt English Speaking Theatre / <a href=""http://www.festfrankfurt.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.festfrankfurt.org</a>) is celebrating 40 years in 2017 and  theatre is our passion! We are specially proud to host FEATS for the fourth time since 1991. The Lord Mayor of Frankfurt, Peter Feldmann, is honoured to sponsor FEATS on behalf of his home city. </p>
<h3><strong>And what exactly is FEATS?</strong></h3>
<p>FEATS was started in 1976 to bring together English-speaking theatre groups across continental Europe in a festival format. The festival takes place every year in a different city and attracts hundreds of participants and visitors. No one is paid to take part in the festival; everyone covers their own expenses. But it still costs quite a bit to put on the festival - and that's where you come in...</p>
<h3><strong>Are there Awards? </strong></h3>
<p>Yes! FEATS is the largest and recognised as the best theatre festival among English-language theatre groups in Europe. A professional adjudicator reviews each production and awards prizes for best play, best actor, best stage management, etc.</p>
<p>We also have a fringe programme that includes short plays and workshops. A great opportunity for those groups who didn’t make it into the main festival.</p>
<h3><strong>Where and when does it take place?</strong></h3>
<p>FEATS festival will be at Frankfurt's English Theatre, in the heart of the city (<a href=""http://www.english-theatre.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.english-theatre.de</a>), from 2-5 June, 2017.</p>
<p>We expect about 250 participants here in Frankfurt to give their best. 4 evenings with a total of 12 one-act plays await you, from well-known classics to world premieres of original scripts. We hope for an audience of around 1000 over the festival.</p>

Newman</strong>,<strong> </strong> starring <strong>Zac Thomas</strong> &amp;<strong> Marie</strong> <strong>Rose Fahlgren</strong>,  at <strong>The Sacred Fools Theatre</strong>, Hollywood.  July 2017.  </p>
<p>Website: <u><strong>AnyNightAustin.com</strong></u></p>
<p>Our journey with <strong>Any Night</strong> by Daniel Arnold &amp; Medina Hahn, began over two years ago as a part of Austin's seminal <i>FronteraFest</i> Fringe Festival.  When the festival lost the performance space at the last minute - <i>exactly 27 hours before our opening night </i>- our <strong>Any Night</strong> Team -<i> in one day </i>-  pulled together to mount our production in an historic barn (after all, Austin <i>is </i>in Texas, y'all...).  We performed at the Barn to sold out audiences.  Thanks to the support and enthusiasm of our FronteraFest audience at the Barn, we were able to mount the official Austin Premiere in September 2016 at the City Theatre.  </p>
<p>We were thrilled to have our playwrights, Daniel &amp; Medina, come down to Austin (from Canada!) to attend the performance and hold a special playwright talk-back event.</p>
<p>The positive response to <strong>Any Night</strong> during our Austin premiere was breathtaking from the engagement of the audience and the discussion sparked during the  post-show talkbacks - we knew we had to share Any Night with a broader audience.</p>
<h3>ANY NIGHT Today...</h3>
<p>The world has changed dramatically in the two years since we first began our work on <strong>Any Night.  </strong>The themes presented &amp; questions posed by the play - <i>Trust, Truth, Privacy, Psychological Manipulation &amp; Violence against Women </i>- have all taken on a chillingly deeper, more urgent resonance.  Never have we needed the Arts more than now as a way to shed light on some of these darker aspects of our current society and culture. </p>

<h4><b>History of the Project</b></h4>
<div>
<p><span>Writer/performer Lyndsay Kane began working on this project in 2001 as part of a Graduate Course when 9-11 happened.  She began to recognize an eerie similarity to the events, and more particularly the religious rhetoric unfolding in the world, with those in Cassandra’s story.  Kane realized the myth still had potent lessons to teach. Kane felt compelled to give a voice to the protestors of war and submitted the production to the LA Edge Fest, unfortunately life and health events stepped in and brought the production to a halt.  Shortly after she and her fiance moved back home to the Midwest, where one of her first auditions in Chicago was for Kate Hendrickson (director of Cass/Andra).  After working together, Kane recognized Hendrickson’s talent for directing and cultivating new work.  Coupled with a deep friendship and artistic like-mindedness, Kane decided she had found the perfect director to help see Cass/Andra to fruition.  Together they enlisted the brilliant and dedicated minds of Deirdre Connelly and Taylor Bibat to help produce the show. These four women, who make up Heretic Productions, brought together members of the original design team along with some of the greatest designers Chicago has to offer.</span></p>

Sync Book Press held our first major Sync Summit in Olympia,
Washington. The event was a great success and featured talks and
presentations from Sync Book authors, broadcasters and sync
filmmakers, including a Radio8Ball Show with Mark Hosler of
Negativland, a walking tour of The Kabbalistic Tree of Olympia, a
Skype appearance from Rodney Ascher (Room 237), and a constant flow
of sync that is documented at thesyncbook.com/oly2014.Now in January of 2016 Sync Book Press is releasing all the footage from the 2014 event AND launching a new season of Sync activities that includes an exclusive Spring Sync event in Boise, Idaho in March and the
next Oly Sync Summit in August.
THIS IS A 3-PHASE PROJECT

The Boise Spring Sync (March
23rd-27th)  will
be an opportunity to spend an intimate weekend with fellow explorers
of synchronicity in a relaxed environment during Boise's
Treefort Music Festival. Sort of like  our version of 'The Real World, Boise edition.' We are renting a house in downtown Boise with plans for some guerrilla 
sync experiments at the Treefort Music Fest as well as exploring what kind of media and artwork we can create together over the four nights and five days of our retreat.The Olympia Sync Summit (August
18th-21st) will
once again feature a Radio8Ball Show, as well as a full moon Tree
Walk. In lieu of traditional presentations, the weekend will focus on
screenings of new material and moderated discussions of a wide range
of Sync topics. We have some ideas about topics we'd like to cover
and we are also very interested in what's on the mind of our
participants so please include your suggestion with your
contributions.The scope of the events we plan will be dependent
upon the response to this campaign so if you want it to be something
special we need you to get your tickets early and spread the word to
your fellow sync enthusiasts.A Sync Summit Documentary is just begging to be made. We captured some of the
most incredible minds in some of the most sync saturated moments. Our camera crews were everywhere (as the videos we've released so far, as well as all the remaining

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>*Check out our fun perks! We will also be doing a grand opening party with raffles if anyone has something they'd like to donate for one of our raffle baskets:)</p>
<p>*It took us 2 years  and over $25,000 to complete our first location. Luckily this location already has hardwood floors, which saves us a fortune! So we are able to build out the new location for only $6,000. We couldn't do it without you!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>*We have helped countless students reach their weight loss goals. We even do competitions!</p>
<p>*Everyone needs to make time for themselves. If the best hour of your day wasn't at The Studio, then you've had a really good day:)</p>
<p>*Bringing people together is by far the best part about what we do! We bring together everyone from neighbors to sisters to friends to married couples. We've all met a new best friend at The Studio:)</p>

We are able to do it for only $6,000! Anything else we need can be upgraded over time. Our other location took 2 years and almost $25,000 to complete. If this campaign nets $10,000 we will offer our first month of group classes free to everyone! If it reaches $15,000 we will offer another month of classes for FREE! Who doesn't love free classes? So please share this and help bring the most exciting new store into Tri County Mall! Please help us continue to inspire and motivate through dance!
 
Hey everybody!
My name is Greg Insco. Two years ago a team of excited instructors opened a dance studio through community involvement inside Northgate Mall. Because of the impact we had on our community, our friends at Tri County Mall encouraged us to grow and open a second location. We are thrilled to do it again! Opening these dance studios has been the funnest accident we've ever had. We love bringing people together! So stop by, WE PROMISE YOU'LL HAVE FUN! 
 
Who are we?
 
Owner/Instructor: Greg Insco

Greg has walked across America, officiated countless weddings, is an elected Trustee in Colerain Township, and done over 40 shows/movies. He even performed on dancing with the stars live tour, twice. If you only remember three words he says, remember this: LIVE YOUR DREAMS!
 

Owner/Instructor: Jeff Anderson
Jeff is a 5th grade teacher and has taught for 23 years. He has also taught line dancing for 20 years. When he's not teaching he's DJ'ing weddings or looking for Bigfoot!
 
Phoenix Rising Ballroom Owner and Instructor: Lenny & Maria teach all types of dance!
 
We are always looking for new instructors. Here are some great ones that teach at our other location:  Jeff W., Tim, Demitrious, Kathryn, Lori, Sandy, Matthew, Carolyn, Erin, and Jeannie.
 
We have the best front desk anyone could ask for. Vanessa, Lori, Jeannie, Mindy, Leslie, Keisha, and Miranda are all beyond amazing.
 
We are always interested in adding classes/instructors. Send ideas to: thereverendgreg@gmail.com

 

What We Need & What You Get
*Check out our fun perks! We will also be doing a grand opening party with raffles if anyone has something they'd like to donate for one of our raffle baskets:)
*It took us 2 years  and over $25,000 to complete our first location. Luckily this location already has hardwood floors, which saves us a fortune! So we are able to build out the new location for only $6,000. We couldn't do it without you!
*If we don't reach our entire goal we are still opening. It will just take a lot longer to get everything picture perfect.

The Impact
*We have helped countless students reach their weight loss goals. We even do competitions!
*Everyone needs to make time for themselves. If the best hour of your day wasn't at The Studio, then you've had a really good day:)
*Bringing people together is by far the best part about what we do! We bring together everyone from neighbors to sisters to friends to married couples. We've all met a new best friend at The Studio:)
* We've never turned down a charity. We do at least one event/donation per month:) We always donate passes/raffles to any cause. If it's important to you, it's important to us!

Other Ways You Can Help
We realize times are tough for lots of great people but that doesn't mean you can't help:)
*Sharing this link is free:)
*We have a ton of flyers we need to pass out to all the local business's. 
*If you can help with any raffle baskets for our grand opening party that would be awesome!

We will showcase a story of resilience created by Alan Wallace, music composed by Goodshield Aguillar and Jack Kohler (On Native Ground), Musical Arrangement by Simon' Wilson, a script written by Jack Kohler, and support from Artists: Stan Padilla (Placer Arts), J Ross Parrelli (Universal Music Group Artist),  Auburn Hip Hop Congress, Beats Lyrics Leaders, and many other local artists and organizations.

</div><b>Who said What?</b><div>
<p><i>Thar's gold in them thar hills! </i>so went the cry of the prospectors from Sutter's Mill in the Gold Rush of 1848, but in <i>""Something Inside is Broken,"" </i>you learn that the gold predated the prospectors, and the Nisenan and their stories had been there for millennia. Now is our chance to honor the true treasures. Language is the essence of being human -- it tells us who we are, allows us to meet the sky, pours words into the river that has no banks -- voila! What Alan Wallace and the team are doing for the Nisenan is the very model of how a language can survive. </p>

Goals

We have the opportunity to teach an unheard perspective on California history,  and since this knowledge holds our faith and beliefs so deeply, we are asking for any and all support you can help with funding our program and ideas. Not only does it benefit all the individuals involved, whom will feel the direct healing from talking about such an epidemic, but it will also benefit everyone who gets to witness this musical performance and production. Our goal is to start by performing this production entitled ""Something Inside is Broken"" with our full cast at a local College and University, and ultimately spread this across the nation like a California Wildfire. 
Join us in celebrating, healing, and building a positive impact in the people and environment we call home.  Your donation will be a non-profit charitable donation to ‘On Native Ground’ whom administers the funding. All of 'On Native Ground's' staff are volunteers, so all of the funding goes towards the production.
For further questions contact:     Alan Wallace at alanwallace3@gmail.com / 530-852-2329 or Jack Kohler at jack@onnativeground.org / 707-592-9030
Who said What?
Thar's gold in them thar hills! so went the cry of the prospectors from Sutter's Mill in the Gold Rush of 1848, but in ""Something Inside is Broken,"" you learn that the gold predated the prospectors, and the Nisenan and their stories had been there for millennia. Now is our chance to honor the true treasures. Language is the essence of being human -- it tells us who we are, allows us to meet the sky, pours words into the river that has no banks -- voila! What Alan Wallace and the team are doing for the Nisenan is the very model of how a language can survive.

<p>We want YOU to be a part of the production. By donating to the project you will receive updates on casting the rest of the roles, pictures of the process and rehearsals and much more. </p>
<p>The Production will be presented at the Electric Lodge in Venice, CA opening this May 7th 2016 and this additional funding is to present the production in the means that it deserves!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE PLAY:</strong></p>
<p>Blood From A Stone tears at the gut with its wrenching story of dysfunction and destruction. A sadly relatable dark comedy that shows the most difficult trap to escape from may be our own family.</p>
<p>Blood From A Stone was originally produced by the New Group in New York City. The lead role was played by <b>Ethan Hawke</b> as he won an<strong> Obie Award </strong>for his performance receiving rave reviews. This Tour de Force production has not been seen since! Until Now!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joanne Baron saw a scene I performed from <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Blood From A Stone and told me it was so powerful I should really do the entire play. And so the journey began.. </span></p>We decided to seek out the playwright to obtain the rights to stage the West Coast premier of the production. With many up and downs, two years later we are at the home stretch and getting excited for the production and we would love for you to be apart of it. Join the excitement and come along for this ride by donating as little as $1.00! You will be included in all updates and exclusive behind the scene photos including casting, rehearsals, set-design and more. See first hand what goes into a production and where it all goes. </div><div><br/></div><div>

</div></div>","We are looking to finish funding for the West Coast Premier of the Obie Award winning play ""Blood From A Stone"".
We want YOU to be a part of the production. By donating to the project you will receive updates on casting the rest of the roles, pictures of the process and rehearsals and much more. 
The Production will be presented at the Electric Lodge in Venice, CA opening this May 7th 2016 and this additional funding is to present the production in the means that it deserves!

ABOUT THE PLAY:
Blood From A Stone tears at the gut with its wrenching story of dysfunction and destruction. A sadly relatable dark comedy that shows the most difficult trap to escape from may be our own family.
Blood From A Stone was originally produced by the New Group in New York City. The lead role was played by Ethan Hawke as he won an Obie Award for his performance receiving rave reviews. This Tour de Force production has not been seen since! Until Now!

Joanne Baron saw a scene I performed from Blood From A Stone and told me it was so powerful I should really do the entire play. And so the journey began.. We decided to seek out the playwright to obtain the rights to stage the West Coast premier of the production. With many up and downs, two years later we are at the home stretch and getting excited for the production and we would love for you to be apart of it. Join the excitement and come along for this ride by donating as little as $1.00! You will be included in all updates and exclusive behind the scene photos including casting, rehearsals, set-design and more. See first hand what goes into a production and where it all goes.

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527774434/oe1w1zcqm4t43qggm2hl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>WHO ARE YOU? </strong>Thanks for asking! My name is Elaine O' Dwyer. I am an Irish actress who trained at the Guildford School of Acting. I am currently living in London. I previously trained and worked as a primary school teacher in Ireland.</li>
<li>
<strong>WHEN DID YOU WRITE THE PLAY? </strong>Good question! Having read Maureen's autobiography last November (2017), I made the decision to write the play. She was too interesting and captivating a person to simply brush past. I spent the last six months researching Maureen's life, watching her films, observing her interviews and even meeting her close friends. I also managed to get my hands on her own personal vanity case which I will use in the show. </li>
<li>
<strong>WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN PLAY MAUREEN?</strong> I can relate to Maureen's character in many ways -her stubborn temperament, brashness, open-heartedness, naivety and fragility. Like Maureen, I took part in many performance competitions as a child and was part of a musical family. O' Hara and I would have got on well as children as we were both tom-boys.  I spent my childhood in wellingtons on the farm -not in pretty dresses! Maureen and I share the same outspoken nature; I think this boldness stems from our shared star-sign -we are both Leo the lion. I also happen to be a fiery redhead.</li>
<li>
<strong>WHO CAN RELATE TO THIS STORY?</strong> O’ Hara’s story is one that everyone can relate to and be inspired by. A dear friend of Maureen once said “She was more than an actress. She was a person. A real person”. She was a loving mother, boisterous daughter, affectionate sister, troubled wife, loyal friend and a wonderful leading lady. Her life was thrilling yet challenging, successful yet heart-breaking. She stood up for herself during a time when the casting couch was common and when studio bosses in Hollywood controlled their stars. She went through life with plenty knocks along the way but no matter how bad things got, she never lost hope and she never stopped fighting. Anyone who has ever felt like giving up will be invigorated by O’ Hara’s story.</li>
<li>
<strong>WHY DO YOU NEED ME? </strong>I need you to help support the costs of putting this remarkable story on stage. I want to tell Maureen’s story in the best way possible which means hiring a creative team and giving Maureen’s life on stage the legs it deserves. She was a woman of strength and beauty and I feel a sense of duty to honor that. In supporting this project, you will be giving this show the best chance it can get before it embarks on a national tour in 2019. I want to tell her story in an honest, respectful and theatrically compelling way. Your support will help me to bring the truth of this remarkable woman to the stage and to the world.</li>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>MACHA Theatre Co. is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing the LGBTQI community producing, writing, directing and performance opportunities within a creative environment that encourages building bridges to a mainstream audience to foster understanding between communities.</p>
<p>We are asking our LGBTQI community and allies to contribute towards our goal of creating new and impactful programming, and securing and renovating a new venue for MACHA Theatre to call home.</p>
<p>All perks receive ticket(s) to the upcoming production of <i>Frida: Stroke of Passion</i> in February 2020!</p>
<h3>Meet MACHA Theatre</h3>
<p>MACHA Theatre Co. was founded in 2000 by Artistic Producing Director Odalys Nanin because of the lack of Latina-LGBTQI stories in the theater community, the lack of leading roles for lesbians of color and a lack of real cultural inclusion or representation of the Latina lesbian experience in mainstream theater.  MACHA is an acronym Mujeres (Women) Advancing Culture, History, and Art.</p>
<p>For the past 19 years, MACHA has produced award winning, high quality, and exciting theater featuring lesbians of color in the title roles.  We’ve had a loyal following since the company’s inception, as well as critical acclaim for the interesting stories and great production value.  A nomadic theater company, producing two productions per year and one writing workshop, we’ve invited mentors like Maria Irene Fornes - nine time Obie Award winning playwright - and Professor Cherrie Moraga - Chicana activist - to work with us.</p>
<p>MACHA is the only professional theater company lead by a Latina lesbian in the United States.  With limited venues providing producing, writing, directing and performance opportunities, MACHA has been filling this role by offering cultural, equity and inclusion to both the LGBTQI community and women of color - both integral parts of the city of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Thanks in part to generous grants from the Astrea Foundation and the City of West Hollywood, along with wonderful volunteers, we have continued to produce original cutting edge plays and adaptations of classic plays like <i>Blood Wedding</i>.</p>
<p>Magic was created on stage and our houses were full.  In 2007, we were able to call the venue at 1107 N. Kings Rd. - then called the Globe Playhouse - our home.  After remodeling the venue - and a rename - MACHA Theatre - the doors opened on April 22, 2007 with two new plays, <i>Skin of Honey</i>, directed by Odalys Nanin, and <i>The Adventures of Lieutenant Nun</i>, directed by Ivonne Coll.</p>
<p>The next ten years saw MACHA Theatre flourishing, increasing the company’s reputation as a professional theatre company.  Celebrities including Al Pacino, Jeff Goldblum, Tom Hanks, Mel Gibson, Nia Vardalos, and Sophie B. Hawkins visited and produced at MACHA’s new home.</p>
<p>While seeing success in the new venue, in 2017 the landlord sold the entire corner - which included MACHA Theatre.  The new landlords - real estate investors - unfortunately doubled our rent. On December 27, 2017, we had to relinquish our venue and lost over $26,000.</p>
<p>Since that time, it took us more than year to be able to produce again and continue with our mission.  2019 has seen MACHA produce<i> Love Struck</i>, and in 2020 we are bringing back the critically acclaimed production of <i>Frida: Stroke of Passion</i>.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Since losing our performance space in 2017, it has been a constant struggle to be able to produce new programming and continue with our mission.  We would like to empower the community by creating, producing and telling impactful stories that touch so many.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I’m sure like me,  you’ve  been feeling helpless about the way our current administration has been treating immigrants and refugees, in particular the separation of children from their parents at the border.  When I saw a CNN report about a Jewish women helping to hide a Latina mom and her two daughters from ICE after her husband was suddenly deported, it immediately brought me to the play “The Diary of Anne Frank”.  Then I thought, what if I directed the play word-for-word, but cast everyone in the attic with LatinX actors.  So along with Producers Anne Kathryn Parma and Tracey Rooney and our genius casting director Julie Gale, we embarked on putting this big production together.  Little did we realize that our 50 seat show would cause such a world wide commotion. Once people saw that we were NOT changing the Nazis to ICE agents and that we were honoring the story of Anne Frank, just told through different eyes, the tide turned and we ended up with two successful runs in Fall 2018 and Jan/Feb 2019.  We’re now bringing the show back for 3 performances in Beverly Hills and 5 in Vancouver at the Chutzpah Festival!  But we can’t do it without the help of our friends and family.  With a cast of 10, the cost is just too prohibitive. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>With the financial help we receive, we'd be able to lower ticket prices to student groups. School groups have been a priority for us after learning that “The Diary of Anne Frank”is no longer required reading in California Public Schools. We would like to keep the show going around the United States, reaching out to communities and school groups for performances. Our goal is to spark discussion and change where we can. </p>
<p>With the donations received we would like to:</p>
<p>- Lower ticket prices for student groups and continue student outreach</p>
<p>- Continue Talk Backs after performances with Holocaust survivors </p>
<p>- Help offset travel costs of touring the show</p>
<p>- Fund performances for those who would otherwise be unable to financially attend</p>
<p>With a donation to our play, we offer many perks from free tickets to a signed “Star Trek: Discovery” picture from Wilson Cruz, who has recently joined our production team.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The production, with these actors, at this time, can and is provoking a much needed discussion on a vital topic.  For adults and especially for children, the issues our production addresses cannot continue to be ignored. We also have done multiple Talk Backs after performances with Holocaust Survivors to help draw the connections of past and present, and the similarities within them. We have already lost some of the survivors we have worked with, and it is becoming glaringly obvious that time is of the essence. We cannot keep waiting to talk about what has happened in our history, or what is happening currently in our country. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>          Hi, my name is Gian Kamal a college student at CSU Fullerton, a performer with CMTSJ since 2007, and a danced at CDC. I am a working choreographer and have been hosting safe ways for high school performers to perform during this pandemic. </p>
<p>           It was hard to see all these performer's shows get canceled due to the shutdown back in March, so I made it my mission to develop a way for them to continue their craft in the most safest way possible. This campaign is to keep our program running, not be a financial burden on our families, and continue to provide the arts to high schools students safely during the pandemic.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>          What your kindness will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>$0 to almost nothing costume fees for the performers</li>
<li>Better equipment for the performers/performance</li>
<li>Better thermometers, masks, and more onsite necessities. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>            With your help we can really provide a fundamental learning experience for high school students with no performance outlet during this time. Each donation makes it affordable and safer for each family involved. The heath of the families is our number one priority and with your help we can make our process even safer. Theater is an outlet we can always be apart of for life, and for these students it has been taken away. Help us make a difference in our community and support the arts during this troubling time. </p>

<p><strong>The Producer</strong></p>
<p>My name is Carlos F. Londono-Arango and I'm a producer, writer, director, actor, and meditation teacher. You may know for me for my film All Wars End which won several local South Florida film-making awards as well as a George Washington Certificate of Merit. My most recent acting credits include; the stage play <i>August Osage County</i> and the short film, <i>The Game</i> by award winning director David Jaure.</p>
<p><strong>The Writer/Director</strong></p>
<p>David Walton over the last eight years, has written and directed numerous faith-based dramas produced locally to great reviews. Recently, one of his works, When It Snows in Miami, was purchased and produced by 246 The Main, a community theater in Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>How the production got started...</strong></p>
<p>David and I met at a local workshop for actors and writers called the Actor's Sweatshop in Miami and noticed that we both gravitated towards material that not only delved into characters living through dark nights of the soul but pushed deeper through their journeys through that internal landscape on their way towards some form of redemption and illumination. </p>
<p>We saw in the Tilted Halo a chance to not only bring an important story to life but also to combine our efforts to help support social causes that mattered - in this case it was the story of people who are imprisoned and wrongfully convicted of crimes they didn't commit. In its inception this project has been meant to not just entertain but to raise awareness for the work of the Innocence Project, a non-profit dedicated to helping people wrongly convicted. </p>
<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>The Tilted Halo is in and of itself a morality tale, but one with a darker, grittier edge. Set in a Florida state prison in the mid-1980’s. It introduces the audience to Milo and Josh, two people of very different backgrounds. Both convicted of murder and both profess their innocence...but only one is. The weaving together of Milo and Josh’s stories creates a complex tapestry that is at times disturbing, yet ultimately delves into the possibility of redemption. </p>

<p>Here at the New York Shakespeare Company we are endeavoring to bring Shakespeare to the city of New York, in a way they've never seen before, whilst keeping the history and traditions alive.</p>
<p>Critically acclaimed and award nominated Artistic Director David Hywel Baynes, moved to New York almost 10 years ago and wants to share how he feels Shakespeare can change lives with some of the greatest stories ever put to paper. He has been studying Shakespeare for his entire adult life and has experienced the giggles of the comedies, the heartbreak of the tragedies and honor in the ultra violent history plays. </p>
<p>It's a different world from Shakespeare's era filled with plague, war, political unrest and the crowning of a new ruler, BUT the methods of performing his plays, successfully, haven't. In over 400 years, since these plays were written the most enjoyable and entertaining Shakespearean performances have been those that embrace the old ways, without adding superfluous elements for the sake of it. Using a combination of classical and modern techniques, David has discovered a fresh way of telling these stories and make them accessible to everyone again, because the people were who Shakespeare wrote for in the first place.</p>
<p>Shakespeare's writings have a power very few other writers have even come close to. A Power that make us look at ourselves and become better people. His plays are a celebration of the beautiful insanity that is the world and if there's one thing that this world needs right now, it's more celebration. If there's one thing Shakespeare's plays tell us is that we are essentially ALL just human beings, feeling human emotions, no matter where your from.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><i><strong>THE AWKWARD BIT...</strong></i></h3>
<p>Very much like Shakespeare on his arrival in London from Stratford, we need help with money to get us started, even modestly, we need your help.</p>
<p>In the interest of keeping things to the bare essentials at first, we are looking to raise $15,000 in order to tell the gruesome story of Macbeth in the summer of 2018. We put a great deal of faith in the strength of the stories Shakespeare wrote without the trappings of lavish setting and costume, which will always come second to the words he penned down.</p>
<p>The majority of the budget is dedicated to location, both for performance and rehearsal, which takes up over a third of the budget alone, but New York City is the city and a Midtown location is essential to reach the most diverse and cosmopolitan audience.</p>
<p>In our years in the business we have experienced how hard it is for actors to survive whilst looking to build a career in entertainment. A tough thing to do at any stretch. Actors sacrifice a great deal of their time to try and be as prepared and as good for the paying audience as they can be, they deserve something for their troubles.</p>
<p>There's been a trend over the last 20 years of actors getting paid less and less but asked to work harder and harder, to now when it's incredibly rare for actors to receive anything for their troubles and hard work. We hope to compensate all artists, because an artist that feels appreciated is going to give their best performance. See? It's in everyone's interest. </p>
<p>The Ensemble, including cast and crew, will receive a stipend of $250 for their time and effort. Gratitude is a lost virtue. We would like to help bring it back. Until we are more settled and established, we will offer what we can, but always offer something.</p>
<p>In performing a play like Macbeth, there are simply going to be some essential props and set dressing that are necessary when attempting such a visual play. Shakespeare's plays lend themselves to the economically sound and thriftily inclined, but there are just some things needed to do one of the greatest plays of all time justice. Just remember ""Blood will have blood"", and laundry is a wonderful thing when looking to get those pesky blood stains out. We will need cleaning materials. Lots of cleaning materials.</p>
<p>Another expenditure that is unavoidable when trying to build a name and brand is of course Marketing. We are confident that our productions will speak for themselves as the years go by, but that's no good when no-one is aware we or the production exists. Advertising and marketing is already well on it's way, with the poster designed and ready to share with the public, and tickets on sale now. </p>
<p>We need people to see the show and as such we have put a modest amount toward our marketing strategy, aiming to utilize post boosting on social media which will directly target specific audiences who have already created connections with already established companies here in NYC. </p>
<p>Any money helps but if we fail to reach our goal, we'll put the money we do raise, toward a postponed production of Macbeth. This play has been too long in the making to not be shown. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>What We Can Achieve</i></h3>
<p>The effects of a well presented Shakespeare production can be phenomenal. It can enliven the neighborhood, bring people closer together but most of all remind us of what we are truly capable of. This is how David Hywel Baynes sees these plays.</p>
<p>It sounds cliché and trite to say these plays can help change lives, but they have and will continue to do so for longer than any of us will be around. Shakespeare's works have been wowing audiences for centuries. Literally CENTURIES, and still do today. Shakespeare will always be current and will always be popular. David has been performing consistently in classical productions for years having played the likes of Benedick, Richard III, Brutus to name a few. He has received such notices as:</p>

</div></div>","Here at the New York Shakespeare Company we are endeavoring to bring Shakespeare to the city of New York, in a way they've never seen before, whilst keeping the history and traditions alive.
Critically acclaimed and award nominated Artistic Director David Hywel Baynes, moved to New York almost 10 years ago and wants to share how he feels Shakespeare can change lives with some of the greatest stories ever put to paper. He has been studying Shakespeare for his entire adult life and has experienced the giggles of the comedies, the heartbreak of the tragedies and honor in the ultra violent history plays. 
It's a different world from Shakespeare's era filled with plague, war, political unrest and the crowning of a new ruler, BUT the methods of performing his plays, successfully, haven't. In over 400 years, since these plays were written the most enjoyable and entertaining Shakespearean performances have been those that embrace the old ways, without adding superfluous elements for the sake of it. Using a combination of classical and modern techniques, David has discovered a fresh way of telling these stories and make them accessible to everyone again, because the people were who Shakespeare wrote for in the first place.
Shakespeare's writings have a power very few other writers have even come close to. A Power that make us look at ourselves and become better people. His plays are a celebration of the beautiful insanity that is the world and if there's one thing that this world needs right now, it's more celebration. If there's one thing Shakespeare's plays tell us is that we are essentially ALL just human beings, feeling human emotions, no matter where your from.

THE AWKWARD BIT...
Very much like Shakespeare on his arrival in London from Stratford, we need help with money to get us started, even modestly, we need your help.
In the interest of keeping things to the bare essentials at first, we are looking to raise $15,000 in order to tell the gruesome story of Macbeth in the summer of 2018. We put a great deal of faith in the strength of the stories Shakespeare wrote without the trappings of lavish setting and costume, which will always come second to the words he penned down.
The majority of the budget is dedicated to location, both for performance and rehearsal, which takes up over a third of the budget alone, but New York City is the city and a Midtown location is essential to reach the most diverse and cosmopolitan audience.
In our years in the business we have experienced how hard it is for actors to survive whilst looking to build a career in entertainment. A tough thing to do at any stretch. Actors sacrifice a great deal of their time to try and be as prepared and as good for the paying audience as they can be, they deserve something for their troubles.
There's been a trend over the last 20 years of actors getting paid less and less but asked to work harder and harder, to now when it's incredibly rare for actors to receive anything for their troubles and hard work. We hope to compensate all artists, because an artist that feels appreciated is going to give their best performance. See? It's in everyone's interest. 
The Ensemble, including cast and crew, will receive a stipend of $250 for their time and effort. Gratitude is a lost virtue. We would like to help bring it back. Until we are more settled and established, we will offer what we can, but always offer something.
In performing a play like Macbeth, there are simply going to be some essential props and set dressing that are necessary when attempting such a visual play. Shakespeare's plays lend themselves to the economically sound and thriftily inclined, but there are just some things needed to do one of the greatest plays of all time justice. Just remember ""Blood will have blood"", and laundry is a wonderful thing when looking to get those pesky blood stains out. We will need cleaning materials. Lots of cleaning materials.
Another expenditure that is unavoidable when trying to build a name and brand is of course Marketing. We are confident that our productions will speak for themselves as the years go by, but that's no good when no-one is aware we or the production exists. Advertising and marketing is already well on it's way, with the poster designed and ready to share with the public, and tickets on sale now. 
We need people to see the show and as such we have put a modest amount toward our marketing strategy, aiming to utilize post boosting on social media which will directly target specific audiences who have already created connections with already established companies here in NYC. 
Any money helps but if we fail to reach our goal, we'll put the money we do raise, toward a postponed production of Macbeth. This play has been too long in the making to not be shown. 

What We Can Achieve
The effects of a well presented Shakespeare production can be phenomenal. It can enliven the neighborhood, bring people closer together but most of all remind us of what we are truly capable of. This is how David Hywel Baynes sees these plays.
It sounds cliché and trite to say these plays can help change lives, but they have and will continue to do so for longer than any of us will be around. Shakespeare's works have been wowing audiences for centuries. Literally CENTURIES, and still do today. Shakespeare will always be current and will always be popular. David has been performing consistently in classical productions for years having played the likes of Benedick, Richard III, Brutus to name a few. He has received such notices as:

""David Hywel Baynes is the best Richard III I've ever seen...he delivers his lines with passion and conviction and the audience hangs on to his every word."" - West End Wilma
“David Hywel Baynes is a compelling, conflicted Brutus” - The Times (UK)
“the outstanding David Hywel Baynes... his beautiful verse-speaking brings crispness and clarity to Richard” - What’s On Stage
""David's performance [Macbeth] is amazingly passionate and menacing, a grand follow-up from his Offie-nominated performance in 2014′s Iris production of Richard III"" - Voice Mag Uk
David prides himself on his deep connection to the works of Shakespeare. There is a duty for these plays to be treated with utmost respect, but also not to forget that they must be entertaining. Shakespeare's plays have acquired a reputation over the last few years as old fashioned. There is so much more to them than just skulls and being or not being.
The ensemble has already been working closely for years, and have developed methods that have possibilities way beyond the performance arena. Using very specific and unorthodox exercises, they have discovered methods of bringing people together and build teams from any profession or walk of life.

<h3>The Buried Story So Far...</h3>
<p>We wrote Buried at University in Sheffield, England, whilst we were in our final semester there in 2017. The show itself is a folk-inspired, darkly comedic musical about Rose and Harry; <strong>two serial killers who accidentally meet on a date.</strong> It’s a romantic-comedy with a razor sharp edge, and through its biting wit and soaring, soulful score, Buried demonstrates how love is unique to everyone whilst illuminating the darkness in us all.</p>
<p>We took Buried to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2017 and it became a festival hit.  We sold out all performances of our 155 seater venue, and went on to win<strong> the Sunday Times National Student Drama Festival Edinburgh Award.</strong> This award led to further sell-out runs at the Leicester Curve, where we won <strong>The Cameron Mackintosh Award</strong>, and at the Pleasance Theatre, London, where we also recorded a <strong>live album</strong>. You can listen to it here:</p>
<p><strong>On Spotify</strong> - <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/4jQPUYFvwIB6RZfrTeW24a?%20si=wTuX72UTSBajjbTlKOrNLg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://open.spotify.com/album/4jQPUYFvwIB6RZfr...</a></p>
<p><strong>On Apple Music</strong> - <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/buried-the-musical-live-at-the-pleasance-theatre/1417703331"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/buried-the-mu...</a> </p>
<p>We then returned to Edinburgh in 2018 after a year’s development and sold out our run for the second time, this time in a 200 seater venue with many audience members coming back to see the show multiple times. We even sold out of t-shirts before our run's midway point.</p>
<p>Buried has also been incredibly well received critically.  British Theatre described the show as <strong>""perversely charming and entertaining""</strong>, remarking on the <strong>""richly melodic and soulful”</strong> score, and Paul Vale from The Stage said the songs were <strong>“some of the best you will possibly hear in Edinburgh”</strong>. The Skinny called the show <strong>“a witty, remarkably touching and sentimental journey of self-respect and love. Oh, and a whole lot of murder.”</strong>, and Musical Theatre Review stated that <strong>“Buried is something we are all looking for – one of those nuggets that is waiting to be found”.</strong> </p>

<h3>What is The New York Musical Theatre Festival?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The New York Musical Theatre Festival is the most prestigious new musical festival in the world, known locally as ‘The Sundance of Musical Theatre’ for its role as the birthplace of exciting, genre-busting new musical theatre. Shows that take part in the festival are <strong>regularly transferred to longer Off-Broadway runs, US tours and some have even transferred to Broadway</strong>. Here is a link to the website for more information - <a href=""http://www.nymf.org/about/alumni-awards/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.nymf.org/about/alumni-awards/</a> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What could happen with Buried at the festival?</h3>
<p>When in New York in mid-March, Tom and Cordelia found that the buzz surrounding Buried’s participation in NYMF is already building rapidly, for both its unique music, tone and subject matter. </p>
<p>Mainstream entertainment is saturated with serial killer themes, particularly in America. Their audiences are not only fascinated by it, but the preponderance of serial killer series such as Dexter, The Following, Mindhunter, True Detective, The Alienist, Conversations With A Killer and many others have led to a super appetite for this genre. </p>
<p>Combined with its very British dark humour and the unconventional yet catchy score, we’re confident that Buried will appeal to a very wide audience and to the media as well. Looking at NYMF’s track record of successes, we think that Buried has a very promising commercial future, and is a rare, truly exciting, home-grown project to get behind.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Money...</h3>
<p>Up until now, we have been independently funding each stage of the production with profit from the previous show, merchandise and crowdfunding, but the cost of getting our show to New York is a different ball game. </p>
<p>Our travel and accommodation costs are inevitably high (turns out you can’t get the Megabus to New York), alongside hiring a general manager, insurance, set, lighting and sound designers amongst many other things that unfortunately really do add up! </p>
<p>This £15,000 would provide us with a solid chunk of what we need to get Buried over to New York, but we are also seeking funding elsewhere to add to the production value of the show, the marketing/advertising that could give Buried bigger audiences when over there, rehearsal space when in New York and more staff involved in our production team to ensure the show runs as smoothly as possible.  Our ideal budget is nearing £50,000, so you can imagine our constant states of stress/emotional breakdowns...</p>
<p>If you would like to donate a bigger sum privately please email Tom and Cordelia at williamsodriscoll@gmail.com .  It is worth noting that if you are a US taxpayer all funding can be donated directly to the New York Musical Theatre Festival as a fiscal sponsor and then transferred to us, meaning it is tax deductible. The New York Musical Theatre Festival is a certified 501(c)(3) organisation so under the US Internal Revenue Code, it is tax exempt. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why You Should Donate...</h3>

</div></div>","The Buried Story So Far...
We wrote Buried at University in Sheffield, England, whilst we were in our final semester there in 2017. The show itself is a folk-inspired, darkly comedic musical about Rose and Harry; two serial killers who accidentally meet on a date. It’s a romantic-comedy with a razor sharp edge, and through its biting wit and soaring, soulful score, Buried demonstrates how love is unique to everyone whilst illuminating the darkness in us all.
We took Buried to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2017 and it became a festival hit.  We sold out all performances of our 155 seater venue, and went on to win the Sunday Times National Student Drama Festival Edinburgh Award. This award led to further sell-out runs at the Leicester Curve, where we won The Cameron Mackintosh Award, and at the Pleasance Theatre, London, where we also recorded a live album. You can listen to it here:
On Spotify - https://open.spotify.com/album/4jQPUYFvwIB6RZfr...
On Apple Music - https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/buried-the-mu... 
We then returned to Edinburgh in 2018 after a year’s development and sold out our run for the second time, this time in a 200 seater venue with many audience members coming back to see the show multiple times. We even sold out of t-shirts before our run's midway point.
Buried has also been incredibly well received critically.  British Theatre described the show as ""perversely charming and entertaining"", remarking on the ""richly melodic and soulful” score, and Paul Vale from The Stage said the songs were “some of the best you will possibly hear in Edinburgh”. The Skinny called the show “a witty, remarkably touching and sentimental journey of self-respect and love. Oh, and a whole lot of murder.”, and Musical Theatre Review stated that “Buried is something we are all looking for – one of those nuggets that is waiting to be found”. 
 
What is The New York Musical Theatre Festival?

The New York Musical Theatre Festival is the most prestigious new musical festival in the world, known locally as ‘The Sundance of Musical Theatre’ for its role as the birthplace of exciting, genre-busting new musical theatre. Shows that take part in the festival are regularly transferred to longer Off-Broadway runs, US tours and some have even transferred to Broadway. Here is a link to the website for more information - http://www.nymf.org/about/alumni-awards/ 
 
What could happen with Buried at the festival?
When in New York in mid-March, Tom and Cordelia found that the buzz surrounding Buried’s participation in NYMF is already building rapidly, for both its unique music, tone and subject matter. 
Mainstream entertainment is saturated with serial killer themes, particularly in America. Their audiences are not only fascinated by it, but the preponderance of serial killer series such as Dexter, The Following, Mindhunter, True Detective, The Alienist, Conversations With A Killer and many others have led to a super appetite for this genre. 
Combined with its very British dark humour and the unconventional yet catchy score, we’re confident that Buried will appeal to a very wide audience and to the media as well. Looking at NYMF’s track record of successes, we think that Buried has a very promising commercial future, and is a rare, truly exciting, home-grown project to get behind.
 

The Money...
Up until now, we have been independently funding each stage of the production with profit from the previous show, merchandise and crowdfunding, but the cost of getting our show to New York is a different ball game. 
Our travel and accommodation costs are inevitably high (turns out you can’t get the Megabus to New York), alongside hiring a general manager, insurance, set, lighting and sound designers amongst many other things that unfortunately really do add up! 
This £15,000 would provide us with a solid chunk of what we need to get Buried over to New York, but we are also seeking funding elsewhere to add to the production value of the show, the marketing/advertising that could give Buried bigger audiences when over there, rehearsal space when in New York and more staff involved in our production team to ensure the show runs as smoothly as possible.  Our ideal budget is nearing £50,000, so you can imagine our constant states of stress/emotional breakdowns...
If you would like to donate a bigger sum privately please email Tom and Cordelia at williamsodriscoll@gmail.com .  It is worth noting that if you are a US taxpayer all funding can be donated directly to the New York Musical Theatre Festival as a fiscal sponsor and then transferred to us, meaning it is tax deductible. The New York Musical Theatre Festival is a certified 501(c)(3) organisation so under the US Internal Revenue Code, it is tax exempt. 
 
Why You Should Donate...
Alongside our range of great perks you'll see on the side, you'd be helping a grassroots, British musical make its first steps into New York Theatre. 
For 2 years we've been doing this show for the love, with no promise of any return or definite future life. Now, we're on the precipice of potentially really big things for the show, but as young, up and coming artists with little to no connections to the upper echelons of theatre funding, its been a struggle to get through to those who could help. Unfortunately, if we don't manage to raise this money we simply can't go.
We really believe in Buried and everyone involved, and we think our track record of success from the last 2 years has proved we're more than ready for this, but we really need this financial help to push it through to these hugely exciting next steps.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you're unable to contribute financially, we would be eternally grateful if you could share this campaign around with anyone you can think of who might want to donate. We're very quickly running out of time, so any person who could be interested is definitely worth being told!

<p><strong>What is Almacén 63? </strong></p>
<p><strong><i>(Véase la versión en español al final)</i></strong></p>
<p>Almacén 63 is a multidisciplinary arts space that opened its doors in 2015 under the administration of local dancer and cultural administrator Loaya I. Quesada. Since its inception, Almacén has stood out not only as a venue for artistic creation, collaboration and exploration for local artists from a wide range of disciplines, but also as a center for members of the community to access artistic proposals and explore their own creative potential. This multifaceted space featured classes, workshops, educational and cultural presentations, art exhibitions and movie nights, and served as a stage for performances where people from all walks of Puertorrican society would come to meet up and connect with their bodies and with other people from different age groups and backgrounds.</p>
<p>The space hosted major local companies such as Claroscuro and Taller Teatro Camándula, and was the home base for Nailah Dance Company, which stand out for their technical and artistic caliber, as well as for promoting a cultural dialogue among all levels of society. This versatile venue has also been utilized as a rehearsal space for theater productions and musicians alike, as well as a recording studio and a gallery space for local artists. One of the most significant projects to be born out of this space was the event <i>La Leche</i>, a forum for a new generation of Puertorrican artists to expose their work. In the three years since its creation, Almacén 63 became a vital community space that empowered and fostered creation and dialogue.</p>
<p>In October 2017, as a result of the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria and the socioeconomic challenges facing Puertorricans, Almacén 63’s administration made the decision to close its doors. For those who did not experience it, it is almost impossible to understand in any meaningful way the level of uncertainty, chaos and anxiety caused by Hurricane Maria, which left practically 100% of the island without power service and telecommunications networks, and a high percentage of its residents without potable water or safe access to food or medical services. To this day, about 5% of our island is still without electricity, many traffic lights and streetlights are not functional and thousands of families are facing the difficult decision of moving to the US.</p>

<p>I am a professional translator and interpreter, bellydancer and writer. In 2009, I left Puerto Rico to pursue a Master’s Degree in translation and interpretation in Monterey, California. Last year, after eight years in the US, I returned to San Juan, excited about finding ways in which I could help my country.</p>
<p>As a young person growing up in the island, I struggled with my desire to pursue art as a serious occupation and find the means to support myself financially and be able to help my family. In the environment where I grew up, there was a dearth of spaces for cultural and artistic exploration and training, in particular for those of us who could not afford private lessons.</p>
<p>Even though I have been successful in my profession, I have always needed art in my life. However, the narrative that art is not a stable source of income, that it is not to be taken seriously, has been ingrained in me and in those around me since we were children. I believe that having a safe space where we can foster artists is key to developing the artistic potential of the next generations.</p>
<p>Since I was a teenager, I dreamt of opening an arts space to bring together artists from many disciplines to teach and create, a place where I could give others what I didn't have growing up: access, encouragement and support for those dreaming of a career in the arts. I always thought it would take decades to cultivate this, but Hurricane Maria surprised us all, and it surprised me with this unique opportunity to make my dream come true way ahead of schedule. For all the above reasons, I made the decision of purchasing the space and continuing with the work begun in 2015.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>The funds raised through this campaign will allow us to rehabilitate the space with everything it needs to reopen its doors:</p>
<p>-dance/stage floor</p>
<p>-lighting system</p>
<p>-fans/AC system (it gets really hot in there)</p>
<p>-dance floor mirrors</p>
<p>-furniture (desks, dressing room mirrors and lights, seating/chairs, storage)</p>
<p>-paint</p>
<p>-miscellaneous repairs</p>
<p>-recording studio setup</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Today more than ever, as we live in the midst of an unprecedented political and financial crisis, there is a need to build community spaces that allow us to cultivate artistic creation in the island. Art is and always will be a tool that allows us to imagine other worlds, connect with other ideas and imagine that which seems impossible from our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Upon reopening, Almacén 63 will be registered as a non-profit organization, allowing it to apply for state and federal funding, accept private donations for its ongoing projects and grant scholarships to provide access to classes and supplies for disadvantaged people.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The Puertorrican economy has certainly seen better days. Hurricane Maria dealt a deathly blow to our vulnerable power infrastructure on September 20th, 2017. As previously mentioned, even six months after the hurricane, about 5% of the population still lacks power service. Flying into San Juan Airport, you can see hundreds of blue tarps covering people's roofs. It is estimated that between 100,000 to 200,000 people have left the island, and more leave every day, which represents an alarming level of brain drain and a severe loss for our economy. Yet some of us have decided to stay —or return— in order to rebuild.</p>
<p>I believe in my country. I returned with a tiny seed of a vision to do something, because it's up to us, not some unspecified other, to create the community we want to see. Since I returned to Puerto Rico less than a year ago, I have met lots of creative and extremely talented people that fire up my imagination and inspire me with their ideas. These visionaries are very knowledgeable, have a lot to offer and yet are very humble. I truly believe these people are my country's hope for a better future. It begins with a place where they can come together and collaborate. Almacén 63 provided such a safe space for artists and for the community to interact with art, and we need that space once again.</p>

<p><strong>¿Qué es el Almacén 63?</strong></p>
<p>Almacén 63 es un foro multidisciplinario que abrió sus puertas en el 2015 bajo la dirección de la bailarina y administradora cultural local Loaya I. Quesada. Desde sus inicios, el Almacén se ha desempeñado no solo como sede de creación artística, colaboración y exploración para artistas locales de diversas disciplinas, sino también como un centro que permite a la comunidad que lo rodea acceder a propuestas artísticas y explorar su propia capacidad creativa.  En este versátil espacio se ofrecían clases de baile, talleres de artes escénicas y funciones de música a los cuales acudían personas de todos los sectores de la sociedad puertorriqueña para congregarse y conectarse con su cuerpo y con otras personas de distintas edades y clases sociales.</p>
<p>El Almacén acogió a importantes compañías locales como Claroscuro y Taller Teatro Camándula, y sirvió de sede para Nailah Dance Company, las cuales se destacan por su calibre técnico y artístico, así como por promover el diálogo cultural entre todos los ámbitos de la sociedad. Este multifacético foro también se ha utilizado como espacio de ensayo para producciones teatrales y grupos musicales, así como estudio de grabación y espacio de exposición de artistas locales. Uno de los proyectos más significativos nacidos de este espacio fue el evento La Leche, un foro para que una nueva generación de artistas puertorriqueños exponga su arte. En los tres años desde su creación, el Almacén 63 se convirtió en un baluarte de la comunidad que facilitaba y fomentaba la creación y el diálogo.</p>
<p>En octubre de 2017, a raíz de la devastación ocasionada por el huracán María y los grandes retos socioeconómicos a los que se enfrentaban todos los puertorriqueños, la gestora toma la decisión de cerrar las puertas del Almacén 63. Para quien no lo vivió, se hace casi imposible entender de forma cabal el nivel de incertidumbre, caos y ansiedad que produjo el huracán María, el cual dejó a prácticamente el 100% de la población sin servicio eléctrico y sin redes de telecomunicación, y a un alto porcentaje de habitantes sin servicio de agua potable ni acceso seguro a alimentos o servicios médicos. Al día de hoy, aproximadamente un 5% de la isla todavía carece de servicio eléctrico, muchos semáforos y postes de alumbrado público permanecen sin funcionar y miles de familias se enfrentan a la difícil decisión de mudarse a los Estados Unidos.</p>

<p>De joven, mientras crecía en Puerto Rico, tuve muchas dificultades para reconciliar mi deseo de dedicarme seriamente a una carrera artística y tener los medios para mantenerme económicamente y poder ayudar a mi familia. En el ambiente en el que me crié, escaseaban los espacios de exploración y educación cultural y artística, en particular para aquellos que no podíamos costear clases privadas.</p>
<p>A pesar de que he tenido éxito en mi profesión, siempre he necesitado el arte en mi vida. Sin embargo, la narrativa de que el arte no es una fuente estable de ingresos, de que no se debe tomar en serio, es algo que se nos ha inculcado a mí y a los que me rodean desde que éramos niños. Mi creencia es que disponer de un espacio seguro donde podamos acoger al artista resulta clave para el desarrollo del potencial artístico de las próximas generaciones.</p>
<p>Desde que era adolescente, he soñado con abrir un espacio artístico para reunir a artistas de muchas disciplinas donde estos puedan enseñar y crear, y un lugar donde pueda darles a otros lo que yo no tuve de joven: acceso, aliento y apoyo para aquellos que sueñan con una carrera en las artes.

(Véase la versión en español al final)
Almacén 63 is a multidisciplinary arts space that opened its doors in 2015 under the administration of local dancer and cultural administrator Loaya I. Quesada. Since its inception, Almacén has stood out not only as a venue for artistic creation, collaboration and exploration for local artists from a wide range of disciplines, but also as a center for members of the community to access artistic proposals and explore their own creative potential. This multifaceted space featured classes, workshops, educational and cultural presentations, art exhibitions and movie nights, and served as a stage for performances where people from all walks of Puertorrican society would come to meet up and connect with their bodies and with other people from different age groups and backgrounds.
The space hosted major local companies such as Claroscuro and Taller Teatro Camándula, and was the home base for Nailah Dance Company, which stand out for their technical and artistic caliber, as well as for promoting a cultural dialogue among all levels of society. This versatile venue has also been utilized as a rehearsal space for theater productions and musicians alike, as well as a recording studio and a gallery space for local artists. One of the most significant projects to be born out of this space was the event La Leche, a forum for a new generation of Puertorrican artists to expose their work. In the three years since its creation, Almacén 63 became a vital community space that empowered and fostered creation and dialogue.
In October 2017, as a result of the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria and the socioeconomic challenges facing Puertorricans, Almacén 63’s administration made the decision to close its doors. For those who did not experience it, it is almost impossible to understand in any meaningful way the level of uncertainty, chaos and anxiety caused by Hurricane Maria, which left practically 100% of the island without power service and telecommunications networks, and a high percentage of its residents without potable water or safe access to food or medical services. To this day, about 5% of our island is still without electricity, many traffic lights and streetlights are not functional and thousands of families are facing the difficult decision of moving to the US.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Seven Starving Artists is a new, emerging Canadian theatre company in Calgary, Alberta with a passion for telling new stories that give the underrepresented a voice. Producing <i>All That's Left </i>will not only contribute to Canada's theatre culture, but will also allow our company to begin to make a name for itself. This play will not be possible without your help to raise these funds, and we appreciate any and all donations you can make!</p>

<li>$1100 facility rental fee</li>
<li>$500 damage deposit (refundable)</li>
<li>$200 production costs <ul><li>Costumes, set, makeup, etc.</li></ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Art is the lens through which we understand and view our experiences; we believe in the importance of queer theatre and of seeing yourself represented on stage. <i>All That's Left </i>is about processing and healing from the communal trauma and violence that the LGBTQ+ community faces as part of our daily reality. We hope that this production will help to build connections among the community and its allies in Calgary.</p>
<p><i>All That's Left </i>has had two successful workshops so far, the first through the University of Lethbridge's TheatreXtra, and the second through Sage Theatre's IGNITE! Festival for Emerging Artists</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Starting a new theatre company and producing a new and unknown play will always be risky- we know that there is always the chance that we won't be able to find an audience for our work. We are prepared to market actively and invest our own money into this project as necessary. </p>
<p>Queer theatre can also be challenging, particularly in Southern Alberta; that's why we plan to reach out to local LGBTQ+ programs and organizations for their connections and support. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help us get the word out about <i>All That's Left </i>by sharing this campaign, and be sure to buy tickets to attend the production this July!</p>

Art is the lens through which we understand and view our experiences; we believe in the importance of queer theatre and of seeing yourself represented on stage. All That's Left is about processing and healing from the communal trauma and violence that the LGBTQ+ community faces as part of our daily reality. We hope that this production will help to build connections among the community and its allies in Calgary.
All That's Left has had two successful workshops so far, the first through the University of Lethbridge's TheatreXtra, and the second through Sage Theatre's IGNITE! Festival for Emerging Artists

Risks & Challenges
Starting a new theatre company and producing a new and unknown play will always be risky- we know that there is always the chance that we won't be able to find an audience for our work. We are prepared to market actively and invest our own money into this project as necessary. 
Queer theatre can also be challenging, particularly in Southern Alberta; that's why we plan to reach out to local LGBTQ+ programs and organizations for their connections and support.

<p>My name is Cai Brigden. I graduated from the Guildhall school of music and drama in 2011 and now work as a professional actor in Theatre, Film and Television.</p>
<p>For the last couple years, I have been involved with Soho Theatre's SYC  - writing and performing Sketch and Stand Up Comedy.</p>
<p>Now I’ve written a brand new play called <strong><i>Entropy</i></strong>, about Love and Quantum physics. The aim of this campaign is to raise funds needed to premiere the play in Edinburgh. </p>
<p><i><strong>Entropy</strong></i> is unique in that it deals with Love from the perspective of Quantum Physics, exploring scientific concepts such as chaos and uncertainty, and their place within human relationships.</p>
<p><br/>The plot involves a physicist on the brink of being able to explain the mysteries of the universe, but he still can’t figure out his volatile relationship with a rising star. In his struggle to grasp answers, he begins to lose his grip on everything.<br/>A volatile hour of clashes and kisses: Entropy is a war of head vs heart and logic vs impulse.<br/>It's funny, sad, and thought provoking.</p>
<p><strong>SO FAR</strong>...</p>
<p>I am thrilled to have teamed up with The Space Venues in Edinburgh and to be performing at the Perth Theatre, on Northbridge - a charming 50 seater venue that is perfect for our piece.<br/>The folks at The Space have offered us a wealth of information about everything from marketing strategies and technical help, to industry contacts, deadlines and affordable Edinburgh accommodation.</p>
<p>Onboard so far are:</p>
<p><strong>David Kirkbride - Director</strong><br/>We have enlisted the sharp, energetic directorial mind of David Kirkbride who also trained at Guildhall.<br/>David has been directing and assistant directing since the age of 15 when he started creating theatre shows. He was the Assistant Director of the Arden Theatre Company from 2003-7. Then helped create Vivid Theatre Company from 2007-2010.</p>
<p>He has continued to work and direct shows for The Vaults, The Caravan, Newcastle Theatre Royal, Arc, Richmix and the Union Theatre including various schools, colleges and universities.</p>
<p><strong>Producers</strong><br/>Two actor parents and a film maker sister have put forward the money to help us book the venue and get this ball rolling.<br/>This campaign is asking for your help to create a quality production and  promote the show extensively.</p>
<p>What we are asking for, here, is your help in making this production into a SUCCESS. We want to create a production that people will <i>SHOUT</i> about.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p>
<p>Here are the areas in which your donations can make this happen!</p>
<p>ACTORS<br/>A brilliant cast could deliver this play to a high standard. However, acting is a profession and talented actors can only deliver their best if they aren’t worrying about rent or their next meal.<br/>We want to pay our Actors £300 a week. It’s not a huge amount, but this will enable us to secure a talented, dedicated cast that can put their full focus on making this play special. </p>
<p>ADVERTISING<br/>Flyers, posters and press interviews will help make this production take off. That’s why we see advertising as a huge priority.<br/>£400 will pay for Flyer &amp; Poster design and distribution. Any money we raise beyond that will go towards PR and professional media coverage such as newpapers or radio.</p>
<p>REHEASALS<br/>Allowing the company time to tackle the depth and complexity of the play will help us enormously in delivering this story. We need a space to rehearse in London for a full working week.</p>
<p>TRAVEL + ACCOMODATION<br/>This may seem like a luxury to some, but this is probably the part I am most scared of. We have a booking on a 4 bedroom flat (3 actors and the Director) that will cost us £1000 for the entire stay. We think that’s a great price… but we can't actually pay for it yet.<br/>Putting a roof over the company’s head would REALLY improve the quality of this show. Please help!</p>
<p>COSTUMES<br/>Costumes are a vital part of theatre and story telling. Not only do costumes help the audience understand characters, they also help actors portray and develop them.<br/>This is a contemporary play, and we will endeavour to source costumes from family, friends, and charity shops. The more of a budget we have here, the faster we can find the perfect wardrobe for this piece.</p>
<p>SET + PROPS<br/>Entropy is set in a London flat that has been designed to look reminiscent of the 1920s-1930s. There is a degree of Nostalgia about the set that is integral to the story.<br/>As part of the set we hope to source: a sofa, a coat stand, two free standing stage doors, a chair, carpets, a small coffee table, a drinks cabinet with glasses and decanters, another chair, a stool, and a telescope.<br/>We will beg for &amp; borrow what we can, but any money raised to help us source these items responsibly would be tremendous. Help us build the world of the play!</p>

<h2><u><strong>ABOUT THE ARTIST </strong></u></h2>
<p>Victor Morales is a Venezuelan Artist based in New York City since 1991. He completed a Master’s degree in Technology Applied to the Arts at New York University's Gallatin Division, in 1992. He is a director, performer and designer, whose work includes video animation and design, text, sound design, and digital puppetry. His work has travelled the world and he has collaborated with international artist such as Chris Kondek (Berlin), Joseph Silovsky (NYC), Jim Findlay (NYC), Findlay/Sandsmark (Norway), Joachim Schloemer (Germany), Wolfgang Mitterer (Austria) among others. He is Currently the Digital Technical Director at 3 Legged Dog in NYC.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527799973/iulxxz02xkijpgemfchm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Since 2003, Victor has been obsessed with the art of video game modifications and has implemented different game engines into most of the works he has produced. His solo work consists of an exploration of video game engines as simulation environments, where death and physics are transformed into dramatic and comedic real time performance.</p>
<h2><u><strong>ABOUT THE PROJECT</strong></u></h2>
<p>Esperpento is a virtual space, inspired on the aesthetic vision of Spanish painter Francisco Goya. Specifically the War Paintings and his famous, Caprichos.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527800388/nvujdcvske5dcvdqqxbq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The project is a universe where tragedy, sarcasm, and comedy are portrayed as a deformed and apocalyptic mirror of reality; In this world, circumstance is the source of tragedy, and the grimace produced by this tragedy is what rules its form.</p>
<p>Esperpento is an exploration about the rejection of the different and the dehumanization of the stranger. Why the foreigner (who looks different) is often shunned, despised and criminalized?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527801184/zkxxtofnxagnilyw7hru.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>This virtual universe will work primarily as an immersive interactive installation and </strong><strong>performance</strong><strong> its first iteration will take place on the all Fall of 2018 at 3 Legged Dog Art and Technology Center in NYC.</strong></p>
<p>Esperpento (a Spanish literary term for “monstrosity”) is a digital performance event - a charged visual performance that allows the viewer to see through a monstrous lens. Rather than using the “monster” to critique societal ills, Esperpento embraces strangeness and deformity in order to challenge conventions of beauty, familiarity, and what is “normal” or “native” to the human condition.</p>
<p>Esperpento is a series of 3D digital events which explores the dehumanization of the stranger. In a vivid sequence of natural and manmade disasters, rendered through a real-time video game engine, victims and perpetrators collide with increasingly interchangeable ethnic, class and cultural markers. These ""Esperpento Events"" are a digital meditation on the rejection of foreignness, and why we shun those who look (or appear to look) different from the people in the US.</p>
<p>Goya’s War Disasters and Black Paintings are, in substance and form, a template for Esperpento. These paintings are a testament of genuine protest, full of style and piercing opinion, that simultaneously document and comment on reality.</p>
<p>The performance aspect of Esperpento is a play written by Billy Burns called “Two Black Lights and One Red”. The play is a free adaptation from a Spanish play “Luces de Bohemia” by Valle-Inclan. The show is about the vicissitudes of a blind Poet, Max Starpower,  who suffers through his blindness and the economic hardships of the “Esperpento” world. “Two Red Lights and a Red One"" is a full-on digital puppetry extravaganza, utilizing new techniques specially developed for the show. It will be delivered by performers and 2 puppeteers. We are happy to announce that “Max Starpower” will be played by the great “Flako” Jimenez!</p>
<p>The Latino community and other minorities will be the main focus group for this production. The technology and the delivery of the animations are the major points for connection with these communities, basically promoting technology made by and for Latinos.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking time to consider supporting us in our new endeavor. We were extremely saddened by the closure of Patrick Dorow Productions (PDP), and knew immediately that we wanted to be able to continue to work with the students who were enriching our lives each day. This fundraiser is our attempt to continue the work that we were doing with the youth and teens of the seacoast area. Funds raised will be used to secure a space to hold both classes and, hopefully, performances. Time is of the essence as we don't want to miss working with these incredibly talented students. </p>
<p>We both strongly believe the seacoast area is home to some of the most talented and professional youth and teen performers we have ever seen. These students work passionately to produce performaces that rival those of adult, professional actors. We have seen them all grow and thrive through theatre and hope to be able to give them a home to continue to do so with us. </p>
<p>Please help us continue this important work. Every dollar helps and no amount is too small... or large for that matter!</p>
<p>We thank you for your support and look forward to starting this new chapter with you. </p>

We were extremely saddened by the closure of Patrick Dorow Productions (PDP), and knew immediately that we wanted to be able to continue to work with the students who were enriching our lives each day. This fundraiser is our attempt to continue the work that we were doing with the youth and teens of the seacoast area. Funds raised will be used to secure a space to hold both classes and, hopefully, performances. Time is of the essence as we don't want to miss working with these incredibly talented students. 
We both strongly believe the seacoast area is home to some of the most talented and professional youth and teen performers we have ever seen. These students work passionately to produce performaces that rival those of adult, professional actors. We have seen them all grow and thrive through theatre and hope to be able to give them a home to continue to do so with us. 
Please help us continue this important work. Every dollar helps and no amount is too small... or large for that matter!
We thank you for your support and look forward to starting this new chapter with you.

We have made this piece to examine & challenge our complicity while imagining a world in which justice is possible. Your support would allow us to start dialogue with audience on what our responsibility is as individuals in creating a more hopeful and just future for our world.Thank you for any & all help you're able to provide. All our love & gratitude,The IN THE WOODS team",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is a talented, dedicated, and amazing troupe of actors, but this is a public high school on a shoe-string budget, and not all of the students' families can afford to send their young actors on this valuable trip.</p>
<p><strong>Each student's festival cost is $1500, including airfare and other travel expenses, and tuition/room/board for the festival itself. </strong></p>
<p>Each student's family was asked to complete a permission form, confidentially stating whether they could afford all, half, or none of the cost. Talent comes from all walks of life, and SET wants to make sure nobody is left behind for lack of funds. </p>
<p><strong>$7500 will be a scholarship fund to allow all who need help.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We have already raised $1500 towards this fund, through ticket sales, refreshment sales, and a ""1-minute donation spree"" at two weekend performances of the three one-acts, and through individual fundraising efforts by the students.</strong></li>
<li><strong>That leaves $6000 still to raise. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Because the Indiegogo platform and credit card/Paypal systems take a percentage of the contributions, we are adding $200 to the goal to help cover this cost.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Perks- Tokens of our appreciation for you</h3>
<p>While it would be impossible to truly give back what we receive by your generous contribution, we do have a selection of ""perks"" that you may choose at different contribution levels.</p>
<p>Everything from a postcard from Nebraska, to a poster of one of the SET shows of this past season, to a pair of season tickets to the 2017-18 SET season, if you are in the area, and want to guarantee yourself some great theater that you helped create! </p>
<h3>The Impact - You are helping to fund the Arts and Education!</h3>
</div><div>
<p><strong>In this day of reduced funding for the Arts, for Education, and for the things that give our lives meaning, but take money to do, it is even more important to support our youth. </strong></p>

<p><strong>You can be part of this!</strong></p>
<p>If you help these students go to Nationals, you will be helping an excellent high school theater department do even more, helping public school students know they are supported in the arts, and helping, maybe, to develop a young actor who just might do something important in the future to change the world!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>What if we don't reach our goal?  We are determined to leave no one behind. Every dollar you give, even if you ONLY give a dollar, will be one more moment on the stage for a student. ALL money will be used towards the scholarships for students whose families have financial hardships preventing them from being able to simply put this trip on a credit card.</p>
<p><strong>What if we go OVER the goal? </strong></p>
<p> That would, of course, be amazing! If we go over the total goal of $7500, then any additional funds will go directly to the South Eugene Theater program for the upcoming year. To produce more student works. To upgrade equipment for lighting and sound and sets. To make better costumes. Anywhere needed.</p>

South Eugene Theater (SET) has produced three one-act plays which were selected at the Oregon State competition in Salem to represent Oregon at the International Thespian Festival in Lincoln, Nebraska this June. Thirteen members of the SET troupe will be presenting these plays on a stage at the festival:

“Less Than Kind” by junior Elena Freck, Oregon Thespians’ 2017 playwriting champion.

<p>Dear PTW friends, and others in the International Development Community</p>
<p>It is my pleasure to announce that I have been accepted to continue my training as a Dance Therapist at the 92nd Streeet Y in New York City. After being part of the International Class at the East Side Institute, I decided to take the next step. Joining my love of dance with Social Therapy is the realization of that step. Training as a dance therapist will allow me to help with greater precision and passion the thousands of people in Peru and in other parts of the world have been affected by environmental pollution and the effects of climate change.</p>

It is my pleasure to announce that I have been accepted to continue my training as a Dance Therapist at the 92nd Streeet Y in New York City. After being part of the International Class at the East Side Institute, I decided to take the next step. Joining my love of dance with Social Therapy is the realization of that step. Training as a dance therapist will allow me to help with greater precision and passion the thousands of people in Peru and in other parts of the world have been affected by environmental pollution and the effects of climate change.

<h3>The Revivalists</h3>
<p>Revivalists are those who look to restore important facets of our shared culture.  During the 2017 Philadelphia Neighborhood Fringe Festival, the Revivalists will be presenting UNITED in the courtyard of the historic Betsy Ross House September 9, 15, 16, 22, &amp; 23.  UNITED is a new, immersive musical drawing on stories and songs from American history and folk tradition to challenge audiences to reinvest in our country's founding principles.  We look to revive the experiences of those who chose to forgo the comfort of their day to day lives and engage with the ideals of independence, liberty and and the equality of all Americans.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where Does My Donation Go?</h3>
<p>In order to complete UNITED we need to raise $1,500.  These funds will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Rehearsal and performance space rental:  $850</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Design elements:<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Set &amp; props:  $350</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Insurance:  $150</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>For Me?</h3>
<p>We want to ensure that all donors to this production are able to join us for the performance in September! Every $50 donated entitles you, the donor, to one free ticket to Opening Night or another performance of your choosing.  We cannot express enough how grateful we are for your generosity, and we look forward to standing united with you to celebrate our shared liberties during the run of this show!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges of UNITED</h3>
<p>Creating a new, original piece that draws on founding American principles requires blending both our unique personal beliefs and found text from American history built on the beliefs of others. This challenges the entire team behind UNITED to build on what makes us unique as people and Americans in order to share the universalities of our Americaness with our audience. Another challenge of UNITED is garnering support for new works of theatre. We are fortunate to build UNITED in Philadelphia, the birthplace of American liberty, among so many other great artists building shows for the Fringe Festival.  We have to do our best to not only stand out, but also support the other artists who are creating in conjunction with UNITED.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Are There Other Ways You Can Help?</h3>
<p>Absolutely!  Now, while any donation is greatly appreciated, we understand that not everyone is able to contribute financially.  But you can still help by talking about UNITED!  Word of mouth will go just as far as a donation!  Tell your friends, family, post about UNITED on Facebook, share it, retweet it,  and help us get the message of UNITED to as many people as possible! And come see the show!</p>

<h3>Summary of the Dance Film</h3>
<p>“Embodying Emily: Death and Letters” is a dance film inspired by the poems and letters written by Emily Dickinson, particularly during the period of 1858-1865. This work is a creative imagining of a moment of self-reflection and illumination by Dickinson. The choreography in particular seeks to examine and to embody the intersection of several of Emily's extraordinary life experiences, including her dynamic emotional states, her heightened intellect, her creative productivity, and her purported mental illness. </p> <p>Dickinson encapsulated into poems a period of immense personal suffering - a time she referred to in her letters to few as “the terror” - that carried her into a life of near-total isolation. Although she was incredibly productive as a writer during this eight-year period, her sister-in-law Susan H. G. Dickinson concluded that Emily ""was never willing to face the world"" through the publication of her poems because of the vulnerability and exposure such a publication would require. Perhaps this vulnerability is best described in Emily's own words, 'This is my letter to the world, That never wrote to me.... sweet countrymen, Judge tenderly of me!""</p> <p>As the choreographer of “Embodying Emily,” I researched the life of Dickinson and her struggles with agoraphobia and a myriad of personal torments and fears. Dickinson was hardly recognized in her time as an artist of value because of her gender, her class position, and the dearth of published work in her lifetime. Although she wrote thousands of poems, only ten were said to have been published while she was alive, sometimes anonymously. My movement was directly influenced by specific poems by Dickinson, including “He Fumbles at Your Spirit” and “How Many Flowers Fail in Wood.” I am inspired by Emily Dickinson's artistic life as both a unique creative experience and as a lens through which to understand the experiences of many artists past and present. I have used movement to explore the existential questions so many creative people face as they struggle to embody and express the value of a life dedicated to making art; as they continue to pursue their craft through seasons of plenty and productivity, and seasons of want and isolation.</p>
<p><br/>Every aspect of the film's production will engage with the life and legacy of Emily Dickinson's intersecting creative and personal experiences as she expressed them in her writings, attending especially to questions of seasonality and nature. The filming will take place in a secluded area of the Virginia woods with a piano on site. The music is the first movement of Opus 90 by Franz Schubert. The costuming is designed specifically to handle the snags and tears that will come with dancing on the forest floor. Careful thought has gone into the development of a storyboard to make sure the best light hits at opportune moments in the choreography to convey the several layers of significance in the embodied movement.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I am looking for your support in this two-part fundraiser to raise a total of $6,500. The vast majority of the funds (90%) will go towards paying the artists involved for their labor; to be able to fairly compensate all artists involved is a prime goal of this project. As experts in their fields, the artists who bring this project to life have carefully and passionately developed their craft over years of work; recognizing the value of their labor and accomplishments, particularly considering Dickinson’s own complicated experiences as an underrecognized artist during her lifetime, is essential. Such support is especially crucial in this time of uncertainty for artists in the United States, and around the world, during the pandemic. </p> <p>The first round of fundraising, which aims to raise $3,000, will support the artists in the rehearsal process, costume design, set design, and the filming. Filming is set to begin at the end of August or beginning of September. The second round of fundraising, totaling $3,500, will support post-film work, including editing, finalizing, premiering, and distributing the film. My hope for this film is not only to premiere it for my sponsors and audience members but also to submit the final product to dance and film festivals, arts competitions, and make it available for widespread educational outreach. </p>

<p>We’re taking our first theatre production <strong>THE FALL</strong> into the next phase of its development. Help us tackle Mental Health stigma in the workplace via an innovative and provocative theatrical format inspired by video games and dystopian thrillers.</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Imagine Black Mirror, 1984 and Battle Royale meeting up with multidisciplinary theatre.</p>
<p><strong>THE FALL</strong> is  an immersive and interactive digital live theatre show exploring the impact of stress in the workplace on Mental Health. The project, inspired by role playing video games, will feature multiple scenarios regarding Mental Health in the workplace in which the audience will become players.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Burnout, “the disease of our generation”, a phenomenon disturbingly increasing, and now affecting young adults at the beginning of their careers. From individuals to health professionals, we have spoken to various people about their experiences of stress in the workplace and its impact on mental health. Their stories are distressing. </p>
<p><i>“Over 11 million working days are lost each year because of work-related stress, and stress can contribute to conditions such as anxiety or depression. And nearly half a million people in the UK have work-related stress at a level that makes them feel ill.”</i></p>
<p>- Dr Adrian Raby, General Practitioner.</p>
<p> <strong>97%</strong> of people who responded to our first round research survey indicated an experience with one or more symptoms of burnout in the workplace but <strong>41%</strong> of people hadn’t heard of or were unsure about what burnout even was. </p>
<p>These stories are important. They deserve to be told and we want to put you in the driving seat.</p>

<li>Test our concept on diverse and targeted audiences, collecting feedback.</li>

<li>Connect with future collaborators and partners.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>In parallel with rehearsals, we’ll organise various outreaches via surveys, interviews and workshops to a wide demographic. We believe discrimination in the workplace increases stress and therefore we will have a special focus on underrepresented groups.</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p><strong>RUCKLE</strong> Theatre is a new female-led theatre company founded by Emilie Largier and Libby Symons. We are two creatives, actors and physical theatre trained performers.  We met training at <a href=""https://www.fourthmonkey.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fourth Monkey Actor Training Company</a> (2018-2020), where we were taught by inspiring theatre makers such as Alexandra Spencer-Jones (Action to the World), Simone Coxall, Guillaume Pigé (Theatre Re) and Rich Rusk (Gecko Theatre), to name but a few. Inspired by neuroscience, sociology and psychology, we make visual and political work that challenges our audience, highlighting voices that are often left unheard.</p>
<p>Emilie is our director and a physical theatre force to be reckoned with, she is also part of the Young Vic Director Program. Libby is a fierce and instinctive actor who joined  Em in this adventure with selfish intentions, having always wanted to explore these themes through theatre. </p>
<p>We both have volunteered with the British Red Cross as Roleplay actors to train the Psychological Support Team and are experienced in immersive theatre with a gameplay aspect, (Boomtown 2019, The Vaults 2019).</p>
<p>We are grateful to be strongly supported by an incredible and talented team of artists, from performers to production team, all passionate about making this project a reality.</p>

<h3>Teatro SEA is Celebrating 35 Years of Success!</h3>
<p>Teatro SEA is a Latino Bilingual Art-in-Education and Theatre Company based in the Lower East Side of New York City, and with offices in Puerto Rico and Florida  This vital organization seeks to empower and advance the latinx community and culture in the United States. </p>
<p>In its 35 year journey, Teatro SEA has performed over 5,000 shows and reached more than one million people. </p>
<p>SEA’s growing repertory encompasses 25 original musical productions, seasonal festivals, plays and educational workshops. Our work is all original - performed simultaneously in English and Spanish, and is rooted in classic fairytales and folktales from acrossLatin America - but put in a new context designed to educate, entertain and provoke discussions in the community about latino culture, immigration and more.   </p>
<p>We are proud to be making a difference in the lives of children and their families, building self-esteem and celebrating heritage and diversity. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>It is a Critical Time for Teatro SEA </h3>
<p>As many arts organizations are being forced to dissolve, we are more passionate than ever about our mission. We are proud to be celebrating our legacy with a special fundraising program to help equip us to continue our work as we set our sights on the next 35 years.  </p>
<p>We are expanding our efforts to include virtual programming, “Libros Teatro - Theatre Books” - a new children's book series, video productions, our new web series and musical project El Avion The Airplane...and more! </p>
<p>Before the pandemic, Teatro SEA employed more than 80 artists, arts-administrators, designers, puppeteers, technicians and teaching-artists. We are working hard to develop strategies so that we can continue to be a vital force of education, enrichment, and employment in the theatrical community.<br/> </p>
<h3>Act Now to Help Ensure we Can continue to Enrich the lives of Children for 35+ years more! </h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $35,000 in celebration of our 35 years of success and to help secure the future of SEA! We invite you to join us, no matter the size of your gift. Whether you give $35, $350, or $3,500 -- please show your pride and support for Teatro SEA by donating today. </p>
<p>Your donation will help to ensure that Teatro SEA can survive beyond the pandemic and give us the boost we need to successfully reinvent our programming while our “real world” theatre is closed.  We have the vision and potential to amplify our programming to a virtual world, creating a resource for education and entertainment that is more far-reaching than we ever imagined.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help!</p>
<p>Please help us to spread the word and share this opportunity with your friends and colleagues! </p>
<p>Together, we can make a difference! </p>

We are proud to be making a difference in the lives of children and their families, building self-esteem and celebrating heritage and diversity. 
 
It is a Critical Time for Teatro SEA 
As many arts organizations are being forced to dissolve, we are more passionate than ever about our mission. We are proud to be celebrating our legacy with a special fundraising program to help equip us to continue our work as we set our sights on the next 35 years.  
We are expanding our efforts to include virtual programming, “Libros Teatro - Theatre Books” - a new children's book series, video productions, our new web series and musical project El Avion The Airplane...and more! 
Before the pandemic, Teatro SEA employed more than 80 artists, arts-administrators, designers, puppeteers, technicians and teaching-artists. We are working hard to develop strategies so that we can continue to be a vital force of education, enrichment, and employment in the theatrical community. 
Act Now to Help Ensure we Can continue to Enrich the lives of Children for 35+ years more! 
Our goal is to raise $35,000 in celebration of our 35 years of success and to help secure the future of SEA! We invite you to join us, no matter the size of your gift. Whether you give $35, $350, or $3,500 -- please show your pride and support for Teatro SEA by donating today. 
Your donation will help to ensure that Teatro SEA can survive beyond the pandemic and give us the boost we need to successfully reinvent our programming while our “real world” theatre is closed.  We have the vision and potential to amplify our programming to a virtual world, creating a resource for education and entertainment that is more far-reaching than we ever imagined.

There she worked with choreographers Netta Yerushalmy, Kyle Abraham, Nick Bruder, LeeSaar the Company, Shen Wei Dance Arts, Pam Tanowitz Dance, Randy James, John Evans, Julia Ritter, and Keith A. Thompson. She was also a Bates Dance Festival scholarship recipient. In the summer of 2014 Stacy was given the opportunity to travel to Istanbul, Turkey to work with choreographer Julia Ritter and director Ayrin Ersoz on an immersive dance theatre project, Frozen Dream. Stacy Collado has shown her own choreography in various venues in New York City and continues to explore dance-making. She is interested in the merging of art forms and collaboration, including music, visual art, theatre, and film. Her process works with the ideas of manipulating shape and color, and she works with her dancers to create a variety of landscapes. While maintaining a subtly ridiculous or satirical nature, Stacy is also aesthetically interested in challenging physical habits in human nature and then putting them into performance-art perspective using gesture and the functionality of the human body. Pedestrian notions and ideas are inherent and integral in the developing of her work; she is interested in creating awkward, quirky and visceral realities that might be disconnected, that contain moments in which things might be glimpsed at and abandoned, and that glorifies pedestrian nature to its very strange core. </p><p>KAT J.

Her own work has been shown throughout Pennsylvania, New York, and North Carolina, notably in the Ruby Slipper Fringe Festival (NC), Triskelion’s Comedy in Dance Festival (NYC), and Koresh’s Come Together Festival (PHL).

Upon receiving her BFA in dance, Hillary has danced with Company Stefanie Batten Bland, Robert Mark Dance and Antonia &amp; Artists. Hillary continues to choreograph through exploring the medium of film, in collaboration with other artists. Choreographically, Hillary’s aesthetic is to create movement as form, engaging with physical sensations through the interplay of various elements: repetition, momentum, relationships with the floor, and periphery. The significance of pushing the physical body and the cognitive self beyond the conventional compels her to explore movement through a lens of reverberating possibilities.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We're Rosa and Annie, and we're making an experimental puppet show.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Above everything we want our show to tackle pressing issues relating to the environment in an innovative and arresting way. It's important that as humans we have these conversations again and again, in a million different ways, so that it sticks in our brains and we can save the planet... before it's too late.</p>
<p>Our show is specifically for families and will be suitable for children ages 7 and up. In the piece we'll address 5 problems: the great pacific garbage patch, micro plastics, oil, dead zones and climate change in the deep ocean. We'll talk briefly about solutions too, but the main idea is to introduce these concepts and inspire conversation within families.</p>

<p>Space, (build and rehearsal space for 3 months, Jan 2017-Mar 2017) £800</p>
<p>Materials, (materials will mostly be free!) £300</p>
<p>Transport (hiring a van to move our piece to venues) £100</p>
<p>We are making a range of goodies and prizes for people who contribute to the show! Everything is handmade with love, from illustrated cards, to screen printed goods, to jewellery.</p>

<h3>Other Ways To Get Involved.</h3>
<p>One of the biggest way to get involved is by collecting. We're looking for all types of plastic packaging (it's best if it's one solid colour.), plastic bags, straws, aluminium cans, and anything else that you think is worth saving. We trust your magpie instincts!</p>
<p>We can easily collect materials from anywhere in Sheffield, London, Brighton or Norwich, if you're not in one of those places, drop us an email anyway and we'll try and work it out!</p>

He also holds a degree in music from Cardiff University.Musical Director Owen McCarthy has also worked on a number of musicals before, including Dracula Spectacular, Grease, High School Musical, Oliver, and Annie, as well as taking rehearsals with the Pendyrus male voice choir.Production Manager Henri Page is also a seasoned amateur dramatic, and is currently the treasurer for Cardiff University's theatre society, Act One. Risks & ChallengesProducing a theatrical show is tricky business, and is not without its challenges. Now that we have entered formal rehearsals, the production team need to co-ordinate the efforts of over 40 individuals - cast, crew, band and others- in order to make the show a success. This will require meticulous planning of every aspect, from devising a marketing strategy, to building and designing the set. However, firm financial backing and advance planning will provide us with the best footing from which to launch our project. Other Ways You Can HelpWe would be incredibly thankful if you would do all you can to help spread the word about this campaign and to generate further interest.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">„Viele Grüße, Michael Kohlhaas!“ was written 1977 by the German-Romanian author Frieder Schuller after the novella by Heinrich von Kleist and prohibited 1978 by the communist Romania. The play has never been shown on stage as Schuller was expelled out of the country immediately after the first rehearsals. He escaped to Germany shortly after the incidents, the play however has since been forgotten. </span></p>
</div><div>
<p>Borders - Cutting point of personal and collective missunderstandings. Up to date in 19th century of Kleist, as well as in communist Romania 1978 we still find ourselves today confronted by many borders and demarcations. With the original manuscript in our hands we want to make the first step to bring Schullers play out of the oblivion to its world premiere! </p>
<p>As Austrian artists our main performance takes place in Vienna. But due to the actual political situation it's the right time to take the drama play over the border to London! With setting up an premiere in the UK we want to give an impulse to overthink as many borders, limitations and demarcations as possible.</p>
<p>For that we cross our own borders as far as possible, but (un)fortunately we can't do this only by our own. Money is once again the biggest border for so many artists. Let's cross it together and set up the world premiere of 'Viele Gruesse, Michael Kohlhaas!'in EUs recently lost city!</p>

<p>We are a group of Austrian freelance artists and actors got together to produce, create and perform the prohibited and forgotten 'Viele Gruesse, Michael Kohlhaas!' and not at least to tell the story about Frieder Schuller and his eviction from communist Romania as an example of many citizens being demarcated and expelled from their home country. With support of the author himself initiator and lead actor Florian Reichl set up a 20-headed team to cross the borders with them, including the heart and soul of the production the director Emel Heinreich.</p>

<p>He refuses to take his horses back and claims for their primarily state of health. His following lawsuit goes through all levels of jurisdiction.

<p>He sells all his belongings and trains his farmhands to fight back. The small rout receives a lot of popularity among the population and grows quickly to a serious threat for the whole country. Kohlhaas has to realize: The whole situation has nothing to do with justice anymore... </p>

<p>The play about the ancient German character Michael Kohlhaas questions borders, the necessity of passports and the conflicts between a self empowering individual and the authorities. What remains in the end are many questions: </p>
<p>How far should self empowerment go? What's righteous and how far do we go to be right after all? Why do we sometimes fail to forgive someone else and what can we do not to always fight against each other?</p>
<p>Repeating itself, the story of Michael Kohlhaas and Frieder Schuller are just representations of many borders been drawn, citizens been expelled and battles been fought over disagreements, misunderstandings and oppositions. </p>

<p>We have a big goal in mind: Crossing borders instead of drawing them. Connecting, uniting and loosing our own borders. Boundlessness and the freedom to travel within Europe seems due to the actual political situation no more as a matter of course, least of all it isn't for a lot of people all around the world.</p>
<p>Performing in London would be a great opportunity for us all! As human beings we all do automatically set up borders, personal ones as well as national demarcations at a bigger scale. Let's just overthink them and make a statement with a set up show in London.</p>
<p>For us, money (un)fortunately gets a limitation at some point. Setting up an international dama play can be expensive. Every cent contributed to us is going straight to our play and hard working artists. Flights, logistics, housing and regular meals during the rehearsals and performances require a higher budget than performing in our home town in Austria. We don't have that many needs, but that doesn't mean we have no needs at all :)</p>
<p>With your help the world premiere of 'Viele Gruesse, Michael Kohlhaas!' is nearly within reach! If we gain at least the sum of 10.000€ the remaining costs for the show will finally be covered and the performance is going to take place at the awesome St. Michael's Church in Camden Town, London. But every cent counts and if we are not able to reach the goal nothing is lost at all. We'll put the money straight into our show in Austria and safe it to bring 'Viele Gruesse, Michael Kohlaas!' to places where the political statement can inspire people to overthink personal and national borders, for example to Frieder Schullers homecountry Romania.</p>
<p>We are thankful for every help we get. And for us, helping means more likely doing it together! We cross our borders to make it possible, let's cross them together!</p>

<p>Money pays the bills, even though money is not everything! Without a lot of people supporting us, 'Viele Grüße, Michael Kohlhaas!' wouldn't be possible. Just share the project and our crowdfunding campaign with others! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A BIG HUGE THANK YOU just for everyone helping us and creating this awesome possibility with us!</p>

As he returns to clarify the illegitimate situation he finds his horses collapsing and near death under immense fieldwork. He feels betrayed. 
He refuses to take his horses back and claims for their primarily state of health. His following lawsuit goes through all levels of jurisdiction. Michael looses permanentely and is getting nothing out of it but scorn and derision. When finally his wife gets deadly injured by one of the earl's watchmen, it‘s enough! 
He sells all his belongings and trains his farmhands to fight back. The small rout receives a lot of popularity among the population and grows quickly to a serious threat for the whole country. Kohlhaas has to realize: The whole situation has nothing to do with justice anymore... 



The play about the ancient German character Michael Kohlhaas questions borders, the necessity of passports and the conflicts between a self empowering individual and the authorities. What remains in the end are many questions: 
How far should self empowerment go? What's righteous and how far do we go to be right after all? Why do we sometimes fail to forgive someone else and what can we do not to always fight against each other?
Repeating itself, the story of Michael Kohlhaas and Frieder Schuller are just representations of many borders been drawn, citizens been expelled and battles been fought over disagreements, misunderstandings and oppositions. 




We have a big goal in mind: Crossing borders instead of drawing them. Connecting, uniting and loosing our own borders. Boundlessness and the freedom to travel within Europe seems due to the actual political situation no more as a matter of course, least of all it isn't for a lot of people all around the world.
Performing in London would be a great opportunity for us all! As human beings we all do automatically set up borders, personal ones as well as national demarcations at a bigger scale. Let's just overthink them and make a statement with a set up show in London.
For us, money (un)fortunately gets a limitation at some point. Setting up an international dama play can be expensive. Every cent contributed to us is going straight to our play and hard working artists. Flights, logistics, housing and regular meals during the rehearsals and performances require a higher budget than performing in our home town in Austria. We don't have that many needs, but that doesn't mean we have no needs at all :)
With your help the world premiere of 'Viele Gruesse, Michael Kohlhaas!' is nearly within reach! If we gain at least the sum of 10.000€ the remaining costs for the show will finally be covered and the performance is going to take place at the awesome St. Michael's Church in Camden Town, London. But every cent counts and if we are not able to reach the goal nothing is lost at all. We'll put the money straight into our show in Austria and safe it to bring 'Viele Gruesse, Michael Kohlaas!' to places where the political statement can inspire people to overthink personal and national borders, for example to Frieder Schullers homecountry Romania.
We are thankful for every help we get. And for us, helping means more likely doing it together! We cross our borders to make it possible, let's cross them together!


Money pays the bills, even though money is not everything! Without a lot of people supporting us, 'Viele Grüße, Michael Kohlhaas!' wouldn't be possible. Just share the project and our crowdfunding campaign with others! 

A BIG HUGE THANK YOU just for everyone helping us and creating this awesome possibility with us!

'Viele Gruesse, Michael Kohlhaas!' tells the story about authorities establishing rules, orders and restrictions over their citizens, sometimes arbitrary ones. As priviledged people we have a lot of possibilities, even when we can't see them at first glance. For many other people borders have a large impact on their lifes and often their survival. With our performance we also arbitrarily divide the spectators area into two parties: A VIP section and an area for ordinary people.

By combining our shared research and interest in a number of different theatrical practices we hope to create an exciting and innovative piece of theatre together.</p>
<p>We are importantly an EU company with performers from the UK, France, Czech republic, Poland and Estonia. We and our generation believe in the unity of our countries and strongly believe that we can stay united through our creative connection. Which is key in these uncertain times.</p>

<h3>I Need Your Help! </h3>
<p>I've got a month to nail down the logistics of getting my work onstage. This will be my first play to have a run off-Broadway. It is a dream come true. And also a very short timeline. And you can play a huge role in making this a reality!</p>
<ul>
<li>Donations go towards everyone involved (actors, stage management, etc.) for their work, travel, food, and accommodations, and will also go towards production costs, including props and costumes.</li>
<li>The show will run on <strong>December 9th (at 9 pm) and December 10th (at 3 pm) </strong>at <strong>Manhattan Repertory Theatre </strong>(17 W 45th St)</li>
<li>If this off-Broadway run succeeds, Garbage Person Karaoke plans to head to the DC Fringe Festival in 2017. Donors of a certain level will receive free tickets to a performance!</li>
<li>Any gift, even a dollar, will help this passion project come to life in messy, fiery, hilarious ways. I can't believe this is taking off so suddenly. You will literally help a dream come true, and I won't be able to thank you enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like karaoke, getting this show on the road will be scary, exhilarating, and (probably) enjoyable while hammered. What do you have to lose!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help!</h3>

I've got a month to nail down the logistics of getting my work onstage. This will be my first play to have a run off-Broadway. It is a dream come true. And also a very short timeline. And you can play a huge role in making this a reality!

Donations go towards everyone involved (actors, stage management, etc.) for their work, travel, food, and accommodations, and will also go towards production costs, including props and costumes.
The show will run on December 9th (at 9 pm) and December 10th (at 3 pm) at Manhattan Repertory Theatre (17 W 45th St)
If this off-Broadway run succeeds, Garbage Person Karaoke plans to head to the DC Fringe Festival in 2017. Donors of a certain level will receive free tickets to a performance!
Any gift, even a dollar, will help this passion project come to life in messy, fiery, hilarious ways. I can't believe this is taking off so suddenly. You will literally help a dream come true, and I won't be able to thank you enough.

Just like karaoke, getting this show on the road will be scary, exhilarating, and (probably) enjoyable while hammered. What do you have to lose!

(non-porofit organization)Founded by V.Ruban and team of involved enthusiasts in 2014, Kiev, Ukraine.  It is the first non-profit dance-production company with a complex approach that specialized in performing arts and contemporary dance. It was found and works for fostering developement and promotion of contemporary dance and performing arts in Ukraine, as well with ukrainian emerging artists globally (in international interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary projects).Since the beginning this evolving initiative is worked and supported by enthusiasts from choreography, institutors, performers, light-designers, support by video-production company, sound-designers, graphic-designers, lawyer, finance-consultants, culture activists, managers etc. About the show (performance)#LetMePleaseYou is an ambitious and one of the largest contemporary dance-productions in Ukraine involving remarkable artists (dance, dance-dramaturgy, performance video-mapping, sound-design and graphic-design) from Ukraine and Lithuania. It will be provocative and extremely specific. In terms of the content it is already rich and complex as it concerns the core of human lifes.Impressions from creators:“Monika: What I really liked when working with Viktor and Danil was that they did everything with their own hands. We start all of our work by bringing our own linoleum, laying it out and cleaning the floor. These are the ethics behind their creative work and their perspective. They don’t wait for anything, they go for it and they care”  to check full text: article“V.Ruban: While going deeper with this piece, I see that Soviet builders did a big job in faking the Real. Imposed fake ""normal""  family, fake ""normal"" hapiness, ""normal"" career, social guaranties and safety if you are well behaving. We 've started from us, we look for soviet things we share  and we deal with them. The project evolves like revealing itself. It's a great opportunity to be part of the process of the society.Getting to the more pragmatic things - this process of society takes time and  resources to get from intention, idea, inspiration to material shape and has material dimention. The budget of this production looks massive but few facts and figures to know what we need those money for:production of this piece started in february 2016 and will end in oktober 2016 (9 month); the project team is 19 people that is linked with production during all the period; to be factual total budget of production is 38400$ and consists of costs for logistics (6 810$); technical part (6 090$): at least minimal fee for each involved (14 175$, for all 9 months) and administrative costs (11 340$)We have benefited support from Lithuanian Culture Institute for at least the part of costs for logistics; I've put all I head from myself too we got already few direct donations indeed. We have great help from hosting us institutions not paying the rent for our stay, work and presentations, some partners giving us hand for free with moments in process but it's still far away from having enough resources to produce the piece.In Ukraine we still don’t have any institutional financial support and funding for contemporary art. So this fund-raising campaign is the only way to gather resourses to make this production happen. We would be very greatful for each coin that you may drop in our potluck.""  Want to see it live?schedule of passed events:Audition 1 (Kiev, Dovjenko National Center) – confirmed – 15-17th of April 2016Audition 2 (Kiev, Dovjenko National Center) – confirmed – 20-22nd of May 2016Residency 1 (Pidghorodtsi, Lviv region, Carpathians) – confirmed – 19-27th of June 2016schedule of upcoming events:Residency 2 and 3 (Kiev, Dovjenko National Center) – confirmed – 17-31st of July 2016Pre-premiere Residency (Nida,Lithuania, CTIC ""Agila"") – confirmed –15-25th of September 2016Premiere (Kiev, ̈House of Officers) – not confirmed – 6-9th of Oktober 2016 Our ways of saying “thanks”!We welcome contributions of any size – big or small, every gift will bring us closer to achieving our goal.  For a gift $25 or more you have the option to receive one of the special perks listed on this page – from personalized shout-outs to exclusive packages that include merch, photos, signed scripts, a personalized video thank-you, an invitation to a studio rehearsal, and even Skype chats with the creators! To the most generous contributors there will be also a special perk - personal, 3 days special tour, in Ukraine to experience the premiere in Kiev almost as a part of the team. Other Ways You Can HelpSHARESpreading the word is another valuable way you can help us.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Fasmode or Fasa Modern, we are a student run dance team on the Cal State Northridge campus. Being a student run team comes with many complications such as needing to get funding on our own. We are an extremely passionate group of young dancers who are trying to progress and make a change in the dance community while supporting dancers to grow and succeed. We're more than just a dance team, we're a family and we offer a safe and free environment for students to express themselves and have the support they need while going through their college career.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise about $10,000 so that our students don't have to worry about one more college fee. Any money goes a long way and will help our team greatly. The $10,000 will go towards getting costumes, paying for competitions (including transportation and hotel), being able to put on our charity showcase and for any equipment we may need for our dancers to succeed. Depending on your donation amount, you will receive gifts from the team (as stated on the perks page).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The dance community is one of the fastest growing artistic communities out there. The reason why it's so big is because it offers people of all ages to put their time and energy into something positive. Specifically on a college campuses there's a rising problem in stress and mental illnesses in students. As a dance team we want to be able to create a stress free environment for our students and way for them to ""let loose"" in a productive manner. We also want to help students in growing as not only dancers, but as leaders as they continue on in their college careers. Instilling confidence and self worth are at the basis of our goals. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our challenges reside in the fact that we are a student-run dance team and we don't want our students to have to pay too much. That being said, without the right funds, we cannot function successfully as a dance team because we won't have the means to. Fundraising money is extremely important to us because then that takes one less stressor off of our members. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are plenty of ways that you can help our team. Helping out with costumes and gear, or donating any dance equipment you may have. Any social connections within the dance community helps a ton. Having a space where we can have practices if our locations ever fall through, or even a possible partnership/sponsorship is greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>This is our biggest and most ambitious project to date. Our biggest venue, our biggest set, and the biggest amount of budgeting we've ever had to do.  We're confident that we can raise the money in a variety of ways. And a little bit scared too.</p>
<p>But as Babe Ruth wisely said, ""Never let the fear of striking out get in your way.""</p>
<p>If we don't meet our goal, the show will go on.  The main reason we are asking for the funds is to make this show THE BEST IT CAN BE. One of the worst feelings is seeing a good idea executed badly, so the closer we get to our overall fundraising target, the more we can focus on the quality of the show.</p>
<p>We are asking for $2,500 to make this dream a reality.  That may seem like a lot, but it's only 25% of the total production cost. Musicals are expensive to produce, and this one is no exception. There are costs we have never encountered before: larger space comes with a larger rental fee, costuming a 14-person cast, body microphones, a music director, a band, extra lighting and sound equipment, and so so so much fake blood. </p>
<p>""What do I get in return?"" you might be saying to yourself.  We know that's a lot of money to ask for, and we have varying levels of rewards for your contributions ranging from feel good bragging rights, limited edition Cannibal! The Musical memorabilia, and even a spot on our production team as Executive Producer.</p>

This is our biggest and most ambitious project to date. Our biggest venue, our biggest set, and the biggest amount of budgeting we've ever had to do.  We're confident that we can raise the money in a variety of ways. And a little bit scared too.
But as Babe Ruth wisely said, ""Never let the fear of striking out get in your way.""
If we don't meet our goal, the show will go on.  The main reason we are asking for the funds is to make this show THE BEST IT CAN BE. One of the worst feelings is seeing a good idea executed badly, so the closer we get to our overall fundraising target, the more we can focus on the quality of the show.
We are asking for $2,500 to make this dream a reality.  That may seem like a lot, but it's only 25% of the total production cost. Musicals are expensive to produce, and this one is no exception. There are costs we have never encountered before: larger space comes with a larger rental fee, costuming a 14-person cast, body microphones, a music director, a band, extra lighting and sound equipment, and so so so much fake blood. 
""What do I get in return?"" you might be saying to yourself.  We know that's a lot of money to ask for, and we have varying levels of rewards for your contributions ranging from feel good bragging rights, limited edition Cannibal! The Musical memorabilia, and even a spot on our production team as Executive Producer.

Are you a local business? We are also offering Sponsorship packages!  Email Devin DiMattia at devindimattia@gmail.com for more information on our different sponsorship levels.
Can’t financially contribute?  That’s ok!  Does our story resonate with you?  Great!  Help us get the word out and share our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and that family group chat that’s blowing up your phone.
If you can contribute to our campaign, thank you.  We are so excited about this leap we are making. It's a thrilling and daunting leap, and we know we can do it with your help. 

We are performing at the Hannah Block Historic USO Community Arts Center. 120 S 2nd St, Wilmington, North Carolina 28401
Show dates are October 4th - October 21st.  For more information on tickets, show dates and times, visit our website at www.PSLcomedy.com",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><br/><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>I’m happy to announce that we received a grant from the US Embassy in Lisbon and will be returning to The Azores in April of 2020!  I’ll be teaching workshops to the youth for a week followed by a performance of <i>Half-Heard</i> with my amazing company, Rocha Dance Theater! The grant covers our travel and accommodations, but we are still in need of raising funds for all the artist fees. Donate now and help support this incredible project and cultural exchange!</p>
<p><strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong></p>
<p>Hello! I’m Jenny Rocha, choreographer and founder of Rocha Dance Theater. I’m also a performer, costume designer and teaching artist based in Brooklyn, NY. For my current repertoire, <i>Half-Heard</i>, I’m working with company members:  Alex Bittner, Dervla Carey-Jones, Courtney Drasner, Nikki Ervice, Jamie Graham, Nicole Lemelin, as well as composer and husband, Joseph Rivas.</p>
<p>We have all been involved in the creative process for <i>Half-Heard</i> since 2018. Last February, the work was presented and funded, in part, by The CUNY Dance Initiative in partnership with John Jay College/Gerald W. Lynch Theater. <i>Half-Heard</i> premiered to a full house and rave reviews! However, we only got to perform this important work for one night. I knew we needed to share the piece with more audiences and that the performers deserved more opportunities to showcase their hard work, talent and voices.</p>
<p>So I got to work. I received a commission from Roger Williams University to teach, set a work on their students and then perform Half-Heard with RDT. This was part of their Alive Arts Series this past Feb 8th 2020. I also had applied for an Innovation Grant by the US Embassy to teach youth followed by a performance of the piece in The Azores...and got it!</p>
<p><strong>IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>We believe <i>Half-Heard</i> is relevant, relatable and important. The message asks for social change for women in the workplace and beyond. Through imagery and parody, the work is a commentary about equity in the workplace, eliminating micro-aggressions and breaking down stereotypes and gender constructs.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK</strong></p>
<p>Integrating dance, theatrical parody and architectural costume design, <i>Half-Heard</i> shows a satirized version of a woman’s struggle to be heard in the workplace. An all-female identifying -- and at times, drag cast -- opens a veritable Pandora's box of the absurdity of gender roles and human behavior.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE WE DOING THERE?</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Half-Heard:</i></strong><strong> The Azores Performance &amp; Workshop Series</strong></p>
<p>Rocha Dance Theater will be returning to Sao Miguel, Azores this April. As you may know, my family is from Sao Miguel and I have been developing an artist relationship with the community since RDT’s first Azores residency back in 2018. With the support of a new grant from the US Embassy in Lisbon, I will lead a 5 day workshop for students ages 12-20, teaching repertory and technique. At the end of the week, my company will perform <i>Half-Heard</i> at a local theater called Teatro Ribeiragrandense. The young people will have the opportunity to perform the culminated piece as part of our show, which is free to the community.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE WE ASKING?</strong></p>
<p>Crowdfunding, private donors and fans like you help small dance companies continue to make great work. We hope that you will consider a donation towards RDT’s return to the Azores! We have a large group of 8 people this time so we need some help covering the remainder of the fees. The grant from The US Embassy in Lisbon covers airfare and local transportation. The remaining funds that we need to raise are for all artist fees. In order to reach the minimum budget, we will need to raise an additional $6000. This amount will cover a flat fee for each company member. The company will rehearse in NYC for a two week period and then travel abroad for 4 days where they will participate in tech, dress rehearsals and the performance.</p>
<p><strong>Would you consider supporting <i>Half-Heard:</i> The Azores Performance &amp; Workshop Series by making a contribution?</strong> Your support is greatly appreciated and will be used to cultivate a cultural exchange in dance! If you cannot make a donation, can you help spread the word/share the campaign?</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>We made our goal! Now what?</h2><p>We are so grateful to have made our goal! You may be wondering if we still need donations. The answer is YES! The goal we set was geared towards paying for all of the things we mention below, mostly the artists and the space. Additional funds will be used for: </p><ul>
<li>Paying the two creative team members who are currently working as volunteers.</li>
<li>Getting the show out to the world! We are filming Sunday's production and will need funds to edit the material in order to market the show to other venues. </li>
<li>Future productions! Any other funds will be put towards the expenses for remounting the show in other venues, and/or making new work. </li>
</ul><p>Thank you all again for your support. Last night's audience was such a thrill. We are so glad to be back in the theatre and sharing this story!</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Short Summary</strong></h2><p>Are you ready for adventure? Join Hero, our clown-like protagonist, as she is called on a hero's journey by her phone. Meet Harry Potter Doll (HPD), E-william Shakespeare (ES), and other characters in this highly theatrical show using puppets, physical theatre, and exposed theatricality to explore grief through play, with plenty of comedy, a puppet co-star (Harry Potter Doll), and music inspired by 80s fantasy. </p><p> </p><h3>Team</h3><p>Emily Zempel Roberts began to write this show in 2020. To make it a reality she joined up with an amazing team, mainly comprised of women and mothers. Some of us are working to create our first projects after parenthood, while attempting to establish a new way of working that can support theatrical artists that are also primary care givers. By focusing on a woman-led production we are also able to create new cultures of working, new perspectives, and a compassionate theatrical environment. </p><p><strong>Emily Zempel Roberts: </strong>Emily is a constantly curious actor who seeks to challenge trends of realism in theatre. A professional actor for many years, her love of text and voice work gives her a strong inclination to perform Shakespeare, and her need for movement exploration has made her second love devised work. She is a performer, a PhD student at the Shakespeare Institute, and a lecturer in theatre performance. This is her first solo performance, and her first fully realized script. </p><p><strong>Elizabeth Audley</strong>: Elizabeth has worked in professional theater for over 25 years as an actor, director, producer, writer, and teacher, and has a special interest in new and devised work. She recently directed the first workshops and readings of Persuasion, a new adaptation of the Jane Austen novel by Sarah Rose Kearns, which is currently being produced by Bedlam Theater, off-Broadway.  She has a BA from Brown University, and her MFA from Ohio University, with additional training from SITI Company, Pig Iron Theater, The Actor’s Studio, Fiasco Theater, The Alvin Ailey Center, LaMama, and The American Globe. She lives and works in Beacon, NY.</p><p><b>Emily Dykeman: </b>Emily is a devised theatre artist and writer based in New York. She graduated from SUNY Orange in 2010 and Cedarville University in 2012, studying English and Theater. She co-founded Dykeman Donovan Theater Lab in 2015, producing and acting in “Requiem,” which earned a grant from the Orange County Arts Council in 2016, and “The Bear,” which was featured in the Newburgh Illuminated Festival in 2017. She has worked with the Hudson Valley Performing Arts Laboratory since 2018--wearing many hats, including grant-writer, performer, lighting designer, and script writer.</p><p><b>Sarah Byrons: </b>Sarah is a New York-based theatre artist and graduate from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where she earned her BFA in Theatre, with a focus on acting and playwriting. During her time at NYU, Sarah studied with Playwrights Horizons Theatre School, developing a strong background in the creation of new and devised work, and has studied playwriting in both New York and London. Sarah also studied with The Classical Studio, training extensively in Shakespearean verse and performance. Currently, Sarah co-runs and serves as the Creative Producer for the Hudson Valley Performing Arts Laboratory, a company based in Poughkeepsie, New York, that provides accessible opportunities to engage with the performing arts through affordable educational programming and the creation of new and ensemble-based work. She is a proud member of the Dramatists Guild.</p><p><b>Jonathon Roberts: </b>Jonathon is a composer, audio engineer, and sound designer. He is on staff at Gimlet/Spotify where he has worked on scripted podcasts The Two Princes, Motherhacker, Chompers, Story Pirates, and The Final Chapters of Richard Brown Winters. Previously he founded the arts nonprofit Spark+Echo Arts with his wife Emily Clare Zempel, wrote music for slot machines, and toured the US with a one-person show on the Apostle Paul.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2><h3>Our Budget</h3><p>We received a grant from Arts Mid-Hudson for $1,500, which helped us to get started with rehearsals and production. Our two major expenses are people and space.</p><p>Space: We have some donated space, which offsets our cost. For the rest of rehearsal and production, we need $1,600. </p><p>People: We are dedicated to helping everyone receive fair wages for this project. For that to happen we need $5,000.</p><p>Set, props, and costumes are simple, for a total of $700.</p><p>For marketing and design we need $400. </p><p>Finally, we would like to have $500 for contingencies and emergencies.</p><p>The total budget is $7,900. We have already received $1500 from Arts Mid-Hudson to create the show, and expect $900 in ticket sales.</p><p>That leaves a deficit of $5,500 to be funded with your help!</p><p> </p><h3>Perks</h3><p>$10–Your name will be listed on our website as a supporter.</p><p>$20–Your name will be listed on our website, and we will give you a shout out on social media.</p><p>$35–All of the above. In addition, if you send us a pic, we will memify you with a big ol' clown nose on your schnoz!</p><p>$50–All of the above, plus a sneak peak of the script for the play. </p><p>$100–Your name in the program, on our website, and on social media as a sponsor (Threshold Crosser), and two tickets to the show as available OR special access to attend the dress rehearsal live or via zoom. </p><p>$250–Your name in program, on our website, and on social media as a producer (Helper), two tickets to the show (or dress), and access to a short video created by Emily Zempel Roberts with some simple tips on how to create a few moments of physical theatre from the show.</p><p>$500–Your name in program, on our website, and on social media as a patron (Mentor). Two tickets to the show (or dress). In addition HPD (my Harry Potter Doll puppet) will send you a special message of your choice!</p><p>$1,000–Your name in program, on our website, and on social media as a Hero.  Two tickets to the show (or virtual dress). In addition you may attend one live rehearsal (in person if vaccinated and masked, or via zoom), followed by a question and answer session with the creative team.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2><p>We are all in an extended period of grieving. The content of our play is based on a loss Emily Zempel Roberts experienced in 2019 and her continued grieving during the pandemic. The hero’s journey framework comes from her own grief experience: she found that she wanted her loss to have a greater purpose–to be a part of some hero’s journey to which she was called.</p><p>The chosen style of this production allows for that exploration of grief and loss with laughter and play, rather than unadorned tragedy. The naivete of Hero as a type of theatrical clown will give her the innocence to come to understanding slowly, while sharing her experience with the audience. The depth of loss will be felt not through her tears, but through the form of the work—the dissolution of the fantasy at the end of the play. </p><p>We believe the themes of this piece will help the community to filter their own pandemic-based grief through a work that makes them laugh and hopefully feel a bit less alone. </p><p> </p><h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The pandemic creates some risks for us. We have several plans in place in the event that it is no longer safe to perform inside. First, we will require audience members to be masked and</span><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to have proof of vaccination. If that is not sufficient, we will either move the play outside, or record </span>the<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> performance for streaming, hopefully with the </span>opportunity to mount it live in the spring. Either way, the show will go on, as safely as possible. </font></p><p> </p><h2><strong>Performance Details</strong></h2><p>A Hero's Journey will be performed October 22-24 at 7:30pm at the Beacon Performing Arts Center on Main Street in Beacon, NY.</p><p>Tickets are available here; <a href=""https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/5237804"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/5237804 </a></p><p>**All audience members must show proof of vaccination and wear a mask during the performance.

You may be wondering if we still need donations. The answer is YES! The goal we set was geared towards paying for all of the things we mention below, mostly the artists and the space. Additional funds will be used for: 
Paying the two creative team members who are currently working as volunteers.
Getting the show out to the world! We are filming Sunday's production and will need funds to edit the material in order to market the show to other venues. 
Future productions! Any other funds will be put towards the expenses for remounting the show in other venues, and/or making new work. 
Thank you all again for your support. Last night's audience was such a thrill. We are so glad to be back in the theatre and sharing this story! Short SummaryAre you ready for adventure? Join Hero, our clown-like protagonist, as she is called on a hero's journey by her phone. Meet Harry Potter Doll (HPD), E-william Shakespeare (ES), and other characters in this highly theatrical show using puppets, physical theatre, and exposed theatricality to explore grief through play, with plenty of comedy, a puppet co-star (Harry Potter Doll), and music inspired by 80s fantasy.  TeamEmily Zempel Roberts began to write this show in 2020. To make it a reality she joined up with an amazing team, mainly comprised of women and mothers. Some of us are working to create our first projects after parenthood, while attempting to establish a new way of working that can support theatrical artists that are also primary care givers. By focusing on a woman-led production we are also able to create new cultures of working, new perspectives, and a compassionate theatrical environment. Emily Zempel Roberts: Emily is a constantly curious actor who seeks to challenge trends of realism in theatre. A professional actor for many years, her love of text and voice work gives her a strong inclination to perform Shakespeare, and her need for movement exploration has made her second love devised work. She is a performer, a PhD student at the Shakespeare Institute, and a lecturer in theatre performance. This is her first solo performance, and her first fully realized script. Elizabeth Audley: Elizabeth has worked in professional theater for over 25 years as an actor, director, producer, writer, and teacher, and has a special interest in new and devised work. She recently directed the first workshops and readings of Persuasion, a new adaptation of the Jane Austen novel by Sarah Rose Kearns, which is currently being produced by Bedlam Theater, off-Broadway.  She has a BA from Brown University, and her MFA from Ohio University, with additional training from SITI Company, Pig Iron Theater, The Actor’s Studio, Fiasco Theater, The Alvin Ailey Center, LaMama, and The American Globe. She lives and works in Beacon, NY.Emily Dykeman: Emily is a devised theatre artist and writer based in New York. She graduated from SUNY Orange in 2010 and Cedarville University in 2012, studying English and Theater. She co-founded Dykeman Donovan Theater Lab in 2015, producing and acting in “Requiem,” which earned a grant from the Orange County Arts Council in 2016, and “The Bear,” which was featured in the Newburgh Illuminated Festival in 2017. She has worked with the Hudson Valley Performing Arts Laboratory since 2018--wearing many hats, including grant-writer, performer, lighting designer, and script writer.Sarah Byrons: Sarah is a New York-based theatre artist and graduate from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where she earned her BFA in Theatre, with a focus on acting and playwriting. During her time at NYU, Sarah studied with Playwrights Horizons Theatre School, developing a strong background in the creation of new and devised work, and has studied playwriting in both New York and London. Sarah also studied with The Classical Studio, training extensively in Shakespearean verse and performance. Currently, Sarah co-runs and serves as the Creative Producer for the Hudson Valley Performing Arts Laboratory, a company based in Poughkeepsie, New York, that provides accessible opportunities to engage with the performing arts through affordable educational programming and the creation of new and ensemble-based work. She is a proud member of the Dramatists Guild.Jonathon Roberts: Jonathon is a composer, audio engineer, and sound designer. He is on staff at Gimlet/Spotify where he has worked on scripted podcasts The Two Princes, Motherhacker, Chompers, Story Pirates, and The Final Chapters of Richard Brown Winters. Previously he founded the arts nonprofit Spark+Echo Arts with his wife Emily Clare Zempel, wrote music for slot machines, and toured the US with a one-person show on the Apostle Paul. What We Need & What You GetOur BudgetWe received a grant from Arts Mid-Hudson for $1,500, which helped us to get started with rehearsals and production. Our two major expenses are people and space.Space: We have some donated space, which offsets our cost. For the rest of rehearsal and production, we need $1,600. People: We are dedicated to helping everyone receive fair wages for this project. For that to happen we need $5,000.Set, props, and costumes are simple, for a total of $700.For marketing and design we need $400. Finally, we would like to have $500 for contingencies and emergencies.The total budget is $7,900. We have already received $1500 from Arts Mid-Hudson to create the show, and expect $900 in ticket sales.That leaves a deficit of $5,500 to be funded with your help! Perks$10–Your name will be listed on our website as a supporter.$20–Your name will be listed on our website, and we will give you a shout out on social media.$35–All of the above. In addition, if you send us a pic, we will memify you with a big ol' clown nose on your schnoz!$50–All of the above, plus a sneak peak of the script for the play. $100–Your name in the program, on our website, and on social media as a sponsor (Threshold Crosser), and two tickets to the show as available OR special access to attend the dress rehearsal live or via zoom. $250–Your name in program, on our website, and on social media as a producer (Helper), two tickets to the show (or dress), and access to a short video created by Emily Zempel Roberts with some simple tips on how to create a few moments of physical theatre from the show.$500–Your name in program, on our website, and on social media as a patron (Mentor). Two tickets to the show (or dress). In addition HPD (my Harry Potter Doll puppet) will send you a special message of your choice!$1,000–Your name in program, on our website, and on social media as a Hero.  Two tickets to the show (or virtual dress). In addition you may attend one live rehearsal (in person if vaccinated and masked, or via zoom), followed by a question and answer session with the creative team. The ImpactWe are all in an extended period of grieving. The content of our play is based on a loss Emily Zempel Roberts experienced in 2019 and her continued grieving during the pandemic. The hero’s journey framework comes from her own grief experience: she found that she wanted her loss to have a greater purpose–to be a part of some hero’s journey to which she was called.The chosen style of this production allows for that exploration of grief and loss with laughter and play, rather than unadorned tragedy. The naivete of Hero as a type of theatrical clown will give her the innocence to come to understanding slowly, while sharing her experience with the audience. The depth of loss will be felt not through her tears, but through the form of the work—the dissolution of the fantasy at the end of the play. We believe the themes of this piece will help the community to filter their own pandemic-based grief through a work that makes them laugh and hopefully feel a bit less alone.  Risks & ChallengesThe pandemic creates some risks for us. We have several plans in place in the event that it is no longer safe to perform inside. First, we will require audience members to be masked and to have proof of vaccination. If that is not sufficient, we will either move the play outside, or record the performance for streaming, hopefully with the opportunity to mount it live in the spring. Either way, the show will go on, as safely as possible.  Performance DetailsA Hero's Journey will be performed October 22-24 at 7:30pm at the Beacon Performing Arts Center on Main Street in Beacon, NY.Tickets are available here; https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/5237804 **All audience members must show proof of vaccination and wear a mask during the performance. The performer will be unmasked and socially-distanced. This show is meant for adults. Mature, vaccinated kids age 12+ may attend with parental discretion. There are intense moments, adult themes of grief, and a curse word or two. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute that doesn't mean you can't help!Please, get the word out and make some noise about our campaign by sharing it on your social media!

<div>
<p><b><i>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”</i> </b>Arthur C. Clarke</p>
<p>     Every project is born from an idea and it is achieved with a lot of work, dedication, but above all this, joy.</p>
<p>     We are a team of young artists, which try to find new exciting ways of expressing themselves and the world, eager to explore the depths in art, waiting to discover new forms of it, but at the same time able to acknowledge the values of the past.</p>
<p>      We took our chance to experiment and innovate and came up with an idea that we wish so much to put in to practice: an artistic journey, in which arts connect and cross with advanced technology, practically a live video-game-show. We believe a show of this kind is what the contemporary audience was waiting for: so complex, spectacular, surprising and profound.</p>
<p>     Our show tells the story of two unique characters, which go on an amazing fantastic adventure. Once they complete new tasks, a new door opens in front of them and they jump from one fantastic universe to another, experiencing unbelievable situations. Besides the two main characters, the story revolves around other steampunk characters who perform their entire action in a maze with different fantasy rooms, thus we invented the phobia room, the inverse room and another 9 that we'll keep secret for the moment.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1199706/files/20150205142551-Untitled-1.jpg?1423175151"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>     We believe the show is a complete one, because of the acting, dancing, acrobatics, stage combat, magic and fire-show, which the actors will perform. But what makes this performance so amazing is that we want to add special effects, video mapping and video projection in order to create an immersive experience.</p>
<p>     In this show we're using video projection in all possible forms. We want to use a big video projection screen to split the stage in two halves enabling us to play both in front and behind it as shadows (fig.1). Besides the big projection screen mentioned above, behind it there will be 3 more screens, creating a room composed of 3 walls and a projection floor, making possible the projection on 4 sides/screens (fig. 2).</p>

<p>    As you go further and further into the story, mysterious shapes, graphics and animations are revealed. And what better style to make this fantastic performance expressive and modern, than steampunk costumes and masks, that go against convention,expressing so well one’s individuality individuality.   </p>
<p> The actors will perform with masks as in Commedia dell' Arte but without using text, only non-verbal language, accompanied by music, video effects, lights and special effects. We want to make this production non-verbal to be understood by everyone, to reach the hearts and attention of the entire world.</p>
<p>     Unlike Commedia dell' Arte, we will use steampunk masks ,as it was said earlier, thus covering the entire face to create unique characters and why not, maybe a new form of theatre characterized by steampunk masks.</p>
<p>    ""Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction and fantasy literature and art that commonly features some aspect of steam-powered machinery, especially in a setting inspired by industrialized Western civilization during the 19th century. Steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the 19th century's British Victorian era or American ""Wild West"", in a post-apocalyptic future during which steam power has maintained mainstream use, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power."" - Wikipedia</p>
<p>     Of course, the fantastic world connects to reality on many levels, probing relationships between image and self, freedom and restraint, connection and separation, success and failure and uses symbols and generally valid characteristics of the human soul. To add more spice, the story ends in a magical, shocking, unexpected way.</p>
<p>     For this show we're building some amazing stage decor which we will use it as it is for its functionality, but we also want to project on it, using video mapping technology. The decor itself playfully highlights, deconstructs, rotates, recontextualises and generally manipulates geometries, in order to create a new visual dimension and optical illusions.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
<p>Limitless School of Dance is a Christian dance studio that teaches all ages and skill levels from 3 years to adult. Since our purpose is to glorify God through dance, we want to make our classes as accessible to as many families as possible. On average, our prices are less than half of what you would pay at a typical studio.</p>
<p>In a world where dance has become overly sexualized, either in the dance moves themselves, the clothing worn, the lyrics of songs, or in the obscene amount of makeup worn by young dancers, Christians either have to compromise their values or simply not pursue their passions. At Limitless, we keep our classes wholesome and captivating. We do not perform inappropriate moves, our dress code focuses on teaching our students modesty, we only use Christian music, and our dancers wear not much more makeup than lip gloss when performing.</p>
<h3>Our Needs</h3>
<p>Our dance studio currently consists of one dance room that is only halfway being utilized. The room's dimensions are 34'x35', and we only have dance flooring covering 16'x30'.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to create a second dance room out of a smaller
     room that we have in the back of the studio. This room will need
     construction work, dance flooring, mirrors, paint, etc. This is
     estimated to cost $5,000.</li>
<li>We need to purchase enough dance flooring to finish
     covering the main dance room. This will cost $2,000.</li>
<li>If money permits, we would also like to purchase sprung
     floors for both dance rooms. On the low end of estimates, this
     should cost at least $8,000.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Being a one room studio, our class scheduling abilities are very restricted. We can only offer about 20 classes per week during afterschool hours (4:30-9:00 pm). With various styles and levels of dance, those 20 classes get filled up pretty fast. We constantly have to turn families away simply because our studio does not have the capacity to hold more classes. Having a second dance room would allow us to double our class offerings. Also, having more dance flooring in our current dance room will allow us to have larger classes.</p>
<p>At Limitless School of Dance, we do not want cost to ever be the deciding factor for any family. While our tuition is already very low, we do have dancers in families that have lost their jobs or simply do not make very much money at the jobs they currently have.

<p>Thank you for your support.</p></div>","Our Philosophy
Limitless School of Dance is a Christian dance studio that teaches all ages and skill levels from 3 years to adult. Since our purpose is to glorify God through dance, we want to make our classes as accessible to as many families as possible. On average, our prices are less than half of what you would pay at a typical studio.
In a world where dance has become overly sexualized, either in the dance moves themselves, the clothing worn, the lyrics of songs, or in the obscene amount of makeup worn by young dancers, Christians either have to compromise their values or simply not pursue their passions. At Limitless, we keep our classes wholesome and captivating. We do not perform inappropriate moves, our dress code focuses on teaching our students modesty, we only use Christian music, and our dancers wear not much more makeup than lip gloss when performing.
Our Needs
Our dance studio currently consists of one dance room that is only halfway being utilized. The room's dimensions are 34'x35', and we only have dance flooring covering 16'x30'.

We need to create a second dance room out of a smaller
     room that we have in the back of the studio. This room will need
     construction work, dance flooring, mirrors, paint, etc. This is
     estimated to cost $5,000.
We need to purchase enough dance flooring to finish
     covering the main dance room. This will cost $2,000.
If money permits, we would also like to purchase sprung
     floors for both dance rooms. On the low end of estimates, this
     should cost at least $8,000.

Your Impact
Being a one room studio, our class scheduling abilities are very restricted. We can only offer about 20 classes per week during afterschool hours (4:30-9:00 pm). With various styles and levels of dance, those 20 classes get filled up pretty fast. We constantly have to turn families away simply because our studio does not have the capacity to hold more classes. Having a second dance room would allow us to double our class offerings. Also, having more dance flooring in our current dance room will allow us to have larger classes.
At Limitless School of Dance, we do not want cost to ever be the deciding factor for any family. While our tuition is already very low, we do have dancers in families that have lost their jobs or simply do not make very much money at the jobs they currently have. The last thing we want is for the dancer to have to give up dancing because their family cannot afford the tuition. Therefore we have dancers that dance on further reduced tuition or even have their tuition waived.
This hospitality comes with a cost. While we are able to keep our doors open, we are not able to do much more. Your contribution will help us to make dancing in a wholesome, encouraging, Christian environment a possibility for more families.

<h3>Monroe Community Players, who have been a part of Monroe Michigan for nearly
seventy years, are struggling with rising production costs which are now threatening
to end their tradition of presenting live dramatic theater in the area.</h3>
<p>

Monroe Community Players do not own their own
building or have their own performance space. The majority of the funds we are
seeking are to cover the cost of the theater rental.  The cost for renting the performance space
alone is now over $3,000 for one production. <br/><br/></p>

<p><b>We need $3170</b> to cover the rental of the La-Z-Boy Center Meyer Theater.  This covers two weeks of use: one in the scene shop where we build our set, and the second the week of actual production.  Included in the facility rental is an in-house lighting director, security and maintenance.  It does not include use of the sound system.

<p><b>We estimate the set materials at $700</b>. While we will be re-using materials (4x4s, 2x4s, platforms and stairs) that we have from previous productions, we will still need to buy additional lumber, foam core sheets, hardware, and paint.  Our goal is to be as frugal as possible, and we hope to be under this estimate.<br/><br/></p>

Monroe Community Players, P.O. Box 23, Monroe, Michigan, 48161</b><br/>
<br/>
</div></div>","Monroe Community Players, who have been a part of Monroe Michigan for nearly
seventy years, are struggling with rising production costs which are now threatening
to end their tradition of presenting live dramatic theater in the area.


Monroe Community Players do not own their own
building or have their own performance space. The majority of the funds we are
seeking are to cover the cost of the theater rental.  The cost for renting the performance space
alone is now over $3,000 for one production. 


We perform at Monroe County Community College, so the money we spend
there helps our local community college and our local community.

A Man For All Seasons is a sponsored project of Monroe Community Players, a non-profit arts service 501(c)3 organization located in Monroe Michigan. Contributions for the purposes of producing A Man For All Seasons must be made payable to Monroe Community Players and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. 



Keep dramatic theater alive!  

Monroe Community Players is currently the only all-volunteer group in the area still producing Shakespeare and classic dramas. 



In the past MCP has produced such dramas as The Crucible, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Of Mice and Men, and many others in Monroe Community Players’s long history.  Monroe Community Players also has a tradition of bi-annually producing Shakespeare plays. Past shows include A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, and most recently King Lear.



Monroe
Community Players is an entirely volunteer organization, with no paid positions. From Board Members to performers, all are volunteers
donating their time and talents because they believe that theater matters!




We are reaching out to everyone who supports locally produced dramas.
Where your donation will be used


We need to pay for the rental of the facility.
Our goal is set at $5000.  This was to cover the rental of the La-Z-Boy Center Meyer Theater, publicity costs and materials for the set.  (We did round up ;-))
We need $3170 to cover the rental of the La-Z-Boy Center Meyer Theater.  This covers two weeks of use: one in the scene shop where we build our set, and the second the week of actual production.  Included in the facility rental is an in-house lighting director, security and maintenance.  It does not include use of the sound system. If we want to use the in-house sound system, we would have to pay for a sound technician.  As of this writing, we intend to cut costs by doing the sound effects off stage and not use the Meyer's theater system.


We would be spending $1000 for publicity.  The majority of this will be going towards advertising in our local newspaper, The Monroe News.  We feel that we should support local business and our advertising dollars stay in our own community this way.  We will be using it to place five ads:  two the week before the show and three the week of the show.  This will allow us to take advantage of a cheaper rate The Monroe News offers for non-profit organizations.
We estimate the set materials at $700. While we will be re-using materials (4x4s, 2x4s, platforms and stairs) that we have from previous productions, we will still need to buy additional lumber, foam core sheets, hardware, and paint.  Our goal is to be as frugal as possible, and we hope to be under this estimate.
Perks!

We are grateful for any donation of course!!  If we were able to reach out to 5000 people, and if they all donated $1 we would be set!  But if you are able to donate a bit more, we are offering a variety of perks for all different levels!  From your name as a donor in our program, seats to the show to a special meet and greet with the cast and the director, there is something for everyone!  We are very thrilled to offer at the $100 level a special ""theater geek"" t-shirt.  Please let us know your size in a private message in your donation!

  Wrap Up

Any and all funds Monroe Community Players raise during this campaign will go directly to its production of A Man For All Seasons  by Robert Bolt, produced with special arrangement with Samuel French.  If we raise funds above the $5000 goal, they will go directly to the next production in the Monroe Community Players Main Stage Series for  2014-15.

<blockquote>""A lot of it is just about listening to transgender people and taking the lead from trans folks... I don’t represent the entirety of the trans community.  There’s multiple experiences and multiple relationships to one’s identity, and so it’s really about listening to individuals in terms of how they define themselves and describe themselves and taking people at their word – being willing to let go of preconceptions we have about people who are different from us and taking people on their own terms.""</blockquote>
<p><b><i>Trans Scripts</i></b> is the result of four years of research and interviews conducted by writer Paul Lucas, who traveled across the US, Europe, India, and Cuba to interview people of transgender experience.  With the help of respected dramaturge, <b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Jenness"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Morgan Jenness</a></b>, Paul has created a groundbreaking theatrical experience that brings to life the real stories of a broad cross-section of extraordinary trans women as they embark on a journey to embrace their authentic selves.</p>
<p>The stories of these brave trans women are, at turns, compelling, surprising, inspiring, funny and harrowing, but foremost, they are human.  The moral of the piece is that our similarities far outweigh our differences, and it is from this truth that understanding is built.</p>

<p>Edinburgh is an expensive undertaking, but not when compared with trying to open a show of this size off-Broadway, which would cost a minimum of $500,000.  The Fringe will afford the opportunity for the play to be seen by some

development to becoming fully realized productions. </p>
<p>It was a perfect start in what we knew would be a huge step
forward in the process. And so... the venue was booked -- a
beautiful 175-seat concert hall -- the actors were ready -- we had been
rehearsing diligently for five days -- and we were all set to take the stage to
bring the show before an audience. Our date, however, was January 26th -- which
had its own billing as ""the snow storm of the century"" -- and with
NYC totally shut down -- we were forced to cancel the presentation. </p>
<p>It was impossible to reschedule in the short term as many in the
show had other commitments or were going on to other shows. We have rescheduled
for March 16, 2015 – that’s good news! But will this require us to go back into
the rehearsal room, re-hire the actors (and re-cast some of the roles), and pay
the creative fees. Unfortunately, the capital we had was spent for the initial
presentation.</p>

<h3>What we're up to...</h3>
<p>Dancing Sky Theatre launched it's first Twinkle Lights Campaign about 10 years ago, and were able to raise funds in order to purchase our own, although older, lighting system.  The time has come to upgrade our system and update some equipment, so it's time to bring back the Twinkle Lights Campaign!</p>
<strong> </strong>
</div><strong> </strong><div>

Dancing Sky Theatre launched it's first Twinkle Lights Campaign about 10 years ago, and were able to raise funds in order to purchase our own, although older, lighting system.  The time has come to upgrade our system and update some equipment, so it's time to bring back the Twinkle Lights Campaign!

</p><p>A
good friend asked the age old question, “Why do you do what you do” or why start
an event planning business, and honestly it’s because of the masquerade. </p>
<p>In
undergrad, as an English major, we had to read a play called “The Rover.” If
anyone has ever said that a story changed their lives, this one was the play
that did it for me. Sounds cheesy or scripted but honest to God it’s true. It
was the first masquerade I’ve read. It was during Carnival where people dressed
in masks to hide their true identities or nobility, or gender even. People who
were arranged to be married to someone else, or was arranged to be in the
nunnery, prostitutes who wanted love, or people who weren’t of noble blood but
wanted to marry above them, they all dressed in masks and paraded around to be
someone else; the person they truly wanted to be. The idea of the masquerade is
to be able to express your true self while disguising your prejudged
appearance. </p>
<p>So
I first tried to put on a masquerade ball as a fundraiser in college, It
wasn’t as successful as we hoped, due to low attendance, but it was a rush knowing
that I produced an entire school wide event.   </p>
<p>And
then I fell in love with Greek mythology and the goddess Aphrodite. She was the
goddess of love, passion, and procreation, and that was exactly me. I’m
passionate about this craft and I want to create event for people to love.</p>
<p>And
that’s what I strive for. I want to put on events to allow people who are
nervous, shy or afraid of confessing what they are in to or want to try, and
can experience an event like no other. I wanted to make events that people can
call a one of a kind truly exceptional experience. Something exotic or strange
or liberating, something they can dress up sexy to or seductive; something that’s
not their typical norm. And what better way than a masquerade. They allow
people to express their inner most desires by parading around as the wild souls
they are deep down inside, or let their inner goddess out. </p>
<p>I
loved the grand scale events that my twin sister, Kamyla, and I watched in
movies or in plays. Having stage backgrounds, we loved theatre and films and I
always wanted to be a part of it and producing those type of creative events that
moved people. That’s how I got into creative writing and imagining these
fantastic events. And this is where the

<p>Following its Thanksgiving Eve
1931 opening, Charlottesville's Paramount Theater became a landmark overnight.
One of Charlottesville’s premiere destinations, The Paramount made movie-going
a special experience. Audiences numbering in the thousands each week would come
as much to escape into opulent surroundings as to watch a show. For four
decades, the grand movie palace hosted hundreds of films, war bond drives,
fashion shows, cartoons for kids, and popular rock-and-roll concerts,
entertaining multiple generations of area families. </p>
<p>The Paramount remained
Charlottesville’s crown jewel until closing its doors for good in 1974, as businesses and shoppers began to move away from the downtown area. Even as the lights dimmed on the
marquee, the theater was not forgotten: almost from the moment it closed,
efforts were launched to save the theater from real and constant threats of
demolition. In 1992, the non-profit Paramount Theater, Inc. purchased the building
and spent the next 12 years raising the funds necessary to complete not only
the meticulous restoration of the theater, but also the creation of new
facilities enabling The Paramount to step into its new role as a regional
performing arts center.  <br/></p>
