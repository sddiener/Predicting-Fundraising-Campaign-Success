<p><strong>FINAL THOUGHTS. </strong>  As the Indiegogo campaign is finishing, I expect some of you are checking back to see what happened.  First, a huge THANK YOU to those wonderful people who have contributed.  You will be kept informed and your support gives me both the desire and obligation to make it happen. We will not give up.  So I will post no more news here, even though there is some.  You can be checking our progress at cambyocar.com.  Thanks for looking!</p>
<p><em><strong>October 17. </strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>The Hybrid option.   </strong></em>Based on costs and our own needs for a bit longer range - we live on a farm which makes a trip to town and back pushing the range limits of the pure electric - we have decided to build the first CambYo as a hybrid. See the ""Updates"" section for a full explanation of why, how, and why the Prius etc are NOT an example to follow for efficient hybrids!  </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>The hybrid option ALSO gives us cabin heat for winter use in cold climates!</em> </p>
<p><em><strong>(started August 28, 2012)  </strong>This is our little electric car design, a super simple and practical electric car that can be built anywhere in the world.  Profits from developed countries support open source plans online for developing countries.  This model took me one week to build (after months of design work), so the real thing is NOT that hard to do....once you have the plans.  </em><em>(note: The Reva is Indian, not Italian, I'm not sure why I said that… sorry.)</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Why is our project important?</strong></em> </p>
<p>It's important because the world needs to change, and quick.   Think about it ... since the pioneering Model T Ford of 1909 our wasteful cars have driven our wasteful energy and economic systems.  Our motto is: ""To change the world, we have to change the car.""   Consider that most developing countries import far more used cars than new ones, then become slaves to imported fuel and expensive imported parts.  Expensive electric cars from the big companies mean very slow change, if ever, because they will take years to ""trickle down"" to the masses, and replacement batteries and parts will always be expensive.  So gasoline cars will continue to glut the system for decades, unless we do something radical.  Our campaign is to change the world with a ""Model T of Electric Cars"" - not for everybody but for enough people to make a REAL difference.  The difference is NOT just that it is electric but that it can be built in developing countries or by individuals anywhere, independent of the petrodollar and mega-factory system that enslaves hundreds of millions of people.  CambYo Mundial, or World Change, is both our car's name and our goal, from the 99% for the 99%.  Different future versions are planned.  </p>
<p>Electric cars can be much simpler than gasoline or diesel cars.  Of course ours will not be for everybody at first.  If you would like an electric Tata Nano you will like our CambYo Mundial.  And if you don't tens or hundreds of millions of others will, enough to make a difference, and maybe start a revolution in power to the people. And if people in Rwanda or Nepal where we won't have patents want to build them at no profit to us, fantastic!</p>
<p><em><strong>Why can I do it?</strong> </em>  </p>
<p>I am Jesse Blenn, a 56-year-old mechanic, inventor, and vehicle designer originally from Westmoreland, Kansas, USA.   I have worked with water and electric power as well as cars, small airplanes (FAA Airframe Certificate 3240001), airships, and many other things.  You can see my resume under the ""Gallery"" tab, at the bottom.   You can contact me at <a href=""mailto:jesseblenn@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jesseblenn@gmail.com</a>.   Here are some of several  projects I have worked on:</p>

<p><span>My forte is designing and making simple things that work, and I see both the need and business potential to make an affordable electric car that can be made in any good shop. I am fluent in Spanish and live in Costa Rica, which really needs cheap electric vehicles, has renewable hydroelectric power available, and has the very ambitious but up-to-now unrealistic goal of being carbon neutral by 2021. They will never make it without help, so let’s do it.  If we succeed we can be an example to change the world, and if you personally want to build a simple and affordable electric car you can, and you can also own part of the company if you choose. </span></p>
<p><span>As a full time student the last five years (Troy University Bsc in Business Admin, Magna Cum Laude October 2011) I don´t have savings available for this project. I have dedicated a lot of my time since graduation to this project. We need your help, but not your free help rewarded by your name on some plaque or website and a t-shirt.  You too can have access to all the information you need to build your car (let me make the mistakes and correct them first!). If we can get the expected CR government grants (average 65% of prototype cost) it will multiply up to 200% the effect of the help you give us, and thus help it happen sooner.  </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Financials.</em></strong></p>
<p>Toyota and others spend hundreds of millions to develop a new car.  We don't need even hundreds of thousands of dollars because if we did it would mean that we have failed from the start.   </p>
<p>Our next steps are to build a full-size mockup to be sure everything about the Mundial is user-friendly, adapt our large carport for some serious work while we begin serious construction, and work on our business plan, for which we will be getting realistic numbers. From my experience with small airplanes I know about half the cost of the first vehicle will be parts and about half is labor. (both will be less in production).  I can work for $15 per hour, my helpers for about half that, and you will have updates to show where the money goes.  Our materials will be about $10,000 (much less later in quantity purchases) and the labor will realistically be more than that for the first one once we include testing, jig construction etc.</p>
<p>Our cost of production should be under $10,000 and we hope that in production dealers can sell the Mundial for about $12 to $15,000 in Costa Rica, where cars both new and used are more expensive than say the US. We expect the CR government to be good customers due a law that favors their use of electric cars (they have several Revas).  Our small company is now legal and is called Asesorias para el Desarrollo or ASPADE.  This startup company belongs to my wife's family, I am in charge of design and English communications.  Our president will finish the business plan as part of a course in the National University starting in January.  ASPADE will handle the financial and managerial aspects, including fulfilling our obligations to you to deliver on our promises.  We plan to set up the first factory as part of a local cooperative, with ASPADE in charge of technical development and international promotions, as well as kits and international sales.</p>
<p><strong><em>What if we don't reach our goal?  </em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>October 17.</strong></em>  Those of you who are watching our project will see that unless some miracle happens we will not reach our goal.   That does NOT kill the project, but does slow it down. Our hope is to be able to have me (Jesse) work full time on the project, but I will continue to work part time.  I see our next step of developing our own super simple brushless motor as extremely important to the project, and it could revoluitionize DC motors and finance the project.  We will have first results before November first.  In the end, we will likely launch a CambYo Stage 2 on Indiegogo, with more results to show from the start, and likely open to investors once the US relaxes its limits.  </p>
<p>(previous) If we don´t reach the entire goal we will definitely finish design and start construction because these can inspire a positive reaction to our application to the CR government grant (January or February 2013) that will likely let us complete the project. They even contacted us to make sure we knew that they have grant money available, which is a very positive sign.  We will be openly sharing design information with you along the way.</p>
</div>
<p><em><strong>A little more about the car....</strong></em></p>
<p>Many features are described in the video, and some are patentable so are not public including especially some aspects of the front suspension and motors.   Others will be only for those who contribute, and once we are positive that they are the best they can be!  Two curves plus straight tubes make up the unibody of welded square tubes and curved sheets, tested for rigidity to be as good as or better than other small cars (2000 or more foot-lbs per degree of torsional deflection). A major key to its simplicity is the fact that it starts with two flat frames to define the basic shape, and there are no flat sheets over 2 feet wide in the car – simplifying the tools and materials needs greatly.</p>
<p>Because we have a central battery pack, we have a separate smaller electric motor driving each rear wheel through a chain drive and that means: no clutch, no differential, no normal transmission, and that one motor can fail and the car can still make it home.  Motor controls are under the trunk floor, and we plan some neat innovations in motor design and control (I enjoy winding motors!). Definitely axial flux PM is the way to go for simplicity, local manufacture, and highest efficiency.  Our prototype may or may not have off-the-shelf motors depending on time and funding.</p>

October 17.  The Hybrid option.   Based on costs and our own needs for a bit longer range - we live on a farm which makes a trip to town and back pushing the range limits of the pure electric - we have decided to build the first CambYo as a hybrid.

Our hope is to be able to have me (Jesse) work full time on the project, but I will continue to work part time.  I see our next step of developing our own super simple brushless motor as extremely important to the project, and it could revoluitionize DC motors and finance the project.  We will have first results before November first.  In the end, we will likely launch a CambYo Stage 2 on Indiegogo, with more results to show from the start, and likely open to investors once the US relaxes its limits.  
(previous) If we don´t reach the entire goal we will definitely finish design and start construction because these can inspire a positive reaction to our application to the CR government grant (January or February 2013) that will likely let us complete the project. They even contacted us to make sure we knew that they have grant money available, which is a very positive sign.  We will be openly sharing design information with you along the way.

A little more about the car....
Many features are described in the video, and some are patentable so are not public including especially some aspects of the front suspension and motors.   Others will be only for those who contribute, and once we are positive that they are the best they can be!  Two curves plus straight tubes make up the unibody of welded square tubes and curved sheets, tested for rigidity to be as good as or better than other small cars (2000 or more foot-lbs per degree of torsional deflection). A major key to its simplicity is the fact that it starts with two flat frames to define the basic shape, and there are no flat sheets over 2 feet wide in the car – simplifying the tools and materials needs greatly.
Because we have a central battery pack, we have a separate smaller electric motor driving each rear wheel through a chain drive and that means: no clutch, no differential, no normal transmission, and that one motor can fail and the car can still make it home.  Motor controls are under the trunk floor, and we plan some neat innovations in motor design and control (I enjoy winding motors!). Definitely axial flux PM is the way to go for simplicity, local manufacture, and highest efficiency.  Our prototype may or may not have off-the-shelf motors depending on time and funding.
 Thanks for reading!

<p>The Bamboo Center has been training young men and women from rural communities to manufacture several types of products out of bamboo. The time has now come where the Center is constrained by its capacity and thus cannot meet demand for its products. The Center has current capacity to make 12 bamboo bikes per month, but has the potential to ship 30 bamboo bikes per month based on confirmed buyer interest. $2,000 will provide the essential funding to purchase the necessary equipment and supplies to service this unmet demand. If we can raise in excess of this amount, the funds will allow further equipment purchases to facilitate a broadened product range beyond bikes, handbags, placemats, purses and sandals to other marketable products.</p>
<p><strong>Our Desired Impact</strong></p>
<p>Expanding production capacity serves our two ultimate goals. Firstly, it will provide greater employment opportunities for rural youth who are struggling to break out of the cycle of poverty. They will be taught a trade and benefit from secure employment and steady income. Secondly, it allows us to generate greater profits from the Center to support and expand educational development programsfor children in the community and thus make us less reliant on donor funding for those initiatives. These educational development programs help to ensure that children in the community can attend school and maximize their potential to secure employment as adults.</p>
<p><strong>Why Bamboo?</strong></p>
<p>Bamboo is incredibly strong, light and eco-friendly. It is one of the fastest growing plants in the world and requires no fertilizers or pesticides. Bamboo promotes sustainable living. We have our own bamboo plantation and this ensures that we have an abundant supply of raw materials to process once we have the necessary equipment and supplies.</p>
<p><strong>The Perks on Offer</strong></p>
<p>As a way to thank those who donate we are offering our quality bamboo products as perks. You’ll get to enjoy our products while knowing you’ve helped to grow our organization and directly benefit our community!</p>
<p>Donors can choose among the following perks;</p>
<p>-          $15 gets a bamboo purse</p>
<p>-          $25 gets four bamboo placements</p>
<p>-          $30 gets a bamboo bag</p>
<p>-          $50 gets a bamboo hand bag and placemats</p>
<p>-          $100 gets a bamboo hand bag, placemats and a purse</p>
<p>-          $500 gets a bamboo bicycle Frame</p>
<p>All perks will be shipped to donors as quickly as practicable.</p>
<p><strong>My Passion for the Yonso Project</strong></p>
<p>I am a young social entrepreneur whose primary focus is to create educational and economic opportunities for the youth, women and children in the rural communities I grew up in. I have dedicated the last 7 years of my life to breaking the cycle of poverty that permeates rural communities in Ghana. With the generous support of volunteers and donors, the Yonso Project has provided scholarships and educational assistance to children, microfinance to female entrepreneurs and training and employment to youths. We have ambitious goals to grow the organization and its impact exponentially over the coming years and with that hopefully become fully self-sustaining.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through the Yonso Project, I was fortunate to win the 2012 edition of Airtel Touching Lives as well as the Ghana National Youth Achievers Award for grass root and rural community development. It was humbling to be recognized nationally for work done to improve my community.</p>

<p><strong>3Bee è il primo progetto italiano nato dall'idea di 3 ricercatori per la salvaguardia degli alveari e la protezione dell'ambiente. Precisamente, il progetto 3Bee comprende la realizzazione di un dispositivo elettronico per il monitoraggio degli alveari di apis mellifera. Il dispositivo permetterà di interpretare i bisogni delle api, ascoltando suoni, odori, temperatura, umidità dell'alveare. Il nostro obiettivo è di rivoluzionare l'apicoltura al fine di trovare nuove cure per aiutare le api!​</strong></p>

<h2><font color=""#f39200"">Il Problema</font></h2>
<h3><strong><font color=""#f2ad00"">Biodiversity warning!!!</font></strong></h3>
<p> Le api non solo contribuiscono quotidianamente a preservare e propagare molteplici specie vegetali, ma ci riforniscono di preziosissimi prodotti quali miele, propoli, cera e polline. </p>
<h3><strong><font color=""#f2ad00"">Moria delle api</font></strong></h3>
<p>Negli ultimi anni l’integrità delle colonie di api è stata sempre più minacciata da molti fattori sia naturali che antropici. In molti stati europei la mortalità delle api ha superato il 50%! </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.3bee.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479053755/lr2qovwrvbrob1zetpyr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong><font color=""#f2ad00"">Pesticidi: sono veramente così pericolosi?</font></strong></h3>
<p>Certamente! Tutte le sostanze chimiche disperse nell’ambiente possono venire in contatto con le api. Bottinando nettare e polline, le api possono trasportare e accumulare molte di queste sostanze all’interno del proprio alveare causando il collasso improvviso dell’intero alveare (Colony Collapse Disorder).</p>
<h3><strong><font color=""#f2ad00"">Trattamenti chimici per arginare parassiti e batteri</font></strong></h3>
<p>Prima dell’arrivo in Italia dell’acaro <i>Varroa Destructor</i> (1981), in apicoltura erano veramente pochi i casi in cui era richiesto l’utilizzo di trattramenti chimici. Ora in commercio esistono prodotti chimici per combattere la varroatosi, ormai indispensabile per la sopravvivenza dell'alveare. Oltre a questi prodotti, vi sono anche quelli antibiotici utilizzati per far fronte ad infezioni batteriche. Nonostante molti di questi composti siano severamente vietati in Unione Europea a causa dell’ingente quantità di residui chimici rinvenuti nella cera e nel miele, in numerosi paesi extra UE sono ammessi!</p>
<h3><strong><font color=""#f2ad00"">Miele commerciale: importato, non certificato ed inquinato</font></strong></h3>
<p>Vi siete mai soffermati a leggere le etichette del miele che comprate al supermercato? Se non vi è mai capitato, provateci. Vi stupirà leggere quanto del miele che mettiamo sulle nostre tavole proviene da paesi esteri dove la regolamentazione è molto permissiva. Quello che ne risulta è un miele di scarsa qualità la cui origine non può essere né tracciata né garantita  Non tutto il miele fa bene! State attenti!</p>

3Bee è il primo progetto italiano nato dall'idea di 3 ricercatori per la salvaguardia degli alveari e la protezione dell'ambiente. Precisamente, il progetto 3Bee comprende la realizzazione di un dispositivo elettronico per il monitoraggio degli alveari di apis mellifera. Il dispositivo permetterà di interpretare i bisogni delle api, ascoltando suoni, odori, temperatura, umidità dell'alveare. Il nostro obiettivo è di rivoluzionare l'apicoltura al fine di trovare nuove cure per aiutare le api!​
E' troppo difficile donare qui? la pagina ti spaventa? Scriveteci info@3bee.eu
 

AD OGNI DONAZIONE...

 
...LA GIUSTA RICOMPENSA
Un buonissimo vasetto di miele Italiano di Cardo
 
2 Vasetti di miele Italiano, in una magifica confezione di legno. La scritta a laser sulla confezione seglila tu. Quando comporrai il puzzle guarda la sorpresa!
 
Monitora una delle arnie Hi-Tech 3Bee. Un apicoltore in tutta italia installerà il nostro dispositivo e tu comodamente da casa potrai guardare i progressi delle api e il loro stato di salute. Finita la stagione apistica potrai riscuotere il tuo miele a un prezzo conveniente! Questo è il primo sistema al mondo che mette in contatto diretto il consumatore con il prodotto.
                            
Visita in apiario! Hai mai voluto entrare in contatto con le api? Hai mai pensato di indossare una tuta gialle e toccare con mano il miele caldo? A fine giornata, inoltre, potrai goderti il miglior miele italiano, assieme a un degustatore professionista.

 
                      

Il Problema
Biodiversity warning!!!
 Le api non solo contribuiscono quotidianamente a preservare e propagare molteplici specie vegetali, ma ci riforniscono di preziosissimi prodotti quali miele, propoli, cera e polline. 
Moria delle api
Negli ultimi anni l’integrità delle colonie di api è stata sempre più minacciata da molti fattori sia naturali che antropici. In molti stati europei la mortalità delle api ha superato il 50%! 

 
Pesticidi: sono veramente così pericolosi?
Certamente! Tutte le sostanze chimiche disperse nell’ambiente possono venire in contatto con le api. Bottinando nettare e polline, le api possono trasportare e accumulare molte di queste sostanze all’interno del proprio alveare causando il collasso improvviso dell’intero alveare (Colony Collapse Disorder).
Trattamenti chimici per arginare parassiti e batteri
Prima dell’arrivo in Italia dell’acaro Varroa Destructor (1981), in apicoltura erano veramente pochi i casi in cui era richiesto l’utilizzo di trattramenti chimici. Ora in commercio esistono prodotti chimici per combattere la varroatosi, ormai indispensabile per la sopravvivenza dell'alveare. Oltre a questi prodotti, vi sono anche quelli antibiotici utilizzati per far fronte ad infezioni batteriche. Nonostante molti di questi composti siano severamente vietati in Unione Europea a causa dell’ingente quantità di residui chimici rinvenuti nella cera e nel miele, in numerosi paesi extra UE sono ammessi!
Miele commerciale: importato, non certificato ed inquinato
Vi siete mai soffermati a leggere le etichette del miele che comprate al supermercato? Se non vi è mai capitato, provateci. Vi stupirà leggere quanto del miele che mettiamo sulle nostre tavole proviene da paesi esteri dove la regolamentazione è molto permissiva. Quello che ne risulta è un miele di scarsa qualità la cui origine non può essere né tracciata né garantita  Non tutto il miele fa bene! State attenti!
 

LA SOLUZIONE
Il progetto 3Bee
3Bee è un progetto realizzato da un gruppo di giovani ricercatori provenienti dai campi più disparati: dall’elettronica quantistica alle nanobiotecnologie. Grazie alla fusione delle nostre abilità con le nostre passioni, è nato il progetto Hive-Tech di 3Bee. La nostra missione è quella di salvaguardare la vita delle api attraverso la realizzazione di un dispositivo elettronico equipaggiato con sensori all'avanguardia per il monitoraggio degli alveari di Apis Mellifera. Nello specifico, permette il controllo da remoto dello stato di salute delle api e consente di monitorare: l’attività di bottinaggio, l’andamento della covata, la presenza della regina, l’imminente sciamatura, la quantità di scorta e l’insorgenza di malattie. 

Inoltre, al consumatore proponiamo una nuova piattaforma eCommerce all'insegna della più completa trasparenza e tracciabilità su cui potrà acquistare dagli apiari convenzionati 3Bee svariati prodotti dell’alveare come miele, cera, propoli etc.
I nostri sensori

E-HAND­­
Comprende 2 tipologie di sensori: il primo per la rilevazione della temperatura e umidità interne all'alveare e il secondo per la misurazione dell'incremento ponderale dell’arnia (bilancia).
Con il primo sensore si potrà avere una panoramica sullo stato di salute dell'alveare. Con il secondo si andrà, invece, a monitorare produttività, necessità e gravi incidenti nell’alveare.
E-NOSE
Costituito da sensori per la rilevazione della qualità dell’aria, ossigeno, anidride carbonica. In analogia a quanto svolto per altre tipologie di allevamenti animali sono il primo strumento di allarme nel caso di malattie e virosi.
 
E-EAR
Al dispositivo sono collegati alcuni microfoni ottimizzati per l’acquisizione dell’emissione sonora dei suoni dell’alveare. Il dispositivo permette di acquisire l’intensità e lo spettro sonoro delle vibrazioni delle api, comprese tra 50 Hz fino a 600 Hz. Grazie al linguaggio sonoro delle api sarà possibile prevedere la sciamatura delle api con largo anticipo nonché ascoltare la nascita di nuove regine.
 
E-EYE
Il dispositivo è dotato di sensori capaci di analizzare l’intensità e lo spettro luminoso della luce ambientale. Grazie a tale sensore sarà possibile valutare l'influenza dello spettro luminoso sull'attività bottinatrice delle api.

<p></p>
<p>Indian
Point, a three-unit nuclear power plant 25 miles north of New York City, first
opened in 1962. The original reactor was decommissioned in 1974. On midnight,
December 12, 2015, the last federal operating 40-year license for
the remaining two expired. That morning, several dozen concerned citizens
held ""caution"" tape across the entrance of the plant to draw
attention to the danger to 20 million people living in a 50-mile
radius caused by the continued operation of the problem-plagued plant. We
were all asked to move. The eleven of us who held fast to the tape were
arrested.</p>
<p>Our arraignment
is scheduled for the Buchanan Village Court on Tuesday, March 8th. We plan
to plead guilty to the charge of disorderly conduct. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p></p>
<p>We have hired an
attorney who is charging a modest fee to represent us as a group in the
courtroom on March 8th. In addition, we expect that we will each need to pay
individual fines for the disorderly conduct charge.  We are are asking for
your help in raising a total of $2,500-3,000 to cover these expenses.</p>
<p>If we are able to raise
more funds than we need to cover the court costs, the extra money will be
donated to <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">the Indian Point Safe Energy Coalition

<p>You can help us make a
statement to Entergy (Indian Point's owner) and to the federal Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) that even if they don't care about the health and
safety of the 20 million people in the 50-mile radius, we do.  Governor
Cuomo has called for Indian Point’s closure; the New York Department of
Environmental Conservation has refused to give Entergy a permit to draw from
the Hudson River the 2.5 billion gallons of water they need to operate and cool
the reactors each day. Congresswoman Nita Lowey has expressed her concern about
the aging nuclear plant sitting one mile from the intersection of two fault
lines in her Congressional district.  </p>
<p>Why are the NRC and
Entergy waiting to address the many safety issues of this aging plant? 
Help us, the #IndianPt11, get their attention by making a donation before our
court appearance. Together, we can help our officials find the political will
to close Indian Point before there are any more accidents that release
radioactive materials and pollute our groundwater.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">   </span></p>

<p>The lights will not
go out and the trains will not stop running when Indian Point closes.
Replacement power for Indian Point is already on-line. The New York State
Department of State has determined there is no need for Indian Point’s
electricity and the Public Service Commission is questioning whether Indian
Point is needed.</p>
<p>The NRC and Entergy
have not operated Indian Point safely. Radioactive leaks continue to pollute
the Hudson River and groundwater. The threat

<p></p></div>","Short Summary


Indian
Point, a three-unit nuclear power plant 25 miles north of New York City, first
opened in 1962. The original reactor was decommissioned in 1974. On midnight,
December 12, 2015, the last federal operating 40-year license for
the remaining two expired. That morning, several dozen concerned citizens
held ""caution"" tape across the entrance of the plant to draw
attention to the danger to 20 million people living in a 50-mile
radius caused by the continued operation of the problem-plagued plant. We
were all asked to move. The eleven of us who held fast to the tape were
arrested.
Our arraignment
is scheduled for the Buchanan Village Court on Tuesday, March 8th. We plan
to plead guilty to the charge of disorderly conduct. 

   What We Need  
We have hired an
attorney who is charging a modest fee to represent us as a group in the
courtroom on March 8th. In addition, we expect that we will each need to pay
individual fines for the disorderly conduct charge.  We are are asking for
your help in raising a total of $2,500-3,000 to cover these expenses.
If we are able to raise
more funds than we need to cover the court costs, the extra money will be
donated to the Indian Point Safe Energy Coalition
(IPSEC), which has been working to close Indian Point since 2001, and to
the Stony Point Convergence, which has worked with us to close the
plant since shortly after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and meltdown struck
the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan.  Excess funds will also be used for scholarships to committed anti-nuclear activists to attend the SAFE ENERGY CONFERENCE we are organizing titled, END NUCLEAR POWER NOW!  at the Stony Point Conference Center in Rockland County, NY that is scheduled from Friday night, April 29 - Sunday May 1. For more detailed info about this summit, go to:

The Impact

 
You can help us make a
statement to Entergy (Indian Point's owner) and to the federal Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) that even if they don't care about the health and
safety of the 20 million people in the 50-mile radius, we do.  Governor
Cuomo has called for Indian Point’s closure; the New York Department of
Environmental Conservation has refused to give Entergy a permit to draw from
the Hudson River the 2.5 billion gallons of water they need to operate and cool
the reactors each day. Congresswoman Nita Lowey has expressed her concern about
the aging nuclear plant sitting one mile from the intersection of two fault
lines in her Congressional district.  
Why are the NRC and
Entergy waiting to address the many safety issues of this aging plant? 
Help us, the #IndianPt11, get their attention by making a donation before our
court appearance. Together, we can help our officials find the political will
to close Indian Point before there are any more accidents that release
radioactive materials and pollute our groundwater.

Risks & Challenges
  
The lights will not
go out and the trains will not stop running when Indian Point closes.
Replacement power for Indian Point is already on-line. The New York State
Department of State has determined there is no need for Indian Point’s
electricity and the Public Service Commission is questioning whether Indian
Point is needed.
The NRC and Entergy
have not operated Indian Point safely. Radioactive leaks continue to pollute
the Hudson River and groundwater. The threat
of earthquake damage, continuing destruction of the Hudson River habitat for
fish and river life, and continued leaks of radioactive water into
the ground water are a clear and present danger.   Other Ways You Can Help

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>The San Juan Ridge Mine opened under the name Siskon Mine in the early 1990's.  After a short 1.5 years of operation it struck a major vertical water fissure, releasing an excess of 4 million gallons of groundwater per day,  dewatering many of the surrounding area's wells-- including the one for the local elementary school--, and carving local drainages down to bedrock with high pressure discharge.</p>

<p>This painful event left the surrounding natural ecosystems degraded from the inundation with mine discharge,  property values lowered by as much as 75%, school children without a proper well on site, and took the Siskon Mining Corp. itself to total bankruptcy.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Within the proposal for the mine's reopening is a request for permits to use <strong>3.5 million gallons of water per day</strong>, to use in hydraulic gold extraction.

Hello
My name is Barbara Crazy Diamond, B.Crazy for short.
I am owner and operator of the Sew Much Hemp shop in Hopkins, Belize.

Educate even more people about the uses of hemp



Why I went to Belize, Central America

Belize is a small country in Central America, a true jewel by the Carribean Sea. People come here from all
over the world for diving and snorkeling at the second largest reef in
the world.


Belize is where I have lived and
worked for the last 16 years, in a small village next to the Carribean Sea called Hopkins.
People ask me all the time, what brought me to Belize?
The simple answer is, that I work for Father Creator and Mother Earth.

For the last 25 years, I have been a hemp
activist and I have been smoking marijuana on a daily
basis for 40 years. I woke up a long time ago to the fact that the U.S. have made the most useful plant on the planet illegal. They call

for a plant. But that is not all they have done: the U.S. pays all

illegal to grow. They do not allow them to grow hemp which in return makes them more dependant on fuel from other countries.

<p>MasseReaction’s World Patented ViPAR<sup>TM</sup> technology can clean up virtually all (<b>90%+</b>) of the <b>CO<sub>2</sub>, Mercury, and many
other pollutants</b> from any modern coal or gas fired electric power plant.
It is then converted into hundreds of millions of gallons (billions of litres)
of Drop-In Renewable Liquid Transportation Fuels such as Jet, Diesel, and non-food sourced Ethanol; <i>all of which are</i> <b><i>cheaper</i></b>
than open market priced fossil based fuels.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Indoor Vertical Farming</h3>
<p>The ViPAR<sup>TM</sup> (Vertically Integrated Photo Array Reactor) is a photobioreactor capable of growing industrial quantities of algae in a perfectly controlled environment.</p>
<p>That environment is a modularized, vertically stackable, in-door housed,
photobioreactor that can perfectly control light distribution to the center of
each reactor core (tube). Current ViPAR<sup>TM</sup> technology provides for a
stacking height of over 50 feet (15 metres).</p>
<p>Light is distributed to the ViPAR<sup>TM</sup> through fiber optic cables from a remote lighting source (solar/artificial hybrid) and transmitted through the reactor growth chamber tubes; the walls of these tubes are the light emitting elements themselves.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>World Patented</h3>
<p>This patented feature allows perfect control of temperature, light frequency and intensity. This level of control makes ViPAR<sup>TM</sup> the perfect environment for algae cells to grow.</p>
<p>Each one of these features represents a revolutionary “break through” in the history of photobioreactor development. </p>
<p><b>ViPAR<sup>TM</sup> is patented around the world, and has never had to defend a single claim in any patent office anywhere in the world</b>. This is a rare occurrence in the patenting industry, and we are very proud of this solid scientific foundation.</p>
<p>ViPAR<sup>TM</sup> science is clean, investable science.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Energy Balance</h3>
<p>Algae, through photosynthesis, add energy by capturing photons from the Sun. At the <b>lowest</b> level of lighting inefficiency (artificial use only) the algae provide a positive system energy balance by about 35% (such as might be found in Alaska during the winter months).</p>
<p>Once the algae are grown, the cell walls are split and the sub-components of the algae are separated; specifically these components are lipids (oil), cytoplasm (sugar) and the cell wall itself (protein).</p>
<p>These sub components are transformed via standard practices into Drop-In Renewable Jet, Diesel (via Fischer Tropsch processing) and Ethanol (via distillation). </p>
<p><br/></p>

MasseReaction’s World Patented ViPARTM technology can clean up virtually all (90%+) of the CO2, Mercury, and many
other pollutants from any modern coal or gas fired electric power plant.
It is then converted into hundreds of millions of gallons (billions of litres)
of Drop-In Renewable Liquid Transportation Fuels such as Jet, Diesel, and non-food sourced Ethanol; all of which are cheaper
than open market priced fossil based fuels.

Indoor Vertical Farming
The ViPARTM (Vertically Integrated Photo Array Reactor) is a photobioreactor capable of growing industrial quantities of algae in a perfectly controlled environment.
That environment is a modularized, vertically stackable, in-door housed,
photobioreactor that can perfectly control light distribution to the center of
each reactor core (tube). Current ViPARTM technology provides for a
stacking height of over 50 feet (15 metres).
Light is distributed to the ViPARTM through fiber optic cables from a remote lighting source (solar/artificial hybrid) and transmitted through the reactor growth chamber tubes; the walls of these tubes are the light emitting elements themselves.

World Patented
This patented feature allows perfect control of temperature, light frequency and intensity. This level of control makes ViPARTM the perfect environment for algae cells to grow.
Each one of these features represents a revolutionary “break through” in the history of photobioreactor development. 
ViPARTM is patented around the world, and has never had to defend a single claim in any patent office anywhere in the world. This is a rare occurrence in the patenting industry, and we are very proud of this solid scientific foundation.
ViPARTM science is clean, investable science.

Energy Balance
Algae, through photosynthesis, add energy by capturing photons from the Sun. At the lowest level of lighting inefficiency (artificial use only) the algae provide a positive system energy balance by about 35% (such as might be found in Alaska during the winter months).
Once the algae are grown, the cell walls are split and the sub-components of the algae are separated; specifically these components are lipids (oil), cytoplasm (sugar) and the cell wall itself (protein).
These sub components are transformed via standard practices into Drop-In Renewable Jet, Diesel (via Fischer Tropsch processing) and Ethanol (via distillation). 


Micro Land Use Footprint
A ViPARTM farm containing tens of thousands of modules, and located next to an average modern U.S. coal fired Electric Power Plant (average 670 Mega Watts and 3.2 Million tons of CO2 annually), would only require about 50 acres (20 hectares) for the entire 3.2
million ton CO2 capture, algae production and processing. This same 50 acres also includes all storage, transportation mode interfaces, offices, parking, and green space (although, arguably, that amount of algae taking up CO2 could possibly be considered it’s own green space).
A ViPARTM algae production facility of this size would containing tens of thousands of stacked ViPARTM modules. Three 200 ft (60 metre) wide by 600 ft (180 metre) long fast erect structures house the stacked
ViPARTM module farm. They are insulated, cost effective, quick to build and hurricane resistant, with a wind rating to 125 MPH (200 km/h); they are also designed for the efficient shedding of snow.

Financial Sustainability
The product would be ~100 million U.S. gallons (380 million litres) of Jet, ~100 million U.S. gallons (380 million litres) of diesel, and ~400 million U.S. gallons (15,1 billion litres) of non-food sourced ethanol; PRICED BELOW OPEN MARKET SPOT, THESE FUELS PRODUCE ~45% Return on Investment (For the financial types) AT THIS SCALE...
...FROM A SINGLE POWER PLANT!

Phase I is our ViPARTM Technology Demonstrator. Phase II is a profitable Commercial Demonstrator. Phase III is a full scale capture of 3.2 million tons of CO2 from an average 700 Mega Watt Coal-fired electric power station. The number of jobs created by building a single ViPARTM Farm will be around 3,000.

In the U.S.A. alone, there are over 500 power plants of this size; that means full scale national deployment could represent about 15,000,000 potential job opportunities.
You can go online and see how many jobs that would mean for your country!
Just take the total Mega Watts of electricity generated by coal and natural gas...divide by 700 MW (to find the equivalent number of power plants) and then multiply by 3,000 jobs.

Significant Global Scale GHG Impact
Deployed across the entire United States alone, ViPARTM can remove 1.6 Billion tons of CO2 emissions from the Earth’s atmosphere; approximately 16% of the world’s total annual emissions. 
We need your help to build a technology demonstrator. We have the scientists and engineers ready to build the special equipment we need to construct this revolutionary device.

We believe this is an attainable goal because over 99% of Nepali production of the endangered herbs selected for our program are wild-harvested by hand by herb collectors. Training herb collectors how to farm these herbs will allow them to grow these herbs in much greater quantities than they are able to pick in the forest. Thus, we can end the necessity to pick herbs from the forest. </p><p>Second, we can improve farmer incomes by 300%. 80% of Nepal's workforce are comprised of farmers, half of whom live beneath the poverty line. Many of these farmers live in such remote areas of the country that they must walk for hours to reach the nearest dirt road. Therefore, they lack the capacity to connect effectively with the herb supply chain and as a result are susceptible to exploitation by ""herb middlemen."" </p><p>By forming worker cooperatives, Healing Herbs Nepal can cut exploitative middlemen out of the equation and return profits to farmers thereby significantly improving incomes and elevating them out of poverty. </p><p><b>Healing Herbs Nepal Team</b></p><p>•  Bhupendra Nirajan - Bhupendra is the Nepal coordinator for Healing Herbs Nepal.

Guide and driver tipsThe ImpactThe measurable objectives of this program are to reduce wild harvesting of endangered herbs by 80%. We believe this is an attainable goal because over 99% of Nepali production of the endangered herbs selected for our program are wild-harvested by hand by herb collectors. Training herb collectors how to farm these herbs will allow them to grow these herbs in much greater quantities than they are able to pick in the forest. Thus, we can end the necessity to pick herbs from the forest. Second, we can improve farmer incomes by 300%. 80% of Nepal's workforce are comprised of farmers, half of whom live beneath the poverty line. Many of these farmers live in such remote areas of the country that they must walk for hours to reach the nearest dirt road. Therefore, they lack the capacity to connect effectively with the herb supply chain and as a result are susceptible to exploitation by ""herb middlemen."" By forming worker cooperatives, Healing Herbs Nepal can cut exploitative middlemen out of the equation and return profits to farmers thereby significantly improving incomes and elevating them out of poverty.

</p><p><b>THE VISION: </b>For millennia, a thick layer of sea ice has covered much of the Arctic
and Greenland oceans. Serving as a reflective cap on the ocean, the sea ice
reflects sunlight back into the atmosphere, insulating polar locales and
maintaining lower global temperatures in the process.  Arctic sea ice is
our planet’s air conditioning system and has been regulating Earth’s climate
for millions of years.</p>
<p>The Arctic
is warming, acidifying, and changing faster than any other place on Earth,
making its inhabitants incredibly vulnerable and in need of attention. The
Elysium Artists for the Arctic project’s diverse artistic interpretation and
educational outreach program shall deliver much-needed ocean education,
inspiring arctic conservation and education for citizens of the world,
especially youths. After the expedition, the Elysium Artists for the Arctic
project will have the resources to generate memorable, hands-on learning
experiences that can be shared worldwide. </p>
<p>The Elysium
Arctic explorers are each committed to using their expertise to increase
worldwide understanding of ocean change as a key element of climate change. The
explorers will take on the personal responsibility of achieving that goal by
creating an unparalleled artistic portrait and crucial scientific index of the
current conditions in the Arctic as climate change begins to take a toll on the
region. The explorers hope the fruits of their efforts will bring the plight of
this crucial region to the attention of the world, inspire action to fight
climate change, yield vital benchmark data for measuring the future effects of
Arctic warming, and will comprise a magnificent collection of sights, sounds,
and information to be treasured by future generations.</p>
<p>We believe
the Arctic can be saved. We truly believe a small group of people can change
the world, and this imaging epic must inspire, invigorate, and serve as a call
for action to ensure the survival of artic keystone species and ultimately our
very own future on planet Earth. If you are a naturalist, scientist,
photographer, artist, or musician, consider securing<b> YOUR LEGACY</b> in the
Elysium Artists for the Arctic project by using your talent to inspire others
to better understand and care for our beautiful blue marble.</p>

</h3><p><b>STRATEGIES: </b>Elysium’s professional science team is headed by Mission Blue founder
Sylvia Earle PhD and Cabel Davis PhD of the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution. Drs. Earle and Davis and the other science team members will
deploy specialized oceanographic equipment including plankton nets, a remotely
operated vehicle (ROV),  and the video plankton recorder (VPR) to collect
data documenting ocean change in the Arctic. During the expedition, the VPR,
sampling nets, and ROV will be deployed several times to collect biological
samples as well as capture video and still images.The Elysium’s science team
also plans to engage Inuit communities in educational programs aimed at
increasing awareness of ocean biodiversity and the impacts of climate change in
the Greenlandic Arctic. Aboard the expedition vessel, guests from each
community will have the opportunity to see and participate in citizen science
in action. </p>
<p>Susan R. Eaton, the expedition geologist and science journalist, will
manage Elysium's “Bringing the Ocean to Eye Level,” an innovative ocean
educational outreach program designed to provide Elysium’s Greenland Inuit
guests with a platform to share their valued local knowledge and traditions,
contributing to a broader body of scientific knowledge about the Arctic. In
parallel, Elysium’s artists will interact with their Inuit counterparts,
contributing to a cross-cultural exchange that’s focused on the arts and
culture. Employing the Elysium’s social networks and media coverage, the Inuit
and local peoples will have the opportunity to reach out to people around the
globe. </p>
<p>Elysium's Artistic team is comprised of photographers, cinematographers,
musicians, fine artists, and modern artists who are tasked with producing
images and sounds of the Arctic in their respective interpretations of this
region of immense beauty.</p>
<p>On
board the expedition platform or support zodiac, the live feed from the ROV
inspection camera will feed directly into a laptop. For observational science
the ROV will be capable of moving underneath and around sea ice. Data collected
during the expedition will be made available to the OpenROV community, Google
Ocean, and WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) and to school children all
over the world, including students living in the Arctic. Elysium will connect to
the world before, during, and after the expedition via blogs, tweets, videos,
media interviews, magazine articles, and other outreach materials.</p><div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/990556/files/20141106005724-_AWE9705_1.jpg?1415264244"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></div><div>

<h3>
</h3></b><p><b>THE
DECLARATION: </b>This declaration affirms that the Elysium Artists for the Arctic Epic
Expedition is more than just an exploration event. It is a commitment by the
team of explorers to a greater goal beyond the adrenalin rush of a challenging
adventure. This Elysium Epic Expedition is a continuation of our ongoing
commitment to inspire and enlighten the general public and government
decision-makers around the world, and to motivate everyone to take essential
actions to restore the health of our planet.<i> <b>Elysium Epic’s Manifesto – A
Call for a Change in Attitude Toward Our Oceans.</b></i></p><p>
</p><p><b>WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT THE ARCTIC?</b></p>
<p>1.  Arctic sea ice is our planet’s air conditioning system and has
been regulating Earth’s climate for millions of years.</p>
<p>2.  The Arctic Ocean and the seas that surround it are extremely
diverse and contain a wide range of unique life.</p>
<p>3.  There are over 1000 species of ice algae, primary producers that
inhabit the underside of the sea ice, that form the foundation of the Arctic
Ocean food web upon which all other marine life depends.</p>
<p>4.  Many species of fish, birds, and marine mammals are directly
dependent upon the presence of arctic sea ice, and consequently a cold enough
Arctic, in order to survive.</p>
<p>5.  Indigenous peoples still lead subsistence lifestyles in the
Arctic and heavily depend on stable conditions and reliable food sources to
maintain their traditional culture.</p>
<p>6.  Climate in the Arctic directly affects weather patterns, storms
in particular, all over the planet.</p>
<p>7.  Frozen ground sequesters vast amounts of carbon, all of which
will be released as permafrost thaws with warming temperatures.</p>
<p>8.  Subsea permafrost also stores huge amounts of carbon in the form
of frozen organic matter that could be released as the Arctic warms.</p>
<p>9.  The Arctic is warming, acidifying, and changing faster than any
other place on Earth, making its inhabitants incredibly vulnerable and in need
of protection.</p>
<p>10. Unprecedented losses of Arctic sea ice will lead to sea level rise
that will inundate coastal areas all over the world, making the Arctic the
linchpin in our global climate system. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FHmchvkz4NzI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHmchvkz4NzI&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FHmchvkz4NzI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p><b>GLOBAL WARNING</b></p>
<p>1.  Average global sea level reached a record high in 2012, 3.5
centimeters above the 1993 to 2010 average.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/993705/files/20141107035606-_8AW0155.jpg?1415361366"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>2.  Arctic ice levels reached record lows in 2012. The six lowest
September ice extents have occurred in the last six years, and September 2012
holds the lowest ice extent on record.</p>
<p>3.  2012 brought the world's highest levels of greenhouse gases
released by the burning of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>4.  2012 was among the top 10 years on record for the highest global
land and surface temperatures since modern data collection began.</p>
<p>5.  Surface temperatures in the Arctic are increasing at a rate
about two times faster than the rest of the world.</p>
<p>6.  The amount of carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels
hit new highs; for the first time, in Spring 2012, the atmospheric CO2
concentration exceeded 400 parts per million (ppm) at seven of the 13 Arctic
observation sites.</p>
<p>7.  Evidence from lake sediments, tree-rings and ice cores suggest
that temperatures in recent decades have been higher than at any time in the
past 2,000 years.</p>
<p>8.  The ice that forms over the Arctic sea is shrinking so rapidly
that it is predicted to melt away by the summer of 2015.</p>
<p>9.  In the Arctic, precipitation is increasingly falling as rain
during the winter months.</p>
<p>10. Due to the unprecedented loss of Arctic sea ice, 2/3 of the world’s
polar bear population could be gone by 2050.</p>
<p><b>CONSEQUENCES -</b>Arctic sea ice is melting so fast that scientists are having a difficult
time keeping pace with its disappearance. We must understand the specific
processes that are causing this rapid loss of sea ice so that we can better
predict the environmental changes that will occur and the ramifications of
these transformations for not just the Arctic, but the rest of our planet as
well. What we do know without any doubt is that the massive floating ice sheet
of the Arctic Ocean is being lost at an increasingly fast pace as a result of
anthropogenic climate change.  There is a natural expansion and
contraction of Arctic sea ice due to seasonal changes, but with an ever-warming
climate, sea ice has been steadily declining in both surface extent and
thickness on an annual basis. According to the National Snow and Ice Data
Center (NSIDC), 2012 saw the smallest and thinnest ice cover ever reported in
the Arctic Ocean, a mere 51% of the average sea ice extent and only 20% of the
average volume from 1979. The disappearance of this much ice is particularly
disturbing because of the prominent role Arctic sea ice has in regulating
Earth’s climate.</p>
<p>Many globally significant populations of animals can be found in the
Arctic, including over half of the world's shorebird species, 80% of goose
populations, several million reindeer, beluga whales and narwhals. Sea ice is
an important element in the Arctic ecosystem for many species, from bacteria
and unicellular algae on the underside of the ice to large mammals such as the
polar bear and ringed seals. Sea ice is akin to an upside down coral reef; over
1000 species of ice algae that live in direct association with Arctic sea ice
require its presence for survival. Ice algae along with some species of sub-ice
phytoplankton are essential food sources for many animals and their survival
and proliferation are paramount to a healthy food web. Copepods, amphipods, and
other lipid-rich herbivorous zooplankton are uniquely adapted to eat these
primary producers. All of these co-dependent species will be adversely affected
by the loss of sea ice. Many species of animals including seabirds, whales, and
Arctic fishes will have trouble keeping themselves fed without a proliferation
of these fatty crustaceans and will suffer as populations of ice-associated
zooplankton diminish along with the sea ice.</p>
<p>Shrinking sea ice is a major problem for Arctic marine mammals not just
because their sources of food will diminish, but because these animals are
fundamentally reliant on sea ice for many essential aspects of their lives
including hunting, reproducing, and raising their young. The most well-known
mammal suffering from the loss of Arctic sea ice is the polar bear. Their
primary prey items are ice-dependent seals and with the ice thinning and being
absent for more of the year, the polar bears’ hunting season has been
shortened. This results in thinner bears, declining reproductive rates, and
increasing cub mortality. It is projected that we will lose two-thirds of the
world’s polar bears by 2050.</p>
<p>Vanishing sea ice is just the beginning of an imminent climate crisis and
is an indication that we need to act now in order to prevent further
irreparable damage to our planet. We must act together on a global scale to
drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions quickly and permanently. It is not
too late to re imagine our future, but our window of opportunity to incite these
critical changes is closing as rapidly as our arctic sea ice is melting.</p><p>

<br/></div>","ELYSIUM ARTISTS FOR
THE ARCTIC is a project that combines the expertise of some of the world’s top
scientists, artists, and explorers to create a multi-faceted interpretation of
the Arctic. Artists for the Arctic hopes to inspire greater appreciation,
understanding, and love for this critically important part of our planet, while
drawing attention to the impacts of climate change. This icy ecosystem is
regarded as one of the most enchanting wilderness regions of our planet, yet
volatile and under severe threat from the warming of the world’s climate. This
expedition promises to deliver the most awe-inspiring and stunning visual
representation ever seen of the Arctic. The sights, sounds, and science
captured by the Elysium Team will inspire ways to preserve and protect life at
the top of the world through art, education, and outreach. 
The Elysium – Artists for the Arctic is a Save
Our Seas Fund project by Ocean Geographic, a society managed by
OceanNEnvironment Ltd, a non-governmental charity status organization registered with Environment
Australia. OceanGeographic.org 
THE MISSION: The Explorer Team’s mission is to encapsulate the splendor of the Arctic
through the sights and sounds of this enthralling region, into one exquisite
volume, a film and exhibitions around the world in eight major cities in
2016-2017. Elysium's science team will record and study the impacts of
disappearing sea ice in the Arctic, inspiring, educating, and engaging the
public about the wonders of the Arctic and its importance to our global
climate. Through cross-cultural dialogue and educational outreach programs,
Artists for the Arctic aims to exchange knowledge with Inuit groups and Elders
about their home and the animals that live there. These first-hand accounts
will be broadcast through a series of exhibitions worldwide, global social
networks, and media channels, inspiring conservation for the diverse life of
the Arctic as well as drawing attention to the impacts of climate change, ocean
change, and disappearing sea ice. Only with your support will we be able
to spread this critical message around the globe. You can have a direct impact
on the way the world sees and understands the Arctic, and consequently on how
we protect this precious polar region in the near future.

THE VISION: For millennia, a thick layer of sea ice has covered much of the Arctic
and Greenland oceans. Serving as a reflective cap on the ocean, the sea ice
reflects sunlight back into the atmosphere, insulating polar locales and
maintaining lower global temperatures in the process.  Arctic sea ice is
our planet’s air conditioning system and has been regulating Earth’s climate
for millions of years.
The Arctic
is warming, acidifying, and changing faster than any other place on Earth,
making its inhabitants incredibly vulnerable and in need of attention. The
Elysium Artists for the Arctic project’s diverse artistic interpretation and
educational outreach program shall deliver much-needed ocean education,
inspiring arctic conservation and education for citizens of the world,
especially youths. After the expedition, the Elysium Artists for the Arctic
project will have the resources to generate memorable, hands-on learning
experiences that can be shared worldwide. 
The Elysium
Arctic explorers are each committed to using their expertise to increase
worldwide understanding of ocean change as a key element of climate change. The
explorers will take on the personal responsibility of achieving that goal by
creating an unparalleled artistic portrait and crucial scientific index of the
current conditions in the Arctic as climate change begins to take a toll on the
region. The explorers hope the fruits of their efforts will bring the plight of
this crucial region to the attention of the world, inspire action to fight
climate change, yield vital benchmark data for measuring the future effects of
Arctic warming, and will comprise a magnificent collection of sights, sounds,
and information to be treasured by future generations.
We believe
the Arctic can be saved. We truly believe a small group of people can change
the world, and this imaging epic must inspire, invigorate, and serve as a call
for action to ensure the survival of artic keystone species and ultimately our
very own future on planet Earth. If you are a naturalist, scientist,
photographer, artist, or musician, consider securing YOUR LEGACY in the
Elysium Artists for the Arctic project by using your talent to inspire others
to better understand and care for our beautiful blue marble.
“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can
change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.” –Margaret Mead

STRATEGIES: Elysium’s professional science team is headed by Mission Blue founder
Sylvia Earle PhD and Cabel Davis PhD of the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution. Drs. Earle and Davis and the other science team members will
deploy specialized oceanographic equipment including plankton nets, a remotely
operated vehicle (ROV),  and the video plankton recorder (VPR) to collect
data documenting ocean change in the Arctic. During the expedition, the VPR,
sampling nets, and ROV will be deployed several times to collect biological
samples as well as capture video and still images.The Elysium’s science team
also plans to engage Inuit communities in educational programs aimed at
increasing awareness of ocean biodiversity and the impacts of climate change in
the Greenlandic Arctic. Aboard the expedition vessel, guests from each
community will have the opportunity to see and participate in citizen science
in action. 
Susan R. Eaton, the expedition geologist and science journalist, will
manage Elysium's “Bringing the Ocean to Eye Level,” an innovative ocean
educational outreach program designed to provide Elysium’s Greenland Inuit
guests with a platform to share their valued local knowledge and traditions,
contributing to a broader body of scientific knowledge about the Arctic. In
parallel, Elysium’s artists will interact with their Inuit counterparts,
contributing to a cross-cultural exchange that’s focused on the arts and
culture. Employing the Elysium’s social networks and media coverage, the Inuit
and local peoples will have the opportunity to reach out to people around the
globe. 
Elysium's Artistic team is comprised of photographers, cinematographers,
musicians, fine artists, and modern artists who are tasked with producing
images and sounds of the Arctic in their respective interpretations of this
region of immense beauty.
On
board the expedition platform or support zodiac, the live feed from the ROV
inspection camera will feed directly into a laptop. For observational science
the ROV will be capable of moving underneath and around sea ice. Data collected
during the expedition will be made available to the OpenROV community, Google
Ocean, and WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) and to school children all
over the world, including students living in the Arctic. Elysium will connect to
the world before, during, and after the expedition via blogs, tweets, videos,
media interviews, magazine articles, and other outreach materials.
The
71.61m MV Polar Pioneer also known as the Akademik Schuleykin (Академик Шулейкин),
has been specially chartered for this expedition. Built in Finland in 1982 this
71.61m is an ice-strengthened research ship. For the Elysium expedition, this
vessel will also be supported by six zodiacs. The Polar Pioneer will
be equipped with remote operated vehicles (ROV), video plankton recorder
(VPR) plus plankton sampling equipment. 
Elysium Artists for the Arctic is a carbon neutral expedition funded by
Ocean Geographic Society.

WHAT WE NEED: We need to maximize our time in the Arctic, and
what we can accomplish will directly depend on how much money is raised in the
next 2 months. Our goal for this campaign is to raise $350,000.  
We projected $80, 000 to bring in specialized scientific
equipment: Open source ROVs with HD cameras, temperature and salinity instruments,
mobile aquarium and scientist to bring in the video plankton recorder,
laboratory and plankton sampling equipment. We'll need $85,000 to create
and produce the Elysium limited edition book and movie, $25,000 for the Elysium
Arctic Report,  $20,000 to produce the full soundtrack, and $150,000 to
transport and curate exhibition for eight cities. 

WHAT WE WILL DO:  Elysium Science - with a specialised
scientific team and equipment, the Elysium team will engage an educational
outreach program utilizing mobile aquariums and tethered ROVs equipped with HD
video cameras and instrumentation, to a couple of isolated Inuit hamlets in
northeastern Greenland.
With scientific research capturing data, samples,
photographic documentation, an in-depth Elysium Art and Science
Expedition Report will be published for distribution to  schools and
universities at eight major cities and available for download and shared free
of charge.
A fine art limited edition book titled “Artists
for the Arctic” will also be produced for collectors and expedition
sponsors. This book shall be dedicated to Sir George Hubert Wilkins -
the last of the Polar explorer who first discovered that the Arctic and
Antarctic as the climate engine of our planet. This benchmark production shall
feature images and artwork from the expedition artistic team comprised of some
of the world’s most influential conservation artists, musicians, and 
photographers. While the expedition report  is designed to educate, this
fine art production aims to inspire a greater appreciation of the Arctic and
concern about danger of climate change.
Expedition members Eric Bettens (composer) and Alex Rose (Assistant
Project Director/violinist) shall compose and perform the original
soundtrack music of “Artists for the Arctic.” A CD and electronic
version shall be published and released in conjunction with the limited edition
book.
A feature length documentary shall also be
produced, sharing Elysium's first-hand account of the splendour and plights of
the Arctic through the context of the expedition and the perspectives of the
explorer members.
In 2016 to 2017, a series of “Artists for the
Arctic” exhibition will be launched around the world in eight
principal cites: Sydney, Singapore, Shanghai, Manila, Los Angeles,
Oslo, London and New York. The Elysium Arctic exhibition is designed
as a première for the movie and book to reach out to a greater audience
inspiring greater preservation of the polar region and the danger of rising
global temperature. 

THE
DECLARATION: This declaration affirms that the Elysium Artists for the Arctic Epic
Expedition is more than just an exploration event. It is a commitment by the
team of explorers to a greater goal beyond the adrenalin rush of a challenging
adventure. This Elysium Epic Expedition is a continuation of our ongoing
commitment to inspire and enlighten the general public and government
decision-makers around the world, and to motivate everyone to take essential
actions to restore the health of our planet. Elysium Epic’s Manifesto – A
Call for a Change in Attitude Toward Our Oceans.
WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT THE ARCTIC?
1.  Arctic sea ice is our planet’s air conditioning system and has
been regulating Earth’s climate for millions of years.
2.  The Arctic Ocean and the seas that surround it are extremely
diverse and contain a wide range of unique life.
3.  There are over 1000 species of ice algae, primary producers that
inhabit the underside of the sea ice, that form the foundation of the Arctic
Ocean food web upon which all other marine life depends.
4.  Many species of fish, birds, and marine mammals are directly
dependent upon the presence of arctic sea ice, and consequently a cold enough
Arctic, in order to survive.
5.  Indigenous peoples still lead subsistence lifestyles in the
Arctic and heavily depend on stable conditions and reliable food sources to
maintain their traditional culture.
6.  Climate in the Arctic directly affects weather patterns, storms
in particular, all over the planet.
7.  Frozen ground sequesters vast amounts of carbon, all of which
will be released as permafrost thaws with warming temperatures.
8.  Subsea permafrost also stores huge amounts of carbon in the form
of frozen organic matter that could be released as the Arctic warms.
9.  The Arctic is warming, acidifying, and changing faster than any
other place on Earth, making its inhabitants incredibly vulnerable and in need
of protection.
10. Unprecedented losses of Arctic sea ice will lead to sea level rise
that will inundate coastal areas all over the world, making the Arctic the
linchpin in our global climate system. 
GLOBAL WARNING
1.  Average global sea level reached a record high in 2012, 3.5
centimeters above the 1993 to 2010 average.
2.  Arctic ice levels reached record lows in 2012. The six lowest
September ice extents have occurred in the last six years, and September 2012
holds the lowest ice extent on record.
3.  2012 brought the world's highest levels of greenhouse gases
released by the burning of fossil fuels.
4.  2012 was among the top 10 years on record for the highest global
land and surface temperatures since modern data collection began.
5.  Surface temperatures in the Arctic are increasing at a rate
about two times faster than the rest of the world.
6.  The amount of carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels
hit new highs; for the first time, in Spring 2012, the atmospheric CO2
concentration exceeded 400 parts per million (ppm) at seven of the 13 Arctic
observation sites.
7.  Evidence from lake sediments, tree-rings and ice cores suggest
that temperatures in recent decades have been higher than at any time in the
past 2,000 years.
8.  The ice that forms over the Arctic sea is shrinking so rapidly
that it is predicted to melt away by the summer of 2015.
9.  In the Arctic, precipitation is increasingly falling as rain
during the winter months.
10. Due to the unprecedented loss of Arctic sea ice, 2/3 of the world’s
polar bear population could be gone by 2050.
CONSEQUENCES -Arctic sea ice is melting so fast that scientists are having a difficult
time keeping pace with its disappearance. We must understand the specific
processes that are causing this rapid loss of sea ice so that we can better
predict the environmental changes that will occur and the ramifications of
these transformations for not just the Arctic, but the rest of our planet as
well. What we do know without any doubt is that the massive floating ice sheet
of the Arctic Ocean is being lost at an increasingly fast pace as a result of
anthropogenic climate change.  There is a natural expansion and
contraction of Arctic sea ice due to seasonal changes, but with an ever-warming
climate, sea ice has been steadily declining in both surface extent and
thickness on an annual basis. According to the National Snow and Ice Data
Center (NSIDC), 2012 saw the smallest and thinnest ice cover ever reported in
the Arctic Ocean, a mere 51% of the average sea ice extent and only 20% of the
average volume from 1979. The disappearance of this much ice is particularly
disturbing because of the prominent role Arctic sea ice has in regulating
Earth’s climate.
Many globally significant populations of animals can be found in the
Arctic, including over half of the world's shorebird species, 80% of goose
populations, several million reindeer, beluga whales and narwhals. Sea ice is
an important element in the Arctic ecosystem for many species, from bacteria
and unicellular algae on the underside of the ice to large mammals such as the
polar bear and ringed seals. Sea ice is akin to an upside down coral reef; over
1000 species of ice algae that live in direct association with Arctic sea ice
require its presence for survival. Ice algae along with some species of sub-ice
phytoplankton are essential food sources for many animals and their survival
and proliferation are paramount to a healthy food web. Copepods, amphipods, and
other lipid-rich herbivorous zooplankton are uniquely adapted to eat these
primary producers. All of these co-dependent species will be adversely affected
by the loss of sea ice. Many species of animals including seabirds, whales, and
Arctic fishes will have trouble keeping themselves fed without a proliferation
of these fatty crustaceans and will suffer as populations of ice-associated
zooplankton diminish along with the sea ice.
Shrinking sea ice is a major problem for Arctic marine mammals not just
because their sources of food will diminish, but because these animals are
fundamentally reliant on sea ice for many essential aspects of their lives
including hunting, reproducing, and raising their young. The most well-known
mammal suffering from the loss of Arctic sea ice is the polar bear. Their
primary prey items are ice-dependent seals and with the ice thinning and being
absent for more of the year, the polar bears’ hunting season has been
shortened. This results in thinner bears, declining reproductive rates, and
increasing cub mortality. It is projected that we will lose two-thirds of the
world’s polar bears by 2050.
Vanishing sea ice is just the beginning of an imminent climate crisis and
is an indication that we need to act now in order to prevent further
irreparable damage to our planet. We must act together on a global scale to
drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions quickly and permanently. It is not
too late to re imagine our future, but our window of opportunity to incite these
critical changes is closing as rapidly as our arctic sea ice is melting.

<p><strong>HELP TELL DELTA AIR LINES AND THE PORT AUTHORITY TO STOP DEMOLISHING HISTORY!</strong></p>
<p><strong>For over two years, our campaign has sought to save the iconic Worldport – pushing for the historic flying saucer-shaped terminal to be preserved, restored, re-purposed and operated for revenue-generating aviation or non-aviation public uses. <br/><br/>We are only asking to save the historic saucer section, whose four-acre roof and less than two-acre footprint take up very little of the 48-acre terminal property. The rear extension of the terminal can still be demolished to provide adequate aircraft staging and parking area as per the existing redevelopment plan!</strong></p>
<p><strong>On June 19, 2013, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave us our biggest boost yet, placing the Worldport on its list of America’s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. This was a significant victory for our cause, as the Trust agrees wholeheartedly with our arguments for preservation, which include the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This magnificent structure is a striking example of Mid-Century Modern design and function that deserves to be saved, restored and re-used – preserving the unique character of JFK International Airport from a bygone era while still serving as a viable airport terminal or for other services.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Opened in May 1960 as the home of legendary Pan American World Airways, the Worldport still serves as a showcase for Jet Age International travel – and still embodies the excitement of exploring an ever shrinking world – a purpose which it can easily continue to serve!<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>The structure has seen more than its fair share of history, welcoming historic figures of all stripes: everyone from the Beatles to Martin Luther King Jr. to Winston Churchill has passed underneath its iconic cantilevered roof.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>As with the TWA Flight Center, the Worldport has served as the visible face of JFK International Airport for many years, and it has been featured in countless movies, television shows, and newspaper and magazine stories. Its loss would mean the permanent alteration of the New York landscape.</li>
</ul><p><strong>WE NEED YOUR HELP FOR THE FINAL PUSH TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF AN IRREPLACEABLE JET AGE ICON!</strong></p>
<p>Even as we mobilize for this final push, the building is fighting for its life. Demolition equipment has been moved to the location, and some exploratory work on abating hazardous materials in the structure has begun to take its toll.<br/><strong><br/>But some of this abatement work on the structure would be needed for a restoration – so the end is not yet here.</strong>  There is still some time – but we need as much support and attention as possible to push this campaign over the top and convince Delta Air Lines and the Port Authority that the public wants to see this building stay.</p>
<p><strong>Now is the time to concentrate all efforts and unleash the power of the public’s imagination.</strong></p>
<p><strong>TO THIS END, WE HAVE DECIDED TO RUN A CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN WITH THE GOAL OF RAISING SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO PUBLISH AN ILLUSTRATED AD IN THE NEW YORK TIMES.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Given the recent surge in media attention to our cause,  we believe our best approach is to focus solely on drawing additional media and public attention. We believe that the time is right to ride the crest of a growing wave – but we need your help to do it.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to raise sufficient contributions through crowdfunding to place an illustrated ad in the New York Times, informing the general public of what's happening, and why the building should be saved.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>The ad will draw attention to the ongoing demolition, and argue that Delta and the Port Authority can find a “better way” that will not only benefit historic preservation, but will provide the airline with a marquis symbol of their presence in the New York area.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>The ad will urge the general public to take action to contact Delta Air Lines and the Port Authority and tell them to stop further demolition of the building.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>If our funding goal is exceeded, we will invest in further advertising. If our funding goal is not reached by the end of the fundraising campaign, all contributions will go towards less expensive advertising. And finally - ff we really fall short, under $2500, we will refund your contribution.</li>
</ul><p><strong><strong>As a historic testament of our efforts to save this magnificient building and for preservation efforts around the globe, we will run the ad whether the building stands or falls.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>EVEN IF YOU CAN'T CONTRIBUTE, YOU CAN STILL HELP!</strong></p>
<p>Join our campaign via Facebook and Twitter and get involved with letter-writing and social media promotions to help us spread the word! Anytime you reach out to friends, fellow aviation enthusiasts, or even family – you are helping to build the crescendo to preserve this unique and irreplaceable icon.</p>

The ad was published and appeared in the New York Times page A18 on July 19, 2013. Sincerest thanks to everyone who contributed. Even though we did not meet our goal, we did earn enough to:
1) Publish a press release on July 10, 2013 ($1360 + $195 fee)
2) Publish a 1/8th page New York Times ad on July 19. 2013 ($5580)
Out of the $7628 we raised, our net after Indiegogo platform and credit card fees was $6692.95.

_____________________________________________
HELP TELL DELTA AIR LINES AND THE PORT AUTHORITY TO STOP DEMOLISHING HISTORY!
For over two years, our campaign has sought to save the iconic Worldport – pushing for the historic flying saucer-shaped terminal to be preserved, restored, re-purposed and operated for revenue-generating aviation or non-aviation public uses. We are only asking to save the historic saucer section, whose four-acre roof and less than two-acre footprint take up very little of the 48-acre terminal property. The rear extension of the terminal can still be demolished to provide adequate aircraft staging and parking area as per the existing redevelopment plan!
On June 19, 2013, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave us our biggest boost yet, placing the Worldport on its list of America’s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. This was a significant victory for our cause, as the Trust agrees wholeheartedly with our arguments for preservation, which include the following:

This magnificent structure is a striking example of Mid-Century Modern design and function that deserves to be saved, restored and re-used – preserving the unique character of JFK International Airport from a bygone era while still serving as a viable airport terminal or for other services.

Opened in May 1960 as the home of legendary Pan American World Airways, the Worldport still serves as a showcase for Jet Age International travel – and still embodies the excitement of exploring an ever shrinking world – a purpose which it can easily continue to serve!

The structure has seen more than its fair share of history, welcoming historic figures of all stripes: everyone from the Beatles to Martin Luther King Jr. to Winston Churchill has passed underneath its iconic cantilevered roof.

As with the TWA Flight Center, the Worldport has served as the visible face of JFK International Airport for many years, and it has been featured in countless movies, television shows, and newspaper and magazine stories. Its loss would mean the permanent alteration of the New York landscape.
WE NEED YOUR HELP FOR THE FINAL PUSH TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF AN IRREPLACEABLE JET AGE ICON!
Even as we mobilize for this final push, the building is fighting for its life. Demolition equipment has been moved to the location, and some exploratory work on abating hazardous materials in the structure has begun to take its toll.But some of this abatement work on the structure would be needed for a restoration – so the end is not yet here.  There is still some time – but we need as much support and attention as possible to push this campaign over the top and convince Delta Air Lines and the Port Authority that the public wants to see this building stay.
Now is the time to concentrate all efforts and unleash the power of the public’s imagination.
TO THIS END, WE HAVE DECIDED TO RUN A CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN WITH THE GOAL OF RAISING SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO PUBLISH AN ILLUSTRATED AD IN THE NEW YORK TIMES.
Given the recent surge in media attention to our cause,  we believe our best approach is to focus solely on drawing additional media and public attention. We believe that the time is right to ride the crest of a growing wave – but we need your help to do it.

Our goal is to raise sufficient contributions through crowdfunding to place an illustrated ad in the New York Times, informing the general public of what's happening, and why the building should be saved.

The ad will draw attention to the ongoing demolition, and argue that Delta and the Port Authority can find a “better way” that will not only benefit historic preservation, but will provide the airline with a marquis symbol of their presence in the New York area.

The ad will urge the general public to take action to contact Delta Air Lines and the Port Authority and tell them to stop further demolition of the building.

If our funding goal is exceeded, we will invest in further advertising. If our funding goal is not reached by the end of the fundraising campaign, all contributions will go towards less expensive advertising. And finally - ff we really fall short, under $2500, we will refund your contribution.
As a historic testament of our efforts to save this magnificient building and for preservation efforts around the globe, we will run the ad whether the building stands or falls.
EVEN IF YOU CAN'T CONTRIBUTE, YOU CAN STILL HELP!
Join our campaign via Facebook and Twitter and get involved with letter-writing and social media promotions to help us spread the word! Anytime you reach out to friends, fellow aviation enthusiasts, or even family – you are helping to build the crescendo to preserve this unique and irreplaceable icon.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We at PlasticNotSoFantastic are one of the only global plastic pollution campaigns which focus on land based plastic pollution, rather than marine based plastic pollution.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""Gastric Lith"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.pnsfexpedition.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Ulle-and-gastriclith.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Gastric Lith""/></p>
<p>Shown above is the post mortem room at the <a href=""http://www.cvrl.ae/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Central Veterinary Research Laboratory</a> (“CVRL”) in Dubai, where Dr. Dr. habil Ulrich Wernery (Dr. Ulli), is the Scientific Director (pictured).</p>
<p>He is holding an accumulation of rope and plastic in his right hand and a gastriclith (<em>gastric</em> meaning <em>relating to the stomach</em>, and <em>lith</em> meaning <em>stone</em>) is his left hand.  Both were extracted from the remains of the camel laid out on the operating table behind him.</p>
<p>The jumbled mass of plastic and rope is a precursor to the gastriclith, which takes time to calcify in the animal’s stomach, eventually resulting in the animal starving to death.  Dr. Ulli has found gastricliths weighing up to 58 kilograms.</p>
<p>Finding such accumulations of plastic waste in the digestive systems of animals on which he operates is unfortunately no longer an unusual occurrence.  As a result, Dr. Ulli coined the term “Fatal Pollution” to describe this type of pollution, which is primarily plastic based, and we founded the PlasticNotSoFantastic (PNSF) campaign in order to spread the Fatal Pollution message to the widest possible audience.</p>
<p><img alt=""Gastric Lith in a Cow"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.pnsfexpedition.com/wp-content/Cimy_Header_Images/1_sm.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Gastric Lith in a Cow""/></p>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong></p>
<p>While the ingestion of pure plastic is relatively harmless from a toxicity perspective, as shown above, the accumulation of plastic waste in an animal’s stomach has fatal consequences.  The death of productive animals, such as goats, cows and camels, has an immediate economic impact for the owner and the community.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are a vast range of chemicals which are added to plastics, in order to achieve malleability, temperature resistance, texture and colour changes.  These chemicals can leach from the plastic into the consuming animal.  It is for this reason that plastic pollution is fatal not only to the animals which directly forage on the plastic waste, but also for us humans who consume the meat and milk from contaminated animals.</p>
<p><strong>Spreading the word</strong></p>
<p>Our passion is the great outdoors. We love to discover new places, but unfortunately we have encountered all too often the destructive effects of plastic pollution in the most remote corners of the globe.</p>
<p>Thus the idea came to combine the two – a great journey with a great cause. The PlasticNotSoFantastic Expedition was born… </p>
<p>The PNSF Expedition is a global road trip, with Stage 1 stretching from the United Arab Emirates to Norway and back again.  We will be leaving the UAE on the 24th April 2012 and intend to return to the UAE at the end of September 2012.</p>
<p>The PNSF campaign is endorsed by UNESCO Arab Region, the Plastic Pollution Coalition, the Emirates Marine Environmental Group, Project Kaisei, Tangaroa Blue, Ocean Voyages Institute, Plastic Oceans and Goumbook.  </p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>The PNSF Expedition is primarily privately funded.  Our budget for the Expedition has had to include costs such as car insurance (USD 3,000), Carnet de Passage (deposit of USD 18,000), ferries and visas (USD 2,500), private health insurance and numerous other small and large expenses.    Fuel will also be a big cost element in Europe, and we will therefore be converting the car to run on Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) as well as normal petrol.  This will cost us in the region of USD 3,500.  We will be camping in our roof top tent wherever possible and therefore we can save on hotel bills.</p>
<p>However, we have limited private resources, and we are therefore offering corporate sponsorship opportunities.  We are also in need of photographic and audio visual equipment, with which we intend to more effectively document instances of plastic pollution on our route.  We will be undertaking regular presentations, seminars and workshops at schools, universities and Rotary Clubs and therefore a projector would also be helpful.</p>
<p>Camcorder such as the JVC GY-HM100U (USD 2,995), Sony's HXR-MC2000U (USD 1,699) or Sony's HVR-Z7U (USD 5,999)</p>
<p>Lavalier microphone such as Sony's UWPV1/4244 (USD 575)</p>

<p>The data we gather will be placed on the World Waste Map - a global initiative run by Let's Do It World to map illegally dumped waste.  Our data can later be used as a resource to arrange local cleanups.  </p>
<p>We also intend to produce a photographic collage of the Expedition, which we will use in our almost daily school events in the UAE.</p>
<p>The photographs, interviews and data collected will also be provided to our various endorsers, who may then use the material in further raising awareness of the issues surrounding plastic pollution.  </p>

Because of the recent urgency in critical climate changes, I was asked to speak at the upcoming 2013 ""Sustainable Brands"" Summit at the World Brand Congress in India this October and need your support to attend.
As carbon just reaches 400 ppm in the atmosphere (which has neverhappened before in human history) and the world is transforming and changing atan alarming rate, we are running out of time to get the “green” message out to thebusiness community.  
Because of my long-term commitment to the environment and my position at the U.S. Green Chamber of Commerce, I have been asked to speak at the upcoming summit in Mumbai, India. This invitation to present just came in and was not included in our 2013 budget, so the U.S. Green Chamber, as a non-profit organization,  is unable to sponsor the travel costs to this event.
The World Brand Congress will be the single largest meeting of the International community’s most successful and sought after brand marketing experts.  This is an opportunity to promote the “Green Economy” and sustainability on a global platform. 
Why is This Important?
This is a unique opportunity to affect change on a global level and impact the environmental movement. At the summit, I can influence leaders from around the world about the important steps we all must take to make a sustainable future for generations to come. I am traveling to this conference to share this important message to some of the key international ""messengers"".
The world is watching America in how we manage our resources on a business level and we have the opportunity and the responsibility to be the leaders and show that we a moving in a new direction.
What We Need & What You Get
I need at least $2,300 dollars to cover my remainingtravel expenses including Airfare, Visa, Insurance, carbon offsets,and lodging.  The airline ticket itself is between $1,200 and $1,500. The WorldBrand Congress will be covering 3 nights hotel and all conference expenses.
I am very excited to offer unique items to my contributors! 

For only $25, I will personally send you a very cool postcard from India.
 For only $45, you will receive the cool postcard and public acknowledgement on the U.S. Green Chamber of Commerce Facebook page and the U.S. Green Chamber of   Commerce Southeast region Facebook page. 
For only $100, you will receive the above plus be invited to a private Indian themed reception following my business trip. We will provide Indian appetizers     and beverages along with a short and fun presentation on the next steps to     global sustainability.  

For $500 you will receive all of the above, four tickets to evening reception and     a special hand picked sovenier from India.
For the generous contribution of $950 you will receive all of the above plus     your own table at the reception and your own personal attendant for the evening.

The Impact
The sooner we engage the global business community in a collaborative manner, thesooner we can:

Reduce the impact we are having on the environment  Promote sustainable and green business practices Save the environment for future generations

access to
mobile media devices is increasing day by day. As a result parents now
tend to use digital devices as quick-shift babysitters. The time
children spend in front of a display screen of some sort is increasing
rapidly as well. However, apart from keeping them busy this passive and
non-active screen time alone will not aid in their brain development.</big></p>

kids,

increasing
usage of
digital devices among children has led to a decline in the time they

offer.</big></p>

Children’s
access to
mobile media devices is increasing day by day. As a result parents now
tend to use digital devices as quick-shift babysitters. The time
children spend in front of a display screen of some sort is increasing
rapidly as well. However, apart from keeping them busy this passive and
non-active screen time alone will not aid in their brain development.
It
is
imperative for
kids,
particularly in their early ages to play with toys. Active play
involving pretend-play and imaginative-play is a major part of healthy
brain development as often stressed by child psychology experts.
The
increasing
usage of
digital devices among children has led to a decline in the time they
spend playing with actual toys. Restricting access to digital devices,
however, would limit the opportunities kids get to experience the
valuable and positive impact that cutting edge, innovative technologies
offer.
We
at
Kreyonic,
encourage physical play in kids without restricting their access to
technology. With the use of actual toys, our products can make screen
time more meaningful and fun for children.

Qboo
is a set
of farm animals from the magical farm land far
far away,
made of fabric (plush toys), and they come bundled with an interactive
educational tablet application. 
Children
can
place toys on the tablet screen and the application
presents a variety of creative activities based on the type of toy.

  



By
playing with Qboo, kids can reveal the secret magical world
of animals, fun facts and their whereabouts.
This is how the perfected toys
and characters would look like in the final production design.




Playing
with
Qboo is easy and fun!
Open
the Qboo
application on your tablet and place a toy on the
screen. Thats it!




Qboo
application encourages non-structured, open-ended game play. Children
can choose the characters they want in their story. Characters
come to life in the digital world. They listen and respond to children.
Qboo's
open-ended game play allows kids to control the flow
of the game/stories based on their own imagination. So
every time kids play they will experience a different flow in the same
story!
Our
main
goal is to encourage kids to play more often with
real toys. With Qboo, even when there is no tablet around, children can
still keep playing with the toys.
It
is magic!
Well, not really.
Qboo
toys do
not have any electronics inside. Current toys are
passive and use multi-touch technology on latest capacitive sensing
tablet screens.
Each
toy has a
uniquely identifiable pattern embroidered with a
special thread; when kids place toys on the tablet screen, each toy registers a unique multitouch pattern that our patent pending design and technology can use to
recognize the type of toy being used.




Educational
Value


Playing with Qboo will help improve your child's
social,
intellectual, language, and problem-solving skills.
We encourage imaginative play and active play.
We provide interactive educational activities for kids
which
will improve hand/eye co-ordination and fine motor skills.
Qboo plush toys are a good travel companion. Have a long
boring
journey coming up? take Qboo along with you
Qboo's smart and cuddly toys provide ideal simulation for
kids
imaginations
Our toys are specially designed and supervised with the help
of
professional educators and child psychology experts.




To
Spend
Some Quality Time With Your Kids. You Can Play
Along Too!


 




Qboo T-Shirt Designs!
Kreyonic,
is
an early stage tech startup founded by a team of three
and now based in Kitchener, ON Canada.
We
are the first international team in the Communitech
Hyperdrive Accelerator program.
We
are
Software Engineers and we have expertise in Human Computer
Interaction, Child Computer Interaction, Music Technology and Image
Processing.
We
love
technology and we love KIDS!
Why
We Are
Doing This?
At
Kreyonic we
are fascinated by technology and how that can be used
to influence curious little minds.
When
we were
kids, from the very first moment that we could grab a
toy we wanted to
take it apart to see what was inside and how they worked. It was this
ongoing curiosity that led us to an interest in technology and
innovation.
We
know there
are millions of kids out there with curious, creative
and innovative minds. We are on a mission to innovate fun and
educational tools for those little minds to experience the best of
cutting edge technology without getting addicted to passive screen
times.





Parents
know the best! During our closed beta we realized how important
is the feedback from parents to improve our product and company. That
is why we created the Moms & Dads Group for Kreyonic.

The
Moms &
Dads group will be the first to get access to try out
new toys and apps and give their feedback. These parents work closely
with our team to help Kreyonic by testing new features and suggesting
improvements.







Qboo
Characters - Work in Progress






We
are
ready to go.
We
have
completed the toy designs and we have initial working
prototypes. We spent months testing prototypes with small groups of
parents and kids to make Qboo the hottest toy of next year.

Our
specialist custom plush toy manufacturing partner is ready to
complete the final production design and guide Qboo toys through
necessary toy certifications to get your smart plush toys shipped as
soon as possible.


With
your help
we can start and complete Qboo production run, create
more graphics and interactive content - magical stories - to complete
the Qboo app and start shipping Qboo packs by April 2014.




We
introduce Qboo with three toys, Tuffy, Tipsy and Paddles. After the
initial launch in April 2014, we plan to launch more toys.
We
are
intrigued with innovation and we encourage to build
your own creation. Therefore, we plan to provide a set of APIs for
creators and developers who love to invent their own applications using
our platform.
We
value
your creativity and your thoughts. We believe it is
important to let parents customize our applications to better suit
their kids. In future, you will be able to create your own custom
applications using our drag and drop interfaces to design stories and
scenarios.
At
Kreyonic,
we bring physical play to digital devices. Our vision
is to help the world to create the next generation of creative
thinkers... and this is just the beginning.
With
your
help, not only can we make this a reality, but also start
an exciting journey to innovate the next generation of
toys!


Please
help
us spread the word by sharing this campaign with your
family and friends.You might not want kids' toys right now, but sure you know someone who does. So please share this with your social circles. Let's make this happen!We would love to hear from you!You can email us at contact@kreyonic.com or call us on +1 226 338 2604

1.
When
will Qboo be available?
Qboo
is
currently in prototype phase. We will use this crowdfunding
campaign in order to raise funds towards production. Our goal is to
have Qboo ready to ship by April of 2014.




2.
Can I
get anything for this Christmas?
For
sure! If
you help us by pledging $40 or higher we
will send you a hand written, limited edition Qboo Christmas / New Year
/ Thank You Card of your choice, signed by founders and magical Qboo
characters! The card will be
illustrated by our amazing artist Isuri and if you want to send it to
someone else on your behalf, we can do that too!


3.
I want
to buy more than one Qboo pack. Do I need to add
shipping cost separately for each pack?
No.
You only
have to pay for shipping once. We will cover the cost
for the additional Qboo packs!




4.
Are the
toys safe for kids?
Yes.
The toys
will have safety certificates to make sure they are in
compliance with all toy safety standards in all countries.




5.
Are the
toys washable?
Yes,
but
recommended is surface wash only.




6.
Will the
toys damage or scratch my tablet device /
screen?
No.
This is
one of the main things many parents are concerned. We
take this extremely seriously and that is why we wanted to create a
toy, which is both kid friendly and tablet friendly.
The
toys are
completely made of fabric (plush toys) and no matter
how hard your child use it on your tablet device... Qboo toys will not
damage or scratch the tablet screen.




7.
In the
video, I saw a crack on your iPad! Did that happen
by toys?
No.
our
co-founder, Amani dropped that iPad in an airport during a
transit. :)




8.
What is
the recommended age range for Qboo?
The
recommended audience are kids from 3 to 5 years. However, we
found both younger and older kids showing interest in Qboo and toys
during our private beta testing.




9.
Does
Qboo App work on any tablet?
Our
current
prototype works on iPad. However, we plan to launch both
iOS and Android versions before we ship your Qboo in April 2014.
So,
Qboo App
works on all iPad versions and most of the Android
tablets out there!


10.
Can my kids play with Qboo toys
even without a tablet?
Yes!
At
Kreyonic, our main goal is to encourage physical play for
kids without restricting their access to technology. The toys and
stories are made carefully so that kids can continue playing with them
even there is no tablet around!
Qboo

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Millions of sharks are slaughtered each year and they end up primarily in shark's fin soup. The fins are so highly prized that these sharks are hauled onboard, their fins sliced off and thrown back into the ocean to die a slow death. In order to learn more about these creatures and to help educate people, I have actively sought out intimate time with these species. In March 2013, I will be joining the RJ Dunlap Marine Conservation Program from the University of Miami for a shark tagging expedition. The tags will allow us to study the sharks' movements in the subtropical Atlantic in order to identify ‘hot spots’ for feeding, mating, and pupping. With this knowledge, policy makers will be able to make better informed decisions that support establishing effective protection at these critical sites.</p>
<p>On a personal level, this experience will help educate my family and friends about this inhumane practice. Growing up it was common for me to eat shark's fin soup before I knew how it was harvested. I have come to realize how unique and beautiful these creatures are, and I hope my perspective will help change how we view and treat these creatures.</p>

<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your contribution will directly fund research aimed at creating a balance between human needs and shark conservation. Sharks play an integral role in maintaining the health of our marine ecosystem by keeping prey populations in check as well as removing weak and diseased animals. We live in a complex and dynamic world, inexorably linked through our oceans, which covers more than 70% of our planet's surface. Through photosynthesis, marine plants provide half the oxygen we breathe no matter where we live. The oceans also sustain us with food.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise money for at least one shark tag and name it Boise. With Boise being landlocked I hope people will appreciate the irony of a shark named Boise swimming in the ocean. <strong>For a stretch goal, if you help me raise $1M I will change my first name to Shark. With my last name being Oh, all my official documents will read Oh, Shark. How will cool will that be!</strong></p>
<p>The satellite tags cost $2500 each, which includes the use of satellites to track the sharks. Each tag provides information about the shark’s surrounding environment and its GPS location to help track and piece together each shark species’ life history and ecology. When a shark is tagged, it will be named Boise and you can track it in near real-time on the RJD website - <a href=""http://rjd.miami.edu/learning-tools/follow-sharks/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://rjd.miami.edu/learning-tools/follow-sharks/</a>.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi my names Gilbert M. Brown II, I am a student at The Communtiy School at the Opportunity Farm campus. At the school we have a project called our passages. We chose something that we are intrested in, and do a project about it. I chose to do mine on an herb garden and starting one for the school. The idea of the herb garden is to make it so that the school can save money on herbs. It will also allow future students to learn how to grow, maintain, and how to cook with the herbs that will be grown. At the moment the herbs are inside. When spring comes around the plants will be planted out side of the kitchen door for quick access to fresh herbs for the student that is cooking for that week. I would also like to build a hoop house or green house for the plants so they can be grown for longer in the season. and will be able to stay outside all year round.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding will be put into the supplies needed to build the hoop/green house for the plants. the money will aslo be used for soil, plant pots, ferilizers, and will also be used to buy seeds.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This prodject will save the school money on herbs. the school aleady has a garden where we grow tamatos, pumpkins, peppers, squash, and other foods. This garden will increase the different things that we can cook. We can also use herbs like parsley along with the tamatos and make are own sauces. The school would save money from not having to buy sauce from a store.</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can donate soil, plant pots, or even five gallon buckets can also work for plant pots.</p>

</div></div>","Care about the Karoo, its people and environment? Help us get the facts about gas drilling and fracking in Southern Africa to the communities living in the area. 
Join our campaign!After screening The High Cost of Cheap Gas  in Cape Town and Johannesburg we now need to show our award-winning film to those communities in the Karoo whose quality of life will be directly affected by gas development. We need your help for translating the film into Afrikaans.
Most communities in the Karoo speak Afrikaans. We need to translate the film so people can understand the messages it brings. You can help us get these messages out by funding the film translation and sharing this campaign with your friends and colleagues.To support this crowd-funding appeal, our team is crossing the Karoo for 
the next month, screening the film in the rustic playhouses of 
yesteryear, selling DVDs and talking to communities about gas 
drilling.  We are not charging entry, but asking people to contribute to
 this crowd-funding campaign.
Click here for a list of international write ups.  To date, 65,000 web references detail our discovery that companies are surreptitiously fracking in Botswana's famous national parks.
We have already shown the film to
thousands of people around the world and won 3 international awards since its official release in 2015:

            


Best Documentary at
Ekotopfilm/Envirofilm
Award of Merit from The
Accolade Global Film Competition
Best Documentary at the Los Angeles Independent
Film Festival
The film has also been on TV broadcasts on 50/50 and Carte Blanche and has made two appearances on
ETV.  We have  partnered with
WITS University, the University of Cape Town, The City of Cape Town, The Labia
Cinema, the Alternative Information Development Institute (AIDC) the
Environmental Monitoring Group (EMG) the Centre for Environmental Rights (CER), the South African Mountain Club, and the University of the Western Cape for screenings that drew hundreds of
people from government, civil society, industry and the potentially affected
public.  
Building on our momentum:
We can translate and edit the film into Afrikaans for 6,000 dollars.  
With the help of our fantastic partners we have organised four english film screenings in the Karoo, during which we will enlist the support of the people who come to our screenings for this crowd-funding campaign.  2,000 dollars of our goal goes towards completing this journey.  Supporters have the exciting opportunity to be involved in every step of the way as we upload  clips, interviews, photos and short messages every day, cataloging our journey. This will also allow us to investigate whether some companies have jumped the gun and started gas exploration already.
If we go beyond our goal and raise $10,000 we will also translate the film into Setswana for the people of Botswana.
If you are in the Karoo, or looking for a great way to explore this country, come and join us for a screening.
If you aren't, follow our journey through our social media on twitter: @allianceearth and @highcostofgas and our facebook page - share them with your friends. 
If we raise less than our goal all funds will go towards funding further outreach.
Here are the screenings in the Karoo this month, feel free to share these posters on your various social media outlets!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Fairies are absolutley real. And, especially, they will truly come to you if you really believe. I am Mallory and I have shared above an episode of the Chris Valentine Show! There are many shows to his series so be sure to check the rest of them out on youtube! I am fairy lover who owns three fairy books and I want to continue to believe and hopefully let fairies know that they are always welcome around me. In order to make this goal be possible, I need to raise money through my campaign right here on indiegogo! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need money to buy specialty fairy houses/accessories. Fairy houses are a definite must for me to have in order to help out fairy friends. All of the accessories and castles will be purchased online from a trusted site, Fairy Woodland. Plus fairy friends will indeed appreciate water related garden displays like nice ponds for fairies to wash up and drink water. So, to answer any concerns, all appreciated money contributions will go toward those areas mentioned. INCENTIVE: A $10 contribution will get you a personalized thank you letter by me. And maybe a tiny surprise! You never know! It will be nice!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to let you know, everyone, personally, that I appreciate all funds! Your generousity will be acknowledged because the fairies really will be happy I imagine and I will too. Also, when you were little, you saw fairy movies maybe and you may have seen Peter Pan. Well, contributing means that you really care about the imagination and you fully understand that imagination really comes to life!</p>

<p>Il 70% dei rifiuti abbandonati in mare è causato da
rifiuti provenienti dall’entroterra. Negli ultimi decenni, la contaminazione e
l’inquinamento dei mari e oceani sono cresciuti costantemente. Per invertire questa tendenza,
dobbiamo agire.</p>
<p><b>2
corridori, 400 km, 8 giorni, 1 solo obiettivo</b>: <b>pulire e raccogliere rifiuti </b>su un sentiero dalla Valle d’Aosta fino
alla Liguria. Ogni giorno, gli atleti percorreranno una media di 50 km e
raccoglieranno i rifiuti abbandonati lungo il percorso. Congiuntamente al loro
sforzo, cittadini, istituti scolastici, aziende, associazioni e pubbliche
amministrazioni saranno invitate a unirsi nelle attività di pulizia.</p>

<p>The ECUD is at its <b>2° edition</b> this year. In 2014, AICA had already organized a <b>central event in Italy</b> to enhance the
visibility of the campaign: thanks to the participation of Italy’s Ministry of
Environment, two main <b>clean up events</b>
had been organized (one in Bologna, in front of the central station and the
other one in Rome, in Piazza Vittorio Emanuele). The Environment Minister
himself, Gianluca Galletti, has taken part to these events, along with the
Secretary for Environment Barbara Degani. This helped us achieve a greater media
coverage and enhance the sensitization of citizen’s to the issue.  </p>
<p>Last year’s results? <b>400.000 people</b> involved in <b>Italy</b>,
<b>800.000 in Europe</b>. <b>21 tons of trash</b> collected in <b>Italy</b>, <b>2.600 tons in Europe</b>. </p>
<p>The <b>Keep
Clean &amp; Run</b> campaign takes our goal to a <b>higher stake</b>. Not only will we involve (again) the Ministry of
Environment and other relevant stakeholders, but we also want to involve more
citizens in the main event. Our goal is to:</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span><b>Collect as much
waste</b> as possible
over the 400 km of trail</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span><b>Increase the
media attention</b> to the issue so that as many participants as possible take part to the
ECUD, if not in the central event, by organizing events in their surroundings </p>
<p>This is why we need your help. Our motivation
and the contributions of our technical sponsors are not enough to achieve this
goal.</p>

<p>L’ECUD è alla <b>2° edizione</b>
quest'anno. Nel 2014, AICA aveva già organizzato un <b>evento centrale in Italia</b> per migliorare la visibilità della
campagna: grazie alla partecipazione del Ministero dell'Ambiente, erano stati
organizzati due principali eventi di pulizia (uno a Bologna, di fronte alla
stazione centrale e l'altra a Roma, in Piazza Vittorio Emanuele). Il ministro
dell'Ambiente stesso, Gianluca Galletti, ha preso parte a questi eventi,
insieme con il Sottosegretario per l'Ambiente Barbara Degani. Questo ci ha consentito
di raggiungere una copertura mediatica significativa e di migliorare la
sensibilizzazione dei cittadini di al problema.</p>
<p>I risultati dello scorso anno? <b>400.000

raccolti in Italia, <b>2.600 tonnellate in

<p>La campagna <b>Pulisci &amp; Corri</b>
porta il nostro obiettivo a un livello ancor più alto. Non solo coinvolgeremo nuovamente
il Ministero dell'Ambiente e altre portatori di interesse, ma vorremmo anche
coinvolgere più cittadini nell’evento centrale. Il nostro obiettivo è quello
di:</p>
<p>- <b>Raccogliere quanti più rifiuti possibili</b>
nei 400 km di percorso</p>
<p>- <b>Aumentare l'attenzione rivolta dai
media</b> al problema in modo da coinvolgere il maggior numero possibile di

70%
of marine littering is caused by trash that comes by the inner land. Over the past decades, the presence
of waste in the world’s seas and oceans has been an ever-increasing phenomenon.
In order to invert this trend, we must take action.
2 runners, 400 km, 8 days, 1 goal: cleaning
up a trail from Valle d’Aosta to Liguria from litter. Each day the athletes will cover an average of 50 km
and pick up litter that they find on their way. Along with their effort,
citizens, educational establishments, enterprises, associations and
municipalities will be invited to join the clean-up activity. 
In the frame of the EU funded LIFE
EWWR+ project  AICA (International
Association for Environmental Communication) coordinates the activities
inherent the European Clean Up Day (ECUD), a Europe-wide
annual clean-up day.
 The “Keep
Clean & Run” campaign is an additional effort that AICA wants to make
in order to boost the visibility of the issue and to increase the number of
participants to the ECUD in Europe. Only if many get involved we can really
achieve to reduce littering in nature. We need your help to make
it possible! 

(Italian version)
La campagna Pulisci e Corri

Il 70% dei rifiuti abbandonati in mare è causato da
rifiuti provenienti dall’entroterra. Negli ultimi decenni, la contaminazione e
l’inquinamento dei mari e oceani sono cresciuti costantemente. Per invertire questa tendenza,
dobbiamo agire.
2
corridori, 400 km, 8 giorni, 1 solo obiettivo: pulire e raccogliere rifiuti su un sentiero dalla Valle d’Aosta fino
alla Liguria. Ogni giorno, gli atleti percorreranno una media di 50 km e
raccoglieranno i rifiuti abbandonati lungo il percorso. Congiuntamente al loro
sforzo, cittadini, istituti scolastici, aziende, associazioni e pubbliche
amministrazioni saranno invitate a unirsi nelle attività di pulizia.
Nell’ambito del progetto LIFE EWWR+, finanziato
dalla UE, AICA (Associazione Internazionale per la Comunicazione Ambientale)
coordina le attività inerenti all’European
Clean Up Day (ECUD), una giornata annuale europea di pulizia straordinaria
del territorio.
La campagna “Pulisci
e Corri” è uno sforzo aggiuntivo che AICA intende realizzare per accentuare
la visibilità mediatica dell’attività incrementando così il numero di
partecipanti all’ECUD in Europa. Solo se ci facciamo coinvolgere in molti
riusciremo a ridurre l’abbandono dei rifiuti in natura. Abbiamo bisogno del
vostro aiuto e della vostra partecipazione!

800.000 in Europe. 21 tons of trash collected in Italy, 2.600 tons in Europe. 
The Keep
Clean & Run campaign takes our goal to a higher stake. Not only will we involve (again) the Ministry of
Environment and other relevant stakeholders, but we also want to involve more
citizens in the main event. Our goal is to:
- 
Collect as much
waste as possible
over the 400 km of trail
- 
Increase the
media attention to the issue so that as many participants as possible take part to the
ECUD, if not in the central event, by organizing events in their surroundings 
This is why we need your help. Our motivation
and the contributions of our technical sponsors are not enough to achieve this
goal.

(Italian version)
L’ECUD è alla 2° edizione
quest'anno. Nel 2014, AICA aveva già organizzato un evento centrale in Italia per migliorare la visibilità della
campagna: grazie alla partecipazione del Ministero dell'Ambiente, erano stati
organizzati due principali eventi di pulizia (uno a Bologna, di fronte alla
stazione centrale e l'altra a Roma, in Piazza Vittorio Emanuele). Il ministro
dell'Ambiente stesso, Gianluca Galletti, ha preso parte a questi eventi,
insieme con il Sottosegretario per l'Ambiente Barbara Degani. Questo ci ha consentito
di raggiungere una copertura mediatica significativa e di migliorare la
sensibilizzazione dei cittadini di al problema.
I risultati dello scorso anno? 400.000
persone coinvolte in Italia, 800.000
in Europa. 21 tonnellate di rifiuti
raccolti in Italia, 2.600 tonnellate in
Europa.
La campagna Pulisci & Corri
porta il nostro obiettivo a un livello ancor più alto. Non solo coinvolgeremo nuovamente
il Ministero dell'Ambiente e altre portatori di interesse, ma vorremmo anche
coinvolgere più cittadini nell’evento centrale. Il nostro obiettivo è quello
di:
- Raccogliere quanti più rifiuti possibili
nei 400 km di percorso
- Aumentare l'attenzione rivolta dai
media al problema in modo da coinvolgere il maggior numero possibile di
persone nell’ECUD, se non nell’evento centrale, per l'organizzazione di eventi
nel loro territorio.
È per questo che abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto!

<h3>Save the Badgers!</h3>
<h3>This photo shows what happened after habitat was destroyed.</h3>
<h3>For over 12 years, our nonprofit in West Petaluma, CA, dedicated time and energy to save open space habitat for the American Badger.  We finally succeeded in saving the 11.22 Preserve in 2012.  This was after 5 years of opposing development on the land and then an add'l 6 years advocating for public funds from the County Open Space District - derived from a 1/4 cent sales tax we all paid into - to purchase the property and protect it forever for the wildlife and education and appreciation of natural areas.   Visit our <a href=""http://paulalaneactionnetwork.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">web site</a> to learn more about us.  We are an all volunteer grassroots nonprofit.  We helped save a 100-year-old habitat area with year-round Badger activity.</h3>
<p>The same year the open space land was <em>finally</em> acquired, an adjacent 6-acre property (back half shown above - with habitat destruction photo)  with contiguous documented sensitive habitat went into foreclosure and was sold to new owners.  Despite our pleas to stop and calls to the CA Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, the owners intentionally hacked down the entire habitat area, including destroying an area where a female badger had burrowed 2010-2012, raising her young.  After that, illegal grading occurred with roads, further destruction, erection of nonclimb, nonpassable fencing, and installing night lighting - blocking the habitat, the wildlife movement area and destroying a quiet nocturnal area.  Then, horses, dogs and humans entered the area - with destruction complete.  This willful activity has resulted in displacement of all badgers from our area - leaving their 100-year-old habitat.  Badgers are sensitive mammals - they will not remain in an area where there is danger.  The badgers have now also fled from the protected open space land.  We are heartbroken.  And determined to act to protect the easement for conservation that was placed over the open space to protect the very conservation values that are now severely impacted.</p>
<p>The same owners who hacked down the habitat now propose to subdivide that property and add 2 lots after constructing a large multistoried house that dominates the hillside and area.  We want these owners held accountable for the severe destructon they've caused and we are raising funds for legal support to help us oppose the subdivision proposal.  </p>
<p><strong>YOUR DONATION</strong> will help us retain an excellent environmental law firm to help us.  We must do all we can to both protect the open space land for which we worked for so long to save for the badgers and area wildlife and also require accountability for the intense destruction of habitat as well as restoration.  <strong>We seek to raise $2000 for our initial legal support.  All donations will go directly to this effort. (Our initial goal was $7000, but the response has been positive and swift from supporters who understand the gravity of what this destruction has done to the Paula Lane badgers - thank you.)  Help us today reach our new goal of $2000 so our legal fund is sufficient to address the destruction and seek accountability.</strong></p>

<h3> Summary</h3>
<p>Malama Maui Nui - Community Work Day is an organization that was brought into my life a couple of years ago at a large event full of philanthropists, entrepreneurs, and truly Awesome people. A 4-day event of enlightenment, awareness, and passion to be part of the solution instead of continuing to be part of the problem. It was a truly life changing and eye opening weekend on every level for me. </p>
<p>However, the final day of the event there was a moment that left myself and several others bewildered and through this moment, brought a deeper passion and a deeper connection to the work that needs to be done. </p>
<p>After 4 days of 250, like-minded people, talking about being part of the solution and changing the world...there was a choice for everyone to make. They could go learn to surf or they could go and volunteer with the kids at the Ka Hale A Ke Ola homeless center, helping them plant a garden. </p>
<p>As the head of the Community Work Day project, (who is one of the purest and most beautiful souls I have ever had the honor of meeting), stood in the lobby of a fancy Maui hotel.. holding a sign, beaming with excitement knowing how much this would encourage and inspire the kids of the KHAKO Homeless Center...She watched.  </p>
<p>One after the other, speakers, participants, crew members, piled into the buses headed off to the surf lessons, laughing and celebrating being on Maui. Though there is and was absolutely no judgment from anyone on the choice being made, there was a sudden drop in faith.</p>
<p>A lone girl working so hard every day to make a difference in others' lives, was left feeling like the kid that gets picked last for games in school. What would she tell the kids, when she came back alone. How would she stay strong when looking them in the eyes and telling them everyone went surfing instead. Her faith started to shake and her heart thumped harder as more and more people passed her by. </p>
<p>Finally, a familiar face came to greet her, followed by another, and another. It was by no means a comparable amount to the people that chose to surf, but it was something. </p>
<p>The people that chose to trust and go on this journey, were awakened to a world that is indescribable. When all was said and done, they left feeling accomplished, fulfilled and agreed that the moments with the kids and the land, were by far the best of the entire event.  These moments also had a lingering and life changing effect on the kids. The kids that still talk about the visit and would like to have more days like that. </p>
<p>I, myself, was unfortunately too sick to get to be a part of this amazing day and I was so disappointed. However, that Christmas I was given the opportunity to help contribute in a way that again, taught me huge lessens and deepened my passion.</p>
<p>What started out as a push to simply get 8 more gifts donated to KHAKO so that every kid would get a present, quickly and very unexpectedly turned into a snowball of awesome. In 3 days, a small group of us accidentally managed to not only get so many presents donated that each kid got multiple gifts, but we also raised $1000 to be used for something that would have a lasting effect for the kids. </p>
<p>After much debate of how the extra funds should be used, the kids finally spoke up. They asked for a new playground that was more like what other kids got to play on, vs their run down and hazardous jungle gym.</p>
<p>Ask, believe, receive. There was no discussion and the funds were immediately donated to helping build a playground and garden, happily. *Thank you to everyone that donated. </p>
<p>This was just my personal introduction into Malama Maui Nui - Community Work Day. The organization goes so much deeper and is doing so much for Maui, Hawaii and the planet. In my eyes, they are so deserving of so much more recognition and support. </p>
<p>For my first of at least 31 Random Acts of Aloha on my Birthday, I have created this indiegogo account to raise money to support Malama Maui Nui. I will be giving 100% of the donations to the organization and pledging to give at least 31 days of this year to volunteering with their projects, fundraisers, events and anywhere that I can. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking of you, to donate whatever you can, be it money, time or both. </p>
<p>The minimum goal you can start an indiegogo account is $500. If you do not reach your goal, indiegogo takes 9% for fees. However, if you do reach your goal, they put back in 5% so that only 4% comes out of the total.</p>
<p>I have given this campaign 31 days until it expires. I have over 900 facebook friends. That means you don't even have to donate an entire dollar! If every one of my fb friends donated 50 cents! We would reach the min. limit.</p>
<p>However, this is me we are dealing with over here. We can Go Bigger. </p>
<p>31 random acts of Aloha on my 31st birthday, 31 days until this campaign expires...hmm, what's the magic number...That's right. Let's shoot for $3100!</p>
<p>It would also be awesome if 31 of my friends chose to volunteer, even just 1 day, to any of the projects Malama Maui Nui offers.  </p>
<p>Please take the time to read what the organization is doing....</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>Litter Barrels: 307</p>
<p>Trash Pickups from Groups: 72</p>
<p>Hot Spots Cleared: 364</p>

<p>Outreach Events: 31 Community Recycling</p>

<p>Gardens workdays with outdoor education: 114</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is a saying “He va’a he moku, he moku he va’a” It translates literally as, “The canoe is an island, an island a canoe.” Metaphorically, it means that everything you do...or DON’T do- impacts where we are going as an island. There are no forgotten people on the canoe...no one is left behind. We have to remember that we are all in this together. We are all a part of this island...and there can be no forgotten communities.</p>
<p>In 2011, CWD got a grant from the Center for Disease control- which was aimed to reduce health disparities among the communities that were considered “highest risk”. The “Highest risk” communities were all Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander and low income communities. What we also found was that these same communities also had the highest rate of a long list of other things- from suicide rates, to incarcerations, depression to diabetes, school-drop out rates, drug use, teen-pregnancy, domestic abuse and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>What was the commonality that connected all of these communities aside from the socio-economic? What was the thread that connected them all?. All of them lived in areas deemed “food deserts”...cut off from literally the very source of their life, their energy, their nourishment that this land provides. There are no community gardens, no Mana foods, there is literally no access to affordable locally grown food.</p>
<p>And we began to wonder what would happen to all of those statistics, all of those numbers if we fixed just that one piece that we COULD make an impact on? What would happen if we reawakened these roots. What would happen if we gave these communities the same access that other wealthier communities have to healthy organic food, to outdoor education and hands-on-learning, to safe spaces for building community?. What would happen to the childrens attention span in school if they were well nourished when they went to class each day? What would happen to the communities if they were woven together again by the very thread of life itself? “</p>
<p>We decided to find out...</p>
<p>CWD/Malama Maui Nui now has 23 gardens throughout the lowest income parts of the island, from the low-income schools to the homeless shelter. These gardens are growing more than just healthy food, they are growing healthy communities, they are growing healthy families, they are growing healthy keiki.</p>

What we also found was that these same communities also had the highest rate of a long list of other things- from suicide rates, to incarcerations, depression to diabetes, school-drop out rates, drug use, teen-pregnancy, domestic abuse and the list goes on and on.
What was the commonality that connected all of these communities aside from the socio-economic? What was the thread that connected them all?. All of them lived in areas deemed “food deserts”...cut off from literally the very source of their life, their energy, their nourishment that this land provides. There are no community gardens, no Mana foods, there is literally no access to affordable locally grown food.
And we began to wonder what would happen to all of those statistics, all of those numbers if we fixed just that one piece that we COULD make an impact on? What would happen if we reawakened these roots. What would happen if we gave these communities the same access that other wealthier communities have to healthy organic food, to outdoor education and hands-on-learning, to safe spaces for building community?. What would happen to the childrens attention span in school if they were well nourished when they went to class each day? What would happen to the communities if they were woven together again by the very thread of life itself? “
We decided to find out...
CWD/Malama Maui Nui now has 23 gardens throughout the lowest income parts of the island, from the low-income schools to the homeless shelter. These gardens are growing more than just healthy food, they are growing healthy communities, they are growing healthy families, they are growing healthy keiki.
 


Other Ways You Can Help
Giving money to a life changing cause is a great start, but it's just that. A start. We can and need to do more.
I know the people of Malama Maui Nui personally and how much blood, sweat and tears they have put into these projects.  They need your help! If you aren't able to give money, or you gave money and still want to do more.. PLEASE! Contact them and volunteer for at least one of the Community Work Day Projects. 
 


Here's a breakdown of our weekly schedule:

 



<3 Every Tuesday at the Ka hale a Ke ola Homeless resource center from 9-6pm

<3 Wednesdays starting new veggies, herbs, and fruit trees for the school and low income communities (MMN gives away over 1000 plants each month) 3361 omaopio rd in lower kula

<p class=""p1""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">Many young people have no idea that anything they do has any real cause or effect good or bad. ï¿½Things just happen.ï¿½ ï¿½The world just is.ï¿½ We treat our bodies and the planet as if itï¿½s all ï¿½just thereï¿½. And certainly, few damaged young people have any understanding that their own lives could ever make any positive change or difference to the world. When a young person produces a positive ripple effect of health by his or her own hands and mind for the very first time, a whole new world opens<span class=""s1"">.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1""><b>Serious conservation work:</b> Not just involved in ï¿½busy workï¿½ at any location, GPRC participants produce targeted high value ecological benefits helping save and restore some of North Americaï¿½s rarest and most threatened or damaged ecosystems while simultaneously healing their own conflicts, threats and damage.

<p class=""p1""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1""><b>Serious social work:</b> Like twin strands of DNA, social work and ecological recovery and protection are intertwined. Supported by licensed master social workers, counselors, and mentors, youth and young adults who face multiple crises and trauma enter into a 3-tier Ecological Health training program certification process that first helps people stabilize their lives, then develop tools to thrive. See GPRCï¿½s trademarked Life Wheel for a diagram of this process.</p>
<p class=""p1""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">Your support for the<b> Upper Texas Gulf Coastal Prairie</b> will not only help one of the rarest and most endangered places stay alive but provide training, re-entry, and life stabilization for struggling people locally as well as, eventually, nationally once we get the Visiting Service Learning component set up. </p>

<h1>Our Story </h1>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">My big-hearted, rescue German Shepherd, Fassbinder, was unexpectedly diagnosed with cancer this month.  Fassbinder has B-cell lymphoma -- which is not a death sentence.  With 6 months of chemotherapy</span><b style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""> he has a 90% chance of complete remission.</b><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">  </span></p>
</div>
<p>He's been a major part of my life.  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In 2012, I was raped.  When I reported my assault to the police, I started receiving threats.  I rescued a German Shepherd for my own protection.  In the past two years, he's deterred crime twice -- the second time was with a burglar.  With chemotherapy he can enjoy a high standard of living -- I feel a </span>complete sense<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of duty to help save his life. </span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/906272/files/20141005151118-me_and_fass_goofy_smaller.jpg?1412547078"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/><br/></p>
<p>Just today, I drove behind a bumper sticker -- a paw print -- that asked, ""Who adopted who?""  And as cliche as that sounds, it might be an important maxim for assault recovery.<br/></p>
<p>Caring for another life forces you to adopt a routine and function again -- it gives you something to live for, and in my case -- it was the determining factor to end my depression.<br/></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">But Fassbinder also benefitted:  he learned structure and was adopted into a loving home.  Large breeds are often the first to be killed at overcrowded shelters -- and I purposefully chose a dog on death-row, with a high-kill rate.  Fassbinder was given a second chance at life.</span><br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story 
My big-hearted, rescue German Shepherd, Fassbinder, was unexpectedly diagnosed with cancer this month.  Fassbinder has B-cell lymphoma -- which is not a death sentence.  With 6 months of chemotherapy he has a 90% chance of complete remission.  

He's been a major part of my life.  In 2012, I was raped.  When I reported my assault to the police, I started receiving threats.  I rescued a German Shepherd for my own protection.  In the past two years, he's deterred crime twice -- the second time was with a burglar.  With chemotherapy he can enjoy a high standard of living -- I feel a complete sense of duty to help save his life. 

Just today, I drove behind a bumper sticker -- a paw print -- that asked, ""Who adopted who?""  And as cliche as that sounds, it might be an important maxim for assault recovery.
Caring for another life forces you to adopt a routine and function again -- it gives you something to live for, and in my case -- it was the determining factor to end my depression.





But Fassbinder also benefitted:  he learned structure and was adopted into a loving home.  Large breeds are often the first to be killed at overcrowded shelters -- and I purposefully chose a dog on death-row, with a high-kill rate.  Fassbinder was given a second chance at life.


Now he needs another chance. 
       
The Goal is Complete Remission...
All funds from this campaign contribute to helping Fassbinder attain complete remission.  Staying on schedule is essential to reach this goal.  Timing is everything.

Here is a copy of the protocol outlined by his oncologists, Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Turner at Veterinary Cancer Group. (click on Gallery)





  What has been accomplished…
Fassbinder has begun chemotherapy -- he's doing great!

I have contributed $3000 for his treatment from savings, picking up extra shifts at work, busting ass, etc.  $3000, essentially took care of staging (where they assess type of cancer, run tests, ultrasound etc) and the first chemotherapy treatment.  
Any amount given goes immediately to his care.     


   
Most importantly, Fassbinder is feeling great!  
Here he is all-smiles, yesterday, 10 weeks into chemo.  He has such bright spirits and tremendous energy!  I can't thank everyone enough who has helped us get here!  It's heartwarming!  Such a happy dog!!",10.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<br/><h3>We Need To Cover Trial Costs<br/>
</h3>
<p>Expert witnesses and knowledgeable attorneys are invaluable when presenting allegations of water contamination and damages before a court of law. Scott Ely, <a href=""http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/gas-company-whistle-blower-details-spills-errors-1.1234817"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">who has spoken out as a gas industry whistle-blower</a>, his family, and their neighbors, the Huberts, are proceeding with a landmark federal lawsuit over 
drilling-related water contamination in Pennsylvania. In 2014,
 the judge  ruled that the plaintiffs' case can proceed to trial, permitting jury selection.<br/></p>
<p>The lawsuit entitled Norma Fiorentino et al vs Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Corporation and Gas Search Drilling Services Corp. was brought in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (Civil No. 3:09-CV-2284) on November 19, 2009.  The case eventually included 22 families from Dimock and Springville Townships in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, who sought fair compensation for damages to their property and their lives caused by Cabot’s failed natural gas drilling operations.</p>
<p>Beginning in the fall of 2008, Dimock families with children noticed problems with their drinking water, and began to experience rashes, nausea, headaches and dizziness. A trigger point to the litigation was the explosion of an elderly resident’s private water well on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 2008 due to methane gas accumulation in the well head.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/669050/files/20140623092656-Screen_shot_2014-06-23_at_12.30.17_PM.png?1403540816"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<blockquote>Holding
 up a sample of Scott's water, hydrologist Paul Rubin said, ""Here, you can see it as 
it now comes  out  of  the  well – the color of  chocolate  milk, five  
times  the  maximum  allowable PA MCL Safe  Drinking Water standard (75 
 vs.  15  color  units) for  color.    Even  after  weeks,  it still 
does not settle out"" </blockquote>
<p>Following the public announcement by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the summer of 2012 that the water was safe to drink, the vast majority of the families settled their lawsuits against Cabot. Two families, totaling four adults and five children, whose water wells were ordered permanently plugged by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection in connection with Cabot’s drilling operations, did not agree to settle. A third non-settling case is that of the Estate of Kenneth Ely whose claim was dismissed by the Court and is being appealed.<br/></p>
<p>The accuracy of EPA’s statement in 2012 that Dimock’s water was safe to drink was later <a href=""http://www.desmogblog.com/2013/08/05/censored-epa-pennsylvania-fracking-water-contamination-presentation-published-first-time"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">called into question as a result of disclosure of contradictory statements</a> contained in internal EPA documents.<br/></p>
<p>The remaining plaintiffs in the case, which has now been re-captioned as Nolen Scott Ely, et al. v Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Corporation et al., are Nolen Scott Ely and his family and Ray Hubert and his family. Ray Hubert and his family live up the hill from the Elys. The Ely family has lived in Dimock since the 1800’s.<br/><br/>Except for a two year period when Cabot supplied these plaintiffs with water, since 2008, the Elys and Huberts have been living without reliable access to water and under rationing conditions.  To survive day to day, these families haul water at their own expense every week for drinking, bathing and other daily basics. They purchase bottled water for drinking and cooking. The Court has recognized that these plaintiffs have a case against Cabot which they are preparing to present to a jury of their peers. The trial date is expected to be set in April, according to court documents. <br/></p>
<p>In order to effectively try the case, the Elys and Huberts must retain witnesses including a hydrologist, an engineer, and property expert. Our administration fees include our accountant’s time and will be five percent of funds raised. Legal fees for attorneys will be paid with the remainder of funds.<br/></p>
<p>We estimate that costs associated with the trial will be between $50,000 and $100,000. As part of our Energy Jutice Shale Initiative, we are committing to raising a substantial portion of these funds.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Water Contamination in Dimock</h3>
<p>In
 2008, well water in homes along Carter Rd went bad after Cabot Oil 
&amp; Gas developed the first drilling operations in northeast Pennsylvania. 
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection <a href=""http://files.dep.state.pa.us/OilGas/OilGasLandingPageFiles/FinalCO&amp;A121510.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">determined</a>
 that well casing failures in the Baker, Gesford, Ratzel, and Ely wells 
had caused 17 water wells to become contaminated. Subsequently, Cabot entered into several consent orders regarding that contamination.</p>
<p>In 2011, HydroQuest's Paul Rubin, an expert hydrologist, <a href=""http://www.frackthemovie.com/HydroQuest%20-%20Dimock%20Press%20Statement%2012-06-11.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">determined in his initial findings</a>
 that Scott Ely's water contained lead and manganese at 5.8 and 10 times
 State Maximum Contaminate Levels and arsenic at 15 times the State MCL 
level. He found aluminum concentration  of  28  mg/l,  some  140  times 
 the  State  MCL.<br/></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Aluminum  is a  potent  neurotoxin  that
  may  be linked  to dementia,  including Alzheimer’s like health  
symptoms.    Similarly, iron  was  detected  at  34  mg/l,  some  113  
times  the State  MCL Safe  Drinking  Water standard. </p>
<p>At the 
time, Mr. Rubin stated, ""While  all  analyses  have  not  been  
completed,  preliminary findings also indicate the presence of low level
 hexanes, octanes, and decanes.""</p>
<p>He added ""However, the high pH of
 the water indicates the presence of SIGNIFICANT other frack - related 
chemicals that are both unknown  and  untested – chemical  compounds  
that  do  not  have  MCLs – chemicals  that  potentially present 
long-term chronic exposure to toxins and carcinogens.""</p>
<p>Rubin found
 that the pH of the water has repeatedly been found to be around 9.5 – a
 very basic water, some 10 times  the  normal  outer  MCL State  
drinking  water  standard range of  pH  8.5  and,  quite likely,  100  
times that  of a  more  normal Dimock groundwater  pH.    ""This  is  
highly  unusual  and extremely troubling.  Something is VERY wrong with 
this water,"" he wrote in testimony offered at a press conference.</p>

As Other Avenues pays us back over time, we'll be able to use your donations to pay for three more solar projects!While the campaign is over, you can still support the Solar Seed Fund and help us put solar energy in more communities by donating today! We still have some great perks available and all donations will be used for our next solar energy project.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We believe that everyone should have the ability to support clean energy.So we created a new way for people to take action.It's a pretty simple idea actually...We're raising money in this campaign to put solar on Other Avenues, a worker-owned cooperative grocery store.  As they pay us back, we reinvest the money into more solar projects in communities across the country.It's a pay-it-forward model for community solar.We call it the Solar Seed Fund. RE-volv is a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco dedicated to fighting climate change by supporting the growth of solar energy in communities across the United States.By supporting this campaign you are helping Other Avenues 
fulfill its commitment to sustainability, while growing the Solar Seed 
Fund that will finance solar projects around the country.RE-volv has financed two solar projects so far through crowdfunding on Indiegogo (Check out our previous campaigns Plant a Seed for Solar Energy and Revolving Fund for Solar Energy).  The Solar Seed Fund is already revolving, and over $7,000 in lease payments
from our last two projects are helping to fund this one! And with your help, we can make this our biggest project yet! ****Referral Contest****Our hope with this campaign is not just to raise enough money to install solar for Other Avenues. We also want to include as many people as possible in the effort. In other words, we want to build solar through community, and build community through solar!That's where you come in. The 5 individuals who refer the most donors to the campaign will each receive the $1,000 perk!How it works: When you donate, Indiegogo will provide you with a unique URL to share the campaign with your friends.  This keeps track of how many people who you referred to the campaign donated.Remember, your friends have to use your unique URL in order for it to be tracked!About Other AvenuesOther Avenues is a worker-owned cooperative grocery store that's been serving the Outer Sunset community of San Francisco for 40 years.  It serves local, organic, and healthy food and is deeply committed to sustainability and workplace democracy. With your support, Other Avenues can fulfill a long-held dream of
going solar!
Benefits for Other Avenues and the Environment
This campaign will finance a 36 kW solar energy system for the Other Avenues worker-owned cooperative grocery store, saving
them $335,000 over the life of the system, and saving our atmosphere from the emission of 24,000 pounds of
carbon dioxide each year! That's equivalent to planting over 100 acres of trees over the life of the system.
About our model
By donating to the Solar Seed Fund, you’re investing in this solar energy project and future projects for other communities. RE-volv pays for solar energy installations for nonprofits and cooperatives that serve their community. As these community-serving organizations
pay RE-volv back over time, RE-volv reinvests the principal and the interest it earns with each project into additional solar projects. On average, each project ends up funding another
3 solar projects!  Investing in the Solar Seed Fund means every dollar you donate will go further- your donation will multiply over
time, serving more and more communities with solar.*All
donations to this campaign are tax-deductible.***Check with your employer to see if they'll match your donation!**About our PerksAll of our perks were carefully selected by our team to support your 
passion for the environment, solar energy, and healthy food.Of course the biggest perk of all is 
knowing that each dollar invested in solar today will benefit the 
community and the environment for years to come.You'll notice that for each perk level we've figured out how much carbon dioxide will be avoided because of your donation over the 25 year warranty of this solar array.*Exact perk details are subject to availability.*Supporting OrganizationsWe are extremely grateful for our partner organizations that support this campaign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Campaign SponsorsWe owe a huge debt of gratitude to our sponsors who have donated products and contributed financially to this campaign.",19.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Elijah Martineau is a 12-year old from Lansing, Michigan who loves birds.  He has engaged in bird conservation for about 2 years now, with projects put on by bird clubs and by volunteering at a local urban natural area, Fenner Nature Center.  Elijah is also great at designing things.  He decided that he’d like to put these two passions together and redesign the feeder area at the nature center to help migrating birds on their journeys north and south and to help the birds that live here year round. </p>
<p>Elijah will create a design for the feeding area to promote native plants, insects, birds and mammals.  Many of plants in Fenner's bird feeding area are non-native, so insects that need native plants are not found in the area.  That, in turn, affects the diversity of birds that use the feeding area.  Because of this, Elijah will start with the plants.  Then he will add in features that make a great bird feeding station.</p>
<p>Particularly because Fenner is an urban nature center, supporting more diversity in the bird feeding area will give children and adults more opportunities to learn about and observe wildlife they may have never seen before.  He wants to share his experience of learning about and becoming an advocate for birds or other wildlife.  He may even have the chance to teach summer camp kids about conservation and about his project!</p>
<p>Fenner Nature Center is an urban, 134-acre oasis.  The land is owned by the city of Lansing, but managed by the non-profit organization, Fenner Conservancy.  Because Elijah is working with a non-profit organization, he needs to raise funds for this project.</p>
<p><strong>What Elijah Needs &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Elijah has spent the last few weeks researching for and budgeting his project.  He has conducted telephone interviews with various nature centers about their feeding areas.  He has done online research to find great products.  He has asked questions about plants that are native to our area and gotten information on which ones attract birds and insects.</p>
<p>He needs to raise about $1,200 in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy native plants and shrubs from a local nursery.</li>
</ul><p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><em>$290 for wholeshale prices from WildType Nursery</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Build a path through the feeding area, build and paint a blind for people to observe birds, build a trellis for native vines, and build nesting spaces for native bees.</li>
</ul><p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><em>$315 for wood, hardware, paint, edging, and paving stones</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase a new birdbath with a winter heater.</li>
</ul><p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><em>$80 for a birdbath, heater, extension cord, and cord protector</em></p>
<p>       •  Purchase Michigan-made cedar feeders, a roost box, and butterfly house</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><em>$132 for purchases from Stovall feeders, Mr. Stovall has invited Elijah to his workshop!</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase binoculars for viewing the feeders from inside the building<em>.</em>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>RE-volv is a non-profit organization that is growing the movement for community-based solar energy. By crowdfunding, RE-volv will finance community-based solar energy projects using a revolving fund called the Solar Seed Fund. The Solar Seed Fund pays for solar energy installations on local community centers like schools and non-profits.  The community centers pay RE-volv back over time through the savings on their electric bill. RE-volv reinvests the principal and the revenues it earns on each project into additional solar projects, creating a revolving fund in a pay-it-forward model.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>RE-volv needs an additional $10,000 to finance the first community-based solar energy installation to get the revolving fund off the ground.  We've already raised $20,000. With $10,000 more we will be able to afford a $30,000 solar installation for a community-serving organization. This one installation will generate enough revenue to fund an additional three solar energy systems over time!</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign you have a number of amazing perks to choose from including access to events, a certificate or photo of the solar you helped install, and a choice of amazing books about solar energy and the future of environmentalism.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal with this campaign, we will still use all of this money for the first solar energy project and your impact will still have the same multiplier effect.</p>
<p>All donations to this campaign are tax-deductible.</p>
<p><em>Also, let us know if you'd like to make a donation in someone else's name.  This can be a great holiday gift!</em></p>

<p>The<strong> ECO SEX SYMPOSIUM</strong> will be held <strong>June 29 to July 1</strong> in <strong>Portland, OR</strong>, and will include 21 workshops, 3 keynote speakers, live entertainment, and live-raw food, plus vendors, free talks, and an Eco Ball.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKERS:</strong></p>
<p>Our keynote speakers are Bob Czimbal, author, workshop leader, nationally sought after presenter, and Serena Anderilini, Ph.D., professor, author and interntional speaker.<br/><br/><strong>Plus 16 other presenters from near and far on topics ranging from alternative economies, sustainable communities, permaculture, conscious birthing, reproductive choice, and birth control methods that don't harm the ecosystem, live raw food, sex, love, and relationship, activisim, sex, and ecology, and more!</strong></p>
<p><strong>FUNDING:</strong></p>
<p>We need funds to pay speaker fees, rental costs, food costs, and to help fund a “free marketplace” to help encourage the “gift economy” (We plan to trade goods and services for GoddessBucks, so no one is turned away and everyone contributes). We also want to pay our volunteers and key organizers a small stipend.<br/> </p>

What is Eco Sex?

Going Green between the sheets with body/earth safe products,
Green Dating, ecosexuals only date other ecosexuals,
Choosing life and love styles that are sustainable,
Creating a culture that values nature, even our sexual nature
My body, my gender, my orientation: Baby I was Born This Way!
Nature is sexy - Let's make Nature our lover, not our mother.

<p>We are Mourette Valcin and Chris Bashirov Newton, and we have the opportunity of a lifetime.  We will become stewards of an 80 acre property in North Michigan.  The land has been used for agroforestry and permaculture, and is surrounded by land rich in resources, beautiful lakes, and fruit orchards.  We hope to continue the practice of cultivating Pine forest, and using the rich resources on the land that are often overlooked, to further our mission.  The land will become a homestead and institute fostering education as well as self-sufficiency, and we will be documenting our experience in the process.</p>
<p><strong>This includes:</strong></p>
<p>-Planting food forests as perennial poly-culture gardens, allowing production of fruit, vegetables, herbs, and flowers, which will grow into a mature ecosystem.</p>
<p>-Building infrastructure from natural materials on site for educational purposes, and self maintaining dwellings. </p>
<p>-Connecting with local, and global communities to share and engage in research in order to continue the <span>propagation</span> of sustainable practices. </p>
<p>-Continuing research and agroforestry </p>
<p>-Inviting others to learn,  live, and visit onsite, and to practice alongside us</p>
<p>-Creating a legacy for those involved and generations to come<strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Fortunately, the costs for development using Permaculture methods, such as stacking functions, using <span>recycled</span> materials, and an abundance of onsite resources, is <strong>extremely low! </strong>We are asking for $2,500 start-up funds for our sustainable homestead and institute.<strong>   See the Video for more details!</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is permaculture you ask?</strong></p>
</div>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<div>
<p>In my opinion, a fancy word for working with the land and people instead of against land and its people which we have seen happening to this date. Permaculture stemming from permanent agriculture/culture has been growing and will continue to grow especially with the help of community members, those who feel it is something to invest in. Permaculture is a lifestyle. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Agroforestry?</strong></p>
<p>Agroforestry is a term which describes the <span>propagation</span> and cultivation of trees <span>strategically</span>used as a means of preserving/enhancing the productivity of land.  All trees have various uses and benefits, all of which benefit humans and nature, as they provide micro climates for liveable temperatures, as their roots hold the soil from flooding, and their leaves produce oxygen and help the atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>we are:</p>
<p>2 new permaculture designers</p>
<p>2 yoga instructors</p>
<p>2 cooks</p>
<p>1 baker</p>
<p>1 musician,</p>
<p>and most of all 2 students, the universe our classroom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the past year, we both lived in a community setting at Sivananda Yoga Ashram, which led us to take a permaculture design course, and become certified yoga <span>instructors</span>. We were able to gain invaluable skills from teachers Charles and Julia Yelton and are more then ready to get our hands dirty on our future site. </p>

<h2><strong>Our Roots</strong></h2>
<p>The double earthquakes of April/May 2015 spawned our first works, instigated to interrupt the bleak day-to-day outlook that existed in those broken times. After all nothing gets you looking forward like imagining a tree--you planted--growing and fruiting hey? 150 fruit and nut trees were distributed to 30 youths between 10-14 years of age in our village of <i>Gaggle </i>in<i> Bhumi Dhara</i>, <i>Kavre District</i>.</p>
<p>As we believe that empty giving rarely helps, a day long class was hosted with the children and community on how to plant and care for their trees.</p>
<p><i>Trees For Relief</i>  is grown and maintained by a small group of foreigners, who combined have a history of two decades working, planting and growing in Nepal. The project is cared for and hosted by <i>5 Elements Organic Bastion</i>--an organic farm run by some members of <i>Trees For Relief</i>--this way nothing is ever left unattended.</p>
<p>Our works were further boosted after the <i>Nepal Earthbag Project</i> came to Gaggle in November 2015 building an Earthbag Dome to help show locals stronger affordable construction methods for the post earthquake rebuild. This dome was gifted to <i>Trees For Relief</i>  to serve as our future classroom and center.                                                       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471935672/ivqs3ymwpqbqxxevv8fb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In January 2016 <i>Trees For Relief  </i>hosted 3 days of tree-training, where about 20 people learned how to care and expand on the trees that were distributed post earthquake. The workshop was received warmly by all who participated.</p>
<h3><strong>So, what are we looking for?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. Complete Classroom (Dome)--$2500.</strong></p>
<p>This beauty's got to get plastered--preferably using old-style lime plaster, its kitchen room needs completion and a modest solar system installed to keep it ""off-grid"".</p>
<p><strong>2. ""Mother-Tree"" Resource Garden--$500.</strong></p>
<p>Plant 25 well sourced, high value fruit and nut trees, creating an onsite resource for cutting and grafting future tree populations.</p>
<p><strong>3. Greenhouse &amp; Native Nursery System--$2500.</strong></p>
<p>Its great to have cuttings grafted but, they need somewhere to be safe and grow strong before moving to permanent locations. A modest greenhouse for 1000 cuttings annually is in the planning design.</p>
<p>To not loose focus on native plants we have a nursery setup planned for starting native root-stocks for graftings. And importantly, to propagate native hardwood trees from seed and clone for future supplies of quality timber.</p>
<p><strong>4. Purchase The Land--$3000.</strong></p>
<p>Keeping this project safe for future generations is important and nothing does that like land deeds. Purchasing has been negotiated for the 500sq/m area of dome, garden and greenhouse/nursery for the very reasonable price of $2500 plus legal fees, etc $500.</p>
<p><strong>5. Classes, Teachers, Knowledge--$1500</strong></p>
<p>Open classes to all, on the first Saturday of each month, with teachers receiving a fair payment of $50 per class. And lets shake it up, teachers from anywhere who have credible knowledge to share in all aspects of ""Organic"" farming throughout the year, whether its Grafting in winter, or Bee-keeping in spring, Mulching, Composting... you get the idea.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When society wishes a better future, one of the best places to invest is in community building, environmental protection and youth development. Daily, Nepal sees 1500-2000 people leave home and family to toil abroad in countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Malaysia. Few leave for education. Even less return wealthy. Those who do quickly leave village-life as its seen as ""backwards"".</p>
<p>Young people have little or no facilities except school, if they go. Village life has little pastime activities other than festivals or marriages etc. Alcoholism and domestic violence have become real issues in modern society.</p>
<p>Through this project it's hoped to create a small bubble--helping to ""lightly"" address these issues, while also helping answer the larger questions of deforestation, global warming and outward migration.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Us?</h3>
<p>Nepal, ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world has seen its fair share of problems: civil war, political upheavals, national strikes, fuel shortages, border blockades and natural disasters to name but a few. In fact we've probably seen more things go wrong than most.</p>

</div></div>","Our Roots
The double earthquakes of April/May 2015 spawned our first works, instigated to interrupt the bleak day-to-day outlook that existed in those broken times. After all nothing gets you looking forward like imagining a tree--you planted--growing and fruiting hey? 150 fruit and nut trees were distributed to 30 youths between 10-14 years of age in our village of Gaggle in Bhumi Dhara, Kavre District.
As we believe that empty giving rarely helps, a day long class was hosted with the children and community on how to plant and care for their trees.
Trees For Relief  is grown and maintained by a small group of foreigners, who combined have a history of two decades working, planting and growing in Nepal. The project is cared for and hosted by 5 Elements Organic Bastion--an organic farm run by some members of Trees For Relief--this way nothing is ever left unattended.
Our works were further boosted after the Nepal Earthbag Project came to Gaggle in November 2015 building an Earthbag Dome to help show locals stronger affordable construction methods for the post earthquake rebuild. This dome was gifted to Trees For Relief  to serve as our future classroom and center.                                                       
In January 2016 Trees For Relief  hosted 3 days of tree-training, where about 20 people learned how to care and expand on the trees that were distributed post earthquake. The workshop was received warmly by all who participated.
So, what are we looking for?
1. Complete Classroom (Dome)--$2500.
This beauty's got to get plastered--preferably using old-style lime plaster, its kitchen room needs completion and a modest solar system installed to keep it ""off-grid"".
2. ""Mother-Tree"" Resource Garden--$500.
Plant 25 well sourced, high value fruit and nut trees, creating an onsite resource for cutting and grafting future tree populations.
3. Greenhouse & Native Nursery System--$2500.
Its great to have cuttings grafted but, they need somewhere to be safe and grow strong before moving to permanent locations. A modest greenhouse for 1000 cuttings annually is in the planning design.
To not loose focus on native plants we have a nursery setup planned for starting native root-stocks for graftings. And importantly, to propagate native hardwood trees from seed and clone for future supplies of quality timber.
4. Purchase The Land--$3000.
Keeping this project safe for future generations is important and nothing does that like land deeds. Purchasing has been negotiated for the 500sq/m area of dome, garden and greenhouse/nursery for the very reasonable price of $2500 plus legal fees, etc $500.
5. Classes, Teachers, Knowledge--$1500
Open classes to all, on the first Saturday of each month, with teachers receiving a fair payment of $50 per class. And lets shake it up, teachers from anywhere who have credible knowledge to share in all aspects of ""Organic"" farming throughout the year, whether its Grafting in winter, or Bee-keeping in spring, Mulching, Composting... you get the idea.

The Impact
When society wishes a better future, one of the best places to invest is in community building, environmental protection and youth development. Daily, Nepal sees 1500-2000 people leave home and family to toil abroad in countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Malaysia. Few leave for education. Even less return wealthy. Those who do quickly leave village-life as its seen as ""backwards"".
Young people have little or no facilities except school, if they go. Village life has little pastime activities other than festivals or marriages etc. Alcoholism and domestic violence have become real issues in modern society.
Through this project it's hoped to create a small bubble--helping to ""lightly"" address these issues, while also helping answer the larger questions of deforestation, global warming and outward migration.

Why Us?
Nepal, ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world has seen its fair share of problems: civil war, political upheavals, national strikes, fuel shortages, border blockades and natural disasters to name but a few. In fact we've probably seen more things go wrong than most.
So what qualifies us? Well that's just it, we've been through it all and still standing, still growing. We are surrounded by a small group of dedicated people not easily shocked or prone to leaving. Despite all the daily struggles and hurdles we are still here. Our community has seen that too, earning a respect for hard work, steadfastness and sharing.
We can't promise much, other than we are here working, doing and will continue to do so.

</div></div>","Each purchase of an Ocean Bottle funds the collection of 1000 ocean-bound plastic bottles. And, the Ocean Bottle combines the best features of reusable bottles in one: OUR INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN HAS NOW CLOSED. YOU CAN STILL BE THE OWER OF A FIRST BATCH BOTTLE BY VISITING OUR SITE HERE.                     The average rate of plastic currently flowing into our oceans is 22 million kgs per day, essentially the volume of a truck each minute.  Plastic pollution is a symptom of the real issue: a lack of infrastructure and incentives to recycle where it is needed most. We’ve teamed up with The Plastic Bank to pay above market rates to plastic collectors and set up recycling infrastructure so that plastic can be sold and created into new products. Together, we’re enabling people living in poverty all over the world to make a fair living from collecting plastic, and creating an economy where plastic has a value.  11.368kgs of plastic? More bottles than you might use in 6 years? Enough to fill a small car?1000 plastic bottles can be hard to imagine. So we collected 1000 bottles from the favelas of Brazil to demonstrate the impact of one Ocean Bottle. It's more than you'd think and bear in mind we don't just collect bottles, we actually collect all types of plastic which can be even more: The Ocean Bottle is designed to be the last reusable bottle you’ll ever need to buy. We partnered with the award-winning Norwegian design agency K8 to create a 500ml bottle that combines the best features that exist with a series of new innovative functions.Featured in...The final bottle will mirror the renders above. The Ocean Bottle is vacuum insulated, so it keeps hot drinks piping hotand cool drinks ice cold.  Our cap contains anti-leak technology which means it's safe in your bag,while the easy carry loop makes it a breeze to take on the go.There are two openings; a small one for easy drinking and a big one for easy filling.The base made of up-cycled ocean plastic lands softly on your table.It designed for everyday use and wherever else your life takes you.And when you go to clean your bottle at the end of the day, you're in luck.The Ocean Bottle is the one of the only dishwasher safe vacuum insulated bottles. Our colours represent the ocean and its surrounding environment. Each bottle is activated with an NFC smart chip, so in future we plan for individuals and organisations to be able to contribute more to plastic collection each time an Ocean Bottle is filled up in participating retail and business locations.Our next phase of the Ocean Bottle project is to forge partnerships with lunch chains, juice bars, coffee chains, water fountain companies, subscription systems, and loyalty programmes to provide for continuous ocean impact.Interested in joining as a partner? email partnerships@oceanbottle.co

 

 
Our challenge was to design a bottle that is both beautiful and functional. To anticipate the users every need, without compromising on sustainability. 

 

 
We examined over 60 bottles, scoured product reviews and conducted countless user interviews to understand the users journey and to develop the ultimate reusable bottle.
 

 
We also chose a selection of sustainable materials to help us deliver the functions while setting a new benchmark for environmental products.
 

 

 
Our co-founder Will was working as a deckhand in the Indian Ocean when he saw the effect of plastic pollution firsthand. It was then he decided to focus on finding a solution. During his masters, Will met 3 individuals who were also determined to make an impact on the ocean plastic crisis. Together, they had just one requirement for a potential solution: develop a system that addresses the root of the problem, rather than a one time fix. After many brainstorming sessions, the Ocean Bottle was born. 
 

 
The root of the idea is in people: The Ocean Bottle funds an ecosystem of plastic collectors, paying them 3x the rate they could previously earn for collected plastic through an IBM Blockchain backed system. The impact is threefold: less plastic entering the ocean from top sources, a reduction in poverty, and the creation of a circular economy around collected plastic reducing the need for new plastic.
 

 

By 2025 we plan to be stopping the equivalent of 3 billion plastic bottles from entering our oceans each year and expanding recycling infrastructure, taking on new plastic projects, and supporting plastic collectors worldwide. But we can't do this without you. We need your help to grow the team of plastic collectors. 

 
This is our mantra, our company culture, and our mission. 
 
Many companies tack on corporate responsibility as an added layer to their business, or donate a vague “percentage of profits” to various causes. Don't get us wrong, that impact is helpful. But this company is focused on sustainability to the core. That's why we've engineered a defined impact per product which is non-negotiable. We're committed to transparency around our impact and empowerment to the consumer. Being a revenue and profit sharing social enterprise also enables us to do even more, beyond our minimum pledge. On that note, let's start with some transparency around where your money is going:

As
I grew older and became more comfortable in the water, I tagged along with my

were in trouble from our actions and I felt like I should do something about
it. 
Koh Tao receives more

many and they are right.  There are too many people coming to this small
21km2 island that the coral reefs are getting overrun. Koh Tao seems like a microcosm of the world and the issues faced there are reflective of what is happening on a global scale.
Inspired to find solutions to these problems facing the coral reefs globally, I worked with local conservation teams Eco Koh Tao & Save Koh Tao. Together we have been working for years now on a
lot of projects to try and help the coral reefs around Koh Tao. Our work has included:·

The aim is to complete
my research and present my findings on the world stage at the 13th International
Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS) in Hawaii in 2016. 
Why is this research important?
Coral reefs exist
throughout the tropics and it’s not just Koh Tao that is affected. Many reefs
around the world are being pressured by human activity. But it is reparable;
you just need the right knowledge and a little will power.  By presenting
this research, I hope to show the world that we can save the coral reefs, it’s
not too late. Furthermore this research will provide building blocks to make it
happen on a more widespread basis.
Where Does this Money go? 
The money raised will go to funding the following…
Risks
& Challenges
There
is a risk that funding is incomplete however we believe that our campaign will
be successful to support the goals I hold so dear to my heart.

Torrent2013: [un]natural interruption

We have pooled our creative energy and come up with a name and concept for this year’s event. Torrent2013: [un]natural interruption reflects our vision for what environmental visual communication can and needs to be.
Effective communication is like magic, and storytelling is at the centre of winning hearts and minds. After decades of environmental decline, it is clear that we need better storytellers. We are here to change the current conversation and spark accelerated action.
How can we accomplish this?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>     </strong>James and Duane Sanders are brothers. James is a U.S Disabled Veteran and Duane is a Retirement Investment Advisor.  James and Duane have always had innovative minds and have the ability to make their ideas materialize.  A perfect example of that is the SRT Sprinkler Removal Tool that comes in two sizes, <em>(the </em><strong><em>SRT 1000</em></strong><em> for sprinklers with tops 1 3/4"" to 2 1/4"" in diameter and the </em><strong><em>SRT 2000</em></strong><em> for sprinklers with tops 2 1/2"" to 2 3/4"" in diameter</em>) that they have a Utility Patent pending on and currently have local retailers including a number of nationally known ACE Hardware Stores. </p>
<p>     This direct sales campaign is two fold: one, to inform Sprinkler System owners across the nation that this tremendous lawn tool exists and two, to raise the funding required for equipment that will allow mass production of the SRT. The SRT allows one to quickly remove and replace pop-up lawn sprinklers versus having to use a shovel to dig the broken sprinkler up which leaves a circle of dead grass and disturbed soil in your lawn.  The SRT grips the top of the sprinkler and enables one to unscrew it from the riser below the surface and twist it right out of the ground leaving a perfectly formed hole for the installation of a new sprinkler.</p>
<p>     The intent of this campaign is to inform individuals who work on sprinkler systems and sprinkler system owners across the nation that this Brand New Lawn Tool exists and is available to them immediately through this campaign.  The SRT literally allows one to ""Leave the shovel in the tool shed and use the SRT instead"" when repairing broken sprinkler heads.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>     Through this campaign, we need to raise $22,500.00. The funds will be used for the needed equipment to facilitate the mass production of the SRT.  This equipment will help in creating much needed jobs right here at home as well as help meet the demand for the SRT Sprinkler Removal Tool in making it available to folks all across this great nation.</p>
<p>     There are several options when purchasing the SRT:  The <strong>“Do it Yourselfer”</strong> is the purchase of one SRT (either model, the SRT 1000 or the SRT 2000), this option is for the person that likes to do things for themselves;  The <strong>“Gang Buster”</strong> is the purchase of six SRTs (3 SRT 1000 and 3 SRT 2000), this option is for the sprinkler repair guy that wants to make his job more efficient – saving time, making more money and wanting to better satisfy their customers by not leaving circles of dead grass and destabilized soil behind; The <strong>“Go Getter” </strong>is the purchase of a display of 12 SRTs (8 model 1000 and 4 model 2000) this option comes with a display suitable for point of purchase sales, this is for the one who wants to be one of the first Retailers in the United States to introduce this<strong> Brand New, One of a Kind Lawn Tool</strong> to the market; and fourth, the <strong>“Entrepreneur”</strong> is the purchase of twenty four (24) SRTs (or more), this is for the student or the person who wants to sell directly and perform live demonstrations and show folks just how incredible this lawn tool is. The entrepreneurs determine their own sales price. Any option that you choose -<strong><em> You won’t go wrong</em></strong>. People get excited about the SRT Sprinkler Removal Tool when it is demonstrated.  With over 1000 sold, not a single one has been returned.  The SRT is made from U.S. steel and is manufactured to last a lifetime.</p>
<p>     If this campaign falls short of its funding goal, the funds received will be put aside until the additional funds are acquired for the funding of the special equipment needed.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>     If you have ever had to replace a broken sprinkler, you know what a chore it can be and the mess it leaves when having to dig a broken sprinkler up with a shovel.  The SRT Sprinkler Removal Tool makes the job Quick, Easy and Clean. When the SRT is used to remove and replace a lawn sprinkler it leaves a perfectly trimmed installed sprinkler head behind. NO MESS and NO Disturbed soil around the replaced sprinkler. The SRT usually takes less than a couple of minutes to use and will save you more money the first time you use it than what it costs to purchase it.</p>
<p>     The most common comment we get from people who have purchased the SRT Sprinkler Removal Tool is:</p>
<h2 align=""center""><em><strong>“It worked exactly the way you told me it would!”</strong></em></h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>     You may not have a need for a SRT Sprinkler Removal Tool at present – that’s ok,<em> we still need your help</em>. Kindly hit the share button and forward this campaign to your FaceBook friends and the folks on your email list. Tell your Family, Friends and Neighbors about this tremendous lawn tool. By doing this, one day when you do need to replace a broken lawn sprinkler, you will be able to go to your Local Hardware Store or come back to our website  <strong><a href=""http://www.pciAbility.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.pciAbility.com</a></strong> and purchase the ""One and only SRT Sprinkler Removal Tool.""</p>

     There are several options when purchasing the SRT:  The “Do it Yourselfer” is the purchase of one SRT (either model, the SRT 1000 or the SRT 2000), this option is for the person that likes to do things for themselves;  The “Gang Buster” is the purchase of six SRTs (3 SRT 1000 and 3 SRT 2000), this option is for the sprinkler repair guy that wants to make his job more efficient – saving time, making more money and wanting to better satisfy their customers by not leaving circles of dead grass and destabilized soil behind; The “Go Getter” is the purchase of a display of 12 SRTs (8 model 1000 and 4 model 2000) this option comes with a display suitable for point of purchase sales, this is for the one who wants to be one of the first Retailers in the United States to introduce this Brand New, One of a Kind Lawn Tool to the market; and fourth, the “Entrepreneur” is the purchase of twenty four (24) SRTs (or more), this is for the student or the person who wants to sell directly and perform live demonstrations and show folks just how incredible this lawn tool is. The entrepreneurs determine their own sales price. Any option that you choose - You won’t go wrong. People get excited about the SRT Sprinkler Removal Tool when it is demonstrated.  With over 1000 sold, not a single one has been returned.  The SRT is made from U.S. steel and is manufactured to last a lifetime.
     If this campaign falls short of its funding goal, the funds received will be put aside until the additional funds are acquired for the funding of the special equipment needed.
The Impact
     If you have ever had to replace a broken sprinkler, you know what a chore it can be and the mess it leaves when having to dig a broken sprinkler up with a shovel.  The SRT Sprinkler Removal Tool makes the job Quick, Easy and Clean. When the SRT is used to remove and replace a lawn sprinkler it leaves a perfectly trimmed installed sprinkler head behind. NO MESS and NO Disturbed soil around the replaced sprinkler. The SRT usually takes less than a couple of minutes to use and will save you more money the first time you use it than what it costs to purchase it.
     The most common comment we get from people who have purchased the SRT Sprinkler Removal Tool is:
“It worked exactly the way you told me it would!”
 
Other Ways You Can Help
     You may not have a need for a SRT Sprinkler Removal Tool at present – that’s ok, we still need your help. Kindly hit the share button and forward this campaign to your FaceBook friends and the folks on your email list. Tell your Family, Friends and Neighbors about this tremendous lawn tool. By doing this, one day when you do need to replace a broken lawn sprinkler, you will be able to go to your Local Hardware Store or come back to our website  www.pciAbility.com and purchase the ""One and only SRT Sprinkler Removal Tool.""

<p>I’m Mason, a recent college graduate from Florida who has fallen in love with adventure.  Throughout college I would forgo internship and job opportunities to ride my bicycle across the country, always raising money for a great cause.  Now that I’m graduated, I want to continue this journey! </p>
<p>This summer/fall, I will be competing in the annual 2,750 mile Great Divide Bicycle Race from Banff, Canada to Antelope Wells, New Mexico.  The trip is almost entirely off-road, completely self-supported, and awesome as heck!</p>

This November we will be traveling for two weeks from Baton Rouge to the “Golden Triangle” Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur India to get a true idea of what daily life in India is really like. What started out as a vacation among friends to an exotic location has turned in to so much more!

Our goal is to live true to that statement. We are Brad Ryland, Trevor Aucoin, and Caroline Rossi, three average but incredibly passionate and adventurous twenty-somethings from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. This November we will be traveling for two weeks from Baton Rouge to the “Golden Triangle” Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur India to get a true idea of what daily life in India is really like. What started out as a vacation among friends to an exotic location has turned in to so much more! The realization is that poverty and the lack of access to clean water in India is a huge issue, but a solvable one. We are setting out on this incredible journey to create a documentary depicting daily life in India and bring global awareness to the issues that over 29 percent of the population face living below the poverty line. What We Need & What You GetWe need your contributions to fund the making of our documentary and aid us to bring global awareness to a worthy  cause.

That’s how Naco introduces himself and when he takes a break from persuading world leaders to live in peace, he follows his passion of sculpting.
The fortune hasn’t always been on Naco’s side. After losing his three bars and a mule-powered transportation company in Sao Paulo he turned to alcohol, which caused him to lose the love of his friends and family and eventually he had to leave the city in search of a new place.
Recently he found a modest shelter within the property of a eco-jungle resort just out of Itacare, Bahia, Brazil. His little shack is divided between an art workshop and simple sleeping space. It’s very small and with the humidity of the Brazilian jungle also very mouldy. His living conditions are very harsh but he continues to create hundreds of pieces of art, working hard every day.
Naco probably never dreamed of what was coming for him - or perhaps he knew it all along?
About 5 years ago a Swiss guy kicked a garbage bin, which - as it happens - was filled with concrete, so he broke his foot on the spot.
This little incident led to an unpredictable chain-reaction which would eventually lead 12 optimists into the jungle of Itacare, Brazil in order to build a house.

And there we were! In the back of Naco’s little shack bringing the news that we’re going to build a new home for him.
Over the past five months we designed, financed and built it all by ourselves. Seeing the old man shine with thankfulness has given us motivation and energy to find ourselves in this foreign culture, to source natural materials and keep building the house day after day - with the unconventional but very cheap technique of compressed clay.Now the foundations are up and we’ve almost finished all the walls. It’s time to cover the house with a roof and work on the interiors. We’re really close to giving Naco a really special place to live and finishing the process of turning his luck around!
We’ll use the funds to buy remaining materials, windows, furniture, kitchen equipment for Naco and some food for the team. The most important thing is the roof - it really rains a lot here!

An exclusive selection of good vibe from Naco. See on the side!
Risks & Challenges
One real problem we may face is that it doesn’t stop raining in the jungle for the next two months. We’ve already had some delays due to the weather, but we’ve also learned how to deal with this and once the roof is complete we’ll be quite weather independent.",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

In a world in search of green solutions and sustainability, our friends the Earthworms are Nature’s Little Recyclers. They can take organic wastes of all kinds and convert them into rich organic compost, nutrient rich organic fertilizers, and they can even provide food for fish and poultry. With a little care and attention, Earthworms can recycle trash from restaurants, homes, farms, and even municipal operations in cities like Chicago and New Orleans.  Nature’s Little Recyclers Earthworm Nursery seeks to provide great resources for our growing green society.<br/><br/><br/> Paganics is a start-up company that is seeking to bring Nature and High Tech together, to answer the needs for a sustainable future, creating quality products and services, and developing long-term jobs for as many people as possible.  We have rented space in <a href=""http://www.theplant.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Plant</a>, one of the leading Urban Vertical Farming Projects located in Chicago, IL.  With this space, we have the ability to reach thousands of people to help them understand the power of Nature’s Little Recyclers to serve us in improving the quality of life. <br/><br/> With your help, we can begin this project.  We are seeking funds to use the 600 square feet of space to establish 60 – thirty gallon bins on a 3 tiered shelving system.  We also want to incorporate harvesters, worm tea brewers, and two tables of testing equipment. This will allow us to breed our first line of earthworms, and will also produce the needed worms for our test bins in other parts of the country. Further, we will be able to offer educational materials to schools, community centers, and ecology programs in Chicago and in other cities. We will provide students with ecological training, as well as green jobs. This is one of the many advantages of being part of a great start-up like The Plant. <br/><br/> Your contribution will help us to develop our earthworm breeding bins and associated equipment, and agricultural and public educational services.  This will help us to produce new green jobs as we scale up operations. <br/><strong><br/> How we are different from other Earthworm Breeders.<br/><br/> Our Unique Position:</strong> In the world of Vermiculturists and Vermicomposters, little is being done to follow and accurately record breeding lines of various earthworm species,  including information on how well they breed or their rate of consumption. At this time, red worms are basically generic.  In addition, many vermicomposters who sell castings and worm tea often do not have accurate information on what their product is comprised of in terms of microbes, nutrients or minerals.  This can result in poor growth and lower yields, which will undermine consumer confidence in green products and solutions.</p>
<p> Paganics plans to acquire and use informational technology to follow lines of red worms (and later other species) from cocoon to death. We will be using QR codes, tracking systems, and Adaptive Database technology, so that our worms can be tracked and measured.  With these tools, various events such as heat or cold die-offs, drought conditions, diseases, etc. and the effects of such on the bins/runs/windrows involved can be recorded.  Over time this will lead to a deeper understanding about earthworms and their growing conditions. This will allow the field to expand its information base and provide advanced breeding and cultivation techniques.</p>
<p>By testing the various composts, castings and teas, Paganics can also show which foods will result in the best fertilizer, and allow us to create a line of 100% organic products that will adapt to different agricultural purposes. Measuring every aspect and recording them in a searchable database will allow a useful knowledge base to improve the overall ability for vermiculturalists and vermicomposters to create a quality product. <br/><br/> Your contributions will help to create a space that is accessible and can be managed effectively to provide worm breeding, primarily red worms (Eisenia fetida) and measure their various outputs in form of cocoons and castings.  We will be able to test various types of foods and organic materials to gain accurate measurements of the rate of consumption.  We will also be able to provide reliable lab testing of worm castings and worm teas composition, in order to provide focused information of our products for the end consumer. This lab would test not just the bins on site but also receive samples from other bins around the country. <br/><br/><strong>Sharing the Data using the Internet<br/><br/></strong>As we develop our Nature’s Little Recyclers Earthworm Nursery, we will create a website that will allow all of our customers to acquire more information directly, including unique identifiers for the earthworms they receive from us.

Fear, paranoia, skepticism, doubt and delay are the result. For trust in climate science to return, new and unique communications strategies are needed. Our polar bears and messages, our prose and our images, and especially our music--good old rock, blues, jazz and folk--all embody this new psychology. </p><h3>Our Background</h3><p>The <a href=""https://www.climatediscovery.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Climate Change Now Initiative</a> is the oldest independent climate science education organization in the world. Founded in 2005, We specialize in reporting the latest climate science discoveries directly from academia, field investigation of climate impacts happening now, and global warming psychology. Bruce Melton, our principle resource, is a professional engineer, environmental researcher, and climate science outreach specialist with over 30 years of experience in critical environmental issues.

The Gulf Stream is shutting down. The Amazon has flipped from a carbon sink to a carbon source. (4, 5, 6)  These are not distant future climate change horrors stories. Thirty years of delay has taken its toll. These abrupt changes (and more) are all happening now and the science has been masked by this extraordinary debate caused by the CCCM.

But climate scientists have basically had 30 years to research the solutions. We now have proven, cheap and unambiguous technologies to take excess carbon dioxide pollution directly out of our sky and make up for the difference that emissions reductions strategies, decarbonization, agricultural techniques, bio energy carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS), and all of the other strategies combined together cannot accomplish. (7) The 2013 IPCC even thought these technologies were important enough to include in their <i>Summary for Policy Makers:</i> ""climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial time scale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period.""</p><p>In other words, we have to remove ""largely"" more than we emit every year. ""Paris"" is only reductions in emissions. We must remove more CO2 from the sky than we emit every year--largely more, regardless of costs. Fortunately, the costs are as manageable as many, many different things we do in our society every year.<a href=""https://www.climatediscovery.org/Global%20Thermostat.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496789073/nrarepvqhp4wyrmgidhi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p style=""font-size: 75%;line-height: 150%;color: #666666;""><i>Carbon Engineering, Squamish, British Columbia: This first of its kind industrial scale facility uses WW II technology that kept our sailors alive in submarines by cleaning carbon dioxide from the air with lye.</i></p><p>But the Climate Change Counter Movement has brought action to a standstill. We have the engineers to do the job, we have the emission reductions strategies to decarbonize our economy, but we cannot muster the will. If we can take action--almost immediately--and remove enough of the excess CO2 from our sky, abrupt changes that are initiating now will reverse. Failure to act however, as per NOAA in 2016, will result in ten feet of sea level rise in just the next 35 to 45 years. (8)  To break the stranglehold we need global warming psychology. If we can overcome this astonishingly ironic deadlock, we can fix the problem for as little money as we spend on advertising across the planet every year.

This is why our work is so important.</p><p>To finally create action, the psychology says: Simplify communications. Minimize ambiguity. Instill trust in our scientists. Don't create fear. Create learning through innovation. Tell a story. Relate, don't dictate. Reveal the innocence of reality and magnitude of risk. Invite participation. And fundamentally, combine science with entertainment: If they aren't in their seats, they aren't listening.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://climatediscoveryy.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498014137/etwvtzumtrjmwzxigizb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p>The most important part of our platform is our <a href=""https://climatediscovery.org/#knowledgebase"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Knowledge Base</a> and over 400 interpretations of academic literature almost completely unknown outside academia.  It's this knowledge base that our films and music are based upon.

<strong>Climate Change Counter Movement…</strong> From 2003 to 2010, $7 billion in climate change counter-movement funding has been identified from revenues reported in IRS tax returns for 91 of 118 organizations and institutions identified in the academic literature as being involved. The research from Drexel and Stanford concludes: “With delay and obfuscation as their goals, the U.S. CCCM has been quite successful in recent decades. However, the key actors in this cultural and political conflict are not just the “experts” who appear in the media spotlight. The roots of climate-change denial go deeper, because individuals’ efforts have been bankrolled and directed by organizations that receive sustained support from foundations and funders known for their overall commitments to conservative causes. Thus to fully understand the opposition to climate change legislation, we need to focus on the institutionalized efforts that have built and maintain this organized campaign. Just as in a theatrical show, there are stars in the spotlight. In the drama of climate change, these are often prominent contrarian scientists or conservative politicians, such as Senator James Inhofe. However, they are only the most visible and transparent parts of a larger production. Supporting this effort are directors, script writers, and, most importantly, a series of producers, in the form of conservative foundations. Clarifying the institutional dynamics of the CCCM can aid our understanding of how anthropogenic climate change has been turned into a controversy rather than a scientific fact in the U.S.” A criticism of this theory is that the conservative political platform funded also supports other issues such as right to life, reduced government and regulations, illegal immigration, lower taxes and etc. Fundamentally however, because the platform supported by this funding is all encompassing, the entire funding supports climate change denial equally to the other parts of the platform.<br/><a href=""https://drexel.edu/~/media/Files/now/pdfs/Institutionalizing%20Delay%20-%20Climatic%20Change.ashx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Brulle 2013, Drexel and Stanford</a> -- Institutionalizing delay: foundation funding and the creation of U.S. climate change counter-movement organizations,"" December 21, 2013.<br/><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Melton, Climate Discovery.org</a> -- The Climate Change Counter-Movement: $7 Billion Umbrella, February 17, 2014.<br/><a href=""http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/40632-the-momentum-of-denial-and-disinformation-trumps-climate-change"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Melton, Truthout.org</a> -- Buoyed by Trump, the Climate Change Counter-Movement Gains Momentum, May 19, 2017.<br/><strong>Media Bias and the Conservative Media…</strong> Work from McGill, Drexel and Bucknell Universities expands on previous work on the causes of the partisan divide among climate science believers.

It's has been subsequently labelled the ""Fairness Bias"" and the way it works is this: in journalists' quest to be fair and present both sides of the story, they feel compelled by their journalistic ethics to report both sides of the story equally and let the consumer determine their own answer. This generally works well with issue based discussions where only morals and ethics are involved. But when facts are involved, and ""alternative"" facts exist that are supported by only three percent of the climate science community or less, and those facts are presented by the media equally to the 97 percent of climate scientists facts that have been proven true, a conflict results where the consumer bases his or her interpretation on the quantity of information presented. To them, it seems like the science remains unsettled, when the reality is just the opposite.<br/>Boykkoff and Boykkoff Balance as bias global warming and the US prestige press Global Environmental Change volume 14 2004.<br/><a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248556678_Balance_as_Bias_Global_Warming_and_the_US_Prestige_Press"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248556...</a> <br/>2)    <strong>Current Policy doubles to triples warming we have already endured…</strong>  The IPCC’s new Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario of RCP2.6, is basically the same thing as 80 percent emissions reductions by 2050 and is described by the IPCC as a “strong mitigation scenario.” RCP2.6 has CO2 peaking at about 440 ppm between 2050 and 2060 and temperature at 1.5 degree C 30 to 40 years later. The increase of 1.6 degrees C is double the current warming since the 1700s. This increase however is the average increase. The worst-case RCP2.6 warming is 2.7 degrees C or more than triple current warming. Considering the understating nature of the IPCC consensus (See Reference 7), the upper limits should be strongly considered as a distinctly plausible. Under the average RCP2.6 modeling and 1.6 degrees of warming with aggressive emissions reductions, the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere does not fall below today’s level until after 2150, and does not return to preindustrial era temperature until long after the year 3000. Under the most extreme RCP2.6 limits with 2.7 degrees of warming above preindustrial times, Earth’s temperature does not fall below our current temperature for well over a 1,000 years.<br/>Meinshausen et al., The RCP greenhouse gas concentrations and their extensions from 1765 to 2300, Climatic Change, November 2011, figure 6. <br/><a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-011-0156-z"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs105...</a><br/><strong>MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change – Results of Paris…</strong> With the Paris Agreement fully implemented on schedule, we can expect 3.5 C of warming by 2100 and with additional negative emissions technologies studied of BECSS (bio-energy with carbon capture and storage--not direct air capture) the increase in warming is held back to 2.4 to 2.7 C by 2100.

Abrupt change up to 100 years ahead of schedule and 100 times more extreme than the IPCC projected…</strong> It is difficult to quantify how much more extreme abrupt change is than the slow changes projected by the IPCC because of many different things: we have never experienced these types of impacts before (sea level jumps, shut down of the Gulf Stream, Amazon flip from sink to source, dynamic collapse of ice sheets. Their unrecoverable nature lends itself poorly to comparisons with a stable and advanced society. Two illustrations are offered: <strong>(A)</strong> <strong>Antarctic ice loss has begun 100 years ahead of schedule…</strong> Antarctic ice loss (surface mass balance, SMB) in the 2007 IPCC Report was supposed to increase, not decrease, for all scenarios, through 2100. This means that snow accumulation was supposed to be more than melt, evaporation and iceberg discharge combined. The 213 IPCC report however, tells us that Antarctic ice loss has already begun,  is substantially large, and approaching the volume of discharge in Greenland.   <strong>(B)</strong> <strong>100 times more extreme…</strong> Abrupt temperature change has occurred 23 times in the last 100,000 years of 9 to 14 degrees F globally and 25 to 35 F in Greenland. The changes generally took decades, but the most extreme occurred in just two to three years. When compared to a world that limits warming to a middle of the road scenario of 3 degrees C (5.4 F) by 2100, 14 F in 2 years is 107 times more extreme.(A) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Fourth Assessment Report, Climate Change 2007: Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis, 10.6.5, Projections of Global Average Sea Level Change for the 21st Century, Table 10.7.<a href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10s10-6-5.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10s10-6-5.html</a> <br/>The 2013 IPCC report tells us that Antarctic ice loss has almost caught up with Greenland… Summary for Policy Makers, B.3 Cryosphere, page 9, second and third bullets. <a href=""http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf</a><br/>(B) Alley, Wally Was Right - Predictive ability of the North Atlantic Conveyor Belt Hypothesis for Abrupt Climate Change, Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Science, February 2007, Figure 1 shows the 23 abrupt climate changes.<a href=""http://shadow.eas.gatech.edu/~kcobb/abrupt/alley07.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://shadow.eas.gatech.edu/~kcobb/abrupt/alley07.pdf</a> <br/><strong>Two to three years</strong>…  -- see also:<br/>Steffensen et al., High-Resolution Greenland Ice Core Data Show Abrupt Climate Change Happens in Few Years, <i>Science Express</i>, June 12 2008, page three, final paragraph.<br/><a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/321/5889/680.abstract"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/321/5889/680.abstract</a><br/><strong>4.

While the mechanisms for ocean melt were present in publication from the early 1990s, it was not until the early 2000s that work first showed definitive evidence of thinning, grounding line retreat, and ice stream acceleration in one of the most sensitive area of West Antarctica, the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Vaughan concludes that if these symptoms are indeed precursors to collapse, then collapse has begun. From what we know today, he was absolutely correct. Vaughan, West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse – the fall and rise of a paradigm, Climatic Change, 2008, see the abstract.<br/><a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/publication/225166993_West_Antarctic_Ice_Sheet_collapse__the_fall_and_rise_of_a_paradigmd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2251669...</a><br/><strong>West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Collapse Tipping Point Defined…</strong> This work out of the German National Science Institute describes marine ice sheet collapse mechanisms, and how there is a very distinct tipping point with the West Antarctic Ice Sheet where collapse becomes irreversible in about 2050. The very important take-away from this work is that to prevent ice sheet collapse the “perturbation” that creates the warming that is responsible for ice sheet collapse, which is mostly ocean warming, must end by at the latest 2050. This means that we must return ocean temperature to its preindustrial stable temperature by 2050. The challenge here is that it is much more difficult to cool the oceans than it is the atmosphere. Figure 3 shows the model runs that define the stable state in blue.<br/>Feldmann and Levermann, Collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet after local destabilization of the Amundsen Basin, PNAS, November 17, 2015.<br/><a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/112/46/14191.full.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.pnas.org/content/112/46/14191.full.pdf</a> <br/><strong>Dynamical Ice Sheet Collapse Modeling Arrives…</strong> The abstract from DeConto and Pollard states: “model coupling ice sheet and climate dynamics—including previously underappreciated processes linking atmospheric warming with hydrofracturing of buttressing ice shelves and structural collapse of marine-terminating ice cliffs—that is calibrated against Pliocene and Last Interglacial sea-level estimates and applied to future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Antarctica has the potential to contribute more than a metre of sea-level rise by 2100 and more than 13 metres by 2500, if emissions continue unabated.”<br/>DeConto and Pollard, Contribution of Antarctica to past and future sea level rise, Nature, March 31, 2016.<br/>Full: <a href=""http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2823837-DeConto-Pollard-2016-Contribution-of-Antarctica.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2823837-...</a> <br/><strong>Recent sea level rise rate jump…</strong> Sea level rise from 1900 to 1990 was about 1.5 mm per year and from 1990 to 2010 3.2 mm per year. Since 2010 there seems to have been a another jump in the sea level rise rate that puts it above 5 mm per year based on NOAA’s sea level data.<br/><a href=""http://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/sod/lsa/SeaLevelRise/LSA_SLR_timeseries.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/sod/lsa/SeaLeve...</a> <br/><strong>Antarctic Ice Shelves Deteriorating Rapidly…</strong> Ice shelves buttressing land ice in Antarctica have seen a dramatic decline in volume due to thinning and retreat. As the shelves thin from under ice melt, their ability to cling to surrounding land and grounded ice diminishes and ice flows faster from the interior. Part of the increase in ocean temperatures doing the melting is actually caused by increased sea ice coverage in Antarctica in recent decades. The increased sea ice itself is part of a melt water feedback where less salty (less dense) melt water floats on the surface of the ocean instead of mixing with saltier denser water below. The fresh water freezes faster and is responsible for more sea ice. The combination of increased sea ice and the fresh water cap decreases wind mixing of deep ocean waters into surface waters. This wind mixing is responsible for upwelling cold deep waters so less upwelling means that more heat is trapped in upper ocean waters. It is this upper ocean water that circulates beneath the ice shelves and causes the melt that destabilizes them and increase ice discharge.

The thinning is caused by increased circulation of warming ocean waters because the 3,000 foot-thick glacier has melted up off of its pinning ridge. Ocean circulation can now move far back into the ice sheet feeding the glacier in an over deepened sub glacial trough 30 miles wide extending 100 miles inland.<br/>Dutrieux et al., Pine Island glacier ice shelf melt distributed at kilometre scales, The Cryosphere, September 26, 2013.<br/><a href=""http://www.the-cryosphere.net/7/1543/2013/tc-7-1543-2013.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.the-cryosphere.net/7/1543/2013/tc-7-...</a> <br/><strong>NOAA's Ice Sheet Collapse Warning…</strong> This is an ""ostensible"" ice sheet collapse warning. In other words:  being such in appearance. In an interview in the Insurance Journal in April, Margaret Davidson, NOAA’s senior advisor for coastal inundation and resilience science and services said ""recent data that has been collected but has yet to be made official indicates sea levels could rise by roughly 3 meters or 9 feet [9.8 feet] by 2050-2060, far higher and quicker than current projections."" This report was widely discounted in the press and by theoretical ""experts"". Davidson further explained herself in an interview in ClimateCrocks--itself with a substantially questioning title "" New Sea Level Story May be a Step too Far"". The words of Davidson have great meaning however and completely negate any attempt at discounting her statements. ClimateCrocks posted a text obtained from Margaret Davidson of NOAA to Eric Holthaus of Slate, of which the following quote summarizes the pertinent information: “i explained the time lag between observations/data in the field and published approved scientific consensus of peer reviewed literature can be as much as 10 years. and as before, the next approved consensus will likely see a notable uptick in slr [sea level rise] guidance (based upon field work in the period ’05-13) as it will need to have been published by 2017 when the synthesis process begins anew. I am not a scientist, but hang with them a lot. referenced recent paper by Hansen et al (which suggested 3 to 5 meters by 2100 tho Hansen has been saying 5 meters for nearly 15 years.) current work re cryosphere and mass water balance, which is a more recent area of science work. and reports regarding current field observations as mentioned and discussed by experts at various scientific mtgs on presentation rooms an corridors within past 6 months. WA [West Antarctic Ice Sheet] deteriorating rapidly… portions of shelf are now ungrounded with a lens of water underneath like Greenland but different. actually said my personal opinion was 2 to 3 meters in the next 50 years (that 2100 was not a useful frame for most people.)”<br/>Jerger, RIMS 2016: Sea Level Rise Will Be Worse and Come Sooner, Insurance Journal, April 12, 2016.<br/><a href=""http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2016/04/12/405089.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2...</a> <br/>ClimateCrocks.com, Peter Sinclair, Caution: New Sea Level Story May be a Step too Far, April 21, 2016.<br/><a href=""https://climatecrocks.com/2016/04/21/caution-new-sea-level-story-may-be-a-step-too-far/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://climatecrocks.com/2016/04/21/caution-ne...</a><br/><br/><u><a href=""https://climatediscovery.org/This_Land_References.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">More References Here.</a></u>

(Click the image above for a larger view.)  ~ ~ ~ The Film ~ ~ ~ We were awash for 19 days in a tumultuous sea of mountains and forests, drifting a course through the heart of the U.S. Rockies on a 6,000-mile journey of observation. Across the Continental Divide 22 times we navigated our way up and down the spine of North America, making 22 camps and observing 19 national forests. Eighty-nine million acres of conifers--20 percent of western North American forests--were dead due to a native insect driven berserk because of warming. (From our field work 2015 log.)This is one of many abrupt changes happening already, that have been caused by delay, and masked by mistrust in climate scientists. Reform is stalled worse than any time in 30 years, and our inalienable right to a healthy climate is literally under attack. This funding campaign will help finish field work for our new film, and through the T-shirt perks (see them below), begin a national messaging campaign using our buddy Andy Surfer Bear and global warming psychology.Fifteen thousand miles of This Land Is Your Land -- Climate Change Across America, are already in the can. Next up with this funder are the final 15,000 miles, and an all-important trip to the Greenland Ice Sheet for repeat photography from our first film in 2008.Redkill, or forest mortality from pine bark beetle attack. All across the West, our forests are  under attack by a pine bark beetle that is out of control because of warming. Near Steamboat Lake State Park, north central Colorado.Global Warming Psychology -- Adventure, Discovery and Intrigue: The Solution to Climate PollutionWe break the obvious news that yes, 30 years of delay has made climate change much worse and far more risky. The delay has largely been caused by what research at Drexel and Stanford Universities label the Climate Change Counter Movement (CCCM), whose $900 million in annual funding has destroyed trust in climate scientists. (1) To restore trust and finally implement climate pollution reform, global warming psychology says ""Foremost, be innovative."" This film uses the psychology of adventure, discovery and intrigue, delivered with music and beauty, to discover the truth in disparaged science, and portray the simple solutions, dismissed due to mistrust.The messaging campaign? The psychology says that because climate change has never happened to our advanced civilization before, we do not understand what will happen. We have no memory of what we need to do. Because we do not know how to behave, unfamiliarity inhibits deep thought. Fear, paranoia, skepticism, doubt and delay are the result. For trust in climate science to return, new and unique communications strategies are needed. Our polar bears and messages, our prose and our images, and especially our music--good old rock, blues, jazz and folk--all embody this new psychology. Our BackgroundThe Climate Change Now Initiative is the oldest independent climate science education organization in the world. Founded in 2005, We specialize in reporting the latest climate science discoveries directly from academia, field investigation of climate impacts happening now, and global warming psychology. Bruce Melton, our principle resource, is a professional engineer, environmental researcher, and climate science outreach specialist with over 30 years of experience in critical environmental issues.

Click on the image for a high resolution image to see the redkill on the flanks of Grand Teton, the tallest peak.Climate Change Today: Not What You ThinkThe Climate Change Counter Movement has destroyed the ability of climate scientists to communicate not only their most important recent discoveries, but the simple basics too. With full implementation Paris Commitments of 80 percent emissions reductions, our climate warms, not cools, by up to triple what we have already endured, in just the next 35 to 45 years, and warming quintuples by 2100. (2)Climate scientists told us 30 years ago that if we did not act promptly there would be trouble, and this is where we find ourselves today. The delay has now allowed initiation of abrupt changes up to 100 years ahead of, and 100 times more extreme than projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. (3)South Padre Island, non-storm conditions: During the Spring and King Tides, beaches around the world are under water. The reason we don't hear about it more is that the beaches that almost everyone visits are artificially nourished with dredged sand.Abrupt Change: The New Era of Climate Pollution The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is collapsing. The Gulf Stream is shutting down. The Amazon has flipped from a carbon sink to a carbon source. (4, 5, 6)  These are not distant future climate change horrors stories. Thirty years of delay has taken its toll. These abrupt changes (and more) are all happening now and the science has been masked by this extraordinary debate caused by the CCCM. This ""movement"" has engendered so much doubt--even among believers--that warnings from the scientific community go unheeded, unheard, and  wrongly believed as being some part of a ""natural cycle."" This film, and the Climate Change Now Initiative, specialize in communicating the badly maligned basics, and poorly communicated recent discoveries.Dirt on the Greenland Ice Sheet from record melt in 2012, 32 miles onto the ice near Kangerlussuaq, 20 miles north  of the Arctic Circle.The dirt is eons of accumulated dust from as far away as Siberia and the biggest lake is almost a half mile across.  Google Digitalglobe, U.S. Geological Survey 2012. (link)Graciously, There Is Good News The same strategies that have created the disconnection between climate science and the rest of us have masked new discoveries about solutions. But climate scientists have basically had 30 years to research the solutions. We now have proven, cheap and unambiguous technologies to take excess carbon dioxide pollution directly out of our sky and make up for the difference that emissions reductions strategies, decarbonization, agricultural techniques, bio energy carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS), and all of the other strategies combined together cannot accomplish. (7) The 2013 IPCC even thought these technologies were important enough to include in their Summary for Policy Makers: ""climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial time scale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period.""In other words, we have to remove ""largely"" more than we emit every year. ""Paris"" is only reductions in emissions. We must remove more CO2 from the sky than we emit every year--largely more, regardless of costs. Fortunately, the costs are as manageable as many, many different things we do in our society every year.Carbon Engineering, Squamish, British Columbia: This first of its kind industrial scale facility uses WW II technology that kept our sailors alive in submarines by cleaning carbon dioxide from the air with lye.But the Climate Change Counter Movement has brought action to a standstill. We have the engineers to do the job, we have the emission reductions strategies to decarbonize our economy, but we cannot muster the will. If we can take action--almost immediately--and remove enough of the excess CO2 from our sky, abrupt changes that are initiating now will reverse. Failure to act however, as per NOAA in 2016, will result in ten feet of sea level rise in just the next 35 to 45 years. (8)  To break the stranglehold we need global warming psychology. If we can overcome this astonishingly ironic deadlock, we can fix the problem for as little money as we spend on advertising across the planet every year. (9)Global Thermostat, Menlo Park California. First generation designer amine process for removing carbon dioxide from the air. At this early stage of development this technology can remove 1 ton of CO2 for $75 using waste heat. As solar energy falls to $0.01 kWh by 2025 (it's $0.07 kWh now), costs will plummet.What We Do, What This Film Will DoAdventure, Discovery, Intrigue:  Global warming psychology says to show viewers what's really happening in the world. So we get out and get dirty. We go to where it is and bring it back. In July 2017, we depart for field work on the West Coast--with or without funding, although with a much reduced scope of work without funding. The challenge now is abrupt change, not the relatively slow 2100 projections that we have been practicing for. This is why our work is so important.To finally create action, the psychology says: Simplify communications. Minimize ambiguity. Instill trust in our scientists. Don't create fear. Create learning through innovation. Tell a story. Relate, don't dictate. Reveal the innocence of reality and magnitude of risk. Invite participation. And fundamentally, combine science with entertainment: If they aren't in their seats, they aren't listening.The most important part of our platform is our Knowledge Base and over 400 interpretations of academic literature almost completely unknown outside academia.  It's this knowledge base that our films and music are based upon. Climate change is out there and it is far more meaningful than we have been drilled into believing. It's also a rare, beautiful, and fascinating thing to behold. Abrupt changes have never happened to our advanced civilization, or even to our species, in time frames that matter. It's out there where you least expect it, more fantastic than can be imagined, waiting to be experienced.~ ~ ~ We Bring It! ~ ~ ~The Climate Change Now Initiative 501c3 was founded in 2005, – ClimateDiscovery.org -- Over 400 reports on the latest most critical science, innovative filmwork and good old blues, rock and folk music, that tells the complete story of climate change.Music Can Sooth The Climate BeastWhy music? It's innovative and global warming psychology says to communicate in ways that have not been tried before. Music is the universal language. Music heals. It relates through a different part of the brain. The psychology says this is good, our old pathways have become inured. Think about the blues. It's all bad in the blues, but we enjoy the blues as music. So, why not present climate change through music? And besides, how else would an organization from Austin do it?!The band has been together since 2002. We love the blues. This film will sooth your soul. It uses the advanced global warming psychology technique of presenting through the lens of music. The redkill pine forest above is a common site across the American West. Usually blamed on natural occurrence by unsuspecting news people victimized by the Climate Change Counter Movement and their insistence on ""fair and balanced"" reporting,  these are actual abrupt climate change impacts, that have happen every time our climate changed abruptly. Climate Change Across America Field Work 2017In 2015 and 2016 we completed 15,000 miles of filming, observing beetle kill in the Rockies, drought kill in Texas, all sorts of mortality in the Chihuahuan Desert, and sea level rise and dune erosion on the Padre Island wilderness beach--the world's longest barrier island. Another 15,000 miles in the U.S. and Canada is on the books for summer and fall 2017, plus an all important trip to Greenland. This work builds upon our previous two films, The Ice and the Sea, Abrupt Climate Change Happening Now (2008) (22,000 views!) and What Have We Done: The North American Pine Beetle Pandemic (2009).  This new 15,000 miles of fieldwork has four focus areas:
Document the effect of West Coast beetle kill in the Sierra Nevada and Cascades after their record drought, focusing on the  most vulnerably high altitude areas.
Visit leading atmospheric carbon dioxide removal scientists and showcase their advanced work on industrial scale field trials with Global Thermostat, Carbon Engineering and associated scientists from Columbia University, University of Arizona, University of Calgary, and Carnegie Mellon University.

Global Warming T-shirt Psychology Messaging CampaignBecause we have never experienced meaningful climate change before, it's an innate response to the unknown to be suspicious, doubting and even fearful. This inhibits deep thought. After seeing the plight of the polar bear for going on 30 years now, the polar bear image has become ingrained in our minds as being related to climate change. Global warming psychology says that even just the sight of a climate change icon initiates thought in our brains. As neurons blink, our minds grow more comfortable with the topic. As our comfort levels increase, our ability to have rational thought increases too, and the tactics of the Climate Change Counter Movement can be defeated!You can see more about the psychology here at our almost completed eCommerce site.

Borderless or with a border for matting. With or without caption.Supporter -- Teton Red...  At the foot of the Tetons, the beetle has impacted less than half the trees. The same can't be said for the white pine in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem however. Over 90 percent of this species, which provides a major source of food for grizzlies, were wiped out.Supporter -- Groundhog Park, Spruce Beetle Attack... This astonishing attack took out 100,000 acres in three years beginning 2012. It's in south Central Colorado in the La Garita Mountains above 11,000 feet. The peak in the background is Mesa Mountain, elevation 12,944 feet. This forest is (was) almost all Englemann spruce except for the fringe along the road of young blue spruce, which are less susceptible to the spruce beetle than the mature Englemanns.Supporter -- Underice River, Point 660... Point 660 is WW II code for this remote area that is literally at the end of the longest road in Greenland (only 18 miles long!). The underice river is at the heart of the area that is melting the fastest in Greenland, at up to 30 vertical feet per year. It's along the west coast, 200 miles south of the Arctic Circle, east from Kangerlussuaq, or Bluie West as this vitally important airfield was known in WWII.Supporter -- Padre Mile 11, Surf in the Dunes, South Padre Sea Level Rise...  Apply named The Narrows, at mile 13 beyond the end of pavement the four-wheel drive trail disappears into the surf. Sea level rise during normal high tides has outpaced the natural beach regeneration process, and beach disintegration has begun.Supporter -- Padre Mile 14, Missing BeachSouth Padre Mile 14...  Normal high tide on South Padre Island. At the turn of the century, the beach on most of Padre during normal, non storm high tides, was one to two hundred feet wide, with some places greater than 300 feet.Supporter -- Padre Mile 15, Beach Erosion... Up South Padre, in the pristine wilderness beyond the end of the road, the beach is almost gone. Erosion from sea level rise during non-storm conditions has overwhelmed the natural beach regenerative process.Supporter -- PINS Mile 50, Padre Island National Seashore, 50 miles beyond the four-wheel drive only sign... Sand starvation from dams on rivers and natural subsidence from sediment compaction are challenging enough for our beaches. Add sea level rise and the beach disintegration threshold has already been passed in critical areas like this one where the beach is non-existent at high tide.Supporter -- The Flats, Padre Island National Seashore... They are (were) located on the back side of Padre Island and were once nearly a mile wide at the widest. These flats disappeared with the sea level jump along the Texas Coast in 2013, and then again in 2016. This time they may be gone for good.Supporter -- RMNP Westgate, Rocky Mountain National Park Westgate Entry Monument... the mountain pine bark beetle, dendroctonus ponderosae, has devastated the western half of Rocky Mountain National Park. All total, 89 million acres had been consumed across the American West with 60 to 90 percent mortality by 2013 when the attack began to wain. Now, spruce beetles, fir beetles and budworms are attacking across the West in epidemic proportions.Supporter -- Ice Sheet Muskoxe... The massive Greenland Ice Sheet overhangs its terminal moraine east of Kangerlussuaq, near the Arctic Circle. The distinct boundary between dirty and clean ice was caused by an abrupt climate change. The white ice overides darker ice from an ice age pulse where windier conditions created dirtier ice. The ice on the left remains in equilibrium because it overhangs the terminal moraine. On the right, recent ice sheet retreat is evident.What'll We Do If We Don't Get Funded?Continue on of course. Melton has been funding this work from his meager engineering revenues for a dozen years, but it's a lot more difficult today. Melton Engineering's traditional land development clients have evaporated after learning Melton was an evil environmentalist. But Melton Engineering was rebranded in 2013 to cater to residential and commercial clients who have been impacted by the repeated rainbombs in Central Texas.After the rebranding, there was enough revenue to fund 7,500 miles a year of filming in 2015 and 2016 and this will probably be the case in 2017 without additional funding. But because of abrupt change initiation, we don't have the time remaining to delay and certainly not the funds to do 15,000 miles this year and get to Greenland. Please get a T-shirt or twelve and help save the world! Most important: Share on Facebook and Twitter.Production Regardless of funding, we will get a short film out about the successful industrial scale direct air capture processes by this fall. If we make our goal, fingers crossed to make the film festival entries in spring 2018.The band is going into production in August or September, depending on Greenland.Another tour we have planned if we don't get fully funded is a 4x4 trek up and down Padre Island during the King Tide in October. It's just a few hours from Austin and can be executed with just engineering revenues. The beach was closed at Padre Island National Seashore due to high water five times during non storm conditions in 2016.Bottom line: if we do not reach our funding goal, there's still Melton Engineering. There is no reason why we would stop now. This is too important. We'll get there, but it will not likely to be until 2019. So tell your friends. Abrupt change waits for nobody.Other Ways You Can Help!

Climate Change Counter Movement… From 2003 to 2010, $7 billion in climate change counter-movement funding has been identified from revenues reported in IRS tax returns for 91 of 118 organizations and institutions identified in the academic literature as being involved. The research from Drexel and Stanford concludes: “With delay and obfuscation as their goals, the U.S. CCCM has been quite successful in recent decades. However, the key actors in this cultural and political conflict are not just the “experts” who appear in the media spotlight. The roots of climate-change denial go deeper, because individuals’ efforts have been bankrolled and directed by organizations that receive sustained support from foundations and funders known for their overall commitments to conservative causes. Thus to fully understand the opposition to climate change legislation, we need to focus on the institutionalized efforts that have built and maintain this organized campaign. Just as in a theatrical show, there are stars in the spotlight. In the drama of climate change, these are often prominent contrarian scientists or conservative politicians, such as Senator James Inhofe. However, they are only the most visible and transparent parts of a larger production. Supporting this effort are directors, script writers, and, most importantly, a series of producers, in the form of conservative foundations. Clarifying the institutional dynamics of the CCCM can aid our understanding of how anthropogenic climate change has been turned into a controversy rather than a scientific fact in the U.S.” A criticism of this theory is that the conservative political platform funded also supports other issues such as right to life, reduced government and regulations, illegal immigration, lower taxes and etc. Fundamentally however, because the platform supported by this funding is all encompassing, the entire funding supports climate change denial equally to the other parts of the platform.Brulle 2013, Drexel and Stanford -- Institutionalizing delay: foundation funding and the creation of U.S. climate change counter-movement organizations,"" December 21, 2013.Melton, Climate Discovery.org -- The Climate Change Counter-Movement: $7 Billion Umbrella, February 17, 2014.Melton, Truthout.org -- Buoyed by Trump, the Climate Change Counter-Movement Gains Momentum, May 19, 2017.Media Bias and the Conservative Media… Work from McGill, Drexel and Bucknell Universities expands on previous work on the causes of the partisan divide among climate science believers. Their findings are that the media have the most important influencing effect on the public mind with the biased coverage of climate science by the most popular politically conservative media outlets carrying the largest load of responsibility.Carmichael et al., The great divide, understanding the role of media and other drivers of the partisan divide in public concern over climate change in the USA, 2001–2014 Climatic Change, January 31, 2017.https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joanna_Hux...Corporate funding and Climate Change Bias… Work From Yale on 164 organizations identified as being a part of the Climate Change Counter Movement from 1993–2013 evaluated their oral and written outreach of 40,785 texts (written and oral presentations) and more than 39 million words and found that; ""organizations with corporate funding were more likely to have written and disseminated texts meant to polarize the climate change issue. Second, and more importantly, that corporate funding influences the actual thematic content of these polarization efforts.""Farrell, Corporate funding and ideological polarization about climate change, PNAS, January 5, 2016.http://www.pnas.org/content/113/1/92.full.pdfFairness Bias in Liberal Media… From the University of California Santa Cruz and American University, Boykoff and Boykoff find that not only are conservative media outlets far more likely to vastly downplay climate change risks, but that liberal media outlets too are also more likely to downplay climate change risks. It's has been subsequently labelled the ""Fairness Bias"" and the way it works is this: in journalists' quest to be fair and present both sides of the story, they feel compelled by their journalistic ethics to report both sides of the story equally and let the consumer determine their own answer. This generally works well with issue based discussions where only morals and ethics are involved. But when facts are involved, and ""alternative"" facts exist that are supported by only three percent of the climate science community or less, and those facts are presented by the media equally to the 97 percent of climate scientists facts that have been proven true, a conflict results where the consumer bases his or her interpretation on the quantity of information presented. To them, it seems like the science remains unsettled, when the reality is just the opposite.Boykkoff and Boykkoff Balance as bias global warming and the US prestige press Global Environmental Change volume 14 2004.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248556... 2)    Current Policy doubles to triples warming we have already endured…  The IPCC’s new Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario of RCP2.6, is basically the same thing as 80 percent emissions reductions by 2050 and is described by the IPCC as a “strong mitigation scenario.” RCP2.6 has CO2 peaking at about 440 ppm between 2050 and 2060 and temperature at 1.5 degree C 30 to 40 years later. The increase of 1.6 degrees C is double the current warming since the 1700s. This increase however is the average increase. The worst-case RCP2.6 warming is 2.7 degrees C or more than triple current warming. Considering the understating nature of the IPCC consensus (See Reference 7), the upper limits should be strongly considered as a distinctly plausible. Under the average RCP2.6 modeling and 1.6 degrees of warming with aggressive emissions reductions, the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere does not fall below today’s level until after 2150, and does not return to preindustrial era temperature until long after the year 3000. Under the most extreme RCP2.6 limits with 2.7 degrees of warming above preindustrial times, Earth’s temperature does not fall below our current temperature for well over a 1,000 years.Meinshausen et al., The RCP greenhouse gas concentrations and their extensions from 1765 to 2300, Climatic Change, November 2011, figure 6. http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs105...MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change – Results of Paris… With the Paris Agreement fully implemented on schedule, we can expect 3.5 C of warming by 2100 and with additional negative emissions technologies studied of BECSS (bio-energy with carbon capture and storage--not direct air capture) the increase in warming is held back to 2.4 to 2.7 C by 2100. At 2050, Paris alone is 2.1 C warming. 2014 was 0.69 C. The record 2015 and 2016 global average was 0.87 C and 0.94 C. However, 2015 and 2016 were influenced by a record, or near record El Nino, a natural climate fluctuation. Sokolov et al., Scenarios of Global Change - Integrated Assessment of Climate Impacts, MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, Report 291, February 2016.https://globalchange.mit.edu/sites/default/file... ​3. Abrupt change up to 100 years ahead of schedule and 100 times more extreme than the IPCC projected… It is difficult to quantify how much more extreme abrupt change is than the slow changes projected by the IPCC because of many different things: we have never experienced these types of impacts before (sea level jumps, shut down of the Gulf Stream, Amazon flip from sink to source, dynamic collapse of ice sheets. Their unrecoverable nature lends itself poorly to comparisons with a stable and advanced society. Two illustrations are offered: (A) Antarctic ice loss has begun 100 years ahead of schedule… Antarctic ice loss (surface mass balance, SMB) in the 2007 IPCC Report was supposed to increase, not decrease, for all scenarios, through 2100. This means that snow accumulation was supposed to be more than melt, evaporation and iceberg discharge combined. The 213 IPCC report however, tells us that Antarctic ice loss has already begun,  is substantially large, and approaching the volume of discharge in Greenland.   (B) 100 times more extreme… Abrupt temperature change has occurred 23 times in the last 100,000 years of 9 to 14 degrees F globally and 25 to 35 F in Greenland. The changes generally took decades, but the most extreme occurred in just two to three years. When compared to a world that limits warming to a middle of the road scenario of 3 degrees C (5.4 F) by 2100, 14 F in 2 years is 107 times more extreme.(A) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Fourth Assessment Report, Climate Change 2007: Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis, 10.6.5, Projections of Global Average Sea Level Change for the 21st Century, Table 10.7.http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10s10-6-5.html The 2013 IPCC report tells us that Antarctic ice loss has almost caught up with Greenland… Summary for Policy Makers, B.3 Cryosphere, page 9, second and third bullets. http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf(B) Alley, Wally Was Right - Predictive ability of the North Atlantic Conveyor Belt Hypothesis for Abrupt Climate Change, Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Science, February 2007, Figure 1 shows the 23 abrupt climate changes.http://shadow.eas.gatech.edu/~kcobb/abrupt/alley07.pdf Two to three years…  -- see also:Steffensen et al., High-Resolution Greenland Ice Core Data Show Abrupt Climate Change Happens in Few Years, Science Express, June 12 2008, page three, final paragraph.http://www.sciencemag.org/content/321/5889/680.abstract4. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is collapsing… For a detailed treatment of this topic with 20 references and 30 citations see our article: Collapse of West Antarctic Ice Sheet Reveals Inadequacy of Current Climate Strategies, December 16, 2016. http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/38794-collap... Specific citations for "" The West Antarctic ice Sheet is collapsing""…West Antarctic Ice Sheet Collapse Began Shortly After the Turn of the Century… Vaughan summarized the science around West Antarctic Ice Sheet Collapse beginning in 1981. While the mechanisms for ocean melt were present in publication from the early 1990s, it was not until the early 2000s that work first showed definitive evidence of thinning, grounding line retreat, and ice stream acceleration in one of the most sensitive area of West Antarctica, the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Vaughan concludes that if these symptoms are indeed precursors to collapse, then collapse has begun. From what we know today, he was absolutely correct. Vaughan, West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse – the fall and rise of a paradigm, Climatic Change, 2008, see the abstract.http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2251669...West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Collapse Tipping Point Defined… This work out of the German National Science Institute describes marine ice sheet collapse mechanisms, and how there is a very distinct tipping point with the West Antarctic Ice Sheet where collapse becomes irreversible in about 2050. The very important take-away from this work is that to prevent ice sheet collapse the “perturbation” that creates the warming that is responsible for ice sheet collapse, which is mostly ocean warming, must end by at the latest 2050. This means that we must return ocean temperature to its preindustrial stable temperature by 2050. The challenge here is that it is much more difficult to cool the oceans than it is the atmosphere. Figure 3 shows the model runs that define the stable state in blue.Feldmann and Levermann, Collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet after local destabilization of the Amundsen Basin, PNAS, November 17, 2015.http://www.pnas.org/content/112/46/14191.full.pdf Dynamical Ice Sheet Collapse Modeling Arrives… The abstract from DeConto and Pollard states: “model coupling ice sheet and climate dynamics—including previously underappreciated processes linking atmospheric warming with hydrofracturing of buttressing ice shelves and structural collapse of marine-terminating ice cliffs—that is calibrated against Pliocene and Last Interglacial sea-level estimates and applied to future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Antarctica has the potential to contribute more than a metre of sea-level rise by 2100 and more than 13 metres by 2500, if emissions continue unabated.”DeConto and Pollard, Contribution of Antarctica to past and future sea level rise, Nature, March 31, 2016.Full: http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2823837-... Recent sea level rise rate jump… Sea level rise from 1900 to 1990 was about 1.5 mm per year and from 1990 to 2010 3.2 mm per year. Since 2010 there seems to have been a another jump in the sea level rise rate that puts it above 5 mm per year based on NOAA’s sea level data.http://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/sod/lsa/SeaLeve... Antarctic Ice Shelves Deteriorating Rapidly… Ice shelves buttressing land ice in Antarctica have seen a dramatic decline in volume due to thinning and retreat. As the shelves thin from under ice melt, their ability to cling to surrounding land and grounded ice diminishes and ice flows faster from the interior. Part of the increase in ocean temperatures doing the melting is actually caused by increased sea ice coverage in Antarctica in recent decades. The increased sea ice itself is part of a melt water feedback where less salty (less dense) melt water floats on the surface of the ocean instead of mixing with saltier denser water below. The fresh water freezes faster and is responsible for more sea ice. The combination of increased sea ice and the fresh water cap decreases wind mixing of deep ocean waters into surface waters. This wind mixing is responsible for upwelling cold deep waters so less upwelling means that more heat is trapped in upper ocean waters. It is this upper ocean water that circulates beneath the ice shelves and causes the melt that destabilizes them and increase ice discharge. Paolo et al., Volume loss from Antarctic ice shelves is accelerating, Science Express, March 25, 2016.http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/~klinck/Reprints/PDF/pa... Up to 100 meters (328 feet) of Under Ice Melt per year… The Pine Island Glacier at the Amundsen Sea Embayment, often referred to as the keystone of West Antarctic Ice Sheet Collapse, is thinning from under ice melt at a rate that is up to 100 meters per year (328 feet). The thinning is caused by increased circulation of warming ocean waters because the 3,000 foot-thick glacier has melted up off of its pinning ridge. Ocean circulation can now move far back into the ice sheet feeding the glacier in an over deepened sub glacial trough 30 miles wide extending 100 miles inland.Dutrieux et al., Pine Island glacier ice shelf melt distributed at kilometre scales, The Cryosphere, September 26, 2013.http://www.the-cryosphere.net/7/1543/2013/tc-7-... NOAA's Ice Sheet Collapse Warning… This is an ""ostensible"" ice sheet collapse warning. In other words:  being such in appearance. In an interview in the Insurance Journal in April, Margaret Davidson, NOAA’s senior advisor for coastal inundation and resilience science and services said ""recent data that has been collected but has yet to be made official indicates sea levels could rise by roughly 3 meters or 9 feet [9.8 feet] by 2050-2060, far higher and quicker than current projections."" This report was widely discounted in the press and by theoretical ""experts"". Davidson further explained herself in an interview in ClimateCrocks--itself with a substantially questioning title "" New Sea Level Story May be a Step too Far"". The words of Davidson have great meaning however and completely negate any attempt at discounting her statements. ClimateCrocks posted a text obtained from Margaret Davidson of NOAA to Eric Holthaus of Slate, of which the following quote summarizes the pertinent information: “i explained the time lag between observations/data in the field and published approved scientific consensus of peer reviewed literature can be as much as 10 years. and as before, the next approved consensus will likely see a notable uptick in slr [sea level rise] guidance (based upon field work in the period ’05-13) as it will need to have been published by 2017 when the synthesis process begins anew. I am not a scientist, but hang with them a lot. referenced recent paper by Hansen et al (which suggested 3 to 5 meters by 2100 tho Hansen has been saying 5 meters for nearly 15 years.) current work re cryosphere and mass water balance, which is a more recent area of science work. and reports regarding current field observations as mentioned and discussed by experts at various scientific mtgs on presentation rooms an corridors within past 6 months. WA [West Antarctic Ice Sheet] deteriorating rapidly… portions of shelf are now ungrounded with a lens of water underneath like Greenland but different. actually said my personal opinion was 2 to 3 meters in the next 50 years (that 2100 was not a useful frame for most people.)”Jerger, RIMS 2016: Sea Level Rise Will Be Worse and Come Sooner, Insurance Journal, April 12, 2016.http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2... ClimateCrocks.com, Peter Sinclair, Caution: New Sea Level Story May be a Step too Far, April 21, 2016.https://climatecrocks.com/2016/04/21/caution-ne...More References Here.",39.0,0,"2 Campaigns

passionnés d’architecture à l’origine d’ONOB Project respectivement
française et québécois. Alice, étudiante en première année de master à l’École
Nationale Supérieure d’Architecture de Paris-Malaquais et François-Luc, diplômé

<p>ONOB (Or Noir et Ours Blancs) est
un projet de recherche qui porte sur le pipeline de l’Alaska. Ce dernier
traverse l’Etat sur près de 1300km, longé par une route sur toute sa distance :
il s’agit de comprendre la relation que cet oléoduc et ses infrastructures
associées entretiennent avec le territoire sauvage qu’ils traversent,
particulièrement avec la faune unique de l’Etat.</p><p>Nous abordons cette
problématique en la faisant systématiquement graviter autour de ces deux mêmes
questions: de quelle manière des architectes auraient pu être impliqués dans
l’existence de ces infrastructures et en quoi une participation de leur part
aurait été (ou serait) bénéfique ?</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>Pourquoi ce thème ?</h3>
<p>Nous sommes au jour où les hommes et la société
prennent conscience de l’impact qu’ils ont sur l’environnement (pour la deuxième fois depuis la fin des années 1960). </p><p>Au jour où la COP21 de Paris a mis
en évidence les enjeux politiques et sociaux que représentent le changement
actuel du climat.</p>
<p>Au jour où le cours du pétrole n’a jamais été
aussi bas et où de surcroit il devient de plus en plus pressant de trouver des
ressources d’énergie alternatives. Au moment où l’Amérique du Nord refuse
d’installer le 4ème tronçon du XL Keystone pipeline faisant battre la
controverse à son plein.</p>
<p>Nous en sommes pour certains à une nouvelle
ère, géologique, sociale, idéo- logique... à un tournant de l’histoire de
l’humanité où les décisions prises ont le pouvoir de changer considérablement
le cours des choses, et où les mauvais choix auront des impacts graves et
irréversibles...</p><p>Il nous semble indispensable de nous intéresser à ce thème et de travailler dessus, en tant qu'architectes mais aussi en tant qu'individus.</p><br/>
<h3>Pourquoi cet oléoduc ?</h3>
<p>Vu du ciel, le 49ème État étasunien présente
une frontière, une coupure, une balafre qui divise en deux le territoire sur
plusieurs centaines de kilomètres au milieu de la nature sauvage. Il s’agit
du pipeline de l’Alaska qui depuis 1977 traverse l’Etat pour acheminer une
importante quantité de pétrole vers le reste des Etats-Unis. </p><p>Il part de Prudhoe
Bay, champ pétrolier à l’extrême Nord, dans les terres les plus éloignées et
inaccessibles du territoire pour arriver à la ville de Valdez, tout au sud,
où les populations humaines sont les plus établies.</p>
<p>La nature et la diversité des 1300 kilomètres
traversés par l’oléoduc ont immédiatement suscité des controverses, notamment
à propos des questions environnementales de protection des écosystèmes uniques
de l’Etat. Cependant, il semble que le projet de ces infrastructures ait
parcouru un chemin parsemé de très peu d’embûches avant de voir le jour puis de
transporter en quasi-permanence depuis bientôt 40 ans des millions de m3 de
pétrole.</p>
<p>Ces infrastructures ont été très largement
étudiées par des scientifiques de différents domaines depuis leur mise en place
pour répondre à la crise pétrolière de 1973 mais très peu (voire pas du tout)
par des architectes.</p>
<p>La recherche d’ONOB entend profiter de
l’unicité de ce pipeline pour réfléchir aux implications possibles des
architectes et à la réflexion territoriale dans la mise en place de telles
infrastructures.</p>
<p>Le <i>Trans-Alaska Pipeline System </i>présente
des spécificités relatives à des questions politiques, économiques,
scientifiques, sociales, écologiques, historiques... ce qui en fait un cas d’étude
extraordinaire.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>Le voyage</h3>
<p>Nous rendre sur place en Alaska pendant un mois
s’avère être une étape indispen- sable pour alimenter judicieusement notre
recherche.</p>
<p>Le voyage aura pour but premier de suivre la
route de l’oléoduc sur ses 1300 km, de Valdez à Prudhoe Bay.? Lors de ce
cheminement en voiture, il s’agira d’observer le pipeline et ses <i>highways </i>avec
leur dimension de support de transport à travers le territoire, et de découvrir les infrastructures et édifices qui y sont inévitablement liés le long
de la route (stations de pompages, petites pistes d’atterrissage, rares
auberges, une <i>field station </i>de l’institut de biologie arctique, etc.).</p>
<p>En plus des observations directes, un séjour
permettra de rencontrer et d’organiser des interviews avec des acteurs centraux

<p></p></div>","ENGLISH VERSION : https://issuu.com/onobproject/docs/onob_indiegogoBrève présentation Alice Weil et François-Luc Giraldeau, deux
passionnés d’architecture à l’origine d’ONOB Project respectivement
française et québécois. Alice, étudiante en première année de master à l’École
Nationale Supérieure d’Architecture de Paris-Malaquais et François-Luc, diplômé
de l’école d’architecture de l’Université McGill à Montréal. 
ONOB (Or Noir et Ours Blancs) est
un projet de recherche qui porte sur le pipeline de l’Alaska. Ce dernier
traverse l’Etat sur près de 1300km, longé par une route sur toute sa distance :
il s’agit de comprendre la relation que cet oléoduc et ses infrastructures
associées entretiennent avec le territoire sauvage qu’ils traversent,
particulièrement avec la faune unique de l’Etat.Nous abordons cette
problématique en la faisant systématiquement graviter autour de ces deux mêmes
questions: de quelle manière des architectes auraient pu être impliqués dans
l’existence de ces infrastructures et en quoi une participation de leur part
aurait été (ou serait) bénéfique ?
Pourquoi ce thème ?
Nous sommes au jour où les hommes et la société
prennent conscience de l’impact qu’ils ont sur l’environnement (pour la deuxième fois depuis la fin des années 1960). Au jour où la COP21 de Paris a mis
en évidence les enjeux politiques et sociaux que représentent le changement
actuel du climat.
Au jour où le cours du pétrole n’a jamais été
aussi bas et où de surcroit il devient de plus en plus pressant de trouver des
ressources d’énergie alternatives. Au moment où l’Amérique du Nord refuse
d’installer le 4ème tronçon du XL Keystone pipeline faisant battre la
controverse à son plein.
Nous en sommes pour certains à une nouvelle
ère, géologique, sociale, idéo- logique... à un tournant de l’histoire de
l’humanité où les décisions prises ont le pouvoir de changer considérablement
le cours des choses, et où les mauvais choix auront des impacts graves et
irréversibles...Il nous semble indispensable de nous intéresser à ce thème et de travailler dessus, en tant qu'architectes mais aussi en tant qu'individus.
Pourquoi cet oléoduc ?
Vu du ciel, le 49ème État étasunien présente
une frontière, une coupure, une balafre qui divise en deux le territoire sur
plusieurs centaines de kilomètres au milieu de la nature sauvage. Il s’agit
du pipeline de l’Alaska qui depuis 1977 traverse l’Etat pour acheminer une
importante quantité de pétrole vers le reste des Etats-Unis. Il part de Prudhoe
Bay, champ pétrolier à l’extrême Nord, dans les terres les plus éloignées et
inaccessibles du territoire pour arriver à la ville de Valdez, tout au sud,
où les populations humaines sont les plus établies.
La nature et la diversité des 1300 kilomètres
traversés par l’oléoduc ont immédiatement suscité des controverses, notamment
à propos des questions environnementales de protection des écosystèmes uniques
de l’Etat. Cependant, il semble que le projet de ces infrastructures ait
parcouru un chemin parsemé de très peu d’embûches avant de voir le jour puis de
transporter en quasi-permanence depuis bientôt 40 ans des millions de m3 de
pétrole.
Ces infrastructures ont été très largement
étudiées par des scientifiques de différents domaines depuis leur mise en place
pour répondre à la crise pétrolière de 1973 mais très peu (voire pas du tout)
par des architectes.
La recherche d’ONOB entend profiter de
l’unicité de ce pipeline pour réfléchir aux implications possibles des
architectes et à la réflexion territoriale dans la mise en place de telles
infrastructures.
Le Trans-Alaska Pipeline System présente
des spécificités relatives à des questions politiques, économiques,
scientifiques, sociales, écologiques, historiques... ce qui en fait un cas d’étude
extraordinaire.
Le voyage
Nous rendre sur place en Alaska pendant un mois
s’avère être une étape indispen- sable pour alimenter judicieusement notre
recherche.
Le voyage aura pour but premier de suivre la
route de l’oléoduc sur ses 1300 km, de Valdez à Prudhoe Bay.? Lors de ce
cheminement en voiture, il s’agira d’observer le pipeline et ses highways avec
leur dimension de support de transport à travers le territoire, et de découvrir les infrastructures et édifices qui y sont inévitablement liés le long
de la route (stations de pompages, petites pistes d’atterrissage, rares
auberges, une field station de l’institut de biologie arctique, etc.).
En plus des observations directes, un séjour
permettra de rencontrer et d’organiser des interviews avec des acteurs centraux
dans l’histoire, la construction et la vie du pipeline. Il est donc prévu de
rencontrer lors du mois passé en Alaska :
– des membres de différentes ONG environnementales à Anchorage et Fairbanks
– des membres d’institutions gouverne- mentales
– des autochtones des villages arctiques
– des acteurs de l’exploitation pétrolière
En plus de la recherche écrite qui se matérialisera sous la forme d'un document illustré d'une centaine de pages, nous réaliserons un moyen-métrage documentaire d'environ 30 minutes à notre retour, grâce aux données recueillies sur place.Le budgetVols

<p>The project is to safeguard a 5.9 acres (about 2.38 hectare) land which is an important wildlife corridor.  It is located along the Kinabatangan, Sabah’s longest river, in the eastern part of Malaysian Borneo.

Much of the land in the lower floodplain are being converted to palm oil plantation by external investors and other minor human activities carried out by the local villagers. This has caused major habitat fragmentation and also decreases food source especially for Borneo Pygmy Elephants. Hence, increases wildlife conflicts such as crop raiding by elephants and Orang Utans with land owners and village settlements. Within the floodplain, about 26,000 hectare of fragmented forests are protected as the lower Kinabatangan wildlife sanctuary. <br/></p>
<p>Rasig is also located on one of the critical bottlenecks for elephant movement, and adjacent to the lower Kinabatangan wildlife sanctuary. Borneo Pygmy Elephants that cross the river from the other side of the wildlife sanctuary to this side will use Rasig to get to the next forest reserve and vice versa. The herd usually congregates within the land for several days, to feed and play in the swamp forest before moving on. This makes it an ideal wildlife safe-house where elephants and other wildlife can be monitored for injuries or even new birth. </p>

<p>Other wildlife that were being observed frequenting Rasig includes wild Orang Utans, rare reddish form silver langurs, leopard cats and wild boars. There are abundance of fig trees along the riverbank. Figs are major food source for birds especially hornbills, Orang Utans and fishes. Recently, the White Fronted Falconet, Borneo's smallest bird of prey was spotted in the area too. When the water level is low, the sandbank is visible on the northwestern side of the land, which is also a breeding and resting ground for estuarine crocodiles.</p>
<p>The land owner, who is also a fisherman, has voluntarily agreed to protect his land, pledging no development that may affect the wildlife corridor. It is possibly the first pragmatic move by a local villager in making such commitment. Most villagers, whose income are affected by depletion of fisheries, would have sold their land to agriculture companies for huge profit. </p>

<p>There are a lot more to be done. So, this campaign is to raise enough funds to build the local capacity, to enable local villagers to manage their own land for nature conservation and to generate sustainable income through ecotourism activities. </p>

<p><b><br/><b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""></b></b></p>
<h4>What we need:</h4>
<p>We need your help to raise US$34,000.00 to make this happen, although any amount of money donated is appreciated. </p>
<p>We have already started to raise some to cover the startup including promotional and marketing materials but your contribution will go directly to the following that will create a huge impact not just to the area but the region:</p>
<p>#1. Three months preliminary survey and assessment of the 5.9 acres land headed by a wildlife biologist. It is essential to link local and scientific knowledge to promote sustainable tourism and the environment. Survey and assessment include forest inventory, wildlife assessment to identify type of wildlife accessing the area, identifying possible habitat restoration after classification and forest condition are identified. Amount: US$ 6,500.00</p>
<p>#2. Two field assistants from the local communities to assist with the three months assessment. Amount: US$ 3,500.00</p>
<p>#3. Field equipments for assessment and survey (include 3 compasses, 3 binoculars, 3 units of GPS). Amount: US$ 1,800.00</p>
<p>#4. Boat transportation with boatman and fuel for field survey and assessment. Amount: US$ 1,500.00</p>
<p>#5. Construction of an inland tower for long term wildlife monitoring (approximately 7 meters high, 4 feet by 8 feet, including manpower, transportation and materials). Amount: US$ 4,500.00</p>
<p>#6. Construction of a floating jetty for embarkation and disembarkation, and riverside observation of elephant crossing from the river and other wildlife (approximately about 8 meters by 6 meters, including manpower, transportation and materials). Amount: US$5,500.00</p>
<p>#7. Three camera traps inclusive of storage cards and batteries, to document wildlife presence, behaviours and other important data that may be of help for wildlife conservation of the area. Each camera will be placed in strategic areas. Amount: US$ 3,000.00</p>
<p>#8. A two day workshop to develop a set of guideline for responsible ecotourism activities and training for long term wildlife monitoring. Participants include the land owner and local communities who will also be our team of naturalist guides. Amount: US$ 1,600.00</p>
<p>#9. One local villager trained to collect data from camera traps and to do wildlife monitoring - 12 months wage. Amount: US$ 4,200.00</p>
<p>#10. Food source plot -  The preliminary planting of food source for wildlife such as Borneo Pygmy Elephants and Orang Utans would include banana trees, fig trees and other plants that are native to the area. This includes boat transportation, seedlings, and manpower. Amount: US$ 1,900.00</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h4>The Impact:</h4>
<p>Support this campaign to protect not just the lower Kinabatangan floodplain, or Borneo, but our planet. Your contribution will make this happen! Help the Borneo Pygmy Elephants, Orang Utans and other wildlife to safeguard their habitat. The success of this campaign will enable us to jumpstart all the tasks and activities required. We believe that this project has the potential to be replicated or applied locally and perhaps regionally and globally in areas that combine nature conservation and ecotourism.</p>

I work with local communities and NGOs in Asia to develop ecotourism projects. I help them with fundraising and also provide them with marketing support through Indie Travellers (www.indietravellers.com), a company that I set up for this purpose.  I am also a conservation and travel photographer. 
Prior to setting out on my own, I have spend most of my career life in the Kinabatangan floodplain, promoting nature-based tourism as well as ecotourism as a tour operator and later with WWF as a communicator and a fundraiser for a project on sustainable management of wetlands. 

The Kinabatangan - Rasig project, in the eastern part of Sabah on the island of Borneo, is the current community-based ecotourism project that I am working on. This project is a collaboration with Mr Mursalin Abdullah, a local community from the village of Sukau.

This project hopes to serve as a platform to attain conservation results through ecotourism with participation and support from the local community.  



Your contribution in any form will help us achieve our objectives as follows:

1)  To build local capabilities in ecotourism in relation to wildlife and habitat conservation
2)  To enhance the knowledge of wildlife ecology in degraded habitat
3) To promote and to communicate nature conservation to target audience through ecotourism activities
4)  Ensure direct benefit and equitable distribution of tourism opportunities to the local communities




6) Develop a set of guidelines for responsible wildlife tourism activities (control carrying capacity, code of ethics)
7) Promote lower Kinabatangan to niche ecotourism market at domestic and international level for the benefit of economics and conservation values

What we need:
We need your help to raise US$34,000.00 to make this happen, although any amount of money donated is appreciated. 
We have already started to raise some to cover the startup including promotional and marketing materials but your contribution will go directly to the following that will create a huge impact not just to the area but the region:
#1. Three months preliminary survey and assessment of the 5.9 acres land headed by a wildlife biologist. It is essential to link local and scientific knowledge to promote sustainable tourism and the environment. Survey and assessment include forest inventory, wildlife assessment to identify type of wildlife accessing the area, identifying possible habitat restoration after classification and forest condition are identified. Amount: US$ 6,500.00
#2. Two field assistants from the local communities to assist with the three months assessment. Amount: US$ 3,500.00
#3. Field equipments for assessment and survey (include 3 compasses, 3 binoculars, 3 units of GPS). Amount: US$ 1,800.00
#4. Boat transportation with boatman and fuel for field survey and assessment. Amount: US$ 1,500.00
#5. Construction of an inland tower for long term wildlife monitoring (approximately 7 meters high, 4 feet by 8 feet, including manpower, transportation and materials). Amount: US$ 4,500.00
#6. Construction of a floating jetty for embarkation and disembarkation, and riverside observation of elephant crossing from the river and other wildlife (approximately about 8 meters by 6 meters, including manpower, transportation and materials). Amount: US$5,500.00
#7. Three camera traps inclusive of storage cards and batteries, to document wildlife presence, behaviours and other important data that may be of help for wildlife conservation of the area. Each camera will be placed in strategic areas. Amount: US$ 3,000.00
#8. A two day workshop to develop a set of guideline for responsible ecotourism activities and training for long term wildlife monitoring. Participants include the land owner and local communities who will also be our team of naturalist guides. Amount: US$ 1,600.00
#9. One local villager trained to collect data from camera traps and to do wildlife monitoring - 12 months wage. Amount: US$ 4,200.00
#10. Food source plot -  The preliminary planting of food source for wildlife such as Borneo Pygmy Elephants and Orang Utans would include banana trees, fig trees and other plants that are native to the area. This includes boat transportation, seedlings, and manpower. Amount: US$ 1,900.00

The Impact:
Support this campaign to protect not just the lower Kinabatangan floodplain, or Borneo, but our planet. Your contribution will make this happen! Help the Borneo Pygmy Elephants, Orang Utans and other wildlife to safeguard their habitat. The success of this campaign will enable us to jumpstart all the tasks and activities required. We believe that this project has the potential to be replicated or applied locally and perhaps regionally and globally in areas that combine nature conservation and ecotourism.

<h2>About Us </h2>
<p>We met on the frisbee field fall of Sophomore year of college.  Liz likes to describe her first interactions with Erika like meeting a walking entertainment machine with big hair.  Erika has the ability to make anyone laugh and is always entertaining those around her with her energetic attitude.  Erika says she had a good feeling about their friendship when Liz laughed at all her weird jokes.  </p>
<p>After sometime we learned our similarities extended way beyond on our shared enjoyment for ultimate frisbee.  We both love to adventure including all things outdoors: camping, kayaking, canoeing, rock climbing, biking, skiing, and backpacking.  We both find great reward in teaching kids about the outdoors through experiental education.  We both love sporatic and spontaneous outings and have had our fair share of goodtimes as a result.  To top it off, we're both from Madison, Wisconsin.  </p>
<p>But what makes our friendship really special is we make a great team.  We've worked together guiding and organizing with several different groups.  People tell us we make an unstoppable pair.      </p>
<p>More about us...</p>
<p><strong>ERIKA </strong><span>grew up in Madison, WI where she could most often be found canoeing in a large puddle in her backyard or sailing on Lake Monona. She attended the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities earning a degree in Theatre Arts. During her undergraduate career, she spent her summers working at Camp Manito-wish YMCA, in Boulder Junction, WI; empowering participants between ages ten and eighteen with collaborative leadership skills through wilderness tripping. Erika has led trips for the Center for Outdoor Adventure through the University of Minnesota and with Wilderness Inquiry in Minneapolis. She enjoys figuring out new ways to infuse art and theatre into every experience she has in the outdoors. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>LIZ </strong><span>is a native Wisconsinite growing up just outside of Madison, WI.  She left home in 2008 to attend school at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities where she pursued a degree in Environmental Education and Sustainability Studies.  During college, her ongoing love for the outdoors merged with her studies during two off campus experiential education courses, fueling her current passions and interests.  The first, a domestic program in the Twin Cities, broaden Liz’s perspectives around different issues such as environmental justice, sustainable agriculture, and renewable energy.  The second experience took Liz halfway around the world to India where she spent six weeks hiking and camping in the Himalayas while studying culture, alpine ecosystems, mountain farming, and sustainability in a developing nation. These experiences lead her to a summer and fall guiding wilderness trips in the Midwest with Wilderness Inquiry.</span><span> </span></span></p>
<p><strong>This unstoppable pair is going to jump in a tandem canoe with eight others and paddle down America's largest river, The Mississippi. </strong> But we need your help to make it happen.  <strong>  </strong></p>
<h2>Why the Mississippi? </h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Growing up in Wisconsin and then moving nextdoor to Minnesota, the Mississippi has always held a special place in our hearts.  After college this connection deepend when we both spent time taking youth down a portion of the Mississippi in Minneapolis and St. Paul in voyager canoes with Wilderness Inquiry.  As many people know, it's easy to develop a realitionship with outdoor places.  We're both concerned that this important waterway isn't recieveing the attention it needs and is threatened by inevitable impacts of Climate Change.</p>
<p><span><span>As the climate debate comes to a head in the United States, it’s easy to get caught up in abstract political jargon and lose sight of the everyday people whose lives revolve around the health of a natural resource. We love paddling rivers that encompass an array of social and environmental issues because they tell a great story. One that needs to be heard.</span></span></p>
<p><span>In the fall of 2013, we, along with eight other people, will embark on and film a three month long canoe journey down the Mississippi River from the headwaters in Lake Itasca, Minnesota, to New Orleans. As we paddle, we will engage communities in an ongoing dialogue about their relationships to and interactions with this watertrail to give voice to the Mississippi River, its inhabitants, and the many perspectives we encounter along the way. Upon completion of the trip, we will produce a documentary of this journey so that these vital conversations can continue with others beyond the flow of the river.</span></p>

</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1098467/files/20141215140242-coversmall.jpg?1418680962"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The Whaler Watching Programme is a citizen-led campaign to document and expose the full truth about commercial whaling in Iceland. The idea for Whaler Watching was born in 2014 when during a vacation in Iceland we were appalled to learn about the existence of Iceland's commercial whale hunt. We hold the belief, shared by the overwhelming number of individuals and governments worldwide, that the slaughter of these majestic animals for commercial purposes is unconscionable. We believe the notion of ""humane whaling"" is a myth created and perpetuated by those who have a vested economic interest in the continuation of this gruesome practice.<br/><br/>
<p>The Whaler Watching Programme will offer an independent source
of information about the hunt of nature's most massive mammals. By
gathering comprehensive, first-hand information about the brutal killing of Iceland's most majestic marine mammals and sharing this information with the Icelandic
public, we hope to persuade more people to end their silent acquiescence of this controversial hunt and to join forces with those who oppose the hunt on ethical and ecological grounds.

<br/><h2 align=""center"">
<b>Why </b>Whaler Watching<b> is urgently needed </b>
</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Since
Iceland resumed its commercial whaling programme in 2006, <b>over  550</b> <a href=""http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/2478/0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">endangered fin whales</a> and <b>over
400 northern minke whales </b>have
been killed by Icelandic whalers. Whaling activities are conducted
far offshore where they are largely shielded from public scrutiny.
Due to the absence of independent whaling operation monitors, the
whaling industry presently enjoys a monopoly both on the
gathering of information about its own operations and the
dissemination of this information to the public. As a result of this,
the public perception of whaling in Iceland is to a great degree
shaped by the information that the whaling industry itself provides.
<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>According
to a<a href=""http://grapevine.is/culture/music/2014/04/08/most-icelanders-want-humane-whaling/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> 2013
poll</a>, 73 percent of Icelanders hold the view that it is
important that whaling operations are conducted in a humane manner,
indicating that the overwhelming majority of Icelanders are concerned
about the welfare of whales. In the same poll almost 60 percent of
Icelanders expressed the belief that Iceland’s whale hunt is
carried out in a humane manner. The widespread nature of this belief
stands in stark contrast to the fact that the whaling industry has so
far refused to make important data about the supposed humaneness of
the whale hunt available to the <a href=""http://grapevine.is/news/2014/07/03/how-long-it-takes-a-whale-to-die-kept-secret/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">public</a>.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>One

</div></div>","What is Whaler Watching ?


The Whaler Watching Programme is a citizen-led campaign to document and expose the full truth about commercial whaling in Iceland. The idea for Whaler Watching was born in 2014 when during a vacation in Iceland we were appalled to learn about the existence of Iceland's commercial whale hunt. We hold the belief, shared by the overwhelming number of individuals and governments worldwide, that the slaughter of these majestic animals for commercial purposes is unconscionable. We believe the notion of ""humane whaling"" is a myth created and perpetuated by those who have a vested economic interest in the continuation of this gruesome practice.
The Whaler Watching Programme will offer an independent source
of information about the hunt of nature's most massive mammals. By
gathering comprehensive, first-hand information about the brutal killing of Iceland's most majestic marine mammals and sharing this information with the Icelandic
public, we hope to persuade more people to end their silent acquiescence of this controversial hunt and to join forces with those who oppose the hunt on ethical and ecological grounds.




Why Whaler Watching is urgently needed 




Since
Iceland resumed its commercial whaling programme in 2006, over  550 endangered fin whales and over
400 northern minke whales have
been killed by Icelandic whalers. Whaling activities are conducted
far offshore where they are largely shielded from public scrutiny.
Due to the absence of independent whaling operation monitors, the
whaling industry presently enjoys a monopoly both on the
gathering of information about its own operations and the
dissemination of this information to the public. As a result of this,
the public perception of whaling in Iceland is to a great degree
shaped by the information that the whaling industry itself provides.



According
to a 2013
poll, 73 percent of Icelanders hold the view that it is
important that whaling operations are conducted in a humane manner,
indicating that the overwhelming majority of Icelanders are concerned
about the welfare of whales. In the same poll almost 60 percent of
Icelanders expressed the belief that Iceland’s whale hunt is
carried out in a humane manner. The widespread nature of this belief
stands in stark contrast to the fact that the whaling industry has so
far refused to make important data about the supposed humaneness of
the whale hunt available to the public.




One
has to wonder whether the perception that the whale hunt is conducted
humanely is based on facts or whether this impression is the result
of the marketing efforts combined with a very selective information
policy of the industry that has a vested economic interested
in maintaining the appearance of being humane. 








This is where the Whaler Watching Programme wants to come into play.




How we work 




We document

The
idea for the Whaler Watching Programme was born from the realization
that most people know very little about the brutal reality of
commercial whaling. The Whaler
Watching campaign has a strong visual media focus. Our
citizen-led initiative will use the power of the camera to document
whaling activities on- and offshore as comprehensively as possible.
The Whaler Watching team will trace and supervise whaling operations
and will gather visual footage that will subsequently be made
available to the public.
The primary purpose of our campaign is educational. All our operations will be conducted in a strictly non-confrontational manner. This means that we will not interfere with any whaling
activities, which are legal under Icelandic law. Instead we will use all
available legal means to document and expose the highly controversial
hunt.





We inform


Most
of the information about whaling practices, including
the information that is directly pertinent to the all-important
question whether or not the hunt is conducted humanely, is strictly controlled by the parties who have an economic interest
in the continuation of the hunt: namely the whaling and fishing
industry and their official counterparts in the Icelandic
government.
The
public's access to detailed and sensitive information is
intentionally restricted, which undermines any possibility of a
critical public debate about the ethical defensibility of whaling in
Iceland. 
The
Whaler Watching campaign will use all gathered data for public
information purposes. Our intention is to provide information that is
in the interest of everyone.




 Wildlife experts and ex-whalers speak out against the practice of whaling

Conservationists,
nature enthusiasts, and animal welfare advocates have long spoken out
against commercial whaling. In recent years even people who have been
personally involved in whaling activities have gone public with their
personal accounts of the brutal reality of whaling. These accounts paint a
picture that differs significantly from the account that the
Icelandic whaling industry likes to spread. Among those who have
witnessed whaling activities on the high seas, there exists hardly
any doubt that killing these sentient animals at sea is a horrific
and morally deeply troubling event. Contrary to what is often claimed
by pro-whaling parties, animals that are struck by harpoons rarely
die instantly.

<p><b>Please help us put their boots on the ground!</b></p></div>","Imagine the High Sierra Nevada of California - expansive
views, granite peaks, spectacular clear lakes, rushing streams, and fresh cool
air.  These things and the places they
represent stand tall in all our hearts and dreams. The US Forest Service keeps
them pristine and cared for, and they need your help.
Friends of the Inyo is a Bishop, CA based conservation non-profit dedicated to the preservation, exploration, and stewardship of public lands in California's Eastern Sierra. We work closely with the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to make sure this spectacular region gets the love and care it deserves and needs. We are working hard to raise funds to sponsor a
full time Wilderness Ranger Intern on the Sierra National
Forest this summer. This position will be based out of the Eastern Sierra and work in areas of the John Muir Wilderness most easily accessed from the
east side of the mountain crest. 
In a time of declining federal budgets, wilderness
management resources are becoming strained and harder to come by.
Simultaneously, more and more Americans seek solace and adventure in the wilderness every year. With this continuous increase in wilderness and backcountry
use, Wilderness Rangers Interns help ensure the health of
America’s public lands. This is a life changing opportunity. Working as a Wilderness Ranger Intern is a gateway to a career in land management and conservation. The intern will leave their time in the backcountry with an increased love of the wilderness and public lands and valuable skills to prepare them for future employment. The experience gained will help shape their lives in many ways, cultivating self reliance, increasing  conservation ethics, and building a foundation for the future!Help us make their dream a reality!As a routine part of their job the Wilderness Intern will:

Perform basic trail maintenance, keeping trails
open, clean, and passible.
Clean and maintain campsites so all visitors can
enjoy their experience.
Help visitors and hikers find their way by
maintaining trail signs and providing critical advice and a friendly face in
the backcountry.
Coordinate volunteer events and help volunteers get involved on their public lands.
Provide interpretive information, historical
context, and interesting information to visitors.
Gather essential data to help inform management
decisions.
Organize and coordinate wilderness restoration
projects.
Act as a critical voice on the ground for agencies
managing wilderness areas.

Please help us reach our goal of $5,000!
Your contribution will help fund:

A full season, paid internship for a Wilderness Ranger Intern
including job training and field experience to those interested in a career in
public lands management.

               Comprehensive training including:                         o 
Leave No Trace skills                         o 
Cross Cut Saw and minimum/traditional tool use                         o 
Campsite inventory and rehabilitation                         o 
Public contact and interaction                         o 
CPR and First Aid certification                         o 
GPS use and data collection methods                         o

Part of the funds raised will also be used to facilitate a week long backcountry volunteer stewardship trip. This project will pair volunteers with professional wilderness staff, including the Wilderness Ranger Intern, for a full wilderness work experience.
Volunteers will be packed into the Fourth Recess area in the John Muir Wilderness by mules.
Volunteers will be supported by and work with professional wilderness staff.
Volunteers will experience what it is like to live and work in the backcountry.

<h3>The Vitruvian Man Project</h3>
<p><strong>The Vitruvian Man Project</strong> is about finding hill tops and high places all over the planet and placing vertical wind turbines that are only <strong>ten feet tall</strong> and <strong>nine feet square on a mosaic tile pad</strong>. </p>
<p>There are millions of hilltops around the globe where the wind blows night and day. And yet, there exist nothing to catch, harness and put that free energy to use.</p>
<p>Here, in Bodega Bay, our home, where <strong>Alred Hitchcock</strong> made <em><strong>The Birds</strong></em>, <strong>1963</strong> is where we want to place our first vertical wind turbine and a thousand more just like it on a 30 acre parcel of land. Our idea is simple. Our concept is sound. Our passion creates a crescendo of possibilities that take us back to Leanardo di Vinci and The Vitruvian Man. </p>
<p><strong>Here is our concept:</strong> </p>
<p>Place 1000 turbines on mosaic art tile pads in the linear configuration of The Vitruvian Man. It will produce 5,000,000 watts of free sustainable enery which can be seen from satellites orbiting 24 hours a day,  and air travel passenges from San Francisco International Airport and Oakland International airport and many others. The grid of wind turbines will be plugged into Pacific Gas &amp; Electric  (PG&amp;E) and they wll pay the local villagers for their energy. </p>
<p><strong>Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey</strong> has been presented with this idea by visionary filmmaker, Robbin Michael Wagner and Brooke Laurel Denman and myself, Jessica Barry, Actress and Producer. <strong><em>Congresswoman Woolsey loves it!</em> <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) loves it!</em></strong> However Congresswoman Woolsey's advice and PG&amp;E's advice is to get this project into the grass roots mainstream.

<p> </p>
<p>This year I learnt about an incredible opportunity to travel to Antarctica to experience the last great wilderness on earth and to learn how climate change is affecting it. I applied and was accepted as one of thirty young people from around the world into the 2013 Antarctica Youth Ambassadors Program (AYAP) with Robert Swan and his company 2041.</p>
<p>Antarctica is the last great-untouched wilderness on earth, and I cannot wait to go and experience it for myself. Yet Antarctica is currently facing some of the worst effects of climate change, and by attending this expedition I am going to learn the skills to be able to bring back my knowledge and share it with my community. </p>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Morgan Pettersson and I am a 22-year-old environmental journalist from Perth, Western Australia. I graduated from Murdoch University in March this year with a Bachelors degree majoring in Journalism and Public Relations and a Bachelor of Arts majoring in History.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2011 I was awarded the Global Environment Journalism Initiative scholarship to study environmental journalism in Thessaloniki, Greece for one semester. Whilst there I learnt more about climate change and the current threat that the world economic crisis was having the worlds environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I care deeply about the environment and volunteer my time in my home town with the Australian Youth Climate Coalition as State Media Coordinator to try and communicate more effectively about the environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a journalist I know that communicating to people about the environment can be hard, as you need to tell an engaging story that wills people to want to keep reading, and I think that going to Antarctica and seeing climate change and environmental damage on the front line will help me to become a better communicator.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Expedition:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Polar explorer, environmental leader and public speaker <a href=""http://2041.com//about-2041/robert-swan/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Robert Swan, OBE</a>, the first person in history to walk to both the North and South poles founded 2041.</p>
<p>Swan has dedicated his life to the preservation of Antarctica by the promotion of recycling, renewable energy and sustainability to combat the effects of climate change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each year since 2003 Swan has lead expeditions down to Antarctica, taking with him an international team of young people, teachers, scientists, environmentalists and corporate leaders as part of his ‘Leadership on the Edge’ program and this year the expedition will run from February 28-March 13.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the year 2041 the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the <a href=""http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/geopolitical/treaty/update_1991.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""View Antarctic Treaty page"">Antarctic Treaty</a> could potentially be modified or amended. This treaty currently forbids mining and drilling in the Antarctic, but come 2041 this could all change and Antarctica and the waters surrounding the continent may no longer be protected.</p>
<p>Robert Swan and 2041’s aim is to work towards the continuing protection of the Antarctic Treaty so that the last great wilderness on earth is never exploited through education and implementation of renewable energy.</p>
<p><strong>Post Antarctica:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As part of my application to attend the expedition, I had to create a project that I would implement that would help to further spread the word on renewable energy and the threat facing Antarctica when I returned from the expedition.</p>
<p>As a writer and communicator I am passionate about communicating about the environment in effective and engaging ways.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My project that I am committing to post the expedition is to communicate about Antarctica and renewable energy projects around the world. You see all around the world there are young people, such as those attending the 2013 AYAP, who are creating change in their communities about the way others see climate change. For example there was a past participant from China who engineered a waterless toilet for a remote village in Ghana and a young Swedish girl helping to put solar cookers on the roofs of the favelas in Brazil.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These stories of young people making a difference are what I am going to travel and write about, including the great stories that are here in our local communities in Australia.</p>
<p>I am going to publish these stories to get the word out about young people making positive change in their local communities, and also film these stories and make them into a documentary.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The environment belongs to everyone, but this is especially true for Antarctica.</p>
<p>Antarctica has no claim on it by any country or indigenous people.</p>
<p>Antarctica belongs to all of us, and therefore it is all of our jobs to protect it.</p>
<p>If we don’t work to protect Antarctica then we are going to be faced with a monumental crisis.</p>
<p>If Antarctica holds 70% of the worlds fresh water, and if this melts……well lets not think about it.</p>
<p>In 2041 the Antarctic Treaty is going to expire, and if it is not renewed 100% then Antarctica might become open to mining and drilling by companies looking to exploit the natural reserves.</p>
<p>This might lead to the catastrophe that we are currently seeing in the Arctic currently.</p>
<p>We need to make sure that renewable energy is so common, that by the year 2041, no one wants to go to Antarctica and spoil the pristine wilderness by mining.</p>
<h3>Why you should sponsor me?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Everyone wants to help the environment, but not everyone can actually go to Antarctica to do so.</p>
<p>Well I want to act as an ambassador for my community to go and learn the knowledge and skills that I will acquire and bring them back so that everyone can benefit.</p>
<p>Through my project and writing I will be able to pass on everything I have learnt to even more people outside of my local community, so that everyone has a chance to learn and feel inspired from my journey.</p>
<p>I think as young people we are really powerful to create change because we are passionate and believe that anything is possible.</p>
<p>So if you too believe that this expedition is possible, and that this is an incredible opportunity, be sure to help me reach it!</p>
<h3>How you can help:</h3>

<p> </p></div>","What is this?
 
This year I learnt about an incredible opportunity to travel to Antarctica to experience the last great wilderness on earth and to learn how climate change is affecting it. I applied and was accepted as one of thirty young people from around the world into the 2013 Antarctica Youth Ambassadors Program (AYAP) with Robert Swan and his company 2041.
Antarctica is the last great-untouched wilderness on earth, and I cannot wait to go and experience it for myself. Yet Antarctica is currently facing some of the worst effects of climate change, and by attending this expedition I am going to learn the skills to be able to bring back my knowledge and share it with my community. 
Who am I?
 
My name is Morgan Pettersson and I am a 22-year-old environmental journalist from Perth, Western Australia. I graduated from Murdoch University in March this year with a Bachelors degree majoring in Journalism and Public Relations and a Bachelor of Arts majoring in History.
 
In 2011 I was awarded the Global Environment Journalism Initiative scholarship to study environmental journalism in Thessaloniki, Greece for one semester. Whilst there I learnt more about climate change and the current threat that the world economic crisis was having the worlds environment.
 
I care deeply about the environment and volunteer my time in my home town with the Australian Youth Climate Coalition as State Media Coordinator to try and communicate more effectively about the environment.
 
As a journalist I know that communicating to people about the environment can be hard, as you need to tell an engaging story that wills people to want to keep reading, and I think that going to Antarctica and seeing climate change and environmental damage on the front line will help me to become a better communicator.
 
The Expedition:
 
Polar explorer, environmental leader and public speaker Robert Swan, OBE, the first person in history to walk to both the North and South poles founded 2041.
Swan has dedicated his life to the preservation of Antarctica by the promotion of recycling, renewable energy and sustainability to combat the effects of climate change.
 
Each year since 2003 Swan has lead expeditions down to Antarctica, taking with him an international team of young people, teachers, scientists, environmentalists and corporate leaders as part of his ‘Leadership on the Edge’ program and this year the expedition will run from February 28-March 13.
 
In the year 2041 the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty could potentially be modified or amended. This treaty currently forbids mining and drilling in the Antarctic, but come 2041 this could all change and Antarctica and the waters surrounding the continent may no longer be protected.
Robert Swan and 2041’s aim is to work towards the continuing protection of the Antarctic Treaty so that the last great wilderness on earth is never exploited through education and implementation of renewable energy.
Post Antarctica:
 
As part of my application to attend the expedition, I had to create a project that I would implement that would help to further spread the word on renewable energy and the threat facing Antarctica when I returned from the expedition.
As a writer and communicator I am passionate about communicating about the environment in effective and engaging ways.
 
My project that I am committing to post the expedition is to communicate about Antarctica and renewable energy projects around the world. You see all around the world there are young people, such as those attending the 2013 AYAP, who are creating change in their communities about the way others see climate change. For example there was a past participant from China who engineered a waterless toilet for a remote village in Ghana and a young Swedish girl helping to put solar cookers on the roofs of the favelas in Brazil.
 
These stories of young people making a difference are what I am going to travel and write about, including the great stories that are here in our local communities in Australia.
I am going to publish these stories to get the word out about young people making positive change in their local communities, and also film these stories and make them into a documentary.
 
The Impact
 
The environment belongs to everyone, but this is especially true for Antarctica.
Antarctica has no claim on it by any country or indigenous people.
Antarctica belongs to all of us, and therefore it is all of our jobs to protect it.
If we don’t work to protect Antarctica then we are going to be faced with a monumental crisis.
If Antarctica holds 70% of the worlds fresh water, and if this melts……well lets not think about it.
In 2041 the Antarctic Treaty is going to expire, and if it is not renewed 100% then Antarctica might become open to mining and drilling by companies looking to exploit the natural reserves.
This might lead to the catastrophe that we are currently seeing in the Arctic currently.
We need to make sure that renewable energy is so common, that by the year 2041, no one wants to go to Antarctica and spoil the pristine wilderness by mining.
Why you should sponsor me?
 
Everyone wants to help the environment, but not everyone can actually go to Antarctica to do so.
Well I want to act as an ambassador for my community to go and learn the knowledge and skills that I will acquire and bring them back so that everyone can benefit.
Through my project and writing I will be able to pass on everything I have learnt to even more people outside of my local community, so that everyone has a chance to learn and feel inspired from my journey.
I think as young people we are really powerful to create change because we are passionate and believe that anything is possible.
So if you too believe that this expedition is possible, and that this is an incredible opportunity, be sure to help me reach it!
How you can help:
 
Getting to Antarctica is quite expensive as you can imagine, and I need all of the help that I can get to make my dream come true.
The total cost of the expedition is $20,000.00!
BUT If you are able to help me raise ¼ of my goal, $5,000.00, then I will be able to secure my place on the trip 100%.
I am hoping to get help from sponsors to fund the remaining part of the expedition costs.
There are great incentives to donate to my campaign, so I hope you do and are able to come along on this journey with me!

Well, bamboo has a rhizomatic root structure that literally grows across the

<p><b>I

</h3><p></p><p><span>We are the Georgia Tech International Genetic Engineering Machine (iGEM) team competing in the 2014 iGEM International Jamboree, this October/November. iGEM is a synthetic biology competition where teams try to give an organism an ability that it didn’t have before which benefits both the community and the world. The competition features teams from colleges around the world and we collaborate with these groups to help each other accomplish our goals. Our team is composed of young and experienced students, passionate and ready to take on a project like this. <br/></span></p><p><span>Our project this year is to give <i>E. coli</i> the ability to convert methane into methanol. Methane contamination of water is a big issue in areas where fracking activity occurs. The US Geologic Survey suggests that greater than 10 ppm of methane in water is harmful; however, greater than 50 ppm have been seen in some areas, including places in Texas and Pennsylvania. We are looking to reduce the problem of methane contamination in an effective manner to better the environment and improve the health of residents near areas where fracking exists. Your help would clean the drinking water of fracking-affected people and in conjunction with EPA could clean our air of methane and reduce greenhouse gases. <br/></span></p><p><span>Your contributions will be used to fund our research and reach out to those who are affected by and those who are tired of the ever-changing weather. Right now, water treatment methods, such as aeration, are ineffective in removing the methane from the water. Also, these methods do not remove all the methane and can end up releasing the methane into the air. According to the EPA, “pound for pound, the comparative impact of methane on climate change is over 20 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period.” Your help will put us one step closer to our goal: to help these people live better lives in better conditions. This is not end-all-be-all solution for these people but your support can go a long way.</span></p><p>Additionally, the Georgia Tech iGEM team won gold for the 2013 iGEM competition last year, and we look forward to achieving the same honor this year. </p><h3><span>What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3><p>Your contributions will go towards travel expenses to attend the iGEM Giant Jamboree competition in Boston, Massachusetts from October 30-November 3. As of now, we have only have enough funding to bring a few of our members; however, we'd love for all of our members to experience this amazing opportunity. Below is the estimated cost of the entire trip. <br/></p><p><b>Estimated Costs:</b></p><p>Team registration fee:  $3,500</p><p>Attendance fee:  $750/person (8 people)<br/></p><p>Flight:  $350/person (8 people) <br/></p><p>Hotel: $200/night (4 nights, 2 rooms)<br/></p><p>Seeing our research make a difference: Priceless</p><p>TOTAL COST: $13,900</p><p>Yikes! That's a lot of money, but luckily, team registration is paid for and the cost of food and activities will be incurred on our members. <br/></p><p>To acknowledge your donations, any donator of and above $250 towards our project, will be given an iGEM T-shirt with our team logo on the front and your name on the back of the T-shirt listing you as a sponsor for our project. We will also wear these T-shirts to the competition sponsoring your company in front of hundreds of people from all over the world. It’s a good platform for advertising</p><p></p><h3>Stretch Goals</h3><p>In addition to reaching the $2,000 goal, we'd love to accomplish a few more things with the extra money. <br/></p><p>Group dinner at the Jamboree:  $200</p><p>Allow another member to attend: $1,100</p><p>Lab materials: $800</p><p>Boston American History Tour: $320 ($40/person)<br/></p><p>Any other additional funds will be saved for our future iGEM team! <br/></p><h3><span>The Impact</span></h3><p>The success of this project would allow us to have a new system of removing methane from water using bacteria.

We are the Georgia Tech International Genetic Engineering Machine (iGEM) team competing in the 2014 iGEM International Jamboree, this October/November. iGEM is a synthetic biology competition where teams try to give an organism an ability that it didn’t have before which benefits both the community and the world. The competition features teams from colleges around the world and we collaborate with these groups to help each other accomplish our goals. Our team is composed of young and experienced students, passionate and ready to take on a project like this. Our project this year is to give E. coli the ability to convert methane into methanol. Methane contamination of water is a big issue in areas where fracking activity occurs. The US Geologic Survey suggests that greater than 10 ppm of methane in water is harmful; however, greater than 50 ppm have been seen in some areas, including places in Texas and Pennsylvania. We are looking to reduce the problem of methane contamination in an effective manner to better the environment and improve the health of residents near areas where fracking exists. Your help would clean the drinking water of fracking-affected people and in conjunction with EPA could clean our air of methane and reduce greenhouse gases. Your contributions will be used to fund our research and reach out to those who are affected by and those who are tired of the ever-changing weather. Right now, water treatment methods, such as aeration, are ineffective in removing the methane from the water. Also, these methods do not remove all the methane and can end up releasing the methane into the air. According to the EPA, “pound for pound, the comparative impact of methane on climate change is over 20 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period.” Your help will put us one step closer to our goal: to help these people live better lives in better conditions. This is not end-all-be-all solution for these people but your support can go a long way.Additionally, the Georgia Tech iGEM team won gold for the 2013 iGEM competition last year, and we look forward to achieving the same honor this year. What We Need & What You GetYour contributions will go towards travel expenses to attend the iGEM Giant Jamboree competition in Boston, Massachusetts from October 30-November 3. As of now, we have only have enough funding to bring a few of our members; however, we'd love for all of our members to experience this amazing opportunity. Below is the estimated cost of the entire trip. Estimated Costs:Team registration fee:  $3,500Attendance fee:  $750/person (8 people)Flight:  $350/person (8 people) Hotel: $200/night (4 nights, 2 rooms)Seeing our research make a difference: PricelessTOTAL COST: $13,900Yikes! That's a lot of money, but luckily, team registration is paid for and the cost of food and activities will be incurred on our members. To acknowledge your donations, any donator of and above $250 towards our project, will be given an iGEM T-shirt with our team logo on the front and your name on the back of the T-shirt listing you as a sponsor for our project. We will also wear these T-shirts to the competition sponsoring your company in front of hundreds of people from all over the world. It’s a good platform for advertisingStretch GoalsIn addition to reaching the $2,000 goal, we'd love to accomplish a few more things with the extra money. Group dinner at the Jamboree:  $200Allow another member to attend: $1,100Lab materials: $800Boston American History Tour: $320 ($40/person)Any other additional funds will be saved for our future iGEM team! The ImpactThe success of this project would allow us to have a new system of removing methane from water using bacteria. The EPA could produce the bacteria in appreciable amounts and release it in the soil in areas where methane contamination is a problem. This project could not only improve the lives of people directly affected by methane contamination in water but also help to reduce the worldwide problem of global warming. Your assistance could get us one step closer towards our goals. Risks & ChallengesAll great projects come with their challenges but we are prepared for every obstacle.

My name is Alexander Semenov, I'm a marine biologist and a professional <a href=""http://clione.ru/gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">underwater photographer</a> and also I'm a head of the scientific divers team at the <a href=""http://en.wsbs-msu.ru/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">White Sea Biological Station</a> of Lomonosov's Moscow State University, Russia. Our station was founded in 1938 and mostly it was built by enthusiasts who came here because of the amazing atmosphere that had being developed over many years at the station. This is an unusual and unique mix of students energy, serious science and the harsh northern nature.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8430/7814413220_dedb46a62e_o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Over the summer season, the station has more than 600 visitors: students, PhDs, scientists from different countries and volunteers, and they all leave the station happy looking forward to come back again and again. Theese people were gathered into volunteer construction teams and came to the station every year, reaching out electricity, building materials and with their own hands were building biological station from scratch. Now it is a modern scientific village at the Kindo peninsula on the border of the Arctic Circle. It's isolated settlement with no road - it is possible to get there only by boat or snowmobile in winter when the sea is covered with ice.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://clione.ru/wp-content/gallery/land/land-37.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And all we have is almost excellent: students have their field practice, scientists investigate the sea, we dive and pick all what is necessary for scientific work from under water. But there is one little problem - it is our diving shed, where we spend most of the time, because all our equipment, tanks, air compressor are kept there. There we are changing clothes, discussing plans and preparing to dive, but the trouble is that this building - a tiny and very old barn, fourth rooted into the ground, and it is at the edge of being collapsed.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7108/7814469714_d43740b0b9_o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In recent years, as the imortance of scientific diving raised, necessity of diving operations increased greatly. Earlier at the station there were just a few divers who dived two or three times a week, now there is a entire team making 2-3 dives every day during 4-5 months. There is not enough space for all of us anymore.</p>

<p>As soon as I was appointed to lead a team of divers, I immediately began to look for an opportunity to demolish this shed, until the roof falls on divers or until they are not harmed by some huge nail, with which the barn is stitched - probably, this is the only reason why it's still stays still. After a long search and talking with various people, it became clear that in Russia funding the construction by the university - it is a sort of science fiction, and the only way to construct a building at the biological station is to find some private funds or to buy building materials and pay workers by yourself.</p>

<p>We found money for building materials, part of the funds raised with the help of staff and friends of the biological station, but this is not enough - the cost of materials, especially the cost of delivery of the materials to the station isolated from civilization turned out to be prohibitively high. At the moment we bought most of the lumber and laid it out to dry until the fall comes, we also paid for and received the architectural project and all calculations. Then our money ran out, and to buy all other materials we need 18 thousand dollars more, excluding shipping, shipping costs will increase it by another $2000. Doors, windows, insulation, wind and moisture protection material for the roof, paint and impregnation of wood, cement for the basement, as well as all necessary things like nails and screws - all this we need to buy as soon as funds become available.</p>
<p>We planned to start construction this fall, in mid-September it is the end of the field season and the weather still allows you to build something. We will have time to finish till November, because in November there comes the Polar Night that lasts six months and snow falls. If we raise money to planned time, we will succeed, and in March/April next year we will be able to start our dives in icy cold waters, working in brand new divers house, and heated with a mug of hot tea after hours in the White Sea.</p>

<p>If we fail gathering the whole amount, then we will buy basic materials - cement and profiled sheeting for the roof, which will allow us to build the basement and walls of timber, which is alredy purchased, and place it under a roof.

<p>Hi Everyone! </p>
<p>I'm really excited to be on the homestretch of this book. It's been an odyssey and I've learned tons in the process; things that I'm very eager to share. I strongly believe that this book brings together in a new form, many of the ideas and inspirations that have motivated us in the ecology movement over the past few decades. Most importantly, the book isn't an abstract set of ideas, but rather a ""cookbook"" for practicing the key ingredients of a lasting culture.</p>
<p><em>""Pfeiffer’s “Wild Earth, Wild Soul” is a recipe for realizing our greatest longing: to live in a culture rooted in the Earth where each of us is treated with love and respect. Filled with indigenous wisdom; this rich, practical offering provides a way for small groups to experience that now as well as hope for the well being of future generations.""  - Thom Hartmann</em></p>
<p>All of the funds we're hoping to raise here will go toward paying editors, proofreaders and creating a website. After almost three years, and countless hours of helpful conversations with friends and colleagues, now it's time to get it to the publisher. Every contribution, no matter how small, is key to the project's success.

</div></div>","Hi Everyone! 
I'm really excited to be on the homestretch of this book. It's been an odyssey and I've learned tons in the process; things that I'm very eager to share. I strongly believe that this book brings together in a new form, many of the ideas and inspirations that have motivated us in the ecology movement over the past few decades. Most importantly, the book isn't an abstract set of ideas, but rather a ""cookbook"" for practicing the key ingredients of a lasting culture.
""Pfeiffer’s “Wild Earth, Wild Soul” is a recipe for realizing our greatest longing: to live in a culture rooted in the Earth where each of us is treated with love and respect. Filled with indigenous wisdom; this rich, practical offering provides a way for small groups to experience that now as well as hope for the well being of future generations.""  - Thom Hartmann
All of the funds we're hoping to raise here will go toward paying editors, proofreaders and creating a website. After almost three years, and countless hours of helpful conversations with friends and colleagues, now it's time to get it to the publisher. Every contribution, no matter how small, is key to the project's success. This is about more than the book, it's about creating healthy communities, based on the successes of cultures that have come before, with new tools for healing and transformation.

<h1>LE PROJET</h1>
<div>
<h4></h4>
<p><b>Le projet est de créer et de diffuser des émissions TV environnementales ludiques, pédagogiques et interactives pour protéger et valoriser la planète tout en sensibilisant un large public. Comment ?<br/></b></p>
<b>
</b><ol>
<b>
</b><li>
<b>En mobilisant les différents acteurs environnementaux (scientifiques, élus, entreprises, ONG, associations, célébrités, particuliers et familles) autour d'actions écologiques concrètes réalisées sur site main dans la main.<br/></b>
</li>
<b>
</b><li><b>Et, en diffusant en direct sur le web ces émissions sous forme de mission depuis une plateforme océanique itinérante et autonome.</b></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<h3><b>Une Social TV environnementale !</b></h3>
<p>Nous voulons créer la 1ère Social TV environnementale ! Ici, le spectateur devient ACTEUR. Vous pourrez agir pour la planète avec les invités du bord depuis chez vous, à travers les interactions web que nous mettrons en place, ou directement, en montant à bord de La OHANA. Les programmes TV que nous proposerons mêleront Action, Découverte, Aventure et nouvelles technologies d'immersion totale. Avec La OHANA, vous plongerez au cœur des ""émissions-missions"" !<br/></p>
<h3>Pourquoi un tel projet ?</h3>
<p>Aujourd'hui, nous ne pouvons plus attendre. Les interdictions, les messages d'alerte, de risque, de danger, nous immobilisent plus qu'ils ne nous motivent. Pourtant, nous devons agir ! Le temps est à la mobilisation et à l'action. Alors que devons-nous faire ?<br/></p>
<blockquote><p>""La motivation nait du plaisir que nous prenons à faire les choses""</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<h3>La mission de La OHANA<br/>
</h3>
<p>Rassembler toutes les compétences et le savoir faire nécessaire pour montrer qu'il est possible de prendre du plaisir à valoriser et à protéger notre environnement et diffuser cette démarche le plus largement possible. <br/></p>
<h3><b>Un symbole d'UNION</b></h3>
<p>Pour rassembler, nous avons besoin d'un symbole d'union. Ce symbole, c'est le maxi trimaran La OHANA. Il sera construit dans le plus grand respect de l'environnement, propulsé de manière non polluante, accessible aux différents types de handicap et produira une partie de sa nourriture (notamment) grâce à sa serre hydroponique. Il pourra accueillir 30 personnes à son bord pour une immersion totale au cœur de la Nature.</p>
<p>Navire d'investigation du 21ème siècle, autonome et indépendant, La OHANA embarquera tout le matériel nécessaire à la réalisation de ses ""émissions-missions"":</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Un mini sous-marin capable de descendre à 1 000 mètres de profondeur,</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Un hydravion électrique pour observer en silence les animaux et intervenir rapidement sur site pour témoigner,</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Des drones et des capteurs pour récolter toutes les informations indispensables aux scientifiques pendant ses voyages sur les différents océans.</span></li>
</ul>
<div>
<h1>EN QUOI LA OHANA EST-IL UN PROJET PARTICULIER ?</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Issus de l’univers des logiciels libres et du monde alternatif, nous avons imaginé La OHANA <b>comme un média, une plate-forme libre d’accès,</b> au service des ONG, des fondations, des entreprises, des organisations locales souhaitant protéger ou valoriser l'environnement. Ainsi, nous voulons offrir un véritable navire d'exploration en marque blanche à tous ceux qui agissent pour le bien de la planète et UNIR toutes les actions qui vont dans le même sens. <br/></p>
<p>Avec ce projet, nous voulons également réunir toutes les énergies dans un univers vierge, propice à l'émergence d'idées, en rupture avec tout ce que nous connaissons, l'Océan. </p>
<p>L'esprit de famille est la clé de voute du projet car il permet de rassembler des personnes issues d’univers très différents, dans une quête ouverte aux solutions de Demain. Une famille où chacun y trouve sa place et un rôle à jouer.</p>
<h3><b>Une nouvelle vision de l'environnement<br/></b></h3>
<p>Au-delà de l'état sur la planète océan, des enquêtes que nous mènerons, des mauvaises pratiques que nous démasquerons, nous voulons donner une autre vision de la protection de la planète et de leurs habitants. Un regard avec notre ADN océanique : ouvert, fluide, dynamique, plein d’humour et d’amour !

</p>
<h3><b>Des défis à relever</b></h3>
<p><b>Être les premiers à proposer un concept mêlant TV, Environnement, Familles et Actions en direct  :</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Développer des programmes et des outils incontournables pour la connaissance et la protection de la vie dans une démarche ludique et interactive.</span></li>

<li><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Être un symbole d'Union et d’avenir pour l'humanité.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;""></span></h3>
<h3><b>Des contraintes</b></h3>
<b>Un projet de cette envergure, c'est aussi quelques contraintes : <br/></b><ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">La conception et la construction d'un multicoque de cette taille fait partie intégrante du projet. C’est l’occasion de voir de plus près comment nous arrivons aujourd’hui à construire un navire d’investigation avec la plus faible empreinte environnementale possible pour en faire un vaisseau océanique du futur tout en restant dans une budget cohérent.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Le développement d’un projet multimédia ambitieux et innovant sur le plan informatique et logistique.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Une telle entreprise est toujours une aventure humaine, qui mérite aussi d’être partagée à toutes les étapes.</span></li>
</ul>

<h1>A QUOI NOUS SERVIRA LE<br/>FINANCEMENT ?</h1>
<h3><b>A réaliser la saison pilote !</b></h3>
<p>Il s’agit de<b> montrer par l’exemple et l’image</b> ce que seront les programmes que nous pourrons réaliser avec La OHANA. Il est difficile d’imaginer un nouveau concept. Aussi, cette phase est cruciale. Elle doit permettre de <b>convaincre</b> (investisseurs financiers et diffuseurs en particulier) de la faisabilité et de l’intérêt de cette approche transversale, ludique et familiale de l’environnement.</p>
<p>Une saison pilote est un exemple au travers de quelques émissions types de ce que seront les programmes de la chaine TV La OHANA. Pour cette saison, nous avons prévu de décliner 2 à 3 épisodes <a href=""http://fr.la-ohana.org/category/programmes-tv/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">des différentes émissions</a> que nous souhaitons proposer.

<p><b>Pourquoi
ne pas le faire sur le trimaran actuel de la famille Bouche ? </b></p>
<p>En 2010, la famille Bouche a créé l’association
Globe2Child dont l’objectif principal était de relier les enfants, via les
écoles, sur une plateforme sociale de type wiki au travers d’un voyage en
famille en trimaran. Ce projet a été réalisé sur fonds propres sur leur bateau.
Au cours de ce voyage, ils ont pu prendre conscience de la difficulté de tout
gérer eux-mêmes, navigation, organisation des rencontres, tournages, montage et
diffusion avec gestion du site internet et du réseau en plus de la vie de
famille. </p>
<p><span>La OHANA regroupe
toutes les compétences techniques et professionnelles pour en assurer la
faisabilité et la réussite. Notamment
avec Yvan Bourgnon en tant que capitaine, Jacques Vapillon, René Heuzey er François
Sarano pour toute la partie vidéo, Charles Gagnon, Antoine Lambert, Emilie Ogez
pour toute la partie télévision et communication, Philippe Roulin pour la
partie architecture, OneStep MDA Sàrl et Suboceana pour la partie
interactivité, image 3D etc </span></p>
<p><span>Pour plus
d’informations : <a href=""http://fr.la-ohana.org/globe2child-la-ohana/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://fr.la-ohana.org/globe2child-la-ohana/</a></span></p>
<p><b>Pourquoi
joindre une famille avec des enfants à un tel projet <span>?</span></b></p>
<p><span>Le maxi trimaran
aura un équipage professionnel et servira à des associations et fondations en
marque blanche. Toute personne qui fait de la voile comprend qu'emmener 30
personnes sur un bateau ce n'est pas des vacances. La famille fondatrice ayant
vécu sur leur bateau plusieurs années, ils sont les plus disposés à animer les
émissions mettant à contribution les familles invitées à bord ainsi que les
scientifiques. Il ne s’agit pas de leur payer un bateau
puisqu’ils disposent du leur et qu’ils ne souhaitent pas s’en séparer. D’autre
part, l’animation d’émissions familiales par une famille authentique fait
partie du concept même de La OHANA.</span></p>
<p><span>Tout le projet de
La OHANA est de joindre 3 univers qui agissent séparément autour d’une même
action : les scientifiques qui analysent, les associations qui agissent et
les familles qui sont aujourd’hui plus considérées comme des spectateurs.</span></p>
<p><span>Nous voulons les
réunir pour joindre l’analyse à l’action et inclure la famille dans cette prise
de conscience. Elles seront les témoins et les ambassadrices qu’un changement
est possible. Que nous pouvons, si nous agissons tous à notre niveau, mettre en
place un autre Demain.</span></p>
<p><span>Les enfants nous
permettent aussi d’avoir un autre regard sur les différentes missions et
rencontres que nous feront. Ils sont l’avenir et nous devons les inclure au
plus vite dans toute la démarche environnementale. Ils sont spontanés et cela
sert le projet. Nous souhaitons inclure le plus possible les familles, c’est
pour cela que nous avons appelé le projet « OHANA », « FAMILLE »
en hawaïen. Le changement passera par nos enfants.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Ca veut dire quoi « mettre La OHANA à disposition en
marque blanche » ?</span></b></p>
<p><span>Aujourd’hui, des
associations et de grandes ONGs comme le WWF, Jane Goodall, Expédition 7<sup>ème</sup>
Continent souhaitent avoir accès à un bateau d’exploration, en utilisant leur
marquage et en ayant le droit de faire leur communication. Les navires comme
Tara, Ifremer, Sea Shepherd ou encore Greenpeace ne le permettent pas. La OHANA
le permettra. Ils pourront la louer avec l’équipage et le matériel pour mener
des actions, des expéditions sous leur marque et produire leur contenu sans
être tenu de « signer » La OHANA partout. Notre objectif est de
fournir cette plateforme à tous les acteurs afin qu’ils puissent mener des
actions concrètes et non, de faire connaître la OHANA pour La OHANA. Seul le
résultat compte.</span></p>

<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; color: #0eb4b6 !important;"">How was the Project Born?</h3>
<p>Since 2009,
we have crossed the oceans with our 4 children meeting people, learning about
their traditions and their cultures. We wanted to show our children that
another world exists, different from the one we see in the media. During our
stops, we met many people actively working for the good of the planet, on the
regional, local and even the micro-local levels. So many, many people that we
started asking ourselves, ""What would happen if…""</p>
<ul>
<li>
If we could share these local actions with a wider
     public?</li>
<li>If we could highlight these actions in entertaining TV shows, in the form of challenges?<br/>
</li>
<li>If we could host people, you, aboard a
     boat, to confront these challenges one by one?<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<ul>
</ul>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; color: #0eb4b6 !important;"">What is Special about this Project?</h3>
<p>Coming from
a business background of alternative and open-source computer programming, we
imagined a one-of-a-kind exploration vessel, equipped for media activities, a
platform free of access, at the service of large NGOs and foundations, but also
for local organizations and all initiatives wishing to mobilize a large public.
</p>
<p>Today, we need
to feature these people who live differently from us or who have an original
way of living their lives. Show their ground-level actions, and the men and
women who live up to the actions they are leading. </p>
<p>Bring back
hope and help people dream once more!</p>
<p>This is why we will film directly from the ocean on the maxi trimaran using
a ""reality show"" format, but one that will honestly be
""reality"" and of high quality. <br/></p>

<p><b></b></p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; color: #0eb4b6 !important;"">Launch the Movement...</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond showing the state of this ocean planet, doing
surveys and research and exposing bad practices, we want to create a movement
to unite the ""crew"" of planet Earth to build this world we all only
dream about now!</p>
<p>It is true
-- the source of all life on Earth is in great danger. What we know less about
is that it also possesses a great power of transformation. The ocean teaches us
to invent a new world, more ecological and communal, where everyone can find
his or her place and origins. </p>
<p>We want to
give another vision of the defense of this planet and its inhabitants. A point
of view from the oceanic DNA: wide-open, fluid, dynamic, full of humor and
love!</p>
<p>This is the
base concept of La OHANA, one single, human family to conduct communal actions
for the benefit of all.</p>

LE PROJET


Le projet est de créer et de diffuser des émissions TV environnementales ludiques, pédagogiques et interactives pour protéger et valoriser la planète tout en sensibilisant un large public. Comment ?




En mobilisant les différents acteurs environnementaux (scientifiques, élus, entreprises, ONG, associations, célébrités, particuliers et familles) autour d'actions écologiques concrètes réalisées sur site main dans la main.


Et, en diffusant en direct sur le web ces émissions sous forme de mission depuis une plateforme océanique itinérante et autonome.



Une Social TV environnementale !
Nous voulons créer la 1ère Social TV environnementale ! Ici, le spectateur devient ACTEUR. Vous pourrez agir pour la planète avec les invités du bord depuis chez vous, à travers les interactions web que nous mettrons en place, ou directement, en montant à bord de La OHANA. Les programmes TV que nous proposerons mêleront Action, Découverte, Aventure et nouvelles technologies d'immersion totale. Avec La OHANA, vous plongerez au cœur des ""émissions-missions"" !
Pourquoi un tel projet ?
Aujourd'hui, nous ne pouvons plus attendre. Les interdictions, les messages d'alerte, de risque, de danger, nous immobilisent plus qu'ils ne nous motivent. Pourtant, nous devons agir ! Le temps est à la mobilisation et à l'action. Alors que devons-nous faire ?
""La motivation nait du plaisir que nous prenons à faire les choses""

La mission de La OHANA

Rassembler toutes les compétences et le savoir faire nécessaire pour montrer qu'il est possible de prendre du plaisir à valoriser et à protéger notre environnement et diffuser cette démarche le plus largement possible. 
Un symbole d'UNION
Pour rassembler, nous avons besoin d'un symbole d'union. Ce symbole, c'est le maxi trimaran La OHANA. Il sera construit dans le plus grand respect de l'environnement, propulsé de manière non polluante, accessible aux différents types de handicap et produira une partie de sa nourriture (notamment) grâce à sa serre hydroponique. Il pourra accueillir 30 personnes à son bord pour une immersion totale au cœur de la Nature.
Navire d'investigation du 21ème siècle, autonome et indépendant, La OHANA embarquera tout le matériel nécessaire à la réalisation de ses ""émissions-missions"":



Un mini sous-marin capable de descendre à 1 000 mètres de profondeur,


Un hydravion électrique pour observer en silence les animaux et intervenir rapidement sur site pour témoigner,

Des drones et des capteurs pour récolter toutes les informations indispensables aux scientifiques pendant ses voyages sur les différents océans.


EN QUOI LA OHANA EST-IL UN PROJET PARTICULIER ?

Issus de l’univers des logiciels libres et du monde alternatif, nous avons imaginé La OHANA comme un média, une plate-forme libre d’accès, au service des ONG, des fondations, des entreprises, des organisations locales souhaitant protéger ou valoriser l'environnement. Ainsi, nous voulons offrir un véritable navire d'exploration en marque blanche à tous ceux qui agissent pour le bien de la planète et UNIR toutes les actions qui vont dans le même sens. 
Avec ce projet, nous voulons également réunir toutes les énergies dans un univers vierge, propice à l'émergence d'idées, en rupture avec tout ce que nous connaissons, l'Océan. 
L'esprit de famille est la clé de voute du projet car il permet de rassembler des personnes issues d’univers très différents, dans une quête ouverte aux solutions de Demain. Une famille où chacun y trouve sa place et un rôle à jouer.
Une nouvelle vision de l'environnement
Au-delà de l'état sur la planète océan, des enquêtes que nous mènerons, des mauvaises pratiques que nous démasquerons, nous voulons donner une autre vision de la protection de la planète et de leurs habitants. Un regard avec notre ADN océanique : ouvert, fluide, dynamique, plein d’humour et d’amour !


Des défis à relever
Être les premiers à proposer un concept mêlant TV, Environnement, Familles et Actions en direct  :


Développer des programmes et des outils incontournables pour la connaissance et la protection de la vie dans une démarche ludique et interactive.
Devenir un laboratoire vivant et un « hublot » depuis l’océan.
Devenir un acteur incontournable pour la protection de la planète.
Être un symbole d'Union et d’avenir pour l'humanité.


Des contraintes
Un projet de cette envergure, c'est aussi quelques contraintes : 
La conception et la construction d'un multicoque de cette taille fait partie intégrante du projet. C’est l’occasion de voir de plus près comment nous arrivons aujourd’hui à construire un navire d’investigation avec la plus faible empreinte environnementale possible pour en faire un vaisseau océanique du futur tout en restant dans une budget cohérent.
Le développement d’un projet multimédia ambitieux et innovant sur le plan informatique et logistique.
Une telle entreprise est toujours une aventure humaine, qui mérite aussi d’être partagée à toutes les étapes.




A QUOI NOUS SERVIRA LEFINANCEMENT ?
A réaliser la saison pilote !
Il s’agit de montrer par l’exemple et l’image ce que seront les programmes que nous pourrons réaliser avec La OHANA. Il est difficile d’imaginer un nouveau concept. Aussi, cette phase est cruciale. Elle doit permettre de convaincre (investisseurs financiers et diffuseurs en particulier) de la faisabilité et de l’intérêt de cette approche transversale, ludique et familiale de l’environnement.
Une saison pilote est un exemple au travers de quelques émissions types de ce que seront les programmes de la chaine TV La OHANA. Pour cette saison, nous avons prévu de décliner 2 à 3 épisodes des différentes émissions que nous souhaitons proposer. Notamment, Minut’Captain, 100% pur jus, Cap OHANA, Dreams’ Storming et Destination OHANA.
Les 50 000 euros nous serviront à la location du matériel vidéo professionnel, à l'organisation des rencontres, à la réalisation et à la production de ces émissions et à leur diffusion au travers de la chaine TV La OHANA.  


Le tournage se déroulera de fin février à fin juin 2015.

----FAQ




Pourquoi
ne pas le faire sur le trimaran actuel de la famille Bouche ? 
En 2010, la famille Bouche a créé l’association
Globe2Child dont l’objectif principal était de relier les enfants, via les
écoles, sur une plateforme sociale de type wiki au travers d’un voyage en
famille en trimaran. Ce projet a été réalisé sur fonds propres sur leur bateau.
Au cours de ce voyage, ils ont pu prendre conscience de la difficulté de tout
gérer eux-mêmes, navigation, organisation des rencontres, tournages, montage et
diffusion avec gestion du site internet et du réseau en plus de la vie de
famille. 
La OHANA regroupe
toutes les compétences techniques et professionnelles pour en assurer la
faisabilité et la réussite. Notamment
avec Yvan Bourgnon en tant que capitaine, Jacques Vapillon, René Heuzey er François
Sarano pour toute la partie vidéo, Charles Gagnon, Antoine Lambert, Emilie Ogez
pour toute la partie télévision et communication, Philippe Roulin pour la
partie architecture, OneStep MDA Sàrl et Suboceana pour la partie
interactivité, image 3D etc 
Pour plus
d’informations : http://fr.la-ohana.org/globe2child-la-ohana/
Pourquoi
joindre une famille avec des enfants à un tel projet ?
Le maxi trimaran
aura un équipage professionnel et servira à des associations et fondations en
marque blanche. Toute personne qui fait de la voile comprend qu'emmener 30
personnes sur un bateau ce n'est pas des vacances. La famille fondatrice ayant
vécu sur leur bateau plusieurs années, ils sont les plus disposés à animer les
émissions mettant à contribution les familles invitées à bord ainsi que les
scientifiques. Il ne s’agit pas de leur payer un bateau
puisqu’ils disposent du leur et qu’ils ne souhaitent pas s’en séparer. D’autre
part, l’animation d’émissions familiales par une famille authentique fait
partie du concept même de La OHANA.
Tout le projet de
La OHANA est de joindre 3 univers qui agissent séparément autour d’une même
action : les scientifiques qui analysent, les associations qui agissent et
les familles qui sont aujourd’hui plus considérées comme des spectateurs.
Nous voulons les
réunir pour joindre l’analyse à l’action et inclure la famille dans cette prise
de conscience. Elles seront les témoins et les ambassadrices qu’un changement
est possible. Que nous pouvons, si nous agissons tous à notre niveau, mettre en
place un autre Demain.
Les enfants nous
permettent aussi d’avoir un autre regard sur les différentes missions et
rencontres que nous feront. Ils sont l’avenir et nous devons les inclure au
plus vite dans toute la démarche environnementale. Ils sont spontanés et cela
sert le projet. Nous souhaitons inclure le plus possible les familles, c’est
pour cela que nous avons appelé le projet « OHANA », « FAMILLE »
en hawaïen. Le changement passera par nos enfants.
Ca veut dire quoi « mettre La OHANA à disposition en
marque blanche » ?
Aujourd’hui, des
associations et de grandes ONGs comme le WWF, Jane Goodall, Expédition 7ème
Continent souhaitent avoir accès à un bateau d’exploration, en utilisant leur
marquage et en ayant le droit de faire leur communication. Les navires comme
Tara, Ifremer, Sea Shepherd ou encore Greenpeace ne le permettent pas. La OHANA
le permettra. Ils pourront la louer avec l’équipage et le matériel pour mener
des actions, des expéditions sous leur marque et produire leur contenu sans
être tenu de « signer » La OHANA partout. Notre objectif est de
fournir cette plateforme à tous les acteurs afin qu’ils puissent mener des
actions concrètes et non, de faire connaître la OHANA pour La OHANA. Seul le
résultat compte.

Construct a
maxi trimaran, autonomous, unaffiliated, for activities and meeting of minds, and
to:
Give people hope by producing and airing,
     direct from the ocean's surface, television shows aimed at the general
     public in the form of challenges mixing physical and intellectual tests,
     calling on the assistance of onboard guests (celebrities, enthusiasts,
     scientists, artists, researchers and families from around the world);
Act for the planet by being at the
     disposition of various organizations (NGOs, foundations and companies)
     wishing to protect the environment and promote awareness of its fragility.

La OHANA Team
We are ocean
enthusiasts, families, individuals and specialists wishing to invest in and act
for the protection of the planet. We have a different vision, more
""oceanic,"" fluid, dynamic, open, full of humor, with our values
centered around family. 

Pascal
Bouche :  President of Globe2Child ONGYvan
Bourgnon : La OHANA CaptainJacques
Vapillon : Media ManagerMichael Viret : Partner Manager



This vital project is ambitious. That's why we have gathered a crew of
specialists in both the conception of La
OHANA and the management of the project, without forgetting the details of daily
life in this transoceanic vessel. Each member of the crew has invested far and
beyond the professional level. We are all conscious of participating in the
creation of a collective chef d’œuvre, one we invite you to join, and to which
you may add your own personal touch.

€50,000



We are
launching the project through crowdfunding on Indiegogo to spread the word
about it worldwide, and get people mobilized. Our first objective of €50,000
has been fixed to allow us to create the structure to finance the pilot season.
It will serve to convince partners and broadcasters.

A special
Caribbean Destination OHANA is also
being scripted for a film of 10 episodes at the end of 2015 in Grenada.




How was the Project Born?
Since 2009,
we have crossed the oceans with our 4 children meeting people, learning about
their traditions and their cultures. We wanted to show our children that
another world exists, different from the one we see in the media. During our
stops, we met many people actively working for the good of the planet, on the
regional, local and even the micro-local levels. So many, many people that we
started asking ourselves, ""What would happen if…""


If we could share these local actions with a wider
     public?
If we could highlight these actions in entertaining TV shows, in the form of challenges?

If we could host people, you, aboard a
     boat, to confront these challenges one by one?







What is Special about this Project?
Coming from
a business background of alternative and open-source computer programming, we
imagined a one-of-a-kind exploration vessel, equipped for media activities, a
platform free of access, at the service of large NGOs and foundations, but also
for local organizations and all initiatives wishing to mobilize a large public.

Today, we need
to feature these people who live differently from us or who have an original
way of living their lives. Show their ground-level actions, and the men and
women who live up to the actions they are leading. 
Bring back
hope and help people dream once more!
This is why we will film directly from the ocean on the maxi trimaran using
a ""reality show"" format, but one that will honestly be
""reality"" and of high quality. 



Launch the Movement...

Beyond showing the state of this ocean planet, doing
surveys and research and exposing bad practices, we want to create a movement
to unite the ""crew"" of planet Earth to build this world we all only
dream about now!
It is true
-- the source of all life on Earth is in great danger. What we know less about
is that it also possesses a great power of transformation. The ocean teaches us
to invent a new world, more ecological and communal, where everyone can find
his or her place and origins. 
We want to
give another vision of the defense of this planet and its inhabitants. A point
of view from the oceanic DNA: wide-open, fluid, dynamic, full of humor and
love!
This is the
base concept of La OHANA, one single, human family to conduct communal actions
for the benefit of all.


Perks

All our perks have been calculated to help include you in the project and share with
you this grand adventure. With a wealth of collector items, exclusive to this
crowdfunding, trips to discover the oceanic depths aboard the mini-sub and the
possibility to come aboard La OHANA,

For example,
for 20 Euros, you will receive the OHANA Pass, good for a visit aboard La OHANA during her various stops.
Plus, if you
are a resident of the EEC, your donations are tax
deductible, and you may benefit from the fact, according to the legislation in
vigor in your country.

of the great navigator.
This voyage will also pay homage to Magellan's crew, who succeeded in
returning to their home port in the absence of their captain, offering hope to
our situation on spaceship Earth, which seems to have lost its captain and
whose crew seems a bit lost... 




Challenges

●  Be the first to propose
a concept blending Ocean, Family Spirit,
Environment and the Web.
●  Develop programs and
tools necessary for gaining knowledge of and protecting life, in a framework
that is  entertaining and interactive.
●  Become a living laboratory and a
""porthole"" into the ocean.
●  Become an essential actor in the protection of
our planet.
●  Be a symbol of life and
the future of humanity.




Constraints
● The design and
construction of a multi-hull of this size is a crucial factor in this project.
This is the occasion to look deep into what it takes today to build an
exploration vessel with the least possible environmental impact, to build an
oceanic vessel of the future, while remaining within a reasonable budget.  
● Develop an ambitious,
innovative multimedia project requires mastering the computer and logistical
levels.
● An enterprise like this
is necessarily a human adventure, so deserves being shared at every stage.



 
Your Budget is Tight? You want to participate but it's not the right time?
NO PROBLEM!
Share the news with everyone around you, invite your friends, let them know
about our project and send us your contacts. 
As
compensation, we will give you the ""OHANA Pass"" to thank you for your

The birthplace of man and the place that dances in our dreams. Where the seeds
of civilization have grown into vibrant cultures and dynamic communities, spreading
throughout the world. The mysterious beauty of the landscape and people of
Africa is undeniable. And though so many of us have envisioned life in Africa -
the people, the forests, the wildlife and the culture – seldom do we have the
opportunity to make those dreams come true. </p>
<p><i><b>But what of the dreams of people
in Africa? </b></i></p>
<p>Despite being one of
the poorest countries in the world, the people of Tanzania share a common trait
of joy and hope for the future. They dream of a better life for their children –
sending them to school and to a world beyond the rural village. They dream of
clean water for their families. They dream of a livelihood that not only
provides for their family but is in concert with the environment. They dream of
a good life, rooted in their connection to the earth, but striving for the
stars.</p>
<p>GOSESO is <span>an environmentally-conscious school and village outreach
project in Eastern Africa, located in the heart of the Kitobe Forest near Lake
Tanganyika in western Tanzania. GOSESO thrives in the midst of one of the
poorest places on earth, surrounded by the joy of the people who live there,
the sheer beauty of the surroundings, and the potential for an enduring
partnership between the community and the environment. The GOSESO campus
provides biodiversity research, conservation, and environmental and cultural education.
Since 2007, GOSESO has been bridging human and wildlife prosperity
through education for rural Africans with a focus on self-reliance, economic
and cultural vitality, human and wildlife health, and peace education.</span></p>

<p>Lincoln,
Illinois is a heavily traveled Route 66 community midway between St.
Louis and Chicago, but few of its Route 66 attractions remain open. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>	To partially
remedy that situation, a group of volunteers have formed the
501(c)(3) Route 66 Heritage Foundation of Logan County to help preserve
county sites affiliated with the famous Mother Road. <br/></p>

<p>	The premiere
project tackled by the group is saving the Mill restaurant, a
derelict building that was once a hotspot on a portion of Route 66
that ran through Lincoln. The plan is to use the building as a
tourist attraction and a Route 66 museum. 
</p>
<p>	A great deal
has been accomplished at The Mill – including a new roof, new and
replacement windows and restoration of the downstairs floor and
foundation - but there is still much to do.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>First,
a contractor must be hired to finish wiring the facility for
electricity. The walls need to be insulated from the inside and the
large holes and damaged floor behind the bar area downstairs and the
front area upstairs need to be replaced. Knotty pine must be rehung
behind the bar and drywall ceilings and an HVAC system must be
installed. A small addition must be added to the back of the facility
that will house a handicap restroom and handicap entrance. <b>The cost
for completing the project will be $93,900. All donations are tax-deductible.<br/></b></p>

</div><h3>More About The Mill</h3><div>
</div><p> </p><div>
</div><p>Paul
Coddington of Lincoln formally opened his restaurant at the corner of
Washington St. and Stringer Ave. on July 25, 1929, under the name of
the Blue Mill. As a special treat that night, his manager's children dressed in
Dutch costumes with wooden shoes and passed out roses to all of the
patrons.</p><div>
</div><p>    	The eatery
was constructed by local contractors in the shape of a small Dutch
windmill with sails on the front. The building had blue trim and the
continuously turning sails were decorated with lights. Waitresses,
dressed in blue with white aprons, served food on plates from the
Illinois China Company that were emblazoned with a “Blue Mill”
design. <br/></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1297338/files/20150315170703-mill-1946.jpg?1426464423"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
</div><p>	One of the
opening day specials was fried ham with peanut butter on toast with
mayonnaise and head lettuce – three high. Soon, the Blue Mill
became known for serving patrons grilled sandwiches at any time of
the day or night.</p><div>
</div><p>	The small
shop, which was located on Old Route 66 near the Lincoln
Developmental Center, enjoyed much success for several years
thereafter.  
</p><div>
</div><p>	Heavily
reliant on other area businesses, the establishment served meats from
Eckert's Market, locally made Marcucci ice cream and soft drinks from
the Chero-Cola Bottling Company in Springfield, Ill. 
</p><div>
</div><p>	On Sept. 9,
1936, Raymond Hickman purchased the property, His wife, Fern, who had
formerly operated a private catering service, took over supervision
of the kitchen. Hickman enjoyed squirrel hunting and he liked to
share his bounty with his customers. On at least one occasion in the
1930s, he was said to have served a squirrel dinner at The Mill.</p><div>
</div><p>	In 1945,
Blossom Huffman purchased The Mill, unbeknownst to her husband,
Albert. He, nevertheless, ended up helping to run the establishment.
The Huffmans obtained, at no cost, an old Army barracks from Fort
Ellis in Ipava, IL. Fort Ellis served as a detention camp for World
War II prisoners of war.

moved one barracks building to Lincoln and attached it to the back of
the original restaurant and painted the entire building barn red.
They operated the business as a restaurant, bar and dance hall, with
live country bands on weekends.
</div><p>	Albert
replaced the sails of the windmill once in 1945, and then had to do
the repair job a second time after his handiwork was destroyed by a
storm.   
</p><div>
</div><p>	During a
get-together at the Mill a few years ago, a former truck driver who
delivered soda pop for the restaurant recalled Albert Huffman. ""He
had muscles the size of my head,"" the man said. ""He never
had to throw anyone out; he just showed them to the door.""</p><div>
</div><p>	Colorful
customers at the Mill included Coonhound Johnny, a local bootlegger,
and the notorious Chicago mobster Al Capone and many of his cohorts.</p><div>
</div><p>	In the 1950s
and '60s, Lincoln was plagued with illegal gambling activities
centering on pinball machines, and The Mill was implicated in the
illegal activities.  
</p><div>
</div><p>	One of the
restaurant's claims to fame was its fried schnitzel, originally made
of veal and later of pork. Louise “Mom” Rofschansky brought the
original viener schnitzel recipe with her from Austria. The cook
introduced the sandwich to Blossom, who Americanized it and made it a
Mill specialty. </p><div>
</div><p>	Blossom passed
the recipe – and the restaurant – on to her son George and his
wife, Eleanor. Next in line were George and Eleanor's son and
daughter-in-law, Randy and Teresa. Blossom's great-grandson, Brian,
and his wife, Cheri, use the same schnitzel recipe today at Hallie's
restaurant in downtown Lincoln.</p><div>
</div><p>	Along with the
schnitzel, Blossom developed a tangy sauce that the restaurant used
on the sandwiches and sold in jars for take-out. </p><div>

</div><p>	By the
mid-1980s the Mill had lost most of the Dutch-themed interior and
along with its food offered a museum of strange objects. A mechanical
leg appeared to have just kicked its way through a hole in the
ceiling. Additional oddities included four life-sized figures, a suit
of armor and a 20-pound stuffed catfish. 
</p><div>
</div><p>	There
was also a “jack-in-the-box toilet” that made noise when one
raised the lid. Albert once explained, ""I
had to keep changing things so people would come down here and see
what the crazy nut was doing now.""</p><div>
</div><p>	The
Mill closed in 1996, and stood deteriorating for many years, the
subject of increasing neighborhood complaints about unsafe
conditions. Ernie Edwards, owner of the famous Pig Hip restaurant on
Route 66 in Broadwell, pleaded for the building to be saved for use
as a museum, especially after his own Pig Hip Museum burned. 
</p><div>
</div><p>	In
2005, The Mill was sold for taxes, but the new owner could not afford
to demolish it due to costly commercial demolition regulations. A year later, then
Logan County Tourism Director Geoff  Ladd stepped up to work with
Edwards and other supporters in an effort to save the building. 
</p><div>
</div><p>	In
2006, The Route 66 Heritage Foundation of Logan County was created to
promote and preserve Route 66 sites in Logan County. Working with the
owner and city council members, the organization managed to save the
building from the wrecking ball and gain title to the property.</p><div>
</div><p>	Using
the property as collateral, Regions Bank in Lincoln advanced a
$20,000 loan, which was used to pay for the abatement and demolition
of two later additions on the side and back of the building. These
sections were not in salvageable condition.</p><div>
</div><p>	This
left a large, cellar-sized pit on the north side of the building,
where the restaurant kitchen once stood. For two years, Contractors
Ready Mix brought their leftover dry materials to The Mill and dumped
them in the pit. Finally, the filled pit was topped with concrete. 
</p><div>
</div><p>	An
early fundraiser was the Route 66 Garage Sale, co-sponsored by the
foundation and the local tourism bureau, and spearheaded by Bruce
Huskins. At its peak, the sale covered 37 miles of Route 66 in Logan
County and included approximately 100 vendors.  An estimated 20,000
people visited the various locations in 2009.</p><div>
</div><p>	The
sale continues but due to a lack of volunteers has been taken over by
another organization. An outgrowth of this activity has been the
establishment of a flea market, which is held during the warmer
months inside the Mill. 
</p><div>
</div><p>	This
year, flea markets have been scheduled for the second Saturday of the
month, April through October. Fees from the rental space go to the
Route 66 Heritage Foundation to continue renovation of the building. <br/></p><div>

</div></div>","Project Summary 
Lincoln,
Illinois is a heavily traveled Route 66 community midway between St.
Louis and Chicago, but few of its Route 66 attractions remain open. 



	To partially
remedy that situation, a group of volunteers have formed the
501(c)(3) Route 66 Heritage Foundation of Logan County to help preserve
county sites affiliated with the famous Mother Road. 


	The premiere
project tackled by the group is saving the Mill restaurant, a
derelict building that was once a hotspot on a portion of Route 66
that ran through Lincoln. The plan is to use the building as a
tourist attraction and a Route 66 museum. 

	A great deal
has been accomplished at The Mill – including a new roof, new and
replacement windows and restoration of the downstairs floor and
foundation - but there is still much to do.
   What We Need & What You Get 
First,
a contractor must be hired to finish wiring the facility for
electricity. The walls need to be insulated from the inside and the
large holes and damaged floor behind the bar area downstairs and the
front area upstairs need to be replaced. Knotty pine must be rehung
behind the bar and drywall ceilings and an HVAC system must be
installed. A small addition must be added to the back of the facility
that will house a handicap restroom and handicap entrance. The cost
for completing the project will be $93,900. All donations are tax-deductible.

Here's what you get from your donation level:



$15 Individual Donation: Includes one year membership and free tour of The Mill (transportation not provided).


$25 Business/Organization Donation: Includes one year membership and free tour of The Mill (transportation not provided).


$50 Donation: Includes free collectible Bob Waldmire Mill print, one year membership and free tour of The Mill (transportation not provided).


$66 Donation: Includes free collectible Bob Waldmire Mill print, 8x10 glossy photo of The Mill, one year membership and free tour of The Mill (transportation not provided).


$100 Donation: Includes free limited edition Save The Mill t-shirt, free collectible Bob Waldmire Mill print, one year membership and free tour of The Mill (transportation not provided).


$500 & Above Donation: Includes hand-made apron (like Blossum might have worn), free limited edition Save The Mill t-shirt, free collectible Bob Waldmire Mill print, one year membership and free tour of The Mill (transportation not provided).


Donations in any amount are welcome. PayPal and check-by-mail donations can be made at www.savethemill.org. We accept International Donations at all pricing levels.   The Impact 
The Mill is
considered a prime example of early American roadside architecture
and is one of the few buildings in the area still standing from that
era. 
Opening the Mill will add to the number of Route 66 visitors and increase both civic pride and economic development in this rural, central Illinois community.




In
2006, The Route 66 Heritage Foundation of Logan County was created. The
foundation will attempt to use the funds raised through this campaign
as matching money for any available grants. The goal for completing
the renovation work is in time for the annual October celebration in
2015.

It is our goal to grow vegetables and gardeners as sustainably as possible by using products that are local, renewable, post consumer or made using sustainable practices. At The Grateful Garden we consider every homegrown vegetable as a win for the Earth.  Imagine if every person were to grow just one tomato a summer how much petroleum would be saved each year shipping billions less tomatoes around the world. Better yet Imagine if they grew those tomatoes using Biochar. Sustainably created biochar is a powerfully simple tool that can 1) fight global warming; 2) produce a soil enhancer that holds carbon and makes soil more fertile; 3) reduce agricultural waste; and 4) produce clean, renewable energy. </p><p>This campaign is important because it will help us fund the installation of biochar into our garden, raise awareness about biochar and give contributors the opportunity to fund an action day that will benefit our local economy and the environment.  As well those who can attend the Earth Day Bioblitz will learn and participate in a sustainable and fun Earth Day event while learning ways to build sustainable home gardens.</p><p>We are looking to raise $5000 dollars in order to cover the cost of 120 bags of BioChar Source which will enable us to amend six rows ( 3’w X 100’L)  equalling 1800 square feet of growing area.

It is our goal to grow vegetables and gardeners as sustainably as possible by using products that are local, renewable, post consumer or made using sustainable practices. At The Grateful Garden we consider every homegrown vegetable as a win for the Earth.  Imagine if every person were to grow just one tomato a summer how much petroleum would be saved each year shipping billions less tomatoes around the world. Better yet Imagine if they grew those tomatoes using Biochar. Sustainably created biochar is a powerfully simple tool that can 1) fight global warming; 2) produce a soil enhancer that holds carbon and makes soil more fertile; 3) reduce agricultural waste; and 4) produce clean, renewable energy. This campaign is important because it will help us fund the installation of biochar into our garden, raise awareness about biochar and give contributors the opportunity to fund an action day that will benefit our local economy and the environment.  As well those who can attend the Earth Day Bioblitz will learn and participate in a sustainable and fun Earth Day event while learning ways to build sustainable home gardens.We are looking to raise $5000 dollars in order to cover the cost of 120 bags of BioChar Source which will enable us to amend six rows ( 3’w X 100’L)  equalling 1800 square feet of growing area.

<p>On Tu b’Shevat 2013, Jewcology will conclude our Year of Learning.  In appropriate Jewish fashion, we will turn immediately from this year of <em>learning</em> to applying our new wisdom through <em>action</em>. </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Year of Action: Bal Tashchit (Do Not Destroy)</span></strong></p>
<p>In 2013, we will organize a Year of Action, focusing on the Jewish mitzvah of Bal Tashchit (avoiding “unnecessary destruction” or “waste”).  We will focus on two key actions, both especially relevant for reducing waste in the Jewish community: reducing energy use, and avoiding food waste. </p>
<p><strong><em>Reducing Energy Use:</em></strong></p>
<p>Saving energy is very important to address today’s environmental concerns, and recognized by the Talmud as a part of the mitzvah of Bal Tashchit.  Every Jewish institution can make a difference and also save money but streamlining their energy use.  This project will empower Jewish individuals and institutions to take action and model sustainable energy use.</p>
<p><strong><em>Avoiding Food Waste:</em></strong></p>
<p>In synagogues, in schools, at Kiddush and in our own refrigerators, the Jewish community has an opportunity to reduce the edible (or recently spoiled) food that we throw away.  </p>
<p>As part of our Year of Action, Canfei Nesharim’s food waste program will include a monthly blog posting encouraging individuals to take specific actions to reduce their food waste.  The posts will include tools like menu and shopping planners, instructions for how to find your local food bank, and recipes to spice up leftovers before they go bad.  </p>
<p><em><strong>Measurable Results:</strong></em></p>
<div>
<p>To measure the results of change, we will create and post website calculators on Jewcology to enable individuals to measure their impact and see the collective impact of their actions.  For example, people will have the opportunity to check a box indicating specific actions (such as using a smart powerstrip, changing lightbulbs, or turning down the thermostat) and will be able to see how much energy will be saved by them, and by the entire Jewcology community throughout the year. </p>
<p>The calculators and their results will also be promoted to our network of change agents and to the global Jewcology community.</p>

<h2><font color=""#222222""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21.75px;""><i>The Problem</i></span></font></h2></span><p>There are about 750 pure, wild greenback cutthroat trout in the world, all living an extremely fragile existence in an unlikely place - Bear Creek, a small stream west of Colorado Springs, CO.  Such a small population of mature fish put them at risk of poor genetic diversity, and the creek itself is at high risk of significant damage from erosion, wildfires, and human impacts like poor trails, motorized trails, rogue campsites, and unauthorized angling.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/169573/files/20131101145645-BearCreek1.jpeg?1383343005"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><i>Greenback Cutthroat Trout History</i></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Like all of Colorado’s native cutthroat trout, greenbacks were
pushed to the brink of extinction through overfishing, development and pollution
as Colorado was settled and developed in the early 1900’s, leading to the
presumed extinction of the species in the 1930's.  However in the late 1960’s, scientists
discovered what they <i>thought</i> were relic populations of greenbacks.  In an attempt to repopulate the species they harvested and used these fish as the broodstock for stocking activity throughout Colorado's Front Range.  As a result, the species was downgraded from ""endangered"" to ""threatened"" status in 1978.  It was named the State Fish of Colorado in 1994.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">However, over the past couple decades the identity of those
re-populated “greenbacks” was called into question.  Advances in genetic testing indicated those repopulated fish were actually another species of cutthroat – the Colorado River
cutthroat. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Fortunately, samples of greenbacks and other cutthroats were collected throughout Colorado and preserved by scientists in the late 1800’s, but only until recently did the
technology exist to accurately test them due to their age.  In 2010, samples of contemporary fish,  including the fish
from Bear Creek (tested due to their distinct and unique physical
characteristics versus other cutthroats) were tested against those historical samples. 
The results yielded a roadmap to cutthroat populations throughout the
state:  two species were extinct, 3
reside in other watersheds, and one genetically pure population of greenback
cutthroat had persevered and reside in Bear Creek.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">How the greenbacks came to live in Bear Creek is an
unlikely story unto itself.  An entrepreneur owned property in the area and ventured to cash in on tourists
making their way up Pikes Peak.  As part
of his attractions he built a pond suitable for fishing. Since Bear Creek
was historically fishless at that point he collected some fish from a nearby
South Platte river tributary to stock it.  As it turned out those fish were greenback cutthroat trout, direct predecessors of the
current population. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>

<br/></span><p></p>
<p><b><i>Our Goal</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Bear Creek, and its greenback residents, is at high risk of elimination due to fire and erosion.  We are raising funds for:</span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Restoring and maintaining the access road next to Bear Creek to prevent further erosion from entering the stream and damaging the habitat for its resident greenback cutthroats.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Proliferation of greenbacks through supporting stocking programs and the gear required for our volunteers to successfully pack fish into remote areas.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Seed money to leverage larger grants for in-stream restoration projects.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Through the generous donations of the fly fishing industry, the time of our 100% volunteer organization, and the support of Colorado Trout Unlimited, we have accumulated a very impressive collection of perks to help us meet our goal.  Please give as generously as you can so that we can all have a chance to feel the tug of a wild greenback cutthroat trout on the end of our lines.  Please also share this initiative with other like-minded anglers and conservationists wherever you can.  </span></p>

Greenback Cutthroat Trout History
Like all of Colorado’s native cutthroat trout, greenbacks were
pushed to the brink of extinction through overfishing, development and pollution
as Colorado was settled and developed in the early 1900’s, leading to the
presumed extinction of the species in the 1930's.  However in the late 1960’s, scientists
discovered what they thought were relic populations of greenbacks.  In an attempt to repopulate the species they harvested and used these fish as the broodstock for stocking activity throughout Colorado's Front Range.  As a result, the species was downgraded from ""endangered"" to ""threatened"" status in 1978.  It was named the State Fish of Colorado in 1994.
However, over the past couple decades the identity of those
re-populated “greenbacks” was called into question.  Advances in genetic testing indicated those repopulated fish were actually another species of cutthroat – the Colorado River
cutthroat. 
Fortunately, samples of greenbacks and other cutthroats were collected throughout Colorado and preserved by scientists in the late 1800’s, but only until recently did the
technology exist to accurately test them due to their age.  In 2010, samples of contemporary fish,  including the fish
from Bear Creek (tested due to their distinct and unique physical
characteristics versus other cutthroats) were tested against those historical samples. 
The results yielded a roadmap to cutthroat populations throughout the
state:  two species were extinct, 3
reside in other watersheds, and one genetically pure population of greenback
cutthroat had persevered and reside in Bear Creek.
How the greenbacks came to live in Bear Creek is an
unlikely story unto itself.  An entrepreneur owned property in the area and ventured to cash in on tourists
making their way up Pikes Peak.  As part
of his attractions he built a pond suitable for fishing. Since Bear Creek
was historically fishless at that point he collected some fish from a nearby
South Platte river tributary to stock it.  As it turned out those fish were greenback cutthroat trout, direct predecessors of the
current population. 



Our Goal


Bear Creek, and its greenback residents, is at high risk of elimination due to fire and erosion.  We are raising funds for:


Restoring and maintaining the access road next to Bear Creek to prevent further erosion from entering the stream and damaging the habitat for its resident greenback cutthroats.
Proliferation of greenbacks through supporting stocking programs and the gear required for our volunteers to successfully pack fish into remote areas.
Seed money to leverage larger grants for in-stream restoration projects.

Through the generous donations of the fly fishing industry, the time of our 100% volunteer organization, and the support of Colorado Trout Unlimited, we have accumulated a very impressive collection of perks to help us meet our goal.  Please give as generously as you can so that we can all have a chance to feel the tug of a wild greenback cutthroat trout on the end of our lines.  Please also share this initiative with other like-minded anglers and conservationists wherever you can.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Thea and I am a participant of the Youth initiative program, 
YIP in YtterjÃ¤rna, Sweden. Together with Clara I am going to Findhorn 
for an  Internship to attend a course on Permaculture, community-living, 
alternative currency, alternative energy, house construction, earth-healing
 ect .. and in order to attend this course and pay for travel expanses, 
we would appreciate your help to either donate a little bit of money or 
spread this website to someone who can.. <br/>We see that the learning, 
inspiration and insights we gain at Findhorn, can benefit the whole Yip 
and YtterjÃ¤rna community, and hopefully a lot more people further in our 
path.<br/>My personal focus will be to investigate the direct 
relationship between the consumer and the producer, fx: the fact that all 
the food you eat is produced by your neighbour. I would like to 
investigate what this means for our way of consuming and valuing our 
food, if this has an impact on our relationship to and way of using money, on the 
relationship we have to each other and to the nature. I am already 
investigating this in JÃ¤rna, working with the local restaurant that only
 provides food from local organic and biodynamic farmers, and tries to 
create a direct relationship between the farmer, the cook and the 
consumer in the restaurant.  I would like to bring this project further, 
bring an angle that includes way more aspects of society and through a 
website ( <a href=""http://www.feedingjarna.withtank.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.feedingjarna.withtank.com</a>) and video, let it be an inspiration that reaches over the 
boarders of YtterjÃ¤rna. I think Findhorn can help me get a more clear 
picture of how everything is interconnected and how to give the website a
 more global thinking as Findhorn has all aspects of society in a little
 community. So in order to do this I need the knowledge and I think 
Findhorn is the perfect place to gain this..<br/> Therefore, beautiful people, I kindly ask you for a small donation.. In the end hopefully it will benefit us all.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My name is Clara, I'm studying with Thea and we both hold the quite same vision of the relationship between human being and their food, Iâ€™m interested in knowing what  quality the food will bring us if we know from where does it come from and if we are being part of the process in a active way and not just consuming. I'm interested in the daily life that they have in Findhorn and how it affects and inspire people that are not part of that environment.  It is important to me to see people who are living in a sustainable way and to learn from them,  further on,  to bring it to my daily life and embody what Iâ€™ll need in order to grow in this life. I have future projects that relate a lot to this kind of approach to human being and earth. I see community life as one of the major keys for a better world.<br/>Thank you for nay contribution and your support through the path I'm walking.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We see so clearly how important it is to be part of this training, we can 
see it in our future and from calls we've been receiving in our past. We 
have a month for an Internship in our YIP program, which we want to spend
 at Findhorn, getting to know their work and their ways of living. It is so 
important for the continuation of our future, to realise our
 dreams and to practice sustainable living. And we see this as having an impact on three different levels: our selves, 
people around us and the world; <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">because the way we live has a direct impact on the world as we all are interconnected.</span><br/>


It will therefore be fruitful for many others around us, as we hope to embody the
 wisdom the Findhron community holds and to make it accessible for our friends and others that might be interested.  </p>

My Story


Hello! My name is Melissa Lafontaine, I am a 24 year old Canadian/ American living in the vibrant city of Montreal. In just two months I will depart from my comfortable life in Montreal for the mysterious, richly bio-diverse, politically challenged and poverty stricken country of Madagascar. A country with 80% of its biodiversity seen nowhere else in the world, 'inconnu' to many. Many of you who have been a part of my life during the last several years know that I am a nature lover dedicated to environmental sustainability and community connectivity. I moved from my much missed community of Colorado Springs a year ago to learn French in Quebec with hopes to to open the door to work in the field of international development. After spending the past year translating my thoughts into broken yet now workable French sentences, volunteering for the Global Campaign for Climate Action(http://tcktcktck.org/) and filling out a slew of competitive international development volunteer applications I have *excitingly* been accepted to serve as a volunteer with the World Wildlife Funds, EXPLORE- Youth Volunteer Programme in the Midgony-Atsimo Forest Corridor in Madagascar! In addition to the conservation work I will be doing in Madagascar, I have high hopes of adding in a personalized creative project to collectively involve those who have been a part of my journey in the past, and those who will commit to support me and follow me as I am in Magnifique Madagascar via my Blog Spot at (http://lafontainewwf.blogspot.com/) 

Madagascar and the WWF Explore Programme
The Moist Forests in South-Eastern Madagascar contain a very rich biodiversity, and the development of its flora and fauna is spectacular thanks to a very favorable climate. However, this is threatened by the activities of the local population whose lives depend on the forest's natural resources.With a view towards the participatory management of forests with local communities, WWF has been implementing the Community Forestry Project in Midongy du Sud in three stages since 2003. The project is funded by the Swedish National Development Agency (SIDA). WWF’s mission is to protect, develop and restore the forest for the well-being of the local communities. WWF’s intervention sites in the Midongy du Sud region are located in the Forest Corridor between the Midongy du Sud Befotaka National Park and the Vondrozo Forest Reserve. The implementation is carried out in the framework of three main sections: 1) Forest conservation; 2) Gender approach, and 3) Development of alternatives to slash and burn cultivation (tavy).
 

The goal of the WWF volunteer programme is to provide young environmental leaders with a powerful, direct experience of the unique challenges developing nations face in protecting their environment and its assets and to share these challenges and  tangible solutions through photography, compelling stories, media and videos. WWF encourages its volunteers to share this project with otthers in hopes to INSPIRE others to support  the growth of naturally protected areas such as the Forest Corridor of Midongy and become stewards for the encouragement and practice of environmental responsibility in theireveryday lives.  
 
http://wwf.panda.org/how_you_can_help/volunteer/
The Impact
I will be working within the Forest Corridor of Midongy- Atsimo with the World Wildlife Funds Youth Volunteer Program in establishment of a new protected area and will be involved with a range of activities such as the collection of field data, consultations with local communities, and building infrastructure support. My role as a volunteer includes observation and data collection of the lemur population; contributing to the local knowledge of the importance of their protection and the role they play in stabilizing global biodiversity. I will participate in sustainable projects such as aiding the locals in the fabrication and utilization of compost, serving as an environmental educator in primary schools, and reinforcing the local community to have responsibility towards educating their youth with the environment in mind.  I will be living in remote poverty stricken areas, with some of the most under represented populations.  As I conduct these projects I will be documenting my experience through photography and upon my return will hold a photography exhibition, pairing each photograph with an environmental fact and real time story. I will also be engaging the children through providing art supplies and environmentally inspired art projects in my free time. I hope to bring back several creations from the children to display in the exhibit as well. 
 
Your support 
The support you will be providing me is to initially help offset the costs of travel expenses to Madagascar and the cost of living, ultimately enabling me to serve as a volunteer with no income for 3 months. The remaining support raised will be used to buy useful products for the children, women and men in the villages such as mirrors, socks, shoes, toothpaste and soap ect (whatever appears to be the biggest need). 
Each supporter will be mentioned on my blog and will receive a personal e-mail update of the progress and highlights of the project. Those who give $100 or more will receive a printed photograph. Those who give $250 or more will receive 2 printed photographs, including a black and white film photo displayed at the exhibition.

a school of 350 illuminated batik salmon windsocks held aloft on bamboo poles
to “swim” through the streets of Paris during the UN Climate talks (COP21) in
December 2015. Your help is needed!</span><br/></p>
<p>Standing for the salmon is
standing for nature. Wild salmon indicate healthy forests and streams. When
waterways can no longer support salmon, nature’s ability to continue supporting
any life there is also at risk. People all over the world are already
suffering the terrible consequences of climate chaos, but together we can turn
this around.</p>
<p>Salmon swim upstream
seemingly against all odds to ensure future generations, and so must we. People
from around the world will carry 350 artist-made salmon windsocks outside the
international climate conference, visually speaking for people and species who have
no voice. When the large school of fish moves as one, the performance will
symbolize the power of people working together to protect what we love.</p>

<p><b>Salmon as a Climate
Delegation</b></p>
<p><i>This project expresses our
desire to inspire the awakening of the heart and reverence for our natural
world through beauty. We believe creative expression calls to our deeper
connections with nature and each other.</i></p>
<p>We’ve learned from doing artful activism and
collaborating with other grassroots groups that pictures have an immediate
impact and move people without the use of language. Images that are beautiful
and hopeful inspire people to take positive action. </p>
<p>As much as this project is about making salmon
illuminate the streets of Paris, it is also about making connections with and
between people who are inspired to act on behalf of the natural world that
sustains all life. Moving 350 salmon will require the coordination of 150-
175 people moving together, and the collaboration of even more (including YOU!).  </p><p>
<span>People from all over the world will be at the UN
Climate Summit, and so will the media. </span>We want to create images that
will remind all of us that the beauty of the natural world comes with a
responsibility to care for living beings. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Why 350?</b></p>
<p>The number 350 is
significant -- 350 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere is the point above which the thin atmosphere covering Earth and
keeping temperatures relatively stable, starts trapping too much solar heat.
This causes global warming which results in changes in weather patterns, droughts, floods,
melting ice, rising seas, wildfires, and super storms.</p>
<p>We are currently above 400 ppm
and by continuing to burn oil, coal, and gas at the present rate, we are adding
2 ppm of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. ""Unless we are able to
rapidly turn that around and return to below 350 ppm this century, we risk
triggering tipping points and irreversible impacts that could send climate
change spinning truly beyond our control.” ~ Dr. James Hansen, former head
of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b><span><br/></span></b></p><p><b><span>Our Budget </span></b></p>
<p>Our costs (in US Dollars) cover
materials and travel, lodging, and food for our team of three. All of the labor is
donated.  We are grateful to all of the people who are batiking, painting,
and sewing the salmon and providing other assistance to make this vision a
reality! </p>

</div></div>","Salmon is Life, a Seattle-based delegation of artists and organizers, will take
a school of 350 illuminated batik salmon windsocks held aloft on bamboo poles
to “swim” through the streets of Paris during the UN Climate talks (COP21) in
December 2015. Your help is needed!
Standing for the salmon is
standing for nature. Wild salmon indicate healthy forests and streams. When
waterways can no longer support salmon, nature’s ability to continue supporting
any life there is also at risk. People all over the world are already
suffering the terrible consequences of climate chaos, but together we can turn
this around.
Salmon swim upstream
seemingly against all odds to ensure future generations, and so must we. People
from around the world will carry 350 artist-made salmon windsocks outside the
international climate conference, visually speaking for people and species who have
no voice. When the large school of fish moves as one, the performance will
symbolize the power of people working together to protect what we love.
We are not
fighting for nature.
 We are
nature defending itself.                                          - Climate Games

Salmon as a Climate
Delegation
This project expresses our
desire to inspire the awakening of the heart and reverence for our natural
world through beauty. We believe creative expression calls to our deeper
connections with nature and each other.
We’ve learned from doing artful activism and
collaborating with other grassroots groups that pictures have an immediate
impact and move people without the use of language. Images that are beautiful
and hopeful inspire people to take positive action. 
As much as this project is about making salmon
illuminate the streets of Paris, it is also about making connections with and
between people who are inspired to act on behalf of the natural world that
sustains all life. Moving 350 salmon will require the coordination of 150-
175 people moving together, and the collaboration of even more (including YOU!).  
People from all over the world will be at the UN
Climate Summit, and so will the media. We want to create images that
will remind all of us that the beauty of the natural world comes with a
responsibility to care for living beings. 
Why 350?
The number 350 is
significant -- 350 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere is the point above which the thin atmosphere covering Earth and
keeping temperatures relatively stable, starts trapping too much solar heat.
This causes global warming which results in changes in weather patterns, droughts, floods,
melting ice, rising seas, wildfires, and super storms.
We are currently above 400 ppm
and by continuing to burn oil, coal, and gas at the present rate, we are adding
2 ppm of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. ""Unless we are able to
rapidly turn that around and return to below 350 ppm this century, we risk
triggering tipping points and irreversible impacts that could send climate
change spinning truly beyond our control.” ~ Dr. James Hansen, former head
of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

and in the busy art space on site in NY with anyone who wanted to help.
She finds this work energizing and fun, and loves connecting with people while
creating and displaying beautiful evocative imagery to invite more and more
people to open their hearts, find their power, and join the climate justice
movement.
Denise Henrikson has been making and teaching celebration art and coordinating
community arts events for over twenty years. She fell in love with salmon when
she saw Sockeye spawning in the Cedar River in 2001 and has been experimenting
with making different styles of illuminated salmon puppets ever since.
 Denise was one of the early instigators of Seattle’s Fremont Summer
Solstice Parade and was on the team that was awarded Neighborhood Matching Funds
to build the Fremont Troll. ArtsAGlow, a lantern festival Denise launched in
2007, recently received the Spotlight Award for Best Arts and Cultural
programming by Washington Recreation & Park Association (WRPA). During the
ShellNo! Campaign in Seattle, Denise coordinated the World Environment Day
Luminary Flotilla with the Backbone Campaign and was inspired to make a school
of salmon windSockeye that has continued to grow.

<br/>Mankind blows the same amount of CO2 into the atmosphere within 1 year, that nature took 1 million years to store underground. With severe consequences to our planet. What do we <i>personally</i> do to remedy this?<br/>

Which story do you tell about what you have done since 2015, to help your planet provide you with all you need? <br/><br/>You are already writing this story. Every day.

The Khangela Eco Lodge is a model project for a fun <u>and</u> future-proof way of living. We human beings are creatures of habit and rather change-resistant by nature. So, any endeavor aiming at transition is only as good as it's comprehensible, tangible ...and brought to life in a no-string, convincingly delightful, first-hand experience. 
<br/><br/>And <i>that's</i> exactly what this project is all about.

Every project step is freely scalable and adjustable to any amount of backing. Will there be additional funding? Yes, which means, that the campaign 
funding sum does not fully reflect the sum available for the realisation of the project.  
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, with the pending steps, that's where your most valued support comes in. :-) Your backing will have an immense impact, e.g. on the size of land that can be secured against conventional 'development'.<br/><br/>

<li>Bamboo is not a tree but a grass. Cut it down and it grows right back.</li>
<li>The bamboo family has over 2 000 members, one for every need.</li>
<li>Giant Bamboo can grow 50 cm/20 inches. Per day!</li>
<li>It can reach a final height of 30 meters/100 feet. In it's first year!</li>
<li>Bamboo has over 1 580 known human uses: Food, cattle feed, timber, furniture, fuel, paper, clothing, medicine, scaffolding, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO73pYQCMx8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">building material</a> and, and, and... ;-)</li>
<li>It sinks 20% more CO2 and produces 35% more oxygen than any tree.</li>
<li>Seeds cost close to nothing: That's why even a contribution of $1 can create a phenomenal impact! It will buy us 10 Giant Bamboo seeds, each with the ability to produce the above described biomass. You can quite literally <b><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Pgqf0rTbY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">watch it grow</a></b>. Each year, for decades. If <i>that's</i> not awesome, than we don't know what is.  ;-)

This wireless, natural bamboo keyboard is not only a true hand-charmer and eye candy (every one seeing ours, immediately wanted to have it) but also robust, functional and just as user as eco friendly. You will quickly forget about laying your hands on chemical plasticizers every day, and instead favour the touch of nature. <br/><br/>Since no two bamboo culms are alike, you will call a handcrafted unicum your own. Every piece an individual item.<br/><br/><b>Features:</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>suitable for Windows95/98/2000/ME/XP/NT/Vista/Win7/Mac/iOS</li>

Mankind blows the same amount of CO2 into the atmosphere within 1 year, that nature took 1 million years to store underground. With severe consequences to our planet. What do we personally do to remedy this?
Let's imagine for a minute, today were the year 2025? Who are you - then? How does your life look like, for you to truely love  living it? Which story do you tell about what you have done since 2015, to help your planet provide you with all you need? You are already writing this story. Every day.


Source: NASA Goddard's Scientific Visualization Studio (video, 34 short, but very impressive, seconds)


We hope to be able to look back in 2025 and say: Yes, we did all we could do with our own hands. And with every other willing hand we could find. Why not yours? Be our guest! :-)


The Khangela Eco Lodge is a model project for a fun and future-proof way of living. We human beings are creatures of habit and rather change-resistant by nature. So, any endeavor aiming at transition is only as good as it's comprehensible, tangible ...and brought to life in a no-string, convincingly delightful, first-hand experience. 
And that's exactly what this project is all about. 
:-)

 Fun Factor     *     Team     *    Land    *    Guest Houses   *    Animals  *   Jobs   *   Road To Perdition  
*   FAQ






Creation of an organic farm & lodge at the Eastern Cape, South Africa
Sinking as much CO2 as possible as contribution to climate
          protection
Bamboo bio-char and therewith terra preta production plus collection of organic waste from supermarkets and restaurants to be turned into compost will help to do just that. Both at the same time providing organic furtilizer.

Keeping bees for honey, as pollinators and to help them survive as a species

Creation of organic clay buildings with off-grid reneable energy

Providing an enticing range of DIY courses, recreational and coaching offers 

Creation of permanent jobs plus volunteer opportunities via  WWOOF

Serving as information hub, multiplier and ""trial site"" for sustainable lifestyles for community members, volunteers, holiday makers - and anyone interested

The Khangela Concept does NOT involve profit maximization, surplus will be plowed back into improving the site or social projects, wherever sensible

Where will all this take place? Take a look at the map.

                                                                                                                   FAQ





What the team does? Working LONG hours  to make the Khangela Eco Lodge happen. With TONS of dedication. For NO pay at all. Which makes LOTS of sense. 

Doesn't it? ;-) 









If one wants to create something of stability, one needs to give it a feasible structure first. Of which the foundation has already been laid:






Company and office registration in South Africa










Opening bank and PayPal account in South Africa










Finding reliable estate agent, tax and business consultants











Finding a comitted Eco Architect in Cape Town, South Africa










Project planning (requirements, costs, suppliers, contacts, laws, tax)










Buying appropriate land in the Eastern Cape, South Africa 










Construction of sun and wind powered clay buildings











Creation of a water-retaining, self-sustaining, 
organic landscape











Aquisition of animals and bees as part of the 'gardening team' ;-)











Creation of jobs (which includes ecological housing and training)












Every project step is freely scalable and adjustable to any amount of backing. Will there be additional funding? Yes, which means, that the campaign

Why we believe, we can create a serious impact? Because we've a powerful ally: ;-)









Bamboo is not a tree but a grass. Cut it down and it grows right back.
The bamboo family has over 2 000 members, one for every need.
Giant Bamboo can grow 50 cm/20 inches. Per day!
It can reach a final height of 30 meters/100 feet. In it's first year!
Bamboo has over 1 580 known human uses: Food, cattle feed, timber, furniture, fuel, paper, clothing, medicine, scaffolding, building material and, and, and... ;-)
It sinks 20% more CO2 and produces 35% more oxygen than any tree.
Seeds cost close to nothing: That's why even a contribution of $1 can create a phenomenal impact! It will buy us 10 Giant Bamboo seeds, each with the ability to produce the above described biomass. You can quite literally watch it grow. Each year, for decades. If that's not awesome, than we don't know what is.  ;-)




Interested in absolutely stunning bamboo architecture? Here's a TED Talk with Elora Hardy about ""Magical houses made of bamboo"". (video, 10:27 min)
The following film (5:03 min) commissioned by INBAR for the World Expo Shanghai, will give you a very comprehensive picture about the incredible power of bamboo:

How might the transformation of vacant land into the Khangela Eco Lodge look like, before and after? The following will give you a pretty good idea (click to enlarge). :-)







    Organic.


Permaculture landscape with bio-pools, food forests, companion planting, free-range animal husbandry. A solid ""No!"" to GMO (genetically modified organisms), chemicals, monoculture.



   Ecologic.Cob, clay, rammed earth, strawbale buildings with living roofs, plus water-treatment wetlands = all natural, fully compostable holiday homes.




   Renewable.

Heating? Bamboo firewood. Electricity? Solar and wind power. Entirely off-grid.




   
        By the ton.


Tons and tons of CO2 per year will be sunk by bamboo and spekboom tree plantations. The nut trees, fruit trees and vegetables will do their bit, too.




    Plenty Plus.


Monocultures destroy jobs, need gas-guzzling heavy machinery and tons of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, fungicides, which destroy soil life. Mixed companion planting just needs caring hands. Which of the two makes more sense?
 

    Resilience through diversity.

Specialisation creates weakness through susceptibility to market fluctuations. Diversity creates flexibility and robustness, strength and self-reliance. The Khangela concept therefore rests on several pillars of income generation:
Bamboo, sold as building material, firewood, bio-char, worm compost etc.

Farm produce, fresh & preserves
Lodge operation
Event location
Seminars, DIY courses, Open Days etc.
Coaching


    Just... well... perfect!!!  ;-)Diversity to the extreme: Dramatic mountains, awesome rivers rich in fish, plenty of unspoilt wilderness teaming with game and bird life, surrounded by numerous National Parks. And all that a comfortable distance from the beautiful Indian Ocean coast and Port Elizabeth with its sea and air port. The Eastern Cape just has it all! :-)

bighead and silver Asian carp.  The
formulations are:
Selective
and Effective
Safer
than current pesticides
Low
cost
When
commercial, the materials will help control these carp and:

Preserve
our rivers’ and lakes’ environment


Maintain
safe water recreation


Support
our economy
Let me
explain how.
Carp are not
native to North America and imperil our water eco-system.  The bighead and silver carp are particularly
worrisome since the fish:

Grow
fast


Have
a strong instinct to migrate


Have
high reproductive rates
In 35 years,
these carp are now established in almost the entire Mississippi river
basin.  In the lower Illinois River, the
fish represent 85+% of the fish population (2012).
                                  United States Geological Survey map, 2010These filter
feeding carp change the water ecology by:

Out
competing native filter feeding fish


Depriving
game fish of prey fish


Concentrating
toxic blue green algae


Turning
the water green.
Water
recreation is threatened:

The
game fish like bass and trout become vulnerable

Jobs are at
risk!  The Chicago Area Water System
(CAWS) is a major trade route between the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes.  Some organizations want to close the CAWS.  Low cost transportation like the CAWS, is key
to a vibrant economy and jobs.
Since 2008,
bi-partisan Congressional laws have funded $200 million to control the
carp.  Some of the program successes
include:

Understanding
the carp biology and behavior


Developing
and implementing effective barriers


Educating
boaters and fishermen


Exploring
new technologies
To control
these fish multiple methods are needed including a new fish pesticide.  Rotenone, the approved pesticide, is non
selective killing most if not all the fish and insects and in high enough
concentrations will poison mammals, including humans.  To use rotenone the EPA requires the

Wearing
protective body suites


Isolating
the treatment area


Cleansing
the water at the end of the procedure.
                                            Applying rotenone to a pondHere is the
value of my invention.  It will give
Federal and State environmental agencies a needed tool to control the Asian
carp population.  The technology works by
taking advantage of the carp’s:
Ability
to eat smaller particle than native filter feeding fish
Lack
of a stomach
Their
behavior

The formulations consist of:
Practiced
industrial process
Vegetable
fats as inert ingredients
Active
ingredients that if not consumed by the fish, convert quickly and safely
materials found in our rivers and lakes. 
One of my formulations is 100% food grade materials.

By using
commercial materials and processes, the formulation cost is very low.
I have shown
bighead carp will eat the powder from the process.
A model
formulation force feed to a bighead carp caused the animal to become lethargic
and jaundice.  A second model formulation
made the fish very lethargic and jaundice and caused fatal internal bleeding.
I filed a
provisional patent on the technology.
Any material
to control, harm or attract any living plant or animal must gain EPA approval,
no matter how safe the material is.  The
EPA’s pesticide program is long and expensive: 18+ months from filing and in
excess of $1 million for consultants, testing and filing fees.
So to
commercialize the formulation I need funds to:

Make
the formulations and demonstrate their efficacy.  Meeting my minimum goal should fund this
step.


To
start the regulatory process, I need significant support, grossing at least $1
million.
I have spent over
$10,000 in addition to countless hours on this project.  Your pledges are need to make, test and gain
regulatory approval to achieve the effective, safer and low cost formulations
to control the invasive Asian carp.
YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!  I
am asking you to “seize the day”, Carpe Diem™! and pledge
to my project:
Preserve
our rivers’ and lakes’ environment


Maintain
safe water recreation


Save
jobs
Carpe Diem™!
Carp Die.  Thank you for your support.Pledge rewards:  This is an important project for the Mississippi River basin's and Great Lakes' environment.  The whole project will require in excess of $1 million to commercialize: making, testing, approvals and initial production.  I follow Cooper's Stage Gate process to ensure the risks are minimized, the project is well defined and each step has goals.  My Linked-In profile should be open for all to read.  If you want to discuss this project please connect with me on Linked In.The value to society of crowd-funding is to spread the risk in early stages of a new technology.  I have invested money and especially time to show the technology has promise.  Meeting my minimum should allow the manufacture of the formulations and scientifically test the materials at a University Extension.  Funds past the minimum will be used for the regulatory process.  Once the concept is proven, other sources of funding are available.  For the project to go forward, I need your donations.                NO SHIPMENTS OUTSIDE THE  UNITED STATES",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>
</p><p><i>The purpose of this research is to determine how the livelihoods of coastal communities in the Dominican Republic are likely to be affected by the expansion and further establishment of marine conservation initiatives, such as protected area (PA) networks.  These include the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), Caribbean Challenge Initiative (CCI), and the Caribbean Biological Corridor (CBC). Connectivity conservation initiatives are increasing in prevalence as a diverse array of benefits are continually being demonstrated through these models, such as marine protected area (MPA) networks. The benefits of these initiatives include, preserving biodiversity and ecosystem services, adapting to climate change impacts,allowing for long term protection of natural resources and threatened species, and supporting the transition into more resilient coastal communities.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>The Dominican Republic is a biodiversity hotspot meaning it's extremely important to conserve the often threatened species in these regions. In order to efficiently secure marine natural resources for the future, the knowledge and concerns of coastal community members must be considered to ensure effective protection and regulation compliance. Therefore there are several other intentions of this research. Firstly, to examine the government frameworks in place and determine the degree to which they consider local resource users in the decision making process for natural resource management.  Secondly, to identify potential opportunities within social-ecological systems to reduce livelihood impacts from conservation efforts, such as the establishment of marine parks or protected areas. Lastly, to assess the perceptions on biodiversity conservation via connectivity initiatives that speak to the DR’s commitment to increasing ecosystem protection and acknowledging the value of MPA and PA networks.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>By gaining insight on the interactions of marine resource stakeholders/users with coastal and marine conservation initiatives within the DR, I hope to achieve the following: document proposed methods for reducing the negative impacts associated with these efforts, determine potential alternatives to traditional subsistence fisheries, and identify possible opportunities that may lie in the tourism realm.
