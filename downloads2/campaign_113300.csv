<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><br/>My name is Lisa, and Robin is my little sister. She's 20, and has cerebral palsy. She's been confined to a wheelchair her entire life. Due to some rather tragic circumstances, she's spent a good deal of her adolescence in numerous foster placements, and the past few years has resided in a nursing home. Even though our family has always done our best to stay close, Robin hasn't really had much of a chance to know much in the way of stability and security. Despite the unfair cards life has dealt her, my sister is a hero to me, and a sheer inspiration. She always has a smile on her face, a sparkle in her eye, and everyone who meets her describes her as perky and cheerful, with a contagious zest for life. My sister Robin is an exceptionally charasmatic young woman with a generous soul and wonderful potential. She still dreams big, and maintains an enthusiastic outlook. Even with everything she has been through, her bubbly spirit motivates us to not give up like others have.<br/>In her current placement, our family has been doing all we can within our power to make sure her needs are met. However, there’s a very important one that is not. Her wheelchair, needed for her to get around, is older, in need of repair and manual only. For her to do the things she wants, like get a job, hang with friends, taking care of herself, getting to therapy, shopping, &amp; more, a power wheelchair would be much better.<br/>Thus, I got together with our family, and we started ""Team Robin"".<br/>With all your help we should be able to raise the funding needed to get Robin the power wheelchair that she deserves.</p>

The Impact
I've watched my little sister struggle for so long, and when we started researching what we could do about her wheelchair, it was realized that a power mobility device will allow her to have a signficantly greater degree of independence and self-sufficiency. This means she'll have greater career options. She'll be able to get out and have a greater social life. This means so many of the things that have held her back before will be out of her way. Doors will be opened that were not before. With a modern wheelchair, she will have options that were not available prior to now.

<p>There are hundreds of travel guide to Paris, but virtually none even mention the city's incredibly rich lesbian and gay culture. I'm specifically reaching out to gay and lesbian visitors to Gay Par-ee, those same-sex-loving travelers who want to learn a little bit more about the role of LGBT men and women in Paris’s incredible history or spend time mixing and mingling with the city’s large, diverse and incredibly welcoming gay community, be it for just a few hours or for your entire Parisian stay. No other city in Europe—and possibly in the entire world—has as large and active a gay community that is supported by as many LGBT-owned or LGBT-friendly businesses as does Paris. There are more than two dozen (yup, two dozen!) gay bars in the city; 25 gay cafes and restaurants, and another dozen-plus that advertise as being gay-friendly; countless gay shops and boutiques; and more than 100 LGBT organizations, including social and cultural groups, athletic leagues, health and support associations and sexual/fetish organizations. And did you know that there are numerous gay and lesbian connections to some of the city’s most popular sightseeing destinations, like Place des Vosges, Pere Lachaise Cemetery and the literary Left Bank? Or that there were (at least) two French kings who preferred the company of men? Of course you didn't, because other Paris travel guides never mention such things. I do! So, if you're a gay person heading to the City of Light and you want some tips on where to learn about YOUR culture and mingle with YOUR people, this guide is a must-have. You won't find the info offered in this guidebook anywhere else!</p>
<p>The LGBT Paris guide will include the following chapters:</p>
<p>1) History of Gay Paris</p>
<p>2) Must-See Gay Sights</p>
<p>3) Sightseeing in the Way-Gay Marais</p>
<p>4) Erotic Art</p>
<p>5) Lesbian Paris</p>
<p>6) Bars, Clubs, Dance Parties and Drag Shows</p>
<p>7) Restaurants</p>
<p>8) Sex Shops, Cruising Bars, Bathhouses and Sex Clubs</p>
<p>9) Shopping</p>
<p>10) Services</p>
<p>11) LGBT Events and Organizations</p>
<p>12) Lodging</p>
<p>I won't just be scratching the surface of Gay Par-ee, I'll be presenting information on EVERY LGBT and LGBT-friendly venue in the city.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most of the book is already researched and is 90% written. A short trip to Paris in late 2012 is planned to finish up with the listings. Once fully written (January 2013), I will be approaching literary agents in the attempt to secure a publisher. As a former editor at national newsmagazines (including The Advocate), I have several resources in this area. If all else fails, I will be self-publishing the guide. Funds raised will be used primarily for the publisher search and revision process or self-publishing costs.</p>
</div></div>","There are hundreds of travel guide to Paris, but virtually none even mention the city's incredibly rich lesbian and gay culture. I'm specifically reaching out to gay and lesbian visitors to Gay Par-ee, those same-sex-loving travelers who want to learn a little bit more about the role of LGBT men and women in Paris’s incredible history or spend time mixing and mingling with the city’s large, diverse and incredibly welcoming gay community, be it for just a few hours or for your entire Parisian stay. No other city in Europe—and possibly in the entire world—has as large and active a gay community that is supported by as many LGBT-owned or LGBT-friendly businesses as does Paris. There are more than two dozen (yup, two dozen!) gay bars in the city; 25 gay cafes and restaurants, and another dozen-plus that advertise as being gay-friendly; countless gay shops and boutiques; and more than 100 LGBT organizations, including social and cultural groups, athletic leagues, health and support associations and sexual/fetish organizations. And did you know that there are numerous gay and lesbian connections to some of the city’s most popular sightseeing destinations, like Place des Vosges, Pere Lachaise Cemetery and the literary Left Bank? Or that there were (at least) two French kings who preferred the company of men? Of course you didn't, because other Paris travel guides never mention such things. I do! So, if you're a gay person heading to the City of Light and you want some tips on where to learn about YOUR culture and mingle with YOUR people, this guide is a must-have.

We are a grassroots community arts organization providing creative programming, mentoring, and performance opportunities for youth in the Long Beach area. Although our approaches to creating are as diverse as our backgrounds, it is the spirit and passion behind our art that unites. Simply, we want to empower and enable the youth in our beloved community with the creative tools they need to become unstoppable leaders and agents for change.


In July 2012, we hope to send a group of talented, committed youth to the Brave New Voices International Youth Poetry Festival in the San Francisco Bay Area, the largest ongoing spoken word event in the world. BNV brings together young artists, activists, educators, poets, and emerging leaders to participate in a celebration and demonstration of free speech, artistic empowerment, and youth voice.

Every year, hundreds of youth compete on slam teams from the U.S. and Europe at BNV. At the center of the festival is the International Youth Poetry Slam. A poetry slam is a high-energy competition where spoken word poets share meaningful original works that are then ""judged"" by members of the audience. 

However, Brave New Voices also offers numerous community forums, workshops, conferences, and performance events that encourage youth, artists, educators, activists, and community leaders to be advocates and agents for positive change on a local and global scale.



The Impact
Long Beach, California is one of the most culturally and ethnically diverse cities in all the United States. Because of this, the city also has an equally diverse and vibrant arts and cultural scene. Currently, there are dozens of theatre, music, and spoken word venues operating in Long Beach. However, none of them cater specifically to youth. 

Â¡DUENDE! hopes to change this. We envision a Long Beach that values the powerful ideas, talents, and opinions of youth and recognizes their ability to create positive transformation and healing in their communities. 

We believe that spoken word poetry is the perfect artistic medium to enable this vision to become a reality. Spoken word provides a unique opportunity for youth to share their stories and hopes for the future, as a distinct art form that marries music, poetry, theatre, hip hop, and storytelling.

Poetry slams have often been high-octane, dynamic performance events that attract a large audience willing to be inspired and entertained.

By combining youth voices and poetry slams, we know this generation of young people will be the leaders our world needs.



What We Need & What You Get
To participate in BNV, we must raise the $1,000 registration fee as well as the costs to travel from Long Beach to the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently, we have around $250 that we've raised that is used to fund our weekly youth poetry workshops.

<h3><font color=""#339900"">The Story of Us...</font></h3>
<div>    <font color=""#ff0000""><b> <font size=""3"">Phantasmagorium</font></b></font> is the literary and artistic collaboration of four friends: a multi-medium artist, an award-winning author, a <font>talented screenwriter </font>and a part-time designer. Our goal was as a simple one, or so we thought:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><font>     <font color=""#000000"">To create a venue where talented writers and artists in the genre of <b>horror</b> could publish well honed  visionary works of literature and art...</font></font></div>
<div><font><font color=""#000000"">     <b> And </b>be</font><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""> paid more than a pittance for their considerable efforts to extend the boundaries of the genre.</span></font></div>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><br/></span></div>
<div>    <b>Horror </b>has always been an underappreciated medium. For centuries, it has been considered entertainment for the low brow and children. Yet some of the most influential writers and artists of all time created great works of the macabre and grotesque. From<b> Dickinson</b> to <b>Poe</b>, <b>Lovecraft</b> to <b>King</b>, <b>Da Vinci</b>, <b>Dali and Giger;</b> each of these creative geniuses changed the hearts and minds of generations. They did so with the seldom appreciated talent that is needed to craft a believable tale or work that echoes the very basis of the human condition:</div>
<div> ""Life is Pain."" ( the Buddha, <b style="""">SiddhÄrta Gautama)</b>
</div>
</div><div><b style=""""><font color=""#ff0000"" size=""3""><br/></font></b></div><div><font size=""3""><b style=""""><font color=""#ff0000"">   </font></b><span style=""""><font color=""#ff0000""> </font><b><font color=""#ff0000"">Phantasmagorium</font></b><font color=""#000000""> is our attempt to help the current generation of creators to continue to develop the craft and to push the boundaries that is <b>horror</b>.</font></span></font></div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3><font color=""#339900"">Impact!</font></h3>
<p></p>
<p>     We aim to assist these talented people!  To begin with, there are some authors from whom we quickly received, edited, and printed their works.  We paid what we could for their excellent short horror stories and poems -- and it was a decent amount, though we would like to be able to increase our purchasing price.  They were published in our new quarterly journal, Phantasmagorium, in print, ePub, Kindle/Mobi, and PDF format.</p>
<p>     (Specifically for artists, we unfortunately did not have enough available cash to pay an artist to do artwork for the first issue.)</p>
<p>     Phantasmagorium has already been picked up by 3 locations of Powell's bookstores and we will continue to expand that in-person offering.  As well, we sell it on our website in multiple electronic versions that suit any reader's needs.  Within the journal itself, we also link eReaders to the author's websites and use the full back page to advertise those same sites or blogs.  What this does for the authors is gives them more exposure to the reading public.</p>
<p>     Issue #2 comes out this month.  We cut back on the number of stories we accepted because we could not afford to pay the same amount to as many and did not want to pay less.  Printing costs ended up being more than we were originally quoted as the cheapest printer who would work with our short 'run' at a discount folded up shop.  And we had other setbacks (file creation/conversion, website issues, etc.) that have tried to keep us down...</p>
<p>     But we do not give up!  There are too many who need their awesome works to be seen and read, and ALSO to survive off of it. <font color=""#330099""> It is not not our 'work', but a mission.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p>     This project has also brought to light other ways that <span style=""color: rgb(204, 0, 102); font-size: medium;"">Gorgon Press</span> can help authors get paid, published, and recognized.  But we can't start toward those goals until we have solidified Phantasmagorium.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3><font color=""#339900"">What We Need... And What You Get</font></h3>
<p>     We have set the goal for this campaign at $2500.  The MOST important things that it will do is:</p>
<p>* help us pay off the unexpected printer that we had to buy, after the only affordable printing company we could find closed<br/></p>
<p>* hopefully eventually allow us to print 'in bulk', which is the <u>best</u> way to keep the print version affordable</p>
<p>* provide us with a little bit of an advertising budget, instead of relying solely on social media and word-of-mouth</p>
<p>* as well, we'll be able to pay artists for cover designs instead of always relying on our poor overworked Publisher, JD</p>
<p>* and, of course, help us be able to pay a fairer wage without having to charge more for the end-products</p>
<p>     How does helping us help you?  Well, luckily we have tangible products!  Depending upon your generosity, we are able to send you electronic or print copies of the fruits of so many people's labors, and some autographed.  That is how we can thank you directly.</p>
<p>     As well, we are <b><font color=""#330099"">big</font></b> fans of the 'local' movement.  But one of the few (and most important) things that expands beyond local economies is the written word.  So we do not hesitate to publish great work, no matter where it originated.</p>
<p>     IndieGoGo is a ""crowdfunding"" website that helps artists and entrepreneurs get their projects and small businesses off the ground.  It has received national press from Good Morning America, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, PBS and more.  They offer us online resources to promote our start-up and allow us to collect donation (as small as $10) from gracious people like you through a safe and popular payment method (PayPal).  However, we must reach our financial goal in a limited number of days.  Our campaign will end on Feb 23, 2012.  We have lots of plans, so please check back often for updates on our goal and Issue #2!  You can also find us at<font style=""font-size: small;""><font color=""#006666""> </font><span style=""font-weight: 800;""><a href=""http://www.phantasmagorium.co/wordpress"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Phantasmagorium""><font color=""#000000"">www.phantasmagorium.co/wordpress</font></a></span><font color=""#006666""> </font></font>or <b style=""font-size: small;""><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/groups/271132339566544/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-size: small;"" target=""_blank"" title=""Phanta on Facebook""><font color=""#000000"">www.facebook.com/groups/271132339566544/</font></a></b><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;"">.</span></p>
<p>     Because these are each small goals on their own, <span style=""color: rgb(204, 0, 102); font-size: medium;"">Gorgon Press</span> will be able to apply all assistance you give toward easy goals that improve the livelihoods of these talented people!  We might end up starting a separate campaign for an actual 'item' in the near future, which would enable us to attend the many Cons that would help spread the word... but for now, this is an excellent start!</p>

</div></div>","The Story of Us...
     Phantasmagorium is the literary and artistic collaboration of four friends: a multi-medium artist, an award-winning author, a talented screenwriter and a part-time designer. Our goal was as a simple one, or so we thought:

     To create a venue where talented writers and artists in the genre of horror could publish well honed  visionary works of literature and art...
      And be paid more than a pittance for their considerable efforts to extend the boundaries of the genre.

    Horror has always been an underappreciated medium. For centuries, it has been considered entertainment for the low brow and children. Yet some of the most influential writers and artists of all time created great works of the macabre and grotesque. From Dickinson to Poe, Lovecraft to King, Da Vinci, Dali and Giger; each of these creative geniuses changed the hearts and minds of generations. They did so with the seldom appreciated talent that is needed to craft a believable tale or work that echoes the very basis of the human condition:
 ""Life is Pain."" ( the Buddha, SiddhÄrta Gautama)

    Phantasmagorium is our attempt to help the current generation of creators to continue to develop the craft and to push the boundaries that is horror.
Impact!

     We aim to assist these talented people!  To begin with, there are some authors from whom we quickly received, edited, and printed their works.  We paid what we could for their excellent short horror stories and poems -- and it was a decent amount, though we would like to be able to increase our purchasing price.  They were published in our new quarterly journal, Phantasmagorium, in print, ePub, Kindle/Mobi, and PDF format.
     (Specifically for artists, we unfortunately did not have enough available cash to pay an artist to do artwork for the first issue.)
     Phantasmagorium has already been picked up by 3 locations of Powell's bookstores and we will continue to expand that in-person offering.  As well, we sell it on our website in multiple electronic versions that suit any reader's needs.  Within the journal itself, we also link eReaders to the author's websites and use the full back page to advertise those same sites or blogs.  What this does for the authors is gives them more exposure to the reading public.
     Issue #2 comes out this month.  We cut back on the number of stories we accepted because we could not afford to pay the same amount to as many and did not want to pay less.  Printing costs ended up being more than we were originally quoted as the cheapest printer who would work with our short 'run' at a discount folded up shop.  And we had other setbacks (file creation/conversion, website issues, etc.) that have tried to keep us down...
     But we do not give up!  There are too many who need their awesome works to be seen and read, and ALSO to survive off of it.  It is not not our 'work', but a mission.

     This project has also brought to light other ways that Gorgon Press can help authors get paid, published, and recognized.  But we can't start toward those goals until we have solidified Phantasmagorium.


What We Need... And What You Get
     We have set the goal for this campaign at $2500.  The MOST important things that it will do is:
* help us pay off the unexpected printer that we had to buy, after the only affordable printing company we could find closed
* hopefully eventually allow us to print 'in bulk', which is the best way to keep the print version affordable
* provide us with a little bit of an advertising budget, instead of relying solely on social media and word-of-mouth
* as well, we'll be able to pay artists for cover designs instead of always relying on our poor overworked Publisher, JD
* and, of course, help us be able to pay a fairer wage without having to charge more for the end-products
     How does helping us help you?  Well, luckily we have tangible products!  Depending upon your generosity, we are able to send you electronic or print copies of the fruits of so many people's labors, and some autographed.  That is how we can thank you directly.
     As well, we are big fans of the 'local' movement.  But one of the few (and most important) things that expands beyond local economies is the written word.  So we do not hesitate to publish great work, no matter where it originated.
     IndieGoGo is a ""crowdfunding"" website that helps artists and entrepreneurs get their projects and small businesses off the ground.  It has received national press from Good Morning America, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, PBS and more.  They offer us online resources to promote our start-up and allow us to collect donation (as small as $10) from gracious people like you through a safe and popular payment method (PayPal).  However, we must reach our financial goal in a limited number of days.  Our campaign will end on Feb 23, 2012.  We have lots of plans, so please check back often for updates on our goal and Issue #2!  You can also find us at www.phantasmagorium.co/wordpress or www.facebook.com/groups/271132339566544/.
     Because these are each small goals on their own, Gorgon Press will be able to apply all assistance you give toward easy goals that improve the livelihoods of these talented people!  We might end up starting a separate campaign for an actual 'item' in the near future, which would enable us to attend the many Cons that would help spread the word... but for now, this is an excellent start!


Please!  Other Ways You Can Help Our Mission!
   We appreciate your interest in our fledgling projects!  We encourage you to make yourself known to us so that we may update you as we progress and near completion on Issue #2, as well as assist us in getting the word out!  While Gorgon Press is based in the US, we have already published 2 authors living overseas in Phantasmagorium and enjoy spreading the 'horror' to as many people in as many ways as possible.  Many thanks for any sharing that you do of our campaign and cause.  And no matter what... support your favorite authors and artists!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My nonfiction book entitled <em>The Great Fairy Tales of Christianity: The Negative Impact of Religion In The Black Community </em>is a completed manuscript, which I'd like to publish under my own publishing label, New Revolution Publications. I'm asking for minimum funding in the amount of $2,501 to get started with publishing my book. As a publisher, I would use the services of Lightning Source, which is a publishing company that specializes in print-on-demand, trade paperback and hardback, color books, binding, photography, indexing, illustration, marketing, distribution, digital cover, and digital bookblock. Therefore, all funding that I receive from generous donors would be used for printing, binding, photography, indexing, illustration, marketing, distribution, digital cover, and digital bookblock. I would also use the money for travel/lodging expenses incurred on a promotional tour for my book. T<em>he Great Fairy Tales of Christianity: The Negative Impact of Religion In The Black Community i</em>s a project that I am most proud of because it is my own personal account of how I transitioned from Christianity to atheism. It is also an honest discussion on the negative impact that religious systems have on the world, and how organized religion account for much of the world's miseries today, including much of the problems that exist in Black America. Because I grew up in a predominantly religious community and was indoctrinated in the Christian faith, it was devastatingly painful to realize that I was raised to believe in an ancient fairy tale. Therefore, I decided to write about my own personal journey from spiritual enslavement to enlightenment.</p>
<p><em>The Great Fairy Tales of Christianity: The Negative Impact of Religion In The Black Community</em> is a comprehensive subject that tackles a controversial issue on whether organized religion is outdated and whether the bible is to be rendered obsolete. The great fairy tales passed on from generation to generation by primitive-thinking folk have no place in the age of science and reasoning. My book questions whether religious faith is still relevant as we homo sapiens continue to progress in the age of modern technology.</p>
<p>My creative writing journey began at the age of thirteen with essay writing. I later taught myself how to write short stories and poetry. In addition to writing and publishing my debut novel entitled <em>The Evil Within Him</em>in 2007, I've published a short story collection entitled <em>Vanished and Other Short Stories </em>in 2002. I’ve also published <em>Matters of the Heart: A Collection of Short Stories, Poetry &amp; Creative Nonfiction</em> in 2004. My current project is important, because it is a my discourse on the psychological trauma associated with religious indoctrination and how dangerous it is to expose children to religious belief systems before they are mentally mature enough to make informed decisions on what they will choose to believe and not believe. </p>
<p>My nonfiction book will be the first published work under New Revolution Publications. Since I already have an account with Lightning Source, I will simply submit my completed manuscript to the company, which will then create a file, generate color template, scan for title submission standards, create a digital cover and digital bookblock, and determine the weight and spine width of my book. The finished project will be a fantastic nonfiction work with a great cover that Lightning Source will first get approved through me prior to printing my book.</p>
<p>I am asking for a minimum of $2,501 in funding to get my project started. The funds will be used for initial publishing costs associated with printing, digital cover, digital bookblock, general color template, binding, illustration, indexing, and photography. The funds will also cover the costs associated with distribution, advertisement, travel/lodging, and the purchase of a quantity of books that I will sell at book signing events. If I overfund my project, I will use the extra money to publish my completed manuscript entitled <em>American Essays On Popular Culture</em>. </p>

<p>Since 2001, The United States has sent over two million of its men and women, young and old, to war.  They have borne witness to war without fronts, combat without respite, and ever-changing distinctions between enemy and ally.  They have borne witness to history.</p>

<h3><em><strong>**For every book pre-ordered, $1 will be donated to National Mill Dog Rescue.**</strong></em></h3>
<h3>What Is This About?</h3>
<p>I know puppy mills are evil. You know puppy mills are evil. It's time the whole world knows!</p>
<p>I am the creator (photographer &amp; author) of <a href=""http://www.thephotobooks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Photo Book Projects</a>, a series of photo books designed to raise awareness about misunderstood and mistreated dogs. The first books were Deaf Dogs (my dog was born deaf), Rescued in America (on rescued dogs) and Pit Bulls &amp; Pit Bull Type Dogs.</p>
<p><strong>This book, Puppy Mill Survivors, will be the fourth book in the series and it is the most important.</strong> It is 2013 and still puppies are being bred in commercial puppy mills around the country. These dogs have very few rights legally. Many live in isolation, with no exercise, inadequate food, no veterinary care, no socialization, no emotional care and no playtime. Many have never been walked. Some live in cages so small that they can't even stand up straight. The wire-floor cages they are forced to stand on tear up the pads of their feet. The females are bred too frequently and their health suffers because of it. Once the breeder dogs are too old to be profitable to the mills' owners, they are disposed of, either killed or dropped off at a kill shelter.</p>
<p>This needs to change! This book will educate people about these mills and help people learn that they should NEVER buy a puppy from a pet store or an online breeder whose physical site they have never visted. More than 90% of dogs in pet stores are from puppy mills, and many online puppy sites get the dogs they sell from puppy mills, too, even when they say they don't. I want this book to get national press. It is time that things change for these dogs. Things NEED to change for these dogs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where Does the Money Go? What if We Don't Raise the Full Amount?</h3>
<p>I produce high-quality photo books that are printed in the U.S. The books are FSC-certified and Rainforest Alliance certified. A percentage of the proceeds from book sales is donated to rescues around the country.</p>
<p>If all of the printing money is raised, the Puppy Mill book will be approximately 140-160 pages and will contain the stories and photos of 50 former puppy mill dogs who have now found their forever homes. THIS WILL NOT BE A SAD BOOK. This book will be full of HEARTWARMING stories of adorable dogs who have overcome the odds and found the perfect loving home they always deserved.</p>
<p>This is the FINAL ATTEMPT to raise this money. If the money isn't raised then the books will be printed online using a digital printing site such as blurb.com.  I won't be able to sell the book in bookstores or on my website. In short, if the money isn't raised, this book won't have as big of an impact because we won't be able to get press coverage and not as many people will find and see the book.</p>
<p>So WE NEED TO RAISE THE MONEY to get these books printed ourselves in order for the book to have the impact it needs to have...in order for the dogs to get the help they need and deserve.</p>
</div>
<div>

So WE NEED TO RAISE THE MONEY to get these books printed ourselves in order for the book to have the impact it needs to have...in order for the dogs to get the help they need and deserve.


What Do You Get for Your Contribution?


For $15 you get: A SIGNED copy of  ""Don't forget me. Stop Puppy Mills"" open edition print. This INCLUDES shipping (see high contribution amounts for Canadian & Worldwide shipping addresses)
 

For $35 you get: A SIGNED COPY of the Puppy Mill Survivors photo book (U.S. shipping only - see higher contributions amounts for Canadian & Worldwide shipping addresses). Check out the other contribution levels to get multiple copies of the Puppy Mill Survivors book.
 

For $125 you get: SIGNED COPIES of all 4 of my books: 1 copy each of Deaf Dogs, Rescued in America, Pit Bulls & Pit Bull Type Dogs AND Puppy Mill Survivors...all SIGNED! (U.S. shipping only - see higher contribution amounts for Canadian & Worldwide shipping addresses).

The Impact & Donations to National Mill Dog Rescue
I raised enough money to print the Pit Bulls & Pit Bull Type Dogs photo book using Kickstarter.com. We can certainly raise enough here to get the Puppy Mill book printed! Let's do this!
PLUS, for every book pre-ordered, I will donate $1 to National Mill Dog Rescue.


Other Ways You Can Help
This is just ONE way I am raising the total printing costs of $30,000! I am also offering...
Sponsorships & Dedications: Get your name, your business' name and website, or a dedication to your dog listed at the back of the Puppy Mill photo book. The cost is just $25. Click here to sponsor!
Fun & Cool Pop Art Artwork: Pop Art prints made from photos of YOUR pet that you email to us. We create pop art graphics, AND showcase these images on our website. You get a print of your pop art and get to show off your dog on our website. For slightly more you can get your own dog's story added to the site! On our site, there is a general page for all dogs, and pages showcasing Rescued Dogs, Deaf Dogs, Pit Bull Type Dogs and even a page for Rescued Cats! Click here to get a graphic made of your dog!
TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW! Indiegogo also has tools for you to share this project with your friends! Help spread the word on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and email!

</h3> <p>Greetings! Thank you for your uncontrollable desire to learn more about these Africans in Greek Mythology :)... We couldn't resist these stories either. We are a team of entrepreneurs that create new and innovative ways for children to learn history and culture. Our creative juices started rolling in when we discovered Homer's ""blameless Ethiopians"" or what we call Africans today. We feel this story introduces one very important theme to children; historical perspectives. There are many negative things presented to us at a very young age concerning the ""dark continent"" and these Africans in Greek Mythology challenge this limited worldview. What better story to tell! It is unique and new! First of its kind.</p>
<p>With your help we will pioneer a new age concerning historical perspectives and highlight diversity. The beautiful illustrations of Africans will certainly be one of a kind; truly a rare site seen throughout popular culture. The book will be written in poetic and romantic style that will leave the reader desiring to learn more about these people. Stories like these are important to our children as it helps them embrace our diverse society.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>Sparked</i> is a framework I created to guide young adults to recognize and reach their own true potential. Emphasis on “their own"" free of the external opinions of others.<br/><br/>My name is Fatimah Ibidunni and I am the author of <i>Sparked</i>. I wrote this book because, as someone who struggled with finding myself, I was unsuccessful in my search for a guide that clearly laid out the path for me and made it clear that my vision for myself was possible. I continually compared myself to others and molded myself into what I believed I should be, overlooking who I already was.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your true self and be proud of that person and their potential. In this book, I hope to change the narrative that becoming a man or woman of excellence is only limited to a select few. I want every reader to see this book as a tool to help you create the life that you envision for yourself. One that is free of any external opinions or comparisons, with the focus being entirely on who you know yourself to be.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about personal development and finding your spark:<ul>
<li>In a vulnerable interview from Tatiana Elizabeth a model and beauty influencer, she speaks about her path where you will learn the importance of recognizing and believing in your gifts.</li>
<li>From actor and comedian Yvonne Orji about her unconventional path to Hollywood which required her to defy her parents to follow a spark in her life.</li>
<li>Through stories from my own life and other young millennials who are striving to make their mark on this world while staying true to who they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you have struggled to find what that special thing is that you have to offer this world. If you already know what it is and need guidance, this is also the book for you. It was written to encourage young adults and serve as a guide to becoming the person you envision yourself to be. The trick is simply keeping your eyes open for sparks, trusting your intuition, and focusing on your interests and traits that are unique to you.<br/><br/><i>Sparked</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to young millennials and adults alike who are looking at self-discovery and guidance for the first time when it comes to putting themselves first as they move through life’s rollercoaster. <i>Sparked</i> is to encourage young adults to free themselves from the external noise and focus on putting themselves first in life’s pursuits.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Sparked</h3> The book is written in 5 Parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the Introduction + Chapters 1-3. In this section, you will learn about <strong>The Toxic Mindset.</strong> Here, I outline what has led me and many others to our lowest points of doubt and what can be done to pull ourselves out.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 4-6. In this section, you will learn about <strong>Getting in the Game</strong>. We will dive into the important steps involved in building up your self-confidence and worth. Included here are stories from influential women on the lessons they have learned that ultimately will prepare you for the journey ahead.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 7-9. Here the topic of Sparks is introduced. Put simply sparks are just another word for interests. This chapter will introduce my theory on how <strong>Finding Your Spark </strong>is a necessary piece of the puzzle in your journey.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains Chapters 10-13. In this section, it is <strong>Time To Get Serious</strong>. At this point, you should be fired up about your potential. We are going to go over what you need to do next to put everything together. Many stories are included in this section from my own stories, to those of young millennials and influential icons.<br/><br/>Part 5 contains Chapters 14-18. Finally, it’s all about <strong>The Highway To Success</strong>. This section is to get you prepared for what is next once you have locked your sights on the future you plan to create for yourself.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>

<h3>Resumen</h3> <p>Soy Alberto López Calvo, más conocido como <strong>Claalc </strong>en Internet, fundador de Taller Skywalker, miembro de The Force Group, presentador del podcast de la Biblioteca del Templo Jedi y colaborador de Cificom. Toda la vida me ha encantado escribir, sobre todo relatos y novelas fanfiction. De hecho, mi primera novela, desarrollada cuando tan solo tenía 9 años, tomaba como protagonista a Indiana Jones. Años después, publiqué, bajo el sello de UNO Editorial, una obra de James Bond titulada <i>007: Libertad para Vengarse </i>con notable éxito de ventas, dado que no solo recuperé lo invertido sino que, además, obtuve algunos beneficios y muy buenas críticas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ahora, pretendo repetir la operación con esta novela de Star Wars que escribí hace algunos años. Claro que para eso requiero de tu colaboración, a cambio de la cual obtendrás un ejemplar de la obra. El libro incluye, además, <strong>25 relatos cortos</strong> de mi cosecha -ambientados tanto en la Trilogía Clásica como en la de las Precuelas- y su propio marcapáginas. </p> <h3>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</h3> <p>Únicamente necesito 728€. Con este dinero cubriría todos los gastos, que son los siguientes:</p> <ul>
<li>640€ = coste de la impresión de la tirada de 50 ejemplares </li>
<li>32€ = coste del uso de esta página de crowdfounding</li>
<li>56€ = coste de las transferencias bancarias</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>A cambio de tu <strong>aportación de</strong> <strong>25€</strong>, tienes derecho a:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>1 Novela ""Star Wars: Misión Fortuita""</li>
<li>25 relatos cortos de Star Wars</li>
<li>1 Marcapáginas</li>
<li>1 Novela ""Star Wars: Misión Fortuita"" en formato Word y PDF</li>
<li>25 relatos cortos de Star Wars en formato Word y PDF</li>
<li>Gastos de envío incluidos (por correo ordinario, no certificado, y solo península ibérica)</li>
</ul>
</div><p> </p><p>En caso de que no se logre alcanzar la meta total, tomaré una de estas dos decisiones:</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>Si alcanzo al menos el 80% de la meta, seguiré adelante, es decir, pondré el resto del dinero de mi bolsillo, de modo que trataré de conseguir el resto por medio de la venta posterior de la obra.</li>
<li>Si no alcanzo el 80% de la meta, utilizaré el dinero para lanzar una tirada de 25 ejemplares, cuyo coste de fabricación es de 542 euros.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>Dado que faltaría que la imprenta maquete tanto la obra como los relatos cortos, al estar en formato Word en formato A4, al tamaño clásico de 15x21 cm, he calculado que rondará las 350 páginas. Contará con encuadernación rústica fresada (tapas blandas) e incluirá solapas y marcapáginas. La portada irá en papel estucado mate de 300 gramos, mientras que el resto constará de papel offset ahuesado de 90 gramos.</p><div> <h3>El impacto</h3> <p>Dado que tanto la novela como los 25 relatos cortos siempre han gustado mucho en todos los sitios y foros de Internet en los que los he publicado, pienso que merecen tener una versión física. Así se podrán disfrutar de una mejor manera que delante de una pantalla. Al mismo tiempo, me permitiría obtener un mayor reconocimiento porque bien es sabido que se tiende a infravalorar lo digital y lo gratuito.</p>
<p>Lo digo por experiencia propia. Nunca se tuvo en cuenta mi colección de 20 relatos cortos de James Bond o la citada novela <i>007: Libertad para Vengarse</i> hasta que publiqué el conjunto de todo ello en un ejemplar físico. ¡Incluso fui entrevistado por<i> La Nueva España</i>, el periódico de mayor tirada de Asturias, ahí es nada!</p> <h3>Riesgos y desafíos</h3> <p>Dado que tanto la novela como los 25 relatos cortos ya están escritos, el único riesgo reside en la financiación. Como expliqué en un apartado anterior, el plan B pasa por contratar una tirada de 25 ejemplares en vez de una de 50 en caso de que no alcance el 80% de la meta.</p>
</div><div> <h3>Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar</h3> <p>Compartiendo esta compaña a través de la herramientas propias de Indiegogo o cualquier red social, foro, página, etc. Con especial atención, claro, a aquellas relacionadas con Star Wars.</p>

El libro incluye, además, 25 relatos cortos de mi cosecha -ambientados tanto en la Trilogía Clásica como en la de las Precuelas- y su propio marcapáginas.  Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes Únicamente necesito 728€. Con este dinero cubriría todos los gastos, que son los siguientes: 
640€ = coste de la impresión de la tirada de 50 ejemplares 
32€ = coste del uso de esta página de crowdfounding
56€ = coste de las transferencias bancarias

 
A cambio de tu aportación de 25€, tienes derecho a:
 

1 Novela ""Star Wars: Misión Fortuita""
25 relatos cortos de Star Wars
1 Marcapáginas
1 Novela ""Star Wars: Misión Fortuita"" en formato Word y PDF
25 relatos cortos de Star Wars en formato Word y PDF
Gastos de envío incluidos (por correo ordinario, no certificado, y solo península ibérica)

 En caso de que no se logre alcanzar la meta total, tomaré una de estas dos decisiones: 
Si alcanzo al menos el 80% de la meta, seguiré adelante, es decir, pondré el resto del dinero de mi bolsillo, de modo que trataré de conseguir el resto por medio de la venta posterior de la obra.
Si no alcanzo el 80% de la meta, utilizaré el dinero para lanzar una tirada de 25 ejemplares, cuyo coste de fabricación es de 542 euros.
 Dado que faltaría que la imprenta maquete tanto la obra como los relatos cortos, al estar en formato Word en formato A4, al tamaño clásico de 15x21 cm, he calculado que rondará las 350 páginas. Contará con encuadernación rústica fresada (tapas blandas) e incluirá solapas y marcapáginas. La portada irá en papel estucado mate de 300 gramos, mientras que el resto constará de papel offset ahuesado de 90 gramos. El impacto Dado que tanto la novela como los 25 relatos cortos siempre han gustado mucho en todos los sitios y foros de Internet en los que los he publicado, pienso que merecen tener una versión física. Así se podrán disfrutar de una mejor manera que delante de una pantalla. Al mismo tiempo, me permitiría obtener un mayor reconocimiento porque bien es sabido que se tiende a infravalorar lo digital y lo gratuito.
Lo digo por experiencia propia. Nunca se tuvo en cuenta mi colección de 20 relatos cortos de James Bond o la citada novela 007: Libertad para Vengarse hasta que publiqué el conjunto de todo ello en un ejemplar físico. ¡Incluso fui entrevistado por La Nueva España, el periódico de mayor tirada de Asturias, ahí es nada! Riesgos y desafíos Dado que tanto la novela como los 25 relatos cortos ya están escritos, el único riesgo reside en la financiación. Como expliqué en un apartado anterior, el plan B pasa por contratar una tirada de 25 ejemplares en vez de una de 50 en caso de que no alcance el 80% de la meta.

Read the book's PrefaceSTEP 2. Keep reading. The Be You Be Sure Project (a.k.a. BYBS!) is a mixed-media publishing venture on a mission to help millennials discover and pursue their convictions. We're here to encourage the search young people take to find out who they are and what they believe in. Our ultimate goal is to promote liberty through self-discovery. We want to make our readers feel good about who they are and where they're at, while offering tools (never taught in school) to help them decide for themselves the best way to move forward in their lives. We believe this process can help heal our planet. 
The millennial movement of young adults on a quest to find their purpose is already happening.

Who am I? 

What should I do? 
Perhaps no two questions haunt modern emerging adults more (and certainly some more than others). Yet, these two questions have inspired our entire campaign.  “There is only one success – to be able to spend life in your own way.” - Christopher Morley WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR?Emerging adults. 20-somethings. Kidults. Members of Generation Screwed. The infamous millennials, who may seem from the outside like drifters who won't grow up and can't commit. This book is for all the people who want to better understand us, too. If you’re someone who believes that maximizing profits is the only North Star, that confusion is life's only constant, that you must look around at other people to figure out who you are and what to do  – than this is not your book.This book is a crash-course through America for the young people who want to take the jump to test their dreams, because now is the time to do it. Our book is for the 83 percent of 20-somethings who know this decade in life is full of change, and the 86 percent who crave careers with meaning. We are an ode to the many millennials out there who are choosing to live their truth in the face of uncertainty. Our founders started this project to address the widely documented rates of anxiety, depression, and feelings of worthlessness currently afflicting young adults worldwide due to disheartening economic realities. It is our hope to inspire; to energize young people to hold tightly to their virtues, despite the disappointment, rejection, sadness, and trauma that are a part of life. We are building empathy by humanizing the life experiences of the people in our diverse generation. We are fuel to keep you banging on the door of opportunity, until someone lets you inside the damn gate. WHAT MAKES OUR PROJECT DIFFERENT?There are a ton of books on how to come-of-age in post-industrial America. Really, there are a ton. We’re different. We’re not going to tell you to define the value of your life based on how quickly you get married, buy a house, make babies, and land a job that earns you a spot in the upper middle class. Yes, all these things are lovely. They are what most people ultimately desire. However, due to economic and political forces outside of our control like: debt, inflation, unemployment, and staggering income inequality, the reality of many millennials resides far from this picture-perfect scenario. So much so that 50 percent of 25 to 32-year-olds see this 'American Dream' as fading. Our book is the missing voice willing to celebrate this shift in social norms. We recognize that depending on luck, biology, your capitalist-imposed lot in life, and what you feel called to do as a career, you may never get the proposal by age 30, or the mortgage you can't afford, or the kids – and this shouldn’t constitute failing if it was the outcome of self-understanding and a steady stream of conscious decision-making. Our book is for the outliers, as well as those who want a conventional life. We've interviewed bankers, homeless people, lobbyists, artists, law school students, non-profit workers, plus size models, farmers, nurses, plus many others to create the most comprehensive guide through your twenties MADE BY 20-SOMETHINGS that exists in the market today. This is a book people of all ages can learn from. The millennials are throwing away traditional notions of success. We, along with a growing number of Americans, know there is no linear track toward true wealth and wellness. REWARDSOUR VISION A country where people are personally liberated to live the life they choose, where diversity and variance is embraced; a place where free will and creativity is more fully realized to implement solutions and cooperatively transform the structure of our society to be more caring, more sustainable, and more beneficial for more of its participants.We believe your twenties are the perfect time to pursue self-realization, and that doing so is essential for the future of this planet.  We need more intentional members of society if we are going to rise to solve its most pressing issues.Across the board, it is the goal of emerging adults everywhere to live a better life than their parents.

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b style=""font-size: 30px; line-height: 38px;"">3594 Miles là ai?</b><br/></p>
<p>Chúng tôi là ba người bạn cấp III
từ Việt Nam: Rio Lam, Zi Nguyen, và Iris Le. Hiện tại chúng tôi đang học Đại học ở Mỹ, và theo đuổi
những mục tiêu khác nhau: Rio tiếp tục con đường viết lách từ khi ở Việt Nam,
Zi hiện đang hoạt động trong lĩnh vực Nhiếp ảnh thời trang; và Iris hướng đến mục
tiêu trở thành thành viên của các tổ chức nhân đạo phi chính phủ.</p>
<p>Tháng 11, 2012 chúng tôi quyết định
sẽ viết và chụp lại cuộc sống nước Mỹ dưới con mắt của ba cô gái Việt Nam sống
xa nhà, và đặt tên quyển sách là “Get Lost. Be Found.” Để thực hiện mục tiêu
đó, chúng tôi đặt ra tên nhóm 3594 Miles, tượng trưng cho quãng đường lái xe từ
bờ Tây đến bờ Đông nước Mỹ, tượng trưng cho tuổi 21 mà chúng tôi đã trải qua
vào năm 2012 – khi chúng tôi quyết định sẽ ghi chép lại quãng thời gian thanh
xuân ở Mỹ của mình. Tương tự như những du học sinh khác, chúng tôi đã cùng
trải qua những buồn vui, những lần được chào đón và những khi bị đặt ra bên lề;
những lúc ngao du trên những cung đường bất tận và những
khi cả tuần chỉ sống bằng mì gói, những cú shock văn hóa lạ lẫm lẫn những lúc
thấu hiểu chính mình, nhận ra mình muốn trở thành ai và muốn làm gì.</p>
<p>Tất cả những trải nghiệm, những cảm xúc đó; chúng tôi sẽ kể lại trong ""Get Lost. Be Found.""</p>

<h2><b>Tại sao là “Get Lost. Be Found.”?</b></h2>
<p>“Get Lost. Be Found.” là tập hợp
những bài viết và ảnh về những sự kiện đã xảy ra trong cuộc sống du học sinh của
chúng tôi, đặc biệt là những chuyến đi vòng quanh nước Mỹ. Quyển sách sẽ được trình bày bằng tiếng Anh và tiếng Việt, xuất bản dưới dạng ebook download miễn phí như món quà tri ân dành cho những
điều tốt đẹp, những người đã ở bên cạnh chúng tôi, dành cho hai đất nước đã giúp
chúng tôi tìm ra ước mơ và đam mê của bản thân mình. Bên cạnh đó, chúng tôi đồng
thời sẽ xuất bản “Get Lost. Be Found.” dưới dạng sách in như quà tặng đặc biệt
dành cho những người ủng hộ.</p>
<p>Khi chúng tôi nhận ra rằng thời
gian ở Mỹ của chúng tôi có hạn, 3594 Miles đã lên kế hoạch đặt chân đến thật
nhiều nơi, từ những thành phố lớn đến những thị trấn nhỏ xưa cũ, từ những công
viên quốc gia đến những vùng đất vỏn vẹn 50 người dân. Những chuyến hành trình
đã mang lại cho chúng tôi nhiều bài học: làm sao để thay bánh xe giữa đường cao
tốc không một bóng người, ngủ qua đêm trong xe giữa rest area hoang vắng vốn
dành cho giới lái xe tải đường dài, ăn mì gói trong cửa hàng tiện lợi hiếm hoi
nằm trên cung đường sa mạc đến Grand Canyon. Chúng tôi đã gặp những con người
thú vị; những người chỉ có thể gặp một lần khi họ dừng chân hỏi chúng tôi cần
giúp gì, những bạn bè ở khắp mọi nơi sẵn lòng giúp một chỗ ở qua đêm, những sinh viên ở các trường hàng đầu nước Mỹ và những người làm việc 24/7 trong môi trường
nặng nhọc. Họ giúp chúng tôi nhận ra nước Mỹ rộng lớn nhưng nếu cần sẽ tìm được
đúng người vào đúng lúc.</p>
<p>Cuộc sống du học không phải màu hồng, điều này tất cả du học sinh đều biết. Và để đi du lịch, chúng
tôi đã nhận làm rất nhiều công việc khác nhau, có những lúc thức trắng đêm để sửa
ảnh chụp cho khách hàng hay viết bài cho kịp hạn chót; có những ngày trước kì
kiểm tra nhưng chúng tôi vẫn phải đến chỗ làm. Cuộc sống sẽ không là màu hồng
cho bất kỳ ai ở bất kỳ nơi đâu; và chúng tôi – cùng với những người bạn xa nhà
xung quanh mình – đang biến nó thành bức tranh cầu vồng, ở nơi đó niềm vui đứng
cạnh nỗi buồn, thách thức đi cùng cơ hội. </p>
<p>Tháng Mười hai năm nay, chúng tôi
sẽ lái xe vòng quanh nước Mỹ, từ Dallas, TX đến bờ Tây (California) để rồi sang
bờ Đông (New York). Đây sẽ là chuyến hành trình đánh dấu những trang cuối cùng
của “Get Lost. Be Found.” Giáng sinh vốn là dịp quay về nhà đoàn tụ với gia
đình. Chúng tôi – Rio, Zi và Iris – sẽ chọn Giáng sinh để lên đường vòng quanh
nước Mỹ - ngôi nhà thứ hai của mình – cùng với Việt Nam trong tim.</p>

<h2><b>Who is behind 3594 Miles?</b></h2>
<p>We are three high-school friends
from Vietnam: Rio Lam, Zi Nguyen, and Iris Le. We are currently following different paths in the United States: Rio continues with her writing career started in
Vietnam, Zi takes Fashion Photography as her life-time goal, and Iris aims to
work for non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>Back in November 2012, while chilling out at White Rock lake, it came to our mind that we should write and capture the American life in the eyes of us as three Vietnamese girls living away from home. We decided to name that book “Get Lost. Be Found.” as a
symbol for what we have been going through during the time of our youth in the
States. As many other abroad students, we have got a handful of happiness and sadness, wild moments on the road and hard time in everyday life, culture shocks, and, the most precious one- finding out who we are. Thanks
to this big adventure, we learn who we want to be and what we want
to do at a quite early age. </p>
<p>Everything will be told by words
and photos in “Get Lost. Be Found.”</p>

<h2><b>Why “Get Lost. Be Found.”?</b></h2>
<p>“Get Lost. Be Found.” is a collection of journals written in both Vietnamese and English, and photos depicting our life in the States through the
scope of remarkable events, valuable experience, everyday life, and interesting
people; mostly based on our trips around America. The ebook version of
“Get Lost. Be Found.” will be published and uploaded for free as a gift of appreciation towards both good and bad things happening, people who have been here
for us; and two countries which help us to find out our dreams and passions.
Besides, we also publish the hard-copy version of “Get Lost. Be Found.” as a
special gift for those who support us in this project.</p>
<p>At the point we were aware of our possibly limited time in the States, it came to our minds that we should explore as many
places as possible, from big cities to forgotten towns, from national parks to
remote farms. These trips have taught us numerous important lessons: checking
up car, changing flat tires (as girls, it took us quite some time to learn), sleeping
safe and sound in a car parked at a rest area with the heat turned off to
save gas, eating instant noodles with hot water begged from convenient stores
on the way during the whole trip. We have met interesting people: some of them
we only probably saw once in a lifetime for they only stopped to ask if we need
help, friends from everywhere who hosted us, students from top schools, and
workers who work 24/7 in poor conditions. Humans of America help us realize that despite of its vast area, we always can find right people at right times.</p>

<p>Life is not filled of roses for abroad students. Life is never a monochrome canvas for anyone anywhere. Life is a rainbow, an endless and sophisticated spectrum for us to live it up. There were days before important exams we still
had to get up and work. There were nights we had to pull an all-nighter to
edit photos for clients or finish writings before deadline. </p>
<p>And yet those hard days have led
us to new places some of which we even hadn’t thought of. This December, we
will take a road-trip around America, from Dallas, TX to West Coast
(California) then East Coast (New York). We chose Christmas since that is time of the year supposed for people to be at home with family, but here we are, in the United
States and thousands miles away from our families. That will be the time for us
to discover America – our second home – with Vietnam always at hearts. That will be the final journey marking the last pages of “Get Lost. Be Found.” </p>

3594 Miles là ai?
Chúng tôi là ba người bạn cấp III
từ Việt Nam: Rio Lam, Zi Nguyen, và Iris Le. Hiện tại chúng tôi đang học Đại học ở Mỹ, và theo đuổi
những mục tiêu khác nhau: Rio tiếp tục con đường viết lách từ khi ở Việt Nam,
Zi hiện đang hoạt động trong lĩnh vực Nhiếp ảnh thời trang; và Iris hướng đến mục
tiêu trở thành thành viên của các tổ chức nhân đạo phi chính phủ.
Tháng 11, 2012 chúng tôi quyết định
sẽ viết và chụp lại cuộc sống nước Mỹ dưới con mắt của ba cô gái Việt Nam sống
xa nhà, và đặt tên quyển sách là “Get Lost. Be Found.” Để thực hiện mục tiêu
đó, chúng tôi đặt ra tên nhóm 3594 Miles, tượng trưng cho quãng đường lái xe từ
bờ Tây đến bờ Đông nước Mỹ, tượng trưng cho tuổi 21 mà chúng tôi đã trải qua
vào năm 2012 – khi chúng tôi quyết định sẽ ghi chép lại quãng thời gian thanh
xuân ở Mỹ của mình. Tương tự như những du học sinh khác, chúng tôi đã cùng
trải qua những buồn vui, những lần được chào đón và những khi bị đặt ra bên lề;
những lúc ngao du trên những cung đường bất tận và những
khi cả tuần chỉ sống bằng mì gói, những cú shock văn hóa lạ lẫm lẫn những lúc
thấu hiểu chính mình, nhận ra mình muốn trở thành ai và muốn làm gì.
Tất cả những trải nghiệm, những cảm xúc đó; chúng tôi sẽ kể lại trong ""Get Lost. Be Found.""


Waco, TX



Austin, TX

Tại sao là “Get Lost. Be Found.”?
“Get Lost. Be Found.” là tập hợp
những bài viết và ảnh về những sự kiện đã xảy ra trong cuộc sống du học sinh của
chúng tôi, đặc biệt là những chuyến đi vòng quanh nước Mỹ. Quyển sách sẽ được trình bày bằng tiếng Anh và tiếng Việt, xuất bản dưới dạng ebook download miễn phí như món quà tri ân dành cho những
điều tốt đẹp, những người đã ở bên cạnh chúng tôi, dành cho hai đất nước đã giúp
chúng tôi tìm ra ước mơ và đam mê của bản thân mình. Bên cạnh đó, chúng tôi đồng
thời sẽ xuất bản “Get Lost. Be Found.” dưới dạng sách in như quà tặng đặc biệt
dành cho những người ủng hộ.
Khi chúng tôi nhận ra rằng thời
gian ở Mỹ của chúng tôi có hạn, 3594 Miles đã lên kế hoạch đặt chân đến thật
nhiều nơi, từ những thành phố lớn đến những thị trấn nhỏ xưa cũ, từ những công
viên quốc gia đến những vùng đất vỏn vẹn 50 người dân. Những chuyến hành trình
đã mang lại cho chúng tôi nhiều bài học: làm sao để thay bánh xe giữa đường cao
tốc không một bóng người, ngủ qua đêm trong xe giữa rest area hoang vắng vốn
dành cho giới lái xe tải đường dài, ăn mì gói trong cửa hàng tiện lợi hiếm hoi
nằm trên cung đường sa mạc đến Grand Canyon. Chúng tôi đã gặp những con người
thú vị; những người chỉ có thể gặp một lần khi họ dừng chân hỏi chúng tôi cần
giúp gì, những bạn bè ở khắp mọi nơi sẵn lòng giúp một chỗ ở qua đêm, những sinh viên ở các trường hàng đầu nước Mỹ và những người làm việc 24/7 trong môi trường
nặng nhọc. Họ giúp chúng tôi nhận ra nước Mỹ rộng lớn nhưng nếu cần sẽ tìm được
đúng người vào đúng lúc.
Cuộc sống du học không phải màu hồng, điều này tất cả du học sinh đều biết. Và để đi du lịch, chúng
tôi đã nhận làm rất nhiều công việc khác nhau, có những lúc thức trắng đêm để sửa
ảnh chụp cho khách hàng hay viết bài cho kịp hạn chót; có những ngày trước kì
kiểm tra nhưng chúng tôi vẫn phải đến chỗ làm. Cuộc sống sẽ không là màu hồng
cho bất kỳ ai ở bất kỳ nơi đâu; và chúng tôi – cùng với những người bạn xa nhà
xung quanh mình – đang biến nó thành bức tranh cầu vồng, ở nơi đó niềm vui đứng
cạnh nỗi buồn, thách thức đi cùng cơ hội. 
Tháng Mười hai năm nay, chúng tôi
sẽ lái xe vòng quanh nước Mỹ, từ Dallas, TX đến bờ Tây (California) để rồi sang
bờ Đông (New York). Đây sẽ là chuyến hành trình đánh dấu những trang cuối cùng
của “Get Lost. Be Found.” Giáng sinh vốn là dịp quay về nhà đoàn tụ với gia
đình. Chúng tôi – Rio, Zi và Iris – sẽ chọn Giáng sinh để lên đường vòng quanh
nước Mỹ - ngôi nhà thứ hai của mình – cùng với Việt Nam trong tim.

Nam ở Mỹ. 
Với mỗi mức ủng hộ, chúng tôi sẽ
tri ân bằng những phần quà khác nhau, nhưng bản thân “Get Lost. Be Found.”
chính là điều có giá trị nhất mà chúng tôi có thể đem lại cho mọi người – những
người chúng tôi đã và sẽ có cơ duyên được kết nối. Đồng thời, chúng tôi mong mọi
người sẽ cùng chia sẻ thông tin này đến với bạn bè, người thân của mình.

đi cùng chúng tôi trong hành trình này.

Who is behind 3594 Miles?
We are three high-school friends
from Vietnam: Rio Lam, Zi Nguyen, and Iris Le. We are currently following different paths in the United States: Rio continues with her writing career started in
Vietnam, Zi takes Fashion Photography as her life-time goal, and Iris aims to
work for non-profit organizations.
Back in November 2012, while chilling out at White Rock lake, it came to our mind that we should write and capture the American life in the eyes of us as three Vietnamese girls living away from home. We decided to name that book “Get Lost. Be Found.” as a
symbol for what we have been going through during the time of our youth in the
States. As many other abroad students, we have got a handful of happiness and sadness, wild moments on the road and hard time in everyday life, culture shocks, and, the most precious one- finding out who we are. Thanks
to this big adventure, we learn who we want to be and what we want
to do at a quite early age. 
Everything will be told by words
and photos in “Get Lost. Be Found.”

Why “Get Lost. Be Found.”?
“Get Lost. Be Found.” is a collection of journals written in both Vietnamese and English, and photos depicting our life in the States through the
scope of remarkable events, valuable experience, everyday life, and interesting
people; mostly based on our trips around America. The ebook version of
“Get Lost. Be Found.” will be published and uploaded for free as a gift of appreciation towards both good and bad things happening, people who have been here
for us; and two countries which help us to find out our dreams and passions.
Besides, we also publish the hard-copy version of “Get Lost. Be Found.” as a
special gift for those who support us in this project.
At the point we were aware of our possibly limited time in the States, it came to our minds that we should explore as many
places as possible, from big cities to forgotten towns, from national parks to
remote farms. These trips have taught us numerous important lessons: checking
up car, changing flat tires (as girls, it took us quite some time to learn), sleeping
safe and sound in a car parked at a rest area with the heat turned off to
save gas, eating instant noodles with hot water begged from convenient stores
on the way during the whole trip. We have met interesting people: some of them
we only probably saw once in a lifetime for they only stopped to ask if we need
help, friends from everywhere who hosted us, students from top schools, and
workers who work 24/7 in poor conditions. Humans of America help us realize that despite of its vast area, we always can find right people at right times.

Life is not filled of roses for abroad students. Life is never a monochrome canvas for anyone anywhere. Life is a rainbow, an endless and sophisticated spectrum for us to live it up. There were days before important exams we still
had to get up and work. There were nights we had to pull an all-nighter to
edit photos for clients or finish writings before deadline. 
And yet those hard days have led
us to new places some of which we even hadn’t thought of. This December, we
will take a road-trip around America, from Dallas, TX to West Coast
(California) then East Coast (New York). We chose Christmas since that is time of the year supposed for people to be at home with family, but here we are, in the United
States and thousands miles away from our families. That will be the time for us
to discover America – our second home – with Vietnam always at hearts. That will be the final journey marking the last pages of “Get Lost. Be Found.”

<p>«Timothy Kurek, a Portland, Oregon based author and speaker is tackling some of the front burner issues of our day. His unrestrained style of immersion lends a uniquely empathetic perspective, engaging his audiences with empathy, humor, and refreshing candor.<br/><br/>Timothy Kurek, raised within the confines of a strict, conservative Christian denomination in the Bible Belt, Nashville, Tennessee, was taught the gospel of separation from a young age. But it wasn’t long before Timothy’s path and the outside world converged when a friend came out as a lesbian, and revealed she had been excommunicated by her family.<br/><br/>Distraught and overcome with questions and doubts about his religious upbringing, Timothy decided the only way to empathize and understand her pain was to walk in the shoes of very people he had been taught to shun. He decided to come out as a gay man to everyone in his life, and to see for himself how the label of gay would impact his life.<br/><br/>In the tradition of Black Like Me, The Cross in the Closet is a story about people, a story about faith, and about one man’s “abominable” quest to find Jesus in the margins.<br/><br/>Tim is an internationally sought-after speaker and has been featured on ABC's The View, Fox News Alan Colmes, CNN, MSNBC, CTV, HLN, Sirius/XM and dozens of other national and international outlets.»<br/><br/>( From <a href=""http://www.timothykurek.com/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Timothy Kurek's website"">http://www.timothykurek.com/about</a> )</p>

<p><strong>Why Rome?</strong><br/><br/>This campaign is organized by <em>Tassocrazia – La Voce del Tasso</em> (Tassocrazia, the Voice of Tasso), the school newspaper of <em>Liceo Tasso</em> high school in Rome.<br/><br/>As young people, we are most interested in the theme of civil rights, more so since Italy, a mostly Catholic country, is one of the least LGBT-friendly countries in Central Europe, not recognizing same-sex couples and with no specific law against hate crimes towards members of the LGBT community.<br/><br/>We have thus decided that the best way to understand how faith and civil rights are (or can be) interconnected was to invite Mr Kurek as a witness of what discrimination can feel like, and how faith itself does not always equal to discrimination.</p>

<p>«Timothy Kurek è un autore di Portland (Oregon, USA) che sta affrontando uno degli argomenti più scottanti di questi anni. Il suo stile narrativo comporta un'esperienza di totale immersione, stimolando i lettori con empatia, humor, e piacevole candore.<br/><br/>A Timothy Kurek, cresciuto in una congregazione di Cristiani tradizionalisti nella <em>Cintura della Bibbia</em> (Nashville, Tenessee, Stati Uniti del Sud), è stato insegnato fin dalla più tenera età l'Evangelo della separazione, non dell'unità. Ma non c'è voluto molto prima che il destino di Timothy lo facesse scontrare col mondo reale, stringendo amicizia con una giovane lesbica che gli rivelò di essere stata cacciata dalla propria famiglia.<br/><br/>Devastato e assalito da dubbi sulla sua educazione religiosa, Timothy ha deciso che l'unico modo per capire il dolore dell'amica era calzare i panni di quelle stesse persone che gli avevano insegnato a odiare: gli omosessuali. Ha deciso di fare <em>coming out</em> con tutti i suoi conoscenti, e vedere come l'etichetta di ""gay"" avrebbe cambiato la sua vita.<br/><br/>Il libro <em>The Cross in the Closet</em> (non ancora edito in Italia) è una storia di persone, fede, e della scelta “abominevole” di un uomo che ha cercato Gesù fra gli emarginati.<br/><br/>Tim è un nome di fama internazionale ed è stato ospitato da vari canali TV: ABC, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, CTV, HLN, Sirius/XM e dozine di altri canali americani e stranieri.»<br/><br/>( Tradotto da <a href=""http://www.timothykurek.com/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Timothy Kurek's website"">http://www.timothykurek.com/about</a> )</p>
<p> </p>

Who is Timothy Kurek?

«Timothy Kurek, a Portland, Oregon based author and speaker is tackling some of the front burner issues of our day. His unrestrained style of immersion lends a uniquely empathetic perspective, engaging his audiences with empathy, humor, and refreshing candor.Timothy Kurek, raised within the confines of a strict, conservative Christian denomination in the Bible Belt, Nashville, Tennessee, was taught the gospel of separation from a young age. But it wasn’t long before Timothy’s path and the outside world converged when a friend came out as a lesbian, and revealed she had been excommunicated by her family.Distraught and overcome with questions and doubts about his religious upbringing, Timothy decided the only way to empathize and understand her pain was to walk in the shoes of very people he had been taught to shun. He decided to come out as a gay man to everyone in his life, and to see for himself how the label of gay would impact his life.In the tradition of Black Like Me, The Cross in the Closet is a story about people, a story about faith, and about one man’s “abominable” quest to find Jesus in the margins.Tim is an internationally sought-after speaker and has been featured on ABC's The View, Fox News Alan Colmes, CNN, MSNBC, CTV, HLN, Sirius/XM and dozens of other national and international outlets.»( From http://www.timothykurek.com/about )
 
Why Rome?This campaign is organized by Tassocrazia – La Voce del Tasso (Tassocrazia, the Voice of Tasso), the school newspaper of Liceo Tasso high school in Rome.As young people, we are most interested in the theme of civil rights, more so since Italy, a mostly Catholic country, is one of the least LGBT-friendly countries in Central Europe, not recognizing same-sex couples and with no specific law against hate crimes towards members of the LGBT community.We have thus decided that the best way to understand how faith and civil rights are (or can be) interconnected was to invite Mr Kurek as a witness of what discrimination can feel like, and how faith itself does not always equal to discrimination.
 
Who's behind Tassocrazia?Tassocrazia is a mixed-medium (paper/online) newspaper written by Liceo Tasso high school students for their fellow students.We provide information on things happening inside the school, and in the world we live in.Tassocrazia was founded in 2011 by a group of students, and has been wildly recognized both by the school itself, and by the people we have interviewed and who have been our guests as a stable well-balanced project.Simone Ramacci (Section Editor in Chief) and Laura Cardinale (Managing Director) are behind this campaign.Website

Chi è Timothy Kurek?

«Timothy Kurek è un autore di Portland (Oregon, USA) che sta affrontando uno degli argomenti più scottanti di questi anni. Il suo stile narrativo comporta un'esperienza di totale immersione, stimolando i lettori con empatia, humor, e piacevole candore.A Timothy Kurek, cresciuto in una congregazione di Cristiani tradizionalisti nella Cintura della Bibbia (Nashville, Tenessee, Stati Uniti del Sud), è stato insegnato fin dalla più tenera età l'Evangelo della separazione, non dell'unità. Ma non c'è voluto molto prima che il destino di Timothy lo facesse scontrare col mondo reale, stringendo amicizia con una giovane lesbica che gli rivelò di essere stata cacciata dalla propria famiglia.Devastato e assalito da dubbi sulla sua educazione religiosa, Timothy ha deciso che l'unico modo per capire il dolore dell'amica era calzare i panni di quelle stesse persone che gli avevano insegnato a odiare: gli omosessuali. Ha deciso di fare coming out con tutti i suoi conoscenti, e vedere come l'etichetta di ""gay"" avrebbe cambiato la sua vita.Il libro The Cross in the Closet (non ancora edito in Italia) è una storia di persone, fede, e della scelta “abominevole” di un uomo che ha cercato Gesù fra gli emarginati.Tim è un nome di fama internazionale ed è stato ospitato da vari canali TV: ABC, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, CTV, HLN, Sirius/XM e dozine di altri canali americani e stranieri.»( Tradotto da http://www.timothykurek.com/about )

<p>Greetings, fans and supporters of the ASHBATH.COM FRAUDCast!</p>
<p>I, Lester Greystone, will be launching a book tour in order to promote my book, Ugly as HELL.</p>
<p>I will be driving to visit Captain Awesome in Kansas to promote the book.  A MEGASODE will be recorded and aired from there.  I will take 15 copies of my book, Ugly as HELL, and stash them in random locations along the way, and/or give them to random individuals. </p>
<p>Using my patented reverse-profit business model (I'm gonna see if I can get companies like Starbucks to license it), I will be traveling and dispensing books at my expense, in perhaps the world's first ""Uninvited Book Tour.""</p>
<p>You see, normally, somebody courts YOU to go on a book tour...this is a system that makes economic sense, but not much ""dream-realization"" sense.</p>
<p>This is because (and scientists have proven this) the Universe works backwards; the best way to get a girl is to have a girlfriend already, the best way to get things for free is to be rich, and the best way to get a book tour is to already be successful and popular.</p>
<p>If you've listened to the FRAUDCast you already know; we don't wait to be ""invited to success.""  Life is about creating moments, not hoping for them. The truth (in my life, anyway) is that simply having dreams is not good enough to break free--other people have to want you to win, and that can only come from quality work, good vibes and a willingness to reach out.</p>
<p>Along the way I will be doing FRAUDCast episodes, blogging, taking photos, and anything else I can stuff in.</p>
<p>I plan on embarking (or is it disembarking?) When I get the money.  Once I get enough funds to go, I'll go.  No fixed dates yet; I need this campaign to raise the cash, and also to prove that listener interest is high enough before I take the trip.  Make sense?      </p>
<p>I NEED HELP. </p>
<p>Captain Awesome and I have pulled together to get the word out and ask for donations.  Even as little as 1 dollar is about 7 miles worth of gas (that's MATH, homie) and that's nothing to sneeze at!</p>
<p>I have calculated the costs, and for the books, gas, rooms, and incidentals, a round trip out to Kansas and back should cost about $1500.  So I am going to try to raise $5000 to enable additional traveling--I want to literally make it ACROSS America, book a LOT of other stops, and create MUCH more content during the tour, but because of costs I cannot yet plan anything beyond Captain Awesome in Kansas. </p>
<p>In the end, I will put whatever I DO raise to use for the show. </p>
<p>To alleviate fears that I may run off and try to construct a Monorail with the money, my cost breakdown is below. </p>
<p>• BOOKS: For the 15 copies I will be surreptitiously planting throughout my travel, the cost is approximately $150.</p>
<p>• GAS: 3700 Miles (The route as I have planned it so far), divided by 30 m.p.g. (my gas mileage), times about $4 (approximate per-gallon price of gas) = Approximately $493.</p>
<p>• LODGING WHILE ON THE ROAD: Some sort of a room (about $75 per night, I seek rooms slightly above fugitive quality) Times 4 (two nights each way) = Approximately $300.</p>
<p>• FOOD AND INCIDENTALS: (Things I have failed to imagine so far, likely prostitutes, moderate chance of Peyote): $500.</p>

<p>Many thanks to all our listeners and fans!  Let's ROLL.</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","Greetings, fans and supporters of the ASHBATH.COM FRAUDCast!
I, Lester Greystone, will be launching a book tour in order to promote my book, Ugly as HELL.
I will be driving to visit Captain Awesome in Kansas to promote the book.  A MEGASODE will be recorded and aired from there.  I will take 15 copies of my book, Ugly as HELL, and stash them in random locations along the way, and/or give them to random individuals. 
Using my patented reverse-profit business model (I'm gonna see if I can get companies like Starbucks to license it), I will be traveling and dispensing books at my expense, in perhaps the world's first ""Uninvited Book Tour.""
You see, normally, somebody courts YOU to go on a book tour...this is a system that makes economic sense, but not much ""dream-realization"" sense.
This is because (and scientists have proven this) the Universe works backwards; the best way to get a girl is to have a girlfriend already, the best way to get things for free is to be rich, and the best way to get a book tour is to already be successful and popular.
If you've listened to the FRAUDCast you already know; we don't wait to be ""invited to success.""  Life is about creating moments, not hoping for them. The truth (in my life, anyway) is that simply having dreams is not good enough to break free--other people have to want you to win, and that can only come from quality work, good vibes and a willingness to reach out.
Along the way I will be doing FRAUDCast episodes, blogging, taking photos, and anything else I can stuff in.
I plan on embarking (or is it disembarking?) When I get the money.  Once I get enough funds to go, I'll go.  No fixed dates yet; I need this campaign to raise the cash, and also to prove that listener interest is high enough before I take the trip.  Make sense?      
I NEED HELP. 
Captain Awesome and I have pulled together to get the word out and ask for donations.  Even as little as 1 dollar is about 7 miles worth of gas (that's MATH, homie) and that's nothing to sneeze at!
I have calculated the costs, and for the books, gas, rooms, and incidentals, a round trip out to Kansas and back should cost about $1500.  So I am going to try to raise $5000 to enable additional traveling--I want to literally make it ACROSS America, book a LOT of other stops, and create MUCH more content during the tour, but because of costs I cannot yet plan anything beyond Captain Awesome in Kansas. 
In the end, I will put whatever I DO raise to use for the show. 
To alleviate fears that I may run off and try to construct a Monorail with the money, my cost breakdown is below. 
• BOOKS: For the 15 copies I will be surreptitiously planting throughout my travel, the cost is approximately $150.
• GAS: 3700 Miles (The route as I have planned it so far), divided by 30 m.p.g. (my gas mileage), times about $4 (approximate per-gallon price of gas) = Approximately $493.
• LODGING WHILE ON THE ROAD: Some sort of a room (about $75 per night, I seek rooms slightly above fugitive quality) Times 4 (two nights each way) = Approximately $300.
• FOOD AND INCIDENTALS: (Things I have failed to imagine so far, likely prostitutes, moderate chance of Peyote): $500.
• TOTAL: About $1500.
Again, I am asking for a total of $5000; $1500 is only for the minimal trip I have planned so far; to hit the East Coast will easily cost me another (larger) shitload of wampum.

IF YOU REALLY WANNA BREAK MY BALLS ABOUT MONEY:

<h3>Winter Tangerine Review is a literary journal dedicated to exposing the best poetry, prose and art from young writers to established writers, all over the world. </h3>
<p>It was only after receiving rejection letter after rejection letter that I realized how difficult it was for a young writer to break into the writing industry. Established journals were definitely more willing to publish well-known writers who have a name to back them, rather than unknown writers who would be a risk. I decided to create Winter Tangerine Review because I feel that every writer, from the 17 year old poet in Alaska to Joyce Carol Oates, deserves a chance to be published.</p>
<p>Now, with a prospective staff of over 40, Winter Tangerine is a thriving source of literary and artistic talent. We have the most qualified, diverse staff from all over the world, from England to Australia to Singapore to Spain. We plan to publish our first issue in May- but we need some help doing that.</p>
</div>

Everything my amazing staff is doing is with the knowledge that there is no salary- they aren't getting paid for it. All the reviews and critiques are made solely on volunteer work, with the hope that maybe they'll be able to hold the tangible fruit of their labor, the journal for which they worked for. I would really appreciate it if you'd help us make this dream a reality.</li>

It doesn't matter who you are- a Wall St. business man, or a single mom in Toronto- the arts influences your life. Literature is everywhere; art is everywhere, but the writer and the artist is constantly neglected. By contributing, you're helping us change that.</p>

<p>THE ARCH CONSERVATIVE is a student-run journal of opinion and <a href=""http://www.archconuga.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> serving the University of Georgia. Founded in the Fall of 2013, it articulates the tenets and nuances of a thought tradition that is too often neglected on campus.

<h3>I've been blessed to write as an independent journalist for 16 years now and broadcast on a public radio station for more than 10 years.  Being an independent journalist is great work and very rewarding but when news breaks, it breaks and it waits for no one.</h3>
<p>It doesn't care if you'll have the money to buy this awesomely low ticket on Friday.  Or if the last rental car available at your destination spot is $50 over your budget.  LOL!  News waits for no one.</p>
<p>I get many calls asking and inviting me to come to various cities to cover many hard hitting issues and incidents but travel arrangements on a breaking news cycle for this indepedent journalist is often brutal. </p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because your news is important to you and I've had to turn away many stories just because I couldn't get there.  Writing and interviewing for radio from my central area is sufficient oft times but in some cases, you've just got to get those pumps on the ground to give the readers and listeners the full breadth of the story and what people are dealing with; their advocacy and the voices of their advocates often ignored in mainstream media.</p>
<p>Any donation large or small will help me to get to those people and their stories and any contribution would be greatly appreciated.</p>
Several key areas right now are Sanford Florida with people's continuing organizing around the Zimmerman verdict; New York, for the same; the San Francisco Bay Area/Oakland, where inmates are waging a grueling hunger strike and advocates are supporting them outside the walls and, families like Oscar Grant's are continuing to mobilize with other victims' families against police murders and police brutality; and Arkansas, where action is drumming up around Chavis Carter. Remember him:  he allegedly committed suicide while handcuffed in police custody.  AND in Columbia, where Afro Columbians are holding their 1st National Congress around the government's recognition and implementation of their rights as a sovereign people.</div>

<p>The grand ideas behind this book are directly resulted from the creative union of Alex Godbold and Rachel Toney. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>        Stylistically inspired by the epic illuminations and grimoires of the 11th and 12th centuries, <strong><em>Solaris Compendium</em></strong> will be a comprehensive work of adventure-based, participatory journalism, collaborative art, astronomy, esoteric geometry, history, hidden history, anthropology, folktale, shamanic-based geomancy and documentary photography. <strong><em>Solaris Compendium</em></strong> will be compiled throughout Mexico and beyond in the days leading up to and following December 21st, 2012.</p>

<p>        The ultimate goal of this project is to document a time in place and space that has been anticipated by many cultures throughout history. It seems  this ""New Age"" is actually a resurgence of old, ancient wisdom and energy that is being brought back to light through the open minds of creative people. Whatever happens, big or small, celestial or cultural, physical or metaphysical, known or unknown, we will be there to document, preserve, and expound upon the experience in creative ways. Like any book, we hope that<strong><em>Solaris Compendium</em></strong> can serve as a kind of multi-faceted reference for future humans. Hopefully we can inspire the future...the way our past inspires us today.  </p>

<p>       </p>
<p>        Of the <strong>four</strong> initial master copies of <strong><em>Solaris Compendium</em></strong> we hope to create, three of which will be donated to the <em>Jose Vasconcelos Library</em> in Mexico City, Mexico, the <em>Swiss National Library</em> in Berne, Switzerland and the <em>Library of Congress</em> in Washington, D.C. The fourth copy will be made available for future projects that have yet to be determined. A digital copy of <strong><em>Solaris Compendium</em></strong> will also be made available for free online. </p>
<p>        If this project were to be overfunded (dreamin' big), any remaining amount would be used to create as many master copies as possible, to be donated to as many major libraries and collections as possible. We're hoping for a world-wide communication and preservation of time, knowledge and history. </p>
<p>        Anyone wishing to contribute their own work to <strong><em>Solaris Compendium</em> </strong>is fully encouraged to do so! Though we already have a healthy handful of talented artists, writers and other creative individuals lined up to collaborate on this enchanted project, we will gratefully include any appropriate submissions from around the globe. Artistic contributors and pledgers alike will be featured in a special section of the book. :)</p>

The grand ideas behind this book are directly resulted from the creative union of Alex Godbold and Rachel Toney. 
 
        Stylistically inspired by the epic illuminations and grimoires of the 11th and 12th centuries, Solaris Compendium will be a comprehensive work of adventure-based, participatory journalism, collaborative art, astronomy, esoteric geometry, history, hidden history, anthropology, folktale, shamanic-based geomancy and documentary photography. Solaris Compendium will be compiled throughout Mexico and beyond in the days leading up to and following December 21st, 2012.
 


Raw illustration of outside cover and inside spread (measuring 9""x12"")
 
Solaris Compendium will feature:

 600+ pages of metaphysical wonder both ancient and modern 
 High quality + heavyweight parchment paper
 Finely detailed metal hinges, custom made by hand
 Old World style codex binding
 Antiqued brown leather cover, colored with naturally found dyes
 
          
Inspirational photo of inside book (source unknown)
 
        The ultimate goal of this project is to document a time in place and space that has been anticipated by many cultures throughout history. It seems  this ""New Age"" is actually a resurgence of old, ancient wisdom and energy that is being brought back to light through the open minds of creative people. Whatever happens, big or small, celestial or cultural, physical or metaphysical, known or unknown, we will be there to document, preserve, and expound upon the experience in creative ways. Like any book, we hope thatSolaris Compendium can serve as a kind of multi-faceted reference for future humans. Hopefully we can inspire the future...the way our past inspires us today.  

(profeciamaya2012.wordpress.com)
       
        Of the four initial master copies of Solaris Compendium we hope to create, three of which will be donated to the Jose Vasconcelos Library in Mexico City, Mexico, the Swiss National Library in Berne, Switzerland and the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. The fourth copy will be made available for future projects that have yet to be determined. A digital copy of Solaris Compendium will also be made available for free online. 
        If this project were to be overfunded (dreamin' big), any remaining amount would be used to create as many master copies as possible, to be donated to as many major libraries and collections as possible. We're hoping for a world-wide communication and preservation of time, knowledge and history. 
        Anyone wishing to contribute their own work to Solaris Compendium is fully encouraged to do so! Though we already have a healthy handful of talented artists, writers and other creative individuals lined up to collaborate on this enchanted project, we will gratefully include any appropriate submissions from around the globe. Artistic contributors and pledgers alike will be featured in a special section of the book. :)
 
How You're Helping:
The majority of our budget goes to printing the four original books. Additional funding amounts will go to printing smaller, paperback versions of the book for our pledgers. Also factored into budget are creative supply costs, shipping, rewards, time to produce this project, and fees charged by Indiegogo and Paypal. 
Solaris Compendium will also feature a patron section, where project backers will have the opportunity to see their name beautifully displayed, as well as the opportunity to contribute original artwork, insights, recipes, photos, whatever and ever.  We see this section of the book as an expression of our gratitude for the people who made this all possible, as well as a chance for our backers to express something about themselves.

</h3><p>The Poet Laureate of Kansas program lifts up the poetic power of
language to enhance our lives and help us discover greater meaning,
courage and clarity. Started in 2005 with Dr. Jonathan Holden as the first Kansas Poet Laureate, followed by Dr. Denise Low in 2007, the program now features Caryn Mirriam-Goldberg as the Poet Laureate. In the past two years of her three-year term, she organized a Midwestern and then a National Convergence of State Poets Laureate; co-edited an anthology, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">An Endless Skyway: Poetry from the Poets Laureate; </span>presented many workshops, reading and trainings; shared podcasts and radio broadcasts on writing, and traveled the state widely to promote and encourage the literary arts.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Kansas Arts Commission's funding and staff were eliminated. With no
public funding forthcoming from the NEA or Kansas Arts Commission, we
turn to you -- the public -- to ask you to show how much you support
the literary arts, to keep the poet laureate on the road and doing
programming throughout the state, and to lay the groundwork for this
program to continue under the auspices of another organization in the
future.</p>
<h3 class=""western"">The Impact</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">In the past, tax dollars from Kansans
supported this very efficient, well-run and extremely inexpensive
program. Now we turn to you to help keep the current poet laureate in

However, some friends are going to Vegas on January 16, and I want to go in the worst way. 
Since I'm self-employed, and that comes with all sorts of financial uncertainties, I decided that to pay for this trip I would recruit backers and reward those who help with gifts ranging from personalized poems to t-shirts (since I run a t-shirt business) to random stuff I have.
What I Need & What You Get
 I need about $550 to pay for this trip. I understand there are more pressing monetary pursuits for all of you, so I'm willing to give you items commensurate with the amount of your contributions. Check the perks on the sidebar for the full rundown.

Naomi frequently writes about feminist issues and responds to issues in Canadian media. More specifically, Naomi writes about issues relating to missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, sex work, human trafficking, and her personal experiences in sex work, law school, and in general, her adventures in life. Her writings from her blog have been used in many courses at universities across Canada (generally, at no cost to the people using the writings) and many people from all around the world read her writing. <br/><br/>Since creating the blog, Naomi has used the same laptop—a trusty Mac (so old that they don’t make the kind she uses anymore). Over these years, Naomi has had to replace her screen, battery or power adapter/cord. Naomi is requesting help to raise funds to help purchase a new laptop. Contributing to this campaign will allow Naomi to continue to write at <a href=""http://www.kwetoday.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kwetoday.com</a>. Moreover, by contributing to the campaign, you will also permit Naomi to continue to organize with other activists and leaders in indigenous feminist and sex work communities.

<h3>What is ODOU?</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.odoumag.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ODOU</a>, is the world's only printed magazine about smell and perfume. It's for readers who love beautifully designed publications housing intelligent, in-depth features. And of course, for those who simply live through their noses.</p>
<p>Perhaps you've been there; the smell of cut grass and the memories of summers gone by, or the whiff of a passerby's perfume and your head turns. Maybe it's the smell of your newborn baby's head or your grandparent's cooking – nearly all of us have favourite and fond smells. Articles in ODOU discuss all these kinds of topics lightheartedly, longingly, scientifically, even lovingly.</p>
<p>We've carried articles about the journey of an essential oil distiller in the sunny Mediterranean, we got to know a perfumer and how they work, and we've been challenging the perfume-gender debate since issue one.</p>
<p>You won't find content about the latest trend, must-have celebrity scent, or even top-tips running down the inside fold because these already exist in print and that's not what we're interested in. ODOU is much more exploratory, curious and revealing. Its aim is to awaken your interest in your olfactory surroundings, to stop and smell the roses.</p>

<h3>The beta launch</h3>
<p>As a self-funded initiative, with very little marketing, ODOU has managed to sell over 700 copies across the world. This was great to test the water and see if there was a demand for this kind of publication, which there clearly is.</p>
<p>I started the magazine as a side project via an online, on-demand printing service. The quality of printing from this service is fine, but it's not great, and it doesn't allow for scalability and the practicalities associated with traditional printing. Getting to three issues was my first goal and I'm confident that future issues can be even better. I need use traditional bulk-printing to create a magazine that can be stocked in shops.</p>
<p>Currently ODOU comes out twice a year and that format works for us. In early 2014, <a href=""http://www.odoumag.com/blog/2014/3/odou-wins-jasmine-literary-award"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">three articles in issue one were nominated for a Jasmine Award</a> – the UK's prestigious competition for excellence in fragrance journalism, organised by the Fragrance Foundation. The lead article won the coveted Literary Award. And just this year, <a href=""http://www.odoumag.com/blog/2015/2/six-odou-articles-nominated-for-jasmine-awards-2014"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">six articles from issues two and three were nominated</a> in multiple categories, <a href=""http://www.odoumag.com/blog/2015/3/odou-wins-jasmine-literary-award"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">once again ODOU nabbed the Literary Award</a>. This kind of recognition spurs us on.</p>
<h3>The plan – issue four</h3>
<p>Currently issue four is already under way. It contains articles on the illustrious scent of ambergris, fragrance in Greek mythology and a personal account of a perfumer's journey in education.</p>
<p>For this upcoming issue, we decided it was time to walk away form on-demand printing. We just can't stock the magazine in shops with this service, and the cost per page is significantly higher, so traditional bulk-printing makes sense.</p>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3> <p></p>
<p>I tried raising funds on Kickstarter, whilst this was exciting, ultimately the all-or-nothing approach didn't work. So I'm on Indiegogo to raise funds to print issue four with a flexible option that enables me to use any of the funds raised whether or not I reach the goal.</p>
<p>I've already got the majority of the content in for issue four and work has already begun on laying out and experimenting with layouts and concepts.</p>
<p>Reaching the goal would mean printing issue four in a fitting format that's deserving of the content within. Backing ODOU issue four would enable the magazine to stand on its own for future issues. It would mean crafting a magazine with a befitting look and feel that could not have been achieved previously with an on-demand printing service.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I won't be developing digital versions of the magazine at this time.</p>
<p>I'm not going to pretend it's easy to self-finance a magazine. Which is why we're reaching out to scent-lovers, and lovers of niche magazines around the world to help get this issue made, by pre-ordering your copy, or supporting our campaign in other ways.</p>
<p>It's time to ramp up the game for issue four, and this is where we'd love your support.</p>

I have learnt so many things out of them as a young girl and they really boosted my imagination. A lot of times they helped me explain things I couldn’t understand. But why should we stop with this habit as adults? Why shouldn’t we explore the symbolism of pictures and find ourselves in written words again? This is why I made this project and this is why I believe it can help us find wonderself, even when we think we lost it.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p>I am Maruša Štibelj, a collage artist from Slovenia. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463390330/Alice_in_Wonderself__710_of_518_1_utrwol.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I
started to do this little art book project when I was staying in an artist
residency in Germany in 2015 (Alte Schule Hohenstein). It was supposed to be an exhibition about
relationship towards ourselves, but in the end it turned out to be much more
than that.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463390385/004_qtnk6u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I always wanted to write a book but lacked the courage to actually
publish something. Well, that was until Alice came into my life. No, don’t be
confused. It’s not actually Alice from Wonderland even though she was a great
inspiration for me. It’s a different Alice, already grown up but this time
totally lost in her thoughts and well, her life. To get out of this mess, she
needs to pick up the phone and call herself and when she does, the
adventure of finding Wonderself begins.</span><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463389415/4_dq5skq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">To find out more about my artwork and references please

<p><b>THE PICTURE BOOK</b></p>
<p>The book contains 8 collages, which are in size of 80×100cm in
real life, so you can imagine there are a lot of collage details. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463389904/Alice_in_Wonderself__253_of_271_jiexzn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The collages
are made out of old napkins (collecting napkins in Slovenia was a big hit in
the 60ies), old magazines, old family photos found on flea markets (from year
1920 and up) and colored paper.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463389961/Alice_in_Wonderself__396_of_558_b4q8gd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">In the story you will find creatures like ear

makes it suitable for adults.</p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">WHERE WILL THE MONEY
GO?</b><br/></p>
<p><b>PRINTING THE BOOK</b></p>
<p>I am doing this crowdfunding campaign because I want to show
the Wonderself around the world. Like my Alice in the books says “It’s not fun
to keep the good things only to yourself!” The book is already written and
illustrated with collages, but now I need some money to do a first edition of
the book - 100 hard cover copies. I am not a mathematician but in the end I
calculated I need around 1000 euros to do that.</p>
<p><b>DESIGNING THE BOOK</b></p>
<p>I am not going to do that, because the story and the
collages are good and I don’t want to mess it up with bad design, as I am the
worst when it comes to computer skills. And here is where Tanja, my good friend,
who is an excellent designer (specialized in books and usually helps me with
design stuff), comes into the picture. But now I really want to pay her, even
though she said she believes in the project and will do this for free. But
because I believe in this project too, I think I can raise money for her as
well.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463491882/484136_10151408746348802_400911385_n_wsxuyc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>PROMOTION</b></p>
<p>That takes time and money. I have time so now all I need is
some money for flyers, book promotions and so on.</p>
<p><b>OTHER STUFF</b></p>
<p>And finally, I want to take all the family and friends that

I have learnt so many things out of them as a young girl and they really boosted my imagination. A lot of times they helped me explain things I couldn’t understand. But why should we stop with this habit as adults? Why shouldn’t we explore the symbolism of pictures and find ourselves in written words again? This is why I made this project and this is why I believe it can help us find wonderself, even when we think we lost it.
BACKGROUND
I am Maruša Štibelj, a collage artist from Slovenia. I
started to do this little art book project when I was staying in an artist
residency in Germany in 2015 (Alte Schule Hohenstein). It was supposed to be an exhibition about
relationship towards ourselves, but in the end it turned out to be much more
than that.I always wanted to write a book but lacked the courage to actually
publish something. Well, that was until Alice came into my life. No, don’t be
confused. It’s not actually Alice from Wonderland even though she was a great
inspiration for me. It’s a different Alice, already grown up but this time
totally lost in her thoughts and well, her life. To get out of this mess, she
needs to pick up the phone and call herself and when she does, the
adventure of finding Wonderself begins.To find out more about my artwork and references please
visit my portfolio site here: www.marusastibelj.com
THE PICTURE BOOK
The book contains 8 collages, which are in size of 80×100cm in
real life, so you can imagine there are a lot of collage details. The collages
are made out of old napkins (collecting napkins in Slovenia was a big hit in
the 60ies), old magazines, old family photos found on flea markets (from year
1920 and up) and colored paper.In the story you will find creatures like ear
butterfly, chicken with a golden palace, octopus that looks like a politician,
talking house, fat snake of fear…. What is special about this book is that
Alice symbolically grows through the book. In every collage she is a different
girl though. I would say that symbolism plays a big role in this book and that
makes it suitable for adults.WHERE WILL THE MONEY
GO?
PRINTING THE BOOK
I am doing this crowdfunding campaign because I want to show
the Wonderself around the world. Like my Alice in the books says “It’s not fun
to keep the good things only to yourself!” The book is already written and
illustrated with collages, but now I need some money to do a first edition of
the book - 100 hard cover copies. I am not a mathematician but in the end I
calculated I need around 1000 euros to do that.
DESIGNING THE BOOK
I am not going to do that, because the story and the
collages are good and I don’t want to mess it up with bad design, as I am the
worst when it comes to computer skills. And here is where Tanja, my good friend,
who is an excellent designer (specialized in books and usually helps me with
design stuff), comes into the picture. But now I really want to pay her, even
though she said she believes in the project and will do this for free. But
because I believe in this project too, I think I can raise money for her as
well.PROMOTION
That takes time and money. I have time so now all I need is
some money for flyers, book promotions and so on.
OTHER STUFF
And finally, I want to take all the family and friends that
helped me out to dinner. Maybe they helped just with an idea, a cheer up talk,
or maybe I want to thank them just because they are sticking with me on this
artist path that I chose to be on.WHAT'S UP WITH PERKS?To support the project and to make it happen you can choose between this perks: - The standard text eBook and a personal email of thanks with a picture of a telephone collage postcard as a reminder so you don’t forget to talk to yourself.- Package of postcards (5 different postcards) – images from the collages in the

<h3>""Back Room""</h3>
<p>Lawrence ""Larry"" Smith had never been one to take chances. Playing by the rules was how he lived his life and built his career. But then Tracy walked out and Aksel went off the rails, all in the same week, and just like that Larry's world was shattered.</p>
<p>As World Aid Corps' (WAC) Middle portfolio began to crash and burn somewhere between the windswept deserts of southern Syria and the English-themed pubs of Amman, Larry found himself pulled into the murky world of cross-border humanitarian operations. Little could he know that the truth of what actually happened with grant US-008-58673-0062 would spiral through the cramped offices of the Ronald Reagan Building, smoky pubs in Sweifiah, and the dusty planes of As Sweidah. What connected Aksel, head of office for WAC in Amman to a Syrian warlord with international ambition? Would Larry take the fall for Aksel’s fast-and-loose style? Would he survive outside the safety of the D.C. headquarters? And what would become of the alluring but mysterious Hannah?</p>
<p>This is the sixth book, and fifth humanitarian novel by veteran humanitarian, J.</p>

<p>The Impact</p>
<p>By contributing to this important project, you're directly making the world better in three ways:</p>
<p>You're helping to further establish Evil Genius Publishing, a tiny indie publisher that focuses on the humanitarian industry: books by, for, and about aid workers. This will be Evil Genius' fifth unique publication. Every little bit of experience we get makes us all that much better.</p>
<p>You're contributing to the amount of writing and literature out there specifically for and about the humanitarian aid industry that isn't dry, boring, pretentious, technocratic, academic drudgery. The medical field has Dean Koontz and Grey's Anatomy; the spy world has Robert Ludlum. But what does the aid world have?

<p>You're helping up to three starving artists gain real world experience (me, the writer; my freelance editor, trying to make a go of it; and the person who will create the original cover art). Writing is hard. Editing and drawing are even harder. The world needs more of all three. <i><strong>Be part of the solution.</strong></i></p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>As we said above, the manuscript for this book has already been written: <i>Back Room </i>will absolutely be published. It's just a matter of time, and a matter of what the final, published version will look like. Some of the primary challenges in releasing a book like this is that things tend to take longer than projected. </p>
<p>Some specific things that might delay the release of <i>Back Room</i>:</p>
<p>A big disaster happens and J. gets deployed (I'm a disaster response manager in real life. Some times my real job happens).</p>
<p>The editor and artist get slammed with real life (kids, day jobs, etc.), and take longer than expected.</p>
<p>Beta-readers (see below) take longer than expected to give their feedback.</p>
<p>How Evil Genius works with these kinds of challenges:</p>
<p>Total transparency about delays, challenges, revised deadlines. We'll update the Evil Genius and Tales From the Hood (author's personal) Facebook pages with regular updates so that contributors and readers know what's going on.</p>

</ul><h2> </h2><h2>About the Author</h2><p>Colleen McFarland’s expertise is organizational change management. She works with leaders who appreciate the value of anticipating and preparing for the impact a business change will have on their customers and employees. She has seen the benefits of good change management on business outcomes and culture. She is also a huge advocate of networking and has made it part of her every day life. Being open to others, getting to know them, working to understand their point of view, and learning from them is what she does best.<br/><br/>Colleen was curious if companies were leveraging employee data the way she has seen customer data being used. She’s been impressed with customer experiences she’s had that demonstrate the smart use of data to better understand what’s important to her and provide it. She wondered if the same investments were being made to better the employee experience and inspire employees to push themselves to set and meet personal goals.<br/><br/>In her personal life, the data savviness of young adults has wowed her. She and her husband John have two young adult sons. Her research for this book led her to learn about the rise of mental illness in young adults and its link to the overuse of technology that robs individuals of face-to-face contact. Colleen believes that, with the help of data, the workplace offers the opportunity for individuals to identify that they need to make lifestyle changes to improve their wellness and lead lives of purpose.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Colleen at colleenmcfarland1@gmail.com and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleenmcfarland1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleenmcfarland1/</a>.</p><h2> </h2><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

 About the AuthorColleen McFarland’s expertise is organizational change management. She works with leaders who appreciate the value of anticipating and preparing for the impact a business change will have on their customers and employees. She has seen the benefits of good change management on business outcomes and culture. She is also a huge advocate of networking and has made it part of her every day life. Being open to others, getting to know them, working to understand their point of view, and learning from them is what she does best.Colleen was curious if companies were leveraging employee data the way she has seen customer data being used. She’s been impressed with customer experiences she’s had that demonstrate the smart use of data to better understand what’s important to her and provide it. She wondered if the same investments were being made to better the employee experience and inspire employees to push themselves to set and meet personal goals.In her personal life, the data savviness of young adults has wowed her. She and her husband John have two young adult sons. Her research for this book led her to learn about the rise of mental illness in young adults and its link to the overuse of technology that robs individuals of face-to-face contact. Colleen believes that, with the help of data, the workplace offers the opportunity for individuals to identify that they need to make lifestyle changes to improve their wellness and lead lives of purpose.For more information, you can connect with Colleen at colleenmcfarland1@gmail.com and https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleenmcfarland1/. Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p><br/><i>Rise</i> is about how you can make the best out of the experiences that you have experienced in order to have a life worth living. No matter where you come from, it is important to understand that you are unique, and your uniqueness should be an asset when you walk into a room full of people that are different than you. <br/><br/>My name is Nia Rainer and I am the author of <i>Rise</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to show people the importance of believing in yourself, regardless of what the world may tell you. In a world where there is always a standard to live by, it is important that you stay true to who you are and appreciate the experiences, stories, and memories that make you the best person that you can be. It does not matter where you come from or the experiences that made you believe that you were not enough. What matters is that you have potential, regardless of how unorthodox your background may be. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your inner badass.

<p>How can I give back to my community?</p>
<p>How do I thrive in a world that always wants to tell me no?</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The Magpie Anthology will be curated by Christine Taylor (photographer) and Amber Beard (writer). We both have long backgrounds in publishing and magazines, are passionate about the written word and fabulous imagery and realise that there is a gap in the market for a great online blog / magazine hybrid - a blogzine! Ideal for reading when you're travelling, on the go or just about anywhere, The Magpie Anthology will showcase what's going on here, there and everywhere; from travel and food to wellbeing, art and culture - there's a big wide world out there that needs talking about. Editorial contributions will come from a wide range of contributors and we are eager to hear from any writers or photographers with great ideas.</p>
<p>The blogzine will be based on a Near, Far, Further basis - so where your near is will depend on where you might be reading it and will be a perfect platform for restaurants, hotels, holiday accommodation, galleries, publishers, shops, designers and influencers to showcase their wares through specifically targeted editorial and reviews.</p>
<p>For businesses we will work on the basis of editorially led promotion rather than advertising as we believe that this is more in keeping with our format. Editorial will be available on a paid for basis and can be written in house or by the client. The benefit of this format is a live link to your website, social media and e mail thus ensuring immediate engagement. Unlike a printed format which will ultimately be  discarded, The Mapgie Anthology will enable readers to store articles for future reading or reference which will add to the longevity of your presence. As with editorial, imagery can be produced in house or submitted and will be edited by us.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need funding to realise our dream project, to invest into what we believe will be an exciting new platform for readers and advertisers alike. Our funding will cover the initial website build and publicity materials and will set us on our way.</p>
<p>There are some small perks to helping us. We have some beautiful cards which we'll be sending out, featuring Christine's photographs, online shout outs for businesses and a launch event in September that anyone funding £100 or over will be invited to. </p>
<p>We understand that not everyone can afford to fund us, but we'll still need help with editorial topics and great reviews of where you've been, what you've done and how you did it! The Magpie Anthology will also devote some of its pages to charity and these will, of course, be free of charge.</p>
</div><div><p> </p></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of your funding help will be that we will have a fabulous project up and running by the beginning of September. We will have two members of staff on a part time basis to assist us with the techy stuff and the accounts - so we'll be providing employment too.</p>
<p>We'd love you to be even a small part of this right at the beginning and we'd also love you to tell you friends AND most importantly subscribe to what will be something just a little bit different from the norm.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>Conceal::Reveal</i> is a story of entrepreneurship in the defense innovation ecosystem before, during, and leaning into our post-COVID world. <br/><br/>My name is Julie Willis and I am the author of <i>Conceal::Reveal</i>. I wrote this book because my transition from being a government contractor, inside Army Futures Command, to being an entrepreneur in defense innovation, exposed me to opportunities for the military and the defense industrial base to protect and defend our country.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what is blocking the disruptive technology our warfighters need (yikes). I want you to see this book as an opportunity to understand defense entrepreneurs and enable them to conduct critical research and development. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of entrepreneurship and the defense industry in 2020 through narratives like:<ul>
<li>The true cost of research and development: what small businesses have to spend in time and money to contribute to national security.</li>
<li>The test of COVID: how my startup, DEFIANT Communication, pivoted to create a community that serves the disruptors. </li>
</ul>You will love this book if you can handle a raw, honest look at the way business is done in defense. <i>Conceal::Reveal</i> speaks to public servants and entrepreneurs who want to grapple with the real challenges of research and development in a new way. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Conceal::Reveal</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>How can I contribute to the success of our military in 2028 (and beyond)?</li>
<li>What systems are we willing to question to make that happen? </li>
<li>What trade-offs are we able to make to support innovation?</li>
</ul>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing the modernization of our military will change us all for the better. <h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book - Conceal::Reveal</h3>My book is written in 3 Parts: <br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + additional chapters. My first editor told me this is a love story. I’m not sure I agree, but I have to admit I am weirdly committed to the warfighter. In Part 1, you will learn why.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains the stories from the first few months of my startup life. From airport lounge hopping to getting close to a couple near-scandals, it’s a bumpy ride. Thankfully for me, I was moving too fast to feel it. <br/><br/>Part 3 contains a breakup (boo), the collision of COVID and DEFIANT, and the struggle to find a way forward. You will learn what I learned - that we’ve created a system that enables and effectively endorses taking a percentage off research and development dollars in the United States.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains the process of me figuring out how I can do something about this problem. There was no doubt I’d address it, but I didn't have a solution...yet. <br/><br/>Part 5 is when I set everything you now see in motion. Tada!<h3> </h3>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Julie Willis is the founder and CEO of DEFIANT Communication, a strategic communication firm dedicated to making connections that make an impact in defense innovation.</p>
<p>Did we mention <i>Conceal::Reveal</i> is basically a love story? Julie is not a Disney fairytale princess. She’s the sidekick in a bad romcom who’s married to her work. Why? Because in a different chapter she was the spouse left behind to worry if her husband would come home. From Iraq. For three years. It matters to her that this country equips the people who do the job that the rest of us are unwilling or unable to do.</p>
<p>Outside of her role as CEO and romcom sidekick, she is devoted to ice cream. Julie once went into a total fangirl tailspin when she met the man who invented Halo Top. It was so embarrassing that she felt compelled to apologize to his wife. Her response was, “are you kidding? This is the best day of his life!” Not because Julie did a great fangirl impression, but because he received an award. We just want to clarify that.</p>
<p>For more information you can visit <a href=""https://www.defiantcomms.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DEFIANT's website</a>, connect with Julie at julie.willis@defiantcomms.com, and follow the journey on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/julielynnewillis/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/defiantcomms/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>. </p>

I’m not sure I agree, but I have to admit I am weirdly committed to the warfighter. In Part 1, you will learn why.Part 2 contains the stories from the first few months of my startup life. From airport lounge hopping to getting close to a couple near-scandals, it’s a bumpy ride. Thankfully for me, I was moving too fast to feel it. Part 3 contains a breakup (boo), the collision of COVID and DEFIANT, and the struggle to find a way forward. You will learn what I learned - that we’ve created a system that enables and effectively endorses taking a percentage off research and development dollars in the United States.Part 4 contains the process of me figuring out how I can do something about this problem. There was no doubt I’d address it, but I didn't have a solution...yet. Part 5 is when I set everything you now see in motion. Tada!

About the Author
Julie Willis is the founder and CEO of DEFIANT Communication, a strategic communication firm dedicated to making connections that make an impact in defense innovation.
Did we mention Conceal::Reveal is basically a love story? Julie is not a Disney fairytale princess. She’s the sidekick in a bad romcom who’s married to her work. Why? Because in a different chapter she was the spouse left behind to worry if her husband would come home. From Iraq. For three years. It matters to her that this country equips the people who do the job that the rest of us are unwilling or unable to do.
Outside of her role as CEO and romcom sidekick, she is devoted to ice cream. Julie once went into a total fangirl tailspin when she met the man who invented Halo Top. It was so embarrassing that she felt compelled to apologize to his wife. Her response was, “are you kidding? This is the best day of his life!” Not because Julie did a great fangirl impression, but because he received an award. We just want to clarify that.
For more information you can visit DEFIANT's website, connect with Julie at julie.willis@defiantcomms.com, and follow the journey on LinkedIn and Instagram. 
 
Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.One of the many risks that comes with sending pre-sale copies of a book is getting the books to you on time. I'm working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you! The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>Overgrown is a collection of poetry that explores life, death, and rebirth in the context of the natural world and a year of life experiences.<br/><br/>My name is Carolyn Maynard and I am the author of Overgrown. I wrote this book because poetry has always been a favorite writing style of mine, but it is one that is often overlooked. Before the thought of writing a book ever crossed my mind, I would write short phrases or poems in a journal, and the ideas kept flowing. I wanted to create a poignant and reflective collection of poems to revere life’s beauty and challenges and to inspire readers to examine their lives in new ways.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will see the recurring cycle of life, death, and rebirth through the book’s core themes, and interpret each piece to your benefit. In this book, I explore ways of navigating life with purpose and finding a way back to joy from hardship. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a celebration of both the mundane and the extraordinary facets of life and other people.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll be able to observe the following topics:<p>August chapter: Building personal strength internally and externally</p>
<p>October chapter: Acknowledgment of pain but a refusal to suffer</p>
<p>November chapter: Somber reflection on challenges, and a surrender to nostalgia </p>
<p>April chapter: The various nuances of love and relationships as they live and die</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in how we navigate life, and you are open to reflection on the various perspectives and occurrences that shape who we are and how we live. There is something for everyone among each piece in this book. </p> <h3>The Book - Overgrown</h3>
<p>The book is written in 4 sections, each named for a month of the year that I feel best represents the theme of each respective section.....<br/><br/>The August section was inspired by belief that life, no matter what, is always worth living. It explores finding strength as a woman in the world, and then simply as a person. This section also celebrates close relationships and how crucial they are to a healthy life.<br/><br/>The October section deals with the difficulties of enduring toxicity and moving on from troubling encounters. with other people. It’s an autumnal reflection on the challenges we are given, often in the face of futility.<br/><br/>The November section is darker than the other sections, as it explores the multifaceted nature of death – that of relationships, parts of ourselves, and the world around us as winter sets in.<br/><br/>The April section is celebratory and representative of rebirth. In the heart of spring, April sees the world born again, covered in flowers and new life. This section contains several poems about finding love in all its forms.</p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Todas las cosas buenas se llaman Dios</strong> narra el trayecto vital de un joven de gran fe religiosa y de cómo, tras perderla, sustituye la figura sagrada por un movimiento social.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Medellín (Colombia) se convierte en Eterna Primavera: una ciudad cansada de la inseguridad en donde sus habitantes han decidido tomar la justicia por mano propia, castigando a los criminales en la calle. Erón Sera es el hijo adoptivo de un cura que trabaja como monaguillo en la iglesia de su padre y cuestiona sus creencias al confrontar la figura de un dios que nunca actúa contra las injusticias que se viven en su ciudad. Una noche, por conflictos con las licencias de construcción de la iglesia, la Alcaldía decide demolerla. La campana cae encima de Erón y lo deja atrapado dentro de ella por cuatro días y tres noches. Cuando el monaguillo sale de su encierro, al no encontrar respuestas al porqué Dios permite las cosas que permite, deja de creer en él. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Erón concluye que la figura de un dios justo debe existir y decide crear un movimiento que castigue las injusticias. Para ello cuenta con Lidia Toro, una periodista local interesada en su caso de la campana y Simón Caballero, un incógnito con habilidades para la pelea. Con el apoyo de algunos feligreces que van a la iglesia, expande su grupo de seguidores bajo el nombre de ‘Renacer’ y se esparce como un virus en Eterna Primavera. Santa, un periodista compañero de Lidia Toro, decide seguir la pista de Erón y su grupo para exponerlo públicamente pero para ello debe rebuscar entre las sombras y el periodista olvida, como a veces olvidamos todos, que son las sombras las que van detrás de nosotros.</p>

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p><i>Skilled: Why Customer Service is More than a First Job</i> focuses on the skills you can develop when you work in customer service. These skills are transferable and can be taken to any level in your career and in your personal life.<br/><br/>My name is Alma Angel and I am the author of <i>Skilled: Why Customer Service is More than a First Job</i>. I wrote this book because I want to highlight the skills people develop when they work in customer service or customer-facing roles.

Through these inspiring individuals and their stories, I hope that we can break down the societal stigmas surrounding bald men and women and come out stronger together as a result. <br/><br/>My name is Stephanie Yuen and I am the author of <i>Stronger Together.</i> I wrote this book because I wanted to be a voice for those who are going through their Alopecia journey right now and be able to spread awareness about this condition.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that Alopecia does not change someone’s personality. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with the themes of courage and positivity and learn alongside others about the importance of never judging a person based on their appearance.</p><p> </p><p>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of hardship and negating societal stigmas through narratives like:</p><ul>
<li>How many Alopecians have been subjected to the “he or she has cancer” stares or questions; however, I hope to negate the mindset that bald individuals are sick.</li>
<li>How hair does not hinder nor change one’s personality.</li>
<li>How society needs to normalize bald men and women</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>You will love this book if you are all about expressing positivity, changing the world for the better, and working towards unity.<br/><br/><i>Stronger Together</i> speaks to those with Alopecia and those without who want to grapple with society’s standards and body positivity in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Stronger Together</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>How does Alopecia affect one’s mental and emotional health?</li>
<li>Does appearance change the way others view you?</li>
<li>Why do societal standards play such a crucial factor in peoples’ daily lives? Due to the fact that they are so engraved in our minds that we might not even realize them, how can we negate those types of mindsets?</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing coming out stronger as a result of a hardship and dealing with a problem head-on will change us all for the better.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>The Book - <i>Stronger Together</i></strong></h2><p>The book is written in 5 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 - The Discovery </strong>contains the author’s note + 1 Chapter. Reader will learn about the process and chaotic feelings both my parents and I experienced when I learned that my hair was falling out. This chapter also discusses the rundown of the various types of Alopecia and the process I went through in attempt to treat it.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 - The Decision</strong> contains chapters 2-4. In Part 2 of my book, the reader will find out my decision behind shaving my head, my emotions as I head back to school, as well as my lifelong mentor that has helped shape me into the person I am today.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 - Social Stigmas</strong> contains chapters 5-10. Reader will learn the societal stigmas that Alopecians face daily and how we hope to negate that mindset. This part features insightful words from Dr. Angela Rodgers and Dr. Leslie Castelo-Soccio and inspiring stories from Nicolas Srut, Kylie Bamberger, Kevin Bull and Anthony Carrigan.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4 - Masks On</strong> contains chapters 11-14. This part demonstrates the “masks” that Alopecians wear as a way to cope with the new look through means of makeup, wigs, etc.<br/><br/><strong>Part 5 - Conclusion: The Way Forward</strong> contains chapters 15-19. In this part, the reader will gain insight from various individuals such as Shalice Ader, Chloe Bean, Deeann Graham, and so many more! These concluding chapters express hope for younger generations with Alopecia for there is an increased awareness for our condition through various social media platforms.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

Through these inspiring individuals and their stories, I hope that we can break down the societal stigmas surrounding bald men and women and come out stronger together as a result. My name is Stephanie Yuen and I am the author of Stronger Together. I wrote this book because I wanted to be a voice for those who are going through their Alopecia journey right now and be able to spread awareness about this condition.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that Alopecia does not change someone’s personality. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with the themes of courage and positivity and learn alongside others about the importance of never judging a person based on their appearance. In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of hardship and negating societal stigmas through narratives like:
How many Alopecians have been subjected to the “he or she has cancer” stares or questions; however, I hope to negate the mindset that bald individuals are sick.
How hair does not hinder nor change one’s personality.
How society needs to normalize bald men and women
 You will love this book if you are all about expressing positivity, changing the world for the better, and working towards unity.Stronger Together speaks to those with Alopecia and those without who want to grapple with society’s standards and body positivity in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that Stronger Together inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
How does Alopecia affect one’s mental and emotional health?
Does appearance change the way others view you?
Why do societal standards play such a crucial factor in peoples’ daily lives? Due to the fact that they are so engraved in our minds that we might not even realize them, how can we negate those types of mindsets?
 I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing coming out stronger as a result of a hardship and dealing with a problem head-on will change us all for the better. The Book - Stronger TogetherThe book is written in 5 parts.Part 1 - The Discovery contains the author’s note + 1 Chapter. Reader will learn about the process and chaotic feelings both my parents and I experienced when I learned that my hair was falling out. This chapter also discusses the rundown of the various types of Alopecia and the process I went through in attempt to treat it.Part 2 - The Decision contains chapters 2-4. In Part 2 of my book, the reader will find out my decision behind shaving my head, my emotions as I head back to school, as well as my lifelong mentor that has helped shape me into the person I am today.Part 3 - Social Stigmas contains chapters 5-10. Reader will learn the societal stigmas that Alopecians face daily and how we hope to negate that mindset. This part features insightful words from Dr. Angela Rodgers and Dr. Leslie Castelo-Soccio and inspiring stories from Nicolas Srut, Kylie Bamberger, Kevin Bull and Anthony Carrigan.Part 4 - Masks On contains chapters 11-14. This part demonstrates the “masks” that Alopecians wear as a way to cope with the new look through means of makeup, wigs, etc.Part 5 - Conclusion: The Way Forward contains chapters 15-19. In this part, the reader will gain insight from various individuals such as Shalice Ader, Chloe Bean, Deeann Graham, and so many more! These concluding chapters express hope for younger generations with Alopecia for there is an increased awareness for our condition through various social media platforms. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p>Dear the Man Upstairs is a family-friendly story told in letters between a young girl and “The Man Upstairs.” At nine years old, a girl begins writing letters to the“Man Upstairs,” and someone writes her back. It’s not God.<br/><br/>My name is Maytal Booth and I am the author of Dear the Man Upstairs. When I first began writing Dear the Man Upstairs, I did not know it would become a book. I was sitting in a creative writing class when I was sixteen years old and drafting a single narrative letter because that was what my teacher told me to do. I thought about who my classmates would choose as the recipients of their letters. Like every sixteen-year-old, I wanted to be different. I would not write a letter to a classmate, friend, enemy, or lover (because almost all teenage girls dream of lovers). I wanted to be totally outlandish in my letter and yet safely secured away from ridiculous.<br/><br/>So I thought to myself, “Who is the most out-there person someone could write a letter to? Who will no one else think to have as their recipient?” The answer came in a startling epiphany, “God.”<br/><br/>I grew up in a religious Jewish household. My father is a Rabbi and my mother is an educator of Judaism. God and related questions are often at the forefront of my mind, which is why I thought of a divine power so quickly as a recipient for my letter.<br/><br/>Once I had who was being written to, I needed to find out who was writing. As a child, I struggled with the many euphemisms for God. It was inconceivable to me that one being had so many names. So in one way to be funny, and in another way to make the work not explicitly religious, I decided that the writer of the letter was a child. She addressed the letter to “The Man Upstairs,” unaware of what exactly the name represents. It was just someone she’d heard her grandmother talk about a lot.<br/><br/>The letter took form then. She’s a fourth-grader (a grade I remember clearly, different (she gets scared of loud noises easily, like I did back in the day,) and she’s so unapologetically vibrant the people around her sometimes need to shield their eyes.<br/><br/>She’s curious in that first letter, asking questions to a stranger and hoping someone can make order of her chaotic world. When I shared it in class, my seatmate said, “You have to write more.”<br/><br/>So I kept writing and writing. I thought about what people often consider an ideal child: an extroverted, athletic, intelligent, empathetic, disciplined, and obedient angel. (No one really has children like this.)<br/><br/>The main character, in her own ways, has these attributes. Miss W. (that’s the name she calls herself in her letters with “The Man Upstairs” because he’s a stranger and she knows better than to give strangers her full name) is friendly, bright, and loving to those in her life. She is athletic and has discipline when it suits her. Miss W. also has a hard time sitting still, dealing with things that are uncomfortable for her, and understanding social norms. She sees a psychologist to help her develop strategies for a challenging world. Miss W. is hard to be around sometimes. Even if she is not what many people would consider an “ideal child,” she, to me, is still happy and healthy.<br/><br/>After I wrote a few letters, someone began to write my main character back.<br/><br/>The genre of this epistolary novel is young adult, but truthfully I believe it has broad appeal to anyone in a family. Mothers, daughters, fathers, grandfathers, and especially grandmothers will see themselves in some of the characters. My hope is that, in reading this book, you discover that even if you and your children are not always as extroverted, friendly, athletic, empathetic, intelligent, and successful as you’d like yourself and/or them to be, you and they are still beautiful and worthwhile.</p>

<h2><strong>About the Author</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Maytal Booth is a sophomore at Vanderbilt University. She spent her formative years as an elementary school student shamelessly plagiarizing Disney movies to create short stories about Jewish princesses. Although she is studying medicine because she understands it is challenging to support herself as a writer, Maytal is doing her best to pursue her dream of being a published author. She knows, “you miss every shot you don’t take, and make every shot you don’t miss”. She wrote this story based on her experience as a child and teacher of third through sixth-grade children. Many children are labeled as ""problem-kids"" simply because they cannot sit still, and this is a manner of thinking Maytal hopes to change with her book. In her free time, Maytal enjoys baking, reading, going on long walks and sleeping in.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Maytal Booth at maytal.w.booth@gmail.com and at her author page.</p>

<p><u><strong>OVERVIEW </strong></u></p>
<p>The Sensational Wonder Women coloring book was born out of my desire to inspire and empower women. After a traumatic heartbreak, art became my path for healing and self-awareness. I now want to use art to support women in their healing by helping them find joy, relaxation, and purpose through coloring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>DEDICATION</strong></u></p>
<p>This campaign is dedicated to women who have gone through emotional and/or traumatic experiences. I know first-hand what it is like to suffer from despair, feel depressed, and be hopeless. My wish is to bring light and hope to women by inspiring them to look within to find peace and meaning. Coloring helps facilitate this process as people often become more self-aware while experiencing creative moments.</p>
<p>We are witnessing very painful and emotional times in the world. I want to be able to provide moments of joy where women can shift their thoughts from negative to positive through creativity. </p>
<h3>The Sensational Wonder Women coloring book does this by celebrating and honoring powerful, diverse women. It was created with the intention of supporting women to get in touch with their creative senses and achieve a heightened level of happiness and self-fulfillment.</h3>

<p><u><strong>MY STORY</strong></u></p>
<p>My name is Claudia Marulanda, and I am a visual artist. I started my career as a graphic designer, then jumped into entrepreneurship. During this time, I had also begun to develop my art. Now, I am on the path of combining these two passions to make a successful art business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How did I come up with the idea for this coloring book?</strong></p>
<p>Although art has been my number one love since I was a child, my true creative and artistic expression surfaced following a painful experience I went through in 2012. As a result, my life took a turn and it led me to be here with you, sharing this magnificent book.</p>

</div></div>","OVERVIEW 
The Sensational Wonder Women coloring book was born out of my desire to inspire and empower women. After a traumatic heartbreak, art became my path for healing and self-awareness. I now want to use art to support women in their healing by helping them find joy, relaxation, and purpose through coloring.
 
DEDICATION
This campaign is dedicated to women who have gone through emotional and/or traumatic experiences. I know first-hand what it is like to suffer from despair, feel depressed, and be hopeless. My wish is to bring light and hope to women by inspiring them to look within to find peace and meaning. Coloring helps facilitate this process as people often become more self-aware while experiencing creative moments.
We are witnessing very painful and emotional times in the world. I want to be able to provide moments of joy where women can shift their thoughts from negative to positive through creativity. 
The Sensational Wonder Women coloring book does this by celebrating and honoring powerful, diverse women. It was created with the intention of supporting women to get in touch with their creative senses and achieve a heightened level of happiness and self-fulfillment.

 
Sensational Wonder Women is a:

38-page coloring book printed on quality paper, 8.5 x 11 inches, wire coil bound.
Includes 30 stunning illustrations of women, originally hand-drawn and recreated in a digital format to present you with a clean, graphic feel, just perfect for coloring.

Encouraging words woven into the hair of many of the illustrations, stating an affirmation or positive message.
Designs range in complexity, from simple to intricate.
Illustrations printed on one side only so there is no chance of color blotting.
Pages are perforated for easy removal for framing.
Appropriate for ages middle school to adult.

 

 
MY STORY
My name is Claudia Marulanda, and I am a visual artist. I started my career as a graphic designer, then jumped into entrepreneurship. During this time, I had also begun to develop my art. Now, I am on the path of combining these two passions to make a successful art business.
 
How did I come up with the idea for this coloring book?
Although art has been my number one love since I was a child, my true creative and artistic expression surfaced following a painful experience I went through in 2012. As a result, my life took a turn and it led me to be here with you, sharing this magnificent book.
 

 
WHY CONTRIBUTE?
If you are reading this far down on the page, chances are you are intrigued by my project, which is wonderful. So, here is the bottom line - I need your support. Plain and simple.
 
It is my hope and prayer to inspire, encourage, and empower women. To do this, I need your help in funding this project. The funding will be used to print and distribute this beautiful and powerful coloring book for women to start enjoying it and begin healing.
 
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP?
Please help me spread this message with others. It will mean the world to me if you share this my coloring book with anyone else that you think would love it too.
Indiegogo has great sharing tools! I would love for you to use one or all of them!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Hans Manzke, and I am the author of Democratizing Big Ideas. I wrote this book because I want to level the playing field with regard to the big ideas, frameworks, mental models, and insights that make the best leaders and humans so great. We all deserve equal access to what the world’s best thinkers have to offer, no matter our background, age, or profession, and we deserve it now.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that you don’t need to spend 15 years at a job accruing knowledge and research to tap into the world of big ideas. With this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for big ideas and reveal how they help us grow. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you land your dream job, make a big life change you feel unable to access, or learn about yourself and those around you more deeply and profoundly.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about big ideas that shift how the world thinks about itself and how we exist in it, as well as how each of us can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tune in to mindsets and approaches that supercharge critical thinking and identify and minimize mindsets that discourage critical thinking</li>
<li>Learn about the most valuable ideas, concepts, mindsets, frameworks, and insights that leaders from around the world would gift to their younger selves if they could go back in time</li>
<li>Push your own thinking and learning to new levels via compelling stories, data, and analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you want to begin or continue your own self-awareness journey or are looking for a supercharging force to help you achieve your full potential.<br/><br/>Democratizing Big Ideas is a non-fiction book that speaks to the brilliant and underprivileged, the young and ambitious, and established leaders who are looking to authentically access the next version of themselves and more deeply understanding their teams and environment through the lens of big ideas.</p>

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is finishing and delivering the completed book to the backer. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier. This means that your support guarantees you a copy of my book, mailed to your best address.I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone on the road to publication. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter with your friends, family and network. Please use #BigIdeasForAll and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so they can help amplify our efforts.
You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page
Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it. All this takes is a text message or Direct Message on social media.

Thank you for all of your love and support.Hans",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Welcome to my Dream Machine pre-order campaign!</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">My name is Lizz Larouge and I am a poet, artist and seer.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">For the past 10 years I have been writing poetry. What I consider to be downloads from soul and spirit. Over the past year I have carefully compiled a selection of my poems into a book which I have titled 'Dream Machine'. This project is self-published and comes direct to you from my heart. I have collaborated with one of my best friends, visionary artist Christina Mikelis who has brought my words to life in art form through her beautiful illustrations.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">As co-founder of global community Colours of Love, I have been privileged to witness hundreds of people speak their dream and manifest it into reality. I stand before you today (virtually!) to activate my dream; To bring my poetry book Dream Machine into reality.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">By supporting my dream, pre-ordering the Dream Machine book and goodies, your contribution goes directly to paying the artist, the local business printing my book and all the other exciting limited edition items available to you. </p>
<h3><strong>Why do I need your help?</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I am self-publishing this book. This means I front the costs of printing, of design, of production, of everything around the book. I also do the promotions, the marketing and distribution myself.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I have managed to eliminate or reduce a lot of costs, having people I know support me with the proofreading and the editing, doing all the video content and promotional graphics and social media etc myself and making clear and conscious choices where the budget is going.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">However, there are still thousands of pounds needed to get a coffee-table-worthy work of art like this off the ground. As an artist and self-employed businesswoman, this project would be hard to make a reality without the support of my global community. YOU!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I have a target to reach of £6517. <strong> </strong>Your contribution goes directly to paying the illustrative artist and the local small business printing my book plus all the other exciting limited edition items available to you. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This campaign is a huge ticket of trust and belief in myself and my gifts. So let me give you the details of the book and how you can be involved!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The book is printed on recycled paper and is available in Softcover and Hardback with a silver foil cover finish. The hardback edition is hand-sewn by local artisan book binders (I will document this process to share with you!) All books are signed by me and include a fold-out A2 poster featuring a brand new poem and art not included in the book itself. Each supporter will be personally thanked by me in print, in the Thankyou section of the book. Each supporter will be sent a mix I have created especially in celebration of Dream Machine. Each supporter will be invited to join me at the conclusion of my campaign for a virtual ‘wrap party’ so I can thank each and every one of you in person (virtually!)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The additional printed items - also limited edition - all feature the poetry and art of Dream Machine.  I have created a '<strong>Dreamy Bundle Set'</strong> for both the hardback and softcover - This is perfect option for all you Dream Machines out there and is jam packed with goodies including;</p>

Sweet Candy Press is run by Sage Adderley in Olympia,Washington. Sage has been running Sweet Candy Distro for over nine years, and recently decided to take a leap into small publishing. She is no stranger to the hard work and determination it takes to pull off this exciting venture. 
In August 2013, the press released their first title, Heavy Hangs the Head by Taryn Hipp and is currently planning the release of their second title, Everybody Else’s Girl by Sarah Sawyers-Lovett.
Sweet Candy Press uses a local family-owned printing company

Why do I want to support Jonas?

Jonas’s writing is that of a creative old soul. His voice is distinct and raw in the most beautiful way that raw writing can be presented. His characters dance through their life events emitting words that leave us all pondering and questioning. He makes readers feel. He makes us think. Jonas serves a platter of hectic issues, but feeds it to us gently, allowing us to carefully digest each bite. 


The funds raised will go towards the printing of The Greatest Most Traveling Circus. We are hoping to raise $2,000 to print 500–600 copies of the book.
Jonas has put together a wonderful variety of perks that include postcards, Cheer the Eff Up zines, copies of The Greatest Most Traveling Circus, personalized zines, lifetime subscriptions, AND oil paintings!

After my manuscript has been completely edited I'll be ready for publication and promotion. With any business it's always easier to promote the works when one has various items. 
Therefore, your donation will help me provide various types of printed material to help promote my book and the editing. The types of printed materials I have in mind are bookmarks, magnets, tote bags, pens, etc.
Feel free to contact me with any questions you have. I'll answer them to the best of my ability. 
Please help me make my dream... reality!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Laird Barron will be editing the inaugural volume of the Year’s Best Weird Fiction for <img alt=""Laird"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/900489/files/20130629062635-laird.jpg?1372512396"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 10px;""/>Undertow Publications.</p>
<p>Barron is one of finest practitioners of the weird tale. His work has been nominated for several awards, and has been reprinted in numerous “Year’s Best” anthologies.</p>
<p>Undertow Publications is home to the acclaimed weird journal Shadows &amp; Tall Trees. Our first publication, Apparitions, was a Shirley Jackson Award Finalist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""S&amp;TT5"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/900497/files/20130629063336-S_TT5_FRONT_ONLY.jpg?1372512818"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 10px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The publishing landscape has changed. The big publishers mostly still view weird fiction as a strange and esoteric thing. In short, it isn’t seen as a viable commercial opportunity.  But we think there is a need for such a volume. That is why we are appealing to you to help fund this and future volumes of the Year’s Best Weird Fiction. All the funds will be used to pay the editor, the contributors, the designers, typesetter, printing, shipping, etc. Your money will help support what we hope will be an annual and vital volume of the best weird fiction.</p>
<p>Each volume of the Year’s Best Weird Fiction will feature a different editor. Weird fiction is a diverse and eclectic mode of literature, and we are excited to see varying viewpoints. In fact, we are confident that the volume will see little if any overlap with the various other “Best Of” anthologies. And we could think of no one better than Laird Barron to helm the inaugural volume.</p>
<p>Along with up to 100,000 words of the finest strange fiction from the previous year, each volume will include an introduction from the editor, a year in review column, and a short list of other notable stories. If we reach our funding goal, the book will be available in trade-paperback format and as DRM-free ePub and Mobi eBooks. The Year’s Best Weird Fiction, Volume 1, is slated for publication in late summer/early fall of 2014.</p>
<p>Crowd-funding a book is akin to pre-ordering that book. However, we do hope you’ll take advantage of some of our other great perks and rewards. We’re really excited about the Year’s Best Weird Fiction, and hope you’ll support its publication. We can’t make this happen without you.</p>
<p>So … welcome to the Year’s Best Weird Fiction.</p>
<p>What is weird fiction?<img alt=""Wtales1923"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/900566/files/20130629075442-Wtales.jpg?1372517686"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 10px;""/></p>
<p>The simple answer is that it is speculative in nature, chiefly derived from pulp fiction in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, whose remit includes ghost stories, the strange and macabre, the supernatural, fantasy, myth, philosophical ontology, ambiguity, and featuring a helping of the outré. Weird fiction, at its best, is an intersecting of themes and ideas that explore and subvert the laws of Nature. It counts among its proponents older and newer writers alike: Robert Aickman, Laird Barron, Charles Beaumont, Ambrose Bierce, Octavia Butler, Ray Bradbury, Angela Carter, Neil Gaiman, Shirley Jackson, Kathe Koja, John Langan, Thomas Ligotti, Kelly Link, H. P. Lovecraft, and many others.</p>
<p><img alt=""WTales1925"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/900565/files/20130629075401-Weirdtales.jpg?1372517645"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 10px;""/></p>
<p>Weird fiction is not specifically horror or fantasy. And weird fiction is not new. It has always been present. That’s because it isn’t a genre, as such. This makes the prospect of defining weird fiction difficult, and perhaps ill advised. Weird fiction is a mode of literature that is present in other genres. Weird tales were penned long before publishers codified and attached genre labels to fiction. You can find weird fiction in literary journals, in horror magazines, fantasy and science fiction periodicals, and various other genre and non-genre journals and anthologies that are welcoming to speculative fiction of the fantastique.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There’s been renewed interest in weird fiction, spurred by the writings of the authors <img alt=""BlackWater"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/900564/files/20130629075343-blackwater.jpg?1372517624"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 10px;""/>mentioned above, and by the likes of Jeffrey Ford, Elizabeth Hand, Margo Lanagan, China Mieville, Reggie Oliver, Kaaron Warren, and by the publication of anthologies such as American Fantastic Tales, Black Water, Black Wings, The Weird, The Uncanny, Strange Tales; and journals such as Black Static, ChiZine, Shadows &amp; Tall Trees, and Weird Fiction Review.</p>
<p>Weird fiction is here to stay. Once the purview of esoteric readers, it is enjoying wider popularity. Throughout its storied history there has not been a dedicated volume of the year’s best weird writing. There are a host of authors penning weird and strange tales that defy easy categorization. Tales that slip through genre cracks. A yearly anthology of the best of these writings is long overdue.</p>
<h3><strong>Submitting material for consideration<br/></strong></h3>
<p>This is a reprint fiction anthology. Editor Laird Barron is only seeking material that was first published in 2013.</p>
<p>Publishers only are encouraged to send text files, preferably in Word, to: <a href=""mailto:bestweirdfiction@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bestweirdfiction@gmail.com</a> </p>
<p>Physical material is also acceptable. See address below.</p>
<p>Deadline for all material is January 7, 2014, but sooner (much sooner) is better. Late submissions may not receive proper consideration, especially if we receive a majority of the material at deadline. </p>
<p>Writers: Please do not send unsolicited material. Urge your publisher to send in any relevant work. Feel free to query with any questions or recommendations.</p>
<p><em>Please note</em>: Only writers whose work is selected for the volume will be contacted.</p>
<p>Physical submissions of books for consideration, and for the year in review column, can be mailed to:</p>
<p>Year’s Best Weird Fiction, 1905 Faylee Crescent, Pickering ON, L1V 2T3, Canada</p>
<h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>
<p><em><br/>Who will be editing volume 2 of Year's Best Weird Fiction?</em></p>
<p>We don't know. We have some ideas. Who would you like to see helm the next volume?</p>
<p><em>Is that the cover art?</em></p>
<p>No. But if enough people like it, we may consider it.</p>
<p><em>Can I buy the book even if I do not donate?</em></p>
<p>The book will be available through all the major online retailers via Ingram. We are exploring physical distribution, as well, and are confident it will be picked up, but our best chance of success is if you pre-purchase through this fund-raiser. </p>
<p><em>Will you still accept funds if you reach your goal?</em></p>
<p>Yes! Any monies raised above our goal will be used to fund future volumes, and to also help fund volume six of Shadows &amp; Tall Trees.</p>
<p><em>Do you ship outside the U.S.A.?</em></p>
<p>Yes! But please add $10 for shipments outside the U.S.A. and Canada.</p>
<p><em>When will I get my reward?</em></p>

Laird Barron will be editing the inaugural volume of the Year’s Best Weird Fiction for Undertow Publications.
Barron is one of finest practitioners of the weird tale. His work has been nominated for several awards, and has been reprinted in numerous “Year’s Best” anthologies.
Undertow Publications is home to the acclaimed weird journal Shadows & Tall Trees. Our first publication, Apparitions, was a Shirley Jackson Award Finalist.
 
 

 
The publishing landscape has changed. The big publishers mostly still view weird fiction as a strange and esoteric thing. In short, it isn’t seen as a viable commercial opportunity.  But we think there is a need for such a volume. That is why we are appealing to you to help fund this and future volumes of the Year’s Best Weird Fiction. All the funds will be used to pay the editor, the contributors, the designers, typesetter, printing, shipping, etc. Your money will help support what we hope will be an annual and vital volume of the best weird fiction.
Each volume of the Year’s Best Weird Fiction will feature a different editor. Weird fiction is a diverse and eclectic mode of literature, and we are excited to see varying viewpoints. In fact, we are confident that the volume will see little if any overlap with the various other “Best Of” anthologies. And we could think of no one better than Laird Barron to helm the inaugural volume.
Along with up to 100,000 words of the finest strange fiction from the previous year, each volume will include an introduction from the editor, a year in review column, and a short list of other notable stories. If we reach our funding goal, the book will be available in trade-paperback format and as DRM-free ePub and Mobi eBooks. The Year’s Best Weird Fiction, Volume 1, is slated for publication in late summer/early fall of 2014.
Crowd-funding a book is akin to pre-ordering that book. However, we do hope you’ll take advantage of some of our other great perks and rewards. We’re really excited about the Year’s Best Weird Fiction, and hope you’ll support its publication. We can’t make this happen without you.
So … welcome to the Year’s Best Weird Fiction.
What is weird fiction?
The simple answer is that it is speculative in nature, chiefly derived from pulp fiction in the early 20th century, whose remit includes ghost stories, the strange and macabre, the supernatural, fantasy, myth, philosophical ontology, ambiguity, and featuring a helping of the outré. Weird fiction, at its best, is an intersecting of themes and ideas that explore and subvert the laws of Nature. It counts among its proponents older and newer writers alike: Robert Aickman, Laird Barron, Charles Beaumont, Ambrose Bierce, Octavia Butler, Ray Bradbury, Angela Carter, Neil Gaiman, Shirley Jackson, Kathe Koja, John Langan, Thomas Ligotti, Kelly Link, H. P. Lovecraft, and many others.

Weird fiction is not specifically horror or fantasy. And weird fiction is not new. It has always been present. That’s because it isn’t a genre, as such. This makes the prospect of defining weird fiction difficult, and perhaps ill advised. Weird fiction is a mode of literature that is present in other genres. Weird tales were penned long before publishers codified and attached genre labels to fiction. You can find weird fiction in literary journals, in horror magazines, fantasy and science fiction periodicals, and various other genre and non-genre journals and anthologies that are welcoming to speculative fiction of the fantastique.
 
 
There’s been renewed interest in weird fiction, spurred by the writings of the authors mentioned above, and by the likes of Jeffrey Ford, Elizabeth Hand, Margo Lanagan, China Mieville, Reggie Oliver, Kaaron Warren, and by the publication of anthologies such as American Fantastic Tales, Black Water, Black Wings, The Weird, The Uncanny, Strange Tales; and journals such as Black Static, ChiZine, Shadows & Tall Trees, and Weird Fiction Review.
Weird fiction is here to stay. Once the purview of esoteric readers, it is enjoying wider popularity. Throughout its storied history there has not been a dedicated volume of the year’s best weird writing. There are a host of authors penning weird and strange tales that defy easy categorization. Tales that slip through genre cracks. A yearly anthology of the best of these writings is long overdue.
Submitting material for consideration
This is a reprint fiction anthology. Editor Laird Barron is only seeking material that was first published in 2013.
Publishers only are encouraged to send text files, preferably in Word, to: bestweirdfiction@gmail.com 
Physical material is also acceptable. See address below.
Deadline for all material is January 7, 2014, but sooner (much sooner) is better. Late submissions may not receive proper consideration, especially if we receive a majority of the material at deadline. 
Writers: Please do not send unsolicited material. Urge your publisher to send in any relevant work. Feel free to query with any questions or recommendations.
Please note: Only writers whose work is selected for the volume will be contacted.
Physical submissions of books for consideration, and for the year in review column, can be mailed to:
Year’s Best Weird Fiction, 1905 Faylee Crescent, Pickering ON, L1V 2T3, Canada
FAQ
Who will be editing volume 2 of Year's Best Weird Fiction?
We don't know. We have some ideas. Who would you like to see helm the next volume?
Is that the cover art?
No. But if enough people like it, we may consider it.
Can I buy the book even if I do not donate?
The book will be available through all the major online retailers via Ingram. We are exploring physical distribution, as well, and are confident it will be picked up, but our best chance of success is if you pre-purchase through this fund-raiser. 
Will you still accept funds if you reach your goal?
Yes! Any monies raised above our goal will be used to fund future volumes, and to also help fund volume six of Shadows & Tall Trees.
Do you ship outside the U.S.A.?
Yes! But please add $10 for shipments outside the U.S.A. and Canada.
When will I get my reward?
The Year's Best Weird Fiction, and Shadows & Tall Trees 6, will ship late summer/early fall 2014. If you picked another reward, it will ship in January. Tuckerizations may take some time. You'll be notified when your Tuckerization has been published.
Lastly, you can help us out by spreading the word. Please mention the campaign on your social media sites, blogs, forums, etc. Thank you.

</ul><h3>My Story</h3>
<p>It all started about few years ago in my native Latvia, one of the Baltic States in northern Europe, across the Baltic Sea from Sweden. On a bleak winter's morning in January 2008, I received an interesting e-mail from a friend I had met in a personal development training course. His intent was clearly to cheer me up. While I am usually cheerful and optimistic by nature, my mood on that gray day was not the best. I also believe that things in life usually happen for a reason.</p>
<p><br/> Here's what the e-mail said: </p>
<p> <em>   A group of professional people posed this question to a group of 4 to 8 year-olds, 'What does love mean?' The answers they got were broader and deeper than anyone could have imagined.  <br/>     “When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different. You just know that your name is safe in their mouth.”  --   Billy, age 4  <br/>       “Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your French fries without making them give you any of theirs.”  -- Chrissie, age 6</em></p>
<p><em>""Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him to make sure it tastes OK."" -- Danny, age 7</em></p>
<p><em>Author and lecturer Leo Buscaglia once talked about a contest he was asked to judge. The purpose of the contest was to find the most caring child.  <br/>      <br/> The winner was a 4-year-old whose next-door neighbor was an elderly gentleman who had recently lost his wife. Upon seeing the man cry, the little boy went into the old gentleman's yard, climbed onto his lap, and just sat there. When his Mother asked what he had said to the neighbor, the little boy replied: 'Nothing, I just helped him cry.'  <br/></em>      <br/> I remember that, after reading these children's observations about love, my mood was decidedly more up-beat for the rest of the day. What a wonderful thing!  I thought that message was worth sharing, and forwarded the email to all of my friends. </p>
<p>At the same time, an idea was born: How to actively improve my own mood and that of others in just a few short minutes. I was curious to find out how the children in my country would define love. I also wanted to know how they felt in neighboring countries and other continents all over the world. <br/> It was not my aim to seek out the most spiritual child and expound on his beliefs, but to hear the truth -- straight from the heart. The answers were not only interesting, they touched the heart and moved the spirit, just like the ones I had read in my friend's email. </p>
<h3>What Is My Book About?</h3>
<p>We interviewed children between the ages of 4 and 10, in the United States, asking the question: ""What is love?"" then chose the most interesting responses and summarized them in this book.</p>
<p>The aim of our project is to find out how the youngest members of American society define love. To do this, we have interviewed children between the ages of 4 and 10, asking the question: ""What is love?"" </p>
<p>We have selected the most interesting responses and summarized them in this book. </p>
<p>We believe that this book will result in a positive change in our lives and that the content will inspire a healthy outlook and allow more love into your day-to-day lives. This book is for people of all ages who are curious, have respect for culture and religious diversity, and whose hearts are open. </p>
<p>As a way to personalize the book for each reader, I have put blank pages at the back, where parents can put their children's photos. They could ask them the same ""Love"" question on each birthday, and note their answers as they grow and their thoughts evolve. They could save the books and present them to their children when they have grown, along with their perception of the meaning of love.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<div>
<p>If you're ready to sign up and help bring this book to publication, thanks so much - it's a real pleasure and honour having you on board as a co-creator! I'm sure it's a win-win for everyone involved, and you'll enjoy the finished product immensely.I hope you can at least help me spread the word to others who might be interested, either through email or social media, or by using the share tools provided by IndieGoGo. I truly believe that this topic deserves more serious consideration. In the end, no matter what your spiritual/religious view (or lack thereof), we should all strive to do right by others, while living life to the fullest. But if we are attempting to understand who we are, and where we are going, in the grand scale of things, it's also important that we consider the idea that our consciousness may survive death. This book will be the ultimate resource for those who want to learn more.</p>
<p>Sincerest thanks,</p>

When his Mother asked what he had said to the neighbor, the little boy replied: 'Nothing, I just helped him cry.'         I remember that, after reading these children's observations about love, my mood was decidedly more up-beat for the rest of the day. What a wonderful thing!  I thought that message was worth sharing, and forwarded the email to all of my friends. 
At the same time, an idea was born: How to actively improve my own mood and that of others in just a few short minutes. I was curious to find out how the children in my country would define love. I also wanted to know how they felt in neighboring countries and other continents all over the world.  It was not my aim to seek out the most spiritual child and expound on his beliefs, but to hear the truth -- straight from the heart. The answers were not only interesting, they touched the heart and moved the spirit, just like the ones I had read in my friend's email. 
What Is My Book About?
We interviewed children between the ages of 4 and 10, in the United States, asking the question: ""What is love?"" then chose the most interesting responses and summarized them in this book.
The aim of our project is to find out how the youngest members of American society define love. To do this, we have interviewed children between the ages of 4 and 10, asking the question: ""What is love?"" 
We have selected the most interesting responses and summarized them in this book. 
We believe that this book will result in a positive change in our lives and that the content will inspire a healthy outlook and allow more love into your day-to-day lives. This book is for people of all ages who are curious, have respect for culture and religious diversity, and whose hearts are open. 
As a way to personalize the book for each reader, I have put blank pages at the back, where parents can put their children's photos. They could ask them the same ""Love"" question on each birthday, and note their answers as they grow and their thoughts evolve. They could save the books and present them to their children when they have grown, along with their perception of the meaning of love.
Other Ways You Can Help

If you're ready to sign up and help bring this book to publication, thanks so much - it's a real pleasure and honour having you on board as a co-creator! I'm sure it's a win-win for everyone involved, and you'll enjoy the finished product immensely.I hope you can at least help me spread the word to others who might be interested, either through email or social media, or by using the share tools provided by IndieGoGo. I truly believe that this topic deserves more serious consideration. In the end, no matter what your spiritual/religious view (or lack thereof), we should all strive to do right by others, while living life to the fullest. But if we are attempting to understand who we are, and where we are going, in the grand scale of things, it's also important that we consider the idea that our consciousness may survive death. This book will be the ultimate resource for those who want to learn more.
Sincerest thanks,

<h3>Teaser (Excerpt):</h3>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">As the two women sat in the car waiting for their friend, Sharice decided there was no better place or time to find out if Nicole had given any more thought to when she was going to tell Lawrence about the baby.  She tried not to bring that subject up too often, but Nicole had had her first doctor’s appointment a week ago, and she felt that Lawrence should have had the option of being a part of that process as well.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Of course I have,” Nicole replied, sighing.  “It’s all I think about, other than the wedding.  I just keep waiting for the right time, but when is the right time to tell someone that?”</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">Recognizing that was a rhetorical question, Sharice knew better than to answer that directly.  “Well, you know he loves you.  So I am sure he will be fine when you do tell him. You’re definitely going to tell him before the wedding though, right?” </p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Of course,” she retorted, shaking her head and throwing her hands up in disbelief that Sharice would even ask her that. “Besides, I will probably be showing by then,” Nicole said, laughing, trying to lighten the mood.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Okay, okay,” Sharice said, laughing and shrugging.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">Nicole laughed a little harder and apologized for answering her so harshly, and Sharice apologized for being so inquisitive. She now realized her question had been a little invasive, but having tried to keep the pregnancy a secret had already put a strain on her relationship. So she could only imagine what keeping it from Lawrence was doing to Nicole.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal""> “You did tell Tracey what time we were coming to pick her up, right?” Nicole asked, looking at the clock.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Of course I did,” she said, pulling out her phone. Sharice welcomed the change of subject.  “No answer,” she said, shrugging.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Hmm, well her car is here,” Nicole replied, looking around the parking lot with a puzzled look on her face.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">Sharice began to unbuckle her seatbelt, preparing to get out and go inside just as she saw Tracey emerging from the building.  “There she is,” she said, sitting back. Then she saw another figure pull her back inside.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“What in the world?” Nicole asked, returning Sharice’s confused look.  “Isn’t that the doctor she was dancing with at the club?”</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Yeah. I mean, it looks like him from what I can see.” She began to strain her eyes, trying to see inside the glass doors. Her mouth dropped open, not believing what she was seeing. </p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">Nicole grabbed Sharice’s arm. “You have got to be kidding me.”</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal""> The two figures had all of a sudden become one. They were embracing and seemed to be sharing a rather passionate kiss.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“They can’t be,” Nicole said as she lowered her shades.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“I knew she had been acting weird lately, but this is on a whole other level of craziness.” </p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">As the two exited the building grinning from ear to ear, Nicole and Sharice looked at each other with blank stares.  Their minds were reeling, but neither knew what to say.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“So what do we do? What do we say?” Sharice was beginning to feel herself panic.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“We say nothing.”  Nicole threw up her hands again and began to shake her head.  “Tracey is a grown woman, and you can’t tell grown people anything.”  She waved at Tracey as she approached the car and unlocked the doors.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Grown woman my behind, Nicki.  She’s also engaged!”</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Don’t do it,” Nicole finished saying just as Tracey opened the side door.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Don’t do what?” Tracey asked as she hopped into her seat, completely oblivious to the fact that they’d seen her kissing her client.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Don’t ask why in the hell you were just kissing a man who isn’t your fiancé?”  Sharice turned around in her seat to face her cousin, whose smile had quickly faded.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Here we go,” Nicole said, leaning back and rubbing her forehead with her hand.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Sharice, for once just mind your own business!” Tracey yelled back at her.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Just tell us what’s going on with you?  Who is this guy?” Sharice knew she was pushing it, but she didn’t care.  She didn’t want to see Tracey to do something that couldn’t be undone.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal""> “He’s a client––not that it’s any of your business.”  Her tone was becoming more defensive by the second.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Since when did you start tonguing your clients?”  Sharice was concerned, but she wasn’t expressing it in a way that was making Tracey want to open up to her. </p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Sharice, chill out,” Nicole said, finally chiming in. “Tracey, we love you, and we are concerned about you. We are your family. You know you can tell us anything.”</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Well, don’t be. I just need some space right now and time to figure things out by myself.”</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Doesn’t look like you are doing a very good job at that. What if Derrick finds out?” Sharice asked.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Look, Sharice, I don’t even know why I expected you to understand.  Silly me, thinking you could feel some type of empathy for what I am going through, especially with your track record of failed relationships.”</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal""> “What is that supposed to mean?” Sharice could hear her voice beginning to rise, but at that moment, she could have cared less.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Okay, you guys, everyone just needs to take a breath and calm down.” </p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“I can’t deal with this right now,” Tracey said as she opened her car door.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Oh, no you don’t,” Nicole said, trying to stop her.  “You’ve been absent during all of the planning thus far.  And today I need both of my girls with me, so get your butt back in this car right now. I am pregnant, and I am getting married, and ya’ll are not about to wreck my nerves,” Nicole said as she slid her sunglasses back on and began to turn the keys in the ignition.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Nicole, I am really not in the mood to do this today,” Tracey said.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Well, do like you were doing a minute ago and suck it up, and get back into this car.”  Nicole knew she shouldn’t have said that, but she didn’t care anymore. Tracey was being selfish and reckless, and despite the fact she told Sharice to butt out, Sharice had a point.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Now you are riding me too!” yelled Tracey.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“No. What I am doing is trying to plan a wedding in less than three months, and you are hindering me from doing so, so get your butt back in the car.”</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Don’t know why I expected more from you two.”  Finally tired of hearing what they had to say, Tracey slammed the door behind her and stormed off in the direction of her car.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Now you wait one minute,” Nicole said, using her catlike reflexes and jumping out in pursuit of her runaway maid of honor.  “I am trying to get your cousin off your back, so don’t direct your anger and guilt toward me.”</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“And why are you in a rush to get married anyway, Nicole?  Trying to trap another one?  Is the baby even his?”  The words flew out of her mouth and stopped Nicole dead in her tracks. But that didn’t stop Tracey from ripping into Sharice, who had gotten out of the car as well.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“And as for you,” Tracey said, pointing her finger at Sharice, “if you don’t stop sabotaging your relationships because you feel badly about what happened with Charles, then you will end up alone and miserable.”  And with that, she turned her back to them and began to walk away.  “And I refuse to be the rock for either one of you when your relationships begin to fall apart!” she yelled at them as she threw her things into her car.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“That red heifer done lost her mind,” Nicole said, finding her voice again. Infuriated, she turned around and began to walk back to her truck.  Sharice followed behind her, feeling as though she’d just lost a part of herself.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">They sat in silence for what felt like hours, but in actuality only a few minutes passed before Nicole spoke, breaking the silence.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“You know that––”</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">Sharice placed her hand on top of Nicole’s, letting her know it was okay. “I know Lawrence is the father, Nicki.”</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">Nicole managed to muster up a small smile and squeezed Sharice’s hand.  “I don’t really feel up to dress shopping anymore,” she replied as she started the car again.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“I know what you mean,” Sharice said, looking out of her window at the raindrops that had begun to fall.</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal"">“Home it is then.”</p>
<p class=""ecmsonormal""> </p>

<p>Understandibly, working on a book, producing the writing, and tediously preparing such an endeavor is hard work. Hard work filled with optimism and eagerness, albeit little financial reward. The goal of raising money is to help the funding of the printing of the project, so that it can be distributed without pressure of immediately defending such a large investment.</p>
<p>Your money will aleviate up-front printing costs, and nothing more. Every penny raised will go to the printing of the project, which, due to the high-quality of the images, paper and binding will be beyond the writers means to pay up-front.</p>
<p>The perks are intended to both inspire donation, as well as begin and promote the release of the book. The books will be sold throughout independent book stores and collectives upon its release, and by chosing to donate money now you are ensuring your copy comes directly to you. All prices detailed in the perks are the prices upon release. Not only are you getting a copy of the work as soon as it comes out - you are ensuring the work comes out altogether by donating now. </p>
<p>All printing completed in Portland, Oregon by independent printers who care as much about writing and art as the writers and artists themselves. This process is about disseminating work by people who are passionate about writing, independence, and the production of creative and unique work. </p>

<h3>THE IMPACT:</h3>
<p>The impact of your donation determines both when and how this project will be completed. As noted above, every contribution will go to getting this project printed and ready for distribution.

 Story

Hello! My name is Aindrias de Staic I am a  actor/writer/musician who 
performs in theatre and film. 

I have devised my own theatre shows and films that have been successful 
at many international festivals including Edinburgh Fringe.   www.aindrias.com

 I have a great Idea for a feature film called 'The Year I got Younger' about a musician who needs to needs to find sobriety before he can really play from the heart. Its a kinda 'coming of age road movie bout an Irish musican who transforms durign a tumultuous but rewarding year backpacking accross Austrlia.' 

 It has 
already been a surprising success as a  theatre show , and short-doco but now i need 
help to get a feature script developed. 
I work w story-telling and music but  being quite dyslexic Im really lookin fwd to workin  with a script writer and typist to get this great story 
script on paper. 
As i work a lot w music, and story-telling form the oral tradition, my 
previous work has always been devised orally and not rarely written down but this 
script deserves to be written professionally as I will be working with 
other actors.



The Impact
We are planning to enter many international film festivals with
 the film and we are expecting the gain awards as we feel the story is 
very powerful, a story of sturrggle agaisnt addiction yer with a heart rendering subplot and rewareding happy but realisitic happy ending... and it will turn out to be a truly effecting film-script.

<p><em>Of all the fairy-rings in all the worlds, she walks into mine...</em></p>
<p>First of all, thanks for coming out to have a look at our book, <strong>Fae Fatales: A Fantasy Noir Anthology</strong>. Hopefully you'll find something that interests you!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> We have reached our first goal to make this happen, but this doesn't stop here. Now we'd like to commission artists to do art for each story. If we reach <strong>$2160</strong>, then we will have enough to have art for each story. See below for more details.</p>
<p>Though this is the first publication from Solarwyrm Press, we are not publishing inexperienced writers. The anthology itself was put together by Jax Goss, winner of a Highly Commended Prize in the Commonwealth Short Story Writing Competition for her short story ""Icarus"" in 2011. Several of the other writers placed highly in the online writing competition LJ Idol over the 2010-2011 season, which was made up of over 250 contestants. Sally Bell, Daniel Heichel, J.M. Templet, and Dominica Malcolm placed 2nd, 3rd, 6th and 12th respectively. These 5 writers, along with Jeremiah Murphy, also have stories published in <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Idol-Meanderings-Sophie-N-Childs/dp/1908599014/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363930013&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=idol+meanderings"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Idol Meanderings</a></em>, a book that grew out of the competition.</p>
<p>All of the stories within this anthology are previously unpublished, so you'll be getting completely new stories by each of our writers.</p>
<p>Okay, but what exactly <em>is</em> fantasy noir? Consider it the gritty side of urban fantasy. If you're a fan of urban fantasy but not really familiar with the original 1940s noir films (where the noir genre began), then you'll enjoy this collection. If you already love noir and fantasy, then you'll LOVE it.</p>
<p>We will be updating this page with additional information about the writers, and adding perks throughout the campaign, but for now, here's some extra information to get you started.</p>
<p>The ten writers are:<br/> Dominica Malcolm<br/> Everett Warren<br/> Jax Goss<br/> J.M. Templet<br/> J. Pauler<br/> M. Kate Allen<br/> Tom Trumpinski<br/> Sally Bell<br/> Jeremiah Murphy<br/> Daniel Heichel</p>
<p>Now let us tell you a bit more about some of the stories and writers you'll be reading in the book (more descriptions will follow).</p>
<p>Dominica Malcolm's story <em>Siren</em> is about a Hawaiian man being haunted by a mermaid in 1946. For a free sample of Dominica's writing, you can read <em>Bridging the Divide</em> (featuring the same mermaid in 1894), which was published at <a href=""http://www.plungemagazine.com/issue-one/short-stories/bridging-the-divide"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Plunge Magazine</a> in February. Both of these stories are set in the same universe as her upcoming novel, <em>Adrift</em>. In Dominica's ""Writer Pack"" perk, you receive a physical copy of the anthology and have the choice of having her draw a cartoon of you (samples <a href=""http://dominica.malcolm.id.au/artwork/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>) or write a 5-10 page short film screenplay dedicated to you, based on your suggestions (<a href=""http://dominica.malcolm.id.au/writing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">existing screenplays here</a>). <br/> For more information about Dominica, you can check out her <a href=""http://dominica.malcolm.id.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">web site</a> or find her on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/DominicaMalcolm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>""You don't talk aelfen royalty and hobgoblin kingpin tangled together without attracting some untoward attentions from every Tam, Dick, and Houri from Brú na Bóinne to Hy-Brasil."" And yet, that's exactly the kind of tale a certain hard-boiled PI is going to tell you all about in <em>The Hollow Man</em>, Everett A. Warren's contribution to the anthology. Everett has published ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cautionary-Fables-Warts-Everett-Warren/dp/055704877X/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cautionary Fables: Warts &amp; All</a>"", a collection of short fiction, and ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Poetry-Porch-Period-Everett-Warren/dp/1300021918/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Poetry from the Porch Period</a>"", a collection of poetry, both of which can be ordered from your bookstore of choice. You can find out more about him and read a number of Everett's works online by checking out the Writing section of his website, <a href=""http://everettawarren.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">everettawarren.com</a>.</p>
<p><em>Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight</em> is what happens when you take a Child Ballad and set it in a noir detective story. A hard boiled jaded detective, a beautiful mystery woman with a secret. And a little twist of magic. That's what you can expect from Jax Goss. Prior to this anthology, Jax published a collection of her own short stories in a book called <em>The Edge of the Map</em>. You can read some reviews of this book on <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11341192-the-edge-of-the-map?ac=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Goodreads</a>. In Jax's ""Writer Pack"" perk, you can receive a copy of both the anthology and a signed version of <em>The Edge of the Map</em>, along with a hand written custom short story, just for you, based on a prompt or character of your choice.<br/> For more information about Jax, see her <a href=""http://jaxgoss.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a> or find her on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/writerjaxgoss"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>J.M. Templet's contribution is called <em>Bleeding Ink</em>, which tells the story of love and addiction in many forms. You can find an example of her flash fiction at <a href=""http://digbatonrouge.com/article/flash-fiction-winners-2050/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dig</a>, where she won an honorable mention for her story about an actor playing a corpse. You can read more at her website; <a href=""http://jasminet.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jasminet.net</a>.</p>
<p>J.L. Pauler's <em>The Brooch</em> features a unicorn detective named Amaya, a missing brooch, a kelpie -- er, differently equestrian -- slum lord named Mavis, and a client who isn't entirely on the level. Amaya gets unexpected help in locating the missing brooch when the man accused of stealing it turns up floating in Mavis's river.</p>
<p>""I could understand where they were coming from; I’d read James M. Cain on my lunch breaks."" Sally Bell actually studied Film Noir: Style and History at university... which doesn't really mean much except that she can recite huge chunks of Double Indemnity from memory.</p>
<p>Here's a short sample of what you'll read in Jeremiah Murphy's <em>Beautiful Music</em>:<br/> “Her pout reminded me how much I ached to kiss those lips. ‘I was just being polite.’<br/> With a shrug, I admitted, ‘I guess your kind does believe in tradition.”<br/> “‘What do you mean, my kind?’<br/> “‘Sweetheart,’ I said, ‘I thought you said we weren’t going to be playing games.’<br/> She shook her head and chuckled again. ‘So,’ she asked, ‘are you going to invite me in?’<br/> “‘Not a chance.’”<br/> ***<br/> The door of Detective Beran, Private Investigator, was open to all kinds—witches, warlocks, vampires, werewolves, fairies, dragons, ghosts, and regular old people—until it closed not too long ago. But when a femme fatale comes knocking, how can you not answer?</p>
<p><strong>How long is the anthology?</strong></p>
<p>About 250 pages.</p>
<p><strong>What does your contribution go towards?</strong></p>
<p>We're asking for $1,500 to cover the costs of printing your copy, sending it to you, paying the writers for their stories, and paying someone to develop the book cover.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if the campaign doesn't reach its goal by the target date?</strong></p>
<p>It has! YAY! We are very excited, and very very happy, and super grateful to everyone who has supported us so far! </p>
<p><strong>What happens if we go over our goal?</strong></p>
<p>We're over it! So let's start talking stretch goals. :) The first thing we'd like to do is be able to commission art for the book. What I'd love is to be able to find ten artists, give each of them one story, and ask them to do a piece based on it.

Of all the fairy-rings in all the worlds, she walks into mine...
First of all, thanks for coming out to have a look at our book, Fae Fatales: A Fantasy Noir Anthology. Hopefully you'll find something that interests you!
Update: We have reached our first goal to make this happen, but this doesn't stop here. Now we'd like to commission artists to do art for each story. If we reach $2160, then we will have enough to have art for each story. See below for more details.
Though this is the first publication from Solarwyrm Press, we are not publishing inexperienced writers. The anthology itself was put together by Jax Goss, winner of a Highly Commended Prize in the Commonwealth Short Story Writing Competition for her short story ""Icarus"" in 2011. Several of the other writers placed highly in the online writing competition LJ Idol over the 2010-2011 season, which was made up of over 250 contestants. Sally Bell, Daniel Heichel, J.M. Templet, and Dominica Malcolm placed 2nd, 3rd, 6th and 12th respectively. These 5 writers, along with Jeremiah Murphy, also have stories published in Idol Meanderings, a book that grew out of the competition.
All of the stories within this anthology are previously unpublished, so you'll be getting completely new stories by each of our writers.
Okay, but what exactly is fantasy noir? Consider it the gritty side of urban fantasy. If you're a fan of urban fantasy but not really familiar with the original 1940s noir films (where the noir genre began), then you'll enjoy this collection. If you already love noir and fantasy, then you'll LOVE it.
We will be updating this page with additional information about the writers, and adding perks throughout the campaign, but for now, here's some extra information to get you started.
The ten writers are: Dominica Malcolm Everett Warren Jax Goss J.M. Templet J. Pauler M. Kate Allen Tom Trumpinski Sally Bell Jeremiah Murphy Daniel Heichel
Now let us tell you a bit more about some of the stories and writers you'll be reading in the book (more descriptions will follow).
Dominica Malcolm's story Siren is about a Hawaiian man being haunted by a mermaid in 1946. For a free sample of Dominica's writing, you can read Bridging the Divide (featuring the same mermaid in 1894), which was published at Plunge Magazine in February. Both of these stories are set in the same universe as her upcoming novel, Adrift. In Dominica's ""Writer Pack"" perk, you receive a physical copy of the anthology and have the choice of having her draw a cartoon of you (samples here) or write a 5-10 page short film screenplay dedicated to you, based on your suggestions (existing screenplays here).  For more information about Dominica, you can check out her web site or find her on Facebook.
""You don't talk aelfen royalty and hobgoblin kingpin tangled together without attracting some untoward attentions from every Tam, Dick, and Houri from Brú na Bóinne to Hy-Brasil."" And yet, that's exactly the kind of tale a certain hard-boiled PI is going to tell you all about in The Hollow Man, Everett A. Warren's contribution to the anthology. Everett has published ""Cautionary Fables: Warts & All"", a collection of short fiction, and ""Poetry from the Porch Period"", a collection of poetry, both of which can be ordered from your bookstore of choice. You can find out more about him and read a number of Everett's works online by checking out the Writing section of his website, everettawarren.com.
Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight is what happens when you take a Child Ballad and set it in a noir detective story. A hard boiled jaded detective, a beautiful mystery woman with a secret. And a little twist of magic. That's what you can expect from Jax Goss. Prior to this anthology, Jax published a collection of her own short stories in a book called The Edge of the Map. You can read some reviews of this book on Goodreads. In Jax's ""Writer Pack"" perk, you can receive a copy of both the anthology and a signed version of The Edge of the Map, along with a hand written custom short story, just for you, based on a prompt or character of your choice. For more information about Jax, see her blog or find her on Facebook.
J.M. Templet's contribution is called Bleeding Ink, which tells the story of love and addiction in many forms. You can find an example of her flash fiction at Dig, where she won an honorable mention for her story about an actor playing a corpse. You can read more at her website; jasminet.net.
J.L. Pauler's The Brooch features a unicorn detective named Amaya, a missing brooch, a kelpie -- er, differently equestrian -- slum lord named Mavis, and a client who isn't entirely on the level. Amaya gets unexpected help in locating the missing brooch when the man accused of stealing it turns up floating in Mavis's river.
""I could understand where they were coming from; I’d read James M. Cain on my lunch breaks."" Sally Bell actually studied Film Noir: Style and History at university... which doesn't really mean much except that she can recite huge chunks of Double Indemnity from memory.
Here's a short sample of what you'll read in Jeremiah Murphy's Beautiful Music: “Her pout reminded me how much I ached to kiss those lips. ‘I was just being polite.’ With a shrug, I admitted, ‘I guess your kind does believe in tradition.” “‘What do you mean, my kind?’ “‘Sweetheart,’ I said, ‘I thought you said we weren’t going to be playing games.’ She shook her head and chuckled again. ‘So,’ she asked, ‘are you going to invite me in?’ “‘Not a chance.’” *** The door of Detective Beran, Private Investigator, was open to all kinds—witches, warlocks, vampires, werewolves, fairies, dragons, ghosts, and regular old people—until it closed not too long ago. But when a femme fatale comes knocking, how can you not answer?
How long is the anthology?
About 250 pages.
What does your contribution go towards?
We're asking for $1,500 to cover the costs of printing your copy, sending it to you, paying the writers for their stories, and paying someone to develop the book cover.
What happens if the campaign doesn't reach its goal by the target date?
It has! YAY! We are very excited, and very very happy, and super grateful to everyone who has supported us so far! 
What happens if we go over our goal?
We're over it! So let's start talking stretch goals. :) The first thing we'd like to do is be able to commission art for the book. What I'd love is to be able to find ten artists, give each of them one story, and ask them to do a piece based on it. Then we could include a set of postcards with each book ordered based on the art. 
I am a big fan of paying people for their art, so I'd want to pay the artists. For each extra $66 we get, I can commission ONE ARTIST. If we get to $2160, I can commission an artist for each story, and include a set of postcards with the first 50 physical books bought. 
So that's the new goal! I'll be putting out a call for artists as soon as we hit the first $66 over the target. 
What else can you do to help?
It would be awesome if you could help us spread the word about this anthology. If it sounds like your sort of thing, then chances are you know someone else who would also like it. Post on social media, tell people directly, send them our way!",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

End of Phase One of My Campaign

</p><p>Thanks to all who've contributed to this project thus far through Indie-gogo.  Please note that there's no disappointment in the amount raised thus far, even though it's short of the more ambitious original goal. Some crowdfunding sites are all or nothing, that's not the case with this site, and all funds will come my way.  And the opportunity is still open for you to contribute through this site.

</p><p>Although I was set back a bit in the early days of this campaign by some unexpected minor crises in my life that prevented me from pulling out all of the stops in this first effort, I'm committed to moving forward with this project with more enthusiasm than ever. My list of people whose stories I hope to include has increased threefold.  And thanks to the response I've received, including pledges of significant future financial support, and some new collaborations, I believe in this project's value now more than ever.

</p><p>By this weekend, I'll be posting plans for the next phase of this project.  If you're late in seeing this, please do read on, and consider making a contribution, or helping me further spread the word. Thanks again!

But she didn't retreat into a corner.  In experiencing the pain that came with those experiences of rejection and harassment, she reasoned that it came out of a basic lack of understanding.  And, in fourth and fifth grade, she paved the way for others by designing a curriculum that showcased LGBT role models and other positive messages about our families, and she testified at legislative hearings and other public settings, sharing her family's story, and making headlines statewide and beyond.  At age 12, she spoke before a half million people on the Mall in Washington, and began to receive attention in the national media, and awards from national social justice groups.  At 13, Sol and gay community leader Callen Harty co-founded Proud Theater, an award-winning multi-cultural youth theater company, featuring original works based on its young members' lives, still going strong today.  Over the years, her activism broadened and evolved to include issues of basic civil liberties alongside civil rights, as she helped lead high school students citywide to protest government excesses in the face of 9/11, and her work has always included a strong awareness of the need to support and empower young people of color.   <br/><br/>Today, at age 27, her activism encompasses the full spectrum of social justice issues, resonant with a personal mission of finding ways to link ""art, heart, and activism.""  Her studies at Hampshire College took her to internships in the West Bank and along the US-Mexican border, and upon her return, she produced a powerful play, ""The birds that are your hands: how to start a fire under siege"" about the experiences of young people living life in the shadow of a wall.  While at Hampshire, she pioneered ways to apply dramatic techniques in ways that healed and informed people on the path to social justice.  Her work has since taken her all over the US, to the Middle East and recently to East Africa, where she therapeutically infuses art and drama in powerful ways that lift up young people and others facing trauma and prejudice. Her multi-faceted work continues at Proud Theater and multiple other venues, launching young people down the road to the realization of their greatest dreams.  Sol was recently honored on a <a href=""http://www.hlntv.com/video/2012/09/17/proud-theater-lgbtq-hln-robin-meade"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CNN Headline News feature</a> on Everyday Heroes.<br/><br/>While Sol's early story was told more than a decade ago in six books, in newspaper venues ranging from the Chicago Tribune to the Los Angeles Times, in People Magazine, on public radio, and virtually every major television network, the totality of her recent story, and how her early history has influenced her activism as an adult, has never been told in one place before.  As someone who has been ""Uncle John"" to Sol for all of her life, she's trusting me to tell that story now.<br/><br/><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: large;""><b>A Compassionate Vision for a More Sustainable World</b></span></p>

As they both cried tears of anguish, she felt a dampness coming down from her 14-year-old sister's brow, and realized that it was not her sister's tears, but her blood.  The incident shook a nation who saw it all play out on the national news.  </font></p>
<p><font size=""+1"">Dr. King came to town a short time later, joined by thousands of allies of all colors and creeds from around the US, a court order was obtained, and soon Joanne and her sister found themselves crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge on the road to Montgomery, in a march that would lead a few months later to President Johnson's signing of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 1992, she co-founded Selma's grasssroots National Voting Rights Museum to chronicle the role of ordinary people in that movement, and a few years later, she began yearly treks to Wisconsin to teach our young people about this important history.

In recent months, Lawrence had developed the only color footage of the March from film canisters that had been in storage for 40 years, which he proudly showed to us. After meeting Joanne, I was hooked, and I became part of the long history of Wisconsinites called to assist her in her important work, and had the privilege of being with her in Selma, and then Madison, as we viewed together first the nomination,then the inauguration, of this country's first African-American president.  I learned quickly, that dozens of young people have had their lives changed in knowing Ms. Bland, <a href=""https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfCivilRightsMovementTransformsYoungLivesTheMadisonToSelma_241"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">as we documented on my radio show in a tribute to the inspiring influence she's had on them</a>.<br/></font></p>

US Senator Tammy Baldwin counts her visit to Joanne's museum in the company of Georgia US Rep. John Lewis eight years ago as one of the most inspiring such visits in her life.  Joanne followed and supported developments at the WI Capitol closely, and then US Rep. Baldwin also noted this resonance of movements in a speech at the Capitol delivered on the 44th anniversary of the Selma March.  Both of their stories are told in this video I produced in March of 2011, enitled <a href=""https://vimeo.com/20749803"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Historic Resonances Between Madison and Selma</a>, juxtaposing the powerful story-telling of two women who have both been civil rights pioneers.<br/><br/></font></p>

His admonition to young people to join him on a revolution against all that is normal, is actually represents quite a serious quest.  Based today out of Santa Monica, California, his latest social venture is a social project called ""Streetcraft LA,"" which works with at risk youth, street hustlers, tag bangers, supporting them in becoming creative economy volunteers.</font></p>

End of Phase One of My Campaign

Thanks to all who've contributed to this project thus far through Indie-gogo.  Please note that there's no disappointment in the amount raised thus far, even though it's short of the more ambitious original goal. Some crowdfunding sites are all or nothing, that's not the case with this site, and all funds will come my way.  And the opportunity is still open for you to contribute through this site.

Although I was set back a bit in the early days of this campaign by some unexpected minor crises in my life that prevented me from pulling out all of the stops in this first effort, I'm committed to moving forward with this project with more enthusiasm than ever. My list of people whose stories I hope to include has increased threefold.  And thanks to the response I've received, including pledges of significant future financial support, and some new collaborations, I believe in this project's value now more than ever.

By this weekend, I'll be posting plans for the next phase of this project.  If you're late in seeing this, please do read on, and consider making a contribution, or helping me further spread the word. Thanks again!

One Person Can Still Make a Difference.  Coming Together in a Spirit of Supportive Community, We Can Do Even More.Please support my new book, ""Voices of Conscience and Courage.""Please consider a donation of $5, $10, $25 or more as you read on!
My name is John Quinlan.  I'm a Madison, Wisconsin-based writer, historian, civil rights advocate, community activist, and radio show host. I've met and interviewed countless amazing dedicated folks working on the cutting edge of social change, and I'm writing to ask for your help in bringing their inspiring voices to a larger audience.  I believe that it's the underlying life stories of ordinary people that move and inspire people to action, and that reveal the interconnections of all of the great movements for social justice.This book, an anthology of remarkable life stories, represents a powerful way to get those deeper stories out into the world, as a means of inspiring others to action.
Storytelling that evokes the courage and integrity of principled individuals has always been one of the most powerful forces for social change.  And when I interview someone, it's just as important for me to find out why someone does what they do, as it is to explain what it is they've done.  A few examples of those people whose stories will be told in this book are featured below.  Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to interview and come to know some amazing people who’ve had the courage to reach deep inside themselves to do the right thing. 
Some are folks who’ve shared difficult life stories, so that others can achieve understandings that will turn back stigma. 
Others are people who’ve had the courage to speak out on matters of principle, in defense of human rights or democracy, even in a climate of fear that puts them at great risk. 
Some are storytellers themselves willing to take the steps necessary give voice to people long denied a voice, even if it makes them vulnerable to criticism or physical harm. 
Others are folks whose perseverance and imagination have helped drive and sustain the movements for civil rights, women’s rights, disability rights, and LGBT rights. 
Some are spiritual leaders willing to put their faith into action. 
Then there folks who are unafraid to stand up to the powers-that-be in their defense of the environment. 
Still others have advocated for commonsensical political reform and the communitarian role that is the realm of good government, at the risk of being blacklisted and ridiculed, or being told what they want is not in keeping with the popular will of the moment.

Social change does not come easily, but these are folks willing to persevere, become personally vulnerable, and weather hardship on the path to justice, despite the conventional wisdom that they can't succeed.  On the one hand, they're a pretty extraordinary group of people.  On the other hand, these are ordinary people, not all that different than you and me.  What they can do, we can do, too.
Wisconsin Capitol, February 2011                                             Photos: Callen Harty
Three years ago this month, hundreds of thousands of ordinary people from all over Wisconsin, and all walks of life, came to their state capitol in support of quality education, workers' rights, and open government in the face of the destructive and undemocratic actions of a newly-elected governor.  Some of my stories are those of people connected to this movement, as I explore with them the life stories that led the individuals behind this movement to take such a courageous stand, and where their experiences have taken them since.The connections between my book and the 2011 and 2012 Wisconsin Uprising is described here, in the Voices of Conscience and Courage blog.   But, as noted above, the stories I'm hoping to tell span a much broader range of issues and time, and involve people of many different ages and backgrounds.  Most stories are rooted here in Wisconsin, but play themselves out across the nation and the world.The obstacles facing people of conscience and courage are daunting.  In every major movement for social justice, it's always been this way.  However, we can draw hope, even when we're being bombarded with messages that tell us that there's no hope.  As so many of us learned in the context of the Wisconsin Uprising, we need to counter short-sighted and distorted media messages by being the catalyst for alternative storytelling of an authentic kind.We were reminded last year in celebrating the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington, people who put their beliefs into action, who have the courage and strength to persevere, do make a difference over time.  Such are the lessons of history made by folks who've lived and still live among us.  Such will be the lesson of the Wisconsin Uprising, and such will be the path we take as a nation and a world if we simply keep building on all we've done, and resolving to creatively keep doing it.This is the kind of multi-faceted storytelling I'm taking on with this book, based on my strengths as an interviewer skilled in the art of giving people a comfortable space in which to tell their own stories, and the insights that have come with several decades of my own activism.  It bears repeating:  in these times, we need and deserve to be inspired by the words and deeds of others.  It's times like these when it's now more important than ever for people of conscience and courage to reach out to each other as a means of finding new and innovative ways to make our voices heard.  That's what this book is all about--giving some ordinary yet ultimately extraordinary people a forum in which they can tell their own life stories.  As you can see by my bio, that's long been a focus of my own work. 

As you'll see from some of the examples of people who'll I'll be writing about below (a list that's by no means complete, and is growing every day), there are a lot of largely untold stories to tell, that I hope will inspire folks to make a difference themselves.However, I can't do it without your help.Please consider a donation of $5, $10, $25 or more.  (Larger donations will also reserve you a copy of the book.)  Please scroll down to the bottom of this page for an easy way to donate via credit card or paypal.I'd also appreciate your help in getting out the word by sharing this page with your friends in the social media.With your help, these efforts will form the foundation for a much larger and sustainable multimedia public education campaign--reminding folks of all that they can do, working individually and in supportive community--for many years to come....  Please consider using sending a donation today via the link at the top of the page, where you can contribute via credit card or paypal.  Working together, we can make a difference!Pictured just outside our community radio studio with my longtime friend and colleague, Charlie Daniel, recipient of both the city of Madison's ML King Award, and its James C. Wright Human Rights Award.  Like many of those whose stories will be featured in my book, her activism has spanned multiple issues, including civil rights, LGBT rights, and culturally competent health strategies for communities of color.  In particular, her outspoken leadership in creating support for LGBT youth of color has had a powerful effect in our community.  Ten years ago, I shared this memorable radio conversation with Charlie (edited down to five minutes), reflective of her belief in young people, and the affinity and passion she feels for them.

Immediately below are three representative examples of some of the individuals who will be featured in the book, folks who've been of all generations, and from a diversity of backgrounds and cultures, working on issues of racial and economic justice, LGBT rights, women's rights, disability rights, the environment, and much, much more. Embracing, Art, Heart, and Activism: Giving Voice to Our YouthWhen Sol Kelley-Jones was 10-years-old back in 1997, she was among the first children of lesbian and gay parents in Madison, Wisconsin's schools.  It wasn't always easy.  She was taunted by some, and also physically harassed, including being pushed down the stairs at her school. But she didn't retreat into a corner.  In experiencing the pain that came with those experiences of rejection and harassment, she reasoned that it came out of a basic lack of understanding.  And, in fourth and fifth grade, she paved the way for others by designing a curriculum that showcased LGBT role models and other positive messages about our families, and she testified at legislative hearings and other public settings, sharing her family's story, and making headlines statewide and beyond.  At age 12, she spoke before a half million people on the Mall in Washington, and began to receive attention in the national media, and awards from national social justice groups.  At 13, Sol and gay community leader Callen Harty co-founded Proud Theater, an award-winning multi-cultural youth theater company, featuring original works based on its young members' lives, still going strong today.  Over the years, her activism broadened and evolved to include issues of basic civil liberties alongside civil rights, as she helped lead high school students citywide to protest government excesses in the face of 9/11, and her work has always included a strong awareness of the need to support and empower young people of color.   Today, at age 27, her activism encompasses the full spectrum of social justice issues, resonant with a personal mission of finding ways to link ""art, heart, and activism.""  Her studies at Hampshire College took her to internships in the West Bank and along the US-Mexican border, and upon her return, she produced a powerful play, ""The birds that are your hands: how to start a fire under siege"" about the experiences of young people living life in the shadow of a wall.  While at Hampshire, she pioneered ways to apply dramatic techniques in ways that healed and informed people on the path to social justice.  Her work has since taken her all over the US, to the Middle East and recently to East Africa, where she therapeutically infuses art and drama in powerful ways that lift up young people and others facing trauma and prejudice. Her multi-faceted work continues at Proud Theater and multiple other venues, launching young people down the road to the realization of their greatest dreams.  Sol was recently honored on a CNN Headline News feature on Everyday Heroes.While Sol's early story was told more than a decade ago in six books, in newspaper venues ranging from the Chicago Tribune to the Los Angeles Times, in People Magazine, on public radio, and virtually every major television network, the totality of her recent story, and how her early history has influenced her activism as an adult, has never been told in one place before.  As someone who has been ""Uncle John"" to Sol for all of her life, she's trusting me to tell that story now.A Compassionate Vision for a More Sustainable World


Soon after Gene and Linda Farley had been married and both had become doctors in the 1950s, they moved with their young family from upstate New York to the Navajo Nation, where they helped bring medical care to thousands. They took what they learned, and, upon their return to New York, Gene took steps that led to the founding of the discipline of ""family medicine,"" a holistic medical approach that brings in family and community as partners on the path to healing now practiced by over 100,000 doctors worldwide.  In 1963, they took the life-changing step of attending the March on Washington, reaffirming a lifelong commitment to racial and economic justice.  Their love for one another was inseparable from their love of the Earth and all of its inhabitants, and in recent years, they founded the Farley Center for Peace, Justice and Sustainability as a means of promoting good health, sustainable and health food practices, and a spirit of stewardship toward the Earth.  Linda left us four years ago and Gene in early November, and hundreds of folks came together recently at the celebration of Gene's life to mark the difference they'd made in our lives.  Click here for a link to an essay I wrote about Gene in the Madison Times, and click here for a link to a special radio show tribute I produced honoring Gene and Linda back in November.Teaching Younger Generations Why Voting Rights Matter
While she may have grown up knowing and learning from Dr. King, for whom she has great respect, Joanne Bland also knows that it was ordinary children and women like herself who formed the foundation of the black civil rights movement.  When she was was 11, she and her teenage sister experienced firsthand the carnage of Bloody Sunday, in the context of the 1965 Selma to Montgomery March for voting rights.  At that young age, she'd already been arrested 13 times for civil disobedience.  Initially facing down violent Alabama troupers by standing their ground with non-violence, she and her 14-year-old sister found themselves retreating to a nearby car amidst the bloody aftermath of the day's events. As they both cried tears of anguish, she felt a dampness coming down from her 14-year-old sister's brow, and realized that it was not her sister's tears, but her blood.  The incident shook a nation who saw it all play out on the national news.  
Dr. King came to town a short time later, joined by thousands of allies of all colors and creeds from around the US, a court order was obtained, and soon Joanne and her sister found themselves crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge on the road to Montgomery, in a march that would lead a few months later to President Johnson's signing of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.  In 1992, she co-founded Selma's grasssroots National Voting Rights Museum to chronicle the role of ordinary people in that movement, and a few years later, she began yearly treks to Wisconsin to teach our young people about this important history. In turn, dozens of these Wisconsin young people have followed Joanne down South, where they were a vital force in building her museum.  




I first met Joanne on a trip to Selma in August 2006 with my friend, the
 Rev. Darrell Richey (at left in back row in photo), where we assisted with oral history projects and 
where I broadcast a live three hour version of my show from her museum.  There, in addition to Joanne, we met other Selma veterans, like Lawrence and Dorothea Huggins, who'd been teachers at the time of the March. In recent months, Lawrence had developed the only color footage of the March from film canisters that had been in storage for 40 years, which he proudly showed to us. After meeting Joanne, I was hooked, and I became part of the long history of Wisconsinites called to assist her in her important work, and had the privilege of being with her in Selma, and then Madison, as we viewed together first the nomination,then the inauguration, of this country's first African-American president.  I learned quickly, that dozens of young people have had their lives changed in knowing Ms. Bland, as we documented on my radio show in a tribute to the inspiring influence she's had on them.
Today, in this era of renewed race-based voter suppression and a recent Supreme Court decision that gutted the Voting Rights Act, Joanne's fight continues. US Senator Tammy Baldwin counts her visit to Joanne's museum in the company of Georgia US Rep. John Lewis eight years ago as one of the most inspiring such visits in her life.  Joanne followed and supported developments at the WI Capitol closely, and then US Rep. Baldwin also noted this resonance of movements in a speech at the Capitol delivered on the 44th anniversary of the Selma March.  Both of their stories are told in this video I produced in March of 2011, enitled Historic Resonances Between Madison and Selma, juxtaposing the powerful story-telling of two women who have both been civil rights pioneers.
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.

Here are some other folks whose stories I'll be previewing for you, in days to come in the Voices of Conscience and Courage blog:

Inspiring Others on the Path to Peace and Justice
  Former State Rep. Midge Miller is a political folk hero in her home state of Wisconsin, but the national role she played as a feminist leader and peace advocate may be less well-known.  As I learned on a special memorial edition of my radio show, as an advocate for women's rights, she was a contemporary of Friedan, Steinem, and Abzug, and her Madison colleague, NOW co-founder, Kathryn Clarenbach.  As an advocate for peace, she convinced her good friend, Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy, to run for president in 1968 as a means of advancing a peaceful solution in Vietnam. The candidacy that she spearheaded is widely seen as the development that caused President Lyndon Johnson not to run for another term.  
Throughout a distinguished career in the state legislature alongside colleagues like Mary Lou Munts and later Rebecca Young, she helped revitalize the WI Democratic party as a force for social justice.  In later years, her work with the Madison Institute, the WI Network for Peace and Justice, and in other realms formed the foundation for a lasting legacy.  Shortly before she passed away in 2009 after a courageous fight with cancer, her daughter-in-law recorded almost a dozen hours of videotaped interviews with her that have not yet been shared with the public.  Midge's son Mark (whose work is described below) has given me permission to use these interviews as a basis for a chapter in my book, and this will be the catalyst for efforts to share the tapes themselves more widely.  Eventually, we'd like to expand this project to include the stories of other politically active women who left their mark on Madison and the nation.  Again, your generous support will help to make this happen!

Young Photographer's Amazing Work Inspires 
Awareness and Action
  While 22-year-old Jenna Pope's activism is evocative of the powerful politicization of young women and men that occurred in the wake of the 2011 and 2012 protest at the Wisconsin Capitol, her motivation for becoming involved in rooted in the legacy of two earlier generations.  She first decided to march, and then live in the US Capitol, out of her love and respect for her mother, a lifelong teacher in her hometown of Edgerton.  Very quickly, her burgeoning talents as a photographer took wing, and her photos became some of the most personally compelling and evocative of the Capitol protests. She was a frequent guest on my radio show, as documented in this special video edition here. Her mother was immensely proud of her work, and saw it expand to Jenna's award-winning coverage of Occupy Wall Street and other protest movements worldwide. Two years ago, Jenna experienced the loss of both her mother and her beloved grandmother in the space of a few short weeks.  With the support of her father and other family members, she has transformed her grief into a new resolve to use her photographs and dispatches as a means of educating people about the nature of social justice protests around the world, including trips this past summer to Turkey's Taksim Square.  
This fall, she launched a crowdfunding project on Indiegogo, raising almost $20,000 for her new book ""Jenna Pope: An Activist Armed with a Camera,"" due out later this month.  See JennaPope.com .  Both Jenna and I are blessed with hundreds and hundreds of folks who follow our work on Facebook and elsewhere, as activist-journalists.  Jenna's success is part of what encouraged me to think outside of the box and find a way to make this book project self-sustaining.  Please believe me in me, too, and consider making a contribution!
A Cultural Translator Paving the Way for Latino LGBT People
  Since moving to Madison from his native Ecuador in 2002, Diego Campoverde-Cisneros has made a major mark on our community as both a broadcaster at La Movida, Madison's Spanish-language radio station, and in his work in the larger community.  A leader in efforts to create community for LGBT people of color, he is a co-founder of Alianza Latina, an LGBT support group.  In 2013, he received the ""Alix Olson Social Justice Award,"" named after a highly-respected longtime openly lesbian Madison police detective, presented by STAJOH, the coalition she co-founded to counter hate crimes and hate groups locally. As Alix herself noted, it was a fitting honor for this young man who has done so much to build bridges and increase understandings in our community.

There is No Normal:  Honoring Cognitive Diversity   Unlike some of the other people who's stories I'll be telling, Jonathan Mooney is not from Wisconsin, although he has spent extensive time as a consultant working with the University of Wisconsin-Madison's School of Education.  More than almost anyone else I've had the privilege of interviewing over the years, my conversations with Jonathan moved me in ways that continue to give me almost daily personal insights, and further inform my world view.  He's the author of ""The Short Bus: A Journal Beyond Normal.""Saddled with the labels ""ADHD"" and ""dyslexia"" at an early age, Jonathan at 13 was a special ed student who still couldn't read.  And yet, less than a decade later, he received an English Lit degree from  prestigious Brown University, graduating with honors.  His journey might have stopped there, self-defined as how he had overcome all of the shortcomings and failures of his younger self.  But instead, a few years later, Jonathan embarked on an incredible odyssey of discovery--traveling cross-country, in a short bus, no less--as a means of meeting other young people coping with the challenges and unfair judgements that come with labels connected with cognitive and emotional disability, not unlike his 13-year-old younger self.  Expecting at first to be in a position to provide these young people with comfort and insights, instead, he discovered that it was these young people who had so much to teach him.  Soon he learned that the key to his own self-realization was not to reject his younger self, but to embrace who he was at the core of his being.His book has particular resonance with young people who have been labeled as developmentally disabled or extremely gifted, who just don't fit into the ""one-size-fits-all"" approach adopted by many schools, but it also has lessons for us all.  Among the memorable truths Jonathan imparts is that it's usually ""dysteachia,"" not dyslexia, that lies at the root of young person's challenges.  He is an advocate for our society's embrace of the concept of ""cognitive diversity,"" with broad implications for its importance as a new way of viewing individual rights, and weighing the horrible consequences when we attempt to establish arbitrary standards for what constitutes ""normal.""  A definition of disability can often be reframed and reconsidered as part of the richness of the diversity of human experience, with worth beyond measure.  Aside from its applications in terms of creativity, it also has more practical applications.  For example, a recent study revealed that more than 60 percent of the student body of M.I.T.  could be considered to be ""learning disabled,"" by testing standards that ignore the value of individual difference.Jonathan has become an inspirational speaker and educational consultant who has touched thousands of lives through his work.  Never one to take himself too seriously, his narratives contain a playful and highly irreverent element that's ultimately endearing. His admonition to young people to join him on a revolution against all that is normal, is actually represents quite a serious quest.  Based today out of Santa Monica, California, his latest social venture is a social project called ""Streetcraft LA,"" which works with at risk youth, street hustlers, tag bangers, supporting them in becoming creative economy volunteers.
Have You Been to Jail for Justice:  Taking a Stand   Damon Terrell, president of the Autonomous Solidarity Organization, was an active participant in the Wisconsin Protests.  Singled out and brutally arrested in August 2013 by the Capitol police while participating in the Solidarity Singalong, the police's excesses were captured on videotape.  He endured jail and the threat of a felony prosecution for the cause he believed in.  Still he had to ask himself:  why did the police choose to single him out?Standing on Principle Even in a Time of Fear
       While serving on the Madison School Board in the days immediately following 9/11, Bill Keys refused to bend to the will of the mob in refusing to force students to say the Pledge of Allegiance.  It's one of many stands of conscience he and his wife Linda have taken over the years for countless causes, including mental health consumer rights, racial and economic justice, and LGBT rights.  I met Bill and Linda as they did tireless service on a powerful and broad coalition that came together to persuade the local United Way to discontinue funding the Boy Scouts as along as they continued to discriminate against gay Scouts and gay Scout leaders.  Here he stands in front of a Hmong wall hanging at a benefit for Kasjiab House, a group founded to alleviate the trauma facing Hmong elders as a resonant result of the Vietnam War.
A History-Making Nurse Who Educates and Spreads UnderstandingsBarbara Nichols's history-making firsts include being the first African-American woman to serve as the head of the National Nurse's Association, and the first African-American woman to serve as a member of the governor's cabinet.  In recent years, she's traveled the world recruiting international healthcare workers for needed positions in the US.  As a result, she has a remarkable range of insights about the professional and multi-culturally competent management of organizations in the private, public and nonprofit sectors, particularly in the area of healthcare. While officially retired, she's a speaker in much demand at colleges and universities across the country, who have given her almost a dozen honorary degrees over the years.  She currently serves as the president of the Dane County chapter of the UN Association-USA.
Living Out the Cause of PeaceJoseph and Joann Elder are community treasures, with a long history of action on behalf of the creation of a peace-filled world, resonant with their Quaker faith.  In addition to distinguished service for sixty years as a UW Sociology and South Asian faculty member, he has mediated disputes in venues like Vietnam and Afghanistan.  She has advised countless young people as the longtime advisor for the Sociology Department, and helped to found the local chapter of PFLAG (Parents, Family and Friends of LGBT people).  Together they serve on countless community boards and UW committees.  Look for my article in an upcoming dispatch in the Voices of Conscience and Courage blog. 
Faith in Action Means Being Willing to Put It All on the Line   Gene Matthews is a longtime friend of my father, who met him at the airport in Seoul, South Korea 60 years ago as they both embarked on a short term Methodist missions program.  In recent years, he's also become one of my best friends, and favorite people.  While he had met me as an infant, I next saw Gene almost fifty years later, just following my father's death in June 2010, and he gave me countless insights into my father's path as a young man.  Gene married his wife Insook and remained in South Korea until retirement, joining a group of missionaries of diverse faiths in standing up to brutally oppressive military regimes, risking death, imprisonment and deportation.  A culmination of this work was their support of eight men who'd been wrongly accused of treason, and then summarily executed.  They were allied with human rights advocate Kim Dae Jung--himself the near victim of several assassination attempts--who eventually became president of South Korea in 1997.  Gene and George Ogle (another missionary friend of my dad's, who earned both his master's and doctoral degrees at the University of Wisconsin) were invited to to the new president's inaugural, and then were given one of South Korea's highest honors for their courageous human rights work.  All of this is chronicled in a remarkable book called ""More Than Witnesses,"" for which I produced a special event at the October 2010 Wisconsin Book Festival.  See this blog I created, that chronicles the event, the story behind it, and the media associated with it.  
Promoting Social Justice and CommunityGladis Benavides (left) is a close friend and colleague, who has become like family to me.  Born in Brazil, and raised in Peru on a ranch located just a short hike from Macchu Picchu, her ancestors included a Peruvian president, and her father was a former mayor of Lima.  As a teen she attended the Sorbonne, briefly lived in Morocco, and then at 19, she moved to Madison.  Soon becoming a single mother of two, her life circumstances were considerably different than those she'd grown up with, but she loved her new home and her new friends, and was determined to make life in Madison work.  Over many years, she honed her skills as a tireless advocate--becoming a highly-respected state and municipal employee in the field of equal opportunity, and then an accomplished workplace trainer and consultant--helping organizations to become culturally competent, how to understand and observe equal opportunity laws, and how to avoid workplace conflict. She is a respected truthspeaker on matters of racial and economic justice, and it's been my privilege to work closely with her in recent years.  Few people I know epitomize as she does the notion of being a voice of conscience and courage.Barbara McKinney (right) moved to Madison from St. Louis to take care of her beloved son Mike, who died eight years ago.  Mike McKinney was a TV anchor universally respected both for his integrity as a journalist and his tireless community service, in particular his work on behalf of the Second Harvest Food Bank, and AIDS Network.  Barbara elected to stay in Madison, and she soon became the associate director of the Madison Urban Ministry.  Though known at first as ""Mike's mom,"" Barbara quickly became a respected leader in her own right in the area of restorative justice, and for her tireless work on behalf of numerous community boards.    
San Franciscan's Storytelling and Activism Knows No Bounds Joanie Juster lives in San Francisco, but is considered by many to be an honorary Wisconsinite.  Less than a week after the onset of protests at the Wisconsin Capitol, she'd purchased a one way ticket to Madison and was living amidst the diverse group of citizens who occupied the Capitol.  She first became familiar with Wisconsin while doing research for an award-winning documentary film entitled ""Alaska Far and Away,"" which airs periodically on PBS stations nationwide.  The film chronicles the migration of Upper Midwesterners during the Great Depression to the Matanuska Valley of Alaska, seeking a better life.  Joanie has a long history of working on behalf of social justice, and is an esteemed ally of the Bay Area's LGBT community.  Her activism includes being an early supporter of the NAMES Project Quilt, where she worked closely with her good friend Cleve Jones (founder of the Quilt, and an early associate of Harvey Milk.)  During a recent display of the Quilt on the National Mall in DC, Joanie was interviewed by Smithsonian Institution researchers about its early history.  Her current project is a film on the life of Sister Simone Campbell.  Joanie has returned to Wisconsin several times in recent years.  While disappointed in the outcome of the June 2012 recall election, she believes that the citizens who came together in protest will eventually prevail.  And she'll be right there, standing beside us.


Love Conquers All

Mark Miller and Jo Oyama-Miller have long worked together as a team on behalf of social justice.  (Mark is the son of Midge Miller, mentioned above, and Jo is a second generation Japanese-American whose family was sent to internment camps in World War II.)  Married in 1968 just following the Supreme Court's ""Loving v. Virginia"" case, which struck down the prohibition in many southern states against interracial marriage, they first lived in Selma, where Mark was stationed as an Air Force pilot.  In a memorable 2006 interview on my radio show, Mark explained how that personal experience had made him realize that ""two people who love each other should never be denied the right of marriage.""  
As a leader in the State Senate, Mark was one of 14 Democratic senators to leave the state as a means of delaying passage of draconian bills without process by their GOP counterparts.  Jo has a long history of community service, including her tenure at the Community Action Coalition. They, too, have long been voices of conscience and courage in Madison.




The Compassionate Critic
                  

In March of 2006, I interviewed Roger Ebert, in the context of the Wisconsin Film Festival.  it was one of the last interviews he would conduct before losing his voice during cancer surgery a short time later.  Despite this, the highly-principled Ebert found other ways to express himself, and continued to be a prolific writer until his death last year.  On this occasion, we had a spirited discussion about the history of the depiction of LGBT community leaders in film.  Our conversation was resonant with his overall belief, Infused throughout Ebert's film criticism, that this powerful medium can overcome its shortcomings, and be a powerful force for social change.   Roger Ebert is one of a handful of ""famous"" people I'll be covering in my book.  However, I strongly believe that he belongs here as someone who understood the responsibility that comes with notoriety, and who remained an accessible and compassionate advocate for all human beings throughout his lifetime.


Transforming A LIfe of Challenge into the Promise of a Better Life for OthersKaren Ott Avery, who passed away unexpectedly in late October of last year at the age of 51, was one of my dearest friends.  She'd faced an unimaginably difficult childhood,  and she was forced to live on her own at age 12. In becoming a single mom at age 16, she resolved that her own children would have a better life, and she delivered on that promise.  ""Transformative"" is a word that describes her well, as someone who took difficult and sometimes painful life lessons and made them into something life-giving and empowering of others facing resonant struggles.  When I first got to know her, she was in her mid-20s, a mature and wise young woman, who was an effective leader of our newly-formed Fair Housing Council (where she was director, and I was board president).  The friendship grew strong over the years.  She was someone whose enthusiasm was infectious, whose sense of humor was generously applied, and who knew how to bring out the best in everyone she was around.  She worked tirelessly for racial justice at both our council and Milwaukee Fair Housing.  In 1998, she became the associate director of the large Milwaukee disability rights agency, Independence First.  She spoke out often about her own experiences with emotional disability, and helped found the Grassroots Empowerment Project, an agency that provides a framework of support for mental health consumers statewide. Karen never wanted to be the center of attention in the public eye, but nonetheless, she inspired others through her tireless and facilitative leadership. She was a great friend, as hundreds of folks affirmed at her memorial service through countless stories of how she'd made a difference in our lives.  Karen's last year of life was extremely rough for her, as resonant traumas from her childhood and youth came back to haunt her, and her physical health began deterioriating.  She is at peace now, and her legacy lives on in the lives of her beloved family, and the countless friends whose lives she's touched.It's in Karen's memory that I dedicate this book.

 And so, in conclusion, we return to that important question of what one person can do, and how we find the courage to do it.The African American science fiction writer Octavia Butler, writing about her history-making friend Shirley Chisholm, wrote: ""The idea is that people are fearless, and that's why they're taking action.  I think that it's more important to realize that they're terrified, and they're still taking action, that they know exactly what they're risking, and they still risk it.""Below:  Callen Harty had a deep-seated fear of singing in public.  But early in 2011, he began a tradition of journeying to the cavernous Rotunda of the WI State Capitol, and proudly belting out a powerful solo rendition of ""We Shall Overcome."" It was an ongoing means of supporting the pro-workers' rights, pro-education, pro-democracy movement taking place there.  He was afraid, but he simply put one foot in front of the other and made it happen.  Callen's is among dozens of stories of people working for social change that will be told in my new book, ""Voices of Conscience and Courage.""Please considering supporting this effort in any way you can, through your financial contribution, or by helping spread the word.   Thanks!",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

The organization has established a successful model for developing eye clinics that is sustainable and places emphasis on empowering local economies and health care systems. Rather than sending Western eye doctors to a developing community to provide eye care for a short 2-week mission trip, Vision for the Poor works with local eye doctors and their staff with the goal that the eye clinic will be self-sustaining within 3 years of opening its doors. This method has proven more cost effective and successful in providing longer-term care for local people.Our goal:This crowd-funding campaign is just part of our fundraising strategy. We have set our crowd-funding goal at $10,000 to supplement our larger goal of $50,000, and your contribution helps us to reach that goal as a group. If we reach this mark, this amount will provide 250 sight-restoring eye surgeries for children who visit the clinics. Children under the age of 14 receive free care at the clinics as a result of the contributions of people like you who support climbers like us.The Impact:Imagine this: $200 dollars will allow another person to SEE. That's right, your contribution of two-hundred dollars will provide sight to another person who would otherwise live their life in darkness. Sight is more than just the ability to see the world, it's also a ticket into a profitable job, the ability to live independently and raise a family, and the option and opportunity to move oneself out of a state of poverty.Ways You Can HelpWe know that not everyone can give $200, but we are asking for your support in any way you feel comfortable. Here is what your contribution can provide:
1/2 penny per foot    = $97         = 1/2 sight-restoring surgery
1 penny per foot       = $194       = 1 surgery
2 cents per foot         = $388       = 2 surgeries
5 cents per foot         = $970       = 5 surgeries
10 cents per foot       = $1,940    = 10 surgeries
25 cents per foot       = $4,850    = 25 surgeries
$1.00 per foot            = $19,400  = anesthesia equipment at a new Vision for the Poor eye clinic",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><span><b>Story of My Book </b></span></p>
<p><i>Las locas (the madwomen) </i>is a book about the effects that the Dirty War in Argentina has had and continues to have on families, even today in 2020.<br/><br/>My name is Kaleigh Garraffa and I am the author of <i>Las locas (the madwomen)</i>. I wrote this book because I was inspired from a Latin American film class I took my sophomore year of college. We delved into the tragic story about how thousands of women and children went missing from being harmed or killed by the dictators in the 1970’s, causing many newborns and young kids to be left without parents.</p>
<p><br/>The terrifying reality that these tragic crimes and murders were committed  by government officials struck a chord of both inspiration and horror. How are people capable of such wicked acts? Are human beings really all inherently good? After learning about the Dirty War, a spark ignited in me: I knew this would be the background of my first mystery book.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the tragedy of the Dirty War’s effect on individuals and families. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with themes such as strong, powerful women, the power of family, and the dark, terrifying scope of humanity found in the mystery genre. I hope <i>Las Locas </i> helps you escape from the mundanities of everyday reality, and learn alongside the characters Catalina, Rosa, and Magdalena about the importance of relationships, spirituality, and creative outlets such as art, tarot reading, cooking, or wine connoisseurship.</p>
<p><i>Las locas (the madwomen)</i> takes place in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and follows the stories and perspectives of Catalina: a middle aged artist with dead parents and insecurities that she hides behind using a paint brush, Rosa: an elderly psychic who has suffered and survived grief far too many times, and Magdalena: a cold, materialistic mother living with unthinkable guilt, as well as an affinity for expensive wine and showing off to others.<br/><br/>After Catalina’s parents’ death, her world gets turned upside down as she digs into their past. Was she really their daughter? What secrets were they hiding? Were they really so dark that they were willing to die for them? Rosa has searched for her stolen grand-daughter for over 30 years and is getting closer and closer to finding her, thanks to her psychic abilities and internet savvy daughter. Magdalena’s world differs from both Catalina’s and Rosa’s. Her sheltered and white porcelain home screams perfection and materialism, but her hidden regrets and yearning for more in life scream sorrow and remorse. Through the merge of these three worlds, heartbreak, love, loss, joy, guilt, bittersweet reunions and goodbyes echo through the lives of the characters.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are a mystery fan, are interested in Tarot reading and other divination tools that connect us to the spiritual world, or want to learn more about a crucial moment in Argentinian history.<br/><br/><i>Las locas (the madwomen) </i>speaks to the Argentinian and other Latin American communities and feminists who want to grapple with Argentinian history and women empowerment in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that<i> Las locas (the madwomen) </i>inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>How far would I be willing to achieve my deepest desires?</li>
<li>How do our family values manifest themselves in our relationships?</li>
<li>Are human beings really capable of such evil?</li>
</ul>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing the Dirty War, women empowerment, and family values will change us all for the better.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>American Football: The Future of Soccer in the United States.<br/><br/>My name is Aidan Chapman and I am the author of American Football: The Future of Soccer in the United States. I wrote this book because Soccer has been one of the only aspects of my life that has kept me consistently motivated. I love the sport as a fan and as an ex-player. Now it is time for me to grow affection for the sport as a writer as well. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will begin to understand why American Soccer has failed thus far, and how it will be revived. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for Soccer in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you see into the way I perceive the world and learn about soccer from a completely new lens.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about Soccer and its affiliation within the United States:</p>
<p>How teams like Chattanooga Football Club have arranged their value to mimic European Sports</p>
<p>How the Global Soccer Community operates</p>
<p>How the United States can and should adjust their system in order to cohere with the wider footballing world</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in Soccer and how sports are effected by the world around them.<br/>American Football: The Future of Soccer in the United States is a non-fiction book that speaks to Soccer Fans and Proponents of American Advancement who are looking at Soccer and How the United States work together for the first time.</p>
<h2>The Book - American Football: The Future of Soccer in the United States</h2>
<p><br/>The book is written in 5 Parts....<br/><br/>In part 1, you will learn about the history of global soccer specifically within the United States and in Great Britain as well on the continent of Europe as a whole.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains my personal story with American soccer, which is one of the most unique stories in the entire book.<br/><br/>Part 3 is all about what American soccer at a larger scale is like. The part includes stories ranging from players like Christian Pulisic and Carlos Tevez, to how the pay-to-play system has been set up to work.<br/><br/>Part 4 is centered around the stories of clubs and people who have used the less traveled path when it comes to American Soccer. They have set up their teams and clubs to run in way that might seem contrary to Major League Soccer or other popular American sports leagues. It includes exclusive interviews with both Sheldon Grizzle from Chattanooga Football Club and Dennis Crowley from Stockade.<br/><br/>In Part 5, I will disclose what I have discerned as one of the best answers to combating the stagnation of American soccer talent and improving the game as a whole. </p>

<p>  ""<strong>You had to be there</strong>"" may be an overused phrase, but those who witnessed the court proceedings for the Oregon Standoff trials have just cause to use it. One of the strangest trials in federal court history. 26 defendants, many who choose to represent themselves inside of a courtroom that they do not believe is legitimate. All the while battling a  judicial system not allowed to judge them on their beliefs. All documented by a guy with no law or artistic experience. </p>
<p>So take what you know about law, patriotism, art, and most importantly common sense, and toss it out the window. Bundy Court is now in session. </p>

<h3>Today and the future ...</h3>
<p>As of writing this, the book is about 3/4 done. However, as many of the trial followers know there is still a lot going on that I will no doubt try to cram in the book at the last minute. Still, I expect the roll out on this one to go much smoother than the first book <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-migration-comics/x/14537221#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""The Migration</a>.""</p>
<p>The first book was meant in part to be a fundraiser to cover some expenses to cover some of the Nevada trials that was supposed to start early 2017. Those trials were broken up into three, with the biggest trial postponed until this Fall and Winter. The first book sales ended up helping a lot with coverage for both of the Oregon trials, as well as some pre-funding for the NV trials. In turn, the can will get kicked again, and part of the money from this book will help with Nevada coverage. The more made the more coverage I can do.... but hey no pressure.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div></div>","""You had to be there"" may be an overused phrase, but those who witnessed the court proceedings for the Oregon Standoff trials have just cause to use it. One of the strangest trials in federal court history. 26 defendants, many who choose to represent themselves inside of a courtroom that they do not believe is legitimate. All the while battling a  judicial system not allowed to judge them on their beliefs. All documented by a guy with no law or artistic experience. 
So take what you know about law, patriotism, art, and most importantly common sense, and toss it out the window. Bundy Court is now in session.

<p><span>I am Clarence Mason “Weaver” minister, author and motivational speaker.

<p><span>My first book </span><span><em>“It’s ok to Leave the Plantation”</em></span><span> was more of a history book with my life story. It discussed the historical record of success and failures. But “</span><span><em>Tribalism</em></span><span>” is a story, discovering why we, the descendants of slaves, are still acting like slaves decades after the practiced ended.</span></p>
<p><span>This is a story of a tough drug dealing 14-year-old child discovering who he really is when he finds himself 150 years back into slavery. It forces him to recognize the true freedoms he had and understands the struggles which were paid by others. </span></p>
<p><span>This book will start the conversation, truth will bring the conversion. However, because of it's forbidden topic and anti-tribal chiefs views, we cannot publish it through normal means. This effort has to be guided by principles and protected with independence. This is why we need your help to publish and distribute it. </span></p>
<p><span>Can you imagine what will happen in America if the black community gave something back to their spouses and family instead of the “community?” What would happen instead of not forgetting where we “came from”, we did not forget where we were “going?”</span></p>
<p><span>The truth will set you free, believing a lie will enslave you. Help us spread the truth. </span></p>
<p><span>A Black Gang member robs a store and is shot in this mysterious field call The Pass. He wakes up to find himself 150 years back in history during slavery. He has been shot by slave hunters escaping the plantation. He remembers the future and realized how much he has lost. He is now a slave and helpless. He has no control and no hope. The lessons Jordan learns could lead him back to freedom. </span><span>  </span></p>
<p><span><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Have you ever known an abused woman? She will support the abuser, not the rescuer. She thinks supporting him will stop the beating and gain his love. The more he beats her the more support she has for him. If you call the police SHE will fight the police. If he leaves her she will find another just like him. The black community has suffered like an abused person. From slavery, Jim Crow, to the welfare system, we have been abused. But when any abused person gets enough, then watch out. We have had enough! The only way the abused person can really finally escape is to have a safe environment to rest and gather. </span><span><em>“Tribalism” </em></span><span>gives that abuse some light.

<p><span>However, like that abused woman, we will only seek help after we gets enough. This book is not for everyone, only those seeking help. Most will not buy the book, we have to give it to them. Help us provide a copy to the abused people.</span></p>
<p><span>I have self published 6 books and have sold thousands of copies. But this book cannot be sold through my normal marketing. It is marketed to a different client. I need to raise $10,000 to publish the first edition. I will donate hundreds of copies to key segments of the black community and follow up with a serious discussion of the issues. I offer no hope in changing the hearts and minds of every tribal member, but unless you send me, those looking to be free may never get the information.</span></p>
<p><span>We can change America, not black America, white America, poor or rich, but AMERICA. A place of no hyphenations, just Americans. But ONLY if you send a message.</span></p>

Probablemente el éxito dependería de tener otro golpe de suerte, porque no parecía que la explicación de todo fuera a ser algo evidente, lógico y cotidiano.<br/>     La opción extraterrestre era la que más me fascinaba, por ser, sin duda, la más increíble de todas las que imaginaba. Aunque, también me producía cierto temor, por el hecho de que pudiera terminar siendo abducida, ser sometida a terribles experimentos por todo el cuerpo o, peor aún, en la cabeza.<br/>     Y al final, ser devuelta al mundo, con la memoria alterada y no poder recordar nada de lo ocurrido.<br/>     Mi imaginación también proponía otras respuestas, tal vez, no tan increíbles, pero últimamente, tenía la impresión de que fantasía y realidad no se distanciaban tanto como siempre había pensado.<br/>     Sin ir más lejos, tenía a escasos centímetros un gato que hablaba y que era capaz de cambiar de tamaño a voluntad. Si eso podía pasar, por qué no pensar que cualquier cosa podía ocurrir, sin límites ni estereotipos. Quién le iba a decir a alguien hace cien años que íbamos a poner el pie en la luna. O, hace veinte, que podías mandar una foto a cientos de personas con un teléfono móvil.<br/>     También, me resultaba curioso el creciente interés de Pedro por recordar su primer viaje a la isla y que, de alguna manera, le había marcado tanto. Porque de no ser por ello, sería incomprensible que en el estado en el que se encontraba, fuese capaz de hacer el sobreesfuerzo que estaba realizando durante tanto tiempo. Tal vez, eso le pasase factura más adelante, pero habría que confiar en que todo saliera bien y, al final, regresásemos todos al puerto sanos y salvos»</p><h3>¿Cómo?</h3><p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 840€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p><ul>

Probablemente el éxito dependería de tener otro golpe de suerte, porque no parecía que la explicación de todo fuera a ser algo evidente, lógico y cotidiano.     La opción extraterrestre era la que más me fascinaba, por ser, sin duda, la más increíble de todas las que imaginaba. Aunque, también me producía cierto temor, por el hecho de que pudiera terminar siendo abducida, ser sometida a terribles experimentos por todo el cuerpo o, peor aún, en la cabeza.     Y al final, ser devuelta al mundo, con la memoria alterada y no poder recordar nada de lo ocurrido.     Mi imaginación también proponía otras respuestas, tal vez, no tan increíbles, pero últimamente, tenía la impresión de que fantasía y realidad no se distanciaban tanto como siempre había pensado.     Sin ir más lejos, tenía a escasos centímetros un gato que hablaba y que era capaz de cambiar de tamaño a voluntad. Si eso podía pasar, por qué no pensar que cualquier cosa podía ocurrir, sin límites ni estereotipos. Quién le iba a decir a alguien hace cien años que íbamos a poner el pie en la luna. O, hace veinte, que podías mandar una foto a cientos de personas con un teléfono móvil.     También, me resultaba curioso el creciente interés de Pedro por recordar su primer viaje a la isla y que, de alguna manera, le había marcado tanto. Porque de no ser por ello, sería incomprensible que en el estado en el que se encontraba, fuese capaz de hacer el sobreesfuerzo que estaba realizando durante tanto tiempo. Tal vez, eso le pasase factura más adelante, pero habría que confiar en que todo saliera bien y, al final, regresásemos todos al puerto sanos y salvos»¿Cómo?Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 840€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.
Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.
Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de Las increíbles aventuras de la Capitana Morgan que saldría después a la venta.Además...Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Daniel Vargas vea publicada su obra.Gracias por vuestro tiempo.",0.0,0,"228 Campaigns

Sabemos y creemos que es importante poder disponer del libro en diferentes lenguas, porque a todos nos cuesta menos cuando leemos en nuestra propia lengua.

Nuestro objetivo con esta guía es ayudar a las personas que van a lanzar o están poniendo en marcha un coworking para que tengan más éxito, tanto en el plano económico y de viabilidad de su iniciativa, como de activación de las comunidades de profesionales que albergan y en las que están incrustados. Los temas que tratamos van del marketing a la parte económica, pasando por la activación y gestión de comunidades de autónomos y emprendedores (los principales clientes). La base del contenido es nuestra propia experiencia en la creación de espacios de coworking. Ramón abrió el Betacowork Coworking de Bruselas en 2009 y ya tiene casi 200 miembros. Jaime es uno de los fundadores de workINcompany en Sevilla, que este año se ha ampliado a una nueva planta. Ramón ayuda a otros emprendedores con sus talleres en las conferencias Americana, Europea y Española de coworking.

Nos gustaría que aquellos que no tienen la oportunidad de asistir a las conferencias- o para quienes les pilla demasiado lejos en el tiempo- puedan avanzar en su conocimiento y proyecto. Queremos hacerles más fácil el trabajo y que tengán más éxito.Cómo es el libroEl contenido del libro es de orientación práctica. No somos académicos ni nos interesa hacer trabajo teórico. Para eso ya hay un montón de gente preparada y con mayor interés que está trabajando en las universidades y de otras organizaciones.Además, no somos los únicos y verdaderos profetas del coworking, por lo que he querido sumar a otras personas al proyecto involucrando a la comunidad del coworking.

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of most ages, welcome to my
very first crowdfunding project. I am Sean Walter, a writer living in Portland,
 Oregon (yes, that one) and I have, in the
last several years, written a novel-length collection of short stories. </p>
<p>A little about myself: I've been writing of my own accord since I was 8
years old, and some of the ideas used in this book have been with me for that
long, growing and maturing as I have. I've worked a multitude of jobs meeting
many interesting people along the way, but none of these jobs have brought me
as much joy or simple contentment as writing has. I would like to make it my
full-time career, and this is the first step. </p>
<h3>What is this book?</h3>
<p>The book itself is full of what is considered by some to be ""dark
literature."" That is to say, it's not suitable for people who don't enjoy
or cannot handle dark or strange things – things such as demons, death,
brutal honesty, drinking, bureaucratic gods, disgruntled imaginations, and plots that make you ponder reality. </p>
<p>It will be printed in paperback on common paperback-quality paper, and is
roughly 200 pages in length. I will also be making an e-book for those of you
who prefer your reading in a digital format, and an audiobook for those who like to listen.  </p>
<h3>And what will I get out of all of this?</h3>
<p>That entirely depends on what you wish to contribute, however, everyone who contributes will receive thanks in the book itself. <br/></p>

 the short story collection this campaign is funding. <i>*These stories,

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>My name is Jessica McCarter and I am the author of <i>75 Days of Jo</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to tell a story like the ones I used to love reading as a teen (and if I’m being honest with myself, I STILL love these types of stories.)<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you’ll get to escape from the stresses of everyday life, which is something I’ve always loved about reading - getting lost in a story. I also hope that you’ll be able to relate to the characters of this book and what they go through, even if you aren’t currently a freshman in college (the time in Jo’s life in which this book takes place).<br/><br/><i>75 Days of Jo</i> is a fictional young adult novel that follows the life of Jo throughout her first semester of college. Jo, a kind yet insecure 18-year-old, is left feeling anxious and distraught when her parents wave their final goodbyes after moving her into college. The reality of being in a new place, knowing no one, without her family nearby, weighs heavily on Jo. Lucky for her, she meets Ginger, a quick-witted, fiercely loyal, and brutally honest girl that lives in the room next door. Jo and Ginger become fast friends and together they navigate the highs and lows of being new college students - dealing with crazy roommates, going to parties, and meeting boys. Emphasis on meeting boys.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you like to read light, yet entertaining, teen romance novels while:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sitting on the beach on a warm summer day</li>
<li>Cozying up in a nook at Starbucks on a rainy Tuesday</li>
<li>Laying in bed until noon on your day off from school/work</li>
</ul>
<i>75 Days of Jo</i> speaks to anyone who has gone through a time in their life feeling insecure and lonely but has come out on the other side stronger and more confident. This book also speaks to anyone who loves getting butterflies when they meet someone special.<br/><br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December, 2020</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this winter</li>
</ul>
<p> </p> When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish</li>
<li>A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</li>
<li>Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)</li>
<li>Early access to the Introduction of my Book and some additional sections of my manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback</li>
<li>The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover</li>
<li>I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my book</li>
<li>And more...</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Jessica, a Pennsylvania State University graduate with a degree in Supply Chain, has always loved reading, writing, and being creative. Outside of her career in e-commerce, she finds ways to express herself through blogging, podcasting, and most recently writing a book! One of Jessica’s biggest accomplishments was co-founding an organization that raised money in the fight against pediatric cancer. Through this experience, Jessica learned the importance of being part of a community that encourages everyone to be themselves and share their stories.<br/><br/><i>75 Days of Jo</i> pays homage to that exact sentiment - anything is possible if you surround yourself with the right people and the right community.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Jessica on the following social media platforms:<br/>Facebook: Jessica McCarter<br/>Instagram: jesslynnmcc<br/>Linkedin: Jessica McCarter</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #75daysofjo and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so we can help amplify your efforts.</li>
<li>You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page</li>
<li>Please share my book to 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it. Please do this as a text message or Direct Message on social media.</li>

Sitting on the beach on a warm summer day
Cozying up in a nook at Starbucks on a rainy Tuesday
Laying in bed until noon on your day off from school/work

75 Days of Jo speaks to anyone who has gone through a time in their life feeling insecure and lonely but has come out on the other side stronger and more confident. This book also speaks to anyone who loves getting butterflies when they meet someone special. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

About the Author
Jessica, a Pennsylvania State University graduate with a degree in Supply Chain, has always loved reading, writing, and being creative. Outside of her career in e-commerce, she finds ways to express herself through blogging, podcasting, and most recently writing a book! One of Jessica’s biggest accomplishments was co-founding an organization that raised money in the fight against pediatric cancer. Through this experience, Jessica learned the importance of being part of a community that encourages everyone to be themselves and share their stories.75 Days of Jo pays homage to that exact sentiment - anything is possible if you surround yourself with the right people and the right community.For more information you can connect with Jessica on the following social media platforms:Facebook: Jessica McCarterInstagram: jesslynnmccLinkedin: Jessica McCarter
 
Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<p>I've been accepted to attend <a href=""http://www.lasdosbrujas.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Las Dos Brujas Writer's Workshop</strong></a> in San Francisco this summer and I'm thrilled to participate in my first conference. Over the five-day conference I'll spend mornings in a <strong>memoir workshop</strong> led by author Denise Chávez and participate in <strong>mini workshops</strong> during my afternoons covering topics like resistance through prose and poetry, publishing 101, and strengthening my voice.</p>
<p>This will be my first formal writing coursework since high school almost a decade ago and I'm excited to continue my growth as I work towards writing a book. I am so thankful that you're reading this now to learn about this opportunity, the importance of it in my life, as a person and a writer, and the gifts I'm offering in exchange for your financial support in making it possible.</p>

<p>I’m asking for a total of <strong>$675 </strong>and am excited to make and gift a few perks for every donor.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of this campaign goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuition (Discounted Student Rate), $575</li>
<li>Application fee, $35</li>
<li>Estimated Indiegogo fees (8% overall [5% platform plus 3% + $0.30 per transaction]), $65</li>

<p><b>Hand-written Post Cards </b>are basically an excuse to send you something via my favorite form of communication (ahem, snail mail!) and tell you why I appreciate you. My hand will definitely get a work out, but it's an honor to get the chance to tell you why you're great and thank you individually for showing support.</p>

<h3>Gracias / Thank You</h3>
<p>Your contributions are funding my professional development as writer and will allow me to refine my work so that I can publish a book in the future. In my work as a freelancer, I focus on amplifying the voices of folks from marginalized communities because I recognize the hurdles people of color, LGBTQ, and others face. Authors of color are <strong>critically needed</strong> because our words are not published as often as our white counterparts and neither are our experiences (you can read more on this <a href=""http://msmagazine.com/blog/2016/02/10/the-overwhelming-whiteness-of-the-publishing-industry/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""http://blog.leeandlow.com/2017/03/30/the-diversity-gap-in-childrens-book-publishing-2017/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>). Equal representation in media creates a sense of belonging, especially for folks who are othered, and helps eradicate the stereotyping that is perpetuated through one-dimensional depictions.</p>
<p>While we have a long way to go before writers of color are represented equally in publishing, supporting my writing and journey into publishing is one small step you can take alongside me in helping to close that gap.</p>

with children and the people who take care of them. My vision is to have
Enlightened Moms and Dads, Evolved Kids (c), every child consciously conceived,
born and raised with love and wisdom. I see peaceful, alive, vital people and
families.  I see respect and honor for
each child. Yes, I know what a tall order this may seem . That’s one of the
reasons I wrote <b><i>WHAT IF</i></b>? </p><p></p><p><b>Take a <a href=""http://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/12/12/what-if-book-sample-update-1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FREE peek at WHAT IF?</a> here!  </b>Download now! Print it out!  Color!  Enjoy!</p>

understand themselves and one another. Imagine you are at peace with yourself,
either free of or wisely transforming insecurities and fears.  What if everyone was like this?  Wow! 
Imagine you live with clean air, water, earth, amidst trees and plants,
whether you live in the city, suburbs, country or elsewhere. Image great
relationships.  How do we create this?
Where do we begin? 
To me, everything starts at home,
with children and the people who take care of them. My vision is to have
Enlightened Moms and Dads, Evolved Kids (c), every child consciously conceived,
born and raised with love and wisdom. I see peaceful, alive, vital people and

reasons I wrote WHAT IF? Take a FREE peek at WHAT IF? here!  Download now! Print it out!  Color!  Enjoy!
                                                                              
Why is this book important to YOU?

WHAT IF? is
designed to spark children’s learning, imaginations, creativity, self-esteem,
communication skills, reading ability, vocabulary and ingenuity. Kids need an adult
to read through the amusing, deep, fun words.


WHAT IF? entertains
and enhances the intelligence and wisdom in both child and adult.


WHAT IF? inspires stream-of-consciousness
thinking. The kids and adults love inventing stories about all the words. This
builds children’s self-confidence, communication ability, and love of learning.


WHAT IF?
will be a printed book, beautiful, brilliant and beneficial to kids, adults, and
planet because this book will be printed on 100 percent post-consumer recycled paper that actually helps save the earth. This
will be my first printed book.


WHAT IF? engages the mind, heart, body and
essence of both child and adult, a superb way to integrate learning. Playing
around with the book’s art literally shifts the reader’s brain patterns,
causing more creativity, ingenuity and intelligence, opening the way to new
family dynamics.  Each letter of the
alphabet has both its own picture as well as its own stunning design and
vocabulary, adding up to 52 pages available for coloring.








Why
does 100 percent post-consumer recycled paper benefit you and your family?

Because our beautiful planet is
undergoing ecological challenge and I am absolutely committed to having a
sustainable present and future for our children, all my books will be printed
on 100 percent post-consumer recycled paper. 
According to GreenPressInitiative.org, approximately 30
million trees are used to make books sold in the U.S. – 1,153 times the number
of trees in NYC’s Central Park. Many of these trees are sourced from endangered
forests with devastating impacts on the people and wildlife that rely on them.
This is unacceptable to me!
 If we continue to refuse to use 100 percent post-consumer recycled paper we get:
Deforestation, which accounts for 25 percent of human-caused CO2 emissions, a direct cause of global warming that can be stopped.
Virgin paper usage, which makes up 40 percent of the waste stream, inundating us in garbage, leading to the production of methane, even worse that CO2.
A huge escalation locally and globally in lung dis-eases such as emphysema and cancers, as our oxygen, boosted by trees, the lungs of the planet, decreases tremendously.
A large uprooting and destruction of native peoples everywhere, making all of us poorer.
Skyrocketing cost of energy to manufacture books, newspapers and other paper products.
Studies have shown that 80 percent of readers are willing to spend more money for books made with recycled paper and environmentally responsible paper. This gives WHAT IF? a great chance to be a best-seller, helping kids and families everywhere. This helps YOU and YOUR FAMILY directly.
                                                                    
What new possibilities exist for you, your children, grandchildren and the planet?
To print the endearing and delightful WHAT IF? on 100 percent post-consumer recycled paper, finances are required. The norm in the publishing and printing industries is either virgin paper or paper with a bit of recycled paper, usually pre-consumer recycled, which means trees are still being destroyed.



YOU GET:  Healthy, happy children, who can breathe and play among the trees and plants.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p><i>Long Story, Short Journal</i> was established in 2012 as a labour of love. Founding Editor Jennifer Matthews wanted to create a home for longer short stories, 4000 words or more, which often had difficulty being placed in traditional journals in Ireland fiction submissions are often limited to 2000 or 3000 words. Why is size so important? While smaller short stories can be satisfying reads, they're also limited in the scope of what they can accomplish. Rarely do you see a professionally published collection of short stories where every piece is so diminutive--so where is a budding writer to hone her skills if professional literary journals won't accept longer work?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The current funding situation</h3>
<p>From the beginning the Founding Editor has been happy to fund the webhosting and templates from her own pocket, in the hopes that funding applications might help out eventually with author payments, etc. A modest 'tip jar' was added to the site, but donations are rare. Funding applications with government arts agencies have also similarly been unsuccessful, despite the unique resource this journal provides. And so, writers and artists continue to generously contribute their work despite lack of funding for payment.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How will the money raised be used?</h3>
<p>Here's the plan: this funding drive hopes to raise enough to pay each writer from 2012 through 2017 a modest sum. After that, funds raised will supply a modest gift to our tireless volunteers who have kept this journal afloat over the years--including our proofreader and our two guest editors for 2017. They have generously donated huge amounts of their own time to others, with no expectation of recompense (and at the expense of their own time to write).<br/><br/>(Founding Editor/ Editor-in-Chief, Jennifer Matthews, will  NOT be on the receiving end of any payment--this remains her labour of love; and this journal remains a not-for-profit enterprise.) <br/>The remainder of the money raised will go towards paying the crowdfunding fees.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How you can help</h3>

The anthology is 100+ pages of very short forms including flash fiction, portraits, short shorts and prose poems--from start to finish a quirky and addictive read!</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>
When teens at Girls for Gender Equity conducted participatory action research on the state of sexual harassment in NYC public schools, they found that <i><b>1 in 4 students is sexually harassed daily</b></i>. The acts of violence range from verbal (71%) to physical (63%) to sexual assault (10%). Forty years after the U.S. federal government passed Title IX to end to sex discrimination in schools, sexual harassment continues to plague the lives of young women and LGBTQ youth.
<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
Research shows the effects daily harassment has on youth can range from social alienation to poor grades to destructive behaviors, like dropping out of school and suicide. Still, many dismiss this form of gender-based violence as a rite of passage for adolescents, as a ""normal"" part of school. However, this doesn't have to be the case and teen girls in NYC prove just how powerful their voices can be as a force for change in <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558616691?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=feminrevie-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1558616691"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Hey, Shorty!: A Guide to Combating Sexual Harassment and Violence in Schools and on the Streets</a><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: normal;""></span></i>. The book is a new resource for young people and adults to use to spark conversations in in their communities about how to cope with sexual harassment while working to increase safety in schools.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>
Girls for Gender Equity is taking <i>Hey, Shorty!</i> on the road -- making stops at bookstores, schools, and community centers to lead conversations with youth and adults that will build connections among organizations and individuals doing anti-violence work nationwide and encourage young people to become agents of social change. Our goal is to provide them with the model that is working in New York City so that they may learn from our successes and setbacks in order to replicate this work in their community. We want to facilitate 25 events between May and December, and this is why we need your help!

</p>
<p>
“<i>Hey, Shorty!</i> is an invaluable piece of work. Within each short story lies a lesson or a reminder of how valuable it is to listen to members of your community when you’re organizing, and give a voice to the underrepresented, the silenced, and the quiet members, too. <i>Hey, Shorty!</i> will lift you up when you hit obstacles and show you that there really is always a will and a way. It will lend insight into how to circumnavigate your campus and how to rally your troops.” - Carmen Rios, teen organizer from SPARK Summit</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>“<i>Hey, Shorty!</i> offers a detailed blueprint for how to make the streets and schools safer for our girls (and everyone else) – by empowering young people to take leadership on this issue and supporting them to develop effective strategies. These girls’ work is a potent example of youth activism: they successfully raised awareness about an issue that has too often gone ignored.” – Elizabeth Mendez Berry, journalist</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>“This book is full of great ideas for youth organizing and coalition work. What’s most impressive is how GGE encouraged girls to articulate their issues and goals, and then worked with them to learn the skills they needed to achieve their goals. The result? A whole new generation of smart, knowledgeable, articulate and empowered young women. Women who will change the world.” – Ms. Magazine<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>“The book provides a model for action through the example of Girls for Gender Equity’s work, in particular the model of prioritizing youth leadership on issues that relate to youth because, as Joanne N. Smith notes, they are the experts on these issues and they are the main stakeholders.” – Holly Kearl, author of <i>Stop Street Harassment</i>

What People Are Saying About Hey, Shorty!
A full list of our press coverage can be found here. But here is a sampling:


“Hey, Shorty! is an invaluable piece of work. Within each short story lies a lesson or a reminder of how valuable it is to listen to members of your community when you’re organizing, and give a voice to the underrepresented, the silenced, and the quiet members, too. Hey, Shorty! will lift you up when you hit obstacles and show you that there really is always a will and a way. It will lend insight into how to circumnavigate your campus and how to rally your troops.” - Carmen Rios, teen organizer from SPARK Summit

“Hey, Shorty! offers a detailed blueprint for how to make the streets and schools safer for our girls (and everyone else) – by empowering young people to take leadership on this issue and supporting them to develop effective strategies. These girls’ work is a potent example of youth activism: they successfully raised awareness about an issue that has too often gone ignored.” – Elizabeth Mendez Berry, journalist

“This book is full of great ideas for youth organizing and coalition work. What’s most impressive is how GGE encouraged girls to articulate their issues and goals, and then worked with them to learn the skills they needed to achieve their goals. The result? A whole new generation of smart, knowledgeable, articulate and empowered young women. Women who will change the world.” – Ms. Magazine

“The book provides a model for action through the example of Girls for Gender Equity’s work, in particular the model of prioritizing youth leadership on issues that relate to youth because, as Joanne N. Smith notes, they are the experts on these issues and they are the main stakeholders.” – Holly Kearl, author of Stop Street Harassment




Special thanks to the teen women of Sisters in Strength for demonstrating a fierce determination to make sure concerns for one's safety don't impede a good education. And much love to Feminist Press for seeing our potential and helping us to bring it forth!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns
