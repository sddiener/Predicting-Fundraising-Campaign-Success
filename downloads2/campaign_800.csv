<h3>YEMADA Farm</h3>
<ul>
<li>YEMADA Farm it s a community for people to live together and grow in harmony with the Nature. We are a group of friends with a similar vision of being set sufficient, having natural houses made out of clay, Integral education for ourselves and the children. Once, we believe in human evolution we need spaces for exploring our passions, music, dance , circus, so we decide to build a Dome where we can explore what we Love and share with others.</li>
<li>This campaign is a way to open the door to people to come and be part of the realisation of this dream and at the same time help us to pay the Dome. We are people that live in a simple way and without fix jobs, investing our time in building a community that can be an example for people to get inspired. So, the Dome it s a great step forward, so we can start to open the doors and do more courses at our farm!</li>
<li>This Dome it s dream that we have since long time! Now it s true, it already exist. We just need to pay 5000 euros, and you are part of this reality, once you will come to enjoy this Dome and also the full Yemada Farm experience!!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We already paid 5000 Euros and now we need to pay the other 5000 euros to Iris, a friend that sold us the Dome and gave us the chance to have enough time to raise funds for paying the rest.</li>
<li> We offer you amazing perks that will give you the chance to come to our farm, to visit, to relax,to learn, to get inspired, to spend some time with us or even to participate in the diferent  Workshops that we propose for you: Music, Dance and Circus!!!!</li>
<li>All the funds will go to pay the Dome and for getting the infrastructures that we need to make it more comfortable(solar panels, eco-toilet).</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> This Dome is one Place dedicated to Human Evolution, for Integral Education, for adults and Kids explore their authenticity!</p>
<p>  Some of us had the chance to live in Auroville,India for several years and we had the experience of building amazing infrastructures where we could really enjoy all the activities that we Love to do! Now we want to create a place similar to Auroville where people from all over the world can come and change their lives!</p>
<p>The good news is that the Dome already exist!!So, we just need the support of each one of you! If everybody can give some money according to their possibilities and to which perk they want, we ll make it together!!!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>We took 2 months to build it up, specially because we had to open the place by hand , without using any machine and its a 10 square meter dome, what means was a lot of digging all by hand. Than it was a challenge to build the structure, because we are not dome experts, but we had enough power to do it and the support of Pedro Barros, the Dome creator, that answer all the phone calls with all the doubts that we had!Thank you all that already helped!</li>
<li>Now the great challenge is just to pay it, because we don't want to abandon the farm and go work faraway and leave the fruit trees, the garden, all the Social Projects that we part of. So, we prefer to trust that everything will flow and with all the support of family, friends and people that believe in this Project we ll make it!</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Over the past 6 years Black Cat Artspace has hosted over 180 exhibitions and events in a wide variety of mediums, by local emerging and established artists, collectives, and curators. Filling a much needed niche in Toronto of both a place to get started as an exhibiting artist, from students to established artists and the go to venue for featured exhibitions as part of Toronto's cultural festivals, our space has proven to be available to all, inclusive, and much needed!</p>
<p>But it’s more than just a venue. As an alternative space, Black Cat doesn’t have to follow any particular discourse, aesthetic, or rules. It’s fluid, and what you make of it. Spaces like Black Cat play an important role in the Toronto arts scene as a meeting place, a venue for free expression and a zone for experimentation.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is with great excitement that we are announcing the launch of a new Gallery and Studio space at 1785 St. Clair West that will be run with the same ethos. We’ll be opening this December with the 5th annual Salon of Inclusiveness group show. It’s going to take a bit of work to transform it from its current state into a gallery, but with the help of our community and long hours we are confident to complete it all. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Apapachoa. The ""Eco-Cultural center Apapachoa”, just opened its doors in the middle of the natural reserve “El Bajo”, below the dramatic hills of El Crucero a unique landscape in Nicaragua. It is located just about 30 minutes from busy Managua in the rural community of Santa Julia. Apapachoa in Nahuatl, one of the original indigenous language of Nicaragua means “to hug with your soul”.</p>
<p>We promote arts, music, sports as well as organic, bio-intensive agriculture and permaculture. In brief we are cultural center in the middle of a 2300 acres jungle trying to reach sustainability based around 3 axes: the agriculture, the cultural center and the eco-tourism. </p>
<p>We believe that through ART, music and culture we can create social impact. </p>
<p>That is why we decided to bring the Fabulous Artist Jelili Atiku to come and work with us. Jelili is a renown Nigerian artist that has been working all around the globe for the rights of the people. He has a deep human knowledge and that is why we need him to be our first resident Artist! </p>
<p>You can learn more about him here: <a href=""http://www.jeliliatiku.webs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.jeliliatiku.webs.com</a></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In brief we need $4000 to get him here from Lagos. We divide it that way: $2200 for his flight, $100 for his Visa, $1700 for his stay here and materials to work with.If you help us you can get a range of things from Apapachoa.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe that Art can heal many wounds and help create new realities.</p>
<p>Jelili defines his work this way: ""I have put my art at service of the prevailing concerns of our times; especially those issues that threatening our collective existence and the sustenance of our universe. Therefore, the contents of these concerns ranging from psychosocial and emotional effects of the traumatic events: violence, war, poverty, corruption, climate change, etc.,that associated with our warring world dominate my artistic forms. Doing drawing, installation sculpture, video and performance art; I strive to help viewers understand the world and expand their understanding and experiences, so that they can activate and renew their lives and environments.</p>

I am John Kennedy – real name. I’m producing a documentary about people leaving prison for PBS Frontline and the New York Times, I play in a punk band, and I also do some street art. I'm working with Manoj Kesavan of the Boom Festival in Charlotte, the painter Nick Napoletano, and Buff Faye, the current reigning Miss Charlotte Pride. Nick is an incredible painter – his paintings look like the Sistine Chapel. We are creating a large wall mural during the Boom Festival - starting in <span>April 7-10</span> at the Plaza Midwood Neighborhood. The image will be based on a play-on-words, that Charlotte is called the Queen City – “The Drag Queens of Queen City.”  This mural will hopefully be the first of a series. It will be playful, cool, visually fantastic and a celebration of underground culture, local drag history/legends and Charlotte being an inclusive and progressive city. The Drag Queens we will showcase are: Boom Boom LaTour, Toni Lenoir, Kasey King, and Brandy Alexander, who recently passed away.  </div><div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>We are raising $7500 to pay for the artist, paint, equipment, and to create 5000 postcards.</li> <li>At the $500 level of support you will get your name or the name of your company on the back of the postcard. The postcard will be made of the mural and distributed to stores, restaurants, and music venues in Charlotte. </li>
<li>For donation less than $500 - please come down to the Boom Festival and meet John, Nick, and Buff Faye.</li> <li>We will continue to fundraise until we cover these costs.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>We support LGBT rights and alternative communities, like the drag queen community in Charlotte. We are hoping that this mural honors our local drag history and helps Charlotte to define itself an an inclusive city. </li>
<li>Buff Faye is the reigning Miss Charlotte Pride, and she works toward creating an open, accepting, and fun community. Nick Napoletano's painting can be seen on billboards in Charlotte, supported by the Arts and Science Council. John Kennedy is an art activist and project manager who had managed productions and campaigns for the Gates Foundation, UN Millennium Campaign, Open Society Foundations, New York Times, as well as others. </li>
<li>Murals are unique in art, that as public works depicting individuals from a community they help a neighborhood define itself. </li>
</ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> We have three weeks to raise $7500. The Boom Festival is committed to finding us a wall in the Plaza Midwood Neighborhood in Charlotte, NC. We are committed to using our personal networks or friends and activists to fund this mural. We feel it is an important and timely statement for Charlotte to make, to show support of its alternative communities. John Kennedy will sit down with anyone who is interested in this project. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <ul> <li>Ok - I need your help. Basically we are making a large public mural in Charlotte that will coincide with their BOOM Festival on April 7-10. Charlotte is the ""Queen City"" and the mural will be ""The Drag Queens of Queen City."" We need this to be real for this community. We need people to not only share, but to back this and ask their friends to share. If you know people who are very passionate about the drag community, about gay/lesbian/bi/transgender rights please talk with them. We need to build up a huge network within three weeks and talk to as many people who could be significant funders as soon as possible. So - please don't just nod your head - get behind this as a group of friends. We want Charlotte to really own this mural.</li> <li>You can always use Indiegogo share tools!</li> </ul> </div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Short Summary

Nick is an incredible painter – his paintings look like the Sistine Chapel. We are creating a large wall mural during the Boom Festival - starting in April 7-10 at the Plaza Midwood Neighborhood. The image will be based on a play-on-words, that Charlotte is called the Queen City – “The Drag Queens of Queen City.”  This mural will hopefully be the first of a series. It will be playful, cool, visually fantastic and a celebration of underground culture, local drag history/legends and Charlotte being an inclusive and progressive city. The Drag Queens we will showcase are: Boom Boom LaTour, Toni Lenoir, Kasey King, and Brandy Alexander, who recently passed away.  
   What We Need & What You Get  We are raising $7500 to pay for the artist, paint, equipment, and to create 5000 postcards. At the $500 level of support you will get your name or the name of your company on the back of the postcard. The postcard will be made of the mural and distributed to stores, restaurants, and music venues in Charlotte. 
For donation less than $500 - please come down to the Boom Festival and meet John, Nick, and Buff Faye. We will continue to fundraise until we cover these costs.    The Impact


We support LGBT rights and alternative communities, like the drag queen community in Charlotte. We are hoping that this mural honors our local drag history and helps Charlotte to define itself an an inclusive city. 
Buff Faye is the reigning Miss Charlotte Pride, and she works toward creating an open, accepting, and fun community. Nick Napoletano's painting can be seen on billboards in Charlotte, supported by the Arts and Science Council. John Kennedy is an art activist and project manager who had managed productions and campaigns for the Gates Foundation, UN Millennium Campaign, Open Society Foundations, New York Times, as well as others. 
Murals are unique in art, that as public works depicting individuals from a community they help a neighborhood define itself. 
    Risks & Challenges  We have three weeks to raise $7500. The Boom Festival is committed to finding us a wall in the Plaza Midwood Neighborhood in Charlotte, NC. We are committed to using our personal networks or friends and activists to fund this mural. We feel it is an important and timely statement for Charlotte to make, to show support of its alternative communities. John Kennedy will sit down with anyone who is interested in this project.    Other Ways You Can Help  Ok - I need your help. Basically we are making a large public mural in Charlotte that will coincide with their BOOM Festival on April 7-10. Charlotte is the ""Queen City"" and the mural will be ""The Drag Queens of Queen City."" We need this to be real for this community. We need people to not only share, but to back this and ask their friends to share. If you know people who are very passionate about the drag community, about gay/lesbian/bi/transgender rights please talk with them. We need to build up a huge network within three weeks and talk to as many people who could be significant funders as soon as possible. So - please don't just nod your head - get behind this as a group of friends. We want Charlotte to really own this mural. You can always use Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>What's is Savannah?</strong><br/><br/>Savannah is a space in which we both play. Savannah is an exotic landscape that is seemingly monotonous, while it actually holds the potential for sudden abrupt change. We generate the exotic based on our own personal histories and we let this clash on stage. By doing so, we construct a new idea of exoticism.<br/><br/><br/>Our process has had two phases so far. The first took place in Zurich, in September 2015, where we had our first residency in Tanzhaus Zurich. Marc Walter Streit and Catja Loepfe, artistic directors of Tanzhaus Zurich, believed in us enough to give us a space to test out our ideas. As we planted the first layers of Savannah, the result started looking promising, and we got invited to show the work in Tanztage in Berlin, a festival curated by Anna Muelter.<br/><br/>As we continued to work on Savannah, the need emerged for having a third person that could manipulate the space while we played and that could observe us. A person who could establish a bridge between us and the fantasy world. That was when we invited Yorgos Sapountzis to join us, and the piece became a trio.<br/><br/>We asked Marcelo Alcaide to style our costumes, and we added a layer of branding by wearing only adidas sportswear. Like this we shamelessly refer to the fetishization of brands in this world.</p>
<p><br/>Savannah was very well received by the audience. We managed to bring together audience from the dance scene with people form other sectors that normally don’t go to the theater so much, like people in fashion, branding.... It is our belief that performance art nowadays can establish bridges between different areas of life and we feel that we Savannah we achieved this goal.<br/><br/>So now what?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because of this inittial succes of Savannah, Tanzhaus Zurich, in collaboration with SudPol Lucerne, decided to offer us two more weeks of residency, during which we will work in a dance studio, have a place to live in Luzerne, and a presentation of the work, on the 15th of October. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What do we want to do?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>During these two weeks we want to shorten the piece, complexify the choreographic language that we started, and reflect on the specific direction this journey is taking. </p>
<p><br/><strong>And that's why we're here.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We want to gather 2500 euros and this money would go to traveling costs from Berlin to Switzerland, production money for the piece, living expenses in Switzerland, and a chance to be able to give a fair remuneration to everyone involved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will have the campaign running while the residency is happening so make sure to stay updated about the progress of Savannah! If you have any questions during this time and want to know more about the work, we will be more than happy to get back to you and we are happy to share the process with anyone who wants to know more about it.<br/><br/>Any little donation counts for us and we hope we can count on you. We want to bring everyone closer to our project and build bridges once again. If you want to be a part of the Savannah landscape, feel free to give what you can.</p>

In 1990 Mona and her husband, Renaissance man <strong>Peter Haase</strong>, moved from Vancouver to Salt Spring Island with their children and established (m)Other Tongue Press in their basement studio–first as a vibrant private press publishing gorgeous limited editions of Canadian poetry and book art, with letterpress and artwork by Peter–then evolving into a literary &amp; art trade publisher when Mona decided it was time to bring her history and literary skills to the fore (her father was a brilliant but forgotten Vancouver artist) and shine a spotlight on the <strong>Unheralded Artists of British Columbia</strong>.</p><p><strong>The Unheralded Artists of B.C. (UABC) </strong>is an unprecedented series of beautifully designed and well-researched books, illustrating and illuminating the lives and art of previously undocumented important artists of the 1900s-1960s, (there were over 17,000 artists working in B.C. during that time). Each book is printed in full colour and contains– months of research, over 100 images, an introduction, exhibition list, endnotes and index. The books are well-written by deeply committed B.C. writers and the stories are engaging and important.</p><p>Now, after nine years of hard work, amazing art sleuthing adventures; working with wonderful writers and artist’s families, great book celebrations and exhibitions, all while walking a financial tightrope, we are now reaching out for support for the publication of the <strong>next two titles</strong>, #9 and #10, in this unprecedented series</p><p>It is a big undertaking for a small publisher (one-woman office) to continue with such a visionary and labour intensive project without greater support. The artists featured are not famous or well-known, so it has been hard to match expenses with book sales, but that is exactly why these books are important; these artists inform the deeper narrative of our cultural history. This series is presently sustained by the passionate dedication of writers and freelance workers and self-sacrifice (Mona is the unpaid publisher) plus small grants and book sales. At <a href=""http://www.mothertonguepublishing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Mother Tongue</strong></a>, quality is key, good writing and research is important and the books must be beautiful. Two titles have been finalists for the Roderick Haig-Brown Regional Prize and the Victoria Butler Book Prize, and the series can be found in better bookstores, libraries or ordered on-line from our website. Our sales are represented in North America by Heritage Group Distribution.</p><p>The donations received for this campaign will give us the funds to complete production and publication of the extraordinary <strong><i>Life and Art of Mary Filer-UABC </i>#9 by Christina Johnson-Dean, due out in October 2016</strong>, and help us move forward on the remarkable <strong><i>Life and Art of Arthur Pitts</i>-UABC #10 by Kerry Mason</strong>, due out in <strong>October 2017</strong>.</p><p>We hope you value the series and will support it and spread the word.

During the 1950s, Filer studied under Group of Seven artist Arthur Lismer and painter John Lyman and taught university art. Filer moved to Victoria and Vancouver in the 60s where she was on the forefront of the glass art movement. Her involvement with architects and her partnership with Harold Spence-Sales, who started the first School of Urban Planning in Canada at McGill University, led to an honourary doctorate from Simon Fraser University in 1991 and an Allied Arts Silver Medal from the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada in 1992. Major examples of her cold glass sculpture are at SFU Harbour Centre and the Vancouver General Hospital. Her work is in numerous collections, including the National Gallery of Canada, the Toronto Art Gallery, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria. This is an important story about an often neglected genre of Canadian art history.</p><p><strong>Christina Johnson-Dean </strong>graduated from the University of California (B.A. in History, Art) and trained as a teacher. After teaching and travelling around the world, she settled in Victoria, B.C. to be near family. At the University of Victoria, she completed an MA (History in Art), serving as a teaching assistant and creating courses in local art history for Continuing Studies. Her publications include The Crease Family: A Record of Settlement and Service in British Columbia (B.C. Archives, 1981), “B.C. Women Artists 1885-1920” in British Columbia Women Artists (Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, 1985), and The Life and Art of Ina D.D.

His early fascination with indigenous cultures led him on a lifelong quest to document in vibrant watercolours, sketches and photographs what Western society perceived to be “vanishing peoples,” just as George Catlin, Paul Kane, Edward Curtis and Emily Carr had also done. Pitts also created an entire series of landscapes, portraits and architectural subjects, commercial work and hundreds of cartoons for <i>Punch</i> magazine. Travelling more than 4,000 miles in British Columbia and Alaska, he produced a large body of work focusing on Coast Salish, Tlingit and Ktunaxa First Nations. Pitts’ fascinating story includes life as an artist in Vancouver in the 1920s and 1930s, where he attended the Vancouver School of Decorative and Applied Arts, studying under Fred Varley, Charles Scott and J.W.G. Macdonald; WWI trench warfare and a host of “struggle and prevail” adventures. His work is in the collections of the Royal BC Museum, the Glenbow Museum and several important private collections abroad.

He is one of a generation of late modernists who have just left us–one thinks of Chillida or Oteiza in Spain, for example–whose work will endure. His accomplishment deserves to be better known in Canada, and at its best merits recognition worldwide.”–<strong>Barry Lord</strong>, President of Lord Cultural Resources</p><p> </p><p>“Mother Tongue is to be congratulated for launching its timely Unheralded Artists of BC series.”-<strong>Maria Tippett</strong>, author</p><p> </p><p>“Mona Fertig and her series Unheralded Artists of British Columbia has made a wonderful start on filling the gaps in our art history. There are lots of the unheralded in B.C. art, and I’m hoping that this series will go on and on.” –<strong>Cheryl Siegel</strong>, former Librarian/Archivist, Vancouver Art Gallery</p><p> </p><p>“You are doing a great service for the cultural history of British Columbia by publishing these books, and I marvel that you can do it on such a modest budget.”–<strong>Michael J. Audain</strong>, The Audain Foundation </p><p> </p><p>“Mildred Valley Thonrton’s work is a documentation of an era…. I think she should have received the Order of Canada, but she didn’t live long enough.”—<strong>Christian Corbet</strong>, artist, historian and founder of the Canadian Portrait Academy</p><p> </p><p> “She (Mildred Valley Thornton) was gutsy. Her work reminds me a little of the freshness of Tom Thomson’s. She was really, really good. I hope she gets some recognition now.”—<strong>Gordon Smith</strong>, Canadian artist</p><p> </p><p>“In a province with thousands of wonderful unheralded artists, Mother Tongue Publishing’s project is an important beginning to what will no doubt become a really significant series of books.” –<strong>Bill Jeffries</strong>, former Director, SFU Gallery</p><p> </p><p>“Your father (George Fertig) was a mystic really. He had a clairvoyance of a very unusual and remarkable kind. He didn’t sell it. He didn’t advertise it. But he painted it.”—<strong>Leonard Woods</strong>, artist, teacher, writer</p><p> </p><p>“The Burnaby Art Gallery is delighted to be a contributing partner in the George Fertig project. As an art gallery dedicated to British Columbia’s emerging and established artists, it is with great pleasure that we are able to include one of Mother Tongue Publishing’s unheralded artists within our exhibition program. Spiritually inspired and meticulously crafted, Fertig’s paintings seek to challenge each viewer to contemplate the relationships that exist between time and space and the subjects he has chosen to represent.” —<strong>Darrin Martens</strong>; former Director/Curator Burnaby Art Gallery</p><p> </p><p>“Unfortunately, not all artists get recognition during their lifetime. George Fertig is a good example of a ﬁne painter whose sensible handling of both palette and perspective captured the BC landscape and who is only now being discovered. My painting of English Bay is a joy to live with and I observe the artist’s love of the subject every time I look at it.”—<strong>Uno Langmann</strong>; collector, art dealer</p><p> </p><p>“Artist Ina Uhthoff, like her friend Emily Carr, held a passionate desire to see a permanent gallery in Victoria where people could experience art that reflected the modern era. At mid-century when the capital city had very little art presence, she was a driving force in support of founding what would become the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria. Her role in establishing the Gallery’s permanent home and hiring its first curator/director, Colin Graham, cannot be underestimated.”—<strong>Mary Jo Hughes</strong>, former chief curator, Art Gallery of Greater Victoria</p><p> </p><p>“I was captured by the opening line and held fast til the last word. Christina Johnson-Dean has created a wonderfully lively, fast-moving, detailed life story of the remarkable artist Ina D.D. Uhthoff, linking her to the social and cultural worlds spanning Victoria, the Kootenays and Scotland. Johnson-Dean layers the fledgling art scene in British Columbia alongside personalities both well-known and newly rediscovered, teaching us about the times through rich and individualized voices. This beautifully illustrated, foundational study gives life to the early to mid-twentieth-century artistic scene, a period often omitted in scholarship.”—<strong>Kathryn Bridge</strong>, author, archivist and manager at the British Columbia Archives, Royal BC Museum</p><p> </p><p>“For a variety of reasons, the work of many competent artists has never been shown in public exhibitions or been the subject of professional critiques during their lifetimes. Fertig is redressing this lack in the beautifully designed, articulate monographs in her new series, ensuring each subject a well-deserved permanent place in the public realm.”–<strong>Ann Rosenberg</strong>, Vancouver freelance critic and curator</p><p> </p><p> “Until now, Edythe Hembroff-Schleicher has been known in the broader Canadian art world only as the author of two wonderful books on Emily Carr, essential volumes in their field. With this book, we discover a Hembroff who was deeply involved in the art scene in British Columbia over a long period of time. During this involvement, she struggled through chronic illness, the Depression, World War II, earning a living, a number of relocations, several marriages and changing attitudes to women and the arts. Her work merits the study this book brings. Another significant aspect of Canadian art history revealed once again by Mother Tongue’s Unheralded Artists of BC series.”—<strong>Dennis Reid</strong>, professor, History of Art, University of Toronto, and author of A Concise History of Canadian Painting</p><p> </p><p>“This (David Marshall) is a significant work in the sociology of art in Canada.”–<strong>George F. Drake</strong>, retired professor of Sociology, founder of Big Rock Garden Sculpture Committee, Bellingham, USA</p><p> </p><p>“Thornton’s portrait collection is one of the most important historical documents of the twentieth century in Canada, particularly as it relates to the First Nations.”– <strong>Anthony Westbridge</strong>, Westbridge Fine Art Ltd.</p><p> </p><p>""Fertig deserves far more support than she has so far for this fascinating &amp; noble project""-<strong>Robert Amos</strong>, artist and writer</p><p> </p><p>“Regional art histories are the foundational building blocks of the ever-evolving national narrative. Without a confident understanding of these local scenes, we can never speak authoritatively of the nature of our national accomplishment. In this regard, Mother Tongue’s new series must be enthusiastically applauded.”–<strong>Dennis Reid</strong>, professor, History of Art, University of Toronto, and author of A Concise History of Canadian Painting</p><p> </p><p>“Contemporary and friend of Emily Carr, pioneering BC artist, art educator, critic and journalist, Ina Uhthoff is central to the history of twentieth century art in British Columbia. Her work features in private collections and public galleries, but in this book, Christina Johnson-Dean brings Uhthoff’s art and life into public focus today. A rich and rewarding read for both the specialist and layperson interested in this foundational era of Western Canadian art.”—<strong>Martin Segger</strong>, former director of the Maltwood Art Museum and Gallery at the University of Victoria</p><p> </p><p>""The Unheralded Artists of BC series is a treasure. These books bring to light artists unfairly forgotten whose works amply reward our attention. Exquisitely produced, the series is an illuminating and inspiring resource for scholars, curators, artists and any reader with an interest in the diverse history of the visual arts in Canada.""–<strong>Bob MacIntyre</strong>, preparator/exhibition coordinator, Burnaby Art Gallery</p><p> </p><p>“Having performed as an art museum director and curator as well as a visual arts journalist and art historian on both sides of the 49th parallel for over forty years, I must admit that I have not, during that reflective period of time, ever experienced a more compelling, fascinating and original series of visual art publications than The Unheralded Artists of BC, a thoughtful and much-welcomed initiative.”–<strong>Brooks Joyner</strong>, director, Allentown Art Museum, USA</p><p> </p><p>“Every gallery owner or curator interested in Canadian art history should welcome this significant series, which opens, for the first time, the door on unacknowledged artists and their forgotten legacies.”–<strong>Barrie Mowatt</strong>, President, Vancouver Biennale</p><p> </p><p>“Edythe Hembroff-Schleicher will forever be known for her connection to Emily Carr, and this wonderful study illuminates much about that relationship. Hembroff-Schleicher was part of Carr’s life but also part of Carr’s legacy—the first to write a book-length appreciation of her work. Yet, as Christina Johnson-Dean reveals, Hembroff-Schleicher was a remarkable talent in her own right. With great ingenuity, she found a way to forge a career for herself as an artist, translator and writer. Much more than a footnote in Canadian Art history.”—<strong>Susan Crean</strong>, author of The Laughing One: A Journey to Emily Carr, nominated for a Governor General’s Award in Literature.</p><p> </p><p>“The Webbs were among an important group of artists, poets and musicians to emerge in post-war Vancouver. Their abstraction was informed by prevailing trends in America and Europe but looked toward urban themes and nature with titles like Low Rent District and The Purchase of a Potted Pine by a Rare Bird. This book brings to light the valuable contributions they made to the emergence of contemporary art in Vancouver.”—<strong>Darrin Morrison</strong>, director/curator, West Vancouver Museum</p><p> </p><p>“By publishing the Unheralded Artists of British Columbia series, Mother Tongue is making an impressive contribution to our visual art history.”—<strong>Gary Sim</strong>, editor/researcher for B.C. Artists</p><p> </p><p>“Our art museums and public galleries in many cases do not organize the retrospectives that our senior artists past and present deserve, in order that we may appreciate their accomplishment and situate it intelligently within the narrative of our aesthetic cuture. This series is one way to restore the balance for at least some of our artists.”–<strong>Barry Lord</strong>, Co-President, Lord Cultural Resources, Toronto</p><p> </p><p>“Harry and Jessie Webb’s work, a blending of abstraction with landscape, still life or figurative elements, is playful, yet very solid in composition. They echo Matisse and Picasso, who riffed off each other for decades. Their art also parallels that of other pioneering modern painters in Vancouver such as John Koerner, B.C. Binning, Don Jarvis and Lionel Thomas.”—<strong>Gregg Simpson</strong>, British Columbian artist</p><p> </p><p>“It is too easy to dismiss historical British Columbian art as insignificant. Work created prior to the 1970s tends to be relegated to the unimportant bin. Although unknown, many artists from the late nineteenth century through to the twentieth century laid the foundations for current art to flourish. The Unheralded Artists of BC will do a great deal to change our collective amnesia.”–<strong>Letia Richardson</strong> (1943-2010), curator and writer</p><p> </p><p>“This remarkable series on the forgotten history of visual art in what Peter Busby calls the ‘defensive, narrow-minded and cheap’ provincial backwater of the Vancouver of half a century ago is enriched by this affectionate and insightful survey of the life and work of Jack Akroyd. Akroyd’s quiet determination to cleave to his own creative principles, fashionable or not, and the constant difficulties he faced in the hardscrabble freelancer’s struggle to make a living are evocatively sketched. We are left with a touching glimpse of his corner of the world in the ‘backwater’—and a glimpse, too, of the groundwork that was being laid for the creative powerhouse the city was to become.”–<strong>Max Wyman</strong>, author, The Deﬁant Imagination: Why Culture Matters</p><p> </p><p>“A contemporary of Vancouver artists Shadbolt and Smith, Akroyd was deeply inﬂuenced by the culture of Japan, a country that embraced his artistic vision and inspired the idiosyncratic vocabulary of images from his travels and daily life which he called ‘visual diaries.’ The Burnaby Art Gallery has long championed Akroyd’s art, and is delighted that his work is ﬁnally getting its due.”–<strong>Ellen van Eijnsbergen</strong>, Director/Curator, Burnaby Art Gallery</p><p> </p><p> “Busby has delved deeply into the cultural milieu of the thirty-year period during which Akroyd produced his distinctively personal oeuvre to present us with a well-researched, well-written and insightful analysis of Jack Akroyd’s art. We are reminded that our art history is written not only by the ‘big names’ of an era.”–<strong>Nicholas Tuele</strong>, art historian and consultant</p><p> </p><p>“Mary Filer was a 20th-century prairie-born Canadian who became recognized as a professional artist both abroad and at home. Initially trained as a painter, Filer took aspects of painting, such as the layering of colour and the effect of light, and applied them three-dimensionally through the construction and lamination of various patterned and tinted shapes of cold glass. Her lifelong association with architecture and its structural inﬂuence is evident in her beautifully designed sculptural works. Painter and sculptor have merged, transforming Mary Filer into one of most innovative artists of her time.”—<strong>Richard Marcus</strong>, President of the Sculptors’ Society of British Columbia</p><p> </p><p>“The essential purity and honest abstraction of Mary Filer’s glass sculpture developed from her early European-style training as a visual artist, and her exuberant use of colour and work with light reﬂect the Montreal inﬂuence of non-representational painterly experimentation and invention. Her importance in the Canadian and international glass art movement is monumental.”—<strong>Sylvia Tait</strong>, Canadian artist</p><p> </p></div>","Introduction""... the small but mighty Mother Tongue Publishing""- Kerry Clare, Pickle Me This Canadian poet Mona Fertig has played a prominent role in the West Coast literary community for over forty years. In 1990 Mona and her husband, Renaissance man Peter Haase, moved from Vancouver to Salt Spring Island with their children and established (m)Other Tongue Press in their basement studio–first as a vibrant private press publishing gorgeous limited editions of Canadian poetry and book art, with letterpress and artwork by Peter–then evolving into a literary & art trade publisher when Mona decided it was time to bring her history and literary skills to the fore (her father was a brilliant but forgotten Vancouver artist) and shine a spotlight on the Unheralded Artists of British Columbia.The Unheralded Artists of B.C. (UABC) is an unprecedented series of beautifully designed and well-researched books, illustrating and illuminating the lives and art of previously undocumented important artists of the 1900s-1960s, (there were over 17,000 artists working in B.C. during that time). Each book is printed in full colour and contains– months of research, over 100 images, an introduction, exhibition list, endnotes and index. The books are well-written by deeply committed B.C. writers and the stories are engaging and important.Now, after nine years of hard work, amazing art sleuthing adventures; working with wonderful writers and artist’s families, great book celebrations and exhibitions, all while walking a financial tightrope, we are now reaching out for support for the publication of the next two titles, #9 and #10, in this unprecedented seriesIt is a big undertaking for a small publisher (one-woman office) to continue with such a visionary and labour intensive project without greater support. The artists featured are not famous or well-known, so it has been hard to match expenses with book sales, but that is exactly why these books are important; these artists inform the deeper narrative of our cultural history. This series is presently sustained by the passionate dedication of writers and freelance workers and self-sacrifice (Mona is the unpaid publisher) plus small grants and book sales. At Mother Tongue, quality is key, good writing and research is important and the books must be beautiful. Two titles have been finalists for the Roderick Haig-Brown Regional Prize and the Victoria Butler Book Prize, and the series can be found in better bookstores, libraries or ordered on-line from our website. Our sales are represented in North America by Heritage Group Distribution.The donations received for this campaign will give us the funds to complete production and publication of the extraordinary Life and Art of Mary Filer-UABC #9 by Christina Johnson-Dean, due out in October 2016, and help us move forward on the remarkable Life and Art of Arthur Pitts-UABC #10 by Kerry Mason, due out in October 2017.We hope you value the series and will support it and spread the word.

During the 1950s, Filer studied under Group of Seven artist Arthur Lismer and painter John Lyman and taught university art. Filer moved to Victoria and Vancouver in the 60s where she was on the forefront of the glass art movement. Her involvement with architects and her partnership with Harold Spence-Sales, who started the first School of Urban Planning in Canada at McGill University, led to an honourary doctorate from Simon Fraser University in 1991 and an Allied Arts Silver Medal from the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada in 1992. Major examples of her cold glass sculpture are at SFU Harbour Centre and the Vancouver General Hospital. Her work is in numerous collections, including the National Gallery of Canada, the Toronto Art Gallery, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria. This is an important story about an often neglected genre of Canadian art history.Christina Johnson-Dean graduated from the University of California (B.A. in History, Art) and trained as a teacher. After teaching and travelling around the world, she settled in Victoria, B.C. to be near family. At the University of Victoria, she completed an MA (History in Art), serving as a teaching assistant and creating courses in local art history for Continuing Studies. Her publications include The Crease Family: A Record of Settlement and Service in British Columbia (B.C. Archives, 1981), “B.C. Women Artists 1885-1920” in British Columbia Women Artists (Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, 1985), and The Life and Art of Ina D.D. Uhthoﬀ and The Life and Art of Edythe Hembroﬀ-Schleicher (Mother Tongue Publishing, 2012, 2013).  Partial Adventures in Space 1 by Mary Filer, n.d., laminated clear, antique and shelled float glass, 14 1/2"" x 22"" x 13  1/2"", Private Collection.Mary Filer at Dawson College, St. John, Quebec, 1946 OCTOBER 2017–The Life and Art of Arthur Pitts by Kerry Mason: Arthur Pitts (1889-1972) was born in London, UK, at the end of the Victorian age and pursued a career of art and adventure, first in South Africa, then Canada. His early fascination with indigenous cultures led him on a lifelong quest to document in vibrant watercolours, sketches and photographs what Western society perceived to be “vanishing peoples,” just as George Catlin, Paul Kane, Edward Curtis and Emily Carr had also done. Pitts also created an entire series of landscapes, portraits and architectural subjects, commercial work and hundreds of cartoons for Punch magazine. Travelling more than 4,000 miles in British Columbia and Alaska, he produced a large body of work focusing on Coast Salish, Tlingit and Ktunaxa First Nations. Pitts’ fascinating story includes life as an artist in Vancouver in the 1920s and 1930s, where he attended the Vancouver School of Decorative and Applied Arts, studying under Fred Varley, Charles Scott and J.W.G. Macdonald; WWI trench warfare and a host of “struggle and prevail” adventures. His work is in the collections of the Royal BC Museum, the Glenbow Museum and several important private collections abroad. His story and art will be revealed for the first time.Kerry Mason, B.A. M.A. is an art historian, author, curator and art consultant who lectures at the University of Victoria, University of Colorado, the Victoria College of Art and Vancouver Island School of Art, offering courses on Canada and British Columbia with a particular emphasis on Emily Carr and Indigenous Arts of the Northwest Coast. Kerry has  written many related articles, exhibit catalogues and a book, Sunlight in the Shadows: the landscape of Emily Carr, for Oxford University Press.  She has curated more than fifty exhibitions for the University of Victoria and other institutions throughout North America.Blanket of Haida Princess, circa 1930, watercolour by Arthur Pitts What We Need and Where It’s Going Expenses are high for each Unheralded Artists of BC title. We publish one title a year. The grants we receive cover some editing and design costs, but not the writer’s research; nor all the editing, which includes indexing, endnotes and multiple copyedits and proofing; and permission charges for images as well as photography. They also do not cover the publisher’s honorarium, or all printing costs ( full colour, we keep our printing in Canada) and promotion for the series, which is key for its sustainability. The writer receives a small advance, 10% of royalties on sales and a standard contract.  Here is a breakdown of expenses for UABC titles #9 and #10:Editorial/Permissions/Photography: $5,000Production and Design: $4,000Printing and Binding: $13,000Marketing: $6,000Research and Travel: $2,000Total budget for 2 UABC books: $30,000We need to raise $20,000 for our campaign, and will apply for funding for $10,000 from arts councils. If we go beyond our goal, funds will go towards further promotion of the series and to paying the publisher, Mona Fertig, an honorarium towards her living expenses, as publishing is her full time job. What You Will Receive in Return During the campaign, we will be offering 35 amazing perks! Perks are gifts and incentives you receive when you make a donation. These perks will include our beautiful published books ( fiction, poetry, art), historical art by a variety of BC artists–Jack Akroyd, Takao Tanabe, George Fertig, Jack Hardman, Irene Hoffar Reid, Marguerite Pinney, Harry & Jessie Webb, Peter Paul Ochs, Rob Steeves, Mary Filer; our signed and numbered limited editions (letterpress and bookart); time to write or just get away in our lovely cosy Seaview Retreat on Salt Spring Island; Happy Hour with us in our sun porch on Salt Spring; a selection of UABC cards or custom printed letterpressed ""Thank-you' cards; and an introduction to letterpress printing workshop for two, by Peter in our letterpress printing studio. We will run our campaign for 33 days. If we reach out goal of $20,000 it will become an InDemand Campaign and people can still continue to donate and receive Perks after that date. If we do not reach our goal, we will still receive the amount raised, but the campaign will not become an InDemand Campaign. Here are our Perks.

He is one of a generation of late modernists who have just left us–one thinks of Chillida or Oteiza in Spain, for example–whose work will endure. His accomplishment deserves to be better known in Canada, and at its best merits recognition worldwide.”–Barry Lord, President of Lord Cultural Resources “Mother Tongue is to be congratulated for launching its timely Unheralded Artists of BC series.”-Maria Tippett, author “Mona Fertig and her series Unheralded Artists of British Columbia has made a wonderful start on filling the gaps in our art history. There are lots of the unheralded in B.C. art, and I’m hoping that this series will go on and on.” –Cheryl Siegel, former Librarian/Archivist, Vancouver Art Gallery “You are doing a great service for the cultural history of British Columbia by publishing these books, and I marvel that you can do it on such a modest budget.”–Michael J. Audain, The Audain Foundation  “Mildred Valley Thonrton’s work is a documentation of an era…. I think she should have received the Order of Canada, but she didn’t live long enough.”—Christian Corbet, artist, historian and founder of the Canadian Portrait Academy  “She (Mildred Valley Thornton) was gutsy. Her work reminds me a little of the freshness of Tom Thomson’s. She was really, really good. I hope she gets some recognition now.”—Gordon Smith, Canadian artist “In a province with thousands of wonderful unheralded artists, Mother Tongue Publishing’s project is an important beginning to what will no doubt become a really significant series of books.” –Bill Jeffries, former Director, SFU Gallery “Your father (George Fertig) was a mystic really. He had a clairvoyance of a very unusual and remarkable kind. He didn’t sell it. He didn’t advertise it. But he painted it.”—Leonard Woods, artist, teacher, writer “The Burnaby Art Gallery is delighted to be a contributing partner in the George Fertig project. As an art gallery dedicated to British Columbia’s emerging and established artists, it is with great pleasure that we are able to include one of Mother Tongue Publishing’s unheralded artists within our exhibition program. Spiritually inspired and meticulously crafted, Fertig’s paintings seek to challenge each viewer to contemplate the relationships that exist between time and space and the subjects he has chosen to represent.” —Darrin Martens; former Director/Curator Burnaby Art Gallery “Unfortunately, not all artists get recognition during their lifetime. George Fertig is a good example of a ﬁne painter whose sensible handling of both palette and perspective captured the BC landscape and who is only now being discovered. My painting of English Bay is a joy to live with and I observe the artist’s love of the subject every time I look at it.”—Uno Langmann; collector, art dealer “Artist Ina Uhthoff, like her friend Emily Carr, held a passionate desire to see a permanent gallery in Victoria where people could experience art that reflected the modern era. At mid-century when the capital city had very little art presence, she was a driving force in support of founding what would become the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria. Her role in establishing the Gallery’s permanent home and hiring its first curator/director, Colin Graham, cannot be underestimated.”—Mary Jo Hughes, former chief curator, Art Gallery of Greater Victoria “I was captured by the opening line and held fast til the last word. Christina Johnson-Dean has created a wonderfully lively, fast-moving, detailed life story of the remarkable artist Ina D.D. Uhthoff, linking her to the social and cultural worlds spanning Victoria, the Kootenays and Scotland. Johnson-Dean layers the fledgling art scene in British Columbia alongside personalities both well-known and newly rediscovered, teaching us about the times through rich and individualized voices. This beautifully illustrated, foundational study gives life to the early to mid-twentieth-century artistic scene, a period often omitted in scholarship.”—Kathryn Bridge, author, archivist and manager at the British Columbia Archives, Royal BC Museum “For a variety of reasons, the work of many competent artists has never been shown in public exhibitions or been the subject of professional critiques during their lifetimes. Fertig is redressing this lack in the beautifully designed, articulate monographs in her new series, ensuring each subject a well-deserved permanent place in the public realm.”–Ann Rosenberg, Vancouver freelance critic and curator  “Until now, Edythe Hembroff-Schleicher has been known in the broader Canadian art world only as the author of two wonderful books on Emily Carr, essential volumes in their field. With this book, we discover a Hembroff who was deeply involved in the art scene in British Columbia over a long period of time. During this involvement, she struggled through chronic illness, the Depression, World War II, earning a living, a number of relocations, several marriages and changing attitudes to women and the arts. Her work merits the study this book brings. Another significant aspect of Canadian art history revealed once again by Mother Tongue’s Unheralded Artists of BC series.”—Dennis Reid, professor, History of Art, University of Toronto, and author of A Concise History of Canadian Painting “This (David Marshall) is a significant work in the sociology of art in Canada.”–George F. Drake, retired professor of Sociology, founder of Big Rock Garden Sculpture Committee, Bellingham, USA “Thornton’s portrait collection is one of the most important historical documents of the twentieth century in Canada, particularly as it relates to the First Nations.”– Anthony Westbridge, Westbridge Fine Art Ltd. ""Fertig deserves far more support than she has so far for this fascinating & noble project""-Robert Amos, artist and writer “Regional art histories are the foundational building blocks of the ever-evolving national narrative. Without a confident understanding of these local scenes, we can never speak authoritatively of the nature of our national accomplishment. In this regard, Mother Tongue’s new series must be enthusiastically applauded.”–Dennis Reid, professor, History of Art, University of Toronto, and author of A Concise History of Canadian Painting “Contemporary and friend of Emily Carr, pioneering BC artist, art educator, critic and journalist, Ina Uhthoff is central to the history of twentieth century art in British Columbia. Her work features in private collections and public galleries, but in this book, Christina Johnson-Dean brings Uhthoff’s art and life into public focus today. A rich and rewarding read for both the specialist and layperson interested in this foundational era of Western Canadian art.”—Martin Segger, former director of the Maltwood Art Museum and Gallery at the University of Victoria ""The Unheralded Artists of BC series is a treasure. These books bring to light artists unfairly forgotten whose works amply reward our attention. Exquisitely produced, the series is an illuminating and inspiring resource for scholars, curators, artists and any reader with an interest in the diverse history of the visual arts in Canada.""–Bob MacIntyre, preparator/exhibition coordinator, Burnaby Art Gallery “Having performed as an art museum director and curator as well as a visual arts journalist and art historian on both sides of the 49th parallel for over forty years, I must admit that I have not, during that reflective period of time, ever experienced a more compelling, fascinating and original series of visual art publications than The Unheralded Artists of BC, a thoughtful and much-welcomed initiative.”–Brooks Joyner, director, Allentown Art Museum, USA “Every gallery owner or curator interested in Canadian art history should welcome this significant series, which opens, for the first time, the door on unacknowledged artists and their forgotten legacies.”–Barrie Mowatt, President, Vancouver Biennale “Edythe Hembroff-Schleicher will forever be known for her connection to Emily Carr, and this wonderful study illuminates much about that relationship. Hembroff-Schleicher was part of Carr’s life but also part of Carr’s legacy—the first to write a book-length appreciation of her work. Yet, as Christina Johnson-Dean reveals, Hembroff-Schleicher was a remarkable talent in her own right. With great ingenuity, she found a way to forge a career for herself as an artist, translator and writer. Much more than a footnote in Canadian Art history.”—Susan Crean, author of The Laughing One: A Journey to Emily Carr, nominated for a Governor General’s Award in Literature. “The Webbs were among an important group of artists, poets and musicians to emerge in post-war Vancouver. Their abstraction was informed by prevailing trends in America and Europe but looked toward urban themes and nature with titles like Low Rent District and The Purchase of a Potted Pine by a Rare Bird. This book brings to light the valuable contributions they made to the emergence of contemporary art in Vancouver.”—Darrin Morrison, director/curator, West Vancouver Museum “By publishing the Unheralded Artists of British Columbia series, Mother Tongue is making an impressive contribution to our visual art history.”—Gary Sim, editor/researcher for B.C. Artists “Our art museums and public galleries in many cases do not organize the retrospectives that our senior artists past and present deserve, in order that we may appreciate their accomplishment and situate it intelligently within the narrative of our aesthetic cuture. This series is one way to restore the balance for at least some of our artists.”–Barry Lord, Co-President, Lord Cultural Resources, Toronto “Harry and Jessie Webb’s work, a blending of abstraction with landscape, still life or figurative elements, is playful, yet very solid in composition. They echo Matisse and Picasso, who riffed off each other for decades. Their art also parallels that of other pioneering modern painters in Vancouver such as John Koerner, B.C. Binning, Don Jarvis and Lionel Thomas.”—Gregg Simpson, British Columbian artist “It is too easy to dismiss historical British Columbian art as insignificant. Work created prior to the 1970s tends to be relegated to the unimportant bin. Although unknown, many artists from the late nineteenth century through to the twentieth century laid the foundations for current art to flourish. The Unheralded Artists of BC will do a great deal to change our collective amnesia.”–Letia Richardson (1943-2010), curator and writer “This remarkable series on the forgotten history of visual art in what Peter Busby calls the ‘defensive, narrow-minded and cheap’ provincial backwater of the Vancouver of half a century ago is enriched by this affectionate and insightful survey of the life and work of Jack Akroyd. Akroyd’s quiet determination to cleave to his own creative principles, fashionable or not, and the constant difficulties he faced in the hardscrabble freelancer’s struggle to make a living are evocatively sketched. We are left with a touching glimpse of his corner of the world in the ‘backwater’—and a glimpse, too, of the groundwork that was being laid for the creative powerhouse the city was to become.”–Max Wyman, author, The Deﬁant Imagination: Why Culture Matters “A contemporary of Vancouver artists Shadbolt and Smith, Akroyd was deeply inﬂuenced by the culture of Japan, a country that embraced his artistic vision and inspired the idiosyncratic vocabulary of images from his travels and daily life which he called ‘visual diaries.’ The Burnaby Art Gallery has long championed Akroyd’s art, and is delighted that his work is ﬁnally getting its due.”–Ellen van Eijnsbergen, Director/Curator, Burnaby Art Gallery  “Busby has delved deeply into the cultural milieu of the thirty-year period during which Akroyd produced his distinctively personal oeuvre to present us with a well-researched, well-written and insightful analysis of Jack Akroyd’s art. We are reminded that our art history is written not only by the ‘big names’ of an era.”–Nicholas Tuele, art historian and consultant “Mary Filer was a 20th-century prairie-born Canadian who became recognized as a professional artist both abroad and at home. Initially trained as a painter, Filer took aspects of painting, such as the layering of colour and the effect of light, and applied them three-dimensionally through the construction and lamination of various patterned and tinted shapes of cold glass. Her lifelong association with architecture and its structural inﬂuence is evident in her beautifully designed sculptural works. Painter and sculptor have merged, transforming Mary Filer into one of most innovative artists of her time.”—Richard Marcus, President of the Sculptors’ Society of British Columbia “The essential purity and honest abstraction of Mary Filer’s glass sculpture developed from her early European-style training as a visual artist, and her exuberant use of colour and work with light reﬂect the Montreal inﬂuence of non-representational painterly experimentation and invention. Her importance in the Canadian and international glass art movement is monumental.”—Sylvia Tait, Canadian artist",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What this campaign is about: <br/>
</h3>     The goal of this campaign is to raise funds for the digital art tool of my dreams: <b>Wacom Cintiq 27QHD</b>, via  <b>PERKS</b> I created. It would help me beyond words  in my freelancer endeavour to earn my living through digital painting.    I dared to imagine so many times the creative flow an artist could have 
on such  ""magical painting tool,"" in spite of the later bitter feeling 
of finding it beyond my reach.<br/><p></p>

      If you enjoy my humble art and consider my dream not too daring, please 
join this campaign and help me aquire the Wacom Cintique graphic tablet.
<p>     I feel pregnant with so much beauty, imagination, intense feelings and deep empathic emotions, all waiting to flow outside like a river, with the right tool to channel them out.</p>
<p>     I want to thank you all for any good vibration or kind gesture. I can imagine a future where empathy and kindness would be the solid bridges upon persons. . . where beautiful minds and warm hearts are not let to be wasted in poverty and solitude, for the lack of resourses. I believe mankind deserve an age of abundence, in which all could have a chance to bloom and share their inner beauty, as inspired artists of their own lives.</p>
<br/>
<p> </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>     If by some too generous support, most of perks that involve hand-made artworks would abound, the delivery may be delayed  more than specified, as  I am the only one who hand-craft all the rewards.<br/><br/>     I am a honorable person and I will fulfill every promise. For me, the good vibrations sent to me, when my name comes into one's mind, matter more than any money.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>     I very much understand that some of you just can't afford to contribute. But that doesn't mean you can't help: using the Indiegogo share tools,  you can spread the word about this campaign and with few good intentioned clicks make the difference in a life. <br/></p>

Also include Indiegogo's FEES + related ~ 8-10%     If by your overwhelming kindness the ammount raised would happen to exeed the goal of this campaign, all the rest of the money would be used on further illustrating my fantasy short-story ""Tale of Butterflies and Worms"" and all contributors will receive it in PDF/Kindle format upon completion. (details further below)
About Me:
      I'm Iosif Chezan, a digital and traditional painter from Romania, as well in love with poetry, literature and philosophy. I love to blend colors, shapes, symbols, and words, in my humble trying to bloom catharsis.  
-My digital art portfolio: http://iosifchezan.deviantart.com/gallery   





-My traditional art portfolio:  http://www.divine-icons.com
      To translate my vision into digital art, I used an old Trust graphic tablet, which at the moment needs repair  It served me well a good period, but lately burned my neurons.


I always dreamed of a Wacom Cintique, but I never afforded to take a step toward it, in my fight to be a responsable father of two wonderful children. (David, my little  boy is stuck with elements of autism spectre; in contrast to other countries, specific autism therapy for recovery is not for free  in Romania, but very costly every month).    





What this campaign is about: 
     The goal of this campaign is to raise funds for the digital art tool of my dreams: Wacom Cintiq 27QHD, via  PERKS I created. It would help me beyond words  in my freelancer endeavour to earn my living through digital painting.    I dared to imagine so many times the creative flow an artist could have 
on such  ""magical painting tool,"" in spite of the later bitter feeling 
of finding it beyond my reach.
     With the risk of ruining my modesty, I will add that I was 6 times semi-finalist (top 25 from thousands entries) on the DeviantArt.com international contests, last of which was held by Blizzard Entertaiment - Hero Of the Storm Fan Art Contest. Not to spam here, I will write in a bottom addentum all the proving links. 
  Original link : http://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-displays/cintiq-27-qhd-touch  Here is the reseller i found to offer warranty in my country: http://www.cel.ro/tablete-grafice/tableta-grafi...  Here, the cost of the graphic tablet itself is about 2970 $.   Indiegoo would take about 5% of the founds raised + thrid part fees about 3-5% + other exchange currency fees - see this article about fees and pricing https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204456408-How-much-does-Indiegogo-cost-Fees-PricingTo cover everything, a safe amount to be raised would be about  3350 $ (3350 minus aprox. 10% equals  3015$ that i guess can support currency exchange fees)What would you get - with visual exxamples:     I do not ask for your precious help without trying to repay your kind gesture in my own humble way, as an artist: take a look at the PERKS  I created. You may find some of them quite tempting, as they include :

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ Dedication* on the preview cover print of my short-story ""Tale of Butterflies and Worms"" (book under on-going illustration process):


*If by your overwhelming kindness the ammount raised would exeed the goal of this campaign, all the rest of the money would be used on further illustrating of ""Tale of Butterflies and Worms."" There, above
the veils of symbols, contrasting scenes, dilemma situations  or epic flow of adventures, I try to depict
an overview to existence and a scale of values to thrill the mind of the
reader… values which received on the back wings of both emotion and reason, (in
my subjective eyes) could shape a much more beautiful, fair and empathetic world
of humanity. I add blow some ""behind the scene"" already  illustrated pages- paired two by two:




      If you enjoy my humble art and consider my dream not too daring, please 
join this campaign and help me aquire the Wacom Cintique graphic tablet.
     I feel pregnant with so much beauty, imagination, intense feelings and deep empathic emotions, all waiting to flow outside like a river, with the right tool to channel them out.
     I want to thank you all for any good vibration or kind gesture. I can imagine a future where empathy and kindness would be the solid bridges upon persons. . . where beautiful minds and warm hearts are not let to be wasted in poverty and solitude, for the lack of resourses. I believe mankind deserve an age of abundence, in which all could have a chance to bloom and share their inner beauty, as inspired artists of their own lives.

 
  Risks & Challenges     If by some too generous support, most of perks that involve hand-made artworks would abound, the delivery may be delayed  more than specified, as  I am the only one who hand-craft all the rewards.     I am a honorable person and I will fulfill every promise. For me, the good vibrations sent to me, when my name comes into one's mind, matter more than any money.
  Other Ways You Can Help      I very much understand that some of you just can't afford to contribute. But that doesn't mean you can't help: using the Indiegogo share tools,  you can spread the word about this campaign and with few good intentioned clicks make the difference in a life.

<p>The Blues are the true facts of life told in words and songs of inspiration, emotion and feeling. TheBlues is a living organism. It was never meant to be confined to a museum. It
was meant to be played live and transmitted by human beings who love to play and listen to the blues. The CBAS plan to have a Living Blues Museum where musicians will introduce audiences to great blues musicians of the past</p>
<p>Now you
can do your part. You can contribute to the CBAS’s crowdfunding campaign on
Indiegogo. The ULCC's educational centers funded by CBAS’s efforts will be a place where the Blues are taught, performed, studied, and enjoyed by generation after generation.   It's hard to imagine a Bob Dylan, a Mick Jagger or even a hit Broadway show like ""Hamilton"" had there not been for Willie Dixon,Muddy Waters or a Howlin' Wolf or Chuck Berry. </p>

Hi! We are Beata and David, a just married couple of professional artists based in London.

Beata's website




David's website



We are delighted to have been selected among hundreds of applications to get an artist residency at Arteles Creative Center in Hämeenkyrö, Finland! So we will have access to the art studio facilities and we will spend the whole January 2016   creating new works directly inspired by the very mystical and fascinating nature of Finland. 

It will be a very cold and dark winter, perfect environment for the  art residency's main theme called ""Silence, Awareness, Existence"". We are really excited about it!

With extensive experience in the arts, we have decided to open an art space/ gallery/ studios in Phliadelphia, MS. And we need your help.</h3>

<h3>The building we found is on Main Street on our town square.

<p>The wall is located at the intersection of North Davidson and Parkwood, which marks the entrance of the North Davidson neighborhood- or more fondly, NoDa.

The outer wall of Joe’s Doughs is a vast blank canvas- and we want the community to paint it! </p>

<b><h3>The Specifics</h3></b><p>This 840 square foot wall faces the intersection of Parkwood &amp; North Davidson; adjacent the to new Parkwood Station on the blue line extension.

Improvisation is a fantastic skill to have in performance, as it shakes individuals lose of their inhibitions and worries and instead enables them to trust their instincts and welcome the unknown in order to make fantastic discoveries along the way. Combining improvisation with the mish mash of artistic disciplines holds fantastic potential! We must rid the stigma of dancers just working with dancers and musicians with musicians and instead enable individuals to embrace the unknown and build trust within artistic communities leaving the opportunity for future collaborations.Where would your money be going?Your money would be HUGELY appreciated as Fried Rice Jam could not happen without you! We would use it for:Industrial and unique space hire.FREE FRIED RICE FOR ALL!Surface materials to keep the space safe and comfortable.Art Supplies, such as painting materials, technical equipment and instruments.Promotion and advertisement of the organisation.Brand development.A money pot for future Fried Rice Jams which will taking place in the next few months (exciting!). This pot will be match funded.With £1000 we can achieve : Two more Fried Rice Jams in the next three months.                                                         Two Fried Rice Workshops for the public.                                                        A Workshop/mini jam in a location outside of Leicester                                                          in the next month!Thank you Thank you Thank you!The life of Fried Rice Jam...After the first Fried Rice Jam on the 22/01/16 the feedback we received was fantastic. Spectators and participants of the jam likened the event to the underground happenings of the 1960's and are keen for the Jams to keep happening. Here is some feedback that we received:'Where else is there for all artistic communities to come together for freeform collaboration?"" That's one thing; as free as art is, if this night could be (semi) pre-arranged it would CONQUER! Avant Garde at its most outgoing in Leicester in my experience. Quality''Much thanks to FRJ for the playful organised chaos. I liked the flow of raw participation and the accidental, but inevitable, symbiosis.'This is exactly the reason why we started Fried Rice Jam...because there was a need for it! There is a huge gap in the art industry where people can just let go of inhibition and jam for the sake of it. With the lack of open spaces in Leicester too we knew that people would love and need Fried Rice Jam.The future of Fried Rice looks bright! After receiving a loving and enthusiastic welcome from Leicester we would love to take Fried Rice to other areas of the country spreading art and love wherever we go. We just need a little bit of your help to achieve this, Thank you.Risks & Challenges: As we are young and this project is just beginning, Fried Rice has not yet been tried and tested enough so we are still learning how to make the project work. We are also aware that Fried Rice will not work in every city so we need to be selective and try this out in different areas.As Fried Rice grows in popularity we are also aware that there may be an issue with finding space to facilitate it and short listing will have to come into play for artists as demand grows.However, as Fried Rice creators we are all inspired young artists, with varying ages, interests and experience but with one unique goal, to make this project work. We doubt that no event since the 1960's underground happenings has quite the same unique edge or energy as Fried Rice does and we are so excited for THE FUTURE OF FRIED RICE JAM!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>For the past two months hundreds of volunteers and artists from the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Boston, Reno, Portland, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, France, you get the picture; have come to SF to help us construct the Catacomb of Veils. Until now, we have raised $68K toward our goal of ~$90k that will enable us to complete this sculpture and deliver it to the playa for Burning Man 2016.

<p>A path winds up to the Narthex at the Eastern Pyramid of the Catacomb and from this vantage point the community begins its descent inward.

<p>The festival will be a
celebration of creativity but with a clear focus on the brilliant
people, place, heritage and industry of Hillsborough, Sheffield. The
very first Hillsfest will take place in <b>Hillsborough Park </b>on<b> July 9<sup>th</sup>
and 10<sup>th</sup></b> this summer but the aim is to create something
that will leave a positive legacy for the local community, far beyond
the event itself.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Why
is this important? - because this area wants a change of perception.<br/></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
“<b>When I say Hillsborough what’s
the first thing you think of?”</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Sadly,
for many, the answer is still the terrible football tragedy of 1989
where 96 people lost their lives - The Hillsborough Disaster. This
was 26 years ago.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There’s
a real desire for people to come together to deliver something
entirely positive for the area.  Everyone we have spoken to is in
agreement that the disaster will always be a part of Hillsborough’s
story but moving forward there’s a need to recognise some of the
things that are truly great about this area for the
people who live and work here. Hillsborough is full of talent and has
a rich and fascinating cultural and industrial heritage. <br/></p>
<p><b>There’s
a desire to see Hillsborough re-assert its identity and re-invigorate
its sense of pride.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456576795/zdlxowf9hrpoudv2vaqc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The community feel that it’s important to involve the people of Liverpool in
this event. We want to extend the positive legacy of the festival in
building closer community ties between Liverpool and Hillsborough and
have already begun to make those links as the festival takes shape.
From arts and crafts to music making and performance we want this to
be a shared experience.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>You
can make a massive difference!</b></p>
<ul>
<li>change some of the unfair negative perceptions of this
area &amp; celebrate the enormous creativity that exists here<br/>
</li>
<li>deliver an extraordinary FREE event in the North of
Sheffield which sits next to some of the most deprived wards in the
city. <br/>
</li>
<li>highlight the talent, stories and heritage of an
area that feels it has been, to a large extent, neglected and
overlooked or overshadowed by other events.</li>
</ul>

<br/> </div> </div>","What
is Hillsfest?


Hillsfest is an ambitious FREE festival of art & music! 



The festival will be a
celebration of creativity but with a clear focus on the brilliant
people, place, heritage and industry of Hillsborough, Sheffield. The
very first Hillsfest will take place in Hillsborough Park on July 9th
and 10th this summer but the aim is to create something
that will leave a positive legacy for the local community, far beyond
the event itself.


Why
is this important? - because this area wants a change of perception.



“When I say Hillsborough what’s
the first thing you think of?”


Sadly,
for many, the answer is still the terrible football tragedy of 1989
where 96 people lost their lives - The Hillsborough Disaster. This
was 26 years ago.


There’s
a real desire for people to come together to deliver something
entirely positive for the area.  Everyone we have spoken to is in
agreement that the disaster will always be a part of Hillsborough’s
story but moving forward there’s a need to recognise some of the
things that are truly great about this area for the
people who live and work here. Hillsborough is full of talent and has
a rich and fascinating cultural and industrial heritage. 
There’s
a desire to see Hillsborough re-assert its identity and re-invigorate
its sense of pride.


The community feel that it’s important to involve the people of Liverpool in
this event. We want to extend the positive legacy of the festival in
building closer community ties between Liverpool and Hillsborough and
have already begun to make those links as the festival takes shape.
From arts and crafts to music making and performance we want this to
be a shared experience.


You
can make a massive difference!

change some of the unfair negative perceptions of this
area & celebrate the enormous creativity that exists here

deliver an extraordinary FREE event in the North of
Sheffield which sits next to some of the most deprived wards in the
city. 

highlight the talent, stories and heritage of an
area that feels it has been, to a large extent, neglected and
overlooked or overshadowed by other events.



   What We Need
 We need cash!  The more we get the more extraordinary we can make this festival.  
Extraordinary, exciting, fun and FREE!  



Hillsfest doesn't want to look like any other festival.  The desire is to transform the local park through the erection of huge 24 metre inflatable domes, each with an internal capactiy of 800 people standing. Inside and outside of which we want to deliver an exciting programme of content across various themes.

 FREE exciting content  to take place inside it, or exciting content 
within the various themed zones. 
£3K would cover the cost of bringing 2 professional glass artists, Bandits of Glass,  to offer two days worth of glass blowing demonstrations.
£1K would cover the costs of two days worth of engaging & accessible workshop delivery for people of all ages with professional artists!
£5K would cover the cost of a fantastic music stage and crew


Themes the festival aims to cover include:


Creative Showcase - exhibition space for painting, printmaking, textiles, glass, jewellery, ceramics, photography, sculpture, illustration and design. 


Makers activity - opportunities, to build, make, play and generally get 'hands on' with a wide range of media

Sound & Movement - dance, theatre and or other explorations into sound and movement in its broadest sense.

Spoken word & film  - to include poetry and various elements of spoken word and experimental and diverse film screenings suitable for a range of ages and interests.

In addition:

A modular graffiti tower - the size of a terraced house!
A sculpture symposium - live chainsaw carving!
Performances

<p>Hi, my name is Christie and I am an artist and lightworker. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Recently I’ve been guided by Archangel Michael to create a painting of him and to help him in his work by getting his image out in front of the eyes of as many people as possible.</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Just by visiting this page you can help in this project because I'm offering a free way to participate (in addition to purchasing Perks.) You can find out about it by watching the video, and I'll tell you about it again below. But first, let me explain a little about this painting and this project. </span><br/></p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462756797/Michael_the_Archangel_sm_l32tyt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If you’re with me so far you probably know who Archangel
Michael is, but in case you don't, to put it briefly he is the archangel of protection. He also helps
people find and follow their purpose.</span>
<h3><b>So what's the point of sharing this image? </b></h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Everything that exists vibrates at a certain energetic frequency. What’s more, everything we come into contact with affects our vibration. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">That means that the things you hear, touch, or see really do change you on an energetic level. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Some things affect us positively, in a healthy, uplifting way. Others negatively, in a way that is not so good for us. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Lower vibration energies (including visual images) create negative reactions within us - such as fear - that encourage us to respond from our lower, ego selves. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Higher vibration objects and experiences make it easier for our higher selves to take the lead.  And that brings us (eventually) to a life brimming with peace, love, and joy. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">So it’s really important to surround ourselves with high vibration things that will support us energetically. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">One of the things I do as a lightworker-artist is to sense spirit guides and guardian angels, then translate them into beautiful paintings that help raise people’s spiritual vibration when they are viewed.  <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>This painting resonates with the very high spiritual frequency of Michael the Archangel.</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Following the principle of resonance, viewing this image activates the Archangel Michael energy already present within you, and within the room it is displayed in.</span><b style=""background-color: initial;""> Meditating on this painting, or just having it in your space, can help shield you from lower vibration influences in your environment. </b><br/></p>
</div><div>This piece of art is also an invitation from Michael to focus on the Light. He says not to be afraid, that he and his allies will help you and support you <span style=""background-color: initial;"">when you choose to align your life choices with what your Higher Self is longing to do.</span>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<p>Michael’s energy is very real and accessible to everyone. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">But </span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">we have to be willing to allow him to help us. </i></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">And that starts with being aware of his presence, and inviting it into our lives. </span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Right now, we're at a critical turning point as the world shifts into a 
higher vibration of consciousness. More and more people are starting to 
awaken to their higher selves. However it's not an easy process and 
there is a LOT of energetic resistance. <br/></p>
<p>Personally, I've struggled with this resistance for years. From the time I was old enough to hold a crayon, I knew I was meant 
to be an artist. But somewhere along the way I became afraid to follow my dream. 
It got so bad that at one point I hardly picked up a brush for 10 
years.  <br/></p>
<p>I'm not alone. There are SO many people on the planet today with 
amazing gifts who could bring so much healing into the world. But 
they're paralyzed with fear, their gifts unrecognized and underused.<br/></p>
<p>Archangel Michael's energy is helping me - and many others - to break out of this old pattern. The more people call on him and invite his energy in, the stronger a presence it will have in the world. That's what this project is all about. Will you help?  <br/></p>
<p><b>This project will do two things: </b><br/></p>
<p><b>First,</b> it will help fund some intense spiritual training I'm taking that is getting me in closer communication with Michael and which will allow me to continue to create even more deeply healing works and through which I hope to inspire many others (maybe you?) to shake off their own resistance and move forward towards living their purpose. The funds raised in this project will also help pay for a video camera (to get time-lapse paintings out on YouTube) :-) art supplies, framing, and all the other expenses artists face. <br/></p>
<p>Here is my budget:</p>
<p>$8,000 - spiritual training and travel expenses</p>
<p>$2500 - printing costs</p>
<p>$500 - HD video camera &amp; related equipment<br/></p>
<p>$110 - art supplies (watercolor paper &amp; paint)<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Second, and most importantly, </b>it will help Archangel Michael increase his presence in the world.  Michael's energy is SO needed right now and is being brought to the forefront in so many ways to assist in clearing away negative energies and helping humanity to come to its senses! <br/></p>
<br/>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Enjoy the Love &amp; Protection of Archangel Michael in your home or office</h3>
<div>As I worked on this painting, Michael instructed me to make this image of him available and accessible to everyone. </div>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">How to Take Part in the Archangel Michael Project for FREE</h4>
<div>First of all, they won't let me offer an official Perk for free but I wanted to do everything I can to help Michael with his outreach efforts. <b>So what I've decided to do is to make <a href=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457201776/vjdlttzzrbsbskr8vwzt.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Archangel Michael image</a> I've posted above available under the Creative Commons <a href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">attribution license</a>.  </b>
</div>
<div>It's a smaller, lower resolution file than the one I'm using to create the fine art prints and Perks, but it's good enough for many purposes and certainly good enough to share online. <b>So I encourage you to post it on social media, use it on your website, or on fliers, or wherever you think Michael's energy will do the highest good.</b> <b> <a href=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457201776/vjdlttzzrbsbskr8vwzt.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Download it for free here</a>,</b> and see where Michael suggests you post it! :-) <br/><br/>(I won't require you to link back to this page, or to my <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/brightspiritart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/brightspiritart"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>, but I would very much appreciate it, and doing so will help the Project reach even more people.) <br/><br/>
</div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>How to Become a Champion Supporter</b></h3>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">You can help bring even more Michael energy into the world by purchasing one or more of the Perks at right. I’ve created a number of Perks to choose from, and </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">every Perk comes with a special blessing! :-)</b>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I want this to be affordable to everyone, so prices start at $10. Larger Perks are also available for those who feel called to support this project in a bigger way or would like a more intense infusion of Archangel Michael energy.<br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Whichever Perk calls to you, once you receive it will help you more easily tune in to Archangel Michael’s energy. This will protect you from fear and ego-based illusion, and help you stand in the Light so you can more easily realize and manifest your purpose in the world. </b></span></div>

Hi, my name is Christie and I am an artist and lightworker. 

Recently I’ve been guided by Archangel Michael to create a painting of him and to help him in his work by getting his image out in front of the eyes of as many people as possible.
Just by visiting this page you can help in this project because I'm offering a free way to participate (in addition to purchasing Perks.) You can find out about it by watching the video, and I'll tell you about it again below. But first, let me explain a little about this painting and this project. 



If you’re with me so far you probably know who Archangel
Michael is, but in case you don't, to put it briefly he is the archangel of protection. He also helps
people find and follow their purpose.
So what's the point of sharing this image? 
Everything that exists vibrates at a certain energetic frequency. What’s more, everything we come into contact with affects our vibration. That means that the things you hear, touch, or see really do change you on an energetic level. 

Some things affect us positively, in a healthy, uplifting way. Others negatively, in a way that is not so good for us. 
Lower vibration energies (including visual images) create negative reactions within us - such as fear - that encourage us to respond from our lower, ego selves. 
Higher vibration objects and experiences make it easier for our higher selves to take the lead.  And that brings us (eventually) to a life brimming with peace, love, and joy. 
So it’s really important to surround ourselves with high vibration things that will support us energetically. 
One of the things I do as a lightworker-artist is to sense spirit guides and guardian angels, then translate them into beautiful paintings that help raise people’s spiritual vibration when they are viewed.  
This painting resonates with the very high spiritual frequency of Michael the Archangel.
Following the principle of resonance, viewing this image activates the Archangel Michael energy already present within you, and within the room it is displayed in. Meditating on this painting, or just having it in your space, can help shield you from lower vibration influences in your environment. 
This piece of art is also an invitation from Michael to focus on the Light. He says not to be afraid, that he and his allies will help you and support you when you choose to align your life choices with what your Higher Self is longing to do.


Michael’s energy is very real and accessible to everyone. But we have to be willing to allow him to help us. 
And that starts with being aware of his presence, and inviting it into our lives. 
The Impact

Right now, we're at a critical turning point as the world shifts into a 
higher vibration of consciousness. More and more people are starting to 
awaken to their higher selves. However it's not an easy process and 
there is a LOT of energetic resistance. 
Personally, I've struggled with this resistance for years. From the time I was old enough to hold a crayon, I knew I was meant 
to be an artist. But somewhere along the way I became afraid to follow my dream. 
It got so bad that at one point I hardly picked up a brush for 10 
years.  
I'm not alone. There are SO many people on the planet today with 
amazing gifts who could bring so much healing into the world. But 
they're paralyzed with fear, their gifts unrecognized and underused.
Archangel Michael's energy is helping me - and many others - to break out of this old pattern. The more people call on him and invite his energy in, the stronger a presence it will have in the world. That's what this project is all about. Will you help?  
This project will do two things: 
First, it will help fund some intense spiritual training I'm taking that is getting me in closer communication with Michael and which will allow me to continue to create even more deeply healing works and through which I hope to inspire many others (maybe you?) to shake off their own resistance and move forward towards living their purpose. The funds raised in this project will also help pay for a video camera (to get time-lapse paintings out on YouTube) :-) art supplies, framing, and all the other expenses artists face. 
Here is my budget:
$8,000 - spiritual training and travel expenses
$2500 - printing costs
$500 - HD video camera & related equipment
$110 - art supplies (watercolor paper & paint)

Second, and most importantly, it will help Archangel Michael increase his presence in the world.  Michael's energy is SO needed right now and is being brought to the forefront in so many ways to assist in clearing away negative energies and helping humanity to come to its senses! 

   Enjoy the Love & Protection of Archangel Michael in your home or office
As I worked on this painting, Michael instructed me to make this image of him available and accessible to everyone. 
How to Take Part in the Archangel Michael Project for FREE
First of all, they won't let me offer an official Perk for free but I wanted to do everything I can to help Michael with his outreach efforts. So what I've decided to do is to make the Archangel Michael image I've posted above available under the Creative Commons attribution license.  

It's a smaller, lower resolution file than the one I'm using to create the fine art prints and Perks, but it's good enough for many purposes and certainly good enough to share online. So I encourage you to post it on social media, use it on your website, or on fliers, or wherever you think Michael's energy will do the highest good.  Download it for free here, and see where Michael suggests you post it! :-) (I won't require you to link back to this page, or to my Facebook page, but I would very much appreciate it, and doing so will help the Project reach even more people.) 

How to Become a Champion Supporter

You can help bring even more Michael energy into the world by purchasing one or more of the Perks at right. I’ve created a number of Perks to choose from, and every Perk comes with a special blessing! :-)

I want this to be affordable to everyone, so prices start at $10. Larger Perks are also available for those who feel called to support this project in a bigger way or would like a more intense infusion of Archangel Michael energy.
Whichever Perk calls to you, once you receive it will help you more easily tune in to Archangel Michael’s energy. This will protect you from fear and ego-based illusion, and help you stand in the Light so you can more easily realize and manifest your purpose in the world. 
The Perks are: 
$10: Archangel Michael printable calling cards. 

See full description at right. These pdf files are royalty-free and fully Photoshop-editable, so you can adapt them as you wish - even turn them into business cards if you like. If you purchase this or any Perk I will also send you a Blessing and a big Thank-You on my Facebook page. 

$20: Archangel Michael postcard. I will personally sign a postcard featuring Archangel Michael and send it to you anywhere in the world. Frame it for the perfect addition to your personal altar! You will also get the Archangel Michael Calling Card files and everything that goes with them. 


$44: Archangel Michael 11""x14"" open edition giclee print. 



Signed fine art giclee print. Details at right!

$111: Archangel Michael Art Gifting Pack. Gift Michael's love and protection all around! Package includes three signed Open Edition archival prints, and a pack of 8 Archangel Michael greeting cards (some locations outside the U.S. may receive a 4th print instead of the cards.) All make great gifts. Of course you'll also receive the Michael Calling Card package, too. This is the best deal on prints!


$200: Custom Angel drawing and intuitive reading. 



One of the things I do as a spiritual artist is to sense spirit guides and guardian angels, then translate them into a beautiful piece of art that helps raise people’s spiritual vibration when is is viewed. It’s especially resonant for the specific people I painted them for because it helps them maintain their connection with their angels, but they are effective for everyone who sees them. 

With this Perk you get a beautiful, one-of-a-kind original piece of channeled art containing the image and energy of your very own Guardian Angel, plus a personal angel reading recorded on mp3. Graphite pencil or other black-and-white media on archival fine art paper, includes Certificate of Authenticity. Read more details at right.

Printed at the same size as the original painting, this fine art print resonates with the high healing vibration of Archangel Michael to bring protection and clarity to all who enter your home. Signed and printed on archival watercolor paper under the close supervision of the artist. I am only printing 25 of these, ever, and making only 15 available at this time. Once they are sold, they will never again be available in this size or quality. Includes Certificate of Authenticity. Bonus for Indiegogo customers only: I will also include a poster print and an intuitive Angel reading recorded on mp3. (And of course you will also receive the Michael Calling Card package.)

<h2>Paint Your Freedom</h2>
<p>Hello art supporters, it exciting to take part in Galerie Miscre8 future. You are allowing our doors to open into the world of art, with your contributions. As an artist I'm truly appreciative, My name is Miscre8 i'm the creator of the intro cartoon skit above and the owner of Galerie Miscre8. People who know me, and for those who don't, Welcome to my creative roller coster ride I called my art life. I have been creating art ever since I could hold a pencil or a spray can. My art has transform into a unique style I call urban contemporary.  Becoming more aware, positive, and appreciative which lead me to take my art career in a different direction more gallery and lifestyle brand. That path lead me back to what I truly love my art. Residing in Las Vegas, I came across a small 10x10 art studio in 2010 located on the iconic Fremont St. inside a building call Emergency Arts. An old re-model medical center in las Vegas. I created Lil Art Bodega Creative a clever way to pay homage to New York City graffiti shops. The city were my art life started. Three years later I moved to a 8x20ft shipping container inside of Container Park a unique mall downtown Las Vegas.  Creating a west coast buzz for myself and my shop  business grew. I started needing more space for classes and workshop.  Now you have a quick rundown of my art life. With these blessing I have secured an amazing art space for this new gallery launch called Galerie Miscre8.</p>
<h3>Having a 800sq. foot outlet for an unorthodox Art Gallery that practice in urban contemporary art. Is needing help with the build-out of the gallery! Here's why:</h3>
<p>GALERIE MISCRE8 will operates as an artist-run space because of the freedom it affords us. Functioning as a non-commercial entity gives us the flexibility and independence in making a culture shift by exhibiting works by Female Artists focusing on bringing balance to the art world. This gives Galerie miscre8  a positive outlook and venturous work free of commercial pressures and limitations. As an experience talented professional artist with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Graphic Design my travels, exhibits, showcases, murals, graphic designs and teachings let's me give back my expertise to the young and old and everyone in between experience art in a positive and happy way.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I secured an amazing new raw space for Galerie Miscre8, it requires a bit of work.  What I did not factor in are construction work permits and the COO (certificate of occupancy) in order to open the galerie.

However, I need some help with unforeseen costs:</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While LIL ART BODEGA at Container Park, will certainly be missed, we couldn't be more excited about the opportunities to grow our sister company GALERIE MISCRE8. Here's what we're looking forward to with our re-launch:</p>

<li>More space for artwork, workshop, classes, youth program and events</li>
<li>Potential to build partnerships within local company and beyond</li>
<li>Greater exposure for the artists &amp; Six-week long exhibitions </li>

</div></div>","Paint Your Freedom
Hello art supporters, it exciting to take part in Galerie Miscre8 future. You are allowing our doors to open into the world of art, with your contributions. As an artist I'm truly appreciative, My name is Miscre8 i'm the creator of the intro cartoon skit above and the owner of Galerie Miscre8. People who know me, and for those who don't, Welcome to my creative roller coster ride I called my art life. I have been creating art ever since I could hold a pencil or a spray can. My art has transform into a unique style I call urban contemporary.  Becoming more aware, positive, and appreciative which lead me to take my art career in a different direction more gallery and lifestyle brand. That path lead me back to what I truly love my art. Residing in Las Vegas, I came across a small 10x10 art studio in 2010 located on the iconic Fremont St. inside a building call Emergency Arts. An old re-model medical center in las Vegas. I created Lil Art Bodega Creative a clever way to pay homage to New York City graffiti shops. The city were my art life started. Three years later I moved to a 8x20ft shipping container inside of Container Park a unique mall downtown Las Vegas.  Creating a west coast buzz for myself and my shop  business grew. I started needing more space for classes and workshop.  Now you have a quick rundown of my art life. With these blessing I have secured an amazing art space for this new gallery launch called Galerie Miscre8.
Having a 800sq. foot outlet for an unorthodox Art Gallery that practice in urban contemporary art. Is needing help with the build-out of the gallery! Here's why:
GALERIE MISCRE8 will operates as an artist-run space because of the freedom it affords us. Functioning as a non-commercial entity gives us the flexibility and independence in making a culture shift by exhibiting works by Female Artists focusing on bringing balance to the art world. This gives Galerie miscre8  a positive outlook and venturous work free of commercial pressures and limitations. As an experience talented professional artist with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Graphic Design my travels, exhibits, showcases, murals, graphic designs and teachings let's me give back my expertise to the young and old and everyone in between experience art in a positive and happy way.
What We Need & What You Get

I secured an amazing new raw space for Galerie Miscre8, it requires a bit of work.  What I did not factor in are construction work permits and the COO (certificate of occupancy) in order to open the galerie. This is my first experience constructing a 800q ft shell of a space by installing A/C, Electric outlets, Walls, Floor, etc. I have covered most of the costs and Me & friend are doing most of the labor & design work ourselves. However, I need some help with unforeseen costs:
WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?

$1,000 - Architecture floor plans, permits
$2,000 - Material & Labor (electrician) Outlets, Safety signs
$1000 - Signage & Marketing material
$3000 - Materials: art hanging system, tracking lights, Struts, furnishing, shelving
$1000 - Start up supplies (youth program)
$800 - other fees (indie go go's 5%, etc.)

<p>Hi my names Tim</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am a super passionate and committed visual artist. I've spent the last 11 years, studying, teaching and making studio art, public art and community art. My dream is to grow my audience base and market for my artwork to a point where sales are my main income source. This year I have been given the opportunity to have a booth at The Other Art Fair in Sydney between the 21st and 25th of March, this will mean reaching literally thousands of new viewers and potential buyers. I had to provide the money upfront but I borrowed most of it and that has left me in a difficult situation, struggling to keep my normal living costs at bay and buy framing materials, insurance and other necessary bits for the art fair.  Its not far away now and I'm getting excited but I am in need of financial assistance to help me pay back the money I have borrowed, so that I can continue to pay for my normal living costs and take time off my day jobs to drive to Sydney for a week to do the art fair. </p>
<p>The minimum booth for The Other Art Fair is $2200 Australian, I have spent around $500 on framing materials and tools so far (I'm doing it myself!!!), $280 on public liability insurance, $20 on packing materials. There are more costs on top of this but those are the major part for which I am asking assistance. These numbers total $3000 Australian but Indiegogo uses US Dollars so this equates to $2355 USD.</p>
<p>I am not the sort of person to ask for help usually, I had never dreamt of doing a crowdfunding campaign, but this is a special opportunity and I really want to make the most of it. 6 years ago I was offered to take my art to an art fair in Asia, but I turned it down due to the high costs associated with it, this time I am determined to make it happen. </p>
<p>I will very happily reward any donations/contributions by giving artwork or tutorials or both as you wish. All donations great and small are welcome and will be greatly appreciated. Even if you can only spare a very small amount, it all helps and will make this project a little easier and more productive for me.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've always been a person who loves to create things. It's been a spontaneous driving force of mine throughout my life. The raw enjoyment that comes from getting to realize my imaginings is beyond any words one could possibly use.</p>
<p>With this campaign, I hope to be able to acquire enough of a kickstart in order to begin realizing my idea into reality.</p>
<p>This campaign will help me achieve this dream and eventually allow me to create lines of various sculptures and models of various characters and personas from a multitude of different fanbases. </p>
<p>I hope to be able to give back to the people who supported me with some nifty trinkets that they can happily display on their shelves of their favorite personas and characters.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will need a minimum of approximately $600 for this first campaign in order to get the necessary supplies to begin this project successfully. The supplies will be comprised of custom packaging material for shipping completed sculpts securely in a classy way (cardboard, plastic, foam, etc), materials needed to color sculpts and packaging (paint, spray paint, enamel paints, inks), necessary materials for casts and molds with resin needed to create the sculpt replicas for order, premium sculpting clay essential to create the molds for the sculptures, hand torches and pressured cool air needed for sculpting, and tools needed for sculpting.</p>
<p>Contributors may receive a miniature sample or print as a thank you</p>
<p>Should the goal not be reached, I will utilize what funds have been attained and use them to at least acquire some materials necessary for the project (though, depending on the amount, it will depend on just how many supplies I can procure).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My project will allow me to produce custom sculptures of people's interest while getting to have fun with the experience of doing so. There are quite a lot of different ideas people have that just have not been produced! So giving people a way for their interests to be realized in sculpture form by yours truly, with direct public input, would be of rather significant interest to many.</p>
<p>I have experience with creating things and completing projects in general. Though it might not be as extensive as professionals out there, as a hobbyist/amateur, I have managed to create some rather involved works over a broad spectrum of mediums, including foam, plastic, paints, inks, digital, cgi, etc.</p>
<p>If there are ANY questions about this project whatsoever, feel absolutely free to ask me directly! I will be happy to answer all of your questions as necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It is inevitable that difficulties will arise with the pursuance of this project, whether it be deficient funding, lack of public awareness, time constraints, etc.</p>
<p>However, I am rather determined to get this project rolling as soon as possible. I have been through numerous ruts before, but from patience and determination, my passion was able to help me through the obstacles somehow.</p>
<p>In the end, I am sure that I will manage to do something regarding this project so I can finally get to offer up something new and interesting from yours truly.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Hey, I also totally understand that not everyone can contribute a donation to this kickstarter, and that's ok!</p>
<p>There is something else you can do instead, which is spread the word by sharing on your social media and with your friends, family, and peers around you!</p>

With this campaign, I hope to be able to acquire enough of a kickstart in order to begin realizing my idea into reality.
This campaign will help me achieve this dream and eventually allow me to create lines of various sculptures and models of various characters and personas from a multitude of different fanbases. 
I hope to be able to give back to the people who supported me with some nifty trinkets that they can happily display on their shelves of their favorite personas and characters.
 

What We Need & What You Get
I will need a minimum of approximately $600 for this first campaign in order to get the necessary supplies to begin this project successfully. The supplies will be comprised of custom packaging material for shipping completed sculpts securely in a classy way (cardboard, plastic, foam, etc), materials needed to color sculpts and packaging (paint, spray paint, enamel paints, inks), necessary materials for casts and molds with resin needed to create the sculpt replicas for order, premium sculpting clay essential to create the molds for the sculptures, hand torches and pressured cool air needed for sculpting, and tools needed for sculpting.
Contributors may receive a miniature sample or print as a thank you
Should the goal not be reached, I will utilize what funds have been attained and use them to at least acquire some materials necessary for the project (though, depending on the amount, it will depend on just how many supplies I can procure).

The Impact
My project will allow me to produce custom sculptures of people's interest while getting to have fun with the experience of doing so. There are quite a lot of different ideas people have that just have not been produced! So giving people a way for their interests to be realized in sculpture form by yours truly, with direct public input, would be of rather significant interest to many.
I have experience with creating things and completing projects in general. Though it might not be as extensive as professionals out there, as a hobbyist/amateur, I have managed to create some rather involved works over a broad spectrum of mediums, including foam, plastic, paints, inks, digital, cgi, etc.
If there are ANY questions about this project whatsoever, feel absolutely free to ask me directly! I will be happy to answer all of your questions as necessary.
 

Risks & Challenges
It is inevitable that difficulties will arise with the pursuance of this project, whether it be deficient funding, lack of public awareness, time constraints, etc.
However, I am rather determined to get this project rolling as soon as possible. I have been through numerous ruts before, but from patience and determination, my passion was able to help me through the obstacles somehow.
In the end, I am sure that I will manage to do something regarding this project so I can finally get to offer up something new and interesting from yours truly.

Other Ways You Can Help
Hey, I also totally understand that not everyone can contribute a donation to this kickstarter, and that's ok!
There is something else you can do instead, which is spread the word by sharing on your social media and with your friends, family, and peers around you!

<p>I'm Bobby Danger of Danger Artworks, established in 2009 in Durham, North Carolina where I was born and raised.  Art is the way I communicate with others and with the world.  It is the way I deal with the insane level of stress that comes from being black or brown in this country.  I’ve encountered racism on many levels throughout my life, both blatant and subtle, directly and indirectly.  Being the target of any kind of hate is traumatic, confusing and frightening.  No history book can prepare you for it.  We are taught that racism is always loud and obvious; it is not.  We are taught that only certain types of people are racist; this is not true.  We are taught that slavery ended and slaves were set free; our society today proves that those wounds are still wide open.  </p>
<p>In 2014, I spent a summer in New York collaborating with my best friend, Alex Ghassan.  Alex was an independent photographer, videographer and director. He filmed and edited a powerful music video for Skyzoo named “Spike Lee Was My Hero” that landed him an invitation to the official 25th Anniversary commemoration for the release of “Do The Right Thing.”  I was fortunate enough to be able to accompany him to this event and meet Spike Lee himself, which was something I never dreamed I would have the opportunity to do.  I grew up admiring him and fearing the truths he put front and center where they belong.  Meeting him was surreal. The entire experience of being in New York that summer made me realize that I could use my own talent to speak to the world and maybe even inspire a bit of much needed change.  I was moved to think of my art as my voice.  </p>
<p>Another event of 2014 gave my work a new focus and intention.   The strangulation of Eric Garner at the hands of police led me to call attention to the magnitude of this kind of social injustice in the black community.  Eric Garner’s death, like many others, truly drove home how quickly and easily lives and communities can be destroyed by the very people and things meant to protect us.  That summer in New York with Alex provided the creative energy needed to bring together an illustration I had started but was not sure how to finish.  Alex helped me brainstorm and fueled my determination to bring awareness and attention to what I could no longer be silent about.  Out of this collaboration came the completed colored pencil illustration I now call, “Say It Loud.”  I took the powerful image of the iconic character “Buggin’ Out” from “Do The Right Thing” and placed a crowd of silent protestors behind him with their hands up to demonstrate the obvious.  The juxtaposition of Buggin’ Out’s shock-filled expression against the calm, tired faces of the crowd of black men and women holding up their hands represents the backwards movement of racism that Spike Lee highlighted over three decades ago.  Tragedies caused by racism happen far too often.  As artists, I believe it is our duty to highlight and draw attention to this.</p>
<p>I finished the piece and shortly after, my friend Alex left this earth unexpectedly and far too soon.  This loss came on the tail end of two other significant losses I had experienced recently, and truly stopped me in my creative tracks.  Recently, and eerily timed with the news of the injustice served in the exoneration of Eric Garner’s killer, I came back to life with a mission and determination unmatched.  I realized that I owe it to Alex to keep the momentum this piece inspired in me.  I realized that I couldn’t give up or sit still while this is the atmosphere we still live in 30 years post release of “Do The Right Thing.”</p>
<p>So here I am.  The seed was planted for this project in 2014, and finally today it has grown into an endeavor that cannot fail. This campaign supports a collection of artwork by Bobby Danger of Danger Artworks with commentary and writing by Karen Ashley of LYTM Photography.  It will ultimately break down the message put forth in my piece “Say It Loud.”  This project will examine the various ""states"" of racism in this country.  Racism exists in corporations, armed forces, sports, housing and education and transportation.  Those in a privileged position often overlook the inequities and injustice in these areas that people of color experience every day – sometimes unintentionally.  If we are not conscious of it, we cannot change them.  This project will highlight the less obvious ways in which people of color are challenged, doubted and judged according to stereotypes or preconceived notions.</p>
<p>This project is my protest and my contribution to the collective call to all artists to keep fighting for what is right.  Those already leading the way, especially those in my hometown, inspire me as I hope to inspire others.  For now, I am ready to keep going with more determination than I have ever had.  This time, I’m not alone.</p>
<p>Joining Danger Artworks as of 2019 is, writer, editor and photographer, Karen Ashley.  Karen’s writing skills and passion for social justice align perfectly with my artistic endeavors, so we decided to join forces to double our impact. </p>
<p>Stay tuned for our blog, The United States of Racism that will document the progress of this project so that you can truly be a part of it every step of the way.  We will also use the blog to provide our followers with exclusive information on shows and products related to the cause.  Our mission is to release the final versions of the illustrations and paintings progressively until the series is complete.  We will then present the project in art shows, festivals, and other avenues to inspire others to join us stand strong against injustice in black and brown communities.  Our hope is to eventually publish a book with the final collection that will change hearts and policies alike to make this country a safer, more humane place to raise our families.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contribution will help us with the initial costs required to get this project moving.  It will support the purchase of art supplies and office/studio equipment necessary to complete unfinished artwork and to create new pieces.  If we reach our initial goal, the campaign will remain open and help us bring this project to completion sooner rather than later.  If the campaign is able to remain open, funds that continue to be raised will assist with art show preparation including custom framing of each piece.  If you'd like to see a detailed breakdown of the allocation of funds, please visit the FAQ section.  You can also support Karen and me in the following ways:</p>

<h3>Happy and Free is the place to be!</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Jennifer Price Davis, an artist, author &amp; illustrator of 5 children's books, and preschool teacher.  I live, work, and create in Cleveland, Ohio, with my husband, son, and our dog Coal.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I was having a rough day at lunchtime, when I noticed that I forgot to pack myself a cookie. I fessed up, to a class of very sympathetic 3-6 year old children, that I was not having a very good day at all. Genevieve (Genny) Serena Davis came to life that day and ""Not a very good day at all,"" became the title of my first book! </p>
<p>Five books later (six by the end of this year) I longed to create more stories that centered children with marginalized identities, where they weren't explaining their existence; rather, experiencing their everyday life. I want more children to see themselves reflected in literature and central to the story. Instead of me dreaming up what it *might* be like to live in  a body or life that is unfamiliar to me, I knew it was time to expand beyond my own books. I decided to create a publishing company and digital space called Happy and Free Kid's Space! The name signifies my intention to contribute to a society where children and all people can be happy and free - where it is safe to be as we are. (I wrote a theme song for that!)</p>
<p><strong>The future of Happy and Free Kid's Space</strong> is an online space that includes music, movement, and more!</p>
<ul>
<li>In  year 1, I plan to have the logo and website for Happy and Free, Kid's space developed, establish a social media presence promoting Genny books + one book I am illustrating for another author, the theme song recorded and incorporated into the website. Merchandise and consider a membership model to generate revenue (access to videos will always be free.)</li>
<li>Between year 1-2 Further develop online programming including reading books aloud, recording of additional songs and collaborative videos (where people are encouraged to record their family/community dancing and singing along.) Consider a podcast.</li>
<li>Proceeding years will include seeking out additional authors to publish and creating relevant  content.</li>
<li>Behind the scenes, I hope to create a Happy and Free organization that embodies what we are creating in every way: a supportive and inclusive space with fair wages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a sample of one of the songs I've written:</p>
<p> ""Confidence!""</p>

<div> </div>
<h2>Aesthetic</h2>
<p>Here's a sample of the aesthetic of Happy and Free Kid's space! This is painted by me and will be made into overalls. I have several other patterns, and this will mix with the aesthetic that various guests and community participants will bring. I envision beautiful layers of personality expressed through patterns and colors.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>By creating a digital space, the books read aloud and captioned, music, and information available will be accessible to more children. Additionally, with resources available to adults who care for children, I intend to support:</p>
<ul>
<li>positive and compassionate interactions </li>
<li>non-binary perspectives</li>
<li>fat-affirming, body-supportive spaces</li>
<li>inclusion of children of varying abilities, socio-economic status, etc.</li>
<li>making space for children who identify as LGBTQ+ or who have LGBTQ+ family members</li>
<li>reduction in occurrences of aging black and brown children up (seeing them as older than they are) and</li>
<li>disproportionately punishing these children. </li>
</ul>
<p>I realize my dream is big, and yet as an artist completing my own projects over the last 10+ years and with over 15 years working with children and young adults aged 18 months to college, always with a focus on social justice, I know that with your support, this dream will be a reality!</p>
<p>I deeply appreciate your contribution!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Debbie Chapnick and I am thrilled to be working on this wonderful project with Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki. The Shakesperian Tarot was originally published in 1993 and has been out of print since 1997.</p>
<p>For those of you that don't know Dolores, she has been the Directer of Studies of the Servants of the Light School of Occult Science for over 40 years. She has recently retired, but instead of relaxing and eating bon bons, she is writing every book and working on every project that she has ever had in her head! Dolores started out on the stage, so Shakespeare and his plays are very close to her heart. Now, with the help of social media this deck can get out into the world in a way that it couldn't before.</p>
<p>I have been working with Dolores since 1999 and have been her archivist since 2001. In addition to studying and reading tarot for over 20 years and I am the owner of Datura Press (<a href=""http://www.daturapress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.daturapress.com</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $5000 to get the deck, the boxes and the companion book printed. The new edition of the book will have an updated introduction by Dolores. There will be perks include decks and books, (paper or pdf) and will be available by the end of the year.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The deck and the book are designed, formatted and ready to go to the printer. As soon as the money is raised the decks will go to the printer. The more money we get, the more decks will be printed.</p>
<p>Why did we decide to do this now? At 90 Dolores wants to get certain projects don that have been in her head! Also I will send half the decks printed over to her in the UK so she can sell them at lectures and the local bookstores.</p>
</div><div><p>Regardless of the amount of money raised the deck will be printed.</p></div><div>

My name is Debbie Chapnick and I am thrilled to be working on this wonderful project with Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki. The Shakesperian Tarot was originally published in 1993 and has been out of print since 1997.
For those of you that don't know Dolores, she has been the Directer of Studies of the Servants of the Light School of Occult Science for over 40 years. She has recently retired, but instead of relaxing and eating bon bons, she is writing every book and working on every project that she has ever had in her head! Dolores started out on the stage, so Shakespeare and his plays are very close to her heart. Now, with the help of social media this deck can get out into the world in a way that it couldn't before.
I have been working with Dolores since 1999 and have been her archivist since 2001. In addition to studying and reading tarot for over 20 years and I am the owner of Datura Press (www.daturapress.com).
 

What We Need & What You Get
We need $5000 to get the deck, the boxes and the companion book printed. The new edition of the book will have an updated introduction by Dolores. There will be perks include decks and books, (paper or pdf) and will be available by the end of the year.

The Impact
The deck and the book are designed, formatted and ready to go to the printer. As soon as the money is raised the decks will go to the printer. The more money we get, the more decks will be printed.
Why did we decide to do this now? At 90 Dolores wants to get certain projects don that have been in her head! Also I will send half the decks printed over to her in the UK so she can sell them at lectures and the local bookstores.
Regardless of the amount of money raised the deck will be printed.

<h3>{The Mural}</h3>
<p>A mural this vast (spanning four walls) requires a lot of work to install, and we're still about $5,000 short. Funds raised will be used to purchase high quality materials, and to pay our amazing artist, Andrew Fearnside, for the hundreds of hours required to produce a mural of this scale. Now we need the community’s help to come up with the remaining funds so we can complete this community project!</p>
<p>With your help, the Birds of Burque Project will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a large-scale public art piece on Mountain Road (at Mountain and 12th)</li>
<li>Employ 1 lead artist and several assistant helpers</li>
<li>Add to the growing beautification around Albuquerque with murals</li>
<li>Create an area that encourages walking and exploring (this building is on the same corner as Cocina Azul, the NM Tea Company, and The Next Best Thing to Being There, and a block from Golden Crown Panaderia)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is a computer rendering of the mural plan:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>If you've been by my building lately, you've seen that Andrew has made some progress on the mural already. The walls have been prepped, painted the base dark blue and he's started on the layers of color - the background white flowers first. </p>

<p>I'm Vicki Bolen and I own Little Bird de Papel -  my art studio and shop in the picture above, <a href=""https://www.littlebirddepapel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Little Bird de Papel</a>, on Mountain Road. </p>

<p>I started my artist journey with my love of paper and used it to create paper quilts and other printed projects. I’ve since branched out into cranes and ceramics.</p>
<p>I make hand painted hanging cranes that are safe for outdoor use, art, gift cards, and more.  </p>
<p>I also love bringing people together to learn how to create ceramic bowls for my Soup is Love project. We create bowls, then they go on sale once a year and proceeds go to OffCenter Arts.</p>

He recently completed a mural at The Burger Stand on Central.</p>
<p>From Andrew: ""The Birds of Burque project will cover over 1000 square feet of wall space—four walls.

<h3>Who we are and what we do!</h3>
<p>We are three artists coming together to create <i>uatsh-tide-uatsh.</i></p>
<p>Katharina Kneip and Masako Kato will go by kayak from Münster (Westf) in Germany all the way to Copenhagen in Denmark. During these about 6 weeks of passing different channels and the baltic sea we will film constantly with two action cameras. Duoni Liu will compose afterwards a piece of music with the duration of time that we need to overcome these about 1000km of water. </p>
<p>We want to create an interdisciplinary work that needs the same time that we need to canoe. A two channel video installation with an unique piece of music will be shown in different public places. In this work we will pass all kind of borders, connect people and places, experience an adventure in the middle of civilization and in the end create a way of making time visible and experienceable for everybody passing by in their daily life.</p>
<p>In order to manage this work safely we need to master about 40 TB of data, get a seaworthy boat with fitting life jackets and of course a lot of calories... </p>
<p>  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where does all the money go?</h3>
<p>In many things we can improvise, borrow clothes and live low budged, but when it comes to safety we cannot make any compromise:</p>
<ul>
<li>To save all the videos during the trip and the music composition, work on it and then show it, we need many discs, micro-SD cards for the cameras, solar panels, media server, ....................</li>
<li>To make it safely to Copenhagen ourselves we need a proper kayak with fitting life jackets</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can imagine these equipment needs quite some budget. Thanks to different sponsors we got already waterproof bags, sleeping bags and tarp, but still we need at least 4000 € in order to start and come back safely.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why <i>uatsh-tide-uatsh</i>?</h3>
<p>Coming from three different backgrounds of cultures and art we felt it is important to leave the comfort zone in order to create something new and powerful. Duoni as a composer (<a href=""http://www.duoni-liu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.duoni-liu.com</a>), Masako working a lot in digital art and Katharina with different interactive, performative sculptures (<a href=""https://katharinakneip.com/works).%C2%A0With"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://katharinakneip.com/works).&amp;nbsp;With</a> <i>uatsh-tide-uatsh</i> we don't want just to take part in todays daily life, but be the daily life. We are mainly passing a highly populated and agricultural area of Europe- a tiny bit of the world, but still we don't know what will happen during these weeks on the water, being together in one boat and following the rhythm of nature on the one hand and technical difficulties like changing batteries and SD-cards on the other.</p>
<p>With <i>uatsh-tide-uatsh</i> we don't want to keep the distance to our audience that many art works inhere. All the struggle of planning, but also all the beautiful things happening on the way from the beginning to the end are part of it.</p>
<p>We are excited to exchange with people that are as well passionate about facing new challenges, crossing borders, even when they are not visible on first sight as well as film, music, kayak, river, endurance .......... lovers. </p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Since we know that a two channel 6 week long video installation might be difficult to watch at home, we will create a limited edition of a special home version that comes along with a booklet. For those who want to take part in the video directly- order an individual postcard that we will send you from the way or save a spot in the closing credits.</p>
<p>Even if you cannot support us financially, feel free to write us your thoughts, share the link, tell your friends and help that many others can take part. All our supporters will receive invitations to the exhibitions and public places where<i> uatsh-tide-uatsh</i> will be shown.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Blue Moon Camera &amp; Machine recently acquired the warehouse directly across from the James John Elementary School. We plan to change this currently desolate corner of St. Johns into a place of civic pride.</p>
<p>We’ve already planted curbside trees and installed dramatic night-time lighting to improve the space. The centerpiece of this transformation will be a massive 175 foot long panoramic mural by noted North Portland artist <a href=""https://davidcarmacklewis.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">David Carmack Lewis</a>.</p>
<p>But we can't make this happen without your help.</p>
<h3>Breve Resumen</h3>
<p>Blue Moon Camera &amp; Machine recientemente adquirió el almacén directamente frente a la Escuela Primaria James John. Planeamos cambiar este rincón actualmente desolado de St. Johns en un lugar de orgullo cívico.</p>
<p>Ya hemos plantado árboles en la acera e instalado una espectacular iluminación nocturna para mejorar el espacio. La pieza central de esta transformación será un mural panorámico masivo de 175 pies de largo del reconocido artista del norte de Portland, <a href=""http://davidcarmacklewis.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>David Carmack Lewis</u></a>.</p>
<p>Pero no podemos lograr que esto suceda sin su ayuda.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582736292/smqz6batzunlr6zpbtqr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Mr. Lewis has been given complete artistic control over the concept and design. As photographers, we appreciate that great art is created by artists, not by clients or committees.</p>
<p>Mr. Lewis' work was recently featured in a solo show at the Coos Art Museum. He is a Ford Family Foundation grant recipient for his exhibition on fire and fossil fuels. His work has been represented in galleries and juried shows throughout the American West. His Boise mural, ""The Big Back Yard"" was selected to represent Idaho in Parade Magazine's article ""<a href=""https://parade.com/899760/kristinluna/best-murals-street-art-every-state/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Murals Across America: The Very Best Street Art in Every</a><a href=""https://parade.com/899760/kristinluna/best-murals-street-art-every-state/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> State</a>"".<br/><br/>(See our FAQs to learn more about the artist's concept for this project.)</p>
<p>El señor Lewis ha recibido control artístico completo sobre el concepto y el diseño. Como fotógrafos, apreciamos que el gran arte sea creado por artistas, no por clientes o comités.</p>
<p>El trabajo del señor Lewis apareció recientemente en una exposición individual en el Museo de Arte Coos. Recibió una subvención de la Ford Family Foundation por su exposición sobre incendios y combustibles fósiles. Su trabajo ha sido representado en galerías y espectáculos con jurado en todo el oeste americano. Su mural de Boise, ""The Big Back Yard"" fue seleccionado para representar al estado de Idaho en el artículo de la revista Parade ""<a href=""http://parade.com/899760/kristinluna/best-murals-street-art-every-state/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Murales en toda América: el mejor arte callejero en cada estado</u></a>"".</p>
<p>(Consulte nuestras preguntas frecuentes para obtener más información sobre el concepto del artista para este proyecto).</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All funds will first be applied to the necessary expenses in the order in which they occur: Wall preparation, paints and supplies, lift rental, insurance and anti-graffiti coating.

We started this campaign just two weeks before the pandemic shut downs.  We are ready to relaunch soon. Thank you all for your support.
 
Short Summary
Blue Moon Camera & Machine recently acquired the warehouse directly across from the James John Elementary School. We plan to change this currently desolate corner of St. Johns into a place of civic pride.
We’ve already planted curbside trees and installed dramatic night-time lighting to improve the space. The centerpiece of this transformation will be a massive 175 foot long panoramic mural by noted North Portland artist David Carmack Lewis.
But we can't make this happen without your help.
Breve Resumen
Blue Moon Camera & Machine recientemente adquirió el almacén directamente frente a la Escuela Primaria James John. Planeamos cambiar este rincón actualmente desolado de St. Johns en un lugar de orgullo cívico.
Ya hemos plantado árboles en la acera e instalado una espectacular iluminación nocturna para mejorar el espacio. La pieza central de esta transformación será un mural panorámico masivo de 175 pies de largo del reconocido artista del norte de Portland, David Carmack Lewis.
Pero no podemos lograr que esto suceda sin su ayuda.

Mr. Lewis has been given complete artistic control over the concept and design. As photographers, we appreciate that great art is created by artists, not by clients or committees.
Mr. Lewis' work was recently featured in a solo show at the Coos Art Museum. He is a Ford Family Foundation grant recipient for his exhibition on fire and fossil fuels. His work has been represented in galleries and juried shows throughout the American West. His Boise mural, ""The Big Back Yard"" was selected to represent Idaho in Parade Magazine's article ""Murals Across America: The Very Best Street Art in Every State"".(See our FAQs to learn more about the artist's concept for this project.)
El señor Lewis ha recibido control artístico completo sobre el concepto y el diseño. Como fotógrafos, apreciamos que el gran arte sea creado por artistas, no por clientes o comités.
El trabajo del señor Lewis apareció recientemente en una exposición individual en el Museo de Arte Coos. Recibió una subvención de la Ford Family Foundation por su exposición sobre incendios y combustibles fósiles. Su trabajo ha sido representado en galerías y espectáculos con jurado en todo el oeste americano. Su mural de Boise, ""The Big Back Yard"" fue seleccionado para representar al estado de Idaho en el artículo de la revista Parade ""Murales en toda América: el mejor arte callejero en cada estado"".
(Consulte nuestras preguntas frecuentes para obtener más información sobre el concepto del artista para este proyecto).
 

What We Need & What You Get
All funds will first be applied to the necessary expenses in the order in which they occur: Wall preparation, paints and supplies, lift rental, insurance and anti-graffiti coating. The artist will contribute most of his usual fee as an in-kind donation. Additional funds raised will help to partially compensate him for his time. He will be spending nearly every day for two months on a truly monumental piece of public art that will become an iconic part of the historic downtown St. Johns business district.
As a thank you for your donation, we are offering a variety of perks, including fine art prints and some schwag from Blue Moon Camera & Machine. We'll be adding additional perks in the days and weeks to come.

For a donation of $40 we'll send you a Blue Moon Camera coffee mug and pin.
For a donation of $75, we offer one of three different fine art prints representing elements from the mural.  
For a donation of $150, we are offering a panoramic print of the initial concept design.
For a donation of $250, we offer a limited edition signed print, hand-selected from David’s extensive personal catalogue. 

All of these fine art  prints will be produced by technicians at Blue Moon Camera, America’s hardest-working photo lab.

<h3>Public art installation in Owl's head park,</h3>
<h3>Bay Ridge, Brooklyn</h3>
<ul>
<li>I initiated this project with students of Fort Hamilton High School who visited  Heraklio, Greece and did a workshop with the European School students.</li>
<li>in 2017 I had the chance to further work for the preparation of this project through workshops I made in MERVO, Mergenthaler Vocational-Technical High School students and their amazing art teacher Sia Kyriakakos in Baltimore.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The project is an official collaboration with the Parks Department of NYC but there is, unfortunately, no available funding for the installation and insurance expenses.</li>
<li>In the past I solely funded my project with them in Tompkins Square Park in the East Village, but things have changed and this project has much higher expenses, notably in <u>liability insurance</u> and by the nature of the project, since the sculptures are bigger and need to be transported and I need more <u>materials and equipment</u> to install them in the park.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529250240/d57jth2mnxabqy3y3ger.png"" src=""""/>
</li>
<li>I feel very committed to the neighborhood and all the kids that worked on this project. I hope that most of the visitors of the park will be agreeably surprised since this would be the very first art installation ever in this park!</li>
<li>Your generous contributions will ensure that all the children's efforts on this project will become a reality!</li>

</div></div>","Public art installation in Owl's head park,
Bay Ridge, Brooklyn

I initiated this project with students of Fort Hamilton High School who visited  Heraklio, Greece and did a workshop with the European School students.
in 2017 I had the chance to further work for the preparation of this project through workshops I made in MERVO, Mergenthaler Vocational-Technical High School students and their amazing art teacher Sia Kyriakakos in Baltimore.




The project is an official collaboration with the Parks Department of NYC but there is, unfortunately, no available funding for the installation and insurance expenses.
In the past I solely funded my project with them in Tompkins Square Park in the East Village, but things have changed and this project has much higher expenses, notably in liability insurance and by the nature of the project, since the sculptures are bigger and need to be transported and I need more materials and equipment to install them in the park.

I feel very committed to the neighborhood and all the kids that worked on this project. I hope that most of the visitors of the park will be agreeably surprised since this would be the very first art installation ever in this park!
Your generous contributions will ensure that all the children's efforts on this project will become a reality!

What we need and what you are funding

 $ 3,500 are needed to co-fund this project.
All my fees and work time has been funded by me! 
 This amount covers the liability insurance, transportation of the sculptures, the installation materials and the technician who will help on that day to make sure we the installation makes it through next winter without any incidents!
The first  expense is the liability insurance without which we cannot even sign the contract. If we do not raise all the funds we will still cover this and continue with what we have for the installation.

<h3>WELCOME TO FREE BELARUS! </h3>
<p>Команда Freedom Belarus создаёт первый виртуальный музей, предоставляющий безопасную  площадку для творческих людей Беларуси.</p>
<p>В 2020 году весь мир узнал о маленькой, но гордой стране – Беларусь. Здесь живет чуть больше 9 млн человек с потрясающим чувством юмора, энергией, безграничным креативом и силой. За несколько месяцев жизнь этих людей изменилась до неузнаваемости. Но несмотря на все сложности, они продолжают творить и экспериментировать, раскрывая все грани творчества.</p>

<p>К сожалению, неразумная цензура, бесконечные запреты и немыслимые ограничения не дают художникам, скульпторам, дизайнерам, фотографам и режиссерам воплощать ироничные идеи, отражающие беларускую действительность. Искусство по-беларуски – это искусство не в Беларуси.</p>
<p>Наш проект решит это проблему окончательно. Виртуальный музей станет полностью защищенной творческой средой для каждого креативного беларуса. Картины, плакаты, муралы, песни, видео, скульптуры, стихи, фотографии – все виды искусства найдут место в наших экспозициях.</p>
<p>Пространство музея будет разделено на несколько тематических залов, отражающих определенную проблематику. В первом – мы продемонстрируем всю суть противостояния последних месяцев, представив несколько сотен эксклюзивных работ. Более 20 художников и предоставили свои эксклюзивные эскизы и материалы для создания первого беларуского виртуального музея.</p>

<p>While the whole world is confronting the Coronavirus pandemic, attention given to the Hong Kong movement has rapidly decreased. In fact, the authoritarian leadership in China is the main source of this global crisis, and the state of our world is in now further underscores the need to stand with Hong Kong and the values they are fighting for. We are a group of New Yorkers, bringing the voices and significant artworks from the Hong Kong movement to New York City.<br/> </p>
<p>當全世界在面對武漢肺炎這場疫症時，連帶對香港的抗爭運動的關注也急速下降。現時全球開始察覺到中共政權黑暗、狡詐及腐敗，這正是武漢肺炎散播全球的主要原因，香港人應把握這次機會讓全球與我們站在同一陣線。藉此展覽，我們將繼續盡居於海外的香港人的責任，使以香港抗爭為主題的展覽及連儂牆上的作品首次登上紐約的舞台，傳揚香港人的聲音。</p>

<p>With our exhibition designers, we are presenting interactive displays, photographic &amp; video documentations of ways in which citizens react and respond in times of urgency— of testimonials, creative performances, and other disobedient civic actions taken to the streets. </p>
<p>Street art and graphic design are defining features of the pro-democracy demonstrations. Not only do they visually convey the stories and emotions of the people, its collective mode of production reflects the unique culture and identity of Hong Kong. Our exhibition aims to celebrate and exemplify the decentralized, democratic nature of the movement, by presenting the crowd sourced and open sourced artworks and posters that are shared online and disseminated on Lennon walls across the city. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>香港的街頭充滿各人的吶喊，成為了意識形態的戰場，並讓人深切感受香港人的毅力。我們將藉互動式作品、照片、影象等表現香港人以文字、富有創意的方式及各種公民行動去極速應對暴政的打壓及社會的反應。</p>
<p>這場民主抗爭運動的其中一個特徵是街頭藝術及各種設計。這些作品除了向觀眾細說不同故事及情感，其集體創作的特色更反映出獨特的香港文化及人文特質。為此，我們選擇展出於網上及連儂場遍地開花、百花齊放的藝術品及文宣，以突出這場運動去中心化及重視民主的特色，並由選出的作品去體現香港人所重視的普世價值。</p>
<p><br/>As part of the exhibit, we are looking to collaborate with oversea non-Hong Kong groups such as Taiwanese, Tibetan, East Turkestan groups for the launch event, talks, and panel discussions, to be live-streamed. To allow audiences outside of NYC to engage in our show, we are collecting Lennon Wall messages to be displayed in our exhibit.

<p>作為藝術展覽中的一部分，我們計劃邀請來自台灣丶西藏及東突厥斯坦的嘉賓，參與開幕及座談會等活動。為使紐約以外的人參與這個展覽，現場將會提供直播。而特別在香港難以建立長久的連儂牆的時刻，我們希望收集大家的心聲共同建築展覽內屬於大家的連儂牆。更多詳情將會稍後公佈，請密切留意我們<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/nycsingswithyouhk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>上的最新動向。<br/> </p>

<i>The symbolism of the turtle is important to me as a Polynesian because of the layers of multiple meanings the icon conveys. I incorporate the Honu into my art with my paintings and my sculptures.

Art is one of humanity’s most beautiful expressions that inspire people to do great
things. The <i>Cook Islands Honu Monument</i> is not just about sea turtles. It’s not just
about humans. It’s about a global inter-species movement—the celebration of a
way of life that flourished with all of nature.<p><br/>Pacific
Islanders have lived with sea turtles for thousands of years. Polynesian
peoples and wildlife have lived together with mutual regard and respect. The
<i>Honu</i> (green sea turtle) symbolizes this ancient pact, a pact that has <i>not </i>been honored by modern
humanity.</p><p>Sea turtles
are teetering on the edge of extinction. Unless this is stopped, they will
follow the dodo and albatross and the ever-growing list of animals who are
disappearing because of modern human pollution and waste. Our own species is in
danger; not only our physical survival, but
the survival of our souls. But we can turn this around. The monument is one
giant step towards a new future. It represents humanity’s commitment to renewed
peace and well-being for all animals and the tribal peoples who have kept
wildlife cultures free and thriving.<br/><br/></p><h2><b>Our Gift to the Future </b></h2>

In conjunction with <a href=""http://www.kerulos.org/our-projects/sacred-bones/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Kerulos Center's Sacred Bones Project</a>, the monument will serve as a
 pivot for education and advocacy among local and international 
communities to inspire conservation and cultural revitalization. This project integrates art into a conservation education and outreach program conducted by <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/individuals/10817619"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Michael White</a>. <br/><br/>Dr. White's conservation education includes classroom and field activities to study  biodiversity, sustainability, and environmental balance to ensure healthy ecosystems for future generations. Senior students assist in various phases of research, including surveys of critical
green sea turtle nesting beaches on remote cays, inventories of nests after hatching, genetic sampling, and tagging. Classroom resources include designing and printing educational resources in local languages.<br/><h2><br/></h2><h2>Our Story<br/>
</h2><p>It all started with <i>Honu</i>—the green sea turtle. </p>
<p>One day, while developing curricula for our <a href=""http://www.kerulos.org/our-projects/sacred-bones/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sacred Bones Project</a>, we came upon the idea of <i><a href=""http://www.kerulos.org/our-projects/sacred-bones/wildlife-monuments/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wildlife Monuments</a></i>. Sacred Bones is a <i>learning-in-service </i>program that
combines science, history, and tribal culture with practical hands-on work to
aid endangered wildlife and foster <i>nature-based consciousness</i> (see video below).<br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe align=""middle"" class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FAGX8fJyDisw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAGX8fJyDisw&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FAGX8fJyDisw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>Companion sculptures designed by tribal artists seemed
the perfect way to expand our mission to support wildlife and tribal
self-determination worldwide. Monuments are usually for humans, and also many
are created in memory of those who have died. But we wanted to have something
that celebrated <i>the living—s</i>ea turtles who are struggling to survive. </p>

over 200 million years. But, because of modern humans, they have been pushed to
the edge of extinction. <br/><br/>The cultures of tribal humans who have lived side by side with the turtles for thousands of years are also endangered. Creating the <i>Honu</i> monument and its unveiling on the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/cookislands2015"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">50th anniversary of the Cook Islands' Independence</a> celebrates the ancient pact between Pacific Islanders and
their marine kin.<br/><br/><p>Like the sea turtle, our team spans the globe. The sea turtle is therefore a symbol of human unity and cooperation. By linking art
with education and science, the <i>Honu </i>represents active engagement to inspire
modern human cultural change and return to peaceful and respectful ways of
living.</p><h4>The Sacred Bones Vision<br/>
</h4>
<p>The <i>Cook Islands Honu Monument </i>is the first of seven
planned sculptures in the <a href=""http://www.kerulos.org/our-projects/sacred-bones/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sacred Bones Project</a> that will be designed and created around the world by tribal
artists—one for each endangered sea turtle species. The seven monuments will crystallize artistic, cultural, and scientific communication and exchange among sea turtle <i>peoples</i>, tribal cultures with deep traditional knowledge of living sustainably in ocean ecosystems. <br/><br/></p><h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2><p>

Monument to an Ancient CultureMaori master artists, Ian George and Henry Tavioni, are creating a metal and stone sculpture of Honu, the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) to be unveiled during the Cook Islands' 50th Anniversary Independence Day celebrations, August 4, 2015. It will stand in front of the
Cook Islands Ministry of Education and UNESCO building where national and
international students, religious leaders, officials, and the public visit
daily.

The Cook Islands Honu Monument is a testimony of dignity and compassion that 
celebrates tribal and wildlife societies who have lived side-by-side for 
thousands of years. 


How Can Art Save an Endangered Species? 







The symbolism of the turtle is important to me as a Polynesian because of the layers of multiple meanings the icon conveys. I incorporate the Honu into my art with my paintings and my sculptures. It is also an image I wear inked onto my body again because of its significance within the Pacific indigenous communities. – Ian George



 
 

Art is one of humanity’s most beautiful expressions that inspire people to do great
things. The Cook Islands Honu Monument is not just about sea turtles. It’s not just
about humans. It’s about a global inter-species movement—the celebration of a
way of life that flourished with all of nature.Pacific
Islanders have lived with sea turtles for thousands of years. Polynesian
peoples and wildlife have lived together with mutual regard and respect. The
Honu (green sea turtle) symbolizes this ancient pact, a pact that has not been honored by modern
humanity.Sea turtles
are teetering on the edge of extinction. Unless this is stopped, they will
follow the dodo and albatross and the ever-growing list of animals who are
disappearing because of modern human pollution and waste. Our own species is in
danger; not only our physical survival, but
the survival of our souls. But we can turn this around. The monument is one
giant step towards a new future. It represents humanity’s commitment to renewed
peace and well-being for all animals and the tribal peoples who have kept
wildlife cultures free and thriving.Our Gift to the Future 







Young ones learning to tally hatched eggs.



 









In conjunction with The Kerulos Center's Sacred Bones Project, the monument will serve as a
 pivot for education and advocacy among local and international 
communities to inspire conservation and cultural revitalization. This project integrates art into a conservation education and outreach program conducted by Dr. Michael White. Dr. White's conservation education includes classroom and field activities to study  biodiversity, sustainability, and environmental balance to ensure healthy ecosystems for future generations. Senior students assist in various phases of research, including surveys of critical
green sea turtle nesting beaches on remote cays, inventories of nests after hatching, genetic sampling, and tagging. Classroom resources include designing and printing educational resources in local languages.Our Story
It all started with Honu—the green sea turtle. 
One day, while developing curricula for our Sacred Bones Project, we came upon the idea of Wildlife Monuments. Sacred Bones is a learning-in-service program that
combines science, history, and tribal culture with practical hands-on work to
aid endangered wildlife and foster nature-based consciousness (see video below).Companion sculptures designed by tribal artists seemed
the perfect way to expand our mission to support wildlife and tribal
self-determination worldwide. Monuments are usually for humans, and also many
are created in memory of those who have died. But we wanted to have something
that celebrated the living—sea turtles who are struggling to survive. 
Sea turtles have lived on earth since the dinosaurs—for
over 200 million years. But, because of modern humans, they have been pushed to
the edge of extinction. The cultures of tribal humans who have lived side by side with the turtles for thousands of years are also endangered. Creating the Honu monument and its unveiling on the 50th anniversary of the Cook Islands' Independence celebrates the ancient pact between Pacific Islanders and
their marine kin.Like the sea turtle, our team spans the globe. The sea turtle is therefore a symbol of human unity and cooperation. By linking art
with education and science, the Honu represents active engagement to inspire
modern human cultural change and return to peaceful and respectful ways of
living.The Sacred Bones Vision

The Cook Islands Honu Monument is the first of seven
planned sculptures in the Sacred Bones Project that will be designed and created around the world by tribal
artists—one for each endangered sea turtle species. The seven monuments will crystallize artistic, cultural, and scientific communication and exchange among sea turtle peoples, tribal cultures with deep traditional knowledge of living sustainably in ocean ecosystems.

</h3><h3>I usually come to Sheffield once a year for the renowned Sheffdocfest. Last year I discovered that Heavy Plant, my favourite Sheffield public sculpture, was facing imminent destruction. I had 6 weeks to save it from the bulldozer. I set up a campaign and with help from lots of people and Tesco we managed to get it professionally dismantled onto a giant special truck. It's now being safely stored at Kelham Island Industrial Museum. </h3><h3><br/></h3><h3>This year, I'd like your help to give something back to Sheffield and get this fabulous, iconic and maverick sculpture reconstructed and re-sited.</h3><div><br/></div><h3>If everyone at the docfest gave A fiver we'd have enough to do it! </h3><div><br/></div><h3>Please donate - it's time to re-pot Heavy Plant!</h3><h3>Heavy Plant is special because it was one of the very first art commissions in the newly named Industrial Quarter. It is a powerful sculpture connecting Sheffield's proud steel heritage to today's cultural renaissance. It celebrates the unsung heroes; the people that actually worked in the little mesters yards and independent cutlers of Sheffield.</h3><h3><br/></h3><h3>Built by sculptor David Kemp in 1988, Heavy Plant takes the form of an imaginary furnace with a bizarre spray of materials - including shards of glass and toolmakers offcuts - erupting dramatically from the top. </h3><h3>The sculpture stands eighteen feet high and is built from recycled debris that Kemp found on Sheffield’s derelict industrial sites. He used material from local toolmakers and cutlers, old factory windows and even bits of defunct machinery. </h3><h3><br/></h3><h3>The sculpture celebrates Sheffield’s past as the City of Steel and reflects the fact that after the demise of so many of its old industrial buildings, a new and vibrant city of culture has emerged.</h3><h3><br/></h3><h3>A new development is being built over the old site by BMB Property developers for Hallam University, to build new luxury student accommodation Pearl Works.</h3><h3><br/></h3><h3>Sara Hill set up the campaign:</h3><h3><br/></h3><h3>“I have long been a fan of Heavy Plant and was very sad to witness its dilapidation and hear of its possible demise,” she said earlier this week. “For the past 18 years I have been coming to Sheffield for the annual Sheffield documentary festival. Every year I would visit the sculpture, take photos and introduce others to it. I love its wit and charm. The fact that it is made of heavy old steel plant materials, made by the hard working men and women of the industrial era, yet it looks like a plant and the top thistle even blows in the wind like long grass. I started this campaign to save and relocate this important work.</h3><h3>The original artist David Kemp is not in good health and now lives in west Cornwall. I've since had the pleasure of visiting David in his studio and it's been a privilege to get to know him and see more of his works. He has given his blessing and support to two local artists to repair Heavy Plant and re-imagine it - perhaps as part of a new work to reflect a new location in the area.

I usually come to Sheffield once a year for the renowned Sheffdocfest. Last year I discovered that Heavy Plant, my favourite Sheffield public sculpture, was facing imminent destruction. I had 6 weeks to save it from the bulldozer. I set up a campaign and with help from lots of people and Tesco we managed to get it professionally dismantled onto a giant special truck. It's now being safely stored at Kelham Island Industrial Museum. This year, I'd like your help to give something back to Sheffield and get this fabulous, iconic and maverick sculpture reconstructed and re-sited.If everyone at the docfest gave A fiver we'd have enough to do it! Please donate - it's time to re-pot Heavy Plant!Heavy Plant is special because it was one of the very first art commissions in the newly named Industrial Quarter. It is a powerful sculpture connecting Sheffield's proud steel heritage to today's cultural renaissance. It celebrates the unsung heroes; the people that actually worked in the little mesters yards and independent cutlers of Sheffield.Built by sculptor David Kemp in 1988, Heavy Plant takes the form of an imaginary furnace with a bizarre spray of materials - including shards of glass and toolmakers offcuts - erupting dramatically from the top. The sculpture stands eighteen feet high and is built from recycled debris that Kemp found on Sheffield’s derelict industrial sites. He used material from local toolmakers and cutlers, old factory windows and even bits of defunct machinery. The sculpture celebrates Sheffield’s past as the City of Steel and reflects the fact that after the demise of so many of its old industrial buildings, a new and vibrant city of culture has emerged.A new development is being built over the old site by BMB Property developers for Hallam University, to build new luxury student accommodation Pearl Works.Sara Hill set up the campaign:“I have long been a fan of Heavy Plant and was very sad to witness its dilapidation and hear of its possible demise,” she said earlier this week. “For the past 18 years I have been coming to Sheffield for the annual Sheffield documentary festival. Every year I would visit the sculpture, take photos and introduce others to it. I love its wit and charm. The fact that it is made of heavy old steel plant materials, made by the hard working men and women of the industrial era, yet it looks like a plant and the top thistle even blows in the wind like long grass. I started this campaign to save and relocate this important work.The original artist David Kemp is not in good health and now lives in west Cornwall. I've since had the pleasure of visiting David in his studio and it's been a privilege to get to know him and see more of his works. He has given his blessing and support to two local artists to repair Heavy Plant and re-imagine it - perhaps as part of a new work to reflect a new location in the area. Jason Heppenstall, like David, makes beautiful sculptures out of scrap metal and Andrew Vickers is a sculptor and stonemason.” Darren Bown, conservation engineer at SIMT and maker, will be assisting them. Some of David's other work includes the Navigators at Hayes Galleria. http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-navigators and the much loved Well Heeled Bitches http://www.davidkemp.uk.com/tinners-hounds/Thanks to Jaqui Bellamy and Eve Wood we've also been filming the campaign and hope to turn it into a short film. David Kemp still has some of his original sketches and watercolours so we plan to mount an exhibition when it's all done.If you'd like to hear the full story and see more photos and videos, take a look on Facebook for now, there will be a blog and Instagram coming soonFor more information and contacts:Sara Hillsaveheavyplant@gmail.com@saveheavyplant

<p>Indonesia biggest and free Street Art and Graffiti Festival NEED YOUR HELP to make it Incredible again !</p>
<p>We are a group of Street Art Enthusiasts,  coming from both local and expat communities in Bali and we have been working hard since 2015 to support the local Street art and graffiti communities to help the talented Balinese and Indonesian artists to be able to make a living from their work. We are also supporting different projects related to waste management or wildlife protection in Bali to protect this beautiful Island for the next generations to enjoy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This campaign should help us to close the budget for our second edition of the TROPICA Festival. This event is a unique opportunity for the young and talented communities of Bali Street Art and Graffiti artists to connect with more experienced artists from all over the world.</p>
<p>All of us are working for FREE on these projects, and all our events are FREE for everyone to attend. We do manage to get a few sponsors every year to cover some of the costs related to the organization of the Festival, but we rely mostly on the generosity of private contributors to make it happen and to have a major impact for the local communities in Bali.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our total budget for 2017 is 40’000$ and we have barely covered half of it with Sponsors this year, so your contribution is KEY to help us make it happen.</p>
<p>The money will be used to cover mostly the logistic, material, promotion costs and legal fees associated with the event.</p>
<p>If you can’t support us financially but you still want to help and you will be in Bali during festival dates, please get in touch with us to become part of our volunteer team</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Erin Bassett is an artist based in Fort Lauderdale, FL. Her artistic journey began with painting lessons in her grandmother’s garage at the age of 5, the gift of a camera at the age of 18 and the discovery of fabric at 28. She now has her own company, Erin Bassett Artistry, which aims to create unique, sophisticated, one-of-a-kind textiles and fabric sculptures for the home and body. Her inspiration comes from her fascination with the characteristics of silk and the beautiful seascapes of the local Florida reefs. Erin designs, sculpts, and creates artistic wall art and wearable silk accessories. She has been an exhibiting artist since 2002 after graduating from the University of Florida with a BFA in Creative Photography and continued through her studies at the Savannah College of Art + Design, where she received her MFA in Textile Design in 2012.  Her work was discovered this year by a scout and now she is on her way to exhibit at Spectrum Miami during Art Basel! </p>
<p>This campaign is raising money to get Erin to Spectrum during Art Basel. Art Basel is an international art fair with three shows staged annually in Basel, Switzerland; Miami Beach, Florida; and Hong Kong. Each show is organized into sectors which showcase contemporary artworks by established and newly emerging artists. Over 250 of the world’s leading galleries participate drawing over 70,000 visitors each year, offering an exciting and inspiring week for artists, collectors, curators, critics and art enthusiasts.</p>
<p>This is the opportunity to make a career out of passion and talent. Art Basel is where dreams become reality. Becoming an artist has been a life long dream… but it is not a cheap dream. In order to create large and impactful work that will make an impression on galleries, journalists and collectors, Erin must first purchase the supplies to create the work, take 5 months to make it, and coordinate the logistics to create the best exhibit possible. Raising money will allow Erin can concentrate on the work itself to make the best impression on the art industry as possible as a jump start to her career.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Breakdown</h3>
<ul>
<li>Supplies to make the work: Fabric (and lots of it), canvases, dyes, stiffener, objects, rubber bands, rubber gloves, needles, thread, etc etc etc...</li>
<li>Show materials: Professional photographs of each piece, printed catalog, business cards and vinyl display for the wall.</li>
<li>Transportation and logistics: hotel, trailer, custom boxes for each piece (extra large cardboard boxes are crazy expensive!), gas. </li>
</ul>
<p>Since I have never done a show on this grand a scale, I need to update not only the work itself but the way I display the work and the packaging for the clients who purchase it!</p>
<h3>Perks:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spectrum/Red Dot tickets to the Show!</li>
<li>Signed postcard artwork</li>
<li>Lapel pin</li>
<li>Necklace</li>
<li>Signed catalog from the show</li>
<li>2 hour Dinner with the Artist</li>
<li>4 hour Workshop with the artist</li>
</ul>
<p>Any funds donated will go towards the cost of making the artwork that will be displayed at Spectrum. Even if the entire goal is not met, any and all donations will get the artist closer to success.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Art Basel is an international art fair. Boasting over 160 exhibitors from all over the world, Spectrum showcases thousands of cutting-edge works of art in its sleek, gallery-style venue in Miami’s Arts and Entertainment District. Last year’s VIP Opening Night Party drew a crowd of 5,800 to take part in exciting unveilings, refreshments, and a first glimpse at all of the artwork. Throughout the weekend, throngs of visitors enjoy Meet the Artist events, live demos, inspiring Art Labs, and the palpable Miami Art Week buzz in the air.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, my work has awed and impressed most spectators. Every time the work has been on display I get comments like “you should show this at Art Basel” or “This work needs to be seen by more people”. Well, this is my chance to show it to the art world on a grand scale. By Exhibiting during Art Basel, I will get exposure to galleries, collectors and journalists. This is the kind of event that can turn childhood dreams into a lifelong, sustainable career. </p>
<p>There is never just “one” shot. If you fail, you simply try again but his opportunity is a big one for me. If Spectrum in December is successful, there is an opportunity to show at ArtExpo in New York in April, building on the momentum gained at Spectrum. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>One of the hardest parts about becoming an artist is getting the opportunity to present your work to the key players: gallerists, collectors and journalists. These are the people that tell the world which artists to pay attention to. After a 20 year struggle, Erin has worked incredibly hard to overcome the obstacles associated with a career in art. Spectrum provides the opportunity to get her artwork in front of the art world on a national and international level.</p>
<p>In order to make an impact on the key players that will be walking the halls of Spectrum, Erin must create dynamic, large, and intricate works. This will take money to buy supplies, the time and skill it takes to create the work as well as a beautifully clean, crisp display inside the booth. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I hope that you consider making a contribution. Every dollar counts in the journey to Spectrum. If you cannot contribute monetarily at this time, please consider sharing this campaign with your friends and family. Thank you in advance from the bottom of my heart!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Unsolicited Sideshow is a pop-up exhibition and event series that explores how the contemporary condition of ‘otherness’ informs architectural expression. It opens at the Chicago Athletic Association (CAA) as a corollary exhibit to the 2017 Chicago Architecture Biennial’s main stage at the Chicago Cultural Center. Like the parallel tents of entertainment that congregate around a traveling circus, The Sideshow positions a cast of architectural 'freaks' and 'weirdos' to amplify the energy and visitorship of the main attraction, and give voice to a younger generation of thinkers and practitioners. Drawing on its history of nomadic entertainment, the pop-up content will activate the lobby and mezzanine of the CAA, displayed on a collection of custom sandwich boards (Sideshow Boards) designed as abstracted sideshow characters.</p>
<p>Alongside the exhibition, the Sideshow will culminate in four Friday night events, called Tank Takeovers. The “Tank"" is a large exhibition hall inside the CAA. These one-night happenings will activate the Tank’s double-height space, highlight select contributors from the pop-up content in the lobby, and explore thematic cues that engage ideas of ‘otherness.’ Tank Takeovers will initiate dialogue between the Sideshow and the Biennial and the Chicago community through performance, installation, panel discussions, and multi-media presentations.</p>
<p>The exhibition and Tank Takeovers will engage the contemporary discourse of architecture, as well as contemporary culture and politics by asking contributors to explore ideas of 'otherness,' abnormality, and taboo. In the current political and cultural moment, hard lines are being drawn to define and reward ideas of normalcy by spotlighting and punishing an expanding profile of 'others.' Just as the circus sideshow challenged the bounds of normalcy, The Sideshow will explore the contemporary condition of 'otherness' as it informs architectural expression through form, program, material, and affect.</p>
<p>The Unsolicited Sideshow at the Chicago Architecture Biennial is curated and produced by <a href=""http://www.couldbearchitecture.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Could Be Architecture</a> (Joseph Altshuler &amp; Zack Morrison), curator and critic Chelsea Ross, and designer Matthew Harlan. We will present architectural pleasures, oddities, and delights from a troupe of young and emerging designers and practices.</p>
<p>The contributors hail from far and wide, with an emphasis on Chicago and Midwest. Contributors include <strong>Adrianne Joergensen</strong> (Singapore), <strong>Architecture Hero</strong> (Chicago), <strong>Chicago Underground Practice</strong> (Chicago), <strong>Cosmo Design Factory</strong> (Philmont, NY), <strong>Could Be Architecture</strong> (Chicago), <strong>John Clark &amp; Taylor Holloway</strong> (Chicago), <strong>Office Andorus</strong> (Portland), <strong>office ca</strong> (Columbus, OH), <strong>S. Surface</strong> (Seattle), <strong>Skylar Moran</strong> (Chicago), <strong>SUBSTUDIO</strong> (Detroit and Cincinnati), and <strong>Team B Architecture &amp; Design</strong> (Cincinnati).</p>
<p>Serious frivolity and terrifying joy await you at the Sideshow!</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>As an independent endeavor and a labor of love, we need your support to fund the exhibit design, production, and programming.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
The Unsolicited Sideshow is a pop-up exhibition and event series that explores how the contemporary condition of ‘otherness’ informs architectural expression. It opens at the Chicago Athletic Association (CAA) as a corollary exhibit to the 2017 Chicago Architecture Biennial’s main stage at the Chicago Cultural Center. Like the parallel tents of entertainment that congregate around a traveling circus, The Sideshow positions a cast of architectural 'freaks' and 'weirdos' to amplify the energy and visitorship of the main attraction, and give voice to a younger generation of thinkers and practitioners. Drawing on its history of nomadic entertainment, the pop-up content will activate the lobby and mezzanine of the CAA, displayed on a collection of custom sandwich boards (Sideshow Boards) designed as abstracted sideshow characters.
Alongside the exhibition, the Sideshow will culminate in four Friday night events, called Tank Takeovers. The “Tank"" is a large exhibition hall inside the CAA. These one-night happenings will activate the Tank’s double-height space, highlight select contributors from the pop-up content in the lobby, and explore thematic cues that engage ideas of ‘otherness.’ Tank Takeovers will initiate dialogue between the Sideshow and the Biennial and the Chicago community through performance, installation, panel discussions, and multi-media presentations.
The exhibition and Tank Takeovers will engage the contemporary discourse of architecture, as well as contemporary culture and politics by asking contributors to explore ideas of 'otherness,' abnormality, and taboo. In the current political and cultural moment, hard lines are being drawn to define and reward ideas of normalcy by spotlighting and punishing an expanding profile of 'others.' Just as the circus sideshow challenged the bounds of normalcy, The Sideshow will explore the contemporary condition of 'otherness' as it informs architectural expression through form, program, material, and affect.
The Unsolicited Sideshow at the Chicago Architecture Biennial is curated and produced by Could Be Architecture (Joseph Altshuler & Zack Morrison), curator and critic Chelsea Ross, and designer Matthew Harlan. We will present architectural pleasures, oddities, and delights from a troupe of young and emerging designers and practices.
The contributors hail from far and wide, with an emphasis on Chicago and Midwest. Contributors include Adrianne Joergensen (Singapore), Architecture Hero (Chicago), Chicago Underground Practice (Chicago), Cosmo Design Factory (Philmont, NY), Could Be Architecture (Chicago), John Clark & Taylor Holloway (Chicago), Office Andorus (Portland), office ca (Columbus, OH), S. Surface (Seattle), Skylar Moran (Chicago), SUBSTUDIO (Detroit and Cincinnati), and Team B Architecture & Design (Cincinnati).
Serious frivolity and terrifying joy await you at the Sideshow!
What We Need
As an independent endeavor and a labor of love, we need your support to fund the exhibit design, production, and programming.
Every dollar matters. While the first priority of our campaign is to fund the design and fabrication of the Sideshow Boards themselves, reaching our full fundraising goal will allow us to augment the scope of the monthly Friday night events, print an exhibition catalogue that will elaborate on each contributor’s work, and support the contributors’ time with artist honoraria.
Help us exhibit architectural ‘otherness’ to a broad public and offer free architectural and cultural programming in an informal and approachable setting in downtown Chicago!
Your support will help fund the following:$3000 for Exhibition Supplies (wood, paint, tools etc...) $2500 for Tank Takeovers (performers, bartenders, production, and marketing)$2000 for Exhibition Catalogue (design and printing)$2500 for Contributor Honoraria  

The Impact
Chicago is a city celebrated for its bold architecture, yet many of its denizens lack accessible and entertaining opportunities to engage with the city’s architectural legacy and future. The Unsolicited Sideshow provides a “ticket” to an architectural show that invites a broad public into an expansive world of Chicago-infused architectural ideas.
In addition, we believe that quasi-public spaces should be activated with engaging content for everyone to enjoy. Many hotel and office lobbies in the loop are open to public passersby, and we see these spaces as fertile territory to organize intentional, educational, and entertaining content for the public. The Sideshow will do just that within the ground-floor lobby, mezzanine, and Tank spaces at the Chicago Athletic Association.
Finally, we believe that architecture is much more than just buildings—architecture is a cultural body of ideas about space, form, material, and program that informs how we inhabit a city. The Sideshow’s monthly Friday night events will partner with exhibition contributors, artists, and cultural producers working outside of architecture to produce dynamic programming. This will instigate conversations across Chicago’s cultural landscape, and will draw audiences from multiple cultural and creative enclaves to explore and celebrate ideas of otherness in our communities.

Risks & Challenges
The Sideshow’s biggest obstacle is simple financing. We have a stellar curatorial team, support from the Chicago Athletic Association and the Chicago Architecture Biennial for space and marketing, and a ready roster of talented contributors. All we need is a few (thousand) dollars to bring the show to life.
In addition to the generous support we receive from this campaign, we are applying for supplementary grants, and donating our own time and resources to ensure the exhibition’s success.

Our project is collaborative, somewhat open-ended, and best of all, wildly engaging.

Now we are inviting artists to reflect on the Dumpster-to-home transformation and create work that broadens our collective view of sustainability.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435290213/ho3kczjh8vyvlzxpfahk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We've learned that the challenge of transforming a trash dumpster into a tiny sustainable home inspires creative problem solving. We’ve seen second graders imagine bike-powered appliances, green builders envision heat-storing wax walls, and activists discuss “dumpster footprints” as an environmental impact measure. Now we invite even broader forms of thought-provoking experimentation with our <a href=""http://dumpsterproject.org/creative/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Creative-in-Residence</a> program. We're inviting artists and creators of all types to take on the dumpster challenge and re-envision some aspect of the project as we investigate the impacts of modern life.

When Bernadette learned that we wanted to insulate the dumpster with natural materials, she immediately brainstormed ways to use reclaimed fabric. She decided on wool, which is a good insulator and improves air quality - a plus in our very small space. Bernadette designed and created a vibrant insulating wall panel from reclaimed wool that depicts the core Dumpster Project values of sustainability, home, and experimentation.

If we want to build a sustainable home as a teaching and learning experiment, why don't we just use a shipping container or build a small eco-friendly home from scratch? There are two big reasons we use a tiny dumpster. The first has to do with exactly that, size. The dumpster is small! It has a 6’ by 6’ footprint on the ground and the interior square footage is about 36 square feet. This makes our task more challenging and pushes us to really innovate and rethink.</p><p>The second reason is that dumpsters are symbols of, and receptacles for, waste. Many times, we throw trash into the dumpster and rarely consider where it goes after that, or what sort of impact we are having on the planet as a result. A big goal of the Dumpster Project is to raise awareness by making these invisible processes that affect us and the planet very tangible...say by transforming that very same magic waste-disappearing box into a home where every environmental repercussion is very apparent.</p><div>

Contributing Artists
It's the Journey:  We will journey with these artists over the next few weeks as their creations unfold and find out how their sundry works of art help develop their primary focus.  We will share more about what they are creating along the way. An event to  organize around, a deadline, and community: That's what Tribal Breeze is about.



Adam & Sharla Nickel - Adam is a filmmaker and Sharla a writer.  If you are doing anything even remotely courageous or worthwhile in the world, then they are your biggest fans, and she is our editor!

Amanda Rivera - Amanda is not just an artist, she is art. Whatever she touches comes alive, whether its stage, a vintage garb, or an empty canvas. 

Anonymous - Everything is art, step lightly, expect brilliance.  We expect as we journey that others will want to join.  We will add their items at random.

Emily Sulzberger- Emily is a student at Stella Adler and enjoys acting, singing, and storytelling.  She brightens a room the moment she enters.

Ernesto and Simona Escobar - Have managed restaurants and coffee shops and will soon have one of their own.  They have many talents, but share a love for found treasure and making something old new.

Kyla Giron - Kyla has been creating beautiful art since she could hold a paintbrush, and has excelled at many different mediums. She also enjoys running and personal training.  

Lena Giron - Lena is our catalyst who enjoys songwriting and filmmaking and lives to inspire others to live out their fullest potential through art and community projects.

Meg Giron - Meg is a math student at UCSC who loves dance and photography. You will savor the nostalgia she unearths in every photograph.  Her photographs are taken old school on 35mm film.

Nicolai Dorian - Nicolai is a seasoned actor who has an eye for chillness whether it's old cars, or photography which has him curating art shows at various venues in the LA area.

Tribe LA -  may let you think she is shy, but what boldness as she takes her drums and sings a melodious timbal improv.  Tribe LA is a place an artist can find community.
   What We Need & What You Get We need:  Most creative people simply need something to organize around and a deadline.  This is our biggest need.  
You get:  A great tote full of beautiful creations and the satisfaction that you helped teach a community to fish rather than simply giving them fish. And you will be first to see some of the works from these artists, many of whom are also teachers, writers, actors, dancers, musicians, filmmakers, inventors, and entrepreneurs.    The Impact Lena, Meg and Kyla are going to Ecuador this month with The Justice Group to serve the poor and free young people from trafficking.  Our goal is also to make a lasting impact.  We will start one of these projects in Ecuador and share that journey with you.  Every bag helps towards that goal as well as helping some local artists. 
Each of our contributing artists has a story, some have taken small steps towards long held dreams and others have felt a bit stuck.  Either way we are building community and momentum.
    Risks & Challenges The greatest risk we face is failing to see the importance of creativity and wasting our potential.  
So if an actor takes a beautiful photo and does nothing with it since there's so many 'real' photographers out there, it is like a seed that is never planted.  If, instead, that actor puts that seed in the ground by using the photo even in the smallest way, it has the potential to bring forth all of his strengths, problem solving, community involvement and his fullest potential as an actor. 
Every endeavor brings challenge, which in turn ignites creativity.
    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Use the Indiegogo share tools!

There will a job board where dancers, singers, etc. will be able to post their talent along with their contact info so any interested parties can get in touch with them. 6. We will be including a live stream feature for performers. This is for their fans. They will be able to live stream their gigs straight to their profile, where their fans will be notified of the live stream so they can watch. This will also be available to all artists looking to live stream their process.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Our campaign is non-profit</b>, <b>all money raised goes towards purchasing toilet paper </b>and the costs are listed below. We welcome you to purchase a T.P. roll for us to distribute on your behalf or we will mail your order to you. Bonus if you live in Metro Vancouver, we will have an open house at ifyougiveashitvote headquarters where you could pick up your roll, so you can save on shipping costs. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We have two basic asks if you want to help us roll out the campaign:</p>
<p>1. We need you to <b>share our video</b> with your friends and family, to inspire as many Canadians to vote strategically.</p>
<p>2. We would love it if you <b>purchase some toilet paper</b>, and more importantly, wiped your bum with it. Now we know these T.P. rolls are not cheap, and we searched for a local printer to no avail. A supplier from Illinois offered us the best price and fastest shipping. All prices below are per roll:</p>
<p>·  Custom Printed Toilet Paper: $7.25 (includes Sales Tax) Don't believe us? Check out our supplier, based on 500 minimum roll order. <a href=""http://www.asi71068.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.asi71068.com/</span></a><br/>
·  American Shipping UPS: $1.20<br/>
·  Import Duty: $1.00<br/>
·  CDN Taxes (GST + PST): $0.90<br/>
·  Shipping is same price for 1 to 3 rolls and varies only slightly from BC to Quebec and beyond: $10.50</p>
<p>We offer Five Perks:</p>
<p>·  Perk #1: If you make a donation to our campaign by purchasing a roll or more, we will distribute your roll in a swing riding where we desperately need people to vote strategically. Total for 1 ROLL with NO shipping $11.00. *If you live in Metro Vancouver and want to pick up your roll at ifyougiveashitvote headquarters and save $, purchase this perk.* </p><p>·  Perk #2: If you want your own roll we will ship a roll directly to your house. Total for 1 ROLL with shipping: $22.00.</p>
<p><span>·  Perk #3: If you want two rolls shipped directly to your house. Total for 2 ROLLS with shipping: $33.00 (that's only $16.50 per roll!)</span></p>
<p><span>·  Perk #4: If you want three rolls shipped directly to your house. Total for 3 ROLLS with shipping: $43.00 (that's only $14.33 per roll!)</span></p>
<p>·  Perk #5: If you want four rolls shipped directly to your house. Total for 4 ROLLS with shipping: $54.00 (that's only $12.98 per roll!)</p>
<p>Expensive for a single roll of toilet paper? Definitely. But the joy of wiping your ass with Harper's face? PRICELESS.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>To the conservative advantage, Canada’s political landscape has split the progressive vote three ways. This has lead to the <b>Harper Government winning the last election with 39% of the popular vote, but getting 100% of the power</b>. We are at a time when progressive Canadians need to vote together and vote strategically. We want the next government to bring in some form of proportional representation, so no Canadian’s vote is wasted. We hope to make people laugh, discuss politics, pull up their pants and get out there and VOTE!</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We recognize time is short, but we have assurances from the printer that they can rush the job. We are confident we can execute receiving the American shipment and process the Canadian shipment and have the T.P. rolls in people’s hands 5 days prior to the election. Sufficient time for even the most bunged up supporters.</p><br/></div>","Are you worried that Stephen Harper will be re-elected on October 19th? We're scared shitless! Well not quite, butt close.

What is Eco_Hack 2016 ?
Eco_Hack events center around large-scale, physical + digital + biological spaces. In addition to being installation artwork in their own right, these interactive environments serve as unique platforms for invited artists to create additional ambitious, multidisciplinary works.This summer, Eco_Hack 2016 is taking place at Mary Mattingly’s Swale, a floating food forest on the Hudson River. In addition to Biome Arts' interactive bio-digital installation, Eco_Hack 2016 will include a performance series, activist summit, and skill-share workshops that are free and open to the public.Diagram of power and digital system for Eco_Hack 2016Prototype of forest projections for Eco_Hack 2016Who is Biome Arts?
Biome Arts is a collective of artists, designers, engineers, biologists, and activists collaborating to make art that anticipate the next global paradigm: sustainable, open-source, commons-based culture. We're looking for alternatives to the destruction of the environment, copyright regimes that stifle innovation, and property regimes that diminish our common space.

Biome Arts’ previous installation “The Core”
Your Contribution Will Support
THE INSTALLATION gathers environmental data (precipitation, wind, moisture, plant growth, etc.) from the surrounding plants and projects interactive data visualizations back onto the structure and forest.

PERFORMANCES such as Shake by Lucia Monge, which uses a speculative language informed by the installation’s data to translate the movement of trees to the human body.
ARTWORK such as Data Bell by Brian House, where the installation’s data is mapped to the parameters of ringing bells that subsequently change their character, reflecting the ""mood"" of the forest.
SKILL-SHARES in urban agriculture, renewable energy, mesh networks, data privacy, etc. that contribute to self-reliance, grassroots organizing, and community-run local infrastructures in NYC neighborhoods.
ACTIVIST SUMMIT focused on developing a Green-Black Alliance (Green Party - Pirate Party) in NYC, i.e. a unifying banner and support network for the diverse initiatives and groups that currently support clean energy, cooperative economics, and open data in NYC and globally.
FLOATING COMMUNITY CENTER that functions as a lab, theater, gallery, school, and forum that offers an experimental, open-source response to climate change for NYC and other coastal communities around the world.






What We Need



We've secured funding from grants, foundations, patrons, and are soliciting in-kind donations from manufacturers and companies throughout our network. We are also asking for your help in raising the following:

MINIMUM BENCHMARK: $10,000 - We can make a smaller-scale version of the structure and create an installation that includes a basic sensor network, essential computing power, a solar array capable of minimal power duration, and 2 projectors for partial coverage of Swale.
FULL GOAL: $20,000 - We can make a full-scale version of the structure, create an installation with a robust sensor network, 4 projectors for greater coverage, stronger computing capabilities for more complex graphics, a more powerful solar array, and embedded audio equipment.



Past Experience

Biome Arts has a proven track-record. In the summer of 2014, we created Eco_Hack 2014 : a two-week symposium on ecology, technology, and the commons that culminated in the construction of a networked, semi-autonomous structure in the woods of Delhi, New York. This structure housed five more expansive artworks created by participants:

Das Buch dokumentiert die ungewöhnliche Geschichte dieses Hausprojekts in der Auguststraße 10 in Berlin-Mitte, vom Aufbruch in den 90er Jahren bis heute.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Mehr über das Buch</span><br/>
</h3>
<p><i>Das Buch wurde in fünf Hauptkapitel strukturiert und durch einen umfangreichen Anhang ergänzt. Den Einstieg bilden Erinnerungen zur außerordentlichen historischen Situation nach dem Mauerfall, deren Chancen von Menschen aus Ost und West unterschiedlich wahrgenommen wurden. Das nächste Kapitel konzentriert sich auf das Haus in der Auguststraße 10 und seinen Standort in Berlin-Mitte. Hier werden der alternative Umgang mit Eigentum und die Herausforderung der Sanierung thematisiert. Es folgt das Kapitel »Kunst und Aktion«, das die künstlerischen Interventionen der KuLe im Stadtraum mit performativen Projekten und den Fassadeninstallationen beschreibt. Nach einem Einblick ins Innenleben der Gemeinschaft, bei dem verschiedene Generationen zu Wort kommen, wird dem Austausch mit den Nachbarschaften im näheren und weiteren Umfeld Raum gegeben.</i></p>
<p><i>Der Anhang besteht aus einer Timeline, die die Ereignisse und Aktivitäten von 26 Jahren chronologisch sichtbar macht, einem Glossar für Begriffe, die außerhalb der Szene kaum verstanden werden, sowie einem Index zu 18 Hausprojekten und Kunsthäusern, die in einer Verbindung mit der KuLe stehen oder gestanden haben. Die zahlreichen Querverweise innerhalb des Buches laden die Leser_innen dazu ein, sich die Inhalte auf eigenen Wegen zu erschließen.</i></p>
<p><i>Das Buch ist auf Deutsch und Englisch, was auch die Alltagskommunikation in der heutigen KuLe widerspiegelt, die meistens zwischen deutsch und englisch wechselt. </i></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Kunsthaus KuLe is the embodiment of a utopia as long-term experiment. For over 25 years, the idea to connect art and life has been practiced here as a collective way of life. This book documents the unusual history of the house project at Auguststraße 10 in Berlin-Mitte, from its beginnings in the ’90s until today. Numerous texts, interviews and rare photographs lend visibility to networks engaged in bottom-up urban development that have grown and transformed over decades. </i></p></blockquote>
<p>For the past two years we have been working together with 100 people, writers, translators, graphic designers, activists, artists, past and present '<i>KuLe</i>s', to bring together this archive documenting the past 25 years of the Kunsthaus <i>KuLe</i> as an example of alternative city development and squatting in Berlin.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful archive comprising 400 pages, including 100 full-colour pages, with essays, interviews, scientific texts, poems, drawings, surveys, a comic strip, an illustrated timeline, an extensive glossary and over 500 rare photos.</p>
<p>Now, in the final stages, we are asking for help to raise funds to cover the printing costs of the book. We need to raise €21,000 for the printing! Please support us in this final stage and become part of the collective process.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<h3><b><br/>In the Spirit of KuLe</b></h3>
<p>Together, we are writing our own history by amplifying the voices of many people who for us embody relevant aspects of a huge community. There are views from the inside and from the outside, from different vocational fields like art, theatre, music, architecture, urban planning, journalism, cultural management, art and the natural sciences as well as from educational, social and technological professions. We are activating a collective memory that points out developments and also contradictions, and that brings different opinions to the debate. We hope that reading this is fun, that it gives food for thought, opens up perspectives and maybe encourages new germinations. </p>
<p>As we began to think about a book on <i>KuLe</i>, it became clear that such a book would come from the need to capture a piece of contemporary history: to knot together invisible threads of memory, demonstrate relationships and prepare the ground for visions with images from the past and present.</p>
<p>This book will be both a collectors item, as well as an important archive not only about the Kunsthaus <i>KuLe</i> but about the history of Utopian living projects and the very particular history of Berlin squatting more generally. </p>

<h3>More about the Book</h3>
<p>The book has been structured into five main chapters and is complemented by an extensive appendix. We start with memories of the exceptional historical situation after the fall of the Berlin Wall, which provided opportunities that were perceived differently by people from East and West. Chapter two shifts the focus to the house at Auguststraße 10 and its location in Berlin-Mitte. Here, alternative ways of dealing with property and the challenges of renovation are addressed. Chapter three, “Art and Action,” describes <i>KuLe</i>’s artistic interventions in urban space through performative projects and facade installations. After a glimpse into the inner workings of the community, in which different generations have their say, room is given to exchanges with neighbours from near and far.</p>
<p>The appendix consists of a timeline that shows the events and activities of 26 years in chronological order, a <i>Glossary of terms </i>that are little understood outside of the scene as well as a <i>House-Project Index </i>of 18 projects and art houses that are or have been connected to <i>KuLe</i>. The numerous cross-references within the book invite readers to explore the content along their own paths. </p>
<p>The book is in both German and English, reflecting everyday communication in today’s <i>KuLe</i>, which mostly switches between the two languages. </p>

Das Kunsthaus KuLe steht für eine Utopie als Langzeitexperiment. Die Idee, Kunst und Leben zu verbinden, wird hier seit über 25 Jahren in gemeinschaftlicher Lebensform praktiziert. Das Buch dokumentiert die ungewöhnliche Geschichte dieses Hausprojekts in der Auguststraße 10 in Berlin-Mitte, vom Aufbruch in den 90er Jahren bis heute. Anhand von zahlreichen Texten, Interviews und einzigartigen Fotografien werden die seit Jahrzehnten gewachsenen Netzwerke einer Stadtentwicklung von unten sichtbar.In den letzten zwei Jahren haben wir mit über 100 Menschen am diesem Buch gearbeitet. Nach einem spannenden Prozess und vielen Arbeitsschritten sind wir nun tatsächlich fast am Ziel!Jetzt möchten wir unser Werk in die Welt schicken und mit vielen anderen diesen großen Erfahrungsschatz teilen. Es sind Geschichten, die den Mauerfall in Berlin und seine Auswirkungen bis heute widerspiegeln. Im Zentrum stehen Erfahrungen von Selbstermächtigung und die langjährige Praxis von Kunst und Leben in der Auguststraße 10 in Berlin-Mitte.Es ist ein wunderschönes Archiv von 400 Seiten, davon 100 Seiten mit Bildern in Farbe, vielen Essays und Interviews, wissenschaftlichen Texten, Gedichten, Umfragen, einem Comic, einem grafischen Zeitstrahl, einem umfangreichen Glossar, einem Index zu verwandten Hausprojekten sowie 500 außergewöhnlichen Fotos.Nun, im letzten Stadium vor der Realisierung, brauchen wir die Hilfe einer großen Community um die Druckkosten des Buches zu decken. Unser Fundingziel ist 21.000€. Bitte unterstütze uns in dieser letzten Etappe und werde Teil des kollektiven Prozesses!Spirit von KuLeAls wir anfingen, über ein Buch über die KuLe nachzudenken, entstand dies aus dem Bedürfnis, ein Stück Zeitgeschichte einzufangen, die unsichtbaren Fäden von Erinnerungen miteinander zu verknüpfen, Beziehungen aufzuzeigen und mit Bildern aus Vergangenheit und Gegenwart einen Boden für Visionen zu bereiten.Dieses Buch wird ein wichtiges Archiv sein, nicht nur über das Kunsthaus KuLe, sondern auch über verwandte Hausprojekte, die nach dem Fall der Berliner Mauer – im „Sommer der Anarchie“ – entstanden sind und den besonderen Reiz Berlins bis heute prägen.


 


Mehr über das Buch

Das Buch wurde in fünf Hauptkapitel strukturiert und durch einen umfangreichen Anhang ergänzt. Den Einstieg bilden Erinnerungen zur außerordentlichen historischen Situation nach dem Mauerfall, deren Chancen von Menschen aus Ost und West unterschiedlich wahrgenommen wurden. Das nächste Kapitel konzentriert sich auf das Haus in der Auguststraße 10 und seinen Standort in Berlin-Mitte. Hier werden der alternative Umgang mit Eigentum und die Herausforderung der Sanierung thematisiert. Es folgt das Kapitel »Kunst und Aktion«, das die künstlerischen Interventionen der KuLe im Stadtraum mit performativen Projekten und den Fassadeninstallationen beschreibt. Nach einem Einblick ins Innenleben der Gemeinschaft, bei dem verschiedene Generationen zu Wort kommen, wird dem Austausch mit den Nachbarschaften im näheren und weiteren Umfeld Raum gegeben.
Der Anhang besteht aus einer Timeline, die die Ereignisse und Aktivitäten von 26 Jahren chronologisch sichtbar macht, einem Glossar für Begriffe, die außerhalb der Szene kaum verstanden werden, sowie einem Index zu 18 Hausprojekten und Kunsthäusern, die in einer Verbindung mit der KuLe stehen oder gestanden haben. Die zahlreichen Querverweise innerhalb des Buches laden die Leser_innen dazu ein, sich die Inhalte auf eigenen Wegen zu erschließen.
Das Buch ist auf Deutsch und Englisch, was auch die Alltagskommunikation in der heutigen KuLe widerspiegelt, die meistens zwischen deutsch und englisch wechselt.

The Book Project & Our Goal
Kunsthaus KuLe is the embodiment of a utopia as long-term experiment. For over 25 years, the idea to connect art and life has been practiced here as a collective way of life. This book documents the unusual history of the house project at Auguststraße 10 in Berlin-Mitte, from its beginnings in the ’90s until today. Numerous texts, interviews and rare photographs lend visibility to networks engaged in bottom-up urban development that have grown and transformed over decades. 
For the past two years we have been working together with 100 people, writers, translators, graphic designers, activists, artists, past and present 'KuLes', to bring together this archive documenting the past 25 years of the Kunsthaus KuLe as an example of alternative city development and squatting in Berlin.
It is a beautiful archive comprising 400 pages, including 100 full-colour pages, with essays, interviews, scientific texts, poems, drawings, surveys, a comic strip, an illustrated timeline, an extensive glossary and over 500 rare photos.
Now, in the final stages, we are asking for help to raise funds to cover the printing costs of the book. We need to raise €21,000 for the printing! Please support us in this final stage and become part of the collective process.


In the Spirit of KuLe
Together, we are writing our own history by amplifying the voices of many people who for us embody relevant aspects of a huge community. There are views from the inside and from the outside, from different vocational fields like art, theatre, music, architecture, urban planning, journalism, cultural management, art and the natural sciences as well as from educational, social and technological professions. We are activating a collective memory that points out developments and also contradictions, and that brings different opinions to the debate. We hope that reading this is fun, that it gives food for thought, opens up perspectives and maybe encourages new germinations. 
As we began to think about a book on KuLe, it became clear that such a book would come from the need to capture a piece of contemporary history: to knot together invisible threads of memory, demonstrate relationships and prepare the ground for visions with images from the past and present.
This book will be both a collectors item, as well as an important archive not only about the Kunsthaus KuLe but about the history of Utopian living projects and the very particular history of Berlin squatting more generally. 




More about the Book
The book has been structured into five main chapters and is complemented by an extensive appendix. We start with memories of the exceptional historical situation after the fall of the Berlin Wall, which provided opportunities that were perceived differently by people from East and West. Chapter two shifts the focus to the house at Auguststraße 10 and its location in Berlin-Mitte. Here, alternative ways of dealing with property and the challenges of renovation are addressed. Chapter three, “Art and Action,” describes KuLe’s artistic interventions in urban space through performative projects and facade installations. After a glimpse into the inner workings of the community, in which different generations have their say, room is given to exchanges with neighbours from near and far.
The appendix consists of a timeline that shows the events and activities of 26 years in chronological order, a Glossary of terms that are little understood outside of the scene as well as a House-Project Index of 18 projects and art houses that are or have been connected to KuLe. The numerous cross-references within the book invite readers to explore the content along their own paths. 
The book is in both German and English, reflecting everyday communication in today’s KuLe, which mostly switches between the two languages.

Wie die KuLe selbst, ist auch das Buch Teil eines kollektiven Prozesses, der sich weiterentwickelt.

Eine Kaffeeklatsch Haustour oder ein Wochenende für zwei machen es möglich. Alle Perks ab 35€ beinhalten ein KuLe-Buch.

<p>
</p>
<p>You may know Ashley and I as friends, family,
your kid’s art teachers or through our past projects which include Gaff Gallery
in Vancouver and Galerie Rye in Montreal. Here’s a quick re-cap to get you
caught up with us:</p>
<p>After working our tails off trying to make it
as independent gallery proprietors and artists, while working day jobs, etc. we
decided to teach overseas. We have been teaching art in Qatar (whole story
there) for the past four years, saving towards our next project- and this is it!
Two years ago we bought a 52 acre farm in Tamworth, Ontario (about a 30min
drive north of Kingston). It’s gorgeous—
rolling hills right on the Salmon River, 100 year old timber barn, plus a house
and smaller second barn. The place is ideal for what we have been wanting to do
for some time now: set up studios and get to work making art and continuing the
community driven cultural activities that we enjoyed so much at our previous
venues. But this time it’s different– we are not in the city and we are not running
an exhibition space (although there will be exhibitions surely). With Salmon
River Studios we will focus all of our energy into arts production and
providing cultural and educational opportunities to our local community with a
long term goal of broadening that community nationally and internationally.</p>
<br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460145494/barn_mpnzse.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have already begun converting the barns
into studios for printmaking, painting, drawing, ceramics and sculpture where
we will create our own work and invite the public to take part through lessons
and workshops for all ages and skill levels. The barns are in excellent shape
but need some sprucing up with things like improved lighting and plumbing and
to make them as functional as possible we need to supplement the equipment that
we already have.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Luckily the Doucette Pilles Deerman gang are
can-do people so we will be completing most of the improvements ourselves.
However, materials and equipment are necessary expenses.</p>
<p>In our past arts endeavours people have often
commented that we are ‘brave’ for trying to go out on our own and try to make
these ventures work. Brave is one way to put it- it often feels like <i>crazy</i> would
be a more apt description. However, we have always been surprised at how
excited and eager people are to support independent arts venues and participate
in community driven cultural activities. We never felt alone in our
efforts and are confident that Salmon River Studios will be a long term
culmination to many years of ground work and will contribute to the Canadian
and global arts community beginning with our little corner of the world.</p>
<p>That said- we have put our savings into
obtaining this property, are leaving our steady pay checks and are returning to
Canada (with our new baby boy Sylvan!!!) and plan to supply teach part time
(substitute teaching) to make ends meet. We have some savings to sustain us
through this transition but are humbly asking that those of you who like what
we’ve done in the past and/or like our artwork will help us by contributing and
helping us get this place rolling!</p>
<p>Your contributions will expand the
possibilities of what types of work can be done in our facilities, what
services and opportunities for artists we can offer and will hasten our
progress in meeting the potential that we know this special place has.</p>

<p>My name is Patrick. I am a freelance artist specializing in anthropomorphic art with a background in graphic design and animation. Recently I have had quite a number of friends who have gotten into a really cool new trend: adult coloring books. I would like to create a furry coloring book that not only provides a entertainment to people of all skill levels but also provide a variety of subjects catered to the Furry Fandom.</p>
<p><br/>I started doodling furries 14 years ago in high school. Since then I have went to school for graphic design and animation. Deciding illustration was my passion I have been working on small projects such as book covers, logos for small businesses, and commissioned illustrations. I would ideally like to work on small independent publications like this and make a name for myself in the realm of illustration and comic books. </p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <p>All funding of this project will be used to publish an initial run of the book along with any stretch rewards listed below.  I'm aiming for a publish date of March 4th with a minimum of 34 pages for your colouring enjoyment. Over the last 2 weeks I have completed about 20 illustrations and I have a month to complete any additional illustrations. </p>
<p>All funding up to the goal will go to ensuring you get your book and provide a small number of on hand books for conventions and shows. Anything past this will help to fund the production of new books after this specifically the supplies I need to continue producing quality illustrations and the initial production costs.</p>
<p>So now that you've read what this project is all about let me share some of the initial illustrations going into this book:</p>

<p>How have Native and African Americans been written out of American history, and  what does this mean to contemporary political
and social ideologies? <i>Race and
Revolution: Exploring Racial Injustices through Art</i> is a group art show
that will address this question by pairing historical documents that reveal requests the American and British armies made - with the intention to exploit - of Indigenous and African
American peoples to get them to fight for their causes during the American
Revolution. Through original works, artists will respond to excerpts from
historic documents written by George Washington, Lord Dunmore, John Adams, and
others. Governors Island in New York City is the perfect location because soldiers from the
Continental Army were based there until the British took it over during the Battle of Brooklyn in 1776.</p>
<p>The objective of this exhibition is to
question how Colonial entitlement is embedded in contemporary culture and to address the connection between the history of how African American and Native peoples were - and continue to be - regarded today.</p>

<p style=""display: inline !important;""><b style=""background-color: initial;""></b></p><p><span><b>Who am I and what the HECK is this thing?</b></span></p><p>My name is Andrea Aguilar and this project tells the story about how I quit my job to build a creative community centered around Filipino culture. After more than 10 years of telling the stories for others as a television producer and filmmaker, I attended Burning Man. It was at the biggest cultural and arts festival in the world that I realized the importance of telling your own story and embracing who you are. Through reconnecting with my roots I decided to build an art project, start a camp, and film a documentary to tell the story of how one can one <b>discover</b> and <b>connect </b>with your culture through art.</p><p>If you can find the biggest, brightest symbol for a group of people it will <b>spark </b>conversation and provide the opportunity to learn who they are. An undeniable symbol unique to the Philippines is the Jeepney, a popular mode of public transportation that also serve as moving works of art. Customized to the individual taste of each driver, brighter and crazier the Jeepney, the more people will want to ride. Drivers are rewarded to display their personality and creativity - something I believe we need more of in the world!</p><p>To honor this very Filipino cultural icon, I am creating my own Jeepney to put on display at Burning Man. We have partnered with <a href=""www.digitalpermaculture.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Digital Permacultur</a>e to modify it the image of the endangered Philippine eagle. Using their own state-of-the-art software and 3D mapping, we outfit our jeepney with a steel frame covered in fabric and line it with LED’s for spectacular lighting.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/etFacRvIpLdUmzUNREFrfyIa4n8IHWlFb9-8Sy-wau52qW7HE3fx_l6nkoMDLZMtKcgWiDohJnNCyjS3w8JTqFSOMZBqqkGo-8eiehY3E3bpgriMo5ohnXNA1lj631FGdFrxW7-Z"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jdzR795lCl8e_83IJxfQ_4KMl6-XG3vLEv6_pJVhr3GtQivQJpqir79EXZe84K4Jzik4CKdHtWa1BvDW6n8UpQNT8_13l4yWIOYPMCJ_tpQ5IWNXdGcSWaTF5yhiM9mUVuadqbEa"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Fighter is an endangered eagle I met at the Philippine Eagle Center in Davao.</i></p><br/><p><b>Our Mission:</b></p><p>Along with building the car we are founding a Burning Man theme camp called It’s More Fun in the Philippines!

We will show how <b>active participation</b> in your life, embracing your culture and creating something beautiful can help give meaning to your world. The inspiration for the shape of the car has also led me to standing up to fight for the endangered Philippine eagle and draw attention to those trying to save the species.</p><p>I want to show what injecting an <b>underrepresented</b> demographic at Burning Man will do for the event and see the reaction from our Filipino campers who have never experienced something like this. Sharing the result in our documentary will allow me to spread the message of Burning Man of how you can improve your society by adopting principles taught such as participation, leaving no trace, and decommodification. For a country where environmental issues, consumerism, and disproportionate wealth create increasing problems, I hope to inspire and spark change in the Philippines. Due to these issues, our people have spread out all over the world. We’re still connected through where we come from, but never truly feel settled. My ultimate goal is to help form a bond between creative Filipinos to each other in hopes to co-create something beautiful together.</p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/yp8mHR9Jfs4qBYokRehtgo81E0cfwOKk-UdjpNDFuTQtuwCUVJJjsayzWGQyf5YwO1Plkt7cqYy0EZerZ_VJrD6X8rlxnuSRMFcIhxS348Uay0I1el5VcRDvYrkE4IQzh7YRH59r"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Gingee is a DJ, Music Producer, Vocalist and Music Teacher.</i></p><p><i style=""background-color: initial;""></i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468564796/yana_qdo0fs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Chef Yana, will host the playa's first-ever Salo Series Filipino pop-up dinner.</i></p><p><i style=""background-color: initial;"">(Photo Credit: Katie Herst)</i></p><br/><p><b>We Need Your Help!</b></p><p>Your generous funding will help with the costs of further design, construction, and transportation of the car.

<p><b>More about Me:</b></p>
<p>Growing up in Southern California I set out to tell stories through film and television. Working with so many who followed their passion helped me make the decision to tell my own story as I set out for the Philippines and reconnect with my culture. After 45 days in my native land, I traveled to all three major regions of the Philippines: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. The biggest issue I noticed affected the Philippines is deforestation due to climate change, illegal mining, slash and burn practices, and overall rapid consumption of all of our natural resources. From my visit at the Philippine Eagle Center, I learned the country’s eco-system is extremely out of balance. There are roughly only 400 pairs of these endemic eagles left. They also are the largest predator found in the region and keep order to the forest.</p>
<p>This is a clear sign, that we need to take action and quickly. I’m excited to report that I was able to connect with passionate Filipinos involved in social enterprises, dedicated to improving the livelihoods of others through sustainable practices. I’ve come to the realization that this is my call to come back home to restore the forests through education and eco-tourism. I now plan to return to the Philippines consistently to help make a direct impact and continue to build the community of forward thinking Filipinos who are making a real difference in keeping our culture alive and preserving our beautiful land.</p>

</div></div>","Who am I and what the HECK is this thing?My name is Andrea Aguilar and this project tells the story about how I quit my job to build a creative community centered around Filipino culture. After more than 10 years of telling the stories for others as a television producer and filmmaker, I attended Burning Man. It was at the biggest cultural and arts festival in the world that I realized the importance of telling your own story and embracing who you are. Through reconnecting with my roots I decided to build an art project, start a camp, and film a documentary to tell the story of how one can one discover and connect with your culture through art.If you can find the biggest, brightest symbol for a group of people it will spark conversation and provide the opportunity to learn who they are. An undeniable symbol unique to the Philippines is the Jeepney, a popular mode of public transportation that also serve as moving works of art. Customized to the individual taste of each driver, brighter and crazier the Jeepney, the more people will want to ride. Drivers are rewarded to display their personality and creativity - something I believe we need more of in the world!To honor this very Filipino cultural icon, I am creating my own Jeepney to put on display at Burning Man. We have partnered with Digital Permaculture to modify it the image of the endangered Philippine eagle. Using their own state-of-the-art software and 3D mapping, we outfit our jeepney with a steel frame covered in fabric and line it with LED’s for spectacular lighting.Fighter is an endangered eagle I met at the Philippine Eagle Center in Davao.Our Mission:Along with building the car we are founding a Burning Man theme camp called It’s More Fun in the Philippines! Our camp will both be the home base for everyone involved with the car, but also a place to invite visitors in to showcase unique Filipino culture through art, food, and music. We will show how active participation in your life, embracing your culture and creating something beautiful can help give meaning to your world. The inspiration for the shape of the car has also led me to standing up to fight for the endangered Philippine eagle and draw attention to those trying to save the species.I want to show what injecting an underrepresented demographic at Burning Man will do for the event and see the reaction from our Filipino campers who have never experienced something like this. Sharing the result in our documentary will allow me to spread the message of Burning Man of how you can improve your society by adopting principles taught such as participation, leaving no trace, and decommodification. For a country where environmental issues, consumerism, and disproportionate wealth create increasing problems, I hope to inspire and spark change in the Philippines. Due to these issues, our people have spread out all over the world. We’re still connected through where we come from, but never truly feel settled. My ultimate goal is to help form a bond between creative Filipinos to each other in hopes to co-create something beautiful together.Gingee is a DJ, Music Producer, Vocalist and Music Teacher.Chef Yana, will host the playa's first-ever Salo Series Filipino pop-up dinner.(Photo Credit: Katie Herst)We Need Your Help!Your generous funding will help with the costs of further design, construction, and transportation of the car. Donations also will go to providing unique Filipino services to contribute at Burning Man to bring visitors into our camp to share our culture.

</div><p></p><h3>Bring Ballenarca to Puerto Rico!</h3> <p>Ballenarca, the giant whale puppet, has traveled the road across the United States, displaying her magical world for people of all ages to experience.  Her tires have tread land for the past year pushing through miles of open hearts and minds, welcoming everyone into her creative vision. This surreal, interactive show has not only greatly impacted and changed the lives of her audience, but also everyone on crew that have dedicated their minds and countless hours into birthing this project. She was conceptualized to be a symbol of creation:  one with no boundaries, to be a free performance of music, puppetry, costume and dance, and to grow a community of makers, musicians and activists for free art!  A show designed to travel and exist in the streets for people walking by to experience surprise, delight and unpredicted revelations. She was built in Austin, Texas as a collaboration with makers from Austin and Poncili Creación of Puerto Rico.</p><p>Due to the limitations and physical exhaustions of the road, she is aging fast and needs your help to get to the Homeland of her family: PUERTO RICO!!! She will make the trip to Florida and then take the ferry to San Juan.  We want to take her to Puerto Rico because more than half of her builders and crew are from the island and she is very well known there.  She will be loved and welcomed into the vibrant art community and delight the island with her magic.  When she arrives in Puerto Rico she will be joined by members of prior Ballenarca tours, both from Puerto Rico and Texas.  She will tour around the city and hopefully the entire island.  After her tour she will reside at the Kuniklo Puppet House, an artist collective of former Ballenarca members in the mountains above San Juan.  There she will become a living installation for future shows and projects.  </p><p></p><h3>What we will need</h3>There are many elements involved in transporting a giant trailer-bound whale across the Gulf of Mexico.  The most important part of this scenario is the ferry.  To take the ferry from Florida to San Juan would cost approximately $2000.  At this moment, the whale is in Austin, TX, so we would have to drive her to Florida, costing at least $1500.  After those expenses, we need to refurbish the whale and remake several puppets that have deteriorated, this would cost roughly $800.  The remaining $700 will be put towards securing a viable vehicle to tow the whale when she reaches Puerto Rico, as well as living expenses for the members of the Whale Crew.  <p></p><p>Our rewards are handmade art prints from our members and reprints of our Ballenarca L'Éxpedition Magnifique zine and Ballenarca T-shirts.  Our art is whimsical and charming and makes a perfect complement to a donation. </p><p>If we do not reach our goal, we will use the money that we do make to refurbish the whale.  As of now, she is in serious need of some sprucing.  She has been lying dormant for almost a year and the old girl can use any help she can get.  </p><p>If we surpass our goal, we will use the funds to tour further than the San Juan area, taking Ballenarca around the coasts and countryside of Puerto Rico.  </p><div>
<ul></ul> </div><div>
<h3>The impact </h3> <span style=""background-color: initial;"">With this campaign we intend to broaden the impact that Ballenarca has already had.  Ballenarca belongs in Puerto Rico, where she can delight children and communities for years to come.  Since she is a mobile stage, the opportunities are endless for performances, events and workshops.  The creative community of Puerto Rico is ready for her.  Local artists who helped create her, and have given presentations about Ballenarca at the yearly puppetry festival in San Juan.  People of the community are familiar with her and have always wanted to experience her first hand.  This will be an amazing opportunity to bring her to a community where she would have a lasting and much appreciated effect. </span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><h3>Our Other Successful Campaigns</h3> </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Ballenarca has a long and successful history. Ballenarca is the brain child of maker Chereya Esters.  Ballenarca was made in Austin, TX in November 2014.  She was a crowdfunded project, raising over $5000 to create her from an old trailer and found foam.  Ballenarca went on tour in December 2014 from Austin, TX to Miami Art Basel.  In 2015, Ballenarca launched on her second voyage, La Éxpedition Magnifique.  She went from Austin, TX through the midwest and down the east coast on a month long self-sustaining tour.  She visited the National Puppetry Convention at UCONN and performed at many museums, parks and creative spaces.  Her impact was incredible, as you can see by the delighted faces of the children and adults in our video.  </span><ul> <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>
</ul>
</div><div>

This surreal, interactive show has not only greatly impacted and changed the lives of her audience, but also everyone on crew that have dedicated their minds and countless hours into birthing this project. She was conceptualized to be a symbol of creation:  one with no boundaries, to be a free performance of music, puppetry, costume and dance, and to grow a community of makers, musicians and activists for free art!  A show designed to travel and exist in the streets for people walking by to experience surprise, delight and unpredicted revelations. She was built in Austin, Texas as a collaboration with makers from Austin and Poncili Creación of Puerto Rico.Due to the limitations and physical exhaustions of the road, she is aging fast and needs your help to get to the Homeland of her family: PUERTO RICO!!! She will make the trip to Florida and then take the ferry to San Juan.  We want to take her to Puerto Rico because more than half of her builders and crew are from the island and she is very well known there.  She will be loved and welcomed into the vibrant art community and delight the island with her magic.  When she arrives in Puerto Rico she will be joined by members of prior Ballenarca tours, both from Puerto Rico and Texas.  She will tour around the city and hopefully the entire island.  After her tour she will reside at the Kuniklo Puppet House, an artist collective of former Ballenarca members in the mountains above San Juan.  There she will become a living installation for future shows and projects.  What we will needThere are many elements involved in transporting a giant trailer-bound whale across the Gulf of Mexico.  The most important part of this scenario is the ferry.  To take the ferry from Florida to San Juan would cost approximately $2000.  At this moment, the whale is in Austin, TX, so we would have to drive her to Florida, costing at least $1500.  After those expenses, we need to refurbish the whale and remake several puppets that have deteriorated, this would cost roughly $800.  The remaining $700 will be put towards securing a viable vehicle to tow the whale when she reaches Puerto Rico, as well as living expenses for the members of the Whale Crew.  Our rewards are handmade art prints from our members and reprints of our Ballenarca L'Éxpedition Magnifique zine and Ballenarca T-shirts.  Our art is whimsical and charming and makes a perfect complement to a donation. If we do not reach our goal, we will use the money that we do make to refurbish the whale.  As of now, she is in serious need of some sprucing.  She has been lying dormant for almost a year and the old girl can use any help she can get.  If we surpass our goal, we will use the funds to tour further than the San Juan area, taking Ballenarca around the coasts and countryside of Puerto Rico.  
 
The impact  With this campaign we intend to broaden the impact that Ballenarca has already had.  Ballenarca belongs in Puerto Rico, where she can delight children and communities for years to come.  Since she is a mobile stage, the opportunities are endless for performances, events and workshops.  The creative community of Puerto Rico is ready for her.  Local artists who helped create her, and have given presentations about Ballenarca at the yearly puppetry festival in San Juan.  People of the community are familiar with her and have always wanted to experience her first hand.  This will be an amazing opportunity to bring her to a community where she would have a lasting and much appreciated effect. 

Our Other Successful Campaigns Ballenarca has a long and successful history. Ballenarca is the brain child of maker Chereya Esters.  Ballenarca was made in Austin, TX in November 2014.  She was a crowdfunded project, raising over $5000 to create her from an old trailer and found foam.  Ballenarca went on tour in December 2014 from Austin, TX to Miami Art Basel.  In 2015, Ballenarca launched on her second voyage, La Éxpedition Magnifique.  She went from Austin, TX through the midwest and down the east coast on a month long self-sustaining tour.  She visited the National Puppetry Convention at UCONN and performed at many museums, parks and creative spaces.  Her impact was incredible, as you can see by the delighted faces of the children and adults in our video.    


Risks and Challenges There will be many challenges in this project.  In all of her incarnations, Ballenarca has faced incredible adversity.  But because our team is so strong and our network so supportive, we have been able to overcome the many challenges that we have faced.  Our greatest challenge in this upcoming project will be all the modes of transportation that Ballenarca will need to get her from Texas to Puerto Rico.  The truck to get her to Florida and the ferry to San Juan pose the biggest risks.  We have always had to deal with a myriad of mechanical failures in our past tours, but we have always found a way to overcome.

Summary</h3>
<p>If one were to
ask what type of artist I consider myself  I would say that I am an eclectic visualist.
This is because I’m always looking for new discoveries and I create a variety
of work from traditional contemporary, to a digital tech style.</p>
<p>I have been
drawing since the age of 5 and I would have never guessed that my
childhood interests would spark my artistry as an adult. I received my B.F.A
from the School of Visual Arts in New
  York in 1988 but didn’t come out on the art scene
until 1990.</p>
<p> My debut as an artist was at an Expo at the Javits Center
in New York  where I had gone by my artist name (KEM). I
premiered my art work in the form of buttons and wearable art. I then realized
that there was a market for my work with its style of vivid colors and animated
expressions.</p>
<p>In 1992, I
attended the Print shop of master printer Bob Blackburn  where I studied
the basics of lithography and block printing. I have done well with Gallery
showcases in the state of Georgia
where I resided for five years between 1996 to 2001.  I relocated back to my home town of Brooklyn New York in 2001 and shifted my gears towards education
then became an arts instructor in New
  York City public schools.</p>
<p>In 1999 I
founded Artizfacts Visual Arts Specialist, a visual arts
communications platform for conveying thought provoking concepts in the
community through  means of creative
expression in multi-media for children. I am presently developing my independent
animated film, Employed as an arts instructor and proud owner/ curator of

     other emerging artist, I have provided a platform for exhibitions of their
     work and will continue to do so. I feel that an art space </li>
<li>should be practical

     exhibitors and viewers can benefit from.</li>
<li>Funds
     raised will have a great impact on exhibiting artwork with the correct

     modernizing the ceilings to conceal the raw industrial look of hanging

<p>Insight
into the risks and obstacles are as follows. There are none for the sponsors,

funded. All your time, energy and plans for funding can go bust. Your support
is so needed. I myself I'm not an expert at fundraising. Of course I don't have

<p>Here
are two ways I plan as a backup if my goal flops:</p>

</div>","I was born in Birmingham-UK and
was raised by the local care authority in rural Derbyshire in a residential school. At 16, I left school and wandered a lot
around the country trying to identify with myself. It was at this point in
my latter teens that I discovered art - mainly sculpture, but also drawing and
painting. Within this short leap of time I had fully engaged with art. I was
locked in, so to speak. I am in need of relocating asap
from my current work space of the past 9 years as my lease cannot be renewed
and I have not the funds for the move. The work spans most of my life's
testimony to the arts which is 29 years of paintings, sculpture and drawings in
mixed media.
A documentary
of my work has just been made - follow the link to view https:/vimeo.com/156612499 this is direct link to documentary http://www.corbiculadesign.co.uk/video_promotional.html   See also Gallery images and my Facebook
page and Website, which also contains my CV.
Moving this
back catalogue of various artworks is expensive, as it requires a specialist
removal firm, packing delicate and large pieces made in every conceivable
medium. Relocating will enable me to continue my life as an artist, share my
art and put it out to a wider audience.  
I have no choice but to ask for financial help as I cannot make
this move alone. 
Any help you are able to provide is very much
appreciated. You can make a financial contribution of any amount or select a ‘Perk’ (see examples below). Even
if you are not able to contribute financially,
you can help by sharing this campaign. My thanks to everyone for their support.
“I
have bought works from Paul for my own collection and feel lucky to have them. He
deserves all the help and support he can get and I feel that, given the right
opportunities and exposure, he will eventually receive the success and
acknowledgement he so richly deserves.”
- PETER RANDALL-PAGE, Internationally renowned sculptor and artist
“It is as though something inside him is trying to
get out, something wise and timeless, trying to communicate with the world
through Paul but yet they are as one. Somehow Paul is reconnecting us with our
primal selves, which can be exciting, moving, challenging, frightening.  Put simply, this feels like some higher
creative force has been placed in the hands of a very humble but very
passionate man.”
- AARON CUSTANCE, Biochemist""Anyone who experiences Paul's work will come to know that he is 'the real deal'. I have never met someone so genuine, so talented. Paul Devon Young is a true artistic genius, and I feel lucky to count him as a friend.""- ROBERT GALE, Editorial Artist, NEW YORK TIMES, 1980's-90's""I have a hectic lifestyle and am usually totally absorbed in my own work. What I find to my surprise is the peace and timeless wonderment that emanates from Paul's sculptures and paintings. It is as though they are actually trying to say something to me. I almost expect them to speak. I don't pretend to understand this, but it is a real phenomenon.""- SHAN MILLER, Artist and social entrepreneurThe general costs of relocating comprise:
Removal company to package and relocate delicate artworks.
Removal of large pieces which I will try to achieve with the kind help of friends.
Insurance costs.
Relocation and settlement costs.
The spaces I have been looking at so far seem to be units on industrial estates, so the unforeseen costs that will incur just for being in such a space.
There are always other costs that seem to keep coming up, as in the case of my present studio, which has become storage space,
Like the general public, most have to go out and get a job.  I have worked most of my life and believe in doing good for the wider community... When I eventually do relocate I need to establish asap rather than falling back into the zero finance zone that in a strange way I accepted, believing, well I suppose, I should just keep scraping the scraps and be grateful and I look at my work and keep finding other work to keep it together... ...and it is together in some ways. I have everything ready for the move.... I am hoping that via this campaign, works on my website, the generosity of the public, it can be seen that clarity is all that I have left.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The competition is fierce for finding teaching jobs, we will help recent MFA graduates gain more experience and build their resumes with the multitude of opportunities the TRAC will offer. Keep the arts alive; support local artists and educators!<b><br/></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>THE DETAILS:</b><br/></p>There are hundreds of galleries and studios available to artists in every city, but few that seek to actually help benefit the <i>artist</i>. Businesses that offer show space for an artist's work tend to charge an artist twice: once to rent the space, and again by taking a commission on any work sold. That commission is ~40%. This is standard practice. This practice forces an artist raise their prices in order to get a fair price on their work. The this makes artwork far too expensive for most art-lovers to buy, and thus most artists cannot sell their work and wind up in the negative. In addition, as galleries are commission based, art work is rarely rotated out, and the same art is on the walls month after month. This is boring for the customers, and disheartening for the artists. Bad for artists, bad for business.<br/><div align=""justify"">
<br/>Studio spaces are flat-out overpriced. Closet-sized spaces are rented for $200/month, with spaces not much bigger going for $400+. Finding a space artists can afford to work in, in order to create the art that they will have to pay twice to show it, in a place they won't be likely to sell it, is a vicious cycle. The term ""starving artist"" isn't a cliche, it's a reality.<br/><br/>Teaching jobs are difficult to find, especially right out of grad school. The competition is fierce and it's rare for grads to find something in their <i>state</i>, much less their field. If artists <i>can</i> find a teaching job, they often must relocate, it is usually temporary (adjunct), and introductory classes are all that will be thought qualified for. Grads often end up taking jobs in the non-art sector, sitting on their hard-won (not to mention expensive!) degrees. Creative
time and energy is wasted.<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>theTRAC Gallery &amp; Studios will change all of that</b>. theTRAC will provide an affordable, upscale place for artists of all disciplines (including literary and musical) to create, gain feedback, and show their work. We will provide large, budget-friendly studio spaces for rent, a gallery rented at a flat rate, taking <i><b>no commission</b></i> on sales, and will offer quality classes for low rates to people of all ages and skill levels. By working with theTRAC, recent MFA graduates will be able to continue 
the practice of teaching, gaining experience, and padding their resumes,
 making them more eligible in the teaching pool for any job they set 
their sights on. Classes at theTRAC will be offered at much lower prices, and taught by the highly 
trained MFAs, their lessons still fresh in their minds. These classes 
will also open up the opportunity for the MFAs to teach on every level, across disciplines, allowing them to become more skilled at teaching higher level classes, in addition to the introductory basics.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/efnu.nirwana"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a>
<p>Hello good
people..</p>
<p>First, let
me introduce myself: I am Efnu Nirwana, an artist  and musician living and
working in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. In December 2014, I traveled to Leipzig,
Germany for an independent artist residency and solo exhibition with Gap|Gap
Offspace. Now I have been invited to Leipzig once again for an independent
artist residency at KONTOR 80 (Torgauer Str. 80) which is an artist-run,
non-commercial gallery and multidisciplinary artist collective. <br/></p>
<p>This
opportunity would provide me with the chance to continue an art-cultural
exchange with the local artists and community that has already been started
from my last residency.</p>
<p>To be back
in Leipzig is like coming back to my second home. However, it will also mean
that I will be living in another country for 3 months, working and living in a
different atmosphere which is also what makes me excited.</p>
<p>This project isn't my project at all but ours. I just an artist who is operate it for you. <br/></p>
<p><span>This project will held on July 2016</span>
in KONTOR 80  and it will be a manual woodcut print performance, inviting community
participants to use their imagination to visualize their real world from their
own life experiences. <br/></p>
<p>The participants will draw and cut together on one big piece
of wood or linoleum, arranged in a circle. They will then manually print the
woodcut on fabric or paper, “dancing” together on the woodcut to imitate a
modern print-machine. Once finished, they will be able to display the print in
their community as an invitation to continue the discussion of their shared
humanity.</p>
<p>I quoted <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_H._Turner"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jonathan H. Turner</a>  ''<i>Cultural clashes is a conflict caused by
""differences in culture values and beliefs</i><i> that place people at odds with one another</i>"". <br/></p>
<p>
My aim is to provide a medium through which people from different backgrounds
can bridge socio-economic, racial, cultural and gender gaps. By working
together on one piece of art, participants will have an opportunity to share
ideas about humanity, peace and equality. Breaking down barriers of language,
race, and ethnicity to create as one community develops unity and fosters
understanding amongst all, to <b>cut the border</b>! And most of all, making art is always FUN to celebrate the diversity!<br/></p>
<p>SHARING is
CARING is the general idea behind this project, so I would like to ask for your
contribution in helping make this project happen.<br/></p>

Hello good
people..
First, let
me introduce myself: I am Efnu Nirwana, an artist  and musician living and
working in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. In December 2014, I traveled to Leipzig,
Germany for an independent artist residency and solo exhibition with Gap|Gap
Offspace. Now I have been invited to Leipzig once again for an independent
artist residency at KONTOR 80 (Torgauer Str. 80) which is an artist-run,
non-commercial gallery and multidisciplinary artist collective. 
This
opportunity would provide me with the chance to continue an art-cultural
exchange with the local artists and community that has already been started
from my last residency.
To be back
in Leipzig is like coming back to my second home. However, it will also mean
that I will be living in another country for 3 months, working and living in a
different atmosphere which is also what makes me excited.
This project isn't my project at all but ours. I just an artist who is operate it for you. 
This project will held on July 2016
in KONTOR 80  and it will be a manual woodcut print performance, inviting community
participants to use their imagination to visualize their real world from their
own life experiences. 
The participants will draw and cut together on one big piece
of wood or linoleum, arranged in a circle. They will then manually print the
woodcut on fabric or paper, “dancing” together on the woodcut to imitate a
modern print-machine. Once finished, they will be able to display the print in
their community as an invitation to continue the discussion of their shared
humanity.
I quoted Jonathan H. Turner  ''Cultural clashes is a conflict caused by
""differences in culture values and beliefs that place people at odds with one another"". 

My aim is to provide a medium through which people from different backgrounds
can bridge socio-economic, racial, cultural and gender gaps. By working
together on one piece of art, participants will have an opportunity to share
ideas about humanity, peace and equality. Breaking down barriers of language,
race, and ethnicity to create as one community develops unity and fosters
understanding amongst all, to cut the border! And most of all, making art is always FUN to celebrate the diversity!
SHARING is
CARING is the general idea behind this project, so I would like to ask for your
contribution in helping make this project happen.

<p style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Perhaps inevitably we eventually settled on the most iconic modern equivalent to, as well as the antithesis of the Cadillac -- the Tesla.  We approached Ant Farm with our idea and they gave us permission to create an installation based on Cadillac Ranch.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_Farm_(group)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Thank-you Ant Farm! </a> </p>

In the beginning:

We hatched a plan to create an installation on the Playa based on the proposition:  What if the Cadillacs of the iconic art installation Cadillac Ranch, ten Cadillacs buried nose down by Ant Farm in Texas in 1974, re-emerged, nose up on the Playa at Burning Man?  

And what if the Cadillacs had been transformed into zero-emissions vehicles? 


""Where the idea was born... Burning Man 2015""

We brainstormed in camp at Burning Man in 2015, then made many drawings of a variety of hybrids and e-vehicles, like these..



Perhaps inevitably we eventually settled on the most iconic modern equivalent to, as well as the antithesis of the Cadillac -- the Tesla.  We approached Ant Farm with our idea and they gave us permission to create an installation based on Cadillac Ranch.  Thank-you Ant Farm!  
And, to challenge ourselves to get our act together, we applied for sponsorship from Burning Man Arts.  Burning Man Arts have offered us a $5,000 grant towards our expenses. 


Thank you Burning Man!  Now we’re really stoked about getting done in time, with all the help we can muster from you, the rest of our friends.
Story so far:
So, imagine that the ten gas-guzzling, gross-polluting Cadillacs of “Cadillac Ranch” have burrowed through the earth and are re- emerging as zero-emissions vehicles from the Playa.  
It would look something like this:

That’s if we had about $250,000 to build it.  And we will one day, although not in time for BM 2016.  So, more modestly, we will invoke the same concept with one, or if we can reach our stretch goal ten replicas, looking something like this:


So what is our goal ? 
Because of Burning Man and our friends we will build at least 
ONE LIGHT VERSION REPLICA ELECTRIC VEHICLE















We want to build a Premium one

You are able to climb into! 





Of course with some kids and more modification !



Of course we need lights (Safety first)






So what's Next ? 



We ourselves are committed to giving as much as we can.
Our budget includes only expenses that are 100%
directly attributable to the actual cost of the installation itself.


Our artists, engineers and crew pay for
their transportation costs (in many cases from Germany) and personal supplies
(food, camping equipment, etc.).



And many Burner friends are making generous in-kind
donations.




""If our calculations are
      correct ... when this project hits his goal ....you're gonna see some
      serious......"" 








 GOAL: SINGLE REPLICA ELECTRIC VEHICLE








GOAL = $16,500





You will get our time and our effort to make this project happen

Digital goods 
Our Sticker


“Playing with Fire” (“Jugando con fuego”) DVD 
A must-have for serious Burners and supporters:  lead-artist Keith Muscutt’s documentary explores the tradition of making art with fireworks in Peru.  Rural pirotecnicos grind gunpowder in their kitchens, make towering fire sculptures and blow everything up — including their factory with the filmmakers in it! Watch the trailer (“here”).  Plus the stickers and patches.

Champagne  reception
Artists champagne reception with a sundown tour of playa art on the mutant-vehicle Joyism (weather permitting), Thurs. Sept. 1st., 5:00 PM at Two-Lanterns Camp. Limit 10.” 


An exclusive Comic - 
Storyboard of our tale... Drawings by Pawel Pietkun 
Artist / architect and animator Pawel Pietkun (Link) is creating a storyboard in color of the conception and realization of the installation. It will be a lavish limited-edition of 50, signed by the artist for collectors. And of course you get the sticker and patch too.




3D Model of our Art Work
A fully assembled, laser-cut 3D model of the installation, true to the original, scaled down using the original CAD files. A collector’s numbered, limited-edition of ten, discreetly inscribed with the artists' signatures (just cover these up and you can pretend you made it yourself). Plus the 3D data files (creative commons copyright)





Last but not least ! 



Save the clock tower ... ehh. Save this piece of Art ! Every year at Thanksgiving the President of the United States pardons the White House Turkey, instead of cooking it.  In that same spirit of sacred giving we offer as the highest level of reward a reprieve for our installation.  
FOR A CONTRIBUTION OF $5,000 WE WILL PARDON ONE ELECTRIC VEHICLE REPLICA AND REFRAIN FROM BURNING IT ON THE PLAYA.  At your request, we will transfer ownership to you and deliver it, as is, to any location in the continental United States for the reasonable and necessary costs of transportation from Black Rock City.  
Preserve it as a priceless Art-e-fact, or burn the sucker – that’s up to you.

<br/><h3>WHO IS MAKING THIS HAPPEN?<br/>
</h3>
<p>The Temple of Unitea crew is a seasoned team of 28+ long-time builders, burners, camp leads, project artists, engineers and imagineers.  We have several other Burning Man projects under our belts, including the Souk during Carvansarary, Wooden Nickle Carnival, DickyBox, Portal 11, and others I am forgetting.  We have done Bubble tea at Burning Man for 10 yrs and have thrown several steampunk high teas in a 37ft covered dome.  We know how to do tea and we know how to build for the desert and how to not piss off DPW.</p>
<p>We are inviting Tea experts from all over the world to come and teach classes and perform ceremonies.  We wanted to make it easier for people from around the world to parTeacipate by sharing their tea ceremonies with the communiTea.<br/></p>
<h3>WHY?</h3>
<p>Cause we wanted to create a space for Tea Artists to perform.  A place where people from all over the world could come a share a secular ritual that both calms and stimulates conversation.  We wanted to gather people from all over the playa to enjoy this space and enjoy the adventure of taking our Tea on the road.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Budget</h3>
<p>We have the budget for this year and we have the budget for 2017 on a google spreadsheet! As you can see we had to scale it back.  If you help us with the funding now you will allow us to NOT burn out and stretch our budgets too far so we can continue to strive toward the SUPER BIG goal for next year.   Otherwise, we can still do it, it will just be pretty tough and we won't be able to afford as much tea or biscuits (and I know you want biscuits). <br/></p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>So we have some awesome perks!</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Unitea Stickers - $10</b></p>
<p>Support us just a little - you'll be tea-rific to us forever.  They are nice vinyl ones of our sepia and black logo. <br/><b></b></p>
<p><b>Tea Lip balm + 2 Matcha Moisturizing Bars - $35</b></p>Multi-purpose
 moisturizing bar made with beeswax, shea, butter, cocoa butter, 
essential oils, and matcha green tea - the ultimate cure for playa foot!<p></p>
<b></b><p><b>Unitea T-Shirt + Sticker - $45</b></p>
<p><b>Tea Cup Sets - $65</b></p>
<p>Ceramic cups burned with the symbol of the Temple of Unitea Made just for us by our Mistress of TeaCups!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Wet and White Partea VIP - $25</b></p>Come join us for a day of waterslide fun, DJs, and drinks (July 30th) if you are in Austin, Texas! <br/><br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1820670164829074/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wet and White Fundraiser Party on Facebook</a><br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>At The Temple of Unitea we will make Tea for all in a sacred space that provides a peaceful respite from the chaos of Burning Man. Unitea is not just about serving drinks; it is about full parTea-cipation and growing a communitea of Tea drinkers. Take Tea, Make Tea, and ParTeacipate in the art that surrounds you. </div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<span>While it's true we've had to scale back (for THIS year!) because our kickstarter didn't make it, we're still determined to bring super tea service to Burning Man for 2016. Community! Tea Classes! Biscuits! Conversation! Roaming tea service! But YOUR contributions will let us make it so much nicer: more tea! better biscuits! Tiny Sandwiches! Check out our grand plans, and join us to really rock it in 2017!</span><br/>
</div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Please Share on all forms of social media.  Get your friends to share as well.  Also consider just giving a few dollars for a sticker.  We will be doing a much much larger tea temple next year (we are working on it now - check out the website).  And getting stickers will get you on our list!<br/>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who Am I?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I am a freelance illustrator from Toronto, Ontario, now based in Chicoutimi, Québec. I studied illustration at OCADU in Toronto, and graduated in 2013 with a Bachelor of Design. During my studies, I had a difficult time figuring out what inspired me. Overtime, I came to realize that nature and children's art were two of the most influential sources of inspiration for myself.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Ever since my graduation almost 3 years ago, I have come to discover that being an illustrator is a very precarious job, but that hasn't stopped me from pursuing my passion, or from looking for ways that I can develop my illustrations into marketable products that people will enjoy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Now that I live in Chicoutimi, I have had the chance to be exposed to a different environment from that of Toronto. Chicoutimi is much closer to nature, surrounded by parks, and other beautiful villages and cities are only a few hours away.

<h2><b>The Nitty Gritty </b></h2>
<p>• Diane Da Costa, a celebrity stylist and curly hair expert, has been glamorizing women for the past 30 years. She is the author of the book Textured Tresses and the founder of the Harlem CurlyTexturedBAR (Harlem CtBAR), which will open in 2018. </p>
<p>• Previously Diane opened the first multi-textured Aveda concept salon in Manhattan and she currently owns her own salon, SimpleeBEAUTIFUL CurlyTexturedBAR in Westchester, New York.</p>
<p>• As a curly, textured hair expert, Diane is all about beautifying, educating and styling curly, textured hair. Over the years, Diane has created a community where women with wavy, curly and coily hair can embrace their natural beauty, exchange meaningful conversations and purchase botanical hair products. </p>
<p>• The Harlem CtBAR will offer a beauty lounge for consultations, coloring, cuts, new hair technology, hair extensions, treatments, express blow-outs and textured styling.</p>
<p>• In a fast-paced society, having access to a one-stop-shop that also sells high-end botanical hair products is an important option for women to experience. The Harlem CtBAR will provide curly girls with a place to chill, commune and get pampered, while purchasing beauty products, hair accessories and tools designed for women with multi-textured hair. </p>
<p>• The Harlem CtBAR will bring much needed beauty services, specifically for natural and curly women to Harlem!</p>
<p>• The salon will also educate young, talented people from the community who want to acquire a natural hair specialist &amp; advanced training in cutting and styling curly, textured hair.</p>
<h2> </h2>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>▪ A total of $5,000 is needed to fund this campaign. Contributions will be used to provide training for staff so that they can service all of our guests in the most efficient way, plus training specifically for blow-outs, textured styling, color and cutting techniques.</p>
<p>• Our unique perks include makeover packages executed by Diane Da Costa, a limited-edition, DYAKIM Textured Turban towel (the best quickdry microfiber hair towel on the market), and VIP entrance to the exclusive fundraising party for the CurlyTexturedBAR!</p>
<p>• All funds will be used to train coordinators, administrative staff and stylists.</p>
<p>• In addition, a portion of the proceeds raised from this crowd funding campaign will be donated to Diane’s favorite charity, The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While there are several blow-dry bars throughout Manhattan, the Harlem CtBAR will be the first and only salon offering blow-outs, ceramic and textured styling in Harlem specifically for wavy, curly and coily hair textures. Harlem women will now be able to get the best luxury and express services that are offered to the rest of New York in a fun and sexy environment. Guests will also be able to relax with and have a cocktail in hand! Those who require “express service” will be serviced within 90 minutes. Your contribution will provide invaluable training to staff and employees who are predominately from our community.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Harlem CtBAR is scheduled to open this summer 2018, but construction can be unpredictable. All rewards will be honored when the salon opens.</p>

While there are several blow-dry bars throughout Manhattan, the Harlem CtBAR will be the first and only salon offering blow-outs, ceramic and textured styling in Harlem specifically for wavy, curly and coily hair textures. Harlem women will now be able to get the best luxury and express services that are offered to the rest of New York in a fun and sexy environment. Guests will also be able to relax with and have a cocktail in hand! Those who require “express service” will be serviced within 90 minutes. Your contribution will provide invaluable training to staff and employees who are predominately from our community.
 

Risks & Challenges
The Harlem CtBAR is scheduled to open this summer 2018, but construction can be unpredictable. All rewards will be honored when the salon opens.

<p>ShineOnGifts shops was officially founded in January 2017 though it has been brewing on the back burner for several years. I cannot let go of this dream to start the first of a chain of gift shops which will feature local quality hand made gifts made by individuals.</p>
<p>I have been in commission sales for the past 16 years and prior to that, I started a successful service business which grew to 3 shifts and multiple contractual clients. I operated this business, Shine On Janitorial Svc.  for 7 years.  Though it provided exceptional service to businesses and residential clients,  paid the bills and provided income to others, it was not my main passion.  </p>
<p>I envision Shine On Gifts being an asset in local communities as I plan on going out in local under served neighborhoods and setting up volunteer children workshops during after school hours 3:00-6:00 when the children are out of school but the parents are not home from work. We can teach the kids jewelry, ornament,  stuffed animals and pillow making and various crafts that they can sell in the ""Kids Corner"" of our shops. This will provide them with an allowance that they may not otherwise be able to earn.</p>
<p>Let's face it, online sellers like Amazon and Etsy are easy to get lost in.  They lack the personal touch, the hands on face to face contact that a creative shop experience provides. Not the usual stuffy corporate scripted sales pitch but a very user friendly and classy shopping experience.  Did I mention supporting local musicians as well? Yes, I'll hire guitar, flute, and piano players to provide background music for the shoppers to enjoy during special events and busy holiday shopping hours!</p>
<p>After the first year, I envision the shop being self sufficient and able to grow in other communities. After all, it is a shop for everyone! Here's where the initial funding donations will go:</p>
<p>$25,000  One year lease approx. 1500 sq ft retail space in an Atlanta Strip Mall</p>
<p>  15,000    6 months mixed media marketing &amp; advertising</p>
<p>    4,000    Insurance, permits, licensing and signs for the shop</p>
<p>     3,000    Initial inventory for the shop</p>
<p>      3,000   Shop shelving, tables &amp; supplies</p>
<p>$50,000 Total start up costs</p>
<p> What you get is a chance to support starting a business that ultimately will come full circle back to you!  If you or someone you know make things, I'd love to sell those things! If you like supporting your local community, this is a great idea for that!  Shine On Gifts is about reaching out to our individual creative roots and developing passion for other's unique creations. Another concrete platform to sell what our own hands produced and shop for special goods created within our communities!</p>
<p>This is the part where I am to describe where the funds will go if I do not reach my goal. This seems like a negative thought to me. I will use the funds to build ShineOnGifts until my goal is met. </p>
<p>Your contribution will be valued whether it's $3.00 or $10,000.  Every dollar will count in getting the door open.  I know you all have more than money to contribute once the doors are open, the lights are on and we are setting up the shop. I want to support your ideas, too! We will be in partnership to have fun in our communities and Shine On Together!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>I have been thinking about the right time and method to start this business.  The risk and challenge is generating enough interest in the local community to keep the business developing and growing. I want to dedicate most of my time doing this as I believe it can be done.  I need to get the idea out where others can see it, experience and enjoy it.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Consider the Lilies is the first Off-Broadway production by House Red Theatre Company. the New York stage giant Austin Pendleton chose to be involved after a table-reading in an apartment on the Upper West Side in the spring of 2013. From there the team had a formal play reading at the Mint Theatre in the fall of 2013. For the next three years the team searched for funding to bring this dream to life. This is going to be a first Off-Broadway production for many involved, so the excitement is high.</p>
<p>We are seeking funds to publicize the production and market to audiences so they will see this event. We plan to advertise in all the major New York publications to get reviews, which could further interest in the production.</p>
<ul><li>With the assistance from you good people on IndieGogo we will be able to reach out to the major publications for advertising. Without the advertising and reviews, this production could sink into oblivion without anyone knowing about us, knowing about the original play, Austin's efforts on stage, the supporting casts' efforts, the hard work from designers and builders. The list is long. So many people will be working to put this on, but without your support we could have empty houses. Competition is thick in New York.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are seeking $12,500 to get the word out. We have a great publicist ready to roll, but we need your support so she can do her job. She's extremely prepared and has excellent experience, we're just lacking funds to set her free to work.</li>
<li>If we can't reach our goal, whatever funding we do get will still go to publicity. Without an audience we have nothing, but hard working artists playing to empty seats. Meaning all other funds we've raised will be spent with no hope of moving forward.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Without your help the production's World Premiere will be only be a workshop of sorts. </li>
<li>House Red has been productin theatre since 2000 in Atlanta, Minneapolis and Los Angeles. This is our first production in New York City. We want to give the audiences a memorable experience, one that could spark us on to our next venture. Your support will allow us to reach people and help us continue on in a highly competitive city.</li>
<li>Make it real for people and build trust.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>The risk is high for us because of this being our first production Off-Broadway. This could either make us or break us-literally.</li>
<li>We have a smart and talented and experience team to see this project through despite the possible short comings of funds. We will not stop no matter what we receive in funding here. It will be four years by the time we open. That committment is outstanding and we want the team to reep what they've sown. We risk having little to no viewers without your help, which could be devastating to our cause.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you can't offer funds, you can offer your time by spreading the word on social media. That is great publicity too!</li>
<li>by using Indiegogo share tools you can get the word out about us. That could bring possible contributors to our campaign.</li>
<li>Please come on board and help us bring this play to Off-Broadway with a stage star who loves the script and wants to give us a boost.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We need your help to bring this project to it's final stages. Projects about sex work made <i>by</i> sex workers are<strong> not traditionally funded.</strong> We have been turned town by several funders, citing that this project <i>""conflicts with our mission and values.""</i> We are committed to creating spaces for sex workers to disseminate their own knowledge, stories and art. We are now turning to our communities and social circles to help make this happen. We hope that when <i>We're Still Working  project</i> <i> </i>is a wild success, this will show more traditional funders that <strong>supporting sex workers is a necessary an important community investment. </strong></p>
<p>Sex work has a long and beautiful history of <strong>fighting for justice, visibility and respect, </strong>while working in solidarity with other movements of our time. Sex workers have played an important role in shaping the world we live in today - from Stonewall in New York to the Compton Cafeteria uprising in the Tenderloin here in San Francisco. However, the sex worker is often distorted or erased in the final accounts of their histories by news media, cinema and history books. This project <strong>recognizes workers and our intersecting communities as an important part of the San Francisco Bay Area,</strong> and honors sexual labor as an integral part of its history and artistic legacy. This visual art exhibit provides a platform for the brush, the camera, the mic, the sequins and sweat to insist that <strong>sex work is not only work, but also can be art. </strong>This visual art exhibition was recently awarded a <strong>Curatorial Residency at <a href=""http://www.somarts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SOMArts Cultural Center</a> </strong>in San Francisco. The exhibition will be on view in SOMArts’ Main Gallery from January 26–February 25, 2017. </p>
<p>We strongly believe that placing sex workers at the center of our own narrative is one of the best ways to <strong>fight for sex worker justice.</strong> We have partnered with the <strong><a href=""http://stjamesinfirmary.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">St. James Infirmary</a>, <a href=""http://ellaparatranslatinas.yolasite.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">El/La Para Trans Latinas</a>, and <a href=""http://lyric.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LYRIC LGBTQ Youth Center</a></strong> to bring you a gallery full of brilliant, impactful artwork made by sex workers. Our goal is to addresses the complexities of sex work in a way that does not further perpetuate negative stereotypes, damaging rhetoric, the over-glamorization or simplification of the trade. We are not outsiders examining the sex worker community, but insiders with art to share. <strong>Art is a form of activism,</strong> and we are committed to creating this opportunity for sex workers to share our stories through artistic outlets at SOMArts Main Gallery this January.</p>

That was accomplished with vision, the same type of vision that we, here at The Independence Day Project have for our community! </p><p>This project is needed because it will be the first to give a clear and transparent view of what an independent Black Community is supposed to resemble when the purposely placed obstacles have been removed! </p><p>We have had successful Black Communities in the past but they were not connected and they could not protect themselves from the angry mobs that eventually destroyed them and removed them from the history books. We are looking to spark the thought processes and bring the realization of institution building and self-assurance by presenting a visual that will make a clear understanding of an independent community that breeds a proactive spirit yearning to be free! </p><p>We have been apart of several successful projects in the past whether it be back to school drives or presenting needy families with food and clothes within the community. Just last year What About Us? put together a book reading initiative that raised monies to sponsor children who read books while on summer vacation. The point is, when we are committed we follow through and we are sincerely committed to this project!</p><p>So, you must be asking yourselves, who is this Professor Carl Tone Jones and this What About Us? Organization?</p><p>Upon obtaining his Master's Degree in Social Studies-Citizenship, Professor Carl Tone Jones worked vigorously in the Philadelphia Public School system. As a professor, he also teaches courses in the area of community leadership. An accomplished lecturer, writer and public speaker, Jones has become a beacon of hope within the community as he strives to continue his focus concerning the improvement of the socio-economic conditions of the African born Americans as well as descendants of the African Diaspora. He continues to work with at-risk youths helping them to develop and utilize critical thinking skills through his workshops and lectures.</p><p>""What About Us?"" began as a workshop that I created ​to address the plight of black adolescents who were considered at-risk youths struggling to assess their social constructs as they related to morality, value structures and critical thinking. The motivation behind the workshop was due to the untimely death of a close relative at the hands of another youth here in the streets of North Philadelphia. But even before that unfortunate incident I had taken an interest in securing a role in the preservation and uplift of the black community by working with youths and teaming with like minded people to form coalitions to battle the systems of white supremacy. Hopefully, this site will become a place of strength, information sharing and strategic creation as we move forward in these challenging times.</p><p>So, How Can You Assist Us If You Do Not Have $$$?</p><p>There are a few ways in which you can assist with the project if you don't have the capability to make a monetary contribution:</p><p>You can share this crowdfund on your social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram using the Hashtag #ProjectIndependence and #BlackIndependenceorDie</p><p>You can also use the Indiegogo sharing tools as well as word of mouth advertising. </p><p>Family, </p><p>Let's work together to be a part of the project that changed to focus and the vision of the Black Liberation Movement! </p><p>Ase' Family,</p><p>Professor Carl Tone Jones, M.

That was accomplished with vision, the same type of vision that we, here at The Independence Day Project have for our community! This project is needed because it will be the first to give a clear and transparent view of what an independent Black Community is supposed to resemble when the purposely placed obstacles have been removed! We have had successful Black Communities in the past but they were not connected and they could not protect themselves from the angry mobs that eventually destroyed them and removed them from the history books. We are looking to spark the thought processes and bring the realization of institution building and self-assurance by presenting a visual that will make a clear understanding of an independent community that breeds a proactive spirit yearning to be free! We have been apart of several successful projects in the past whether it be back to school drives or presenting needy families with food and clothes within the community. Just last year What About Us? put together a book reading initiative that raised monies to sponsor children who read books while on summer vacation. The point is, when we are committed we follow through and we are sincerely committed to this project!So, you must be asking yourselves, who is this Professor Carl Tone Jones and this What About Us? Organization?Upon obtaining his Master's Degree in Social Studies-Citizenship, Professor Carl Tone Jones worked vigorously in the Philadelphia Public School system. As a professor, he also teaches courses in the area of community leadership. An accomplished lecturer, writer and public speaker, Jones has become a beacon of hope within the community as he strives to continue his focus concerning the improvement of the socio-economic conditions of the African born Americans as well as descendants of the African Diaspora. He continues to work with at-risk youths helping them to develop and utilize critical thinking skills through his workshops and lectures.""What About Us?"" began as a workshop that I created ​to address the plight of black adolescents who were considered at-risk youths struggling to assess their social constructs as they related to morality, value structures and critical thinking. The motivation behind the workshop was due to the untimely death of a close relative at the hands of another youth here in the streets of North Philadelphia. But even before that unfortunate incident I had taken an interest in securing a role in the preservation and uplift of the black community by working with youths and teaming with like minded people to form coalitions to battle the systems of white supremacy. Hopefully, this site will become a place of strength, information sharing and strategic creation as we move forward in these challenging times.So, How Can You Assist Us If You Do Not Have $$$?There are a few ways in which you can assist with the project if you don't have the capability to make a monetary contribution:You can share this crowdfund on your social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram using the Hashtag #ProjectIndependence and #BlackIndependenceorDieYou can also use the Indiegogo sharing tools as well as word of mouth advertising. Family, Let's work together to be a part of the project that changed to focus and the vision of the Black Liberation Movement! Ase' Family,Professor Carl Tone Jones, M.
