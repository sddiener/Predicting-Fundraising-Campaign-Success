It has been a remarkable few days, and amazing few last hours, for our campaign. From being close to our $800 target with a few days to go there was a sudden, unexpected but very welcome rush of support from a group of our friends and supporters.
We needed US$800 and we got US$1300!  Better than we ever hoped for.  Now, compared to all those super-sexy high tech gadget campaigns which raise $300000 in their first week, our might not seem much of an achievement, but for us it makes all the difference in the world for the first time ever Nine Dragons RPG has some real cash behind it.
So, what now?
Well first off, the campaign has become ""In Demand"". This means we can keep the campaign running and receiving backing and even use it as a sales device. So those of you who backed us during the thirty days, thank you, and we will fulfill the perks as soon as possible, and it isn't over yet!

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<h3>Shift your thinking</h3>
<p>The lessons learned and assimilated through playing <strong>Waste Not</strong> have the ability to make real change in behaviors and how we interact with the world.  By playing until the deck is mastered, players will start to shift their thinking into a way that is more sustainable.</p>
<h3>Use resources more efficiently</h3>
<p>Understandings in an office setting might look like more sustainable use of available supplies, and better ideas on how to operate without waste.  In a team of designers the game would enable them to look at the product or process they are developing with an understanding the leftover materials should be considered, to think about what will happen to what they are making at the end of its lifecycle, and to inherently be more creative with the products and processes that they employ. </p>
<h3>Get Creativity and Innovation into the hands of our Future</h3>
<p>Finally and perhaps most importantly, Waste Not can help to enable our next generation to be thinkers.  Students are our future and with their fresh take on established systems the sooner that they are looking at how to do things differently, the better.  Waste Not can build these patterns of thinking early and in a way that they stick.</p>
<p>This is the first game brought to market, but not the first designed to completion.  The first, Common Cents, was designed to teach why buying local matters in a playshop (workshop simulation) format.  Because of its more limited audience the choice to wait to make it more widely available became clear. In addition to Common Cents, Kirsten also regularly works with organizations to design games and playful experiences.</p>
<p>Having this campaign funded would not only allow Waste Not to be brought into the world to create positive action, it would also serve to provide Kirsten the opportunity to work on and bring to life the next of the 10+ other ideas that she has for games on sustainability.</p>

</div></div>","What are you going to do with it?  
Game Designer, Kirsten Bonanza, created Waste Not because it drives her crazy to have to throw things away.  The game itself as a way to explain the possible options available when an object is no longer good for its inital use. The core question of the game - What are you going to do with it? - challenges players to rethink trash as potential and resources.  Waste Not is being made available as a card game for in person play and as an online game.


1-100 players


Ages 12 - 120 (Can be played with younger if an adult helps)


For Classrooms, Community Groups, Businesses going green, Designers, & Families


Kirsten's background is in teaching, facilitating, and consulting.  Her interest in design lies in educating for sustainability and systems thinking.  She also believes that we will achieve a sustainable future more easily by giving people the experience of how a large system (Earth) works in a playful environment.

<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Website Designers</b> - $184,800 we will look to have complete integration throughout the server and the sites (Ranks, money, quests) and for this we will use our coders and employ website designers that specialise in Minecraft server integration with Wordpress.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Dedicated Server Hosting</b> - $199,500 will allow us to get a dedicated server for hosting (12 months)</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Veterans Server</b> - $214,000 we can introduce the MinecraftBuddy Seniors &amp; Vets Server.  One of our Grandparents on the site, <i>Agnak12</i> is leading the introduction of a MinecraftBuddy concept for<b> Seniors (over 60) </b>and<b> war veterans</b>.

</div></div>","We know that there are literally tens of thousands of kids around the world that really want to play with other kids online, in a multiplayer environment.If you have seen what goes on in most of these Minecraft Servers you will know that there is profound and profuse swearing, bullying (often called griefing) and 'raging'.  We have developed MinecraftBuddy to ensure that the playing environment is safe, infact, it is moderated by teachers and vetted adults to make sure that if a kid does need help, there is someone there to guide them, or referee a problem.MinecraftBuddy is a Minecraft Server that allows children to play in survival or creative mode, to play minigames, complete challenges and quests and enter competitions.  It is a 'whitelisted' server, meaning that only those players that meet our requirements can join. Because the server is whitelisted we have a very small membership (around 400). We know that kids want to play with other kids.Kids want to play with other kids, that is the whole idea of playing online.  The problem we have encountered is that because we are whitelisted, there are often no kids on the server.- and when there are no kids on the server, no one else wants to play there either; so we are experiencing a vicious circle: people sign up, the kids see only a few others playing, and soon stop playing on our server, and parents cancel their subscription.  We believe in this concept, of having a safe place for kids to play their favourite game.We also think that is is possible to offer this service to families for free, and ultimately, that's what we want to do.We had an awesome Admin on the server called Simplimazing and while she was a full time admin the number of kids on the server at any one time was increasing.  Our money ran out, and we could no longer afford to pay Simp, and our numbers dropped as soon as she left.So, we want to pay Simp a full time wage for 12 months, and pay for the server to be hosted while we make our improvements and set the server up to be the very best 'kid safe server' we can.As you can see, we have stretch goals that will improve the server beyond belief, as explained below.The main reason we want to have Simp as a full time admin is that she keeps the server safe.  She also makes it fun and engaging too.  Some of the really cool stuff Simp did as a full time admin was:

 to help shy kids to make friends

 work effectively with kids on the spectrum (ASD - autism spectrum disorder),  helping them to build their ability to communicate through the 'chat' function
 communicate with parents to resolve issues
 create displays for the website and the Facebook page to keep players and  families informed about cool stuff that was happening on the server
 Develop and manage treasure hunts
 Make continual improvements, including fixing and creating mini games
 Encourage players to be creative and have fun
As our numbers grow we will look to add a second paid Admin, but for now we have some awesome volunteers that have been helping to make MinecraftBuddy a safe place to play.Originally we set up a subscription model to help pay for the server, with the idea of increasing subscriptions giving us the scope to further develop and improve the MinecraftBuddy concept.The subscriptions haven't helped to keep MinecraftBuddy up and running.  We decided to follow the example many other successful servers have developed, and will create BuddyVerse, a minigames server that will generate the income needed to keep MinecraftBuddy running.  The donations received through Indiegogo will help us sustain MinecraftBuddy for 12 months, and if we can hit some of our stretch goals, we can set the server up to be FREE for the future.MinecraftBuddy is a vast server, and needs constant maintenance.  This is one of the important reasons we need a full time Admin.  We are always getting great ideas from our player group to improve MinecraftBuddy, and while Simplimazing was a full time Admin, some of those ideas came to life.  With Simp as the Admin again, and with some of our stretch goals being reached, we can continue to improve MinecraftBuddy.  Some of our goals for continual improvement are:
Customising the current website at http://minecraftbuddy.co and moving it to minecraftbuddy.com
Developing tutorials and in-game challenges for those that are new to Minecraft or have a learning difficulty
Developing and improving the http://minecraftchallenges.com website, then integrating the quests and challenges on the server, so that challenges and quest completion are recorded on the challenges website.  Linking Ranks to completion of quests or challenge sequences
Further developing academic challenges for the minecraftchallenges.com website.  Linking Google Apps For Education as part of the challenge process
We tried to make this a user pays server, and although it seemed like a good idea, it doesn't promote its continual growth.  We are now asking for donations and the way we will use them are as follows, we will pay for:
The server hosting
Simp's Admin wage for 12 months.  As soon as we have 3 months wages donated Simp will join the server and our plans can begin to see fruit.
Once we have 12 months of Simp's wages and 12 months of server hosting, we will declare the server free to join.
We will continue to develop the server as donations come in, which is clearly stated in the next section, the budget.The rewards will also be explained in more detail below, though it can be noted that we will deliver all digital rewards within 7 days.  Anything that needs packing and posting will depend upon where you are from; be assured that we will send things off as soon as we can.  We will be encouraging you to take a picture of your rewards and post them through social media.Our initial goal, that of sustaining a safe Minecraft server for kids to play, is $28,368. This in itself is a large sum of money.  You have probably already noticed that our stretch goals go well beyond this?  As is stated in the next section we have grand dreams of what MinecraftBuddy can be.  Through conversations with parents and educators the world over, we are convinced that this is a service that is needed, not just for 'mainstream' kids, kids on the ASD spectrum, and children with learning difficulties, but also for seniors, war veterans and people that have suffered PTSD.  We also believe that this will develop into a very handy and much needed teaching tool.How the money will be spent, initially, is quite simple.Goal: $28,368Fees: $2,128Server Hosting: $480Admin Wage: $20,800Rewards:$5,000The rewards will seem a high percentage (about 25%), but keep in mind that the high end rewards are Minecraft Camps anywhere in the world.  These Camps are not cheap to run locally, so if we are offered the opportunity to hold them throughout the world, we need to make sure we have priced our goals and perks accordingly.We will continue to report on our MinecraftBuddy accomplishments, and will post photos, videos and artwork of the project as we go.Once we have MinecraftBuddy as a sustainable server (hosting and Simp's wage) we will look at improvement.  As explained in the budget above, these stretch goals have financial figures attached and each goal will help MinecraftBuddy to grow.
Freedom - $28,368 MinecraftBuddy is FREE 
Master Coder - $72600 we can employ the Master Coder - Tsugaga - 12 months
Coder Buddy - $86,900 To speed up the process, and add detail to the planned improvements, a second coder will be employed (part time).
2nd Admin - $114,400 we will secure a second Administrator for the server.  We will look to have our 2nd admin in another timezome, allowing us to cover more hours in the day.
Coders 3 & 4 - $143,000 to continue to improve and maintain the MinecraftBuddy and Buddyverse servers we will bring in 2 more coders.
Website Designers - $184,800 we will look to have complete integration throughout the server and the sites (Ranks, money, quests) and for this we will use our coders and employ website designers that specialise in Minecraft server integration with Wordpress.
Dedicated Server Hosting - $199,500 will allow us to get a dedicated server for hosting (12 months)
Veterans Server - $214,000 we can introduce the MinecraftBuddy Seniors & Vets Server.  One of our Grandparents on the site, Agnak12 is leading the introduction of a MinecraftBuddy concept for Seniors (over 60) and war veterans. As we pursue this we are looking to develop the server with neuro linguistic aspects to help keep veterans and the elderly 'sharp' of mind.

Multinational Multi Servers - $242,400 will allow 4 x Dedicated multinational servers.  As MinecraftBuddy grows across all continents, we will need to have our hosting dedicated, and close to our players.

<p>We are the indie developers Broken Rules, creators of And Yet It Moves. <br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Secrets of Rætikon is our third and most ambitious project; an open world action-adventure with a focus on exploration. Secrets of Rætikon will launch on </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Windows, Mac and Linux</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">.</span></p>
<p>Development started with a dream about flying. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">One day, Felix came into the office and told us about a dream he had, and we started sharing stories about how each of us flies in dreams. It turned out we all love those dreams. So we decided to make this game, a game where you swoop over hills and mountains, as in a dream.</span></p>
<p>The world of Secrets of Rætikon is richly populated with robins, lynx, jackdaws, stag, foxes, rabbits, buzzards, bats and more to come. Throughout the Alps, you find remnants of an ancient civilization. Some of the secrets of the Rætikon are hidden behind their fantastic contraptions - strange machines that you'll activate to progress through the game. A world made of triangles invites you to become part of the enduring struggle between nature and civilization.</p>

<p>We've been working on Secrets of Rætikon for more than two years, and now <b>the alpha is ready for you to play</b>.</p>
<p>If you support this campaign, we will send you a copy of the game as soon as Indiegogo has processed your order. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Be aware that we have to send out the keys by hand, so it might take us a few days.</span></p>
<p>Like any good alpha, things can sometimes go haywire in the game. Fortunately, most of the time it's great fun when they do! Things we've seen happen recently include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rabbits getting catapulted into the sky.</li>
<li>A stag got bitten by a lynx, then blithely dragged it through half the level before meeting an untimely end.</li>
<li>Sporadic cases of rabbit necrophilia</li>
<li>... and odd game crashes. Those are not as fun, though.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>We need your help to finish the game because we are running out of funds!</b> </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We want to finish the game with YOU instead of turning to a publisher. In return, we open our development. By 'open' we mean that we will share our assets and tools that we use to create the game. That includes the level editor which is already included in the first tier.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>We plan to ship the finished game in the first quarter of 2014 if we are successful in funding the rest of the development. That's where you come into play!</b></span></p>

<p></p>
<p>Fortunately we've received a government grant for Secrets of Rætikon<i> </i>that carried us this far. The grant was for a series of games based in the Alps. Secrets of Rætikon is the second game in this series, following Chasing Aurora, our multiplayer game that launched on the Wii U. The rest of the Rætikon development was funded with the revenue of And Yet It Moves and our private money.</p>
<p>We need to continue working on the game for at least two months, cover our license fees, and promote the game at a number of game festivals. We're based in Europe, so traveling to the United States, where most of those festivals take place, costs quite a bit of money.</p>
<p>Most of the funding we receive through this campaign goes directly into game development. A small fraction goes to Indiegogo for hosting the campaign. And of course we need to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of the physical rewards.</p>
<p>There is still a lot of content to be added to the game and we want to be able to take the time to give the game the amount of polish deserves. Also we need to feed ourselves and our families.</p>

<p>Broken Rules started out as a student project in 2006. The initial team, consisting of Felix, Jan and Peter, met at a game design course at Vienna’s Technical University. During that course we made And Yet It Moves. When we won the Student Award at the Independent Games Festival 2007 we decided to turn the prototype into a real game. Two years later, we founded Broken Rules and released And Yet It Moves on Steam and the Nintendo Wii. At that time, Clemens and Martin joined the team. Together, we started working on Chasing Aurora which we released as a launch title for the Nintendo Wii U.</p>

This game is in active development. Support us by joining the Open Alpha of Secrets of Rætikon. We are developing this game while you are reading this and we will update the game nearly every week. Within a day, you get a copy of the game if you support this campaign. It's full of surprises, bugs and missing features, but Secrets of Rætikon already looks and plays beautiful. Watch us create a world brimming with life and full of stories.

      

We are the indie developers Broken Rules, creators of And Yet It Moves. Secrets of Rætikon is our third and most ambitious project; an open world action-adventure with a focus on exploration. Secrets of Rætikon will launch on Windows, Mac and Linux.
Development started with a dream about flying. One day, Felix came into the office and told us about a dream he had, and we started sharing stories about how each of us flies in dreams. It turned out we all love those dreams. So we decided to make this game, a game where you swoop over hills and mountains, as in a dream.
The world of Secrets of Rætikon is richly populated with robins, lynx, jackdaws, stag, foxes, rabbits, buzzards, bats and more to come. Throughout the Alps, you find remnants of an ancient civilization. Some of the secrets of the Rætikon are hidden behind their fantastic contraptions - strange machines that you'll activate to progress through the game. A world made of triangles invites you to become part of the enduring struggle between nature and civilization.

      
      




We've been working on Secrets of Rætikon for more than two years, and now the alpha is ready for you to play.
If you support this campaign, we will send you a copy of the game as soon as Indiegogo has processed your order. Be aware that we have to send out the keys by hand, so it might take us a few days.
Like any good alpha, things can sometimes go haywire in the game. Fortunately, most of the time it's great fun when they do! Things we've seen happen recently include:

Rabbits getting catapulted into the sky.
A stag got bitten by a lynx, then blithely dragged it through half the level before meeting an untimely end.
Sporadic cases of rabbit necrophilia
... and odd game crashes. Those are not as fun, though.

We need your help to finish the game because we are running out of funds! 
We want to finish the game with YOU instead of turning to a publisher. In return, we open our development. By 'open' we mean that we will share our assets and tools that we use to create the game. That includes the level editor which is already included in the first tier.
We plan to ship the finished game in the first quarter of 2014 if we are successful in funding the rest of the development. That's where you come into play!



Fortunately we've received a government grant for Secrets of Rætikon that carried us this far. The grant was for a series of games based in the Alps. Secrets of Rætikon is the second game in this series, following Chasing Aurora, our multiplayer game that launched on the Wii U. The rest of the Rætikon development was funded with the revenue of And Yet It Moves and our private money.
We need to continue working on the game for at least two months, cover our license fees, and promote the game at a number of game festivals. We're based in Europe, so traveling to the United States, where most of those festivals take place, costs quite a bit of money.
Most of the funding we receive through this campaign goes directly into game development. A small fraction goes to Indiegogo for hosting the campaign. And of course we need to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of the physical rewards.
There is still a lot of content to be added to the game and we want to be able to take the time to give the game the amount of polish deserves. Also we need to feed ourselves and our families.










Fun fact: during the production of this game and the engine, five babies were born and one more is
on its way. True story.







Broken Rules started out as a student project in 2006. The initial team, consisting of Felix, Jan and Peter, met at a game design course at Vienna’s Technical University. During that course we made And Yet It Moves. When we won the Student Award at the Independent Games Festival 2007 we decided to turn the prototype into a real game. Two years later, we founded Broken Rules and released And Yet It Moves on Steam and the Nintendo Wii. At that time, Clemens and Martin joined the team. Together, we started working on Chasing Aurora which we released as a launch title for the Nintendo Wii U.



Christof is the musical mastermind behind Secrets of Rætikon. He is a composer, zither player and rocks the bassoon. For Secrets of Rætikon, he works with all kinds of strange instruments - from wood and water to electronics - to put together a unique soundscape. 
Clemens is our pixel pusher. He's our sole artist and creates all the graphics for Secrets of Rætikon.

Felix is CEO and game designer. He programs a lot of the gameplay, A.I. and signs contracts. He coded the rabbits in the game.
Husky is our graphics programmer. He also manages the Windows and Linux versions.
Jan does our sound design and is also responsible for gameplay. He writes a lot of our A.I. and manages the Mac version of the game.
Martin runs our marketing and writes our stories. He is also responsible for the level editor and business. He talks a lot.
Peter is our lead programmer. He made the engine that the game runs on. He dreams in code.

We've cooked up special rewards for our supporters. Here's a quick overview of all the different rewards you will find in the  tiers shown above.




A copy of the game. Continuous updates throughout the alpha and beyond. Windows and Mac version available right now. Linux coming soon. Be aware that we have to send out the keys by hand, so it might take us a few days to process your order.

Steam keys on launch. As soon as we launch Secrets of Rætikon on Steam you will receive a download key.

Exclusive project updates. Whatever we add to the game – as an Indiegogo supporter you will hear about it first.



Access to the secret alpha boards. Discuss anything and everything with other players and the creators of the game.


Lay your hands on the in-game editor we're using to build Secrets of Rætikon. Make your own levels. Change the levels we've built. Create your own game.




All music tracks originally composed by our musician Christof Dienz. Digital download in FLAC, MP3 and OGG format.
Check out these samples: Isadora's Cave | Into the Wild | Hunting

Get mentioned in the credits. Your name in the credits level. On a parallax layer, because it looks cool.

There will be two options to get extra characters. In one tier, you'll receive a community-voted alternate character: after this campaign is over, we'll run a poll with everybody who has bought this tier. The character that receives most votes goes into the build. You'll be able to choose between Ruth, Solitude, Fex and Storm from Chasing Aurora.
In a higher tier, you'll get all four extra characters already included in the package.

From the 'Collectors Edition' tier on upwards, you will get an early, never publicly seen before prototype of the game featuring unique levels, bugs and hostile animals.



The Book of Rætikon is a collection of transcriptions and illustrations from the five Rætic Lore Mæsters. It is a rare item and only few printed copies remain. Luckily, modern technology allows digital reprography and now everybody can enjoy the full backstory, sketches, concept art and high resolution images.

Receive an exclusive, signed and numbered art print, created by Clemens, our artist. These prints are limited to 250.





We will send you a finely crafted cardboard box that holds a beautiful, custom branded USB stick made of wood.

You will receive a personalized wallpaper featuring your name in Rætic runes.

Your name will be carved into stone at a sacred pilgrimage site that marks the entrance to the cave of the Rætic gods. You get to choose a pilgrim's name, which will be written in Rætic runes.



The backstory is told in the game using quotes from the Book of Rætikon. The book was written by five lore masters and each quote is attributed to one of them. Together with Martin, author of the backstory, you will get to name one of the lore masters and customize the quotes in game.



Your likeness in the cave of the Rætic gods. Send us a photo of you, your dear loved one or your pet baby alligator! We will erect a statue in the cave, carrying your/his/her/its name.

You will receive a unique, hand-drawn artwork, signed by our artist Clemens.

            

All rewards except the alpha will be delivered after the game is finished!


The louder you are the more money we'll raise. The person who makes the most noise about this campaign will receive a unique gift from us: a larger-than-life fox statue made from cardboard. We’ll be awarding this statue to the individual who brings the most contributions in using Indiegogo’s sharing tools.


Just be sure to create an Indiegogo account and use their tools to earn a chance at this a one-of-a-kind reward. Use the sharing tools to shepherd the most friends and family to our campaign and the fox is yours!



Every game project has some risks attached. We have a running alpha version of the game. If you support us you get a playable build of the game as soon as we process your payment. We're a small indie studio, so a little bit of patience will be required.
This is a campaign makes it possible for us to finish the game. We can't do that without you. Please join us in the Alpha!",42.0,0,"1 Campaign

spread through the three nations as one by one members of their ruling families
began to disappear. The nations, all self-absorbed by nature, tried to resolve
the problems diplomatically, offering help and apologies to each other. However,
these messengers never reached their goals, butchered on the way. Each province
assumed that this was an act of hostility by the other – a clear admission of
guilt for the kidnappings – and the three of them joined in battle. As they
interrogated the prisoners they took that day, they realised that something was
wrong, that far from slaying their messengers, the nations they were now
fighting had been just as eager for peace as they had. But it was too late,
blood had been shed, territories seized: the victors could not let their
position of strength go and the losers wanted revenge. So the wars carried on,
even as they realised that this conflict had been orchestrated by someone else,
someone who wanted to see them weakened, someone with a terrible and
inscrutable purpose. They fought and did not relent because they did not want
to face whatever was to come when the war was over. </font></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><font color=""#6a6a6a""><b>The Kingdoms</b></font></span></p><p></p><ul><li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><b>The Carnifair</b> - a nation dominated by an artificial and gratuitous system of government.

The Weeping Land is an enormous geyser that flows for miles. Each Kingdom will have their place and will fight for dominance. No one knows where the water comes from.The Battles will be 3 heroes versus 3 heroes. Each Hero will have his own monster horde. Movement and fighting will be based on a turn based system. The Battle Map will be a hexagonal mapping system with various terrain that will include bonuses and penalties depending on the creature type in the location.The Questing System will be interactive and allow for the player to manage the choices the heroes will take while on a quest. There is some randomness included to ensure that the player gets unique experiences.Your donations are the chance to make a big splash and get into the game. Whether it's a simple donation, being in the credits, or participating in the alpha's or beta's, or getting free game currency for life, it matters.Remolding a classic is a tough job! Enhancing it and placing it on mobile devices is even harder.

<b>MAFIA THE PARTY GAME</b> is a multiplayer role-playing game centered on a battle between an informed minority and an uninformed majority. Players are secretly assigned roles in two distinct aspects: either as discreet members of the Mafia, who know each other; or Citizens who know only the number of Mafia among them. In the game's Night Phase the Mafia covertly operates to ""murder"" a Citizen. During the Day Phase, all surviving players debate the identities of the Mafia and vote to eliminate a suspect. Play continues until all of the Mafia members have been eliminated, or until the Mafia outnumbers the Citizens.<p><br/></p>

<p><b>Features</b></p>
<p>Unlike the traditional way of playing Mafia, where players must be gathered in one room and where the game can <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=012P0zOFR6Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">easily get out of hand</a>, players will be able play in organized (or optionally timed') games against each other all over the world without having to leave the comfort of their home.</p>
<p>Additionally, points accumulated during play can be used to obtain items for  protection or to heighten the stakes. Need to put a hit on someone? Or hire a private investigator to unearth the truth about your suspicions? Earned points can be used in-game to acquire these professionals.</p>

It's also geared towards providing assets for projects being developed for mobile platforms like iOS and Android. These assets are low poly, low bone count and have low texture overhead. I'll get into the nitty gritty technical details below.</p>
<p>What I'm hoping to achieve with this campaign is : Provide low cost assets to game developers for usage in their mobile projects. At the same time I am hoping to fund my own hourly work on these assets and expand the collection to include all (3) of the character sets. The sets will include a low poly zombie pack, a low poly military personnel pack, and a civilian pack. Each pack will consist of one universal model and (5) texture variations for each...this means 15 different animated characters for your game!</p>

<div>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16956434/KickstarterZombieApocalypse/WhatYouNeedBanner.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>What you will get in this campaign is direct digital delivery of (3) different character packs. These consist of the Low Poly Zombie Pack, the Low Poly Military Pack and the Low Poly Civilian Pack. Each of these packs comes with (5) texture variations and at least  (10) animations per character. Depending on the perk you choose you can choose to receive any single character set, (2) character sets or the entire (3) character pack! <strong>Don't forget the Low Poly Military Pack comes bundled with the Low Poly Weapon Pack (see below). </strong></p>
<p><strong>UPDATED - Every character pack now comes with the Low Poly Melee Weapons Bundle!</strong></p>
<p>What I need are funds to cover my hourly rate for modeling, texturing, rigging and animation of the additional assets required to complete all of the packs. I anticipate this will be 2-3 weeks of work polishing up the assets and getting them all to a final deliverable state. I anticipate 30-40 production hours to complete the pack and my funding goal fits right into that.</p>
<p><strong><em>Some technical details: </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All characters contain 16 Bones in their respective rig setups.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>The characters are setup using Biped in 3DS Max. This is important for editing or addition of new animations. I am providing the models in .max, .obj and .fbx formats. These formats are usable in a variety of game engines.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Characters are 500 quad polygons, some characters may exceed this to a ceiling of 600 quad polygons.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>All characters use either a 256x256 or 512x512 PSD texture. These textures are fully editable, contain aptly named layers and make extensive use of layer styles and color overlays (allows flexibility in customizing look further).</li>

The Axe is 100 quad polygons, the baseball bat is 120 quad polygons, the machete is 130 quad polygons, the katana sword is 65 quad polygons and the pipe wrench is 500 polygons. These assets will help you develop your mobile FPS, zombie shooter or any kind of military style game. They use 512x512 PSD textures which are also optimized for mobile purposes.


 
Some visual ideas for the Civilian Pack.
These visuals are only for clothing texture ideas and are not my own final concepts or 3d models. These are images from the work of artist tom_drin. I only include them to give a general idea of the type of look the civilians may have. The animations for the civilians will include the standard, walk, run, jump, death, being struck/hit, hiding/taking cover and two types of panic animations.


 



I think this campaign can open up a world of funding the creation of high quality assets and delivering those to people at a very low cost. This is possible due to the nature of crowdfunding. The more folks participating, the more it helps everyone!



If you can't contribute financially, please find the social sharing tools at the top of the page and share this campaign. Feel free to share this on your social networks or even better amongst the fellow game development communities.",23.0,0,"10 Campaigns

The hope is to create a platform for people to form teams, or join up with preexisting ones to have a fun, challenging, and rewarding tournament for Heroes of Newerth, a game long lacking a competitive scene.

 Leach, I live in Hamilton, New Zealand (that tiny country near the underneath everyone ) and I am currently in the progress of developing my first indie 
game in C# called Dimensia.<br/> I just completed my last year and high 
school, and am about to set off to a new city to begin my study of 
engineering at University.<br/>Dimensia has been a side hobby for the past year while finishing High School.<br/><br/>I am a co-founder of the group Kolben Games, a small independent game company which consists of young indie developers with a passion to create games. Even with being in a company, each project is worked on individually, meaning Dimensia is my own project, and the only one actively working on it.</p><p>This
 campaign is designed to help fund some cash which will make a huge 
impact of my move to University and to help fund a continued development
 on my game while partaking in full-time study.<br/>This is important to 
me, as it will allow me to put money towards a laptop to continue 
development, along with extra funds to put towards the development of 
the game. <br/></p><p>I started programming about 2 years ago, and around 6 months in I started development on my first game, Dimensia, and ever since have been working on it as a hobby along side my education. I have a desire and passion to code, especially awesome particle engines using just a pixel texture! This project started just to learn and self-teach myself C#, until I realised I could turn it somewhat into an 'okay' game.<br/><br/>The idea of the game actually came from one of my High-school friends who created a very basic prototype for a school exam, from there he wanted me to develop it into a proper game. The development has always had me as a solo-coder, and part-time artist with various friends helping me at each step for graphics. High school support is the best!<br/><br/>I have a passion to complete this game as I work through university, to both complete my first ever game, and continue to do what I enjoy, code.</p><h2>The Game</h2><p></p><p>Dimensia is a 2D platformer game with is focused around the adventure
 on a single individual and his companion henry. 
The game explores an individual and his robotic suit, testing his 
ability through multiple dimensions in a select environment. 
As you progress through the challenges, you will be presented in new 
environments which will further test you and your suits abilities, 
allowing for more complex obstacles and more advanced gameplay. </p>
<p>The storyline follows the individual , facing challenges presented by an unknown source in order to 'test' the suits abilities.
As you progress through the game, you find out more about who you are, and where you are in the face of reality.<br/><br/>The game currently is in early beta, the core game is there although needs to be added on .<br/></p>Honestly, the game itself is quite strange, may seem not 'professionally' done, and is still fill with incomplete features and a lot of bugs. But hey, it is a indie game, and the game has been programmed with love! And hopefully will be done, in time :)<br/><br/>The game consists of many features, a level editor, multiplayer and a main campaign to play through. To keep it fun and fresh, it is filled with easter-eggs and secret unlocks.<br/><br/>For the future of this game, I'm not really too sure yet. Might give Greenlight ago, maybe try distrubute it on some small indie games websites. But if people were pleased and had actual fun out of the end product, well that would be awesome!<br/><p></p><h2>Where any funds will go..<br/>
</h2><p>Although a laptop would cost around $1000, I did set the bar higher due to extra funds to put towards hours on development when I'm at University. I am not expecting the target to be reached, but every cent will make a huge impact and will be much appreciated. <br/><br/>The funds will go towards a laptop to continue development on Dimensia and future projects while I'm away at University, and any extra funds would eliminate any extra University and living costs. Since I am going to be studying full-time, working will be a problem and may be inconvenient at times. So any extra funds will reduce the need for this, and make me a much happier student! :)</p><p>I have put in the generic perks , the thank you, the credit given, yet Dimensia has a few unique perks which it has to offer. Since the game comes with a 'complete' and easy-to-use *cough* level editor, the user will be able to create his or hers own unique level which will be put into the game at their request. <br/></p><p>The game is based around the main character, with his unique friend 'Henry'. Henry follows the character around the game, and is always seen. One lucky contribute will have the privilege to give him a unique (appropriate) name. <br/></p><p>This is my first project literally ever, and orginially started as just a way to test out some aspects while learning C#. However it turned into quite a hobby and have found a large interest into indie development and the community. Any funds will be much appreciated.<br/>I can guarantee active development, although some days may be slower than others due to University activity. <br/><br/>Yet always feel free to email me at andrewleachy@gmail.com for any requests or anything really!

However it turned into quite a hobby and have found a large interest into indie development and the community. Any funds will be much appreciated.I can guarantee active development, although some days may be slower than others due to University activity. Yet always feel free to email me at andrewleachy@gmail.com for any requests or anything really! Even if you need coding help hit me up with an email.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Besides all that history, time, technology and science is the key in the game to beat your opponents or to survive.From communication(talking) to nuclear weapons and from walking to flying.


Our first build of the game.An abandoned tower.

An oil well.There is no class specification in the game. ""Be what you wanna be"".   

With no traditional story like questing the player has to create it's own story.As the game unfolds, your story will be written, page by page.. Every story in the game is valuable for other players that can find valuable treasures or any other valuable objects in the game.
How far can you explore and discover area's in the world.We are trying to create the player's story as logical and realistic as possible with creatures of course.Even A.I can have a story, they can love you or They wish you we're dead.  

The key of the game is to reclaim every island and slaugther everyone , take them to join your empire or send them to prison .Lets walk through the features.
There are many features in the game but we are taking you through the most important features of the game.

Technology.

Creating a wheel to manufacturing a vehicle.Invent new materials to make the structure of a building more stronger and stable by the help of science.Build a factory to create objects more faster.Develop stronger machines or better armor.

Yes. a stick is your first weapon or shovel. 

Science.

From a monastery that invented paper to a university that discovered atoms.This is the most important feature of the game.Research formula's to invent new materials or to have better fuel for the machines.

The more players/A.I are helping doing research the faster your empire can invent or discover it.
    


Battle for your empire and reclaim your name of the war with every weapon your empire created/invented.
Each player takes a part of the ground in world to have an empire unless it has been claimed by another empire. Your objective is to defeat all of your nations enemies and reclaim that island with your name on it.
Once you are finished reclaiming that island..reclaimed the world.
Spying other nations to steal their belongings, destroy their trading posts/traffic  and capture their towns, destroy it or bombard them with a nuclear ""Hello"".
Bring cannons or tanks ,go airborn or go at sea .There are many ways to have a battle with your opponents.Bring everything your empire got!



One of the 7 island in the world. Concept art.

Each players starts at a random safe place in the world and join an nation or own empire that will ultimately rule all other empires/nations.




Weapons concept art.
There will be magic in the game, but its still in early stages of development. However, we'll promise it will have a big impact on the game.

Skills
Yes there are skills/professions involved in the game but not traditionally like levels with experience points.lets explain what we mean.
If you hit an nail with a hammer on a wooden plank you can hit your thumbs too. The more you are doing it the better you will be in it.It's just practicing.
While practicing certain professions your character can sustain injuries or even death.

<h3>
</h3><h3>Next steps for the HMC game:</h3>
<p>In April 2014, Healthy Minds Canada 
launched a crowdfunding campaign with a goal of raising money and 
awareness about our first in a planned series of fun mobile games 
designed to improve empathy and teach coping skills around mental health
 issues in youth ages 9-16.</p>
<p>Our campaign closed at 11:59pm on May 1<sup>st</sup>. 
 Thanks to your generosity, HMC raised just $5,757 (two people donated $450 via cheques), which covered 
the costs of developing the prototype.  It’s not a secret that this is 
not quite the amount that we had hoped to raise.  However, we were 
thrilled with the amount of support we got from you in the form of blog 
and article posts about our game, page views, tweets and re-tweets, and 
Facebook posts, shares and likes.</p>
<h4>Have a look at our numbers:</h4>
<p><strong>1,681 Unique Indiegogo Page Hits (5,594 total)</strong><br/><strong>4,400 people e-mailed</strong><br/><strong>470 Tweets &amp; 420 Facebook Shares resulted in 483 Social Media Referrals</strong><br/><strong>65 people donated a total of $5,757</strong><br/><strong>(2 people donated $450 via cheques)</strong></p>
<p>While HMC was busy promoting this campaign, our developers, <a href=""http://mojility.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mojility</a>,
 were busy building a “game within a game” called “<a href=""http://healthymindscanada.ca/distractinator/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Distractinator</a>.” 
 It’s designed to promote focusing on a single given task, which may 
help people with a variety of mental health issues (ADHD, Anxiety, 
Depression) who often find external stimuli easily distract them.  In 
this app, the user is must focus on a particular stimulus (a shape) 
while disregarding other external stimuli (other shapes). It will be 
available on the iTunes store and Google Play for free; HMC will provide
 a link to it once it is available. While we work on finding funding for
 our Anti-Bullying game, we’d like to offer you this game as a thank you
 for supporting our campaign.</p>
<p>HMC is still committed to provide a safe, 
online tool that facilitates a process of thinking about situations and

<h3>Why Healthy Minds Canada is entering the Mobile Game space:</h3>
<p>
</p><p>Many of you know that HMC hosts pan-Canada 
Youth Summits and, over the past five years, results have clearly shown 
that young people are very eager to talk about and learn about mental 
health issues.  At these summits, youth learn from other youth that it’s
 OK to talk about mental health issues and that asking for help is not a
 sign of weakness.  But we have also learned that it can be difficult to
 apply such teachings into their own lives.</p>
<p>So we decided to create something that can 
combine a teen’s passive coping skills – such as tuning out and playing 
video games – with active coping skills which include learning 
strategies that help actively process the physical and emotional stress 
that is part of life.</p>
<p>HMC understands that young people have 
smart phones, use them constantly, and love games!  And games can 
provide a safe environment where it is OK to make mistakes and explore 
options while seeking solutions to a variety of challenges teens and 
young adults face in their daily lives.</p>
<p>Our games will be designed to help teach 
users what it feels like to have a mental illness – thereby improving 
empathy, ways of coping if they do have one, and tips and suggestions 
for healthier living.</p>
<p>In short, Healthy Minds Canada is still 
committed to finding and providing innovative ways to help young people 
learn about, and live with, mental illness.</p> <hr/><h1>Healthy Minds Canada: Building Empathy With Mobile Games</h1><ul><li>47% of Canadian parents report having a child victim of bullying</li></ul><ul><li>89% of Canadian Teachers say bullying &amp; cyberbullying are serious problems in schools<br/>

Healthy Minds Canada (HMC) is a national charity that raises funds to support research and education and raise awareness about mental illness and addictions. Since 1980, HMC has funded 400 research projects at 42 universities and teaching hospitals across Canada.</div>","Thank you for your contribution to our campaign.

Next steps for the HMC game:
In April 2014, Healthy Minds Canada 
launched a crowdfunding campaign with a goal of raising money and 
awareness about our first in a planned series of fun mobile games 
designed to improve empathy and teach coping skills around mental health
 issues in youth ages 9-16.
Our campaign closed at 11:59pm on May 1st. 
 Thanks to your generosity, HMC raised just $5,757 (two people donated $450 via cheques), which covered 
the costs of developing the prototype.  It’s not a secret that this is 
not quite the amount that we had hoped to raise.  However, we were 
thrilled with the amount of support we got from you in the form of blog 
and article posts about our game, page views, tweets and re-tweets, and 
Facebook posts, shares and likes.
Have a look at our numbers:
1,681 Unique Indiegogo Page Hits (5,594 total)4,400 people e-mailed470 Tweets & 420 Facebook Shares resulted in 483 Social Media Referrals65 people donated a total of $5,757(2 people donated $450 via cheques)
While HMC was busy promoting this campaign, our developers, Mojility,
 were busy building a “game within a game” called “The Distractinator.” 
 It’s designed to promote focusing on a single given task, which may 
help people with a variety of mental health issues (ADHD, Anxiety, 
Depression) who often find external stimuli easily distract them.  In 
this app, the user is must focus on a particular stimulus (a shape) 
while disregarding other external stimuli (other shapes). It will be 
available on the iTunes store and Google Play for free; HMC will provide
 a link to it once it is available. While we work on finding funding for
 our Anti-Bullying game, we’d like to offer you this game as a thank you
 for supporting our campaign.
HMC is still committed to provide a safe, 
online tool that facilitates a process of thinking about situations and 
experiences that can help the user explore, learn, build resilience, and
 become a responsible, compassionate citizen in their off-line lives and
 over the next few months, we will be reaching out to potential partners
 and sponsors for our first game.

With feedback from our previous 2017 CES gaming innovation of the year mouse, The Z, we were motivated to deliver on three key user requests when creating TRACER;

Awesome Driver Software: powerful, customizable, yet intuitive & easy-to-use 

Auto-game detection:  expert profiles auto-loaded – play straight out of the box 

Amazing Value: premium unique features like deep click but at an amazing price
Hi, we're Swiftpoint, a small technology company from New Zealand. We believe in pushing the boundaries and challenging the status quo. Swiftpoint has a history of creating unique, CES award-winning products, four of which were made possible through crowdfunding. Now we’re back to do it again, and are very excited to introduce TRACER.It’s time to change the game and play different!We’ve been developing specialized software to support our unique hardware products for a decade now, and have learned a thing or two over the years. By leveraging our experience and building on our current software products we’ve come up with a powerful, yet user-friendly software suite for TRACER.Not only has it had a ‘face-lift’ in terms of the way it looks, but it’s also now easier to set up and use. In fact, we’ve aimed to make it so easy to use, by adding auto-game detection and pre-loaded gaming profiles, that you don’t even need to touch it... unless you want to… We know that setting-up and learning new software can be tedious, and take up valuable time that you’d rather spend gaming. So from installation right through to set up, we’ve made it easy. Plug TRACER in, download the software, begin playing your favorite game, and we'll do the rest - it’s that easy!TRACER’s software will detect what games you have installed on your computer and automatically install our expert profiles for any games we support, so you don’t have to spend time messing around with keybinds. If you want to make tweaks to a profile, simply use the game-specific ‘action libraries’, which allows you to select what each button does from a dropdown list that matches the game you’re playing. No more switching between the game menu and your desktop to set up the software - customization made easy! When you launch a game, TRACER will switch to the correct profile, automatically and instantly. No more forgetting to activate the correct profile, no more minimizing mid-game to access the software, and no need to create a single basic profile that sort of works (but not very well...) for every game you own. It’s not enough to just create a world-class gaming mouse, we wanted to make it as affordable as we could to get it into as many hands as possible.With TRACER, we’ve opted to bring you a more streamlined feature-set to focus on the most loved features at a reduced price. We’ve then coupled this feature refinement with further savings by having our production team undertake an excruciating review of every single component of our Swiftpoint Z gaming mouse. They’ve optimized them to the nth degree, negotiated the best possible prices, and ordered bulk manufacturing in advance.To lock-in pricing, we’ve already gone ahead and built the first production run of mice, ready for launch.Get in quick to grab yourself TRACER at our special crowdfunding launch price! Adding to the impressive lineup of 13 buttons, TRACER's two left mouse buttons have built-in pressure sensors. ‘Deep click’ gives you more buttons and more flexibility - click normally for one action, or harder for another action. Each 'Deep Click' button can have up to 3 actions assigned to it!For example;Fortnite - Shoot and then deep click to instantly build a wall World of Warcraft - Trigger a skill and then deep click to activate it instantly. Overwatch - Roadhog's Shrapnel Ball, Chain hook, and melee attack  Some other useful examples include;

Crouch / prone - Press normally to crouch, press hard to instantly go prone

Sniper button - press one button reduce your sensitivity, then press harder to fire

Rapid reload / weapon switch - use left click to fire, then press hard to instantly begin reloading, or to switch to your secondary weapon
Or, use deep click to set up your own commonly used combo 
TRACER supports all software and games, and includes pre-made gaming profiles for leading games, including: Apex Legends, Borderlands 3, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, Final Fantasy XIV Online, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, Fortnite, Overwatch, League of Legends, and World of Warcraft. Auto profile switching is when our software automatically selects the correct profile based on what you're currently playing. Our software will detect when you launch one of our supported games and automatically enable that profile.   Our TRACER software comes pre-loaded with a selection of game specific 'Action Libraries'. These 'Action Libraries' contain all of the default keybinds for supported games. They allow you to easily configure your mouse simply choosing the game-specific action that you want on that button. For example, to change the Left Trigger button from 'Drop Weapon' to 'Smoke Grenade' simply click on the drop down box and find (or type) 'grenade'.    To create your own game profile, click on the 'Create Profile' button, give your profile a name and away you go. You can also choose to add an icon and link to the game so it will be switched to automatically. Once you've created your profile, set up your mappings by clicking on any button, pressing the 'keyboard recorder' icon and then pressing the keyboard button that you'd like to bind.

<div>We are Radiation Touch Games, a small game developer company from Norway housing two developers with several years of experience using programs such as 3DSMax, Photoshop, Visual Studio and similar programs. As we earlier only used these programs in our sparetime to make fun doodles, silly programs or high poly 3D models, we went on a mission to bring this combined knowledge into something useful. The choice was simple, to make a game. Never a second was that decision given a second thought, long developing time do not scare us. Why? Because this have been a lifelong dream with the possibility of coming true. </div>
<div>Our very first game is called Twisted Universe, and with that game, we aim to make an impact. To bring something new, something truly unique to the market. That is what we stand for. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><span><span><img alt=""why Indiegogo image headline"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.radiationtouch.com/uploads/2/6/0/1/2601328/2362036_orig.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""indiegogo headline""/></span></span></div>
<div>Why are we here on IndieGoGo exactly? Now that is actually a pretty good question, therefore it deserves a good answer. Because making a game does not only require effort and time, but also money and dedication. We have got a lot of time on our hands, we are ready to make the effort, and we certainly have the dedication required. Sadly we lack the funds to make the game a reality within a reasonable amount of time. We have tried to find outside funding, but it has been hard to find something without any strings or shady deals attached to it. Running the risk of going bankrupt before the game has released is not really an option. So that is why we are here, we need your help on this one!</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""what will we use the money for image headline"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.radiationtouch.com/uploads/2/6/0/1/2601328/6248897_orig.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""what will we use the money for headline""/></div>
<div>The money will be strictly used to cover the expenses involved in making the game. Like paying for licenses for the 3D software and hardware, but also to advertise and put our word out. We tried to find equipment we could pay for with monopoly bills, but people seemed to like real life money better. Our landlord also insists on us paying monthly sums for our office space and electricity. So does our Internet service provider too for the connection to the world wide web.</div>
<div>We therefore ask politely for 50 000 US Dollars as it will cover the basic things we need. The more money we raise beyond that point, the better the equipment we can acquire. The better the equipment, the more content we can make before the initial release. Why more content you say? Because the better the computers, the shorter the rendering and compiling time. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""what do you get in return headline"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.radiationtouch.com/uploads/2/6/0/1/2601328/916860_orig.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""what do you get in return headline""/></div>
<div>We are not asking for your money without giving you anything, bandits do, and you get to shoot a lot of bandits in Twisted Universe when it is released. We do not blame you for wanting something in return for helping us out, and we will do our best to give you something cool for your effort and hard earned money.

<div><span>Twisted Universe is our very first project here at Radiation Touch Games. Featuring a Sidescroller shooter gameplay / FPS gameplay style set in various parts throughout the Universe. Upon starting the game, you take the role as Aeleen Riigel, the newest addition to the United Space Federations elite squad. As a rookie you finally get to play with the big guys with fancy ranks and fat paychecks. It is a dream come true, until your first mission goes horribly wrong, and you are forced to abandon your past life and start over from the very beginning.</span></div>

<div>
<span> </span>The main gameplay will be covered by a Sidescroller Shooter style experience. You traverse from point A to the left side to point B on the right side much like the same way that Super Mario works. Just put mario and the whole mushroom kingdom aside and replace him with a ship midair, and the mushroom kingdom with a part of the universe you will be visiting for a brief period.</div>

<div>The map will autoscroll and so you will be able to move back and forth, up and down to cover all parts of the visible space. On your way you will encounter resitance more than happy to sacrifice themselves for the greater good of their master or treasure. </div>

<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>Seing as you can modify the ship with a variety of weapon setups you are likely to have the firepower to gun the unfortunate souls to pieces. But if the ship is a agile as a cow, you may not stand much of a chance. Changing your ship may help you navigate through the hail of bullets, a lighter ship however will have less space for lovely guns, so choose wisely between your options. </span></div>
<div><span>If you are skilled enough to make it to Point B you are very likely to encounter a boss, and this guy is not playing around. </span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>The boss is not just your average fightervessel, it is the mothership of the opposite fleet you are gunning for. Judging by the difference in size between the two of you, your puny little ship should not be a match for such a battlecruiser. Lucky for you, size is not all. When you tap the motherships hull to a certain degree, you will be able to ram your little fightership straight into the mothership.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The battle is not over yet. As you ram the mothership and break through its hull, you change from Sidescroller gameplay to a FPS style gameplay. You are now in the belly of the beast, and it is all up to you and your personalized firearms to run for the captain. You will have to put your moral to the test as you plow through armed workers and security guards on your run for the big guy. When the big guy is done for, and/or you have aquired what you came for, the mission is over and you can collect your reward as soon as you have gotten out of the raging inferno you left the mothership and its crew in.  ¨</div>

<strong>Discalaimer:</strong> Twisted Universe is still a work in progress and is subject to change. What you see is not representing the final product, but it is however visualizing what the final product may look like. Twisted Universe' launch date is 23rd of August 2013, but can be subject to delay.</div></div>","We are Radiation Touch Games, a small game developer company from Norway housing two developers with several years of experience using programs such as 3DSMax, Photoshop, Visual Studio and similar programs. As we earlier only used these programs in our sparetime to make fun doodles, silly programs or high poly 3D models, we went on a mission to bring this combined knowledge into something useful. The choice was simple, to make a game. Never a second was that decision given a second thought, long developing time do not scare us. Why? Because this have been a lifelong dream with the possibility of coming true. 
Our very first game is called Twisted Universe, and with that game, we aim to make an impact. To bring something new, something truly unique to the market. That is what we stand for. 
 

Why are we here on IndieGoGo exactly? Now that is actually a pretty good question, therefore it deserves a good answer. Because making a game does not only require effort and time, but also money and dedication. We have got a lot of time on our hands, we are ready to make the effort, and we certainly have the dedication required. Sadly we lack the funds to make the game a reality within a reasonable amount of time. We have tried to find outside funding, but it has been hard to find something without any strings or shady deals attached to it. Running the risk of going bankrupt before the game has released is not really an option. So that is why we are here, we need your help on this one!
 

The money will be strictly used to cover the expenses involved in making the game. Like paying for licenses for the 3D software and hardware, but also to advertise and put our word out. We tried to find equipment we could pay for with monopoly bills, but people seemed to like real life money better. Our landlord also insists on us paying monthly sums for our office space and electricity. So does our Internet service provider too for the connection to the world wide web.
We therefore ask politely for 50 000 US Dollars as it will cover the basic things we need. The more money we raise beyond that point, the better the equipment we can acquire. The better the equipment, the more content we can make before the initial release. Why more content you say? Because the better the computers, the shorter the rendering and compiling time. 
 

We are not asking for your money without giving you anything, bandits do, and you get to shoot a lot of bandits in Twisted Universe when it is released. We do not blame you for wanting something in return for helping us out, and we will do our best to give you something cool for your effort and hard earned money. Here are some of the perks for you to enjoy:

are stranded on an island, The plane you came with have crashed, and you are
alive. To survive on the island you'll have to find food, water and shelter.
It's up to you. 
-Do
you have the knowledge to know what you can eat or not? 
-Are you faster alone but maybe stronger as a team? 
Decide
how you want to play the game. Level your character to increase the skill
level. Use your skills on the talent tree to make the character survive the
best.

Your character is a normal human
being. You need food and water to survive. If you don't have enough, you'll
eventually get tired and slow. This will affect your gameplay. Use your mind
and get supplies. Explore the world and see what you can eat and drink, but be
careful! 

As you level your character you'll
increase your skill level and reach your goal. The more you explore the game, the
faster you'll level up your character.


Choose your way to survive. Are you
a runner or an explorer? You decide how you want to skill your character and
play the game. Choose
the way of the Explorer, Survivor or Hunter.

Gather different resources. Scavenge
around the world and see if you can find anything useful. Use your tools for
gathering different materials.

Use collected resources to craft
different items in the game. Learn new  prestige items to craft. Construct
your housing and weapons to hunt animal and fight others to reach your goal. 

Multiplayer - This game mode is

Hey, it was my lunch break! The doodles began to evolve into a character I called Chompy. He's got big teeth and a big appetite. I showed the drawings to a few friends and they suggested I make a game out of it. I began writing together the basic rules of what I thought would be a unique and entertaining game. Here's the story.<br/> </p><h3>Backstory</h3><p>A fat, greedy monarch named King Chomp is in charge and has been for a while. He's got the biggest appetite and eats over a ton of food every day. Everyone thinks he can use a diet. One day, the King's counselor delivers a report that even more crops have been destroyed due to the disease. The King believes this is the work of an enemy force in order to weaken his defenses for a takeover. The King decides to slowly hoard food for himself and his inner circle of influence leaving the residents exiled, starving, and many resorting to cannibalism to survive. You are Chompy and your mission is to prevent a war, eradicate the disease, and save your species from extinction. No pressure!<br/> </p><h3>How to Play</h3><p><br/>Your character will move forward automatically one block at a time, but you must swipe to change direction. Your health indicator in the top right is decreasing the entire time you are playing and once depleted, you instantly starve to death. To delay starvation, you can eat fruit for a small bump in health. You can eat other bots to fully restore your health, but that can only be done in attack mode. Enter/exit attack mode by double tapping the screen and this will double your movement speed. In attack mode, your health is going down twice as fast!<br/>You die when you run out of health, get eaten by another chomp, or when you fall off the map. Be careful out there!

<p> </p>
<p>My current funding goal for this project is <strong>$8000</strong>. This will cover my personal expenses for aproximatly <strong>4-6 months</strong> and allow me to work on this game <strong>full time</strong> and see that I can pay for the help needed above which are outside of my expertise, as well as commit<strong> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">weekly updates and videos</span></strong>, and produce aplayable beta for those who decide to contribute.

<p>If the funding exceeds the goal, I will <em>pay forward</em> my monthly expenses so that I may continue to support ongoing work on this project and add extra features post-development.</p>
<p>Further funding will be used to secure music licenses and add to existing ones due to the fact the they limit the number of copies that I will be allowed to sell.</p>
<p>If I am so fortunate that funds exceed this amount, I will also let them flow over into my next game project.</p>

If the funding exceeds the goal, I will pay forward my monthly expenses so that I may continue to support ongoing work on this project and add extra features post-development.
Further funding will be used to secure music licenses and add to existing ones due to the fact the they limit the number of copies that I will be allowed to sell.
If I am so fortunate that funds exceed this amount, I will also let them flow over into my next game project.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

I'm Dave Vogt; I run operations at Gaming World Wide; a gaming group and website that focuses on charity, information, and entertainment. Beyond that, I hold several gaming world records, and have dabbled in independent game design for years. So, I'm bringing it all together. This title, The Bounty, is a unique, retro styled, high score based RPG. A roguelike with a classic arcade edge. It's meant to challenge the player, and inspire them to push their limits further. You start your game, and delve into the dungeon; everything you do rewards you with points. But there are no shops, no inns, no safehouses. Once you die, you die. You're awarded your score, and return to the title screen. Next time you might do better. Of course, you might end up in different levels this time.  Above all that? The game is being released for free. Featuring custom sprite work by Mike ""NESQuester"" Wright, we have the highest expectations of this game to bring you back to the old days, in a new way.</p><p>   This is the second leg of the funding campaign. (the initial page can be found here) While we fell far short of our goals, the funds acquired allowed us to purchase some of the equipment and software needed. We have made great progress; despite funding and technical hiccups, approximately 25%  of the primary game is finished. The amount of work still to be done is staggering, but it is transforming into an incredible game that will stand tall next to the best RPGs of the 16 bit generation, while maintaining it's own unique personality. This is only possible with YOUR help.</p><p>     Care to try it now? I've assembled a pre-alpha demo. This is proof of concept only; just enough to get the object of the game across, using all stock middleware RTP assets. <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/h6qzy85nwupwjcp/The%20Bounty%20Demov03.exe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YOU CAN FIND AND DOWNLOAD THE DEMO HERE.</a></p><p><b>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</b></p><p>So, how much are we looking for? The lower end is $2500. This will cover a bare minimum of development costs such as hardware, software, and staff. Going up to a more desirable $5000 and beyond will get us custom chiptune music, more artwork, and more specialized hardware. Basically, a more awesome final product, and a framework to deliver new level packs and sequels in the future. </p><p>  The perks really involve you in the development. Your contributions will have you designing levels in the dungeons, helping create items, and even becoming a playable character! I'll personally work with you to ensure maximum balancing and playability, so it's a fun and easy way to make a real creative contribution; a personal touch beyond a standard financial funding-for a perk. If you prefer promotional items, those are options as well, of course; including custom t-shirts and posters.</p><p>  A little something else to say thank you to our backers; included in every perk is not only a timed early release of The Bounty, but also an exclusive level pack. This collection of fun special levels will be only released to indiegogo backers; though you can share if you want to. ;)</p><p>    We're aiming for an updated release date of February 1st, 2014. This could be delayed; whether there is a huge influx of fan created content, technical issues, or if additional debugging/QA testing is required. February 1st is the goal however, and video diaries will be recorded frequently, keeping you up to date on the progress.</p><p>     What if we don't reach our goal? A basic version of the game will be built. The art/music assets will be weaker, QA/bug testing will be limited; but there will be a well playing, quality game to be found!</p><p><b>THE IMPACT</b></p><p>As AAA games get bigger and bigger, players are turning to independent games for those classic experiences the big studios don't bother with anymore. The Bounty is the real deal, with every detail painstakingly built and fine tuned by a world class competitor. To be able to present this experience to the world, free of charge... is beyond explanation. </p><p><b>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</b></p><p>If you can't contribute financially, there's still plenty you can do to help make this a reality! Beyond indiegogo's sharing tools, you can hype up this project, pass it around to the people you know. Get creative! Feel free to contact me directly on this page, or via email at da3vevogt@gwwentertainment.com Anything you can do is most appreciated.</p><br/></div>","HELLO! Let me tell you a little about myself, and this project.

If you prefer promotional items, those are options as well, of course; including custom t-shirts and posters.  A little something else to say thank you to our backers; included in every perk is not only a timed early release of The Bounty, but also an exclusive level pack. This collection of fun special levels will be only released to indiegogo backers; though you can share if you want to. ;)    We're aiming for an updated release date of February 1st, 2014. This could be delayed; whether there is a huge influx of fan created content, technical issues, or if additional debugging/QA testing is required. February 1st is the goal however, and video diaries will be recorded frequently, keeping you up to date on the progress.     What if we don't reach our goal? A basic version of the game will be built. The art/music assets will be weaker, QA/bug testing will be limited; but there will be a well playing, quality game to be found!THE IMPACTAs AAA games get bigger and bigger, players are turning to independent games for those classic experiences the big studios don't bother with anymore. The Bounty is the real deal, with every detail painstakingly built and fine tuned by a world class competitor. To be able to present this experience to the world, free of charge... is beyond explanation. OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPIf you can't contribute financially, there's still plenty you can do to help make this a reality! Beyond indiegogo's sharing tools, you can hype up this project, pass it around to the people you know. Get creative!

<p>Crowdfunding is the perfect way for aspiring developers to have their game ideas not only heard, but funded by fellow gamers who would love to play those games without a publisher interfering. I'm not a fan of some ominous power looming over the project's development, picking it apart and overshadowing the developer's creation in order to make it as mainstream as possible. Chapters of Fortuna is more than just a video game to me. It's about creating a video game that evokes nostalgia in the hearts of gamers with it's graphics and gameplay, while adding a very fresh and enjoyable story and setting that hasn't been done before. The two things I am going to guarantee everyone right here and now are that all money raised for this project is going to be spent on this project (so that if I exceed the $10,000, any additional money will be entirely spent on designing additional content to the final game) and you will enjoy the final product if you're a fan of SNES era RPGs.</p>

You are not a fighter, you are a lawyer, a bureaucrat.  Besides, in a building that is meant to be self-contained and never be exposed to the outside, the last thing you want is a gun.  Survival is up to you, if you can unlock the puzzles to find your way out.  Take too long and  you may not survive.  Go too fast and you might miss something important.  The path and how you get there is entirely in your hands.</p><p><b><i>Why crowdfund the game?</i></b></p><p>Accordion Games is a small studio, but we also need to be able to pay people for their hard work on Arcology.  Contractors, like all of us, need to eat too.  To make a professional quality game, we need professional artists, sound designers, and voice actors.  While we go out of our way to try and include students and give them a way to build their portfolios, it's only right that everyone is compensated.  Your support makes that possible.</p><p><b><i>What Platforms will Arcology be on?</i></b></p><p>Arcology is slated for release on PC in 2015.  Depending on licensing, a release on the Playstation 4 or Xbox One would be feasible as well.  At this time, however, the game is PC only.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p> <p><b><i>What We Need </i></b></p><p>To make Arcology the best quality game it can be, our budget is $40,000, which is broken down as follows:</p><p>Equipment, <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Dev Kits, </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Licenses, </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Fees, Staff</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">: $22,500</span></p><p>Contractors (Artists, Sound Designers, Voice Actors): $17,500</p><p>If we don't reach the entire goal, any funds received will go to covering the cost of Dev Kits, Licenses, Fees, and whatever is left will pay for any necessary <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">contractors. </span></p><p><font color=""#6a6a6a""><b><i>What You Get </i></b></font></p><p><font color=""#6a6a6a"">By contributing to our campaign, you can get any number of different perks, from a thank you in the credits, to a copy of the game, to your likeness on pictures in the game, or even a character named after you.  We want you to make your mark on Arcology, to be a part of the world we are making.</font></p><p><font color=""#6a6a6a""><br/></font></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span><br/></p> <p>Arcology will not be like many first-person games, in that there are no weapons.

<h3>Let me tell
ye a story! The story of AirBuccaneers!<br/>
</h3>
<p>A long time
ago, on the ungodly year of two thousand and four to be exact, a bunch of crazy
Finns embarked on a journey to create a multiplayer game like none have seen
before. And so the AirBuccaneers was born - an Unreal Tournament 2004 Mod which
battled its way into the third place on Make Something Unreal Contest of 2004.
As the crazy Finns concentrated their efforts on overtaking new challenges on
the field of serious games, the AirBuccaneers fell under the veil of history
and was forgottenâ€¦<br/></p>

ON THE YEAR 2012 - THE BUCCANEERS RISE FROM THE ASHES OF OBLIVION AND TAKE THE

HD takes the players into a huge world engulfed in never-ending war between the
Buccaneers and the Vikings. Players command heavily armed hot air balloons in
fearsome battles. Flawless co-operation and nerves of steel are the keys to
success. Course of war is determined by individual battles until one side is
victorious. As the winning side is clear, the highest acclaimed warrior from
their ranks takes over the throne, and bestows his name upon the next era in
the world of AirBuccaneers.</span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>We've been funding this project from our own pockets thus far and we got to the point where our wallets are running thin. Now we need the help of you fans to make this game happen! The starving Buccaneers and Vikings truly appreciate your help.</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Normally games of this magnitude cost millions to make. And they have marketing budgets that are as big or even bigger as the development budget. We are a small game studio courageously sailing in the stormy seas of game business and we haven't yet got a publisher backing us up. But we have one ace up our sleeves - We can make a game of this level happen with a fraction of the normal cost. Our initial development budget was only 1.2 Million Euros but we've already cut it down to 500 000 Euros. And we still were able to expand the game from the original plans.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This is the first funding phase which ends on 28th of February as we release the Alpha version of the AirBuccaneers HD. This also drops some of the stuff off from the game packs and bumps their prices up. And most importantly, the legendary Last Song of VÃ¤inÃ¤mÃ¶inen won't be available anymore. So get into buccaneering fast and receive legendary amounts of booty before it is too late.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We need the money to keep our programmers, artists and 3D modelers fed and paid. If we can't reach the target, we have to start cutting stuff from the game. Starting from in game items, skills and other game experience expanding features that'll be added later on. Then we have to start dropping characters and maps and so on. In the end, there's a risk that the project never gets into full completion.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>You can also help us by buying one of the first five perk levels from our own shop in the AirBuccaneers HD website at <a href=""http://www.airbuccaneers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.airbuccaneers.com</a>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Okay, then to the fun part. What do you get to yourself by investing in AirBuccaneers:<br/>
</div>
<p>You always get the game as it is at the moment. And trust us, it's already lots of fun. Naturally you'll also get all future development versions and the finished game once it is released.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>You can also unlock various amounts of extra content for the game and extra swag for yourself by backing us up more than the minimum amount.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here's a descriptive table on the contents of different Tiers:</p>

<div>
<strong><em><br/></em></strong>Telling stories is innate to humans. We have always told stories and we always will. One of the things I am very proud of in this game is the way it supports storytelling. In this game, there are specific, mechanical incentives for telling a good story. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Intrique, envy and ambition are also very human. We all have stories about times we had to be careful of how we acted, or things we wanted, or working to reach a goal.

<div> </div>
<div>The way the layers of the game connect creates a level of inventiveness and expressiveness in role-playing that I really love. In the course of the game, each Courtier is called on to portray a character in a Story. The Story level is where the tales of magic lamps and flying carpets and clever servant maids who outsmart bandit chieftans all come to life. And because of this characters-within-characters approach, amazing things can happen in the Story.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm ready to print the second edition of <strong><em>A Thousand and One Nights: a game of enticing stories</em></strong>. The writing, the art, the layout, the editing - it's all finished. The next step is getting it printed, and shipping it out. Funds from this campaign go to making that happen.</div>
<div>
<h3>The details</h3>
I'm hoping to raise 1,001 dollars in order to cover a first print run large enough to keep costs down for you and for me. I've set this campaign for flexible funding, which means everything you pledge I can use. All levels of support are great, but I want to share a bit more about these three:</div>

<div>
<strong>Visiting Scholar</strong><br/><p>I love story-telling, I love role-playing games, and I love books. When I was doing playtesting for the 1st edition, way back in 2005, I ran sessions of the game at various local libraries as part of their summer teen activities. This reward is in gratitude for the openness and enthusiasm of those librarians, and the imagination of the players. I'm looking forward to sending copies of <strong><em>A Thousand and One Nights </em></strong>to public libraries across the country, to support and encourage gaming and reading and <em>libraries full of stories</em>! </p>
<p><strong>Jeweler to the Court</strong></p>
<p>In<strong> <em>A Thousand and One Nights</em></strong>, dice are the gems of the Sultan. It does not matter what size dice they are, only that they are beautiful and remind you of gems and precious stones. Making the game more about the flow of the story and less about the numbers is a real design goal of mine, successfully reached. The antique brass bowls are inscribed on the outside with Arabic-style caligraphy and designs. <strong><br/></strong></p>

<h3><strong>The Sultan's Own Chef</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>A Thousand and One Nights</em></strong> is a sensual game. As the Sultan's Own Chef, you have a unique opportunity to make your game night into an occasion to remember. This reward includes a booklet of fitting recipes, collected and adapted by Vincent Baker, to create several delightful feasts or one true extravaganza.

</div><p> </p></div>","Short description
To develop the project need a good 3D printers for prototyping. Currently owned 3d printer is too small for the larger models. Some words about Me:

For 10 years I lead technology projects for companies around the world. I was involved in designing solutions CNC, 3D Printing, Wearable technology, Augumented reality. Schemed successfully cardboard models of aircraft and vehicles. It operates in 3 CAD (Rhino 3D Fusion 360, Solidworks) and 2 3D applications such as 3DS Max and Blender.

The campaign aims to bring together the necessary resources for prototyping designed parts, With your help I can greatly accelerate the development of the project.
 


 

What You Get

Main perk is 3d printed 737 Yoke. ActuallyI finishing its design to make it so close to real as possible.

What I Need
Some details about project:

I need to gather about 1500 usd to buy almost new 3d printer Zortrax M200. Why such a printer. Becouse its just print I've seen it live and its reliable printer that no need of tune or anything its just print that will help focus on designing not servicing.
Check on the right as You can to support the project. I think You will find something for Yourself.
Earned funds will be used to buy a 3D printer, making the ordered part in the campaign.

Files on the platform Thingiverse have been downloaded more than 4000 times.
Project is alive over 8 months.
You can speed up testing of developed parts.


Risks & Challenges
So far I collected funds through voluntary donations, but only had enough material to print. Today, I need your help. I met with a huge amount of positive news from you. Today she needs material support.

For 7 years of experience in technology prototyping I believe that the items that you will receive will be fully useful and meet your expectations.
I will make my best to continue project.

Blackwyrm Books And Games is a publisher of experimental fiction and quality roleplaying games. In conjunction with Hero Games' release of the Star Hero 6th Edition roleplaying game at GenCon 2011, we are attempting to simultaneously release seven science fiction settings that can be played using the Star Hero rules.  
 
We're calling this entire undertaking Project WyrmStar. 



The Impact

Hero Games isn't planning on releasing any settings for Star Hero: only the core rulebook and some equipment books. We are hoping to ""fill the gap"" that leaves by releasing unique and interesting setting books that can be used to play the game immediately, rather than forcing Game Masters to take the time to create their own setting. 
 
The Wreck of Alpha Central for HERO System 6th Edition is one of these settings. 




What We Need & What You Get

Ecumenopolis. 
 
It means ""world city"", and science fiction is full of them -- Isaac Asimov's Trantor and the Star Wars series' Coruscant are two of the most well known, but there are plenty more. Depending on your view of city living, such visions can be invigorating or terrifying. Or both. It is hard to imagine the scale of such places; many times, writers give population figures that ""sound big"" but are ludicrously small. If we assume that only the land area of an Earth-sized world can be built on, and we assume that only 75% of that can be used, and we give it a population density comparable to the most densely populated modern regions, we end up with 2-4 trillion people, depending on which numbers we pick. However, even the most densely populated modern cities don't include mile-high apartment complexes or a hundred sublevels below the surface -- based on the visual and written descriptions, a typical science-fiction ecumenopolis could easily have ten times that many people and still offer most residents tolerable living quarters, with room for open areas, parks, stadiums, and plazas. 
 
So what happens to a world of 40 trillion people when the food shipments stop and the lights go out?
 
That's what Ian Harac’s setting The Wreck of Alpha Central is all about: what happens when after the catastrophic collapse of a once-proud ecumenpolis, leaving it a husk filled with high-tech ruins, mutants, monsters, and forgotten wonders.

At this stretch goal we'll add a male option when creating your character.  $2500 will cover the costs of making the character art, professionally recording the voice acting and doing the coding needed to make it work.  You'll be able to customize his appearance and name much like the main character in the game right now, and we may be able to throw in a few new customization options for both male and female if this goal is achieved.  And thank you!  This is a choice we would love to give you when playing the game!

$15,000 - BONUS PART 5

Continue the adventure!  For this goal we will make and release a Bonus Part 5 of Abducted.  There's some material we have right now that could be a part of it, it would just need to be finished (essentially this is cut material, not cut for quality purposes, but cut right now to make the game tight and producable).  For a small amount we can work it back in to the story and have it released by the end of the game.  And if we manage to reach this goal, thank you very much!  This will allow us to make the end of the game much stronger!


  
If we are funded at least partially through Indiegogo, it will give us additional freedom and 
resources to expand the game and make it better immediately.
We released Crow on iOS and Mac platforms in 2012.  As an indie 
developer's first title, we did reasonably well.  Crow has over 200,000 
players on Game Center and we attracted a small but loyal following of 
gamers. Crow has a PC version too, and is about to be released on Steam.
The micro-funding we're seeking on Indiegogo is very low risk.  Abducted Part 1 has already shipped on iOS and can be downloaded and played today.

If you can't contribute that's ok!  We tried to keep the perks very low priced so anyone can do this, but you can still help us in many ways!
Give us a like on Facebook, follow us on Twitter, and subscribe to our Youtube channel.  We promise to keep it interesting!
Tell your friends about us!  Did you play Crow or Abducted and enjoy the hell out of them?  Tell people you know!  Blog about it, tweet about it!  Take the time to write us a positive review!
Of course spread the word on our Indiegogo campaign!  Let everyone know about it and maybe if you can't contribute, someone you know can.


Thank you so much!  You read this far, you've seen what we're up to.  Thank you for helping us and we'll see you in the game.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Since we started this business venture, we always had such a big project like a plastic box in mind but never had the chance, contacts and most important the financial resources to bring this thought to life. As we grew bigger and eventually find a company to produce and a sculptor to make the figures we finally decided to start this project and give it a go.</p>
<p>We made some bad experience and learned that things don't come easy and good things do take their time (a long one to be sure!) but after all the hard work, we are finally here for the last, big step.</p>
<p>As you may have already seen, most of the sculpting work is already done but <i>""only""</i> the big steel plastic-injection mould is missing which is by far the most expensive part of this big-ticket project. And for that reason we need all you hobbyists, painters, collectors and gamers out there to support us.</p>
<p>With this Indiegogo-Campaign we want to produce a full plastic-set filled with wargamer goodness and eventually many other lead miniatures plus more plastic if our funding-goal is exceeded by far!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>When will the miniatures be released?<br/>
</h3>I get many questions about the shipping of the products. It is really difficult to tell. Once we have all the financial resources we ship all parts to Renedra Ltd who cast our miniatures and make the plastic injection mould. <br/>However, this progress of making a mould takes long - very long! And you have to add our waiting time as Renedra won't immediately start with making the mold once our master miniatures are with them. An exact date can't be given, but don't expect them before summer 2015! <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>So what do I get and how does it work?<br/>
</h3>This crowdfunding campaign is quite simple: you do donate a certain amount of money (mostly by choosing one of the so called ""perks"" to the right) and in exchange you will get the to-be-funded product plus some extra perk-goodies once the product is available and the financial-goal is reached.<br/>If we do not reach our financial-goal you will get your spent money immediately back in full amount.<br/><br/>We do have 9 perks in total (Perk 2-9 are called level 1-8. With any level you will receive miniatures and extra stuff) for which you pay a fix cost. All pledged perks together are shown in the above right corner next to the financial-goal or below with illustrations. <br/>Once the financial-goal is reached, we will update this Indiegogo-site with plans for more miniatures to be released (further called stretch goals) with the excess money.<br/><br/><b>While you are paying for one perk/level you can even increase the money you want to be pledged. This can either be because of an additional donation from your side or that you want to buy some extra stretch goals (Add-Ons) once they are reached or all always available as single Add-On's. <br/>Simply write in your pledge comments which extra Add-on you like.<br/>Please take note that we do have some deals that include ""all reached goals"" and that buying the goals seperately may causes a higher price in total.</b><br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What is in the Plastic Box?<br/>
</h3>In this box will be 24 hard plastic 28mm (1/56) miniatures that come with a leaflet (approximately 16-18 pages full with historical background, assembling tips, painting shemes etc) and a single sheet with six different flags.<br/><br/>The box will hold 4 frames in total. Two core Landsknecht frames plus two extra command frames. <br/>The core frame will contain 10 different bodies plus 20 different heads as well as enough arms to have yours  Landsknechts in advancing and marching poses with weapon options for halberds, spears and pikes. The frame will also hold extra swords, pouches and other nice extras.<br/>The command frame will include 2 bodies plus a huge selection of extra heads, enough parts for musicians and banner bearers.<br/><br/>Here is a pre-view for the miniatures. <b>Please note that these only represent a very small part of what is in the box. We can't show you many more sculpts due the WIP-status of the project.</b> So what's missing on the picture? All upright arms, many more heads, command options, little extra (pouches, hats, etc). <br/>For some detail shots, please scroll until the very bottom of this campaign!

<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>We are a team of two indie developers creating our vision of what retro 2D platforming games should be. Matthew and Declan both met as a result of a earlier project Matthew had worked on, 4Space. 4Space was a minecraft mod that allowed players to visit any planet in the solar system, Declan had made videos on the mod and became a follower of it. Both Declan and Matthew had talked frequently about various topics, one was becoming a indie developer team, so in mid 2015 they became a team and Equlibrium Games was born. Right now we are making a game called DarkNote and that is probably why you are here, read about it below!</div>

</div>
</div><div> <p>DarkNote is a 2D platformer game that uses a Perlin generator to create infinite assortments of music and levels to explore. We use a difficulty level on players to determine how hard each level should be, as the player goes throughout each level they will pick up experience, lives, health, points and attacks. When a player goes to a new level they will take experience, lives and attacks there health and points will be saved to a scoreboard but will be reset in the new level. If you fail to complete a level your difficulty rate will drop, but if you succeed and advance to a new level the difficulty rate you play will increase. Your final level points and health will help determine how much difficulty you will gain. Enemy's are also scored under a difficulty rating, its not often that you will fight higher level enemy's. Please remember that DarkNote is early in development, some features, textures and game systems may change.</p>

<div>DarkNote was conceived as an adaptation of Matthew’s side project FMusic which was never intended to be released.

</div></div>","We are a team of two indie developers creating our vision of what retro 2D platforming games should be. Matthew and Declan both met as a result of a earlier project Matthew had worked on, 4Space. 4Space was a minecraft mod that allowed players to visit any planet in the solar system, Declan had made videos on the mod and became a follower of it. Both Declan and Matthew had talked frequently about various topics, one was becoming a indie developer team, so in mid 2015 they became a team and Equlibrium Games was born. Right now we are making a game called DarkNote and that is probably why you are here, read about it below!





 DarkNote is a 2D platformer game that uses a Perlin generator to create infinite assortments of music and levels to explore. We use a difficulty level on players to determine how hard each level should be, as the player goes throughout each level they will pick up experience, lives, health, points and attacks. When a player goes to a new level they will take experience, lives and attacks there health and points will be saved to a scoreboard but will be reset in the new level. If you fail to complete a level your difficulty rate will drop, but if you succeed and advance to a new level the difficulty rate you play will increase. Your final level points and health will help determine how much difficulty you will gain. Enemy's are also scored under a difficulty rating, its not often that you will fight higher level enemy's. Please remember that DarkNote is early in development, some features, textures and game systems may change.











Infinite randomly generated music
Infinite randomly generated levels
Multiplayer
Player has a difficulty level
Achievements
Scoreboard
Checkpoints system
Health, lives & points
Selectable attacks (found in levels)
Low system requirements 
Dynamic and static lighting

Full API for modders 

Save & load system
Inventory system for keys and attacks
Settings and pause screens

Not everything on that list is fully complete, we plan on adding all of them during the campaign or shortly after.


   


DarkNote was conceived as an adaptation of Matthew’s side project FMusic which was never intended to be released. It was a very basic program that had a primitive GUI used to produce random music. During a Skype call Declan was surprised that the music was actually coherent, later while playing a dungeon crawler game he became annoyed with the repetitive music of the game he was playing and instead used FMusic to play music over it. After realising the potential use of this Declan pitched the idea of a dungeon crawler with infinite music and generation and difficulty based on the music to Matthew and development began that day using an old engine Matthew created dubbed “Flounder 2D” Later the name DarkNote was chosen due to its the games, at the time, dark aesthetic and relation to music. Equilibrium Games was also chosen by Declan as “I always liked the word equilibrium, it just sounds cool"".






Creating a game can costs money and distributing/ selling it takes even more. Your money will be put to great use keeping our website and forum up and running. And some will help launch our Steam Greenlight.





















  Out game is very low risk, we have a solid game engine and solid game mechanics already coded, implemented, and working, but we have a few things that could go wrong as listed below.  Random level generation may not work as planed. Multiplayer servers may take longer than planed. 
We will work hard to overcome these obstacles and complete DarkNote with our promised features! The last risk is if you select a high level perk with lower level perks included that have been filled you will not receive them.







To run DarkNote these are the minimum system requirements:


500 megabytes (MB's) of free system ram
100 megabytes (MB's) of free hard drive space
Java 1.5 and above
Windows XP, Ubuntu 10.04 (Most linux releases will work), Mac OS X 10.4
Internet access (for multiplayer)
1080 x 720 resolution monitor or larger for good gameplay


(These requirements are subject to change as DarkNote grows it may require more / less.)

At times, Alfie will come across places that he can't reach. That's where Vincenzo comes in, who can jump higher and glide in the air.

During his journeys, Alfie will have to deal with common enemies that will try to crush him, shoot him down and run him over, among other things.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Since 2006, Otherworld Miniatures has been producing 28mm fantasy miniatures for gamers, painters and collectors, inspired by the iconic imagery of the early roleplaying games.  So far, we have just made the monsters, and with a range of nearly 400 creatures in our catalogue, we think that the time has come to introduce some player character models.</p>
<p>We could grow the range slowly, making a couple of figures a month for a few years, but we’d really like to be able to release a substantial range into the marketplace from the start.  Unfortunately, the costs of such a project are significant, so we’re asking for your help.  With the aid of our backers, we plan to release this range, initially with a boxed set of 12 Human adventurers, quickly followed by sets of demi-humans, female adventurers and hirelings and henchmen, over the course of the next few months.  The range of boxed sets will be complemented by individual blister-packs featuring variant models with different armour, weapon and equipment options.</p>
<p>The figures will be sculpted by a variety of talented sculptors, including Kevin Adams and Patrick Keith, with others joining the project later.  The miniatures will depict archetypal fantasy adventurers, human and demi-human, male and female, wearing practical clothing and armour and carrying realistic weapons and equipment. They will be posed for exploration, not combat.  And these characters won’t be muscle-bound superheroes waving Vorpal Swords in the air - they’ll be grim-faced dungeoneers, a little bit down on their luck, and ready for action on your table-top!</p>
<p>The 4 initial boxed sets will be:</p>
<p><strong>DAB1 – Dungeon Adventurers I – Human Male Characters</strong> (planned release – January 2013)</p>
<ul>
<li>Fighter in Plate Mail, with Bastard Sword &amp; Torch</li>

 We’re delighted to show you the second miniatures range we’ve developed 
on 3D for our studio. Thanks to this platform we are glad to show you 
our creations and would like to know your thoughts on them. We hope you 
like them as much as we’ve enjoyed developing them.Valkyries Team is made up by a group of nordic female warriors. In it there are diverse kinds of Valkyries that represent the diverse roles in a Fantasy Football match. We’ve prepared several stretch goals that will add to the team as the campaign develops.The idea came to us when Sukubus Team campaign finished. The feedback from backers was amazing and thanks for their support, encourage us to continue producing Fantasy Football Teams. For this occasion we decided to do something different again, and continue to offer alternative quality miniatures. We would like to point out that miniatures of the Valkyries Team will be slightly higher than the Sukubus Team.Production will be made in high quality resin on a 32mm scale. We’re certain of the finishing of each miniature, as they will be made by our friends at RN Estudio, great professionals that have a lot of experience in this kind of campaigns.This counter is an exclusive gift for this campaign. Each backer will 
receive only one counter per package or one per each complete team in 
case that you order more than one.We want to offer the best quality for our backers. That's why we have managed to make the production of Valkyries Dices with Chessex. A great customized dices company that get the best results. Hungry Troll has made these awesome bases to complete the Valkyries

</div><p><span>Hey, everyone, I am Sergey Lipskiy. Fans of game console emulation know me as “Gonetz”, the main developer of “Glide64”, an open-source graphics plugin for N64 emulators. The Glide64 project was created in 2001 and was initially designed for exclusive use on 3dfx graphics hardware through its proprietary graphics API “Glide3X”, thus the plugin’s name. It was not until later when it got OpenGL support and became available to all PC users. I worked on that project for 10 years. The plugin became very popular thanks to its high compatibility and good support of high-resolution textures. I released the final official version in 2012, but thanks to its open-source nature the project is still not dead. It is included as main or secondary graphics plugin in distributions of many N64 emulators. Thus, if you are familiar with N64 emulation, you should know about Glide64’s capabilities.</span></p><p>The emulation level achieved by Glide64 is very high, but still far from complete. I could not push it forward due to primordial limitations of its architecture. In 2013 I started a new graphics plugin project. The goal of that experimental project is to convert Glide64 features using the power of modern OpenGL and to support features which were impossible to emulate before. The project has no intersection with Glide64 by source code, but it is not made from scratch either. Old open source OpenGL graphics plugin named “glN64” designed by developer with the nickname of “Orkin” was chosen as the basis for my new project. I named the project “GLideN64” to underline its origin and to emphasize the spiritual link with my previous project. Please visit my blog<a href=""http://gliden64.blogspot.ru/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><a href=""http://gliden64.blogspot.ru/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> http://gliden64.blogspot.ru/</a><a href=""http://gliden64.blogspot.ru/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a> dedicated to the project. Here you will find technical details as well as screenshots and videos made with this new plugin.</p>The GLideN64 project started as a hobby. I spent my free time on it and achieved results unreachable with other similar plugins. However, the project remains in alpha stage, unusable for end users. To bring it to the new level I need to spend much more time on it. I call you to support me and fund several months of full-time work on this project. The project aims to provide to the public free of charge the most advanced N64 graphics plugin, with the full source code available under GPL. This is purely a non-commercial, non-profit project. This crowdfunding will just allow me to spend the time to finish it.<div>
<br/><div>
<h3>Working prototype</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p><span>GLideN64 is currently compatible with all emulators which support Zilmar’s plugins specification, that is present in all top N64 emulators. GLideN64 is also compatible with Mupen64Plus 2.0, which has its own plugin specification. Supported OSes are: MS Windows 7-8, Linux 32 and 64 bit. System requirements are: graphics card with support of OpenGL 4.2 or better. GLideN64 is also being ported to the Android OS, however the Android version is less functional. System requirements for Android: OS version 4.0 or above, OpenGL ES 2.0 support, fast CPU. The demo video shows desktop version of the plugin in action.</span></p>
<div>
<h3><span>Visual examples</span></h3> <p></p>
</div>
<span>As I said, the plugin is in alpha stage and is inappropriate for public release. In this section I will show you some high-res screenshots, so you will be able to estimate its potential.</span>

<h3><span>Plan for Project Completion</span></h3>
<p><span>If you love emulation you know how that an ideal graphics plugin must be:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stable</p></li>
<li><p>Fast</p></li>
<li><p>Support all games</p></li>
<li><p>Provide perfect picture</p></li>
<li><p>Have little-to-none settings</p></li>
<li><p>Free to use</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to bring GLideN64 as close to ideal as possible. I see the project ready for public release if the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It works as stable as the emulators which use it</p></li>
<li><p>It has no performance problems</p></li>
<li><p>It has a functional and easy-to-use user interface</p></li>
<li><p>It has a compatibility level similar to the top N64 Graphics plugins</p></li>
<li><p>It supports texture enhancement mechanisms, like SAE</p></li>
<li><p>It supports load of high-resolution textures</p></li>
<li><p>It supports Windows and Linux</p></li>
<li><p>Plugin’s unique features are well polished</p></li>
<li><p>Source code is clean, free and open-source, licensed under the GPL</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of this needs to be implemented. Due to my experience in graphics plugins development I can quite precisely estimate the amount of time necessary to fulfill the requirements listed above. Three months of full-time (8-10 hours/day) work is the bare minimum.</p>
<p>The basic time-line for this process:</p>
<p>October 2014:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fix stability issues</p></li>
<li><p>Implement missing functionality to achieve compatibility equivalent to Glide64. glN64 was released 10 years ago and even then it was not the most compatible plugin. Lots of work here.</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><p>November 2014:</p>
<ul><li><p>Add texture enhancement and hi-res texture load. </p></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><p>I plan to rewrite the GlideHQ submodule from the Glide64 project to add OpenGL texture formats.</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of work need to be done in the plugin to support all the features of GlideHQ.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>December 2014:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Portable user interface</p></li>
<li><p>Support for game specific profiles</p></li>
<li><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Establish a bug-list</span><br/></p></li>
<li><p>Rearrange support forum</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fixes</p></li>
<li><p>Writing docs</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><p>January 2015:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a GitHub repository for the source code.</p></li>
<li><p>Go live!</p></li>
</ul>

Hey, everyone, I am Sergey Lipskiy. Fans of game console emulation know me as “Gonetz”, the main developer of “Glide64”, an open-source graphics plugin for N64 emulators. The Glide64 project was created in 2001 and was initially designed for exclusive use on 3dfx graphics hardware through its proprietary graphics API “Glide3X”, thus the plugin’s name. It was not until later when it got OpenGL support and became available to all PC users. I worked on that project for 10 years. The plugin became very popular thanks to its high compatibility and good support of high-resolution textures. I released the final official version in 2012, but thanks to its open-source nature the project is still not dead. It is included as main or secondary graphics plugin in distributions of many N64 emulators. Thus, if you are familiar with N64 emulation, you should know about Glide64’s capabilities.The emulation level achieved by Glide64 is very high, but still far from complete. I could not push it forward due to primordial limitations of its architecture. In 2013 I started a new graphics plugin project. The goal of that experimental project is to convert Glide64 features using the power of modern OpenGL and to support features which were impossible to emulate before. The project has no intersection with Glide64 by source code, but it is not made from scratch either. Old open source OpenGL graphics plugin named “glN64” designed by developer with the nickname of “Orkin” was chosen as the basis for my new project. I named the project “GLideN64” to underline its origin and to emphasize the spiritual link with my previous project. Please visit my blog  http://gliden64.blogspot.ru/ dedicated to the project. Here you will find technical details as well as screenshots and videos made with this new plugin.The GLideN64 project started as a hobby. I spent my free time on it and achieved results unreachable with other similar plugins. However, the project remains in alpha stage, unusable for end users. To bring it to the new level I need to spend much more time on it. I call you to support me and fund several months of full-time work on this project. The project aims to provide to the public free of charge the most advanced N64 graphics plugin, with the full source code available under GPL. This is purely a non-commercial, non-profit project. This crowdfunding will just allow me to spend the time to finish it.

Working prototype 

GLideN64 is currently compatible with all emulators which support Zilmar’s plugins specification, that is present in all top N64 emulators. GLideN64 is also compatible with Mupen64Plus 2.0, which has its own plugin specification. Supported OSes are: MS Windows 7-8, Linux 32 and 64 bit. System requirements are: graphics card with support of OpenGL 4.2 or better. GLideN64 is also being ported to the Android OS, however the Android version is less functional. System requirements for Android: OS version 4.0 or above, OpenGL ES 2.0 support, fast CPU. The demo video shows desktop version of the plugin in action.

Visual examples 

As I said, the plugin is in alpha stage and is inappropriate for public release. In this section I will show you some high-res screenshots, so you will be able to estimate its potential.


“Mario Tennis”. A lot of frame buffer effects are used here, e.g. dynamic shadows for all characters, score board, ball’s trace etc.


“Mario Tennis”. Beautiful replay with motion blur effect.


“Beetle Adventure Racing!” Slide film effect.


“Beetle Adventure Racing!”. Depth buffer based fog implemented using capabilities of modern hardware. Environmental reflection on the car: frame buffer effect.


“The Legend of Zelda, Majora's Mask” Correct emulation of Lens Of Truth, with snowflakes not cut outside the lens. Frame buffer and depth buffer emulation.



“Perfect Dark”. Frame buffer effect: CamSpy.


“Extreme-G”. Complex depth compare mode emulated.


“Banjo-Tooie” Frame buffer effects: dynamic shadow, reflection in the bubble.


Plan for Project Completion
If you love emulation you know how that an ideal graphics plugin must be:

Stable
Fast
Support all games
Provide perfect picture
Have little-to-none settings
Free to use

The goal is to bring GLideN64 as close to ideal as possible. I see the project ready for public release if the following conditions are met:

It works as stable as the emulators which use it
It has no performance problems
It has a functional and easy-to-use user interface
It has a compatibility level similar to the top N64 Graphics plugins
It supports texture enhancement mechanisms, like SAE
It supports load of high-resolution textures
It supports Windows and Linux
Plugin’s unique features are well polished
Source code is clean, free and open-source, licensed under the GPL

All of this needs to be implemented. Due to my experience in graphics plugins development I can quite precisely estimate the amount of time necessary to fulfill the requirements listed above. Three months of full-time (8-10 hours/day) work is the bare minimum.
The basic time-line for this process:
October 2014:

Fix stability issues
Implement missing functionality to achieve compatibility equivalent to Glide64. glN64 was released 10 years ago and even then it was not the most compatible plugin. Lots of work here.

November 2014:
Add texture enhancement and hi-res texture load. 

I plan to rewrite the GlideHQ submodule from the Glide64 project to add OpenGL texture formats.
Lots of work need to be done in the plugin to support all the features of GlideHQ.

December 2014:

Portable user interface
Support for game specific profiles
Establish a bug-list
Rearrange support forum
Bug fixes
Writing docs

January 2015:

Establish a GitHub repository for the source code.
Go live!

Everything mentioned above can be accomplished if necessary fund is collected. What if more is collected? In this case I will be able to continue the project with full efforts:

If 8,000 USD are collected I will be able to complete the Android port. The current Android build works quite slow and has many glitches which desktop builds have not. Android debugging is a tedious process, plus some investment in Android devices with different graphics chips may be necessary.
10,000+ USD will allow me to spend time on experimental and user-demanded features like port to Apple Mac OS X, advanced Anti-aliasing, widescreen hack, rendering in native resolution and other nice features which I never had enough time to implement.




Risks & Challenges  
Of course, there is always the possibility for snags with any creative project. Things can go wrong, take longer to complete than expected, etc. But I promise that even if I get out of schedule and funds run out before I complete everything I planned the plugin will be released in functional state, because I will focus on the critical for release features first. The project will be released with sources and I will continue to work on it as on my favorite hobby.

Whenever a prop breaks, it leaves a small message to the player in memorium, often in the form of a terrible pun. Check out our tiers for the option to grab your own personalized flavor text. We'll have a lot more props in the final game as well. 
 


Affectionately named ‘Pawl’ for short, he’s the ectoplasm hairball here to haunt you. He leaves interdimensional hairballs on the carpet. He leaves rifts in the furniture. And if you don't get rid of him, he'll possess your stuff quicker than a bad foreclosure.
 
GAME FEATURES
 


Extremely dangerous, highly explosive potions that you promised to clean up but never did. Especially the ones teetering dangerously close to the edge of tables. Picking up two of a like color has a combo effect.
 

Red + Red = Set Pawl ablaze! 
Causes damage continuously in addition to props for five seconds. 
 

Yellow + Yellow = 2X Damage! 
Props count for double for the next five seconds! 
 

Blue + Blue = Slow Motion! 
Makes you feel awake, makes Pawl feel max pain, slows the entire world down for five seconds. 
 
We're working on a few more combinations and possibly a fourth color, stay tuned! 
 

 
Using your device's gyroscope, your screen becomes a window into the game environment. Utilizing the iPhone and iPad to the fullest, Pawtergeist’s controls are entirely gyroscopically driven, with options to increase or decrease sensitivity for the best possible experience. Yes, you can play while sitting down! You won't even have to fight for the arm rest. 
 


 
Oh yes, there's hats!
Pawl will wear a random item each time the game is played. Some are there from the beginning, some are unlocked. All are fashionable.

We want to present all that in this project - Zhelter.  Zhelter was started March 2019.The first step was to build a prototype, proving the basics of the game style and art style. The prototype was greatly and positively received at a recent game festival, with actual players very excited about this project. That was motivation enough to continue developing this project. However, we need more time and resources for the 1.0 build stage. We need your help.   2019 G-Star    You can meet Zhelter at Steam Early Access first. We are currently focused to running smoothly on Windows. We're a small team. We want to fully focus on Windows(Steam), instead of multiple platforms at once and being unfocused.   Steam Early Access enables you to sell a game on Steam while it is still being developed and provides context to customers that a product should be considered ""unfinished."" Early Access is a place for games that are in a playable alpha or beta state, are worth the current value of the playable build, and that you plan to continue to develop for release.Releasing a game in Early Access helps set context for prospective customers and provides them with information about your plans and goals before a ""final"" release.  For those of you who do decide to support our project, it would means a lot to us. We want to thank you with these rewards.   * Design patches, stickers, and Zippo lighter designs will be released soon.* The design of merchandise rewards has not been finalized yet. Please note that it is subject to be changed.

<p>On his
journey to the ""Other Side"" Reader (and his ""natural
companion"" Writer) meets various Ghosts and Demons, Holy Spirits and Gods.
He also meets Singer, who is neither Ghost, nor Demon. At some point she
becomes important to Reader.
Realizing this won't stop him though.</p>
<p>The world
of Ghostdream should be scary, but it is not - it is just dark. The story
should be sad since all the characters are more or less dead, but it is not,
because they normally remember nothing, except some minor detail or two (for
example the protagonist remembers himself reading a book - this is why they
call him Reader. It is his only memory after all). <br/></p>
<p>Ghostdream is a
retro-style Point and Click Adventure game with puzzles, exploration and story.</p>

<li>


55+ entirely animated locations
(rooms)</li>
<li>14+ characters</li>

less Myst style: no items required, exploration of the whole accessible area is

<li>16 000+ words story</li>
<li>20 songs OST </li>

about 10 hours to beat Ghostdream for the first time (not including the already
mentioned optional secrets here).</li>

<h4>General Situation/State Of The Project</h4>
<p></p>
<p>At the
moment more than 50% of the whole game is done and eventually it will be
finished in one way or the other. Naturally with some financial help it will
become slightly bigger, slightly better, with slightly more extra content. My
problem is – I’m broke. I have no idea how to get money remaining an artist and I have no idea how to remain an artist doing something else. I won't deny though - I am a horrible businessman. My relationship with money is always full of drama and suspense. <br/></p>
<p>Honestly, I
don’t believe in the success of this campaign – making a game is one thing,
promoting a campaign for the said game is a completely different thing I have no time for. But my
strategy is “try everything that is legal”. Not like I have a lot of choice
here. Yes, it would be awesome to have a successfully crowd-funded project on IGG – I would be able to concentrate on the game entirely. But I believe I’m mentally prepared for any result. <br/></p>
<p>I’m quite
brilliant regardless of anything. I just need some money to maintain the
brilliance.</p>

On his
journey to the ""Other Side"" Reader (and his ""natural
companion"" Writer) meets various Ghosts and Demons, Holy Spirits and Gods.
He also meets Singer, who is neither Ghost, nor Demon. At some point she
becomes important to Reader.
Realizing this won't stop him though.
The world
of Ghostdream should be scary, but it is not - it is just dark. The story
should be sad since all the characters are more or less dead, but it is not,
because they normally remember nothing, except some minor detail or two (for
example the protagonist remembers himself reading a book - this is why they
call him Reader. It is his only memory after all). 
Ghostdream is a
retro-style Point and Click Adventure game with puzzles, exploration and story.





Features/Stats




55+ entirely animated locations
(rooms)
14+ characters
7 Major Puzzles (more or
less Myst style: no items required, exploration of the whole accessible area is
a must) + standard adventure actions (like get here, talk there, press this,
press that...)


10+ Optional Secrets
16 000+ words story
20 songs OST 
It’s hard
to calculate how long an adventure game can last, but I believe it will take
about 10 hours to beat Ghostdream for the first time (not including the already
mentioned optional secrets here).
PC Windows exclusively. 

Ultimately digital.

General Situation/State Of The Project

At the
moment more than 50% of the whole game is done and eventually it will be
finished in one way or the other. Naturally with some financial help it will
become slightly bigger, slightly better, with slightly more extra content. My
problem is – I’m broke. I have no idea how to get money remaining an artist and I have no idea how to remain an artist doing something else. I won't deny though - I am a horrible businessman. My relationship with money is always full of drama and suspense. 
Honestly, I
don’t believe in the success of this campaign – making a game is one thing,
promoting a campaign for the said game is a completely different thing I have no time for. But my
strategy is “try everything that is legal”. Not like I have a lot of choice
here. Yes, it would be awesome to have a successfully crowd-funded project on IGG – I would be able to concentrate on the game entirely. But I believe I’m mentally prepared for any result. 
I’m quite
brilliant regardless of anything. I just need some money to maintain the
brilliance.


You can see a lot of screenshots in the gallery above. If there will be any interest at all I may add more stuff in the updates. Here you can see some additional concept arts:

Reader meets Singer in an outer space between Ghost World and the Other Side...


Organ Grinder's head. ""Red mass"" signifies she's a demon. 


Perfect umbrella. Concept Art for the ""Other Side"". (UP: When I was trying to upload this picture with my update 2 IndieGoGo has deformed it once again making it unreasonably smaller, so I re-upload it here. Surprisingly it looks normal on the main page.(Reader's friend - Writer. He believes he's the protagonist and Reader is his ""sidekick"".(The villain - Actor, Each time he appears he wears different masks - first two masks are quite normal as you can see... the rest - not as much...(If Reader would have a ""love interest"" it would be Singer, but since the concept of love is laughably pointless for a ghost they simply talk once in a while...I wanted to put some nicely looking little players here from SoundCloud, but IndieGoGo doesn't allow me to do this.

<h3>One more reason to care :</h3>
<p>There is a large pool of 25 - 40 year old talent who, for many reasons (children, bad luck, wrong city), are out there working min-wage jobs living paycheck to paycheck... or even unemployed due to cutbacks... who have the chops to make it professionally.

<p>We want the company to have a portfolio of works, not hedge all bets on one title! Plus, if you actually look at what Great Apes proposes, it's pretty much ""as good as it gets"" for iOS.

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Final Right also incorporates elements of modern gaming (random loot, repeatable dungeon instances with scalable difficulties), and integrates a third button to the standard 2 button action-arcade controls.</p>
<p>This third button adds a <strong>Switch Equipment</strong> capability to the already familiar <strong>Attack</strong> and <strong>Jump</strong> functions. In Final Right, players will be able to have 3 sets of equipment they will be able to actively switch in game, at any time.</p>
<p>The game also introduces a kind of super meter to the genre, which is filled by damaging enemies. Once the meter is filled, and all 3 buttons are pressed, FINAL RIGHT mode is engaged. During FINAL RIGHT mode, the player can perform moves normally unavailable. Once engaged, the FINAL RIGHT meter ticks down, slowly. Once empty, the player returns to normal and the meter can be filled again.</p>
<p>By chaining together combos while in FINAL RIGHT mode, and switching weapon sets during combos, the player is able to customize their play style any way they choose.</p>
<p>Individual armor pieces and each weapon found will have extended capabilities, which will have various effects such as the helmet adding to the players speed (20% during FINAL RIGHT), or the left gauntlet increasing drop chances (+5% gold or rare drop at all times).</p>

</div></div>","What is ARCHAIC SOULS?

""Archaic Souls is a dream studio, our canvas is phosphors and our paint is light.""
We've been wanting to make video games for a long time, and now that the market is opened up, it is more than a possibility. It's a certainty! No more wondering if you're going to get picked up by a publisher, you can publish on your own, direct to consumer!
 
Who am I, and why can *I* make this happen?
I am a 34-year-old producer with experience in the gaming industry. Due to NDAs and things of that sort, I cannot discuss projects that I have worked on.

 
I just received my degree in Communications (TV/Film/PR/Marketing) with a minor in Global Business (entrepreneurship, the way money works, etc) from the University of Houston (go coogs!) I graduated with honors, taking 6 classes my last semester and getting a perfect 4.0 that same semester.
 
I am a guy who ""gets things done"" (singlehandedly, if need be).
I have already released an Xbox Live Indie Game called Punch THAT Face, completed within a month, and completely created (all graphics, all sounds, all programming) by me. Think of what can be done with a budget and a team!
I have built and repaired Arcade Machines for a living, from the ground up, board to monitor.
I have been running, updating, and building the Geeks And Dorks (.com) brand name for 5 1/2 years.
Now, under the moniker of Archaic Souls, I want to begin to produce low cost, high quality Indie titles (""indie"" meaning independent and self-published games, not attached to a big name distribution house).

Why should you donate?


Being as indie as we are, that means we have no initial budget.

A studio like ours means we NEED support from a crowdfunding platform to get started! We have no means from Traditional Finance Houses, so it's up to the true Private Sector (you) to become the real job creators in this economy!
 
Since none of us live in California (I live in Houston, artists in Washington State, programmer and music/sound are in Texas), our expenditures are low. Without the bloated costs of running a big-name studio, the costs to produce this game only include those costs which keep this production talent alive!
With the initial funding goal, the team will consist of 2 1/2 people : 

Producer / Design Lead / Programmer - Jason Chase

Lead Artist / Character Designer / UI Design - Matt Thew

A second Programmer part-time - TBA

With our goal, we'll be able to put forth 2 & 1/2 full-time efforts on these projects, making the projects as professionally created as it gets! (instead of as much as we can do in our free time!)

If we extend beyond our goal, we'll be able to add more people to the team, making the games even greater with each milestone achieved!
With each extra $5k, we're able to add some really awesome features, and some most excellent people:

@ $20,000 : We add a dedicated Sound / Music duo, enhancing the games by 50%!
Great Apes Content Pack 2 (3 more characters, 30 new stages, 5 new backgrounds, and 2 new weapons) will be free! (estimated release : APR, 2014)
Final Right Content Pack 2 (more weapons, armor, skills, and 2 more end-game areas) will be free! (estimated release : FEB, 2014)

<h3>     You take control of one of six factions in the criminal underworld. The aim of the game is to take down the other criminal organiztions while also defending your own and running businesses on the side to make money. This is a tower defense/money management game where each decision you make has a consequence. This game is known for its unique take on rules. Besides the basic instructions on how to play the game, every choice you make is up to you. You make work together with other players to take down an opponent, or act as a lone wolf. You may trade cards with other players and make deals such as truces. Any deal made though may be broken and players can be backstabed and betrayed, as is the life of a criminal. You can play dirty, or you can play clean. In the end though you must do whatever it takes to survive and become the last criminal organization standing.</h3>

<h3>The next thing the money will be going towards is the perks. As you donate money you will be given perks, such as an exclusive T-Shirt or the board game itself.

<h3>The indiegogo fee. Whether I make my goal or not indiegogo takes a percentage of the money I make to keep the website running. The fee falls between 4% and 9% of the money I make.</h3>

If you aren't familiar with either of those titles then picture this game as a money management/tower defense board game. You control a criminal organization; one of six. For example there is the Italian Mafia, American Motorcycle Club, and a Japanese Crime Syndicate. Your objective is to take down the other players and be the last criminal organization standing. You do this by playing defense cards to guard your headquarters and offense cards to attack the headquarters of other players. There are also currency and item cards which you use to obtain money. Money is important because it is needed to play any offense or defense cards. There are also Business and Service cards. Business cards generate money each round for you but also need defense cards to remain safe. Service cards provide special abilities for the players and cost a large amount of money. Abilities such as playing two extra cards in a turn or repairing your headquarters or a business. You can even make another player lose a turn. It is a simple game that allows you to play however you'd like. Making for a unique experience everytime you play. Make truces with others players or act as a lone wolf. Whatever gets you to the end.</h3>

</div></div>","You take control of one of six factions in the criminal underworld. The aim of the game is to take down the other criminal organiztions while also defending your own and running businesses on the side to make money. This is a tower defense/money management game where each decision you make has a consequence. This game is known for its unique take on rules. Besides the basic instructions on how to play the game, every choice you make is up to you. You make work together with other players to take down an opponent, or act as a lone wolf. You may trade cards with other players and make deals such as truces. Any deal made though may be broken and players can be backstabed and betrayed, as is the life of a criminal. You can play dirty, or you can play clean. In the end though you must do whatever it takes to survive and become the last criminal organization standing.



So here is the breakdown of what the money will be used on.


The images used on the cards are from a fantastic website www.shutterstock.com. I don't yet have the rights to display these images on my cards. In order to attain these rights it will cost me $250. I will then be able to sell this board game online.


The next thing the money will be going towards is the perks. As you donate money you will be given perks, such as an exclusive T-Shirt or the board game itself. These things cost money so in order to make sure I have enough money to license the images I need to take perk costs into account.


The indiegogo fee. Whether I make my goal or not indiegogo takes a percentage of the money I make to keep the website running. The fee falls between 4% and 9% of the money I make.


Any extra money that I gain from this campaign I will put towards the development of the first expansion deck for this game. The deck will feature new offense and defense cards. It will also go towards the marketing of my board game so more people can hear about it.





There are eight different perk levels:
Perk One/$5 (Soldier) - A donation in this amount would be greatly appreciated and would immensely help the production to this game. 

Perk Two/$10 (Lieutenant) - The last page of the instructional booklet will be dedicated to those who have funded this project. This donation amount will get your name featured on the Funded By page.

Perk Three/$15 (Capo) - Get your name on the Funded By page. Also send in a picture of yourself to be featured next to your name on the Funded By page, that way no one can doubt that it is you that contributed to the creation of this game. Of course if you would rather have no picture just let me know.

Perk Four/$25 (Consiglieri) - Get your name on the Funded By page. Place a picture of yourself beside your name and for this donation amount I will place your twitter handle below your name that way anyone who purchases the game may also follow you. Again your picture and twitter handle don't have to be included.

Perk Five/$50 (Underboss) - Get your name on the Funded By page. Place a picture of yourself beside your name. Get your twitter handle beneath your name and get a criminal underworld poker deck. A full 54 card deck including jokers.

Perk Six/$75 (Boss) - Get your name on the Funded By page. Place a picture of yourself beside your name. Get your twitter handle beneath your name. Get a Criminal Underworld poker deck. At this donation point you finally get the game itself to play with your friends. Get the Criminal Underworld board game.

Perk Seven/$100 (Crime Lord) - Get your name on the Funded By page. Place a picture of yourself beside your name. Get your twitter handle beneath your name. Get a Criminal Underworld poker deck. Get the Criminal Underworld board game. You also get an exclusive Crime Lord T-Shirt that is available nowhere else other than this indiegogo campaign.

<p><img alt=""Bauwerk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.yodagames.de/indiegogo/logo.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;""/>My name is Yoda. Read more about me below. The game BAUWERK is a strategic building board-game I created and produced some time ago in a limited edition of 150 pieces, and it's already sold out. The only drawback in the first edition was, that it was quite tiny-sized. The game-board was on the back-side of the box and it measured only around 6"" by 8"". Due to it's popularity, I want to create an improved 2nd edition now. Read here what the game is about ...</p>
<h2>Bauwerk - The game</h2>
<p><img alt=""Connect your plot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.yodagames.de/indiegogo/connect.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;""/>Bauwerk is a two-player strategic-building game. It features a game-board with two different colors of territory for the two players. Goal is to connect all your plots with each other, by building a path that leads from one field to the others. You do this by placing blocks and connecting the blocks with sticks. Actually you are building bridges. The point is, the more blocks a bridge has, the higher score it counts. And, a direct connection counts more than an indicrect, i.e. one that has branches in it. Also, you can place the blocks in three ways:</p>
<p><img alt=""Three levels of building"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.yodagames.de/indiegogo/levels.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;""/>Flat, sideways or upright, thus creating three levels of height for building the bridges. The higher the level, the higher the score. And you gain extra-score for creating bridges over others and paths under others. The scoring-system is very cleverly made and it creates a lot of challenge in placing the blocks and bridges, while trying to score as many points as possibe. Did I mention that, the more territory you have already built on, the less material you get for the next building-round?</p>
<h2>Bauwerk - 2nd Edition</h2>
<p><img alt=""Bauwerk The Game"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.yodagames.de/indiegogo/fullgame.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; vertical-align: baseline;""/></p>
<p>I want to make a second edition of this great game, with a nice and big game-board sized 16"" x 12"", really beautiful playing-material and an attractive professional box and instruction-booklet. Since I'm creating games since more than 20 years, I know exactly what is needed and how to do it. The first edition of the game already proved it's quality and fun gameplay, so the second edition will be even better with the bigger size and professional packaging. My plan is to re-design the full game, with a theme like San Francisco Bay or Roman Aquaeduct, the actual theme has to be decided for and a professional graphics-artist will be hired to design the game-board and box-art when the funding-goal is reached.</p>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>The money will be used for design-work, ordering the game-parts, producing the game-boards and the boxes. It goes into the final game, that you will recieve as your perk. Here's what will happen exactly and what you will get:</p>
<p>When the first goal is reached, the second edition can be produced in the desired quality - wooden playing material, a big gameboard and a professionally made game-box together with a full-color instruction-booklet in German and English. Each supporter will get his perks, which includes the copies of the final game. You will have a lot of fun with that!</p>
<h2>The Perks</h2>
<h3>Perk #1 - Surprise-Postcard &amp; Code (5.- EUR)</h3>
<p>We will print surprise-postcards with designs from the game and send them to you by snail-mail. Worldwide shipping is already included. On the postcard, there will be a scratch-field that reveals a discount-code for ordering games on the Yodagames-website. With this code, you may order the finished BAUWERK game after release for a discounted price, or you may even order other games. The discount will be valid for any games you like.</p>
<h3>Perk #2 - Website-Memorial (10.- EUR)</h3>
<p>You will get the postcard as explained above, plus we will put your name in the list of supporters on the website of the game.</p>
<h3>Perk #3 - Soundtrack CD (20.- EUR)</h3>
<p>You will get a full CD of Brainwater's Techno Tracks, including a full-length version of the one in the Bauwerk-video. All these tracks are personally made by me, Yoda. Worldwide shipping included.</p>

<h2>Update #1</h2>
<p>It looks like it's not exactly clear why this game is so interesting and fun to play. So I decided to upload the whole instructions (of the recent version) so you can understand it fully and see the tricky part: You have to build as much and as fast as possible in order to finish first and take the space before the other player takes it, but at the same time, the more you build, the less material you get in the next round, so you have to plan carefully where and how you build. And, of course it's tricky and needs good skill to place the roads on the blocks perfectly, otherwise you miss a lot of distance or get penalty if something is falling down. So here are the complete instructions, English and German:</p>
<p><img alt=""English Instructions of Bauwerk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.yodagames.de/indiegogo/ine.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""English Instructions of Bauwerk""/></p>
<p><img alt=""Deutsche Anleitung von Bauwerk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.yodagames.de/indiegogo/ind.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Deutsche Anleitung von Bauwerk""/></p></div>","Bauwerk - 1st Edition
My name is Yoda. Read more about me below. The game BAUWERK is a strategic building board-game I created and produced some time ago in a limited edition of 150 pieces, and it's already sold out. The only drawback in the first edition was, that it was quite tiny-sized. The game-board was on the back-side of the box and it measured only around 6"" by 8"". Due to it's popularity, I want to create an improved 2nd edition now. Read here what the game is about ...
Bauwerk - The game
Bauwerk is a two-player strategic-building game. It features a game-board with two different colors of territory for the two players. Goal is to connect all your plots with each other, by building a path that leads from one field to the others. You do this by placing blocks and connecting the blocks with sticks. Actually you are building bridges. The point is, the more blocks a bridge has, the higher score it counts. And, a direct connection counts more than an indicrect, i.e. one that has branches in it. Also, you can place the blocks in three ways:
Flat, sideways or upright, thus creating three levels of height for building the bridges. The higher the level, the higher the score. And you gain extra-score for creating bridges over others and paths under others. The scoring-system is very cleverly made and it creates a lot of challenge in placing the blocks and bridges, while trying to score as many points as possibe. Did I mention that, the more territory you have already built on, the less material you get for the next building-round?
Bauwerk - 2nd Edition

I want to make a second edition of this great game, with a nice and big game-board sized 16"" x 12"", really beautiful playing-material and an attractive professional box and instruction-booklet. Since I'm creating games since more than 20 years, I know exactly what is needed and how to do it. The first edition of the game already proved it's quality and fun gameplay, so the second edition will be even better with the bigger size and professional packaging. My plan is to re-design the full game, with a theme like San Francisco Bay or Roman Aquaeduct, the actual theme has to be decided for and a professional graphics-artist will be hired to design the game-board and box-art when the funding-goal is reached.
The Goal
The money will be used for design-work, ordering the game-parts, producing the game-boards and the boxes. It goes into the final game, that you will recieve as your perk. Here's what will happen exactly and what you will get:
When the first goal is reached, the second edition can be produced in the desired quality - wooden playing material, a big gameboard and a professionally made game-box together with a full-color instruction-booklet in German and English. Each supporter will get his perks, which includes the copies of the final game. You will have a lot of fun with that!
The Perks
Perk #1 - Surprise-Postcard & Code (5.- EUR)
We will print surprise-postcards with designs from the game and send them to you by snail-mail. Worldwide shipping is already included. On the postcard, there will be a scratch-field that reveals a discount-code for ordering games on the Yodagames-website.

</p>
<p>The NerdQ  launched January 1<sup>st</sup>
this year to create a brand that covered independent video game
development in the midwest. We are gamers just like yourself, and we
want to cover the news of the independent video game culture. Our
focus is niche because it is where we see the most value
occurring—and it's through this we hope to provide the most value
to listeners and developers alike.  With this campaign we want to
raise our base goal of $2000 for equipment and marketing. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For now our sights are set on the upper
Midwest which will be our domain while we operate out of Fargo, ND,
don't ya know. We aim to assist in ushering a golden era for
independent video game development.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Along the way we hope to make key
business partnerships that will help accent our unique flare for
getting the job done. By beginning this movement, we're not only
enriching the gaming industry, but also opening up different avenues
to create value our in local economy; by only endorsing and
generating business with local homegrown taste-makers.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>For this campaign to be successful, we
will need at least $2000, all the funds will go to the purchase of
radio equipment and production; such as microphones, soundboard,
marketing materials, and merchandise. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Everyone who donates to the campaign,
will receive some some form of merchandise—from unique pins to

The NerdQ  launched January 1st
this year to create a brand that covered independent video game
development in the midwest. We are gamers just like yourself, and we
want to cover the news of the independent video game culture. Our
focus is niche because it is where we see the most value
occurring—and it's through this we hope to provide the most value
to listeners and developers alike.  With this campaign we want to
raise our base goal of $2000 for equipment and marketing. 



For now our sights are set on the upper
Midwest which will be our domain while we operate out of Fargo, ND,
don't ya know. We aim to assist in ushering a golden era for
independent video game development.


Along the way we hope to make key
business partnerships that will help accent our unique flare for
getting the job done. By beginning this movement, we're not only
enriching the gaming industry, but also opening up different avenues
to create value our in local economy; by only endorsing and
generating business with local homegrown taste-makers.     What We Need & What You Get 

For this campaign to be successful, we
will need at least $2000, all the funds will go to the purchase of
radio equipment and production; such as microphones, soundboard,
marketing materials, and merchandise. 



Everyone who donates to the campaign,
will receive some some form of merchandise—from unique pins to
limited edition T-shirts. We will be working with local businesses in
the Fargo Moorhead area to provide massive amounts of value through
their services. 



If we don't reach our entire goal, the
funds we do raise will be put toward purchasing immediate needs from
our list of equipment. Anything above our minimum amount, will go
toward us getting studio space for us to operate out of.     The Impact

<h3>A Documentary About Gaming From a Unique Perspective</h3>
<p>In the bowels of Northern New Jersey, a small independent radio station plays hosts to a variety of podcasters, including several stand-up comedians that run a comedy show on the same night that a bunch of gamers have their podcast role-playing night. Passing each other often in the halls of the studio, each clique would eye the other with suspicion and derision; unable to understand just what exactly each was up to. This documentary examines the results when these comedians are asked to sit down and play their very first role-playing game, live, on camera.</p>
<p>And what game did they play, you ask? Why, Fiasco, of course!<br/><br/>While much of the principle photography has already been shot, we're running this campaign to try to raise enough revenue to hire help/rent equipment to streamline the editing process, shoot b-roll, and go on tour to promote the film.</p>
<p>Gaming is still a misunderstood hobby, and we hope that <em>Playing with Comedians</em> will help shed some light in a fun, entertaining, and completely unexpected way!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The project needs funding if we're going to be able to get it out in time for film festivals, not to mention the actual production of a DVD. This will take a little bit of money, but we have some awesome perks for your help:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're offering exclusive copies of the DVD for the finished film</li>
<li>We're offering custom playsets and editions of the Fiasco role-playing game that the comedians played in the film</li>
<li>We're asking our contributors to join us for some comedy shows AND game nights to celebrate the premiere! Yes, you too can play with comedians!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since the dawn of the hobby, rpgs have been misunderstood. Somehow, this form of entertainment is maligned and ridiculed - even by those who, bias aside, would have an awesome time trying it out!</p>
<p>With this film, we want to show gamers how they are viewed by the public, show non-gamers what gaming can really be like, and show everyone a different perspective of looking at their world. We hope you can help!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Because they project is effectively trying to bridge two very different worlds together, we're having issues getting the word out to the right people that may want to support us. Please help get the word out about this incredibly worthy project! Tell your friends, bug your enemies!</p>

<p>The main character is Grom'k, a lonesome warrior destined to become the leader of his tribe which grows as he embarks on more adventures.</p>
<p>A confirmed bachelor, Grom'k will have to adapt to face new challenges, such as feed, defend and grow his tribe. Bel’ana, his future wife, never lets him forget his duties especially when he loses himself daydreaming. Over the course of his various missions  he will discover his destiny and find the ansers his most existential questions.</p>
<p>He will have to go through very varied worlds, from his initial hunting ground to much less reassuring landscapes. He will even uncover complex relations between the bright world of the living and the chilling world of shadows - one of the worlds he will have to find during his quest.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>We’ve finished two games already : </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>- The first chapter of our platform game 'TribeQuest Green Valley’, which showcases Grom'k's adventures.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>- The initial version of the first ‘mini game’ called ‘TribeQuest Red Killer’: a puzzle game containing 40 different levels so far.</span></p>
<p>We’re working with experienced art directors. They are also in charge of establishing the curriculum for ESIA3D school in Lyon. We are working with some of their students.  <br/>Our wishe us to achieve the highest graphical quality in our games that we can possibly get.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The first phase of our projet is completed. We just launched a first version of ‘Green Valley’ and ‘Red Killer’ on MAC and PC.  <br/>We are also launching our own online sales platform with our own distribution technology.</p>
<p>We are now starting the second phase. We’re fixing and enhancing the first chapter of ‘Green Valley’. <br/>We’re finishing a first version of the second chapter and we’ve started the production of the third. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We’re also going to make ‘Red killer’ better and bigger, and we’re developing a second ‘minigame’.</span></p>
<p>In our mind, TribeQuest is a huge project. You’ll be able to play with Grom'k but also a lot of other characters; you’ll get a ton of different gameplays and you’ll follow Grom'k in some incredibles adventures that will get him very, very far away from his starting point.</p>
<p>You’ll also get a lot of ‘side’ games that will extend the TribeQuest universe in many directions...</p>
<p>But for the moment, we start small and slow and we hope that this begining will please you enough to make you want to follow us in our journey.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Dominique Pavlin :</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Dominique started his carrier in 1988 in software engineering. He then created Netquartz, a company developing a software distribution platform primarily for video games and multimedia. He left in 2004 to create IOZO.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Philippe Louvet:</span></h3>
<p>Philippe Louvet: Philippe started his career in video games in 1992 as a game tester for Infogrames. He became a full time employee in 1996 and occupied several roles within the publishing department. After several years as a producer, he left the company (which became Atari in 2002) to become an independant producer.  </p>
<p>Philippe has been involved in the following games :  <strong id=""docs-internal-guid-64bdec84-5b60-6820-69a5-82296bf4c60e""><span><br class=""kix-line-break""/></span><a href=""http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,2606"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,2606</span></a></strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">We make the games we like but we do them for you, which is why we want to work with you to make the best games we can together.</p>
<p>The more help you give us at the start, the more we win in autonomy and independence.  </p>
<p>We want to bring you the best gaming experiences, ones that are interesting, deep and stimulating. That requires more time and effort than working on a small game. No disrespect for those games, we just want to work a bit differently... We could bring our ideas to big publishers, to gain the means to achieve our ambitions, but we would loose our independence and we would not be able to listen to you.</p>
<p>For those willing to make the journey with us, we will include you little by little in the project. We’ll give you access to a forum where we can discuss things together, we’ll present our ideas and talk about them, we’ll make you test our games as we go along. We’ll ask you questions, and we will listen to your answers...</p>
<p><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/784037/pictures/full/20130430060800-05_how.png?1367327286"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">First, we believe that it’s important to ask you to finance phases that will end up in the creation of something concrete. But during those phases, all the parts of our project will keep on moving forward and you will take part, thereby, to the whole.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>First Objective: 0€</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Yes, that's right, this campaign is in a flexible financing mode. This means that we are not setting a minimum of money to start the project. It’s already started and moving along quite well. We already spent a lot of our own money to be where we are and we could continue.  But to do everything we want is taking us a lot of time and now that we have launched a first version of our game, we would like to go a little faster.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For this budget, we are doing :</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A better version of the first chapter of ‘Green Valley’.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A first version of the second chapter of ‘Green Valley’.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A better version of ‘Red Killer’.</span></p>
</li>
</ul><p>If you dig our adventure and are generous, what can we do with more money?</p>
<p>Pretty simple...We start the next phases and we keep our autonomy while involving you.</p>
<h3>Second objective : 20 000€</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">With this budget, we will be able to achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Better versions of what we already released.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A first version of the third chapter of ‘Green Valley’.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A new minigame from the TribeQuest Universe.</span></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Third objective : 50 000€</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">With this budget, we will be able to achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Better versions of what we already released.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Two new minigame from the TribeQuest Universe.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A first version of the fourth and fifth chapter of ‘Green Valley’.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Adding more musics and improvement of our sound design.</span></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Fourth objective : 100 000€</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For this budget, we will do :</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Development of a comic book to tell the stories of Grom'k before and after the events of ‘Green Valley’.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Launch the pre-production of the second episode of TribeQuest.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Development of the Iphone and Android versions of ‘Green Valley’.</span></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Fifth objective : 250 000€</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">With this budget we will be able to develop the second episode of TribeQuest.</p>
<h3>Special Objective : 1500 000 €</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">If a miracle happens and such a budget is raised, that would change the game radically ...</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With this amount, we would increase our team, and we wouldn't have to build the game a little bit at a time. Insteand, we’ll do it less as “indies” and more like we’re used to do, as a “big studio”...  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This means that, from the start, you’ll get a lot more and better gampelay and more varied content.</p>
<p>Also, with this budget, we will directly port the game to console: PS3 and xbox 360 (… and maybe wii if you help us find good ideas for the wiiU...)</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">At IOZO GAMES, we maintain a ‘Sandbox’  where we share our ideas, concepts, drawings and games somtimes, or bits of games.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you’re willing to take part in our adventure, we will invite you to play in our Sandbox. Much more than a simple forum, it will allow you access to tools to give us advice, to help us make decisions, to rate our ideas, concept and even prototypes.</p>
<p>Even though we are protecting our IPs and ideas, we trust you to keep what you see in our Sandbox for yourselves.</p>
<p>Once in this zone, you’ll get access to all its content, without restrictions, we will only ask you to not distribute in any way what you will find there.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""> Imaginez une toute petite planète dans un coin pénard d’une galaxie lointaine... Sur cette planète luxuriante, mais un tantinet dangereuse, vivent des petits êtres primitifs et roudouillards. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Notre Héros s’appelle Grom'k, un guerrier solitaire, qui habite une petite hutte au bord d’un lac. Il se contente de plaisirs simples. Ses journées sont bien réglées, chercher à manger, ... manger, dormir... <br class=""kix-line-break""/>Mais un jour, quelque chose va venir bouleverser sa petite vie tranquille et l’obliger à partir à l’aventure vers des dangers importants. Il va même rencontrer l’amour... <br class=""kix-line-break""/></span></p>
<p>C’est cette histoire que nous allons vous raconter. Mais on ne va pas se contenter de la manière conventionnelle.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Nous allons créer un univers dans lequel nous développerons plusieurs jeux et médias.</span></p>
<p> <strong><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/773877/pictures/full/20130424023113-02_Details.png?1366795877"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Nous avons déjà terminé deux éléments :</p>
<p>Le premier chapitre du Jeu de plateforme ‘TribeQuest: The Green Valley’ qui raconte les aventures de Grom'k.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>La première version du premier ‘mini jeu’ : ‘TribeQuest : Red Killer’ qui est un jeu de puzzle comportant pour le moment une quarantaine de niveaux.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Nous travaillons avec des directeurs artistiques expérimentés. Ils sont également en charge des cursus d’infographie et animation 3D de l’école ESIA 3D à Lyon. Nous travaillons avec certains de leurs étudiants. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Notre volonté est d’avoir, dans nos jeux, la plus grande qualité graphique possible.</span></p>
<p>La première phase du projet est terminée. Nous venons de lancer une première version de ‘Green Valley’ et ‘Red Killer’ sur PC et MAC. Nous avons lancé notre propre plateforme de vente en ligne avec notre propre technologie de distribution.</p>
<p>Nous lançons maintenant la deuxième phase. Nous allons corriger et améliorer le premier chapitre de ‘Green Valley’. <br/>Nous allons aussi finir une première version du deuxième chapitre et attaquer la production du troisième. Nous allons améliorer et ajouter du contenu dans ‘Red Killer’ et nous allons aussi finir une première version d’un autre ‘mini jeu’.</p>
<p>Dans notre esprit, TribeQuest est un projet gigantesque. Vous pourrez jouer avec Grom'k mais aussi plein d’autres personnages. Vous aurez pleins de gameplays différents et vous suivrez Grom'k dans des aventures incroyables qui vont l'emmener très, très loin de son point de départ, à travers des dizaines de niveaux très variés. Vous aurez aussi pleins de jeux secondaires qui vont étendre l'univers de Tribe Quest dans pleins de directions.... </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Mais pour le moment, on commence petit à petit et on espère que le début vous plaira suffisamment pour vous donner envie de nous suivre pas à pas.</span></p>

Pour se doter des moyens nécessaires à la commercialisation de ses productions, le gérant de IOZO a créé une société de distribution en ligne, Play'n Buzz.</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>En 2010, IOZO s'est associée avec Philippe Louvet pour lancer la production du projet 'TribeQuest'.</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">On fait les jeux dont on a envie, mais on les fait pour vous. Donc on veut travailler avec vous pour faire les meilleurs jeux possible, ensemble.</p>
<p>Au plus vous nous aiderez au départ, au plus nous gagnerons en autonomie et indépendance. </p>

Mais pour cela, on a besoin d’y passer un peu plus de temps que pour des jeux plus simples. <br class=""kix-line-break""/>On pourrait aller proposer nos jeux à des éditeurs, pour avoir les moyens de nos ambitions, mais nous perdriions alors notre indépendance et nous ne pourrions plus vous écouter.</span></p>
<p> Pour ceux qui veulent bien se lancer dans l’aventure avec nous, nous allons vous inclure petit à petit dans le projet. On va vous donner accès à un forum où nous pourrons discuter tous ensemble, où on va vous présenter nos idées, où on vous fera tester des bout de nos jeux au fur et à mesure de leur réalisation.

<p> Il nous semble tout d’abord important de vous proposer de financer des phases qui aboutissent à la création de quelque chose de concret. Mais pendant ces phases, toutes les parties du projet vont avancer aussi et vous participerez donc, de fait, à l’ensemble.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""> 1 / Premier objectif : 0€</h3>
<p>Oui, vous avez pu le constater, nous lançons cette campagne de financement en mode flexible, ce qui veut dire que nous ne fixons pas un objectif minimum pour démarrer le projet. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Comme nous l’avons déjà dit, le projet est déjà en bonne voie, nous avons dépensé beaucoup de notre argent personnel pour arriver où nous en sommes et nous avons les moyens de continuer comme ca. <br class=""kix-line-break""/>Mais tout faire nous même prend beaucoup de temps et maintenant que nous avons lancé une première version de nos jeux, nous aimerions aller un peu plus vite.</span></p>

</ul></div>","Hi, here is the English version of our project. The french version is below...Bonjour, pour accéder à la version francaise, cliquer ici FRANCAIS

On a strange, tiny planet, live primitive tribes. They are composed of chubby little creatures fighting for their survival. One of those are of particular interest to us.
The main character is Grom'k, a lonesome warrior destined to become the leader of his tribe which grows as he embarks on more adventures.
A confirmed bachelor, Grom'k will have to adapt to face new challenges, such as feed, defend and grow his tribe. Bel’ana, his future wife, never lets him forget his duties especially when he loses himself daydreaming. Over the course of his various missions  he will discover his destiny and find the ansers his most existential questions.
He will have to go through very varied worlds, from his initial hunting ground to much less reassuring landscapes. He will even uncover complex relations between the bright world of the living and the chilling world of shadows - one of the worlds he will have to find during his quest.
This is the story we’re going to tell you. But we’re not going to do it in the usual manner.  Instead, we’re going to create a universe in which we will develop many games and media.

We’ve finished two games already : 
- The first chapter of our platform game 'TribeQuest Green Valley’, which showcases Grom'k's adventures.
- The initial version of the first ‘mini game’ called ‘TribeQuest Red Killer’: a puzzle game containing 40 different levels so far.
We’re working with experienced art directors. They are also in charge of establishing the curriculum for ESIA3D school in Lyon. We are working with some of their students.  Our wishe us to achieve the highest graphical quality in our games that we can possibly get.
The first phase of our projet is completed. We just launched a first version of ‘Green Valley’ and ‘Red Killer’ on MAC and PC.  We are also launching our own online sales platform with our own distribution technology.
We are now starting the second phase. We’re fixing and enhancing the first chapter of ‘Green Valley’. We’re finishing a first version of the second chapter and we’ve started the production of the third. 
We’re also going to make ‘Red killer’ better and bigger, and we’re developing a second ‘minigame’.
In our mind, TribeQuest is a huge project. You’ll be able to play with Grom'k but also a lot of other characters; you’ll get a ton of different gameplays and you’ll follow Grom'k in some incredibles adventures that will get him very, very far away from his starting point.
You’ll also get a lot of ‘side’ games that will extend the TribeQuest universe in many directions...
But for the moment, we start small and slow and we hope that this begining will please you enough to make you want to follow us in our journey.

IOZO GAMES :
IOZO was created in 2004, primarily to manage development of technologies linked to video games.
In 2009 IOZO started shifting its activity to focus primarily on the creation and development of video games. To get the means to properly distribute its productions, the owner of IOZO created an online distribution company, Play’n Buzz.
In 2010 IOZO collaborated with Philippe Louvet to launch the project ‘TribeQuest’.
Under the direction of Gilles Benois, former artistic director of Eden Studios and current Director of Studies at Esia 3D, the project Tribe Quest was launched.
In  2011 the development of TribeQuest started as well as the creation of technology linked to digital distribution for the Play’n Buzz platform.
List of games that IOZO contributed to: 
- IOZO GAMES Titles : TribeQuest Green valley, TribeQuest Red Killer, Startoonz: Elysez 2012.
Dominique Pavlin :
Dominique started his carrier in 1988 in software engineering. He then created Netquartz, a company developing a software distribution platform primarily for video games and multimedia. He left in 2004 to create IOZO.
Philippe Louvet:
Philippe Louvet: Philippe started his career in video games in 1992 as a game tester for Infogrames. He became a full time employee in 1996 and occupied several roles within the publishing department. After several years as a producer, he left the company (which became Atari in 2002) to become an independant producer.  
Philippe has been involved in the following games :  http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,2606

We make the games we like but we do them for you, which is why we want to work with you to make the best games we can together.
The more help you give us at the start, the more we win in autonomy and independence.  
We want to bring you the best gaming experiences, ones that are interesting, deep and stimulating. That requires more time and effort than working on a small game. No disrespect for those games, we just want to work a bit differently... We could bring our ideas to big publishers, to gain the means to achieve our ambitions, but we would loose our independence and we would not be able to listen to you.
For those willing to make the journey with us, we will include you little by little in the project. We’ll give you access to a forum where we can discuss things together, we’ll present our ideas and talk about them, we’ll make you test our games as we go along. We’ll ask you questions, and we will listen to your answers...

First, we believe that it’s important to ask you to finance phases that will end up in the creation of something concrete. But during those phases, all the parts of our project will keep on moving forward and you will take part, thereby, to the whole.
First Objective: 0€
Yes, that's right, this campaign is in a flexible financing mode. This means that we are not setting a minimum of money to start the project. It’s already started and moving along quite well. We already spent a lot of our own money to be where we are and we could continue.  But to do everything we want is taking us a lot of time and now that we have launched a first version of our game, we would like to go a little faster.
For this budget, we are doing :


A better version of the first chapter of ‘Green Valley’.


A first version of the second chapter of ‘Green Valley’.


A better version of ‘Red Killer’.

If you dig our adventure and are generous, what can we do with more money?
Pretty simple...We start the next phases and we keep our autonomy while involving you.
Second objective : 20 000€
With this budget, we will be able to achieve:


Better versions of what we already released.


A first version of the third chapter of ‘Green Valley’.


A new minigame from the TribeQuest Universe.

Third objective : 50 000€
With this budget, we will be able to achieve:


Better versions of what we already released.


Two new minigame from the TribeQuest Universe.


A first version of the fourth and fifth chapter of ‘Green Valley’.


Adding more musics and improvement of our sound design.

Fourth objective : 100 000€
For this budget, we will do :


Development of a comic book to tell the stories of Grom'k before and after the events of ‘Green Valley’.


Launch the pre-production of the second episode of TribeQuest.


Development of the Iphone and Android versions of ‘Green Valley’.

Fifth objective : 250 000€
With this budget we will be able to develop the second episode of TribeQuest.
Special Objective : 1500 000 €
If a miracle happens and such a budget is raised, that would change the game radically ...
With this amount, we would increase our team, and we wouldn't have to build the game a little bit at a time. Insteand, we’ll do it less as “indies” and more like we’re used to do, as a “big studio”...  
This means that, from the start, you’ll get a lot more and better gampelay and more varied content.
Also, with this budget, we will directly port the game to console: PS3 and xbox 360 (… and maybe wii if you help us find good ideas for the wiiU...)

At IOZO GAMES, we maintain a ‘Sandbox’  where we share our ideas, concepts, drawings and games somtimes, or bits of games.
If you’re willing to take part in our adventure, we will invite you to play in our Sandbox. Much more than a simple forum, it will allow you access to tools to give us advice, to help us make decisions, to rate our ideas, concept and even prototypes.
Even though we are protecting our IPs and ideas, we trust you to keep what you see in our Sandbox for yourselves.
Once in this zone, you’ll get access to all its content, without restrictions, we will only ask you to not distribute in any way what you will find there.

The following is our current planning, it could change depending on the succes of this crowdfunding campaign.
May 2013 :


Launch of the first versions of ‘Green Valley’ and ‘Red Killer’.


Launch of this crowdfunding campaign.


Enhancement of the released versions.

June 2013 :


Release of the second chapter of Green Valley.


End of the Crowdfunding campaign.


Opening of our Sandbox to our benefactors.


Sending of the ‘goodies’.

July 2013 :


Release of the Third Chapter of Green Valley.


Release of the second mini game.

Septembre 2013:


Release of the Fourth Chapter of Green Valley.


Release of the third mini game.

Novembre 2013 :


Release of the Fifth Chapter of Green Valley.


Release of the fourth mini game.

Decembre 2013 :


Release of the full package of the ‘Green valley’.

The rest will be completely dependant on the result of the crowdfunding.
 

About TribeQuest : 
Grom'k, our hero, after having snored his night out, wakes on a sunny morning, having overslept a little as always and will leave to hunt for food. 
But today is different: during the night a meteor crashed not far away from his hut and  triggered changes that will disrupt his eventless little life...
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
This white rabbit is not going to help Grom'k, at all.
He’s going to do whatever it takes to prevent him from having a great day.
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
Bel’ana, the mysterious beauty who Grom'k will meet and who will radically change his life.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
About Red Killer :
Red Killer is the first puzzle game from the TribeQuest Universe.
In this game, you’ll find a series of level where you will have to get rid of all those mean creatures living in red cubes. But be careful, you must not lose the cute little monsters in the green cubes.
This is the first version of the game, we intend to keep on working on it a lot and make it much better. We first wanted to develop as much gameplay as we could without creating dozens of level each times.
We whish to make this game bigger with the help of the players, according to their preferences.
Enjoy this version of the game and tell us what you think.

Re-Bonjour

 Imaginez une toute petite planète dans un coin pénard d’une galaxie lointaine... Sur cette planète luxuriante, mais un tantinet dangereuse, vivent des petits êtres primitifs et roudouillards. 
Notre Héros s’appelle Grom'k, un guerrier solitaire, qui habite une petite hutte au bord d’un lac. Il se contente de plaisirs simples. Ses journées sont bien réglées, chercher à manger, ... manger, dormir... Mais un jour, quelque chose va venir bouleverser sa petite vie tranquille et l’obliger à partir à l’aventure vers des dangers importants. Il va même rencontrer l’amour... 
C’est cette histoire que nous allons vous raconter. Mais on ne va pas se contenter de la manière conventionnelle.
Nous allons créer un univers dans lequel nous développerons plusieurs jeux et médias.
 
Nous avons déjà terminé deux éléments :
Le premier chapitre du Jeu de plateforme ‘TribeQuest: The Green Valley’ qui raconte les aventures de Grom'k.
 
La première version du premier ‘mini jeu’ : ‘TribeQuest : Red Killer’ qui est un jeu de puzzle comportant pour le moment une quarantaine de niveaux.
 
Nous travaillons avec des directeurs artistiques expérimentés. Ils sont également en charge des cursus d’infographie et animation 3D de l’école ESIA 3D à Lyon. Nous travaillons avec certains de leurs étudiants. 
Notre volonté est d’avoir, dans nos jeux, la plus grande qualité graphique possible.
La première phase du projet est terminée. Nous venons de lancer une première version de ‘Green Valley’ et ‘Red Killer’ sur PC et MAC. Nous avons lancé notre propre plateforme de vente en ligne avec notre propre technologie de distribution.
Nous lançons maintenant la deuxième phase. Nous allons corriger et améliorer le premier chapitre de ‘Green Valley’. Nous allons aussi finir une première version du deuxième chapitre et attaquer la production du troisième. Nous allons améliorer et ajouter du contenu dans ‘Red Killer’ et nous allons aussi finir une première version d’un autre ‘mini jeu’.
Dans notre esprit, TribeQuest est un projet gigantesque. Vous pourrez jouer avec Grom'k mais aussi plein d’autres personnages. Vous aurez pleins de gameplays différents et vous suivrez Grom'k dans des aventures incroyables qui vont l'emmener très, très loin de son point de départ, à travers des dizaines de niveaux très variés. Vous aurez aussi pleins de jeux secondaires qui vont étendre l'univers de Tribe Quest dans pleins de directions.... 
Mais pour le moment, on commence petit à petit et on espère que le début vous plaira suffisamment pour vous donner envie de nous suivre pas à pas.
  
 IOZO GAMES :

 IOZO a été créée en 2004, principalement pour gérer du développement de technologies liées aux Jeux Vidéos.

En 2009, IOZO a entamé une transformation de son activité pour se concentrer essentiellement sur la création et la réalisation de Jeux Videos. Pour se doter des moyens nécessaires à la commercialisation de ses productions, le gérant de IOZO a créé une société de distribution en ligne, Play'n Buzz.


En 2010, IOZO s'est associée avec Philippe Louvet pour lancer la production du projet 'TribeQuest'.


Sous la direction artistique de Gilles Benois, ancien directeur artistique d'Eden Studios, actuel directeur pédagogique de l'école ESIA 3D, le projet TribeQuest a pu s’organiser correctement.


En 2011, la réalisation de Tribe Quest a démarré, ainsi que le développement de technologies liées à la distribution digitale pour la plateforme Play'n Buzz.

Principaux Jeux auxquels IOZO a pu participer :


Titres IOZO Games : 'TribeQuest - The Green Valley', 'TribeQuest - Red Killer', 'StartoonZ: Elisez 2012'.
 

Dominique Pavlin : Dominique a démarré sa carrière professionnelle en 1988 dans l'ingénierie logicielle puis a créé la société NetQuartz, plateforme technologique de distribution de logiciels, jeux vidéos et contenus multimédia. Il la quittera en 2004, époque à laquelle il va créer IOZO.
 Philippe Louvet: 
Philippe a démarré sa carrière dans les jeux videos en 1992, comme testeur externe de jeux pour la société Infogrames. Il a intégré cette société à plein temps en 1996 et occupé différentes responsabilités au sein du département d'édition. Après plusieurs années passées comme producteur, il a quitté la société (devenue ATARI en 2002) pour développer une activité de production indépendante. Philippe a participé aux jeux suivant : http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,2606
 
On fait les jeux dont on a envie, mais on les fait pour vous. Donc on veut travailler avec vous pour faire les meilleurs jeux possible, ensemble.
Au plus vous nous aiderez au départ, au plus nous gagnerons en autonomie et indépendance. 
Nous voulons vous apporter des expériences de jeu intéressantes, profondes et stimulantes. Mais pour cela, on a besoin d’y passer un peu plus de temps que pour des jeux plus simples. On pourrait aller proposer nos jeux à des éditeurs, pour avoir les moyens de nos ambitions, mais nous perdriions alors notre indépendance et nous ne pourrions plus vous écouter.
 Pour ceux qui veulent bien se lancer dans l’aventure avec nous, nous allons vous inclure petit à petit dans le projet. On va vous donner accès à un forum où nous pourrons discuter tous ensemble, où on va vous présenter nos idées, où on vous fera tester des bout de nos jeux au fur et à mesure de leur réalisation. On va vous poser des questions, on va vous écouter...

 Il nous semble tout d’abord important de vous proposer de financer des phases qui aboutissent à la création de quelque chose de concret. Mais pendant ces phases, toutes les parties du projet vont avancer aussi et vous participerez donc, de fait, à l’ensemble.
 1 / Premier objectif : 0€
Oui, vous avez pu le constater, nous lançons cette campagne de financement en mode flexible, ce qui veut dire que nous ne fixons pas un objectif minimum pour démarrer le projet. 
Comme nous l’avons déjà dit, le projet est déjà en bonne voie, nous avons dépensé beaucoup de notre argent personnel pour arriver où nous en sommes et nous avons les moyens de continuer comme ca. Mais tout faire nous même prend beaucoup de temps et maintenant que nous avons lancé une première version de nos jeux, nous aimerions aller un peu plus vite.
Pour ce budget, nous assurons :

Une version améliorée du 1er chapitre de ‘Green Valley’.
 

Une première version du 2ème chapitre de ‘Green Valley’.
 
 

Une version améliorée de ‘Red Killer’.

La sortie du chapitre 3 de ‘Green Valley’.


La sortie d'un nouveau ‘mini jeu’.

 6 / Objectif spécial : 1 500 000€

Si jamais un miracle se produisait et que vous participiez à hauteur d’un tel montant... ca changerait carrément les choses... Avec un tel budget, on agrandit l’équipe et on met plus de gameplay et de contenus.
On fait le jeu directement pour consoles PS3 et Xbox360 (et wii si vous nous aidez à trouver une bonne idée pour la wiiU)
  
On a un endroit un peu spécial chez IOZO Gamesqu'on appelle notre ‘bac à sable’. C’est un endroit où l’on se partage des idées, des concepts, des dessins, des jeux mêmes, ou des bouts de jeux.
Si vous tentez l’aventure avec nous, on va vous inviter à jouer avec nous dans notre bac à sable. Bien plus qu’un forum, vous aurez accès à des outils pour donner votre avis, nous aider à prendre des décisions sur nos développements, noter nos idées et concepts et même nos prototypes.
Bien que nous protégions nos créations et nos idées, nous vous faisons confiance pour garder pour vous ce que vous voyez dans le ‘bac à sable’. Une fois dans cette zone, vous avez accès à tout son contenu, sans restriction, nous vous demandons juste de ne pas diffuser ce que vous y trouverez.

A propos de TribeQuest :
Grom'k, notre héros, apres avoir ronflé copieusement toute la nuit, va se réveiller un beau matin, trop tard, comme à son habitude et partir chasser pour manger. Mais cette journée ne va pas être comme les autres. En effet, dans la nuit une météorite est tombée non loin de sa cabane et va provoquer des changements qui vont bouleverser sa petite vie tranquille...
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
Ce lapin blanc ne va pas du tout aider Grom'k, il va tout faire pour l’empêcher de passer une bonne journée...
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
Bel’ana, la beauté mystérieuse que Grom’k va rencontrer et radicalement changer sa vie. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A propos de 'Red Killer' :
'Red Killer' est le premier jeu de puzzle tiré de l'univers de TribeQuest.
Il consiste en une série de niveaux dans lesquels vous allez devoir vous débarrasser de toutes les vilaines créatures se trouvant dans un cube rouge tout en faisant attention à ne pas perdre les mignons petits monstres dans les cubes verts.
Ceci est la première version du jeu, nous comptons continuer à travailler dessus et l’améliorer. Nous avons d'abord voulu développer le plus de 'gameplay' différents, sans créer des dizaines de niveaux à chaque fois.
Nous souhaitons faire grandir ce jeu avec les joueurs, en fonction de ce qui plait le plus.
Alors amusez-vous bien avec cette version du jeu et donnez nous votre avis.

<p></p>The game world of ""Fight your Music!"" is generated by the music you import into the game. You roam around the world, fight monsters, train your character, collect randomly generated loot, interact with different factions and heroes, watch how they rise and crumble - all based on the songs you import. The combat system works like a rhythm game. Circles that you need to click will spawn depending on the currently playing song's Beats Per Minute and overall loudness. If the playing song's BPM and loudness is high, the attack circles are more likely to spawn, but your speed stat decreases sensitivity, so if your character has high speed stat, enemy attack circles will spawn in lesser numbers. At later stages in the game, you'll also be able to join factions, do global quests and manipulate faction diplomacy - cause a global war or create global peace - all under your control.<br/><br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1081424/files/20141208140220-Features.png?1418076140"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b>- Unique fantasy world, procedurally generated by the music you import into the game.</b><br/>The whole world is generated procedurally, based on an imported songs' beats per minute, loudness, and length of your music.<br/><br/><b>- Over 30 unique monsters, including their rare and elite counterparts.</b><br/><br/><b></b><p><b>- Political interactions between procedurally generated countries based on your songs' artists.<br/></b>Empires and countries are generated based on the Artist and the Album name. For example, the Artists’ name is interpreted as kingdom by the game while the Album name is the region. The more songs from the same artist, the bigger the country is. The more albums from the same artist, the more regions there are.</p>
<br/><b>- A living world that interacts with itself as you play and progress throughout the game.</b><br/>The factions will make alliances and wars between each other. The world interacts with itself even when you're out on the field, battling monsters or purchasing items.<br/><br/><b>- Various different events and quests with multiple outcomes.</b><br/>The world will change depending on the choices that you make throughout the game. Your choices will affect the condition of Factions and their standing or relationship with each other or with your character in a good or a bad way<br/><br/><b>- Event editor: Create your own stories, events and interactions.</b><br/>The powerful event editor will allow you to create rich events and stories for the game, while also giving you the ability to mod the game to your own liking.<br/><br/><b></b><p><b>- Unique character customization and stats system.<br/></b>The character customization in the game allows you to create your own hero based on your own liking. The old-school stat system will allow you to invest the attribute points in whichever attribute you prefer, which will affect a wide variety of statistics on your character.</p>
<br/><b>- Action packed combat based on your song's beats per minute, loudness and length.</b><br/><br/><b>- An abundance of Achievements that yield various rewards.</b><br/><br/><b>- Crafting and unique Item Infusion System - Enhance your item stats with songs!</b><br/>You will be able to collect materials and crate your own items. There will be many different ways of collecting the materials such as breaking down the items you don't need, looting the materials from your fallen foes or by purchasing them directly from a trader or a store. Item infusion however is the most interesting part as you will be able to permanently enchant one of your items with an infusion crystal, giving it powerful stats and decent bonuses.<br/><br/><b>- Available in English, Croatian, Russian and Japanese language at launch.</b><br/><p></p>

The game world of ""Fight your Music!"" is generated by the music you import into the game. You roam around the world, fight monsters, train your character, collect randomly generated loot, interact with different factions and heroes, watch how they rise and crumble - all based on the songs you import. The combat system works like a rhythm game. Circles that you need to click will spawn depending on the currently playing song's Beats Per Minute and overall loudness. If the playing song's BPM and loudness is high, the attack circles are more likely to spawn, but your speed stat decreases sensitivity, so if your character has high speed stat, enemy attack circles will spawn in lesser numbers. At later stages in the game, you'll also be able to join factions, do global quests and manipulate faction diplomacy - cause a global war or create global peace - all under your control.
- Unique fantasy world, procedurally generated by the music you import into the game.The whole world is generated procedurally, based on an imported songs' beats per minute, loudness, and length of your music.- Over 30 unique monsters, including their rare and elite counterparts.- Political interactions between procedurally generated countries based on your songs' artists.Empires and countries are generated based on the Artist and the Album name. For example, the Artists’ name is interpreted as kingdom by the game while the Album name is the region. The more songs from the same artist, the bigger the country is. The more albums from the same artist, the more regions there are.
- A living world that interacts with itself as you play and progress throughout the game.The factions will make alliances and wars between each other. The world interacts with itself even when you're out on the field, battling monsters or purchasing items.- Various different events and quests with multiple outcomes.The world will change depending on the choices that you make throughout the game. Your choices will affect the condition of Factions and their standing or relationship with each other or with your character in a good or a bad way- Event editor: Create your own stories, events and interactions.The powerful event editor will allow you to create rich events and stories for the game, while also giving you the ability to mod the game to your own liking.- Unique character customization and stats system.The character customization in the game allows you to create your own hero based on your own liking. The old-school stat system will allow you to invest the attribute points in whichever attribute you prefer, which will affect a wide variety of statistics on your character.
- Action packed combat based on your song's beats per minute, loudness and length.- An abundance of Achievements that yield various rewards.- Crafting and unique Item Infusion System - Enhance your item stats with songs!You will be able to collect materials and crate your own items. There will be many different ways of collecting the materials such as breaking down the items you don't need, looting the materials from your fallen foes or by purchasing them directly from a trader or a store. Item infusion however is the most interesting part as you will be able to permanently enchant one of your items with an infusion crystal, giving it powerful stats and decent bonuses.- Available in English, Croatian, Russian and Japanese language at launch.

<p><em>Epic War, Hexagons, Turn-Based Strategy, Boardagame, Rpg, Miniatures, Dragons, Demons, Mystery, Heroes, Kaos and Legendary Adventures... If you like these words you can't miss Fantasy Kommander.</em></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Do you remember <em>SSI (Strategic Simulation Inc.)</em> and its great games?</p>
<p>If the answer is <strong>YES</strong>, <strong>you can't miss this game</strong> because everything in it reminds of the incredible gaming experience that <em>SSI</em> created in its titles.</p>
<p>Great turn-based strategy and RPG games such as<em> Panzer General, Fantasy General or Pool of Radiance</em> inspired and guided us in the development of our project. However, with “<strong>Fantasy Kommander: Eukarion Wars</strong>” we've tried to do better than our masters, adding depth to the gameplay, to the story and the setting for this genre.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with <em>SSI</em>, but <em>you're looking for a strategy game with an elaborated battle system, a deep storyline, and a huge setting</em>, <strong>you probably</strong> <strong>don't want to miss this game too.</strong></p>

<p>Eladen</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Game</strong></p>
<p>Basically, “<strong>Fantasy Kommander: Eukarion Wars</strong>” is a <em>turn-based strategy game with RPG elements</em>, but <em>it can also be defined as a “Fantasy Wargame” or an “Advanced Computer Boardgame”</em>.</p>
<p>The gameplay is based on a traditional hex map, with a wide variety of terrains and units available.Most of your interactions with the game will be through the mouse. You will select, move, fight, and analyze units on the Battlefield or in the HeadQuarters (HQ) using a simple point-and-click system.</p>
<p>“<strong>Fantasy Kommander: Eukarion Wars</strong>” is an operational-level game: units approximate squads, with most of them consisting of about a hundred soldiers, though some (e.g. heroes, dragons) represent single entities. Every unit is like a RPG character with its own characteristics and special abilities that you can increase as soon as they level up.</p>
<p><em>The Battle System is very detailed</em> and is based on several Combat Tables, which take into account, among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>the strength ratio between the Attacker and Defender</li>
<li>the state of health and morale of the units</li>
<li>the terrain and many other tactical factors</li>
</ul>
<p>An important factor during a battle, is the orientation of the units: attacking the enemy on the flank rather than the front can make the difference between victory and defeat.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, and many other that you will discover in the game, maneuver your army carefully, and keep in mind that in order to become a great <strong>Kommander</strong> you must be able to take the right decision at the right time.</p>
<p>The game features single player campaigns following a intricate plot (see “The Story”) as well as multiplayer battles with varying objectives and several game modes. In these multiplayer challenges, the player can decide to take part in quick battles using ready-to-fight armies, or battles preceded by a management phase where they have to strategically plan their army taking into account varying financial resources.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Main Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Turn-based strategy/RPG game</li>
<li>An <strong>elaborated and detailed Battle System</strong> that considers the strength ratio between the Attacker and Defender, the state of health and morale of the units, the terrain and many other tactical factors</li>
<li>A <strong>deep and involving Storyline</strong> set in a world inspired by the European Middle Age and enriched by the Fantasy narrative tradition</li>
<li>4 Single Player Campaigns with 25 Epic Battles, 3 Heroes, Powerful Enemy Generals, and multiple Side Quests</li>
<li>
<strong>Over 70 different Units</strong> to enroll, upgrade and unleash in Battle</li>
<li>Every Unit is like a <strong>Rpg charater with many stats and abilities</strong> that you can manage and upgrade</li>
<li>Incredible spells</li>
<li>Hordes of Enemies</li>
<li>
<strong>Multiplayer Battles with different gameplay modes</strong> and objectives.</li>
<li>Hours and Hours of pure Strategy and Rpg fun!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Fantasy Kommander Eukarion Wars' Heroes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.foofastudios.com/img/FKEW/FantasyKommander-Eukarion_Heroes.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Fantasy Kommander Eukarion Wars' Heroes""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The plot develops during the single player campaigns, on and off the battlefields. There are 4 campaigns available, three of them take place in the great <strong>Empire of Adamantia</strong>, invaded by the forces of <strong>Kaos</strong>, and one in mysterious and unknown lands.</p>
<p>Players play a <strong>Kommander</strong> at the beginning of their military career, thrown into a titanic battle that is devastating the entire <strong>continent of Eukarion</strong>. Successive events, dialogues, and plot twists are carried on through the messages that <strong>Emperor Karl</strong> and the <strong>Great Council of Mages</strong> send to the young general who will have to find out, fighting hard battles, the final objective of the <strong>Abyss</strong>.</p>
<p>Players won't be alone in facing this incredible war adventure. Three great <strong>Heroes of Humans, Elves, and Dwarves</strong>, will follow and assist them in their trials, challenges, victories and defeats.</p>
<p>The game has been <strong>FULLY voiced</strong> in English and it's been conceived to give <strong>emphasis to the characters</strong>, friends and foes, that players will face on their adventure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Setting</strong></p>
<p>We put a lot of care in the development of the setting, creating a huge fantasy version of Medieval Europe. Empires, kingdoms, history and everything else on the map that you can see down here are the result of studies and researches aiming at a coherent fusion between reality and fantasy, following the great tradition of European epic and fantasy literature.</p>
<p>“<strong>Fantasy Kommander: Eukarion Tales</strong>” shows how Medieval Europe could have been if Orcs, Magic, Dragons, and demons of the deep abyss were real.</p>

16th October 2013: FANTASY KOMMANDER-EUKARION WARS RELEASED!
Please Check the Campaign Update to Redeem Your Copy.

Fantasy Kommander Eukarion Wars
Epic War, Hexagons, Turn-Based Strategy, Boardagame, Rpg, Miniatures, Dragons, Demons, Mystery, Heroes, Kaos and Legendary Adventures... If you like these words you can't miss Fantasy Kommander.
Introduction
Do you remember SSI (Strategic Simulation Inc.) and its great games?
If the answer is YES, you can't miss this game because everything in it reminds of the incredible gaming experience that SSI created in its titles.
Great turn-based strategy and RPG games such as Panzer General, Fantasy General or Pool of Radiance inspired and guided us in the development of our project. However, with “Fantasy Kommander: Eukarion Wars” we've tried to do better than our masters, adding depth to the gameplay, to the story and the setting for this genre.
If you're not familiar with SSI, but you're looking for a strategy game with an elaborated battle system, a deep storyline, and a huge setting, you probably don't want to miss this game too.

The Game
Basically, “Fantasy Kommander: Eukarion Wars” is a turn-based strategy game with RPG elements, but it can also be defined as a “Fantasy Wargame” or an “Advanced Computer Boardgame”.
The gameplay is based on a traditional hex map, with a wide variety of terrains and units available.Most of your interactions with the game will be through the mouse. You will select, move, fight, and analyze units on the Battlefield or in the HeadQuarters (HQ) using a simple point-and-click system.
“Fantasy Kommander: Eukarion Wars” is an operational-level game: units approximate squads, with most of them consisting of about a hundred soldiers, though some (e.g. heroes, dragons) represent single entities. Every unit is like a RPG character with its own characteristics and special abilities that you can increase as soon as they level up.
The Battle System is very detailed and is based on several Combat Tables, which take into account, among others:

the strength ratio between the Attacker and Defender
the state of health and morale of the units
the terrain and many other tactical factors

An important factor during a battle, is the orientation of the units: attacking the enemy on the flank rather than the front can make the difference between victory and defeat.
For all these reasons, and many other that you will discover in the game, maneuver your army carefully, and keep in mind that in order to become a great Kommander you must be able to take the right decision at the right time.
The game features single player campaigns following a intricate plot (see “The Story”) as well as multiplayer battles with varying objectives and several game modes. In these multiplayer challenges, the player can decide to take part in quick battles using ready-to-fight armies, or battles preceded by a management phase where they have to strategically plan their army taking into account varying financial resources.

The Story

 
 
 
The plot develops during the single player campaigns, on and off the battlefields. There are 4 campaigns available, three of them take place in the great Empire of Adamantia, invaded by the forces of Kaos, and one in mysterious and unknown lands.
Players play a Kommander at the beginning of their military career, thrown into a titanic battle that is devastating the entire continent of Eukarion. Successive events, dialogues, and plot twists are carried on through the messages that Emperor Karl and the Great Council of Mages send to the young general who will have to find out, fighting hard battles, the final objective of the Abyss.
Players won't be alone in facing this incredible war adventure. Three great Heroes of Humans, Elves, and Dwarves, will follow and assist them in their trials, challenges, victories and defeats.
The game has been FULLY voiced in English and it's been conceived to give emphasis to the characters, friends and foes, that players will face on their adventure.
 
The Setting
We put a lot of care in the development of the setting, creating a huge fantasy version of Medieval Europe. Empires, kingdoms, history and everything else on the map that you can see down here are the result of studies and researches aiming at a coherent fusion between reality and fantasy, following the great tradition of European epic and fantasy literature.
“Fantasy Kommander: Eukarion Tales” shows how Medieval Europe could have been if Orcs, Magic, Dragons, and demons of the deep abyss were real.
If you want to know more about the way the lead designer of FK:EW designed the history of the Eukarion Continent, have a look at this entry in our Dev Diary.
 
 
The Multiplayer System

Players can engage in several types of 1-to-1 online challenges:

Scenario

Relive heroic battles that made the History of the Eukarion continent! Each player has a fixed role in the battle: the units can be already placed and some very specific tasks have to be completed.

Short campaign

Challenge your adversary in a sequence of consecutive maps.

Skirmish

Select the map and place the units the way you want. Each map has a fixed group of units for each faction.

Headquarters

Both players start in the Headquarters, with a fixed amount of money. They can then manage these resources to build and upgrade their own army to bring to battle.

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Changing Eternity is typical jRPG with a special transformative twist. A long time ago, a witch ascended and started creating chaos. Everything that she covered with mist has begun to diminish and become corrupted. She made an alliance with the town of Borguc turning it's inhabitants into monsters. This has started a great war called The Eternity War.<br/><br/>The action of the game follows Tavien, a young prince who wants somewhere in the future rule over his father's kingdom. Since old times his home town Frexil is constantly taking on the monstrous adversaries of Borguc. Tavien decided to start his own quest - to find source of all of these happenings.<br/><br/>Together with his father's faithful guardian Vitel he goes onto an adventure into unknown. He wants to get to the bottom of this transfomative mystery. As it doesn't seem right he wants to know why people of Borguc forged such devilish alliance.<br/><br/>Inevitably, he meets the master villain of all evil - witch Hohepa. He tries to fight her off but being inexperienced he fails and get an unpleasant surprise. The evil one uses the moment of his weakness to turn him into a girl! Feasting on Tavien's powerlessness she grows even more powerful and gets back to her monstrous fortress.<br/><br/>Will Tavien be able to restore his original form? Is it possible to unveil the mystery of people of Borguc? And will people around him turn out to be his enemies or foes? This and more you will find in Changing Eternity.</p>

<p>Vitel is an experienced veteran of the battlefield who has many victories to his name. Though he may have ended the lives of many an enemy, he is soft hearted at his core. He is a master of many weapons, but he feels best with the lance.<br/><br/> At the moment he is the personal body guard of the prince Tavien, and is doing his best to make his wish about meeting other people come true. Devoted to his kingdom, he will protect the prince at any cost.</p>

<h2>What is Flimsee?</h2>
<p>Flimsee is the ultimate lawn game for fun and friendly competition.  It consists of three simple elements:  a cup, a stick, and a frisbee.</p>
<p>Inventor John Mally first conceived the idea back in 2008 during a frisbee match, when he saw a disc knock a cup off a snow pole.  Six years and several prototypes later, the original Flimsee kit has become a cult favorite among a loyal community of lawn gamers, tailgaters, and disc enthusiasts nationwide.</p>

<h2>Why we’re crowdfunding</h2>
<p>We’re making a more compact, safe to use, and retail friendly version of the game players know and love.  To accomplish this, we’ve partnered with Trident Design, an innovation incubator in Columbus, Ohio.  Together, we’ve come up with improvements that add up to a better Flimsee game at a better size, strength, and price.</p>
<p>Your contributions today will help us with the production and promotion of this new game set.  But more than that, you will be joining a community of loyal players who want to make this game everything it is meant to be, and help bring it to the world of future Flimsee fans waiting out there!</p>
<p>We believe in this game’s potential.  If you do too, please consider contributing.</p>
<p><strong>The new coupler:</strong></p>
<p>Breaking down the sticks with a one-piece, tight-fitting, easy-to-assemble solution has been the goal of Flimsee for a long time. We've tried multiple solutions, but this is the one. This polypropylene injection-molded coupler, made with our specific dimensions, solves all our retail and transportation challenges while also withstanding hard disc strikes.</p>

<h2>The history of Flimsee</h2>
<p>Seemingly ordinary events have led to some of history’s greatest discoveries and inventions. Consider the time line: Sir Isaac Newton observing the velocity of a simple falling apple in 1687 formulated the Universal Law of Gravitation.  The tossing of a used pie tin led to Walter Morrison producing the Pluto Platter in 1948. Then in 2008, John Mally saw a gliding Frisbee strike a snow pole with a cup resting on top. When this happened, both the cup and an idea that would forever change lawn games flew into action. Some call it luck. Others call it fate. We call it Flimsee.</p>
<p>For John, it’s an activity that began with a group of friends looking to add some friendly competition to their weekend. Once that 175gram Ultrastar missed its intended target (hands) and struck the pole, Mally and his friends discovered the remedy for their boredom. They gathered sticks, cups, and discs. They arranged them, formed teams, made rules, and fashioned a makeshift version of what has evolved into an ultimate disc-throwing showdown coined as Flimsee. The DIY game known on the Ultimate fields as ""cups"" and the college games known as 'frisbeer' is now bringing everyone together on a new playing field of well designed equipment.</p>
<p>From there forward,  Mally devoted every spare moment he had to finding better cups, safer sticks, and a challenging, but family friendly disc size. After ordering and testing dozens of cups, sticks, and discs, he finally assembled the first and finest Flimsee Set available. Then? Community and fun took over. A talented group of friends and family who shared the love and vision for Flimsee have developed Flimsee into an instant classic.</p>

""This is easily one of the most fun games I have played in a while. And it is hilarious to watch people try to catch the cups when the game is on the line. What a great game!""
Jonathon Horn, Amazon Customer Reviewer



What is Flimsee?
Flimsee is the ultimate lawn game for fun and friendly competition.  It consists of three simple elements:  a cup, a stick, and a frisbee.
Inventor John Mally first conceived the idea back in 2008 during a frisbee match, when he saw a disc knock a cup off a snow pole.  Six years and several prototypes later, the original Flimsee kit has become a cult favorite among a loyal community of lawn gamers, tailgaters, and disc enthusiasts nationwide.

How to play

Remaining true to the original meaning of Flimsee, there's no right way to play, only the funnest way for that day. The official rules to the Flimsee Cups game have been critically tested for maximum fun, speed, and fairness of play. Once you receive your Flimsee Set we look forward to staying in touch with you on your family's house rules. 


The Flimsee set

Flimsee is made from the highest quality  components and assembled in Ohio for reliable performance year after year.
Each Flimsee set includes:



A. 1 drawstring bag

Easily carry your Flimsee cups and discs when you're on the go or store it in the off season. The drawnstrings make it perfect to throw the it over your shoulder or hang on a hook.

 

B. 6 cups

Official Flimsee Cups are fully tested for maximum performance. We searched the world over for a super durable, perfectly sized cup with optimal bounce characteristics. As handy on the picnic table as they are on the playing field, these cups can be used in multiple ways.



 



C. 2 discs

A pair of straight flying, throw and catch 10"" Flimsee Discs. Weighing 117 grams each and featuring a deep rim design, they're the perfect choice for disc throwing games of all kinds. Just aim, toss and watch them fly!

 

D. 8 breakdown sticks

Solid 5/16"" fiberglass sticks that will quickly poke in the ground and flex at absurd angles when struck with a disc. The all new ball top couplings atop every stick allows you to connect two sticks to create four goal posts. The coupler will also allow us to develop a whole new lineup of  accessories we have planned for new games.



Add-ons



Stands

We found a way to allow players to play on any surface using Flimsee stands. We've created a wooden stands made with 2x10s and 2x4s that are perfect for tailgating and anywhere you can't puncture the ground. A heavy stand is imperative for the sticks to react independently, but you still want it light enough to transport. Made well by AJJ Cornhole of Cincinnati and the Amish in Northwest Ohio. 

 

Custom Flimsee Sets

Become the art director for 100 custom Flimsee Sets! Work directly with some incredibly talented designers at Trident Design to get you brand customized on each discs, cup, and bag for your sets. We also have a line of new color fiberglass we are working with and really look forward to some custom orders from the local business community looking for team building.

The history of Flimsee
Seemingly ordinary events have led to some of history’s greatest discoveries and inventions. Consider the time line: Sir Isaac Newton observing the velocity of a simple falling apple in 1687 formulated the Universal Law of Gravitation.  The tossing of a used pie tin led to Walter Morrison producing the Pluto Platter in 1948. Then in 2008, John Mally saw a gliding Frisbee strike a snow pole with a cup resting on top. When this happened, both the cup and an idea that would forever change lawn games flew into action. Some call it luck. Others call it fate. We call it Flimsee.
For John, it’s an activity that began with a group of friends looking to add some friendly competition to their weekend. Once that 175gram Ultrastar missed its intended target (hands) and struck the pole, Mally and his friends discovered the remedy for their boredom. They gathered sticks, cups, and discs. They arranged them, formed teams, made rules, and fashioned a makeshift version of what has evolved into an ultimate disc-throwing showdown coined as Flimsee. The DIY game known on the Ultimate fields as ""cups"" and the college games known as 'frisbeer' is now bringing everyone together on a new playing field of well designed equipment.
From there forward,  Mally devoted every spare moment he had to finding better cups, safer sticks, and a challenging, but family friendly disc size. After ordering and testing dozens of cups, sticks, and discs, he finally assembled the first and finest Flimsee Set available. Then? Community and fun took over. A talented group of friends and family who shared the love and vision for Flimsee have developed Flimsee into an instant classic.

We hit <b>over 45 000 votes</b>, people telling us they would buy the game once released.

</div><p><br/></p><p>INFRA includes <b>over 26 highly detailed levels</b> with <i>multiple routes</i> and <i>hidden secrets</i>. These sum up to <strong>over 11 hours of gameplay. </strong>You play as an engineer equipped with just a flashlight and a camera. You get to visit <i>dozens of unique locations</i>, such as water tunnels, sewers, maintenance tunnels, metro stations, abandoned factories or other facilities, the streets of the city, modern offices, old and wooden parts of the town, dams, rural areas, homes and more. You travel by foot, car, metro and other vehicles. It is your task to avoid hazards and survive in the crumbling world.</p><p>Puzzles are an important part of INFRA. Each location has its distinctive gameplay. As the player, you are faced with demanding challenges and situations in a fragile and complex world. You get to solve a variety of mechanical and electrical puzzles, each integrated to the world with lifelike functions. Some puzzles affect the life in the city, depending on you choices. Thereby, <b>your actions have consequences</b> beyond just getting past each level. Things can go wrong… terribly wrong.<br/></p><p>We have developed the game having your playing experience in mind. In other words, <strong>atmosphere is an important attribute of INFRA</strong>. We have spent a lot of time to make sure that the graphics, sound, immersion, and music make the world feel genuine and realistic. Part of the experience is distress as the player has to quickly try to solve a problem in the face of demise. However, INFRA is by no means a horror game. The question is – can you save the city from total disaster?</p>
<div><br/></div><div style=""width: 603px; height: 340px; overflow: hidden; display: block;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""340"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Ftw0RlpP.mp4&amp;src_secure=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Ftw0RlpP.gifv&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Ftw0RlpPh.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=video%2Fmp4&amp;schema=imgur"" style=""border: 0;"" width=""620""></iframe></div></div><br/><p></p><p>Third important dimension of the game is the story. That is, INFRA tells about deep structural corruption in a realistic but fictional city called Stalburg. The physical structure reflects and symbolizes past interests and political games. As an engineer, your days go from interesting yet ordinary facility inspection to struggles against the mistakes and hazards of the past. You get to use your wits and experience to <b>balance between survival and the quest for truth</b>. There’s a lot to discover and learn about the world also outside the beaten path.</p><p>Let us introduce Stalburg in a few more words. Stalburg is large Baltic/European metropolis, which was founded during the medieval times as a mining town. It used to be one of the most important European steel producers, a major industrial power. The city is <strong>rich in history</strong>, with medieval castles and other historical locations visitable in game.</p><p>It is also <strong>realistic</strong> – everything in the city has a function and the city is planned to function like a real city. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Multiple different districts with personalities and backgrounds of their own. From the 1900s industrial areas to modern business parks and wooden old towns. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Now decaying infrastructure was built during the 1960s when the city's industrialization was at its peak.</span>
The city is <strong>aesthetic</strong> – there is lot of art glorifying city's industrious past. The city embeds <i>interesting political history</i>, defined by its industrial past. Major political axles are anti-technological vs. technological and liberal vs. authoritative. The city is at a point of redefining itself. These multiple political parties and organizations add to the story, a<b> deep networked story</b> in which corruption has far-reaching roots.</p>
The final note on features. We are modders, which means that this aspect is important to as well. Thereby, the game provides <strong>great opportunities for modification!</strong><div><br/></div><div>

<p>Our development team consists of active players and respected members of the modding community. We have participated in numerous and demanding projects ever since 2006. </p>
<p>As a team and company we believe in values of <strong>profundity, aestheticity, fairness, </strong>and <strong>democracy</strong>. The first two values define our approach to game development, while the latter two define our approach to the player community.</p>
<p>Meet <strong>Oskari Samiola </strong>– the founder of Loiste:</p>
<p>""He is a true force of nature, with sharp vision, a sense of mission and an urge to make things happen."" —prof. Iiro Jussila, chairman of the board</p>
<p>I grew up playing strategy and simulation games. I always wanted to make something of my own, even on my first own computer and the first game I played on it. The first thing I did in the game was to go to the level editor and create a unique level and played that instead of the premade levels. Eventually this desire turned into an active modding hobby. </p>
<p>Even today I like in games is the possibility to create something your own or to embed yourself in a deep complex world with nearly unlimited places and stories to discover. INFRA goes more into the latter category... I'm also inspired by things and spaces that others might not appreciate. In every creative/simulation game I always seek the most extreme, mountainous or otherwise nearly ""impossible"" terrain to build, for me ""flat"" is a curse word. </p>
<p>As people around me very well know, my wildest dream is to settle Antarctica (and then space) and to turn it into prosperous forward thinking society. But I guess the closest to that what I could achieve is to turn that vision into a game. This is in fact how the idea of INFRA was born. I came up with it after watching ""Crumbling America"" documentary. I realized I was asking myself ""could this be turned into a game?"" Soon after that I pitched the idea for my friends in the modding community and we set up small team to make it reality. </p>
<p>So here I am – and we are – looking for support from like-minded people or anyone who considers INFRA – puzzles or story – intriguing and important.  <br/><br/>Meet the rest of the team!<br/><b><br/></b><b>Jukka Koskelainen </b>is a creative level-architect with an eye for details. He is a perfectionist -  there is nothing that can slip through on his watch.<br/><b><br/>Mikko Viitaja  </b>is the master of level design. He is extremely creative and gives impressive finishing touches. Like a silent assassin he eliminates problems in no time.<br/><br/><b>Aleksi Juvani </b>is our cunning self-taught programmer. He is a true engineer soul, who is thinking all the time.<br/><b><br/>Riku Vauhkonen </b>makes characters and other 3D models for the game. He sits in his own corner at the office. Nobody knows how he works, but things get done on a high level.</p>

<p>We
have two main purposes for the campaign, which can also help you
understand why we chose the flexible funding option. First, <b>we
want to eliminate risks of both parties – you and us</b>. 
</p>
<p>As
it comes to our risks, the purpose of the campaign relates to company finances and
team’s ability to work. We have been developing the game for a number of years without any pay. In the beginning of 2015 we were able to raise
money just about enough to bring the game to the market. However, without extra funding we cannot pay the team enough salary to keep them working on the game full-time. This means delaying the release, since we do not want to cut any features. We also need finances to keep the company running until the game starts producing revenue, which happens only a few months after the launch. A risk buffer is required in order to work without overwhelming distress about personal or company finances. In addition, there are many important targets to use the accumulating funds such as community building and the increase of visibility so that people know about INFRA. This all calls for additional investments in personnel and outside services.  </p>
<p>As
it comes to your risks, we feel it would not be fair if you did not
get what we promise in return to your contribution to our campaign.
Fixed funding would mean that you would just get your money
back without the game or any other perk. Your time and effort would be wasted if the campaign failed. As we
chose flexible funding, <strong>you can be sure that you get the unique perk
you choose. </strong>You can also be sure that <strong>every dollar you contribute
counts </strong>and helps us finalize and launch the game in the way we want
to and you deserve. 
</p>
<p>Second,
and just as important, purpose of the campaign is community. We
want to<b> build, empower and serve the INFRA community</b>. The closer
you follow us and the more you engage in discussions with us, the
better you know us and the more you can trust that this game will be
something special and with particular depth to it. We on the other
hand wish to enrich our understanding of your needs and aspirations.
This campaign offers us the possibility to get your feedback and use
that in the development of the game and its various dimensions. The
campaign also provides you a great opportunity to participate and
have fun with us.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434393496/cvwtc77fzj3aszu9pusf.png"" src="""" style=""width: 619.73px; height: 16px;""/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In this campaign we aim at $70 000. We wanted to set the goal close to the sum
 we believe will most ideally serve the campaign purpose described above. In our 
calculations we included the following costs (percentages are 
indicative, but not exact). Software and outsourcing (40%), 
pre-launch marketing and post-release support (40%), modest salaries for
 the team and fair pay for outside help and special talent (10%), and rents and 
taxes (10%). We would love to share exact figures, but we also want to and need to protect the interests of our partners in this campaign. </p>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><p>What happens if the campaign target is not reached? As put forward above, the game development team will have to work part time and delay the launch of the game by a few months from the planned October 2015. The team will also have to let go of the office and cut pay for all parties involved. There will also be no money for marketing around the launch.</p>
<p>To sum up, <b>the game will come out no matter what</b>. And it will be as great as envisioned. The difference that your contribution makes is that the game will be out much sooner and with much more interesting things taking place around the launch. Most importantly, you will give us the opportunity to work on finalizing the game and preparing the launch without too much financial distress.</p>
<p>Each contribution takes us closer to the target. Intermediate goals could be defined roughly as follows. By reaching $30 000 the game should be out in the planned schedule. By $50 000 we should be able to maintain a psychologically important risk buffer. By $70 000 we should be able to gain visibility around the launch and to provide support to the players during the first months after the release.</p></span><p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435430261/be6slp0xprgwcpkhq3oy.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p>
<p>We've already received a lot of feedback and gained some media attention in Finland, France, Japan and Taiwan during the campaign. As a result of the feedback, we are looking at the possibility to have the game out in multiple languages. If the campaign target is reached, the extra contribution will go towards <b>translating the game to languages for which there is most demand!</b></p>
<p>If the campaign goes well, we will turn our post-launch attention to developing <strong>a multi-player version of INFRA</strong> with challenging puzzles that require a number of players' joint effort to solve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434364884/ni4knymxib20bsy0cqoq.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/>This campaign provides you an opportunity to <strong>pre-order the game </strong>and to get some other <strong>unique INFRA swag</strong>, such as our soundtrack or a special brand t-shirt! Importantly, it also provides you <i>an opportunity to be part of the game world</i>. For example, you can leave your own mark on the game itself! You can claim an everlasting position as one of those people, the community, who made INFRA happen!</p>
<p>We want to be fair and build a good relationship with all backers. That's why all of <i>our perks are designed to provide value per se</i>. In addition, we don't ask for multiple hundreds of dollars or more for any of the perks – we feel we would be abusing the community's trust and goodwill by doing so. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, you can also trust that the game will come. Most of our chapters and maps are close to complete and the coming months will be spent on finalizing, testing and perfecting the work. We have a lot of future content planned for the one and only edition of the game, which <b>will continue to be updated</b> with new features after the release.<br/></p>

</div></div>","INFRA is a first-person puzzle adventure game. While the main focus of the game is on puzzle solving, it also has a strong emphasis on story, world and atmosphere, similar to games like The Talos Principle and Portal 2.We first started working on INFRA way back in 2011 and got the game greenlit on Steam two years later. We hit over 45 000 votes, people telling us they would buy the game once released. We peaked top 4, and following the overwhelming support from the community (thank you!), we decided to establish our company Loiste Interactive to develop games – starting with INFRA.



INFRA includes over 26 highly detailed levels with multiple routes and hidden secrets. These sum up to over 11 hours of gameplay. You play as an engineer equipped with just a flashlight and a camera. You get to visit dozens of unique locations, such as water tunnels, sewers, maintenance tunnels, metro stations, abandoned factories or other facilities, the streets of the city, modern offices, old and wooden parts of the town, dams, rural areas, homes and more. You travel by foot, car, metro and other vehicles. It is your task to avoid hazards and survive in the crumbling world.Puzzles are an important part of INFRA. Each location has its distinctive gameplay. As the player, you are faced with demanding challenges and situations in a fragile and complex world. You get to solve a variety of mechanical and electrical puzzles, each integrated to the world with lifelike functions. Some puzzles affect the life in the city, depending on you choices. Thereby, your actions have consequences beyond just getting past each level. Things can go wrong… terribly wrong.We have developed the game having your playing experience in mind. In other words, atmosphere is an important attribute of INFRA. We have spent a lot of time to make sure that the graphics, sound, immersion, and music make the world feel genuine and realistic. Part of the experience is distress as the player has to quickly try to solve a problem in the face of demise. However, INFRA is by no means a horror game. The question is – can you save the city from total disaster?
Third important dimension of the game is the story. That is, INFRA tells about deep structural corruption in a realistic but fictional city called Stalburg. The physical structure reflects and symbolizes past interests and political games. As an engineer, your days go from interesting yet ordinary facility inspection to struggles against the mistakes and hazards of the past. You get to use your wits and experience to balance between survival and the quest for truth. There’s a lot to discover and learn about the world also outside the beaten path.Let us introduce Stalburg in a few more words. Stalburg is large Baltic/European metropolis, which was founded during the medieval times as a mining town. It used to be one of the most important European steel producers, a major industrial power. The city is rich in history, with medieval castles and other historical locations visitable in game.It is also realistic – everything in the city has a function and the city is planned to function like a real city. Multiple different districts with personalities and backgrounds of their own. From the 1900s industrial areas to modern business parks and wooden old towns. Now decaying infrastructure was built during the 1960s when the city's industrialization was at its peak.
The city is aesthetic – there is lot of art glorifying city's industrious past. The city embeds interesting political history, defined by its industrial past. Major political axles are anti-technological vs. technological and liberal vs. authoritative. The city is at a point of redefining itself. These multiple political parties and organizations add to the story, a deep networked story in which corruption has far-reaching roots.
The final note on features. We are modders, which means that this aspect is important to as well. Thereby, the game provides great opportunities for modification!





Our development team consists of active players and respected members of the modding community. We have participated in numerous and demanding projects ever since 2006. 
As a team and company we believe in values of profundity, aestheticity, fairness, and democracy. The first two values define our approach to game development, while the latter two define our approach to the player community.
Meet Oskari Samiola – the founder of Loiste:
""He is a true force of nature, with sharp vision, a sense of mission and an urge to make things happen."" —prof. Iiro Jussila, chairman of the board
I grew up playing strategy and simulation games. I always wanted to make something of my own, even on my first own computer and the first game I played on it. The first thing I did in the game was to go to the level editor and create a unique level and played that instead of the premade levels. Eventually this desire turned into an active modding hobby. 
Even today I like in games is the possibility to create something your own or to embed yourself in a deep complex world with nearly unlimited places and stories to discover. INFRA goes more into the latter category... I'm also inspired by things and spaces that others might not appreciate. In every creative/simulation game I always seek the most extreme, mountainous or otherwise nearly ""impossible"" terrain to build, for me ""flat"" is a curse word. 
As people around me very well know, my wildest dream is to settle Antarctica (and then space) and to turn it into prosperous forward thinking society. But I guess the closest to that what I could achieve is to turn that vision into a game. This is in fact how the idea of INFRA was born. I came up with it after watching ""Crumbling America"" documentary. I realized I was asking myself ""could this be turned into a game?"" Soon after that I pitched the idea for my friends in the modding community and we set up small team to make it reality.

taxes (10%). We would love to share exact figures, but we also want to and need to protect the interests of our partners in this campaign. 
What happens if the campaign target is not reached? As put forward above, the game development team will have to work part time and delay the launch of the game by a few months from the planned October 2015. The team will also have to let go of the office and cut pay for all parties involved. There will also be no money for marketing around the launch.
To sum up, the game will come out no matter what. And it will be as great as envisioned. The difference that your contribution makes is that the game will be out much sooner and with much more interesting things taking place around the launch. Most importantly, you will give us the opportunity to work on finalizing the game and preparing the launch without too much financial distress.
Each contribution takes us closer to the target. Intermediate goals could be defined roughly as follows. By reaching $30 000 the game should be out in the planned schedule. By $50 000 we should be able to maintain a psychologically important risk buffer. By $70 000 we should be able to gain visibility around the launch and to provide support to the players during the first months after the release. 

We've already received a lot of feedback and gained some media attention in Finland, France, Japan and Taiwan during the campaign. As a result of the feedback, we are looking at the possibility to have the game out in multiple languages. If the campaign target is reached, the extra contribution will go towards translating the game to languages for which there is most demand!
If the campaign goes well, we will turn our post-launch attention to developing a multi-player version of INFRA with challenging puzzles that require a number of players' joint effort to solve.
 
This campaign provides you an opportunity to pre-order the game and to get some other unique INFRA swag, such as our soundtrack or a special brand t-shirt! Importantly, it also provides you an opportunity to be part of the game world. For example, you can leave your own mark on the game itself! You can claim an everlasting position as one of those people, the community, who made INFRA happen!
We want to be fair and build a good relationship with all backers. That's why all of our perks are designed to provide value per se. In addition, we don't ask for multiple hundreds of dollars or more for any of the perks – we feel we would be abusing the community's trust and goodwill by doing so. 
As mentioned above, you can also trust that the game will come. Most of our chapters and maps are close to complete and the coming months will be spent on finalizing, testing and perfecting the work. We have a lot of future content planned for the one and only edition of the game, which will continue to be updated with new features after the release.

<p><em>The world of Utrelia, which is in a universe that is parallel to that of humans, has been the victim of a curse which began roughly five thousand years ago at the hands of those who once lived there.</em><br/><br/><em>According to manuscripts and remaining works, five thousand years ago the world was inhabited by intelligent beings similar to the human beings of our Universe. For unclear reasons, the entire population of Utrelia had gathered in one of the world’s regions and this meant that the different cultures of the populations, which were previously scattered in different areas of the world, were joined together. Overt time this created a single-culture population whose customs were influenced by the various cultures of the past.</em><br/><br/><em>The inhabitants of Utrelia were very close to esotericism: every day they carried out rituals for various reasons and all the children who reached 12 years of age, were initiated to the Art of Magic. Their innate curiosity led them to understand and experiment with the art of Dark Magic. They made fun of the forces of nature, relied on malevolent spirits for all the problems they encountered and often experimented new rituals. Their self-conceit had convinced them that they could control everything and nothing and no one could ever do anything against them.</em><br/><br/><em>The thirst for knowledge of the inhabitants of Utrelia was the cause of their own demise: the last manuscripts found, before complete silence broke out, reveal some obscure rituals, which were to be carried out by all the population for 5 days and 5 nights. These rituals would allow the entire population to know the ultimate reality of things in exchange for their spirits.</em><br/><br/><em>It is due to these rituals that the entire population of Utrelia disappeared suddenly roughly five thousand years ago: they were deceived by some demons who promised them the supreme knowledge and instead simply trapped, perhaps forever, their spirits in the Ancestral Pearls to store their energy and use it for their most infamous purposes.</em><br/><br/><em>The people of Utrelia can no longer live in their world, but you can give their spirits peace and free them from this curse.</em></p>

<p>Well, it all started about a year and a half ago. My mother worked as an aid in a severely handicapped class at an elementary school. I went and occasionally hung out in the classroom after my school was let out. So I gradually began to notice that almost all of the kids played on the computer. And I also began to notice that the games they played were too simple for them, leading them to quickly abandon them. So, I began designs on a game that would be simple enough for a mentally handicapped child to complete, but fun enough to keep them interested. After about a week, armed with a bug filled and more than slightly glitchy game, I showed them how to play. The results were phenomenal. All of the kids loved it and wanted to keep playing for as long as possible. I was ecstatic and began adding real sprites as opposed to placeholders, as well as patching bugs. After about a week of design, My computer crashed, leaving me with no backup and nothing but a concept. Even after I purchased a new computer, personal issues such as moving and cancer in the family caused me to spend little time on making a game. And so, after over a year had passed from the day I abandoned the project, I began again. I started a tumblr blog for the game <a href=""http://hungrystar.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://hungrystar.tumblr.com/</a> and started remaking it from the ground up. It was more advanced than my original build, but also filled with more bugs. And now, after hours of effort by me and the talented sprite designer Reypjen <a href=""http://reypjen.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://reypjen.tumblr.com/</a>, we finally feel confident enough to ask for your help. Because this game has grown from a simple project for mentally handicapped children into something that we feel all children should enjoy. And with your help we can do that! </p>
<p>Now, here is what we need to complete the game right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acoustica Mixcraft to create the soundtrack $75</li>
<li>Game Maker Master Studio $500</li>
<li>Game Maker Windows version $40</li>
<li>payment for Reypjen $15 (at least. This could go up if we get over our goal)</li>
<li>A license to distribute apps through apple $100</li>
<li>Magic $1000000000000000000000000 (not included. Some assembly required See your doctor to determine if magic is right for you.)</li>

Well, it all started about a year and a half ago. My mother worked as an aid in a severely handicapped class at an elementary school. I went and occasionally hung out in the classroom after my school was let out. So I gradually began to notice that almost all of the kids played on the computer. And I also began to notice that the games they played were too simple for them, leading them to quickly abandon them. So, I began designs on a game that would be simple enough for a mentally handicapped child to complete, but fun enough to keep them interested. After about a week, armed with a bug filled and more than slightly glitchy game, I showed them how to play. The results were phenomenal. All of the kids loved it and wanted to keep playing for as long as possible. I was ecstatic and began adding real sprites as opposed to placeholders, as well as patching bugs. After about a week of design, My computer crashed, leaving me with no backup and nothing but a concept. Even after I purchased a new computer, personal issues such as moving and cancer in the family caused me to spend little time on making a game. And so, after over a year had passed from the day I abandoned the project, I began again. I started a tumblr blog for the game http://hungrystar.tumblr.com/ and started remaking it from the ground up. It was more advanced than my original build, but also filled with more bugs. And now, after hours of effort by me and the talented sprite designer Reypjen http://reypjen.tumblr.com/, we finally feel confident enough to ask for your help. Because this game has grown from a simple project for mentally handicapped children into something that we feel all children should enjoy. And with your help we can do that! 
Now, here is what we need to complete the game right now:

Acoustica Mixcraft to create the soundtrack $75
Game Maker Master Studio $500
Game Maker Windows version $40
payment for Reypjen $15 (at least. This could go up if we get over our goal)
A license to distribute apps through apple $100
Magic $1000000000000000000000000 (not included. Some assembly required See your doctor to determine if magic is right for you.)

Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about
and to people they trust.
Introducing my background and myself.
 Hi I'm Marc Antony Stewart. Since
1989, I've been quietly working away, on my board game Sangreal. My background
is philosophy, psychology, theology, art, writing, and more than a passing interest in extrasensory perception (ESP), and the subconscious mind.

Briefly describing my campaign and why it's important to me.
 This campaign is important to me,  because the
passion in my life is only there when I am helping others. But I cannot
continue to do any more not-for-profit work without
your crowdfunding help here today. 
Expressing the magnitude of what contributors will help me achieve.
The
magnitude of what contributors will help me achieve cannot be underestimated
as the Sangreal board game is the mainspring tool for bringing universal
suffrage through crowdfunding as detailed on the homepage of http://QofS.Org.
What We Need & What You Get
Explaining how much funding I need and
where it's going. Being transparent and specific; as people need to trust us to
want to fund us.
The funding is required to cover the cost of printing a board game set with well over one thousand separate cards, marketing, building a great website around the Sangreal board game by partnering with Amazon to use their shopping cart with its excellent shipping options, a T.V commercial shot showing the first boxed set off the printing press being played targeting the university student market and those romantically inclined as couples, families, friends and co-workers. 
Telling people about my unique perks. Getting you excited!
The best perk we have is a Sangreal board game set which is delivered to your door hot off the presses thanks only to your kind,  generous contributions.  Please take a look at the many perks on offer.
Describing where the funds go if I don't reach my entire goal. 
If the funding target
     is not reached I will use the money to produce the wooden handcrafted game
     sets and use http://QofS.Org which already shows the game being
     played, using Paypal to process the sales. I will
     spend some of the money on marketing by direct mail and on radio talkback
     shows where me and the DJ will play Sangreal . . . reading out a game Great Thoughts quotation
     and making an original comment to get the listeners comments rolling in live on air!The Impact

Explaining more about my campaign and letting people
know the difference their contribution will make:
Explaining why my project is valuable to the contributor and to the
world. 
Sangreal game brings about conversations amongst its player's on a wide range of famous thought provoking interesting quotations and other subject matter cards as detailed further down on this Indiegogo funding page. Sangreal beats the drum of life, of politics, of religion, of science, of psychology, of philosophy, of struggle, triumph, mystery, serendipity and people's differences. It generates thoughts well beyond the weather and the usual everyday banter of ho hum mundane day-to-day thoughts. Sangreal play on mass in every living room and televised play with its one million dollar prize for the grand winning player and for each of the best winning family of player's and couple. Creating a wonderful quantum entanglement of people's individual consciousness, affecting the mass consciousness, by way of the flow, of the games conversations, into general everyday life exposure to moments giving player's and people they meet chances to communicate in more meaningful ways on topics we all want to be discussing in the world right now. Especially the women and children doing two-thirds of the global work for only one-tenth of the world's income and no universal suffrage to promote a ground-swell of freedom of speech creating a world full of global citizens in the know! 
Pointing out my successful track record with projects like this. 
I have
     successfully completed my Sangreal Coffee Table Book about the end of disease and violence now being in our grasp and the reason the board
     game Sangreal is needed in the world right now to assist this change . . . taking me since 1995 to write. Also other completed projects are a science-fiction
     movie for Hollywood titled “Thinker toys” and 15 books some rather short as eBooks and others 200 to 300 pages long as paperbacks available from Amazon presently and soon to be available in libraries and bookstores.  Sangreal as a project has taken me from one triumph to the next. Like the drawing up of the playing board design, making it into a wooden playing board, making it into a wooden box, making the small wooden playing
     goblets, same the large goblet in Apricot tree wood, same the small pawn playing pieces, same finding the tiny wooden voting
     spheres to allow the many trials we put the game through until the rules (further down this page) were just the way you'll like them!



Making it real for people and building trust.
Like you I am choosing how best to make a change in the world. The success of Sangreal board game and universal suffrage (global voting) is down to your contributions . . . in exchange for what I hope will be some very nice perks. 
The Sangreal project has been helped in this way many times already by people just like you who have a care about helping out the best they can. Such as the local pizza
     shop owner who gave me the simple yet profound recipes for the shops secret pizza base sauce and dough mixture. 
And also I was travelling
     through a small country town in Melbourne, Australia where I had eaten the most delightful carrot cake . . . this time round, asking the
     shopkeeper, about the cakes baker, told she lived next door, I found her sitting on her front steps. Telling her of my love for her carrot cake she gave me the recipe. I had mentioned it to someone, who against my integrity sold it to a major airline; now dished up as inflight dessert. 


Then
     there is great grandmother's Hiker’s Cake, which does not hang around for long, a family and friends favorite, lovely and soft, melting in your mouth and requiring no baking, made from plain supermarket brought biscuits, able to be made while camping. 
Nancy my cousin Gary’s wife is the baker of her family famous, to-die-for Chocolate Gateau Cake recipe. 
And there are my own recipes; such as a twist on the standard Oyster’s
     Kilpatrick Dish for men that burn everything and my Two Spices Buttery Steak Sauce recipe for for any kind steak to liven it up to cuisine standard for you budding chefs at home! And don't miss out on the special bonus recipes from my mother's baking and cooking scrapbook pages!
Risks & Challenges
Sharing what qualifies me to overcome any
hurdles. 
As my sister Susan said, “Marc
     no matter how things go you always turn them around”. I am lucky I
     naturally gravitate towards forward-thinking visualization being my own psychology of happiness, always striving to move forward with confidence and determined intentions of the best happening.  
Describing my plan for solving any challenges. 
To solve challenges that come my way I use meditation which gives me the gift of going along with the flow. For hard decisions I will use my Holy Grail Method as detailed in my Sangreal Coffee Table Book. Basically it is the method whereby one can ask any question of the subconscious and get an immediate reply into the blank space formed in the mind . . . the answer is always placing one on the immediate solution path to the problem to be solved . . . in always a strange and empowering way.  Also I have learned to concentrate
     on one project at a time until completion. It is in this way I get a sense of satisfaction, and I am quickly able to move on. 
Other Ways You Can Help.

Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't
mean you can't help!
Asking folks to get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.
I just cannot stress
     enough how valuable you are if you let others know to Google Sangreal on Indiegogo.  What I say to strangers I meet about Sangreal is: A player is asked to read out aloud a quotation and
     then asked to make their original comment on it and then the game is open to comments by all players, opening up tremendous conversations on topics of great interest. 
Reminding you to use the Indiegogo share
tools! 
You may have the gift of knowing your way around
     the social websites, I do not, and I admire anyone who has such a skill, as, Facebooking or Twitter tweeting! Instead I am on a learning curve. If
     you think to yourself I do not mind helping Marc and his daughter's out with their Sangreal campaign on Indiegogo. Please feel free to utilize all of the tools, like the share buttons you
can click on and then you can say I was genuinely one of those responsible for
turning the Sangreal board game project on Indiegogo VIRAL!!! In other
words feel free to share this Indiegogo project. I know as we all know
that word-of-mouth is the greatest and most sought after form of advertising in
the world . . . it's freedom of speech at its best!
We thank you for your contribution and you'll be able to say, ""I was a really
big cog in the wheel that made the Sangreal board game a reality"".
Sangreal Way Of Play Rules:  Players choose a small cup each and the 7 same color pawn playing pieces and select a starting position on one of the seven points of the playing board. Then some of the Great Thoughts, The Rest, The Quest, Science Notes and Kid's Corner cards are placed face down on the table. The player who throws the highest score with the two dice begins the game. Players remain on the outer pathway until they collect the full set of ""Hallows"" cards. Players may move in any direction on the outer pathway. When a player lands on a Hallows (H) square all players focus their attention on the moment for A Gathering has been called. The player who is on the Hallows square picks out a single card from off the top of any of the piles of cards except for The Quest category. The player on the Hallows (H) space reads this card out loudly to all the players present. The purpose of the game is to allow opportunities for all players to express themselves. Speaking in any way they would like to express themselves. Regardless of age (Kids Corner and Science Notes cards), life experience, or standing in eyes of anyone other than their own eyes the player on the Hallows (H) square must speak out aloud their comment first before the other players get their chance to make a comment of their own. As simple as A.B.C. And this is all there is to this game and more-so what follows is the magic the game creates. 
During play any player who laughs in an obvious mocking or who gets angry at another player's comments for any reason during the entire game play. Must leave the table completely and try to remain as silent as possible, for any length of time as decided prior to play commencing. Or using an ordinary 3-minute kitchen egg timer. Of course once the time out is over. The player concerned takes up a turn when the die comes around to them again. Of course this rule can be ignored if you as players decide you want more of a university debate where the conversations can be more of a free for all more promoting a more complete freedom of speech.It makes conversations happen in a very good way on a wide variety of subjects. Instantly it gets people talking. It is like a truth serum. Being really cupids arrows and bow to play romance or friendship between older players and the young for fun. Either a discussion of note ensues or the voting commences as follows. Time for the ""Reckoning"" to begin players! If you decide on as little as a whim our player on the (H) Hallowed Ground is far from Dim then drop a sphere into the Sangreal Cup. However if you decide our player’s notion is shallow Small-Talk or back-pedalling Tall-talk. There’s no need to pout or shout. Simply, do not place your sphere in the cup!  Sangreal does not need any rhetoric to hurt its players. Forcing turtles back into shells. So relax Jack and Jill and allow King Arthur, Queen Guinevere and Company an opportunity to show their way, their Round Table Way. And those who sit around it honor the art of Chivalry, courage and courtesy. If you are standing on ""Hallowed Ground"" and the Sangreal (Holy Grail) Cup sounds out its Reckoning Tone by the majority vote you may select a Hallows card. If on the H and you do not hear Merlin's tone drop in like a cherry pip stone on its own. Be still with your throat. You can only collect a ""Hallows"" card when the majority of players place a sphere in the Sangreal cup or when the cup runneth over through jubilation of discussion. Being simply the Hallows card given as this player’s comment has set the game, every brain alight . . . on fire, being the hearts desire. 
Once a player has collected the four Hallows cards he or she throws the die on their next turn. Beginning their journey to claim the seven Virtues. It’s the timeless fascination of the Virtues you must now unravel as you travel the inner pathways. The seven Pillar of Virtue (V) spaces are joined by a maze of pathways. Each player seeking to express their true self’s ability as best they can. Proceeds to the Pillar of Virtue of their choosing and so on to each in the order they deem best. Exact number does not need to be thrown to achieve position on a Pillar of Virtue. These positions are marked with a V. Once a player arrives on a pillar of Virtue (V) space they may choose to pick a Quest card off the top of the pile and answer its question with a yes or a no. A player other than the player attempting to answer the Quest card question reads the card out aloud and gives the answer on the card's back. When the card is no longer required it is returned to the bottom of the cards for selection. When a player successfully answers a Quest card question. They collect the Virtue card of their choosing and leave their color pawn like marker playing piece on this Pillar of Virtue (V) before you go, to let you know you have been to this destination on your travels. As the playing boards magic ride drives you deeper into its magic inner spaces. Later letting you know you have been to this V space and are on Track to empower yourself with the entire seven Virtue cards. If unsuccessful at answering a Quest question. Try again to get your Virtue card on your next turn of the die. These Quest cards are simply small stories of things; of adventures in Mallory’s book titled King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. And each answer is either a yes or a no. No harder then this. A player on the Virtue pace may choose not to use The Quest cards and can choose instead to use any of Great Thoughts, The Rest or Science Notes cards and simply make an original statement or ask a Kids Corner question as the case maybe to start a conversation and set voting or the jubilance rule for the conversation in motion in their attempt to gain their Virtue card.
More than one player may be positioned on a Pillar of Virtue at any one time. A player who has collected all seven Virtue cards immediately heads for Camelot and the Round Table. Being your original starting outer playing board corner position. Players must on their turn of arriving back home tell a story based on one of the virtues displayed on the Virtue Cards or on one of the dictionary definitions of the word Virtue. Examples given: Excellence, worth, the practice of duty, a good quality and an accomplishment. The characters you use may be real or imaginary. An Animal, mammal, insect or cartoon. The player may mime, dance, act out a part, impersonate a hero, and draw from legend, fable, or poem. The sky is the limit. Be creative, explore! And you can use your time outside the game to think up your Virtue story ending. You do not have to tell your story right away, you may wait until the turn of your own making best suiting you being ready. Improvisation can be the key. Just pick a word. Another player commenting on a quotation or something perhaps of the adventures of Sir Lancelot or of the Lady Dinrane. As your friend. Or as Morpheus put it to Neo, ""you think it's air you are breathing"". Say anything even absolutely outrageous and stop them in their tracks. At the end of some absolutely outrageous story of complete and utter unbelievableness. Add at the finish . . . oh and one last thing. You can’t believe a thing I say. How cool is Sangreal? Your five to fifteen minutes of fame awaits.
Audience! One sphere in the cup will show our storyteller or actor your
appreciation. You win the Sangreal prize by majority rule, example given, if there are five players then at least three spheres must enter the Sangreal Cup. Also players prior to starting the game. May designate the winner to be the first player to collect seven ""Virtue"" cards, reach Camelot their home starting corner and dramatize a Virtue with at least some degree of earnestness. Player's can discuss the way the game shall end and the winner found before play begins and vote on the decision with the voting spheres until a majority is reached.
Finally. Another twist is to use the board for a first player round the seven Pillars and home again wins the game. Leaving your pawn play pieces as you go, plotting the course you reason to be the shortest route home. (This version does not use the games cards. Sangreal Cup or voting spheres). When a player completes their story without victory there’s no time to bleat; to get back on your feet its focus you need to bring together a new act, line, mime, Rhyme, story, or chorus line. So change tack and select another virtue and before you know it you'll be back on stage, the set lit up and this time it's Ground Hog Day. By now you will have worked it out. It's communication, open minded, trusting, honest, to goodness, communication being the key to the Sangreal Round Table Harmony. And to the winner  take a bow  it’s customary somehow! Sangreal . . . some do . . . some don't have a beautiful mind! Introducing The Board Game Sangreal:

OF LANCELOT, GUINEVERE AND KING   A R T H U R How Lancelot fell to his old love again but withdrew from Guinevere to eschew slander. And how the queen commanded him to respect the way of play! So after the quest of Sangreal was fulfilled and all knights left alive were come again unto the Table Round as the rule book of the Way of Play of Sangreal maketh mention. Then was there great joy in the court and in especial King Arthur and Queen Guinevere made great joy of the remnant home and passing glad was the king and the queen of Sir Lancelot and of Sir Bors for they had been passing long in the quest of winning the Sangreal. Then as the Great Thoughts card saith Sir Lancelot began to lament and pine for his true love but Queen Guinevere open-mouthed put her foot down and suggested it was time to allow others the opportunity to play Sangreal. How Sir Galahad, Sir Bors, Merlin, Morgan le Fay, and Sir Percival entered into the game and of The Rest card and of how king Pelles had been maimed for drawing it. 
In the meanwhile Galahad blessed him by placing a sphere in the Sangreal cup. Then next the gentlewoman Morgan Le Fay and then Sir Bors and Sir Percival threw the two dice and when they were playing it was so marvelous fair and rich they marveled at the midst of the game was fairness and Galahad went thereto and found there a crown of virtue. At the feet was a sword rich and fair and it was drawn out of the sheath half a foot and more and the sword was of divers fashions and the pommel was of stone and there was in him all manner of colors being any man might find and every charge of the color had divers virtues. How Sir Lancelot half sleeping and half walking saw a sick man healed of dullness by playing Sangreal into the wee small hours. How Merlin announced to King Arthur the `SANGREAL BOARD GAME' should be played throughout the Realm. And how King Arthur had all his knights together for to practice being not angry and never to laugh at anything before they departed. And how expressions of ability appeared in the knights and in the ladies as they sat at supper and how all the knights took upon themselves the quest to prove, to have patience where woman are concerned; should become a virtue too. Porthole and Periscope on The Game Sangreal play brings about a supernormal believing in yourself and in your abilities and what you can achieve. Sangreal play brings about a supernormal taking control for yourself and of yourself in every aspect of your life. Sangreal play brings about coolness without being cocky and a strong-willed, feisty, friendly and fun sensuality. Sangreal play brings about a supernormal realization of your personality inside of you and of loving the new you. Sangreal play brings about a supernormal leaning into synchronicity towards someone you are interested in to show you are being engaged by what they are saying. Sangreal play brings about a supernormal sense you are a great slow and controlled talker. Sangreal play brings about a supernormal watching to see whether others are copying your Sangreal style.

Sue said, “Well I’m really surprised by how much I’ve learned
about you two today, and I think Sangreal’s the kind of game that gets you
talking to each other”.
Bonne said, “Yeah”.
Sue said, “And not so much about yourself, although of course
Sangreal’s about you, Sangreal is about what you share, but things a little
more than ourselves”.
Jenah said, “I learned something about you too”.
Sue said, “Ah cool, yeah I love that about Sangreal, it’s
amazing”.
Bonne said, “Sangreal’s a game that you can learn from,
Sangreal sort of opens up conversations on topics about people that you may
know but also things like Sangreal sort of brings in topics that are not that
usually spoken about or wouldn’t usually or come up in a conversation”.
Sue said, “Yeah”.
Bonne said,  “Sangreal
kind of opens up your world, and Sangreal’s kind of good though because you get
to exercise different thought processes”.
Sue said, “Yeah that you wouldn’t normally “.
Bonne said, “Like the cards you bring out, like you really have
to think sometimes”.
Jenah said, “Sangreal gives people a chance to say something
without prejudice and they can say something honestly they think without people
having to go on a huge debate against them or Sangreal’s just hearing peoples
ideas which is nice”!
Sue said, “Yeah, perspective”.
Bonne said, “I quite like the fact that Sangreal is not
competitive, because most games out there are and these games depends on who
you play with, it can ruin the game if your playing with someone who is really
competitive or is a really bad, you know a poor loser, but because Sangreal’s a
game where everyone is equal at the same time and that includes everyone when
it is your turn as well, Sangreal’s quite enjoyable”.

co-operation, Sangreal’s cool”!

Four planets have been threatened by five obscure videogame bosses.<br/>Each planet has its own army but this has been broken and now all the negative effects are woven together to create chaos.<br/><br/>SEEP, an indie developer team, has intercepted the code in the timeline that is causing the disaster. The problem seems to be the corruption of the source code of some old arcade systems, these can also teleport people from one place to another where the code is corrupted.<br/><br/>So the brothers Sergio and Enrico, members of SEEP, decide to go into action. Only they can save the universe by crossing through various arcade systems that have been hacked by a mysterious AI.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1274874/files/20150306175842-mondi3.jpg?1425693522"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div></div>","Here you can vote the game on Steam Greenlight: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=423573440
Here you can try a little DEMO: http://gamejolt.com/games/arcade/seep-universe-demo/60444/


SEEP Universe is an action-platform game for the PC inspired by the 8-16 bit era created by SEEP.Originally we released SEEP World, a free indie fan game inspired by 8 bit games.After achieving a good response with that, we decided to make a really professional game with a similiar concept to create a new brand.So SEEP Universe is a 100% original game with a new script (total rewrite with many features), a new collision system, two characters in one, 6 buttons (jump, run, punch attack, power up and change character), puzzle element andexclusive enemies, story and power up.
VIDEO GAMEPLAY:
   A strange frequency from the videogame world has taken control of the universe. Four planets have been threatened by five obscure videogame bosses.Each planet has its own army but this has been broken and now all the negative effects are woven together to create chaos.SEEP, an indie developer team, has intercepted the code in the timeline that is causing the disaster. The problem seems to be the corruption of the source code of some old arcade systems, these can also teleport people from one place to another where the code is corrupted.So the brothers Sergio and Enrico, members of SEEP, decide to go into action. Only they can save the universe by crossing through various arcade systems that have been hacked by a mysterious AI.
SEEP Universe allows the exploration of four bizzarre planets, inspired by retro games.Run, Jump and battle enemies through more than 20 stages for a 100% retro feeling. This is the game you have always dreamed of from the 16 bit era!The battles against the bosses change the rules of the game. For example, in the first world you'll need to run away with a SEEP car from a huge boss.This makes the game experience varied and intriguing!You can also collect the SEEP Coins to unlock many secrets in the SEEPedia, a huge gallery where you can discover many secrets.The goal of SEEP Universe is to bring back all of the retro feeling in a new indie game!We're also thinking of adding 2-player mode for more fun!
FEATURES:
100% pixel art for a 100% retro feeling.
Original soundtrack product by Pedro Calquinha and André Marques, two professional musicians, with the collaboration of Amadis Monteiro (drums).
Funny 8 bit sound effects.
Two characters in one with different skills.

</h3><h3><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/AlienHamsterBall"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><font color=""#3B5998"">&gt;&gt;&gt; PLEASE SUPPORT US BY JOINING OUR FACEBOOK FANPAGE! &lt;&lt;&lt;</font></a></h3><h3>More about Alien Hamster Ball!!</h3>
<p>Hopefully, the trailer gave you a good overview of who we are and what we
are trying to do. However, I know how boring it can be to listen to me talking
the whole time, since I unfortunately don't possess the Hollywood actor skill set,
so I figured I would share some extra, more detailed information about the game
for those who are interested! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><u>The Hamster Story</u></b></p>
<p>Our cute, naughty and sometimes even rude little alien hamster friends come
from the planet Squeek in a far far away galaxy called Furratron. Due to the
invention of a new type of spaceship, they could travel through the universe
quickly and easily. Many hamsters started on an adventure, to find resources
and explore other planets. The problem is, when their spaceships entered the
earth's atmosphere, a lot of parts were burned and spread throughout the world!
Will you help them find the parts &amp; resources so they can continue their
adventure?</p><p><br/></p><p><img align=""none"" alt=""Story"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.xeative.com/indiegogo/comic.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><u>Hamster Personalities</u></b></p>
<p>We are really trying to give our players the option to make their hamsters
the way they want them to be! That's why we implemented different personality
types to suit your taste of hamsters. You can own more than 1 hamster, so you
don't have to stick to only the 1 personality! Below you can see a list of the
different personality types.</p>
<p>- Tough &amp; Angry</p>
<p>- Relaxed Surfer</p>
<p>- Cute &amp; Cuddly</p>
<p>- Sexy &amp; Naughty</p>
<p>- Nerdy</p>
<p>- No personality</p>
<p>Each personality is matched with its own unique phrases and texts (with the
exception of the last one of course). Sometimes, when you ignore the hamsters
for too long, they will let you know that they need some attention! Other
times, they might make some remarks during the game.</p><p><br/></p><p><img align=""none"" alt=""Gameplay1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.xeative.com/indiegogo/1.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><u>Customization Features</u></b></p>
<p>With these features, we really went crazy! Not only do we give our players
the option to completely adapt the look and feel of their hamsters, but we even
took the liberty of allowing everybody to create and decorate the hamsters
space stations! </p>
<p>You can completely change your hamster in every single way. Keep it simple,
if this is not your thing then don't spend too much time on it. If it is
however, you can go as far as fur colours, different eyes, glasses, ear rings,
shoes, gloves, hats, tattoos, piercings, necklaces, even accesoires like iPods
&amp; much much more!!</p>
<p>For the Space Stations, you have a choice between different types of rooms
(space stations) and heaps of furniture, gadgets and futuristic gimmicks. Of
course, all styled and designed for the comfort of your hamster!</p><p><br/></p><p><img align=""none"" alt=""Gameplay2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.xeative.com/indiegogo/2.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><u>The Main Game &amp; Gameplay</u></b></p>
<p>Okay, now we can get to the real stuff. Like we explained a little bit in
our trailer, there will be different types of game modes &amp; themes. For the
main game, the hamsters will go on their adventure across earth. In a sort of
Super Mario, Donkey Kong &amp; Sonic type of gameplay, you have to manouvre
through different obstacles, collect as many points as possible and defeat some
monsters that cross your path. In total, we want to launch the game with 
different themes, each having a day and night version. Each day and night
version will feature roughly 6 different levels, depending on the support we
get! This also means, it could turn out to be much more! We will update our Facebook
page regularly, to let you know what the themes are and to give a sneak peak of
what they will look like!</p>
<p>You can play the game alone, on your phone when you're travelling, when you
have a spare minute while cooking or basically at any other given moment when
you find the time. However, we also implemented a multiplayer feature to all
the levels. This is where you can compete <b>both</b> with and against your
friends. Practice first on your own, then compete against your friends or
random players, or of course, just skip the practicing altogether!</p><p><br/></p><p><img align=""none"" alt=""Gameplay3"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.xeative.com/indiegogo/3.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><u>Multiplayer Minigames</u></b></p>
<p>To really add some excitement into the mix, we want to implement some
minigames! All these minigames will be playable against other people and
against your friends. These games are meant to add something new to the mix and
to enhance the player to player interaction! We have many minigames already
conceptualized but we really need your support to get them made! Again, we will
release the minigame sneak peaks at a later stage, but i will list 2 games
below to give you an idea of what we have in store for you!</p>
<p><b>- Capture the Flag (play 3 vs 3, or 5 vs 5)</b></p>
<p>I'm sure we all know capture the flag, now we want to deliver this fun game
in an alien hamster varient. How will it work?: The level will be one
giant arena and completely symmetrical so that there are no unfair advantages
to either team. The object of the game is to collect the opponents flag at
their base and safely bring it back to your own base. You need to make sure
though, that your own flag is still at your base! During the game, you can
knock your opponents off the map by rolling into them. The harder you roll, the
harder you will knock into the opposing players! When a player gets knocked off
the map, he or she will have to wait 15 seconds, before respawning. Also, as a
nice addition we have death pits and special boosts spread across the map to
enhance the fun! After a team has collected the opponents flag 3 times, the
game is over. We also put a time limit of 5 minutes on it to make sure you're
not stuck in the game forever if the teams are too evenly matched!</p>
<p><b>- Dodge it! (play 1 vs 1)</b></p>
<p>Set up a game with another player or by yourself and dodge the falling objects! It really
is that simple. However, we added some extra's to it of course! There will be
point multiplyers, lasting up to 10 seconds and every time you get hit, you get
minus points and lose a life. You can set up a game with a time-cap or until you lost all your lives.<br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is much more to tell but i have to leave some spoilers for the future,
which I can do with some nice graphics. Hopefully, this sparked some interest

Hopefully, the trailer gave you a good overview of who we are and what we
are trying to do. However, I know how boring it can be to listen to me talking
the whole time, since I unfortunately don't possess the Hollywood actor skill set,
so I figured I would share some extra, more detailed information about the game
for those who are interested! 
 
The Hamster Story
Our cute, naughty and sometimes even rude little alien hamster friends come
from the planet Squeek in a far far away galaxy called Furratron. Due to the
invention of a new type of spaceship, they could travel through the universe
quickly and easily. Many hamsters started on an adventure, to find resources
and explore other planets. The problem is, when their spaceships entered the
earth's atmosphere, a lot of parts were burned and spread throughout the world!
Will you help them find the parts & resources so they can continue their
adventure?
 
Hamster Personalities
We are really trying to give our players the option to make their hamsters
the way they want them to be! That's why we implemented different personality
types to suit your taste of hamsters. You can own more than 1 hamster, so you
don't have to stick to only the 1 personality! Below you can see a list of the
different personality types.
- Tough & Angry
- Relaxed Surfer
- Cute & Cuddly
- Sexy & Naughty
- Nerdy
- No personality
Each personality is matched with its own unique phrases and texts (with the
exception of the last one of course). Sometimes, when you ignore the hamsters
for too long, they will let you know that they need some attention! Other
times, they might make some remarks during the game.
 
Customization Features
With these features, we really went crazy! Not only do we give our players
the option to completely adapt the look and feel of their hamsters, but we even
took the liberty of allowing everybody to create and decorate the hamsters
space stations! 
You can completely change your hamster in every single way. Keep it simple,
if this is not your thing then don't spend too much time on it. If it is
however, you can go as far as fur colours, different eyes, glasses, ear rings,
shoes, gloves, hats, tattoos, piercings, necklaces, even accesoires like iPods
& much much more!!
For the Space Stations, you have a choice between different types of rooms
(space stations) and heaps of furniture, gadgets and futuristic gimmicks. Of
course, all styled and designed for the comfort of your hamster!
 
The Main Game & Gameplay
Okay, now we can get to the real stuff. Like we explained a little bit in

<br/><h3><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">We Want to Bring Back Serious Handheld Gaming <br/></span></span></h3>
We are trying to bring serious gaming back to the handheld world, in its current form, the android market is filled to the brim with mini-games and coffee-break-fillers. A major part of what we're trying to achieve, is to show the mobile device world that real substantial mobile gaming still has a place.
<p>But not just that.</p>
<p>We're developing a Strategy game for the Android tablet <a href=""http://gyozabot.com/2012/04/06/seculus-for-phones-too-12/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>(and now smartphone!)</strong></a> platform, but with a twist. Our game has a compelling and relevant theme, one of the major issues of our time, Secularism. In a world where religious extremism has visibly scarred people everywhere, we believe it's important for us to, if only just for a second, consider the ramifications of holding onto an extremist view on religion, whether it be militant atheism, true agnostic indifference or condoning religious violence. It's a serious topic, and we want to create a game with the potential to ""accidentally educate"" people while they're enjoying themselves. </p>
<p>If you can help us make this happen, you'll not only be taking a first step towards a more gamer-friendly mobile world but also, you'll be helping us to plant a seed in the back of peoples minds, and we believe that that is where gamings true power lies. The power to influence people.</p>
<p>We know what we need to do, we just need the power to do it, and that is why we've started this campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Seculus: A Story of Science and Religion</h3>
<p>Long have we discussed and debated ""Science vs Religion"", but can such a thing even exist? When discussing classic religion, inevitably, the popularized conflict with scientific knowledge is apparent. In our world, discussion pertaining to Creationism vs Evolution, the age of the earth and even the existence of life on other planets is constantly disputed by religious communities, and it is commonly believed that those with faith cannot be recognised scientifically. Science and Religion are two concepts which are often considered opposite, this misconception needs to be broken.</p>
<p>While extremism is commonly attributed to conflict in the middle east and terrorism, extreme belief, leading to violence, exists in every part of the world. This theme is reflected in our game, through the people and characters within.</p>
<p>The story involves three vastly contrasting nations, that attempt to reflect religion, atheism and agnosticism in their most extreme forms. The player takes on the role of a key group from each perspective during the breakout of a religious war, their decisions shape the story, and in each possible outcome, the player is exposed to the possible consequences of their decisions.</p>
<p>The largest nation, Vattinus, is an entirely anti-secular society. It is militantly religious to the point of extremism. Reminiscent of some of the current middle eastern societies, their laws correlate with sin, and subsequently they believe all others are damned. Our first character, a hot-headed squire, hails from here. By beginning the game here, the player will follow the squire in his solo crusade to stop the heathens from other societies, and eventually be forced to question his beliefs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://gyozabot.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/knightlowres.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 283px; height: 371px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second largest group can only loosely be called a ""nation"". The Nomads of the Oddlands, opportunists in nature, don't concern themselves with the existence of a god or gods. They are only interested in what is now, and what will be soon. Sometimes referred to as ""the floating country"", the Odd drift in position over time, finding new places to spread to. They are known for their live-off-the-land style, and their culture is famous for their hunting and survival prowess. Our second character hails from here, a loyal but quiet soul. She leaves the nomadic herd in search of her brother, and an explanation for the recent destruction of nearby forestland.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://gyozabot.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/archerlowres.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 289px; height: 380px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The last, and smallest, group are known as Cord. Their noocratic government is based entirely on logic, reason and scientific knowledge. Even the least intelligent Cordians have intelligence far greater than anything we know. To them, physics and what we would call ""magic"" are one and the same. Sporting mana-powered ""electronics"" and an almost futuristic culture, Cord is advanced enough to have their own space program, while the other nations still toy with steam power. Their society is totally secular, and dominantly anti-religious, leading to internal conflict between theists and atheist subcultures, and religious persecution, much like our world. Because of the anti-theist majority, tension between them and Vattinus is not insignificant, the erection of their mana-barrier is evident of this. Our last character hails from here, a stubborn, arrogant, know-it-all teenager, who believes he can solve the nations issues on his own, and desperate to prove himself to his peers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://gyozabot.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/magelowres.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 291px; height: 382px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our story begins when Cord launches its first satellite into space. The government of Vattinus see this as an insult to their beliefs, some believe it to be an assault on the heavens themselves. While they plan their crusade, the nomads of the Oddlands are forced to abandon their usual indifference when areas of their homeland begin disappearing. While the high mages of Cord stay quiet to the world, and discuss their own agenda.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<h3>The Game</h3>
<p><img alt=""A mock-up map scene, a few sprites from an isometric view."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://gyozabot.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/fulldemogrid.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A 2D, Pixel-Graphics, Pro-Nostalgia, Retro styled strategy game. It uses an awesome combination of real-time and turn-based mechanics, and is infused heavily with RPG elements. A class-based system of character progression and a huge class tree to go with it. Player choice is also a key feature of the game, with many different ways of building the same classes and characters, equipment customization, 3 intertwined non-linear campaigns and player driven party system.</p>
<p>The player controls an RPG style party. As the campaign progresses, the player moved from country to country, city to city, conquering strategic locations and objectives by deploying their party to a location and accomplishing the given objective (e.g. capturing an objective or defeating an army). A player does this by moving their units on a grid, and attacking other units using spells or weaponry. From a gameplay perspective, a unique feature of our game is the use of Action gauges for turn-based play. Instead of classical turn-by-turn movement, each unit moves at their own interval, some will take more turns than others (like the fast paced archers of the Oddlands) and some will be slower but more powerful (like the gargantuan knights of Ager Vattinus). In addition, each member of the players party grows and develops individually, gaining experience and stats like traditional RPG games. They can be promoted through ranks and will develop new skills and abilities. The player can create new units to add to their party to suit their needs and preferred strategies. The over-world map also features many bonus levels and side missions, designed to give the player a broad view of the game world as well as the finer more detailed aspects of war, and how individuals are affected.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>In order to completely flesh out the game with everything we've designed, we'd need $10,435, but we understand that this is a HUGE request, so we've edited and trimmed the designs to the point where we could ship the game, maintaining its ambitious goals, for $8500. At least to us, its still a huge amount of money to ask for. Because the minimum shippable game we've designed can ship for $5500, we've decided to set our campaign goal to $6000 so we can afford to send out gifts and thanks.<br/><p>The money would go towards commissioning the rest of the animations and sprites for the game. We've invested a great deal of time searching for low-cost solutions and we have found many (Like the fantastic <a href=""http://www.nosoapradio.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">NoSoapRadio</a> and their free video game music), but animation is the one thing that we cannot work around if we want our game to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>If you can help us see this through, you'll have access to heaps of concept art and lore before the game is released, and the more generous will have the chance to add their own personal touch to the game. The reason we haven't listed per-ordering as a perk, is because the android market doesn't support promotional codes. To account for this, we've decided that if we make it to our $6000 goal, we'll give the game away for free for the first 2 weeks of release. Even after that, we intend to sell the game in its entirety for $2 or less<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">We may even give it away for Free</span>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're not in this for the money, we're in this for the message. We believe in the freedom of games, especially those with important themes.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Update 1: We've decided that every penny earned from the fruition of this project will go to other IndieGoGo/Kickstarter Game-Dev projects or Indie Developers in need. In this effort, we hope to not just encourage the freedom of games, but to actually enforce it.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we can get within a few hundred dollars of our $8500 goal, we'll ship the game with everything we can. We'll create the best experience we can muster and launch it with the hope of making an impact.</p>
<p>If we make it past the $5500 mark, we'll persist. We'll try to ship a condensed version of the game with fewer characters, and it'll let us know that there are people out there who are interested in seeing this game through, we'll keep trying to find the money, even if we have to release the game piece by piece. </p>
<p>If we end up with less than $3000, we won't try and strip the game down any further. It's important to us that this game has impact, so we'll give the money to charity that can make an impact in its place. It'll be a charity of your choosing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Update 1: As part of our decision, we've decided that if we don't make it to our goal we'll give the remaining funds to other game dev projects. We'll ask the community of contributors where they believe the money should go too.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Update 2: Since we've recieved massive physical donations, our total target has been reduced to $4500, see the Updates tab for more info!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Update 4: We've hit $3000: WE CAN PUBLISH! With this milestone under our belts, we can ship a version of the game with a linear campaign and a 13-Class character tree. This version of the game has been designed to be the smallest publishable game that can still feel like a complete experience. Thank you all so much for your support!<br/></span></span></p>

We can't update our target since the campaign is already underway, but know that we're now we're shooting for $4500 total instead of $6000. See the update tab for more info!
 
UPDATE 3 - 24/03/2012: We've hit $2000! Thanks guys!
 
UPDATE 4 - 04/03/2012: We've hit $3000! We can publish! Reaching our first publishing milestone means the game will feature a single linear campaign and a reduced class pool, but will still feel like a complete experience. Help us reach our $6000 target so we can really push the intense themes we've talked about! Thank you all for your support so far, we couldn't do this without you, and we are truely greatful!
 
UPDATE 5 - 06/04/2012: Seculus will be available for High-End Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) Smartphones too! More information on the Dev blog

 
UPDATE 6 - 08/04/2012: Added a little Mock-Map to the Game section to give everyone a better idea of our style.
 
UPDATE 7 - So, the campaign has ended, and we've raised more than enough money to continue with production. I want to thank everyone for contributing. We're eternally greatful. Be sure to keep up with the Development blog, Gyozabot.com, and like the facebook page to get more info on the game from here on out.
We Want to Bring Back Serious Handheld Gaming 
We are trying to bring serious gaming back to the handheld world, in its current form, the android market is filled to the brim with mini-games and coffee-break-fillers. A major part of what we're trying to achieve, is to show the mobile device world that real substantial mobile gaming still has a place.
But not just that.
We're developing a Strategy game for the Android tablet (and now smartphone!) platform, but with a twist. Our game has a compelling and relevant theme, one of the major issues of our time, Secularism. In a world where religious extremism has visibly scarred people everywhere, we believe it's important for us to, if only just for a second, consider the ramifications of holding onto an extremist view on religion, whether it be militant atheism, true agnostic indifference or condoning religious violence. It's a serious topic, and we want to create a game with the potential to ""accidentally educate"" people while they're enjoying themselves. 
If you can help us make this happen, you'll not only be taking a first step towards a more gamer-friendly mobile world but also, you'll be helping us to plant a seed in the back of peoples minds, and we believe that that is where gamings true power lies. The power to influence people.
We know what we need to do, we just need the power to do it, and that is why we've started this campaign.
 
Seculus: A Story of Science and Religion
Long have we discussed and debated ""Science vs Religion"", but can such a thing even exist? When discussing classic religion, inevitably, the popularized conflict with scientific knowledge is apparent. In our world, discussion pertaining to Creationism vs Evolution, the age of the earth and even the existence of life on other planets is constantly disputed by religious communities, and it is commonly believed that those with faith cannot be recognised scientifically. Science and Religion are two concepts which are often considered opposite, this misconception needs to be broken.
While extremism is commonly attributed to conflict in the middle east and terrorism, extreme belief, leading to violence, exists in every part of the world. This theme is reflected in our game, through the people and characters within.
The story involves three vastly contrasting nations, that attempt to reflect religion, atheism and agnosticism in their most extreme forms. The player takes on the role of a key group from each perspective during the breakout of a religious war, their decisions shape the story, and in each possible outcome, the player is exposed to the possible consequences of their decisions.
The largest nation, Vattinus, is an entirely anti-secular society. It is militantly religious to the point of extremism. Reminiscent of some of the current middle eastern societies, their laws correlate with sin, and subsequently they believe all others are damned. Our first character, a hot-headed squire, hails from here. By beginning the game here, the player will follow the squire in his solo crusade to stop the heathens from other societies, and eventually be forced to question his beliefs.

 
The second largest group can only loosely be called a ""nation"". The Nomads of the Oddlands, opportunists in nature, don't concern themselves with the existence of a god or gods. They are only interested in what is now, and what will be soon. Sometimes referred to as ""the floating country"", the Odd drift in position over time, finding new places to spread to. They are known for their live-off-the-land style, and their culture is famous for their hunting and survival prowess. Our second character hails from here, a loyal but quiet soul. She leaves the nomadic herd in search of her brother, and an explanation for the recent destruction of nearby forestland.

 
The last, and smallest, group are known as Cord. Their noocratic government is based entirely on logic, reason and scientific knowledge. Even the least intelligent Cordians have intelligence far greater than anything we know. To them, physics and what we would call ""magic"" are one and the same. Sporting mana-powered ""electronics"" and an almost futuristic culture, Cord is advanced enough to have their own space program, while the other nations still toy with steam power. Their society is totally secular, and dominantly anti-religious, leading to internal conflict between theists and atheist subcultures, and religious persecution, much like our world. Because of the anti-theist majority, tension between them and Vattinus is not insignificant, the erection of their mana-barrier is evident of this. Our last character hails from here, a stubborn, arrogant, know-it-all teenager, who believes he can solve the nations issues on his own, and desperate to prove himself to his peers.

 
Our story begins when Cord launches its first satellite into space. The government of Vattinus see this as an insult to their beliefs, some believe it to be an assault on the heavens themselves. While they plan their crusade, the nomads of the Oddlands are forced to abandon their usual indifference when areas of their homeland begin disappearing. While the high mages of Cord stay quiet to the world, and discuss their own agenda.

The Game

A 2D, Pixel-Graphics, Pro-Nostalgia, Retro styled strategy game. It uses an awesome combination of real-time and turn-based mechanics, and is infused heavily with RPG elements. A class-based system of character progression and a huge class tree to go with it. Player choice is also a key feature of the game, with many different ways of building the same classes and characters, equipment customization, 3 intertwined non-linear campaigns and player driven party system.
The player controls an RPG style party. As the campaign progresses, the player moved from country to country, city to city, conquering strategic locations and objectives by deploying their party to a location and accomplishing the given objective (e.g. capturing an objective or defeating an army). A player does this by moving their units on a grid, and attacking other units using spells or weaponry. From a gameplay perspective, a unique feature of our game is the use of Action gauges for turn-based play. Instead of classical turn-by-turn movement, each unit moves at their own interval, some will take more turns than others (like the fast paced archers of the Oddlands) and some will be slower but more powerful (like the gargantuan knights of Ager Vattinus). In addition, each member of the players party grows and develops individually, gaining experience and stats like traditional RPG games. They can be promoted through ranks and will develop new skills and abilities. The player can create new units to add to their party to suit their needs and preferred strategies. The over-world map also features many bonus levels and side missions, designed to give the player a broad view of the game world as well as the finer more detailed aspects of war, and how individuals are affected.

What We Need & What You Get

In order to completely flesh out the game with everything we've designed, we'd need $10,435, but we understand that this is a HUGE request, so we've edited and trimmed the designs to the point where we could ship the game, maintaining its ambitious goals, for $8500. At least to us, its still a huge amount of money to ask for. Because the minimum shippable game we've designed can ship for $5500, we've decided to set our campaign goal to $6000 so we can afford to send out gifts and thanks.The money would go towards commissioning the rest of the animations and sprites for the game. We've invested a great deal of time searching for low-cost solutions and we have found many (Like the fantastic NoSoapRadio and their free video game music), but animation is the one thing that we cannot work around if we want our game to be taken seriously.
If you can help us see this through, you'll have access to heaps of concept art and lore before the game is released, and the more generous will have the chance to add their own personal touch to the game. The reason we haven't listed per-ordering as a perk, is because the android market doesn't support promotional codes. To account for this, we've decided that if we make it to our $6000 goal, we'll give the game away for free for the first 2 weeks of release. Even after that, we intend to sell the game in its entirety for $2 or less.

We may even give it away for Free.
 
We're not in this for the money, we're in this for the message. We believe in the freedom of games, especially those with important themes.
 
Update 1: We've decided that every penny earned from the fruition of this project will go to other IndieGoGo/Kickstarter Game-Dev projects or Indie Developers in need. In this effort, we hope to not just encourage the freedom of games, but to actually enforce it.
 
If we can get within a few hundred dollars of our $8500 goal, we'll ship the game with everything we can. We'll create the best experience we can muster and launch it with the hope of making an impact.
If we make it past the $5500 mark, we'll persist. We'll try to ship a condensed version of the game with fewer characters, and it'll let us know that there are people out there who are interested in seeing this game through, we'll keep trying to find the money, even if we have to release the game piece by piece. 
If we end up with less than $3000, we won't try and strip the game down any further. It's important to us that this game has impact, so we'll give the money to charity that can make an impact in its place. It'll be a charity of your choosing.
 
Update 1: As part of our decision, we've decided that if we don't make it to our goal we'll give the remaining funds to other game dev projects. We'll ask the community of contributors where they believe the money should go too.

Update 2: Since we've recieved massive physical donations, our total target has been reduced to $4500, see the Updates tab for more info!

Update 4: We've hit $3000: WE CAN PUBLISH! With this milestone under our belts, we can ship a version of the game with a linear campaign and a 13-Class character tree. This version of the game has been designed to be the smallest publishable game that can still feel like a complete experience. Thank you all so much for your support!

<p><strong>No-Dice.Net</strong> is an ambitious project to modernize tabletop gaming.  It will be a central hub for dungeon masters and players to store character sheets, create battle maps, develop new game rules, plan campaigns, and find groups.</p>
<p><span>Because of No Dice's rule set creation engine, any rule set can be supported with a little work, but there will also be pre-built sets available for purchase. These rule sets won't cover every aspect of a given game, but they will cover character generation and leveling.</span></p>
<p><span>All of our tools will be accessible through an open API to allow easy integration within other sites and applications.</span></p>
<p><span>No Dice, LLC will also be developing a standard XML data format for characters, rulesets, and maps so that other applications can be made compatible.</span></p>

<p>The profile/badges will be delivered as soon as you set up an account on our site and e-mail us. It's bare-bones, but you can collect the badges. That's all that matters, right?</p>
<p>Also, if you earned a 3D portrait, our in-house 3D Artist/User Interaction Specialist will also contact you as soon as the payment goes through for details about your custom portrait.</p>
<p>The rest of the rewards won't be fully deliverable until after the campaign when the site is fully functional and all that.  All ""Epic Level"" memberships will be valid as soon as you sign up for an account, but the time countdown for them (if applicable) won't start until after the beta is over.</p>
<h2>Rules Customization Sandbox</h2>
<p>At the heart of our application is our rules customization feature. You can take any existing ruleset and build your own “layer” on top of it and share it with all the players in your campaign. You can also choose which rulesets you want to include in a given campaign, or even use a custom ruleset of your own design.</p>

<p>If we get the full amount, we will be able to work on this project full time for long enough to complete this in half the time.  If we don't get the full amount, we will still be able to complete the project, and will be able to devote more time to it, so your funds will not be wasted.  Plus, we will make you nice things in exchange.</p>

</div></div>","No-Dice.Net is an ambitious project to modernize tabletop gaming.  It will be a central hub for dungeon masters and players to store character sheets, create battle maps, develop new game rules, plan campaigns, and find groups.
Because of No Dice's rule set creation engine, any rule set can be supported with a little work, but there will also be pre-built sets available for purchase. These rule sets won't cover every aspect of a given game, but they will cover character generation and leveling.
All of our tools will be accessible through an open API to allow easy integration within other sites and applications.
No Dice, LLC will also be developing a standard XML data format for characters, rulesets, and maps so that other applications can be made compatible.
A Note about the rewards:

The profile/badges will be delivered as soon as you set up an account on our site and e-mail us. It's bare-bones, but you can collect the badges. That's all that matters, right?
Also, if you earned a 3D portrait, our in-house 3D Artist/User Interaction Specialist will also contact you as soon as the payment goes through for details about your custom portrait.
The rest of the rewards won't be fully deliverable until after the campaign when the site is fully functional and all that.  All ""Epic Level"" memberships will be valid as soon as you sign up for an account, but the time countdown for them (if applicable) won't start until after the beta is over.
Rules Customization Sandbox
At the heart of our application is our rules customization feature. You can take any existing ruleset and build your own “layer” on top of it and share it with all the players in your campaign. You can also choose which rulesets you want to include in a given campaign, or even use a custom ruleset of your own design.

Start From Scratch
Add Your Own “House Rules” to an Existing Game
Share With Your Group for Easy Play-Testing

Character Creation Tools
Character Creation will be available for most popular rulesets, along with the ability to redesign and theme the templates so that you can have all the information you need where you want. Your possibilities are endless!
Map Making Tools
We’re going to feature powerful on-line map-creation tools, and we’re hoping to make official content available for all the major game rulesets as well as our favorite weird independent stuff.

Library of Free Basic Tile Sets
Support for Uploading Your Own Tiles
Store for Buying Additional Tile Sets

Campaign Tracking Tools
Our Campaign tools will let you keep your players updated with a blog and/or newsletter.

Tools for Keeping Campaign Notes
Campaign Blogs/Newsletters


Social Network for Traditional Gamers
No-dice.net will feature many social aspects to connect players. You’ll be able to share your campaign, character sheet, etc with the world, and keep track of your gaming group.

Video Chat/Collaboration Plug-Ins for On-line Play
Badges/Achievement System
Campaigns can be marked “LFG” and Searchable
Integration With All Major Social Platforms

<h1>Game Overview</h1>
<p>Casey Powell Lacrosse 16 is a console sports simulation where authentic lacrosse gameplay, high quality graphics, multi-year dynasty mode, competitive online multiplayer, real-time RPG leveling, and in-depth character customization are seamlessly integrated and delivered over Xbox, PlayStation, and the PC.</p><br/><h1>Gameplay:</h1>
<p>Lacrosse 16 combines the player movement and passing of basketball with the stick control, shooting, and hitting of hockey to create a high scoring, action-packed lacrosse video game.</p>
<p>• High Scoring: Say goodbye to that “I can’t score” feeling of standard sports video games. Lacrosse averages 20+ goals per game. Get ready to sting corners!</p>
<p>• Big Hits: Line up the ball carrier for huge hits by perfectly timing up your attack. Imagine a football linebacker with a titanium shaft. Lay him down!</p>
<p>• Combination Stick Checks: Strip the ball away from the offense with various sword-like stick checks. Slice and dice!</p>
<p>• Evasive Dodging: Execute combination dodge moves to work your way past the defense. Lacrosse players are pure athletes. First you break their ankles, and then you break their heart.</p>
<p>• Quick Stick Passing: Perform amazingly accurate and fast passing to exploit your opponents. Tic-tac-toe anyone?</p>
<p>• Face-offs: Control every movement of your players stick in first person face-offs. Clamp, pinch and pop, laser? Its in your hands!</p>
<p>• Groundballs: Decide if you are going to pick up the ball with two hands, one hand, or go for the quick Indian pickup. The team who wins the GB battles, wins the war!</p>
<p>• Transition Offense: The team who knows how to create numbers is the team who knows how to score goals! Find the 2v1s!</p>
<p>• Transition Defense: Its on you to decide when to stop ball, when to scrape, and when to rotate. Transition defense will make or break you!</p>
<p>• Settled Offense: There are times to push transition and there are times to settle the ball down. Do you know the difference? Championship teams do...</p>
<p>• Settled Defense: How far do you want to close out to play the ball? Are you going to pack it in and play zone? Slide from the crease or adjacent? Want to lock off their two best players? If you can't play defense, you are going to be in a world of hurt...</p>

Brain Teasers/ Mechanical puzzles ?

Our journey started when we were looking for a smarter game, a game that would force us to think outside the box both mentally and physically. We were looking for mind games and puzzles that incorporated today's advanced technology and will be extremely difficult to solve.. That’s what Lock Sphere is, A Game with no obvious solution !
The goal is very simple. the process ... 
You will get your EX1 Sphere locked & ready for action. Using symbols marked on the sphere - you will need to preform various actions in order to find the correct conditions that will lead to the end solution.. only then the Sphere will split open to reveal a special show.
The Solution ?!


Solving the Sphere could take you miles away...  this is not easy.
The process in reaching the goal could include everything you can imagine...  The Sphere will walk you outside to the open fields, day or night. You may need to move it to a specific place, specific conditions, move it in certain angles... wait a certain amount of time or any other variety of factors you can only imagine. You only have the symbols marked on the Sphere and your imagination & creativity. 
You will have to think outside of the box for this one.

Hello everyone, my name is David,i am 26 years old  and i am a designer.

Few months ago i went to a trek in Bolivia with two friends.
During the trek we got lost in a blizzard, and after the wind took our map, we decided that we will go to sleep and in the morning we will start again our way back to city.
We opened our tent for the night and started to gather all our emergency survival gear, but due to the weather, it was very hard for us to find our tools that were spread in all of our bags. Because of that, it was a horrible life threatening night.
After this experience,  i knew i have to design a storage box that will enable you to gather up all of your survival gear and storage them in one box, and that you can easily take it with you for all kind of outdoor activities. I also knew, that this storage box can't be just an ordinary boring box, but it needs to be really unique and special.  Therefor, i created the ultimate design: ""Zombie Survival Kit"" , cause what is more awesome then Zombies ??

What We Need & What You Get
So first i need to create a line of this product, that can serve you in many different ways, for example: storage your outdoor gear and easily carry it with you,  storage any item in your house as cloth,books and etc. 

Also this storage box can help you easily carry multiple items at once.So i checked the price of the machine that can create this box, and the price is 1000$, so this is the amount i need to raise in order to get start with our project. 
My dream= your comfort and fun!so just choose a Perks and help us with our project.

<p>Un juego sencillo de jugar pero dificil de dominar, y por fin ha llegado el momento.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our main goal with this campaign is to produce the starter game plus 4 miniatures that will increase the list of 8 <br/>characters that have already been produced reaching a total of 12 miniatures to choose from in order to create your teams.</h3>
<h3>If we get enough support this project will be made into reality and begin a whole new era.</h3>
<h3>Your help is essential. Thanks to your contributions we will not only acheive the necessary capital for producing the game <br/>but also the strength that gives us that support for what one intends to do.</h3>
<p>Nuestro principal objetivo con esta campaña es sacar adelante el starter del juego además de 4 miniaturas que pasarán a engrosar la lista de los 8 personajes que ya tenemos producidos pasando a tener así un total de 12 miniaturas entre las que poder elegir para poder crear vuestros equipos.<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span></p>

SOBRE NOSOTROS 
For five years Resina Planet (http://resinaplanet.com) has been making metal 30mm miniatures and the highest quality 6, 15 and 30mm scale resin scenery.
After a lot of effort we are ready to carry forward the miniature game based on Euphoria Miniatures (http://euphoriaminiatures.com), our futuristic miniature range.
A simple game to play but difficult to master, and finally the moment has come.
Desde Resina Planet (http://resinaplanet.com) llevamos más de 5 años en el sector del modelimo produciendo miniaturas en 30 mm de metal y escenografía en 6,15 y 30 mm de resina de la más alta calidad.
Después de mucho esfuerzo estamos preparados para sacar adelante el juego de miniaturas basado en nuestra gama futurista, EUPHORIA MINIATURES (http://euphoriaminiatures.com)
Un juego sencillo de jugar pero dificil de dominar, y por fin ha llegado el momento.
 
Our main goal with this campaign is to produce the starter game plus 4 miniatures that will increase the list of 8 characters that have already been produced reaching a total of 12 miniatures to choose from in order to create your teams.
If we get enough support this project will be made into reality and begin a whole new era.
Your help is essential. Thanks to your contributions we will not only acheive the necessary capital for producing the game but also the strength that gives us that support for what one intends to do.
Nuestro principal objetivo con esta campaña es sacar adelante el starter del juego además de 4 miniaturas que pasarán a engrosar la lista de los 8 personajes que ya tenemos producidos pasando a tener así un total de 12 miniaturas entre las que poder elegir para poder crear vuestros equipos. 
Si conseguimos el apoyo necesario este proyecto se convertirá en una realidad y comenzaremos lo que será una nueva era.

<h2><img alt=""About Outer Space Exiles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://outerspaceexiles.com/images/igg%20campaign/tank.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""About Outer Space Exiles""/></h2>
<p>Outer Space Exiles is one of a kind hybrid game. It’s inspired by titles like Total Annihilation, Dungeon Keeper and various tycoon and business simulations, the best pieces of which we decided to put together for a brand new experience. Generally one can say it’s RTS with RPG and tycoon elements, but in fact it goes way deeper than that and there are fundamental differences between it and typical RTS, RPG and tycoon games.</p>
<p><img alt=""The art of Outer Space Exiles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://outerspaceexiles.com/images/igg%20campaign/art1.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The art of Outer Space Exiles""/></p>
<p>The game will take you in outer space where anything can happen and you need to keep your eyes peeled. Player takes the role of a colony manager who needs to make sure their colony functions well and provides good standard to colonists. Basically they can hire workers, convicts, military personnel and scouts to work and live there. However here comes the big difference between Outer Space Exiles and other games. Player needs to treasure their colonists as they are all unique. Each colonists has their own <strong>IDENTITY</strong> and <strong>PERSONALITY</strong> that determine their behavior, actions and decisions. That’s why, in this game NPC’s are no longer cannon fodder, they can choose their own path and destiny. You cannot influence them directly (i.e. selecting them all and clicking on a random spot of the map to move them there), but instead you will need to be very creative how to <strong>MOTIVATE</strong> them to perform specific tasks and jobs. Having different identities, different motivation models will work for different colonists. Some will choose money, other will do it for the community, some will do it out of heroism. And as they develop over time, player needs to take good care of them, keeping their <strong>LOYALTY</strong> high and supplying them with new gear because of two reasons: they won’t want their well developed colonists to be killed because of poor equipment and they won’t want them to take the next transport out of that lousy colony and move to a new one. So the task of the colony manager is not going to be an easy one. They will need to build various factories, shops and research labs where colonists can research new blueprints for improved weaponry, defense systems, vehicles and whatnot.</p>
<h3>We started working on Outer Space Exiles in January and we have almost finished our work on the game prototype and will be able to release it this fall. Our goal is to build up a community and release our first alpha by the end of the year. And now we need your help to make this dream come alive!</h3>

<h2><img alt=""The story of Outer Space Exiles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://outerspaceexiles.com/images/igg%20campaign/drifter.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The story of Outer Space Exiles""/></h2>
<p>Outer Space Exiles features a unique plot, written by an <strong>award-winning author</strong>. Player immerses into a future world in which Earth and Human race are at the edge of collapse. Planetary resources are almost depleted, humans need to find a new home pronto. While preparations for the great conquering of space take place for few decades, it's decided to scrap Earth's most unwelcome residents - criminals, convicts, chronically sick, unemployed, uneducated, poorly skilled...</p>
<h2><img alt=""The art of Outer Space Exiles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://outerspaceexiles.com/images/igg%20campaign/art2.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The art of Outer Space Exiles""/></h2>
<p>All the marginals were no longer treated as equally right and were soon sent to outer space looking for their luck or in most cases, death. Meanwhile massive inbreeding took place on Earth for 50 years. And there it is, the shiny new generation of new hopes that is believed to save humanity.</p>
<p>And the day came for them to reach for the stars, looking for a new place to reform the Human race.</p>
<p>But what was everyone's surprise when they found long ago exiled marginals not only survived, but grew stronger and are now about to unleash a long awaited payback. To you, the players, this is certainly good news. Because unlike other games in Outer Space Exiles you will join the <strong>""BAD GUYS""</strong> and deal some justice for what your people had to suffer and go through during these 50 years.</p>

<h3><img alt=""The concept of Outer Space Exiles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://outerspaceexiles.com/images/igg%20campaign/fatso.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The concept of Outer Space Exiles""/></h3>
<p>Outer Space Exiles combines elements from different genres and fuses them in an unique way.</p>
<p>One can look at it as a Real-Time Strategy, but it's far from the truth. Our major concern with these games is vast majority of them involves mindless production of cannon fodder and it's the quantity, not the strategy that determines mission outcome.</p>
<p>Well, we never liked that and decided to turn it upside down.</p>
<p>So instead of mass producing and not caring about mass losses, we would like the player to treasure their units. And the units on the other hand respond accordingly. The more you take care of them, the more they tend to develop and become of higher value to your game.</p>
<p>Add the idea that, each and every NPC has their own personality and mindset it will act according to and you end up with the equation that no two NPC's ever share the same personality that makes for a completely different game every time with endless replay possibilities.</p>
<p><img alt=""The art of Outer Space Exiles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://outerspaceexiles.com/images/igg%20campaign/art3.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The art of Outer Space Exiles""/></p>
<p>The colony itself has a limited capacity and infrastructure and although transport ships regularly come and go bringing new goods and eventually colonists, there will never be abundance of resources and workforce. This is outer space and player needs to make do with what they have at hand. Knowing that colonists can also decide to leave the colony, you can easily understand that this experience will be nothing like walk in the park.</p>
<p>And here we come to the enemy. Of course there are enemies. Your major enemy is the inbred generation and Global Government. And you are going to give them mama's boys hell for the 50 years you spent in exile. But don't get comfortable after pushing them back to where they came from. You might soon end up fighting on two or more fronts with enemies you never thought existed.</p>
<h3><img alt=""The gameplay of Outer Space Exiles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://outerspaceexiles.com/images/igg%20campaign/troops.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The gameplay of Outer Space Exiles""/></h3>
<p>Player assumes the role of a colony manager. They come to a freshly inhabited colony where they place their shops. Generally there are 4 types of shops that produce medical supplies, weapons, vehicles and protective equipment.</p>
<p>Medical supplies feature field medikits, boosters and drugs to enhance colonists durability. Weapons shop produce a vast array of weapons. Vehicle shop brings the next combat level to your colony by adding quads, tanks and other heavy machinery. Protective equipment deals with armors, suits and barriers to make your colonists less vulnerable.</p>
<p>The player starts with a choice of two shops.</p>
<h2><img alt=""The art of Outer Space Exiles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://outerspaceexiles.com/images/igg%20campaign/art4.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The art of Outer Space Exiles""/></h2>
<p>One of the main differences with other RTS games is in Outer Space Exiles you <strong>CAN'T</strong> control the colonists directly. They do things as they please and see fit at the moment. However you can <strong>INFLUENCE</strong> their decisions by adding bounties and increase their loyalty offering them better equipment.</p>
<p>The RPG element comes from them developing with each and every new challenge and enemy they encounter. And the tycoon element comes from you not only dealing with the shops, but also trying to anticipate and satisfy demands for technologies and equipment by constantly researching blueprints and producing new items.</p>
<p>Of course there are also resources involved with that and that's how it all ties up together - if your colonists don't mine resources for you because they don't feel the urge to do it, you will end up buying resources off remote black markets. That means there will be delays in production while resources arrive and production costs will skyrocket. So it's all about finding the perfect balance.</p>
<p>The Multiplayer mode on the other hand provides a whole new dimension for your gameplay as it lets you interact with other players within your solo campaign. Once you join a Colonial Trade Chamber you end up among buddies you can rely on.</p>
<p>But be aware that CTC membership also requires you to give. It's a two-way relation. Colonial Trade Chambers have contracts with Global Government.</p>
<p><img alt=""The art of Outer Space Exiles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://outerspaceexiles.com/images/igg%20campaign/art5.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The art of Outer Space Exiles""/></p>
<p>They need to provide specific amounts of ores and technologies each month. In exchange, Global Government will provide them with books and blueprints CTC members can freely grab and use. Failing to fulfill your quota however will have consequences and Global Government will send some forces to put some sense in you and get you back on track.</p>

<p></p></span></div>","Ok, ladies and gentlemen, this is our final week. And while we believe in miracles, a tiny bit of skepticism crawls through our minds when we think about the possibility of reaching any of our goals. Still, helping us spread the word about Outer Space Exiles is something you can do if you can't afford to back us up right now. Thank you for for bearing with us. You are stars!

Outer Space Exiles is one of a kind hybrid game. It’s inspired by titles like Total Annihilation, Dungeon Keeper and various tycoon and business simulations, the best pieces of which we decided to put together for a brand new experience. Generally one can say it’s RTS with RPG and tycoon elements, but in fact it goes way deeper than that and there are fundamental differences between it and typical RTS, RPG and tycoon games.

The game will take you in outer space where anything can happen and you need to keep your eyes peeled. Player takes the role of a colony manager who needs to make sure their colony functions well and provides good standard to colonists. Basically they can hire workers, convicts, military personnel and scouts to work and live there. However here comes the big difference between Outer Space Exiles and other games. Player needs to treasure their colonists as they are all unique. Each colonists has their own IDENTITY and PERSONALITY that determine their behavior, actions and decisions. That’s why, in this game NPC’s are no longer cannon fodder, they can choose their own path and destiny. You cannot influence them directly (i.e. selecting them all and clicking on a random spot of the map to move them there), but instead you will need to be very creative how to MOTIVATE them to perform specific tasks and jobs. Having different identities, different motivation models will work for different colonists. Some will choose money, other will do it for the community, some will do it out of heroism. And as they develop over time, player needs to take good care of them, keeping their LOYALTY high and supplying them with new gear because of two reasons: they won’t want their well developed colonists to be killed because of poor equipment and they won’t want them to take the next transport out of that lousy colony and move to a new one. So the task of the colony manager is not going to be an easy one. They will need to build various factories, shops and research labs where colonists can research new blueprints for improved weaponry, defense systems, vehicles and whatnot.
We started working on Outer Space Exiles in January and we have almost finished our work on the game prototype and will be able to release it this fall. Our goal is to build up a community and release our first alpha by the end of the year. And now we need your help to make this dream come alive!




Outer Space Exiles features a unique plot, written by an award-winning author. Player immerses into a future world in which Earth and Human race are at the edge of collapse. Planetary resources are almost depleted, humans need to find a new home pronto. While preparations for the great conquering of space take place for few decades, it's decided to scrap Earth's most unwelcome residents - criminals, convicts, chronically sick, unemployed, uneducated, poorly skilled...

All the marginals were no longer treated as equally right and were soon sent to outer space looking for their luck or in most cases, death. Meanwhile massive inbreeding took place on Earth for 50 years. And there it is, the shiny new generation of new hopes that is believed to save humanity.
And the day came for them to reach for the stars, looking for a new place to reform the Human race.
But what was everyone's surprise when they found long ago exiled marginals not only survived, but grew stronger and are now about to unleash a long awaited payback. To you, the players, this is certainly good news. Because unlike other games in Outer Space Exiles you will join the ""BAD GUYS"" and deal some justice for what your people had to suffer and go through during these 50 years.
Be sure to read the complete back story on our blog.

Outer Space Exiles combines elements from different genres and fuses them in an unique way.
One can look at it as a Real-Time Strategy, but it's far from the truth. Our major concern with these games is vast majority of them involves mindless production of cannon fodder and it's the quantity, not the strategy that determines mission outcome.
Well, we never liked that and decided to turn it upside down.
So instead of mass producing and not caring about mass losses, we would like the player to treasure their units. And the units on the other hand respond accordingly. The more you take care of them, the more they tend to develop and become of higher value to your game.
Add the idea that, each and every NPC has their own personality and mindset it will act according to and you end up with the equation that no two NPC's ever share the same personality that makes for a completely different game every time with endless replay possibilities.

The colony itself has a limited capacity and infrastructure and although transport ships regularly come and go bringing new goods and eventually colonists, there will never be abundance of resources and workforce. This is outer space and player needs to make do with what they have at hand. Knowing that colonists can also decide to leave the colony, you can easily understand that this experience will be nothing like walk in the park.
And here we come to the enemy. Of course there are enemies. Your major enemy is the inbred generation and Global Government. And you are going to give them mama's boys hell for the 50 years you spent in exile. But don't get comfortable after pushing them back to where they came from. You might soon end up fighting on two or more fronts with enemies you never thought existed.

Player assumes the role of a colony manager. They come to a freshly inhabited colony where they place their shops. Generally there are 4 types of shops that produce medical supplies, weapons, vehicles and protective equipment.
Medical supplies feature field medikits, boosters and drugs to enhance colonists durability. Weapons shop produce a vast array of weapons. Vehicle shop brings the next combat level to your colony by adding quads, tanks and other heavy machinery. Protective equipment deals with armors, suits and barriers to make your colonists less vulnerable.
The player starts with a choice of two shops.

One of the main differences with other RTS games is in Outer Space Exiles you CAN'T control the colonists directly. They do things as they please and see fit at the moment. However you can INFLUENCE their decisions by adding bounties and increase their loyalty offering them better equipment.
The RPG element comes from them developing with each and every new challenge and enemy they encounter. And the tycoon element comes from you not only dealing with the shops, but also trying to anticipate and satisfy demands for technologies and equipment by constantly researching blueprints and producing new items.
Of course there are also resources involved with that and that's how it all ties up together - if your colonists don't mine resources for you because they don't feel the urge to do it, you will end up buying resources off remote black markets. That means there will be delays in production while resources arrive and production costs will skyrocket. So it's all about finding the perfect balance.
The Multiplayer mode on the other hand provides a whole new dimension for your gameplay as it lets you interact with other players within your solo campaign. Once you join a Colonial Trade Chamber you end up among buddies you can rely on.
But be aware that CTC membership also requires you to give. It's a two-way relation. Colonial Trade Chambers have contracts with Global Government.

They need to provide specific amounts of ores and technologies each month. In exchange, Global Government will provide them with books and blueprints CTC members can freely grab and use. Failing to fulfill your quota however will have consequences and Global Government will send some forces to put some sense in you and get you back on track.
There is a fearsome competition between CTC's as the more successful ones have access to much better items.
Our goal is to create a working prototype by the end of the year, including things like professional made music, sound effects and a game server, where we can test the multiplayer part on.
Here is a breakdown of what we will use the campaign money on:

hire a sound engineer for the sound effects
and a band for the soundtrack
work on the Mac and Linux versions of the game
rent game servers for our multiplayer part
buy licenses for professional game developer software
spend more time on awesome game features which we would like to develop

We hope to raise enough money with our campaign, so we can launch a alpha / beta in spring 2014, that has all the features, including graphics and music, ready.



Please mind the following table in order to easily understand our tiers and what rewards are included in each of them.

Crooked Rocket Studios is a two-man venture. One is taking care of coding and all that backend jazz, while the other is after the visuals and writing. Both of us have many years of experience both as gamers and professionals in our own areas which we decided to finally put together and make a dream come true.
