We are confident we have a stable platform and are leveraging well-tested source code but the environmental variables of the real world do present some unknowns. This is why we have a BETA testing batch of clocks going out 3 months prior to the bulk release to ensure that our source code is bullet-proof prior to release.The source code is perfectly functional as-is and could be released today; however, we have a desire for some polishing and a few further enhancements. The source is stable and we are excited to release it and have those interested and able continue to improve it.All our production hurdles have been crossed. Suppliers have been identified and samples purchased to ensure compatibility and quality. We are past prototyping and ready for production.We have full control over the production process which allows us to identify any problems early on and make quality and efficiency improvements along the way. We are utilizing time-tested techniques in the manufacturing process to ensure consistent, quality results.",8.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Craig DeVine, and I teach engineering courses at a local high school. I teach the senior capstone course called Engineering Design and Development (EDD), where students research and develop ideas that help make the world a better place.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding received will allow two EDD students at the high school to design, prototype and test Stove Safe during their senior year.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of Stove Safe could potentially be enormous. People across all markets agree that living independently as one ages is important and both younger and senior people are relatively satisfied with products that promote feelings of safety in their home environment. Keeping seniors safely at home longer also reduces medical costs in avoiding pricey and sometimes preventable nursing home admissions and hospitalizations. The average cost for nursing home care in the U.S. is $6,700 a month, so even a modest delay could add up fast. Keeping seniors at home could save billions of dollars a year in medical costs. Functional decline is the main reason elderly people end up in nursing homes. Additionally, researchers at the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation found keeping seniors at home also makes for more stable communities.  The NGO also found home modifications helped an elderly person live at home for 13 months longer than expected.

<p>The name “ZIN” is a blend of the Z class and IN class Nixie lamps. It took us profound research and hard work to transform the two classes into one. Conceptually, first we modernized a beautiful base which is used in the Z class tubes. Then, we elongated a small IN18 Nixie tube with digits measuring 44 mm in height., and mounted it in the base. We strengthened the entire piece to create the modern adaptation of the Reborn ZIN18 super-compact Nixie tube  using modern equipment. Most of the Nixie tubes that are used in technical projects are taken from the 50-year-old storages. We offer a modern Nixie tube which can be used in a wide variety of different projects, providing a modern more widely available alternative to the older original Nixie tube components which are becoming harder and harder to find. </p>

<p>The Manufacturing Process<br/> The manufacturing of this beautiful tube is like creating an art piece like mechanical clocks, perfume, or gem jewelry. The process is quite intricate and mesmerizing with all of its milestones elaborated. First, we manually assemble 47 best quality components of the envelope. Then, we form the glass tube and the thread in special machines, and put the whole piece in the “ovens” with temperatures as high as 1,000 degrees °C. Then, we anneal it, infuse mixture of pure gasses, and finally test it on the stand. Such procession results in highly strengthened glass of the tube and leak-free seal at the bottom part of the tube. And those are the two main checkpoints of the tube’s long service lifetime. The service life of a Reborn ZIN18 Nixie tube is about 20 years or 200,000 hours of uninterrupted work 24/7. Owing to such manufacturing process and scientific approach, the tubes components can be only worn out due to the aging of its materials. </p>

We made everything necessary for calculation, organization, and scheduling of the funds, time, and resources for production and delivery of items. So, you are most likely to get them early this spring. We can’t control when Kickstarter transfers us the money, and when the delivery companies deliver you the items.
If there is a delay caused by one of the two things mentioned above or by any other third party, we will keep you informed in the Updates section. This section will also contain manufacturing and delivery progress. We will make sure everything goes as smooth as possible when you order your super-compact Nixie tubes or your beautiful ZIN18 Nixie clock.If there is a delay with any of this chain pillars, ours or of the third party, we are going to keep you informed and make a note in the Updates section. This section will also contain all the progress that we will be making while manufacturing and sending you your items.

Bloomengine is perfect for the plant-lover looking to experience a seed sprout, bud, and bloom in the convenience of their own home.  
       You can easily customize environmental conditions for your plants via the Bloomengine application available for Android and iOS devices. Watering and lighting times can be scheduled and even time-lapse settings can be set according to you or your plant's preferences. <Controlled Habitat For Delicate Plant> Bloomengine’s water tank can store up to 40oz of water so that you do not have to worry about re-filling it for anywhere during 1 month. The internal water pump which keeps the water circulating ensures that the water inside the tank always stays fresh.<A pump in the upper & lower tank circulates the water.>  Watering the plant in Bloomengine can be done without going through the process of opening and closing the water tank or lid. You can pour the water right over the top and simply enjoy the sight of water flowing down. The compressed soil we provide can be stored for an extended period of time when stored in a dry area before its use. To plant the seed, simply soak the compressed soil with water and place the seed on top of it. The soil is easy to replace even when you need to re-pot a plant and naturally decomposes to ease your burden.  LED lighting chips are installed underneath the top portion of the device and provides an adequate amount of light necessary for plants to grow indoors. The lighting chips also emit a warm light to provide an elegant atmosphere for any interior.We have applied enough brightness (about 10~25k lux) and light wavelength (about 380nm~780nm) of LED lighting to Bloomengine shown so you can easily grow plants indoors.The elegant RGB light will change colors (it doesn't affect the plants) to match the atmosphere of the room. You can control the color of light through the Bloomengine smartphone app.  A fan installed in Bloomengine for the ventilation of fresh air. This accelerates the plant growth by supporting the plant’s transpiration process. You will be able to see the leaves waving by the wind created by the fan.<The micro-fan inside circulates the air.><Plants dance with wind> The integrated Full HD camera shows your plant's real-time status by capturing a photo. You can select the time-lapse function to record the unbelievable moments of your plant growing during each stage. <Timelapse example of a daisy growing>    ※ Depending on the seed germination rate and indoor environmental conditions, using Bloomengine may not bud.(Typical seed germination rate about 70 ~ 90%, recommended room temperature 74 ~ 83 ℉ / 22 ~ 28 ℃)  

 




*Selected one of '5 most innovative products - Consumer Electronics show'


 
     Participated Exhibition in 2017-2018 Bloomengine aims to provide an environment of indoor cultivation for plants using the latest technology. Why?Save Plants From ExtinctionAcross the planet, plants are threatened with extinction and are expected to disappear within several years. Beautiful flowers you see now could be considered historic species for future generations.To prevent further plant extinction, Bloomengine will continue to develop newer products and share data on plants to safely and effectively cultivate an environment that can save plants from extinction.  Plant Book and DictionaryToday, we can gather facts about plants from only photos and vague data. It is difficult to understand information about plants or to experience a wonderful moment like a flower's first bloom with such non-descriptive information.Our plan is for Bloomengine users to share growth information with each other like sprouting times, growth progress, and first blooms with the best environmental condition and time-lapse videos, so people can easily understand the plant's lifecycle. This would be shared in our community or on Wikipedia as text data or GIF files. Share The MomentOur goal is not only to make better conditions for your plant indoors but also to help build bonds between people and plants.We believe that Bloomengine will help everyone understand plants better and share the amazing moments of plants with others. For A Better PlaceWe want to create better interior spaces through Bloomengine.Bloomengine's design goals are (1) Making it easy to grow plants indoors. (2) It does not make the product stand out, but instead, makes the plant stand out. (3) It uses a simple design that will suit various indoor spaces.You can make your interior space more special with Bloomengine. Always be with your pet-plants in your own home.    CUSTOMS & DUTIES INFORMATIONOur prices do not include VAT, GST or other country taxes.

</div></div>","WHAT ARE MICROSCAPE MODELS?
Microscape architectural models celebrate the sculptural beauty of cities in durable panels that make incredibly distinctive gifts, decorative accents for home or office, and mementos of the most important moments -- and places -- in our lives.
 
 
They're 3D-printed from our own accurate, up-to-date aerial scan data, meaning that they can evolve along with the built environment. Because we manually process all of that data to make it printable, they can also include buildings still under construction or still in planning.We intend to cover major cities across the US and around the world, but our initial proving ground has been the city of New York. (We figure if we can make models of here, we can make models of anywhere...) 

 

 YOU CAN OWN THIS TOWN
Our flagship Manhattan Collection is a set of over 200 modular panels that - alone or grouped together - can serve as a beautifully sculptural decorative accent or full-wall treatment, an incredibly unique gift commemorating special events and places, or a functional, fully accurate context model in which to test architectural and urban design concepts. 

 
Designed by architects for architects - and everyone else - the Microscape Manhattan Collection is an elegantly understated way for anyone who has ever visited, lived in or been inspired by the city of New York to show their appreciation for one of the world’s greatest metropolitan centers. 
 
 

MICROSCAPE HISTORY
We introduced Microscape models to the world with a successful crowdfunding campaign in February, raising over 1000 percent of our goal. 

We’ve already begun delivering models to our original backers and opened up pre-orders via the Microscape website. When we received an invitation to tell the IndieGoGo community about what we’re doing through the InDemand program, we thought it would be a great way to reach even more people. 
 
 


SOME OF THE PERKS
Individual Microscape models will be sold at a retail price of $125. By placing a pre-order now, you can reserve one or more of the over 200 panels in the Manhattan Collection for only $95. 
Below are some of the most sought after models in the collection - the links below each picture lead to additional images and information: 
 
 

03-B | The World Trade Center  
 09-E | The Empire State Building  09-F | The Chrysler Building  10-E | Times Square  09-D | Madison Square Garden 
 10-F | St. Patrick's Cathedral & Park Avenue
 
11-E | Carnegie Hall
 
11-F | The Plaza Hotel
...and some suggested combinations of panels: 

06-C | NYU West and 06-D | NYU East 

07-D | Union Square Park and 07-E | Gramercy Park and 08-D | The Flatiron Building and 08-E Madison Square Park

I wanted to create a space that inspires and enables others to find and be their own best self, to feel empowered through love and positivity and liberated from the fears and doubts that hold them back. I began growing my brand and online presence, sharing my inspiration, practices and resources, but I wanted to connect deeper.
A major game changer for me was Danielle LaPorte's Desire Map.


It gave me the push to do the work and really figure out what it was that I wanted, based on the simple principle of asking myself ""How do I want to feel?"" and the permission to live my life in the direction of those feelings. 
I have been sharing her work for years, and finally decided that this was the year to get a Desire Map Licence and to create workshops to help others navigate their way to living a life that feels good. 
These workshops would offer participants the opportunity to be guided through the key steps of the Desire Map and getting clear on how they want to feel.I will also be incorporating other aspects of my persona practices, with group meditations, aromatheraphy, healthy recipes and more. 

With my move to Australia taking up most of my time and resources, the plan was to get settled, back on our feet and then invest in the Licence Program in March, but circumstance has intervened.The registration to get my Licence for this year closes January 31st, and so to fulfil my dream and vision for 2016, I need your help!

A NEW, CLEAN & RENEWABLE SOURCE OF POWER FOR THE WORLD'S ENVIRONMENTAL & ENERGY FUTURE
 
 
Our poles are melting, our ocans are rising, our climate is changing, plants and animals are in decline. Our environment is in distress.
 
(NASA Study)
 
We propose that we have an energy solution that replaces fossil fuels with affordable clean energy which curbs toxic and greenhouse gas emissions in the next 2-5 years.  
 
Would you help support our efforts to implementation this clean energy technology solution into society?  Here is why we are asking for your help:  A Plan to Save Our Environment       
 
 
Marine Power Products (MPP), a self funded research/developer of clean and renewable energy conversion technology based on Active Ion Displacement (or AID).  
AID is the science of converting hot water to hydrogen fuel.  AID allows for the conversion of low cost energy from hot water into high grade hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gases.  Low grade heat can be found everywhere and hydrogen can be used as a fuel to power our cars, generate our electricity, reduce pollutants at fossil fired power plants and produce compounds that society uses every day.
 
Currently produced hydrogen comes from processes (like natural gas and electricity) ultimately produce significant amounts of carbon dioxide which are greenhouse gases that impact our environment.  
 
AID is different.  AID uses low temperature heat sources as energy instead of natural gas and electricity.  This difference is what makes AID so special and ultimately vitally important to our worlds energy security.
 
When combined with heat sources such as a geothermal wells,  solar heat, industrial process that emit heat, or the heat from combustion, AID allows society to produce clean and renewable energy for clean living, minimizing impact on all of our health and the environment.  
 
What Has Been Completed to Date
For over 8 years, many lab scale experiments have been conducted and several prototypes have been built and tested.  In early 2011 the US Air Force, Sandia National Labs and the DOE conducted an Assessment of the potential for the AID science and technology.   Five patents have been filed so far (spanning 12 potential future patents) and we are currently working on 5 follow-on improvement patents.  A team of 30 scientists, engineers and technical experts have developed the AID science and technology over time and now are ready to build a commercial pilot plant.
 
 
Our Next Steps
Our goal is to build and demonstrate the AID technology's capability at the industrial scale. We are staging our progress funding $250K into 3 separate phases: 

Phase 1, $90K, Purchase Components and Equipment - Secure all equipment necessary for the build-out.
Phase 2, $90K,  Product Assembly - Assemble the Pilot plant. 
Phase 3, $70K,  Testing and Demonstration - Develop, adjust, tweak, and stabilize the hydrogen production pilot plant.
In the current Phase, Phase 1, we are raising money to purchase components, parts, equipment and the overhead to support the  pilot plant. 
 
Engineering designs and build-up plans for the industrial scale pilot plant have already just recently been completed.  The pilot will be installed at a low grade and currently unused geothermal site.  It is anticipated to initially produce between 5 kWt and 10 kWt of thermal energy in hydrogen. We believe AID will prove out within 120 days from receipt of full project funding. The pilot will be a working model for demonstrating the significance and importance of heat conversion to hydrogen energy to many various industries, an important beginning.  
 
The Risks
There are risks with our project.  Our previous models have established that the process does in fact work.  The science has been reviewed by the scientific and engineering communities.  The actual process is however, inherently unstable and requires computer process control. There are process control and software adjustments that we need to make as we scale the equipment up.  
 
We have world class engineers and scientists assisting us to do that.  We anticipate the system will break 100 times and be fixed  the same amount.  With persistence, it will develop into a smooth running industrial scale pilot plant.
 
Even if our project is only partially funded, we will still continue to apply resources to the development of the technology, and continue seeking funding for the balance needed. 
 
In Closing
Our perks are items you can use daily.  These items have been selected to provide you with a reminder of your contribution toward the development of potentially important technology, a technology that just may make our world a better place to live. We have intentionally been conservative with the cost of these perks to create the best opportunity for our success.  
 
If making a contribution is a challenge at this time, please help by spreading the word about AID by sharing this link with your friends and family through email, facebook and other social media.
 
We are working hard for a cleaner and more sustainable world for all of us. 
 
Thank you for your support!

<p>This Indiegogo has been set up to give our family and friends the opportunity to give presents for our wedding. Here's how we met...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Chris's Story - </strong>I met Rita at a friend's pic-nic in Knightsbridge in London in April 2011. She lived in Bristol but I couldn't bear our time apart so she moved in to my shared house in August. I didn't for a moment doubt inviting her to live with me and I knew I couldn't let her get away. I proposed in Rome in November. I carried a ring around Rome to all those stunningly romantic places everyone tells you about but it was back at our quiet hotel room, with a pic-nic of local foods on the bed and glasses of Prosecco on the balcony over looking a beautiful park that I proposed. </p>
<p>It took us month's to find a home, but finally we moved in to our first place in February this year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rita's Story - </strong>I met Chris at a very good friend of mine, while my sister was with me on her summer vacations. The weather was perfect for an April picnic, we got on very well from the very beginning. Next day Chris invited me to his homemade Sunday Roast, and thats what stole my heart ;). Since then we've become almost unseparatable. i knew straight away he was very special: caring, loving, romantic, crazy....! It is a big blessing to share my life with my baby squirrel Chris.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Plan! - </strong>We were lucky to know some people moving away from England and were able to buy most of the things we needed for our flat from them in one go. So rather than add more glasses, toaster's and other stuff to our little home we thought we would instead ask you to help us buy a car for our little family. </p>
<p>As thanks for helping us raise money for our car we're using our contacts to give you something back too. We'll be producing a beautiful little book containing pictures and momentoes from our wedding day for you to remember as we will. We'll be sending this to everyone and will have a digital version for friends as well.   </p>
<p>We're not specifically trying to hit any target (Indiegogo requires you set an actual target) but will use whatever money raised to get the most reliable car that we can use to visit family and friends as well as get to work.If we go over the target all the money will go towards getting a more reliable car and contribute towards us having a nice honeymoon somewhere.</p>
<p>You'll see you have the opportunity to choose several PERKS which are basically fun gifts of different amounts we dreamed up to help you envision us building the car from all the gifts. All the money goes in to the same pot so don't worry what they're called!</p>
<p>Indiegogo only shows amounts in dollars, so if you're not sure exactly what the amounts are below just check <a href=""http://www.xe.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.xe.com</a> for the exchange rate. A good rule of thumb is 1.55 US$ = £1. </p>

But here is the logic behind the name: Our device operates in a wet environment, and it kills. It kills the things that cause infections in your bathroom. Hello!My name is Benjamin Sonovani.Like many of you, my family and I are in quarantine during this Corona virus pandemic. We can't go out. It's impossible to know who is infected and who could possibly transmit this disease to other people. It is more important than ever to be diligent about disinfecting our homes.                                                                 History of KILLER WHALE:A good friend of mine died tragically as a result of an infection.His death hit me hard.He is the one who inspired me to create the Killer Whale. My friend was a doctor, full of medical knowledge, and yet he still died because of an infection. Two years ago, grief-stricken, I decided to do something to prevent the next infection. Together with my partners, we founded Killer Whale, the toilet-cleaning device to support the disabled, the elderly, children and other people who have difficulties keeping their toilet as clean as it should be.                                                           Most of our self-invested money was spent on seeking a patent and building an effective prototype. Killer Whale requires no installation, no messing around and can help save people like my friend. I’m proud to say that Killer Whale was patented in December 2019.  How Killer Whale Works:Killer Whale is an autonomous device that operates 24/7.When idle, the system is turned off. When in use, a full disinfection of the toilet bowl and seat will be performed after each use.                   
The special cleansing formula is designed to eradicate most germs that thrive within the toilet compartment. Much like a computer printer, Killer Whale uses cleaning fluid cartridges. You’ll be asked to routinely replace the cartridges, usually once in a month, depending on the size of your family and the frequency of use of the toilet. The disinfection process of Killer Whale starts from the exterior of the toilet, including droplets in the air. With 99% of bacteria, viruses and germs killed, you'll know for sure that the health of your family is secure.Killer Whale sprays the toilet bowl with disinfection liquid and cleans the bowl, killing germs after you finish your business and before the next person steps in.This small, efficient device cleans and disinfects the toilet surface and its seat. Killer Whale lets you know when it's done by changing the color of the water inside the bowl.
So, we have a working prototype.A product that millions of people all over the globe who are in quarantine today could benefit from using, but we have no money to get it out onto the market.The current outbreak of coronavirus emphasizes the battle mankind is facing in our pursuit of a healthy life and environment. Making sure that we live in neat and clean surroundings is necessary.Can you help us?

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>What would you do if you lost everything only weeks before a new baby? Well that's exactly what happened to my best friend, Shaun Byrd. On Tuesday December 13th, 2011, Shaun's family lost everything from smoke damage when their apartment building had a huge fire right down the hall. All this happening only weeks before Christmas and even worse, Alyssa (his wife) is 9 months pregnant and due any day. It couldn't have happened at a worse time. He doesn't know what to do and that's why I'm starting this to help him and his family recover before the new baby is welcomed to the world.<br/></p>
</div><div><p><br/></p></div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are only asking for $3,000 to help him cover the moving costs (apartment costs, etc) and get some basic things for the new apartment like a bed and crib for the new baby on the way. He could use more than $3,000 to really get back on his feet, but we set the goal for the bare minimum of what's needed. Any extra funds will go towards replacing things like a couch, clothes and toys for the kids. We appreciate all the help!<br/></p>
<p>All moneys received will go straight to his PayPal account immediately to help him get established before the baby arrives. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help financially, the next best way to help is to share this page far and wide. They need our help now and the only way they'll get that help is if people know they need it.<br/></p>

<p><b>MACS Application #3:</b></p>
<p>Similar to car engines, some amount of the energy produced by a
plane’s engines must be used to keep those engines cool. In this case, the MACS
present a highly efficient solution to increase the fuel efficiency of planes
(and lower your ticket prices). Though we’re talking about a larger scale
engine in this case, the design of the MACS means it can essentially be stacked
to any size, making it extremely adaptable.</p>
<p>There’s another benefit on planes to consider. At 30,000 feet,
the air is much cooler than it is at ground level. Because heat conduction
depends on a temperature difference, the efficiency of the MACS is enhanced
because heat is being removed into a far cooler environment. Using the MACS, an
efficiency at least 4, possible even 5 times greater than conventional systems
could be achieved. </p>
<p class=""normal""><strong> ____________________________________________________________</strong></p>
<p>Across the board, we as a society currently invest a significant amount of energy to creating a cooling infrastructure (ever wondered why your iPhone/iPad/Android gets so hot?). Aggressive shrinking of circuit components has created a situation in which traditional cooling methods simply cannot perform efficiently due to the high density of heat-producing components. As such, cooling technology is in dire need of innovation to address these issues that only continue getting worse. We've developed a micro-scale cooler we call the Micro Air Cycle System (MACS) to help.</p>
<p>The MACS is a fascinating new mesoscopic-MEMS enabled compressor that promises to revolutionize the cooling industry. The potential for high efficiency operation of the MACS answers the problems faced by current cooling technology, which has not had a major breakthrough in years.  The core component of the technology is an electrostatically compressed vane that can be replicated and stacked to fit a variety of shapes and sizes. Essentially, we've developed something on the small scale which runs completely differently than anything out there. </p>
<p>Because it relies on a different method of heat transfer than traditional cooling methods, the MACS can vastly improve upon the current efficiencies. Theory suggests the MACS can be more than 4x better than any conventional system today! This amounts to a drastic reduction in energy consumption with no loss in cooling capacity! To put it in perspective, batteries in many devices (computers, cars, laptops) could easily last twice as long as they do now. </p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p class=""normal"">We're two former students from the University of Texas at Dallas who have been working on this since 2010. We dedicated years of our lives and thousands of hours to moving it from an idea to a prototype. The MACS is a lot more than just a project for us, it's a passion that we've stuck with over 6 continents, 4 degrees in Electrical Engineering, and an utterly ridiculous amount of Chipotle (with some Freebirds mixed in for good measure).</p>
<p class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>How far along is the MACS?</strong></p>
<p class=""normal"">In Summer 2012, a major milestone for the MACS was reached with the first successful measurement of the ability of a vane stack to measure cooling. We're super excited about the progress that can be made by improving the manufacturing process to create more uniform vanes and reduce errors throughout the process. While these vanes represent approximately 7% of the theoretical value, manufacturing improvements can increase this figure by at least an order of magnitude.</p>
<p class=""normal"">We feel that we can move the MACS towards market rapidly, as a number of small changes can create vast improvements in the efficiency of the MACS. By taking advantage of already existing manufacturing technology, we can quickly begin to manufacture full-sized vane stacks and test them for real world applications.</p>
<p align=""center"" class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>MACS Advantage</strong></p>
<p class=""normal"">Compared to more conventional cooling methods, the MACS is a better solution. Compared to a legacy HVAC system, the MACS can be several times more efficient due to the low amount of energy necessary to drive compression and the ability to recover a large amount of the energy used. Because air conditioning represents a significant portion of energy usage, this efficiency boost will lower energy costs and conserve scarce resources. In addition, the MACS is a clean system. While conventional cooling systems have relied on some form of refrigerant (i.e., Freon) for cooling, the MACS uses no chemicals. That means the MACS provides a double bonus for the environment!</p>
<p class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>What will the money be used for?</strong> </p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>1)      </strong><strong>Improved Drive Circuit<br/></strong><br/> An integral part of ensuring the high efficiency of the MACS is to develop a drive circuit that reuses as much of the input energy as possible. The vane stack functions as two sets of alternately charging and discharging capacitors. This means that a high percentage of the energy used for compression of one half of the vanes can be recycled to compress the other half of the vanes, minimizing the power usage.<strong><br/><br/></strong>During Fall 2013 and Spring 2014, we will be sponsoring a Senior Design team to redesign the drive circuit to meet our goals of at least 70% charge recovery. In order to allow them to follow the circuit through the entire development process, we will need funding to purchase PCBs, components, and casing.</p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>2)      </strong><strong>Vane Design Optimization</strong></p>
<p class=""normal"">While we have demonstrated that the MACS concept is valid, there are still a number of areas that can be explored to increase the amount of cooling generated by the MACS per compression cycle. For example, we know that vane spacing plays a significant role in the efficiency of the system, but also would like to know how shape and area can influence the movement of heat in the system. Adequate funding will allow us to hire the personnel necessary to fully explore the ideal vane geometry through modeling and testing. With this knowledge, we can tune the system design and operating conditions to achieve the highest efficiency.</p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>3)      </strong><strong>Improved Manufacturing Process<br/><br/></strong>Wondering why our photos look like a bunch of super-cool sets of crinkly copper sheets?

<p class=""normal"">Having access to these manufacturers is key for us to implement full scale versions of the MACS. The cost to acquire this equipment ourselves would be enormous.

 are open-hardware products, so you can wait our add-on or you can make your own wireless add-on, basing on our project.

Moreover, many venture capitals are still reluctant to invest in hardware startup, since hardware projects has bigger scalability 
issues, related to distribution, and big fixed costs related to production in big volume. For these reasons, we need your help to produce the first batch of our products: the raised money will be used for the 
purchase of PCBs, electronic components, for the adhesive material and for the construction of mechanical structure. The entire production flow will be made in Italy, assuring the best quality in all the phases 
of production. We hope to reach the goal in this campaign, demonstrating that the market is ready for this kind of devices. Last, a crowfunding campaign represents for us a good check, in order 
to understand the real interest around the world for our products and allowing us to construct a growing community around our project. The community is very importnat for us, because our products will be open hardware 
so that anyone can modify them, creating a customized version.<br/><br/></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">As with all crowdfunding campaigns there are risks and challenges. 
Delivering a tech product is not easy task and GKILO+CLOGK are a blend of several parts, requiring a good level of engineering and system integration, together with craft skill.
We think we have a solid project, we demonstrated it with our prototype. 
<br/>From a software standpoint we are developing the app to control our devices and every suggestion on new functionalities is appreciated. We want to reach everyone, so we are studying 
also the SDK for Windows Phone, not only for Android and iPhone, well known by our Software Wizard, Domenico Cosentino.
Our challenge will be  to successfully organize the supply line, from a good number of suppliers.
Finally we'll succeed in scaling the production up (after delivering to our backers) only if we'll be able to increase our team size.
<br/>
Known risks are:
<br/>
- Higher production prices due to few units sold, increasing the number of components we have to preorder, reducing our resources.
<br/>
- System integrations (especially software/electronics) might require more time than expected.<br/><br/></span></p>

GK Series is our first line of products. It is composed by GKILO, a wood-like kitchen scale, and CLOGK, a timer with touch interface.  GKILO
 is a dual clock and kitchen scale. Resting on one side, the LED numbers act as a scale, displaying  the weight of any objects placed on it. Flip the GKILO over, and the lights will display the current time. 
 Using simple hand motions, users can easily reset the scale or adjust the time. In stand-by mode the object can be used as paperweight or shelf.  CLOGK is a modern take on the everyday clock. 
 At rest, the CLOGK acts as an eye catching and modern  decorative piece or paperweight. When activated by touch, the wood-like CLOGK displays an analog clock or  cooking timer.  Each Thingk 
 product is developed to be Wireless ready, and in case of great success we are thinking to a stretch goal to supply the wireless module built-in in our products. Moreover, our objects are open-hardware products, 
 so you can wait our add-on or you can make your own wireless add-on, basing on our project. 
   









With this campaign, we would like to bring our first line of products, GK Series, to the next level: 
we are now in the prototype phase and we hope to switch from prototypes to products. Moreover, we want demonstrate that it's time for a new class of devices, 
born for the Internet of Things era.However, GK series is only the first step towards our dream: revolutionize everyday products, adding internet of things and natural User interfaces.  Combining these skills, Thingk enters in the next Era of med-tech objects, that will be smart, cool and thought for modern User Experience. We attended the first European Maker Faire in Rome, October 3-6, 2013. Moreover, we won Switch2Product competition 2013, entering in Polihub, startup incubator funded by Politecnico di Milano. 
Previous Polihub startups were Fabtotum and Ginko Umbrella that experienced successfull crowdfunding campaigns on Indiegogo.



Last, we attended Milan Design Week 2014, one of the most important event in the world dedicated to Design objects.

GKILO

GKILO is a dual clock and kitchen scale. Resting on one side, the LED numbers act as a scale, displaying 
the weight of any objects placed on it. Flip the GKILO over, and the lights will display the current time. Using simple hand motions, users can easily reset the scale or adjust the time. In stand-by mode the object can be used as paperweight or shelf. A wireless module will ensure the possibility of interact with other Thingk products (for example CLOGK) and with an app 
(for Android, iOS). Wireless add-on completes the functionality of our devices: through an app you will choose the food you are weighing, and automatically the app will propose the cooking time for that food and for that weight.
 The app will interact with CLOGK, setting the timer on the appropriate countdown. At the end of the countdown, CLOGK and GKILO will blink together and touching one of these devices, both of them will stop to blink. 
 Each Thingk product is developed to be Wireless ready, and in case of great success we are thinking to a stretch goal to supply the wireless module built-in in our products. Moreover, our objects are open-hardware products, 
 so you can wait our add-on or you can make your own wireless add-on, basing on our project.

 GKILO. A wireless module will ensure the possibility of interact with other Thingk products (for example GKILO) and 
 with an app (for Android, iOS). Wireless add-on completes the functionality of our devices: through an app (Android, iOS) you will choose the food you are weighing, and automatically the app will propose the cooking time 
 for that food and for that weight. The app will interact with CLOGK, setting the timer on the appropriate countdown. At the end of the countdown, CLOGK and GKILO will blink together and touching one of these devices, both 
 of them will stop to blink. Each Thingk product is developed to be Wireless ready, and in case of great success we are thinking to a stretch goal to supply the wireless module built-in in our products. Moreover, our objects 
 are open-hardware products, so you can wait our add-on or you can make your own wireless add-on, basing on our project.

Finishing

Thanks to the top quality material that we use for the final coating of our objects, produced by 3M (the worldwide leader in this market segment) we can offer 4 different finishing: fair wood, burnt wood, marble and aluminium.


PCB CoreGKILO and CLOGK are based on an electronic board, developed by our team of engineers and based on Arduino platform. We love Arduino and we strongly believe in Open Source Hardware, so we took the best from this platform (wide range of libraries, huge community for help and tips, programming easiness), adding to our board some characteristics specifically thought for Natural User interfaces. For example, PCB Core is able to manage several touch buttons, it has a precision ADC, with an integrated INA, for very small signal measurements, it has an inclinometer on board and it is ready for temperature measurements.  Main characteristicsDual LayerDimension: 95.8 x 41.8mm MicroController ATMEGA328P-AU, AVR 32K FLASH4 touch buttons management Inclinometer 18-bit delta-sigma ADC with integrated INATemperature sensorFTDI on board for easy programming and communication

The Perks

 






















__________________________________________________________________________Stretch goals_If we will reach the goal (50.000 USD), we will be able to start the production of our first 
 products, GKILO and CLOGK. _Starting from 100.000 USD goal, we will be able to offer a choice between two different wood 
 textures. _Starting from 150.000 USD, we will switch from a 3D-printed structure to an injection molded 
 structure. This will allow superior reliability to the objects, assuring high reliability to our objects._Starting from 200.000 USD goal, we will include in our devices also the wireless add-on. 
 Thanks to this, GKILO and CLOGK will talk each other and with an app (iOS and Android): you will choose the food you are weighing, and automatically the app will propose the cooking time for that food and for that weight. 
 The app will interact with CLOGK, setting the timer on the appropriate countdown. At the end of the countdown, CLOGK and GKILO will blink together and touching one of these devices, both of them will stop to 
 blink.Please help us to reach the higher goal and we will have a lot of surprises for you!






________________________________________________________________________Who we are









THINGK is an italian startup, with a development team composed by 5 guys with different skills: 
 Stefano Marangoni (32), Andrea Gallivanoni (35) and Giuseppe Valenti (32) are Electronic Engineers with passion for design, innovation and personal fabrication, Umberto Tolino (37) is a Designer with long experience 
 in Visual Communication and Industrial Design, Domenico Cosentino (38) is the Software wizard, with focus on web development and mobile-apps. The entire development team comes from University of Politecnico di Milano, one of the most renowned european universities in Engineering, Architecture and Industrial Design since 1863
 

Our collaboration started with the production and realization of a 
 clock to celebrate the new model of Adidas Profi. Designed by Pomo (designer), completely 
 developed (materials and technology) by Thingk, the  clock recalls a basketball game: dimensions of the clock are the same of a basketball shoebox, the clock is covered with a synthetic material emulating the wood of the parquet and the circular LEDs indicating the hour and minutes recalls the scoreboard.





The hardware was based on  Arduino platform, the PCBs was realized with Sparkle-PCB, the mechanical structure was realized 
 in plexiglass glued by hand,  the wood-like adhesive material is cutted with laser cutter. The clock was distributed in 50 Adidas Originals Stores in Italy. This project gave us the opportunity 
 to understand that the world of med-tech objects is out of date: user interfaces with too many buttons, poor materials and no attention to Design. Starting from this consideration, we developed our 
 vision. 

__________________________________________________________________________Our Manifesto
We are what we think.
We are tired of dumb objects, of inanimate pieces, of single-function products.
We believe in elegance and beauty.
We are the the ideas we share, not the ones we keep secret.
We want to interact intelligently with everything we have around us, because this is our way of life: fast, mobile, 
parallel.
We are extreme, but willing to listen.
We believe that job society is finished. We believe interaction society has started.
We are the evolution of the species. We are the new men with the club and our club is irony.
We are immersed in technology, but we are not slaves, we are interpreters.
We are the ones that when someone say ""Stop daydreaming"", answer ""You told me to stop breathing"".
We are proud of our past, but we believe, think and live in the future.
We are constantly changing, because the ability to adapt to our time is what characterizes us.
We are a mass, not an elite. It may not look like it, because we are widespread, not concentrated.
You have to observe from above to understand us.
We would like only one epitaph: ""They had every right to teach, because they spent all their time learning"".

__________________________________________________________________________Why a crowdfunding campaign
We are a little team with no established company behind with huge funds to invest. Moreover, many venture capitals are still reluctant to invest in hardware startup, since hardware projects has bigger scalability 
issues, related to distribution, and big fixed costs related to production in big volume. For these reasons, we need your help to produce the first batch of our products: the raised money will be used for the 
purchase of PCBs, electronic components, for the adhesive material and for the construction of mechanical structure. The entire production flow will be made in Italy, assuring the best quality in all the phases 
of production. We hope to reach the goal in this campaign, demonstrating that the market is ready for this kind of devices. Last, a crowfunding campaign represents for us a good check, in order 
to understand the real interest around the world for our products and allowing us to construct a growing community around our project. The community is very importnat for us, because our products will be open hardware 
so that anyone can modify them, creating a customized version.

__________________________________________________________________________Risk and challenge
As with all crowdfunding campaigns there are risks and challenges. 
Delivering a tech product is not easy task and GKILO+CLOGK are a blend of several parts, requiring a good level of engineering and system integration, together with craft skill.
We think we have a solid project, we demonstrated it with our prototype. 
From a software standpoint we are developing the app to control our devices and every suggestion on new functionalities is appreciated. We want to reach everyone, so we are studying 
also the SDK for Windows Phone, not only for Android and iPhone, well known by our Software Wizard, Domenico Cosentino.
Our challenge will be  to successfully organize the supply line, from a good number of suppliers.
Finally we'll succeed in scaling the production up (after delivering to our backers) only if we'll be able to increase our team size.

Known risks are:

- Higher production prices due to few units sold, increasing the number of components we have to preorder, reducing our resources.

- System integrations (especially software/electronics) might require more time than expected.

__________________________________________________________________________Qualification

Our products are constituted mainly by two parts: electronics and design.
Regarding electronic, we have a team of 3 people with a deep knowledge of analog/digital hardware. In fact our Hardware team is coming from Electronic Department of Politecnico di Milano, that is 
the biggest Electronic department in Europe. Moreover, two guys of the team carried out also research activities in this field, with about 20 articles published on international scientific journals.

Regarding Design, in our team we have an Interaction Designer with long experience. Graduated in Industrial Design with a thesis in collaboration with Philips design, since 2001 is co-founder of 
rnd_lab, developing several products, published on many Design magazines. He was selected in two edition of ADI Design Index for “Compasso d’Oro” prize, and he participated to the exhibit 
“the new Italian design” at Triennale di Milano with wall-clock “rnd_time”. Since 2011, he is teaching Visual Communication for master and degree courses at Politecnico di Milano.

</div></div>","With Teodoor, your smartphone becomes your new door key. It installs easily on the inside of your existing lock on a wide variety of doors, providing you with a complete, personal smart lock experience – in truly hands-free fashion. Using state of the art security, user-friendly installation and a well-thought app, while at the same time having a compact footprint with a sleek design.     

 Teodoor is designed to complement and complete your main entrance. It’s powered by replaceable lithium batteries and employs the latest Bluetooth technology to deliver a smart and secure home life solution. Teodoor unlocks your door  – all by himself. 

You can still use your key, your door retains its prime function. But now you have tons of options to go along.  

   

 We found the perfect formula while investing over 2 years of our time on research and development and by witnessing the current smart lock experience first hand. 

  

 Teodoor delivers truly hands-free service (unlike many that boast the same yet fail to deliver). Using a complex set of specific algorithms it determines when you’re approaching your door to unlock it, and does it for you. And just like a good doorman, it also locks the door behind you.  


  

 Teodoor senses any door movement when it’s locked and should be secure. You’ll receive a notification anywhere in the world (with the optional Wi-Fi adapter) if anyone tries to force your door open. And when it’s set to Vacation Mode, you’re notified of any activity whatsoever. 
 

  

 The Teodoor app will be available for free on the App Store and Google Play Store. It allows you to give others access rights quickly and easily (regular or restricted access, you decide). The detailed scheduled access functions can be applied in a variety of situations: daily nanny, weekly cleaner, one-time visits and more. And it's highly convenient for bed and breakfast proprietors. 

   

 Teodoor is flexible, and perfectly happy with a human touch, so it can be turned manually, just like any regular doorknob. In case you ignored that pesky low-battery notification (or just forgot your phone) you can still use the lock. Pretty handy, right?
You can always use your existing keys to unlock your door in case you don't have your smartphone with you. 

 
  

  Teodoor is designed to be contemporary yet timeless, refined yet subdued, so it pairs well with any door it’s matched up with. The battery cover and the inner/mounting ring are precisely milled to perfection from aluminium or brass, next to the grooved, easy-grip shaft.  

 Teodoor is available in three color finishes: Pebble Silver, Midnight Black, and Luxor Gold. 

    

 

  Teodoor was designed to be modular and easy to install. Setup is straightforward and takes only minutes (European installation is even faster, and done in seconds). It simply fits on the inside of your front (or other) door, right on your existing door hardware.  
 

UPDATE: Teodoor now supports Swiss cylinders!
This smart lock is compatible with most single cylinder deadbolts (common in North America) and all European cylinder locks. If you’re not sure about compatibility, leave a comment (or send us an email) and include with your lock model (an image is always a plus) and we’ll help you out. 
We’ve tested Teodoor with deadbolts from the following manufacturers: Schlage, Kwikset, Baldwin, Defiant, Weiser, Omnia, and Emtek. 

 
Here's a Teodoor installation demo, done in a couple of seconds.  

   

Teodoor uses the latest military grade encryption technologies which are also commonly used in online banking transactions. Our Bluetooth 5 capable chip (compatible with Bluetooth 4) has an additional cryptographic co-processor to enable usage of more sophisticated and safer encryption algorithms while using less processing time.
By doing that it also lowers energy consumption, so Teodoor can keep locking and unlocking your door for longer.
We are not using a central based storage system (the shared encryption key never hits our servers), so even we (or malicious hackers) cannot unlock your door.
Only Teodoor and your phone app have access to your lock.
    

 You can select the way Teodoor works for your home. Locally, being in close proximity, or globally from anywhere in the world using our specially designed Wi-Fi adapter. 

 The optional Wi-Fi adapter enables you to access Teodoor safely via the internet any time. Teodoor works perfectly without, and you can always upgrade later. The Wi-Fi adapter requires a wireless internet connection, a power source, and must be in the general proximity of Teodoor in order to communicate properly (approx. 30 ft or 10 m). 

 The Wi-Fi Adapter is available with two different socket plugs: type A (widely used in North and Central America), and type C (rest of the world). 
  

 

  Along with Teodoor, you will receive a set batteries (CR123A - commonly sold worldwide) that will last for over a year. Teodoor sends you a notification when they are almost empty. Swapping them is a breeze.

 

   
 

 
We’ve developed several prototypes over the past two years to ensure we can deliver the best experience possible, before coming to Kickstarter. No empty promises! 

 Below is a demo of our prototypes, showing locking/unlocking via the testing app, then manually unlocking and locking. The second video shows hands-free unlocking.

We hate those. Plastic bags are a big problem today, with 500 million to 1 trillion being used worldwide every year. They're made out of fossil fuels and take hundreds of years to break down. Most bags end up in landfills and get covered by other waste, limiting the necessary UV exposure they need to decompose. Even after they finally break down, they can leave harmful toxins and chemical off-gases behind causing long term environmental duress. </p><p>We wanted to eliminate plastic bags and create a better alternative to what was currently available. Our first consideration was paper. Paper bags are much better than plastic, but they're not super practical for garbage can liners. They're prone to tearing and liquids can easily limit their structural integrity. Our next consideration was bio-plastic. While bio-plastic bags are a step in the right direction, they too have many issues that make them a less than perfect solution. They often require specific conditions in order to fully break down, and most will never be properly recycled. Most will end up back in landfills where they're almost as bad as regular plastic bags.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/YknjXAb.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554918609/pemwskl2fae3pxsb5ngp.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>We found our solution in the natural compound of the Hevea Brasiliensis tree. Natural latex is a miracle material and is already widely used in a variety of products and applications. Pure natural latex is fully biodegradable and takes the same amount of time to break down as an oak leaf, approximately 4 years in normal conditions. That's quite a big jump from 500+ year decomposition rate for plastics. Our original blend includes natural latex, organic compound fillers, starch-based polymers and waste latex from other industrial uses, such as balloon and condom manufacturing. We are able to use this blend to create a strong and flexible liner material that resists leaks and tears, and breaks down quickly and efficiently even under a broad range of environmental settings. With this formula we are also able to further decrease the break down time of our liners. Utilizing latex encourages the replanting of our rain forests, and helps to keep single use plastic bags out of our oceans and landfills.  </p><p>Latex allergy is another concern we've dealt with. We are developing our liner manufacturing process to remove the protein that causes allergic reactions in a small portion of people. We use a curing bath to leach out this protein and higher vulcanization temperatures to ensure it's elimination. We hope to have fully hypoallergenic liners by the time we are ready to ship. We will also be fully transparent with what materials we are using, and Canbi liners will have labels stating that they contain latex.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/jh70F0B.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>Canbi is an important step in the evolution of waste management.

We are developing our liner manufacturing process to remove the protein that causes allergic reactions in a small portion of people. We use a curing bath to leach out this protein and higher vulcanization temperatures to ensure it's elimination. We hope to have fully hypoallergenic liners by the time we are ready to ship. We will also be fully transparent with what materials we are using, and Canbi liners will have labels stating that they contain latex.Canbi is an important step in the evolution of waste management. It's setting the new standard of what we as a society view as acceptable for our environment. It's changing the way we use our planets resources. Canbi is putting a stronger emphasis on long term solutions that have a positive impact on our global health. It's time we made a change in how we interact with our world. Let's clean up with Canbi.Canbi liners are 100% biodegradable. We use a proprietary blend of natural latex, recycled waste latex, starch based polymers and an organic compound blend to produce our high quality liners. We are constantly tweaking our unique formula to improve biodegradability rates and decrease overall break down times. View our chart below to find the perfect reward tier for you. Take advantage of our Super Early Bird options and save big before they're gone!If we reach $70,000 CAD we will release the Canbi Obsidian model as an upgrade. For those that prefer a darker aesthetic, Canbi Obsidian is the can for you. Available in both sizes, this super slick model will surely turn some heads. To select this model in your reward package, please specify your preferred colour in our backer survey which will be sent out after the campaign is completed. To add extra liners to your purchase, add 10$ CAD to your pledge amount for each additional set of 25. To add extra deodorizers, add 5$ CAD to your pledge amount for each additional deodorizer. Orders will be confirmed at the end of the campaign.After our campaign ends we will have liners and deodorizers for sale on our website. We are also working to have them available on Amazon worldwide. We know you'll love Canbi as much as we do. We are determined to create a meaningful difference in the world and help put an end to plastic pollution. If you want to support Canbi please don't hesitate to share our campaign with all of your friends and family, and together we can create a greener tomorrow. Your support is greatly appreciated.Risks and challengesEvery project comes with its own risks and challenges. We are doing our best to plan for as much as possible, but sometimes delays and unforeseen obstacles can come up. In the event that we are met with these circumstances we vow to be fully transparent with our backers, and work our hardest to address any delays or issues that may arise. We promise to post regular updates on our progress and ensure that our backers are fully aware of where we stand.",37.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Priced at $25,000 for the base model, NOMAD’s goal is to reduce consumerism and focus on an affordable and sustainable housing option for the largest portion of our society: hard-working individuals who can't make ends meet due to the high cost of living. Adding our pre-engineered green packages for solar energy, rainwater collection and grey water treatment can take NOMAD’s right off the grid. </p>

<h3>Why is NOMAD important?</h3>
<p>The Tiny House Movement is currently driven by individuals at a grass-roots level who, for the most part, have built their own homes and are living sustainable, mortgage-free lives. Recognizing the importance of these progressive dwellings and the philosophy adopted by their occupants, NOMAD has taken on the challenge of making this affordable housing option accessible worldwide. </p>

<p>Adapt your existing curtains instead of replacing them. We at SwitchBot are firm believers in <span>retrofitting your home to create a smart home instead of replacing trusty old appliances or furniture that are still in work well.</span></p>
<p>Retrofitting is simple with SwitchBot Curtain. It only takes a few seconds to make your existing curtains smart. You have to see it to believe it. </p>
<p><a href=""https://gifyu.com/image/vFko"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""61d79d1aa92906ebf.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s5.gifyu.com/images/61d79d1aa92906ebf.gif"" src=""""/></a></p>

<p>The average price of a set of smart curtains is USD 1,000. The SwitchBot Curtain is way more cost-effective at a fraction of that price. You don’t just save money with the SwitchBot Curtain, you do your part for the environment by retaining your existing curtains instead of throwing it away.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><span>We support 99% curtains</span></h2>
<p>Some smart curtain solutions only support a single type of curtains. Others are too bulky or require tedious modifications to provide a power source.</p>
<p>The SwitchBot Curtain supports different track types such as U-rail and I-rail, and also rod types. It is also wireless. Just clip it on and you're ready to go. It is that simple. </p>

<p>Double-sided curtains are very common and we have been getting a lot of inquiries about how to use the SwitchBot Curtain with these. You could get two units and part the double-sided curtains from the middle. Or, you could try out this tip from the King of Retrofit! Attach the top curtains with a velcro strip or a strong clip so the curtains will move as one. Then install the SwitchBot Curtain on either end to let it work its magic!</p>
<p><a href=""https://gifyu.com/image/vFke"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""135f4b2aa4b39b1e87.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s5.gifyu.com/images/135f4b2aa4b39b1e87.gif"" src=""""/></a></p>

<p>Our co-founder and CEO, Connery, has been the in IoT industry specializing in smart home for years.

   Seeing is Believing 
Rods and Rails, Retrofitted.
 
Works with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Siri, SmartThings and IFTTT with the Hub 
 
Energy savingEven the most eco-friendly air-conditioning consumes energy to cool your room. We can reduce energy consumption by minimizing temperature fluctuations in your room. Close the curtains to block out sunlight to keep your room cool.

Sun light sensor for keeping the room cool
 
The SwitchBot Curtain has a built-in sun light sensor to detect sunlight. This can help save energy by reducing the workload on your air-conditioning and heating. It can be set to automatically close during the day time in summer to block out the sunlight and keep your room cool. You can also have it automatically open during the day in winter to warm your room with sunlight.

   
Save energy with the solar panel strip add-on
 
You can also install the solar power strip add-on to charge the SwitchBot Curtain’s battery using sunlight, thus eliminating the need to recharge the battery. Don't worry about ""charging anxiety"" on the SwitchBot Curtain. Install and forget!
 
Smart living
Leverage technology to take care of the daily routines through automation and voice control. A ""Lights Off"" scene turns off the light and draws the curtains brighten the room naturally with sunlight. Or you can just say it  ""Alexa/Ok Google/Hey Siri, give me sunlight"".

Lifestyle automated with the Schedule feature
 
Healthy lifestyle
Maintain a regular light-dark cycle in your bedroom to keep your sleep-wake rhythm in sync with your circadian rhythm. The SwitchBot Curtain can be set to close at night and open when it senses daylight. Get better sleep and wake naturally to sunshine. 

Wake up naturally to sunlight
 
Anti-theft
Set your curtains to close automatically when you’re out of the house to hide your valuables from prying eyes. Can’t remember if you closed the window? Check via our app and remotely close the curtains where necessary. Or set them to automatically open at regular intervals to give the impression that someone's home.

Your curtain keeps the bad guy away.
 

Adapt your existing curtains instead of replacing them. We at SwitchBot are firm believers in retrofitting your home to create a smart home instead of replacing trusty old appliances or furniture that are still in work well.
Retrofitting is simple with SwitchBot Curtain. It only takes a few seconds to make your existing curtains smart. You have to see it to believe it. 

Seeing is believing
 
The average price of a set of smart curtains is USD 1,000. The SwitchBot Curtain is way more cost-effective at a fraction of that price. You don’t just save money with the SwitchBot Curtain, you do your part for the environment by retaining your existing curtains instead of throwing it away.
 
We support 99% curtains
Some smart curtain solutions only support a single type of curtains. Others are too bulky or require tedious modifications to provide a power source.
The SwitchBot Curtain supports different track types such as U-rail and I-rail, and also rod types. It is also wireless. Just clip it on and you're ready to go. It is that simple. 

We even handle that ""BUMP"" for extendable rods and rails
 

Rods, retrofitted

The round rails allow the SwitchBot Curtain to glide smoothly along the rod. Just clip on the rails and you're all set.
For those of you who have a longer rod with a bump where the rod extends, we've got that figured out. The SwitchBot Curtain is not affected by such bumps.

Install in seconds
 

 

U Rails, retrofitted
The SwitchBot Curtain has hooks for U-rail. It is simple to attach the respective hooks to the rails.  
  
Install in seconds
 

 

I Rails, retrofitted
The SwitchBot Curtain has hooks for I-rail. It is simple to attach the respective hooks to the rails. 

Install in seconds
 

 

Open and close the curtain at your fingertip. We offer intuitive App control for iOS and Android, with weekly/bi-weekly updates following feedback from you. OTA firmware update is also available for better user experience.

Intuitive UI
 

Smart living is powered by your voice commands.
Wouldn't it be great to just say it?

""Alexa/Ok Google/Hey Siri, close my curtain please"" (Hub is required)
 

Even with SwitchBot Curtain, you'd probably still instinctively draw the curtains by hand some times. When it senses you drawing the curtain, the SwitchBot Curtain will kick in and do the work for you. We call this Touch & Go.

SwitchBot Curtain makes even the conventional way to draw a curtain smarter.
 

A wireless remote button add-on for you to place anywhere. 

Hold it or mount it. Your say.
 

Double-sided curtains are very common and we have been getting a lot of inquiries about how to use the SwitchBot Curtain with these. You could get two units and part the double-sided curtains from the middle. Or, you could try out this tip from the King of Retrofit! Attach the top curtains with a velcro strip or a strong clip so the curtains will move as one. Then install the SwitchBot Curtain on either end to let it work its magic!

 
So your next question is probably where to find a velcro strip. The good news is, we believe so strongly in retrofitting that we will ship every SwitchBot Curtain with a velcro strip in the box as a standard accessory.

 

The SwitchBot Curtain is so small that it hides nicely behind your curtains. It will work in its own way without getting in your way.  Likewise, we keep the sophisticated mechanism within the body of the SwitchBot Curtain, giving you fast and easy installation so you can enjoy the benefits it brings.   

Size fits in your palm.
 

Instead of a wired system, the SwitchBot Curtain is a wireless solution. It uses a rechargeable battery that lasts 8 months depending on the usage. This means you only need to charge it once or twice a year! 
What's more, you can forget about having to charge it by getting the solar power strip add-on. Sunlight will ensure the SwitchBot Curtain is charged up for its daily work routine.

 


Our SwitchBot Curtain is very complicated from the inside so it is so SIMPLE for you on the outside.


In the box, 2 types of hooks will be there for your preference.

If we haven't met yet, I'm a dad of five from England, currently residing in Virginia in the U.S., with my wife Katie, four kids, two dogs and a cat!


I met Francis 'Quame' Adu, through a mutual friend, about 5 years ago now...Quame was in Nkoranza, in central Ghana, Africa. Where he and his family had started to take orphaned and abandoned kids in off the streets. Watch the video I shot with Quame, where he explains how the orphanage was started when they took in Charity, the first 'Love Kids' child.
Quame is now in England, where he lives and works, and sends money back to Nkoranza on a monthly basis, to help feed, clothe and school the kids. While at the same time being a father to his own daughter, Evie...


He's an incredible human being, who simply has a desire to help others. And despite growing up in humble surroundings himself, would give any money that he had left over to the street kids that he would see near his home, in Nkoranza.Fast forward a few years, and Love Kids currently has six kids that are cared for, as numbers were reduced due to lack of funds to support more children. This is something that we intend to change.A few years ago, I promised Quame that I would help him with his dream to make Love Kids a fully self-sustaining foundation. With a new home on new property, able to grow their own food and generate their own income through various small-business activities.Now is that time. But where do you come in?
   What We Need
 Before we can start to raise the funds for a new property, we need to provide some solid foundations for the kids and Quame's family at the current orphanage home, by paying the rent for the next 24 months by the time it comes due on February 25th, 2015.
The rent for the next 2 years (which has to be paid in advance), is 5,000 Ghana Cedis. Which converts to 1,029 British Pounds, or 1,546 US Dollars.
That's were this campaign and your good self come in! ;-)
As soon as that rent is paid, we can then shift the focus to the master project of constructing a new home, on the parcel of land that we already have, in Nkoranza.That's the big project...this is the small one.And we got this...with your help!
   The Impact When we raise the necessary £1,029 to cover the rent, the future for Love Kids is secure for the next two years.Without it...well, we won't let it happen, so we won't go there.
We will make it happen (with your help).
With that solid foundation in place, we will be able to focus not only on the big picture, but on what's most important...taking care of the kids on a daily basis.





   Why this? For me personally, I made a promise to Quame and I fully intend to honour that promise.For yourself, you get to know that you are DIRECTLY impacting the lives of orphaned and abandoned kids. Kids who may have lost their parents through HIV/AIDS, or who's grandparents are no longer able to care for them.
Literally, keeping them off the streets.Now I don't know about you, but as a father myself and as a human being, I simply can't comprehend young children have to sell water and fend for themselves, like Charity did (see the video) before Quame found her and took her into their family home.
In the 21st Century... a time of such abundance, is it really acceptable that kids (yes, young children) don't have a bed to sleep in, food to eat, or someone to care for them?Is this really the best we can do?

    Other Ways You Can Help If you are not able to contribute financially at this time, that's ok! We appreciate any support you may be able to give by spreading the word about Love Kids...

A VPN helps users bypass internet restrictions such as censored or geo-restricted content while providing anonymity by masking their IP address and location. We believe freedom to access information online is a basic right. Betternet Technologies Inc. is the team behind the Betterspot project. We have over 5 years of experience providing secure VPN services for more than 40 million users around the globe. Our team has proven its place as your first VPN choice on the world wide web.</p><p>As smart devices and IoT are quickly and inevitably becoming part of our daily lives, the need for a safe, secure and a fast VPN service becomes essential. We noticed it had become a challenge to find a VPN app that works on all your devices, in the home or at the office. To meet this challenge, Betternet decided to create Betterspot, a device which easily connects to your router providing VPN functions to all of your WiFi devices such as tablets, smartphones, laptops, PCs, etc. Betterspot is compatible with various operating systems such as Windows, Ubuntu, OS X, Android, iOS, Blackberry, etc. By supporting Betterspot, you are supporting a device which will provide security, privacy, and freedom of information to millions. By using Betterspot, you yourself may find the internet quite simply better.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Design</h2><p>Some may overlook design as an essential feature of a VPN router, supposing it should just bypass the internet restrictions. Going the extra mile for us means making Betterspot a beautifully designed and efficient product which exceeds our customers’ expectations.</p><p>Betterspot, distinguished by the Betternet Shield located on top of it, may be one of the most modern, exciting, convenient and user-friendly VPN routers on the market. After six months of effort and research, our professional design team has created two models. Based on the user feedback we ensured that not only the functionality was streamlined, but also the design remained sleek and attractive.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500444264/qczfwgb3l6crr33ma5mg.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Our team considered every detail in the process of developing Betterspot, including a multi-color LED which shows Betterspot’s status to the user. Two Ethernet ports and a micro USB port are neatly placed at the back of the device. Surrounding these key components is a hard ABS polymer case. You’ll know it’s a quality product because like our Betternet App it features the shield logo you’ve come to trust.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Betterspot Press</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500444345/y0yphlraekoy0m1knneq.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Betterspot App</h2><p><strong>All settings in your hand</strong><br/>Betterspot allows you to control the device easily through your smartphone.

Through inspiring feedback we were able to construct a product that meets all your demands. We realized that Betternet users enthusiastically require using Betternet on all of their smart devices such as smart TVs, Windows phones, Mac computers, Blackberries and Apple TVs, but unfortunately, VPN apps cannot be installed on all these devices.</p><p>As we traveled abroad we were faced with online restrictions and censorship. This encouraged us to design Betternet, a VPN service that has now more than 40 million users. To ensure we were on the right path during each stage of development we engaged our users across the globe. The first stop was China where we asked our users for feedback about Betternet VPN, which in turn further encouraged us to develop the hardware. Thanks to our customers’ comments, we had a new idea: a device you could simply connect all your smart devices too. A device that is small, portable, easy to use and empowered with our award winning Premium VPN service: Betternet. By running the VPN for your smart device, Betterspot will reduce the exhaustion of your smart devices' battery life.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500445709/aaikivqyrgiw6wqa25bl.png"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><p> </p><h2>Our Team</h2><p>Betterspot team is comprised of top notch tech experts, experienced hardware engineers, embedded developers and designers who are part of Betternet Technologies, an established company providing VPN services to more than 40 million people across the globe with more than 5 years of experience in this business.

We went to ""Asian Innovation Tour"" on our first trip. There, we shared our idea and could attract many manufacturers' and investors' attention. We chose them carefully based on their quality and experiences. We also found some options for packaging and shipping.<br/>On our second travel to China, we signed the contract and visited the factories again to double check the quality.<br/>Betterspot QC trip was the last and longest one. It was both exciting and exhausting. Exciting, since we tested Betterspot everywhere like coffee shops, restaurants, and hotels. It was very enjoyable to see the working Betterspot.

A VPN helps users bypass internet restrictions such as censored or geo-restricted content while providing anonymity by masking their IP address and location. We believe freedom to access information online is a basic right. Betternet Technologies Inc. is the team behind the Betterspot project. We have over 5 years of experience providing secure VPN services for more than 40 million users around the globe. Our team has proven its place as your first VPN choice on the world wide web.As smart devices and IoT are quickly and inevitably becoming part of our daily lives, the need for a safe, secure and a fast VPN service becomes essential. We noticed it had become a challenge to find a VPN app that works on all your devices, in the home or at the office. To meet this challenge, Betternet decided to create Betterspot, a device which easily connects to your router providing VPN functions to all of your WiFi devices such as tablets, smartphones, laptops, PCs, etc. Betterspot is compatible with various operating systems such as Windows, Ubuntu, OS X, Android, iOS, Blackberry, etc. By supporting Betterspot, you are supporting a device which will provide security, privacy, and freedom of information to millions. By using Betterspot, you yourself may find the internet quite simply better.  DesignSome may overlook design as an essential feature of a VPN router, supposing it should just bypass the internet restrictions. Going the extra mile for us means making Betterspot a beautifully designed and efficient product which exceeds our customers’ expectations.Betterspot, distinguished by the Betternet Shield located on top of it, may be one of the most modern, exciting, convenient and user-friendly VPN routers on the market. After six months of effort and research, our professional design team has created two models. Based on the user feedback we ensured that not only the functionality was streamlined, but also the design remained sleek and attractive.Our team considered every detail in the process of developing Betterspot, including a multi-color LED which shows Betterspot’s status to the user. Two Ethernet ports and a micro USB port are neatly placed at the back of the device. Surrounding these key components is a hard ABS polymer case. You’ll know it’s a quality product because like our Betternet App it features the shield logo you’ve come to trust.  Betterspot Press  Betterspot AppAll settings in your handBetterspot allows you to control the device easily through your smartphone. You just need to install it on one device and the rest will connect and pair to Betterspot without any need to install apps.VPN (Betternet)Connect to Betternet premium service to increase your security and privacy and choose between multiple server locations. Encrypting your data, Betternet secures your connection. It changes your IP address and hides your real locations. It helps you access blocked websites, and bypass internet censorship and firewalls. Betternet lets you access different streaming channels everywhere; even when you are traveling. TorYou can switch to Tor anonymity network and surf anonymously. It hides you from the other users on the network, so the more populous and diverse the user base for Tor is, the more your anonymity will be protected. Tor allows you to improve your privacy and security on the Internet. It also lets organizations and individuals share information over public networks without compromising their privacy.Direct ModeYou can turn the VPN off by choosing this mode. In this mode, Betterspot functions like a normal router. If you only use a secure connection for certain services and prefer to browse the net using your own IP address, we made it easy for you to switch between VPN/TOR and Direct mode. In Direct mode, your router acts like a messenger: it only sends your requests to the internet without any modifications.Location selectionChoose your desired server location from the menu. We provide a broad range of dedicated, and premium servers all around the world.  How to useConnection via cable:1   Turn on Betterspot.2   Plug in the input cable to connect Betterspot to the internet source.3   Now connect your device to Betterspot using Wi-Fi and enter the password.

Through inspiring feedback we were able to construct a product that meets all your demands. We realized that Betternet users enthusiastically require using Betternet on all of their smart devices such as smart TVs, Windows phones, Mac computers, Blackberries and Apple TVs, but unfortunately, VPN apps cannot be installed on all these devices.As we traveled abroad we were faced with online restrictions and censorship. This encouraged us to design Betternet, a VPN service that has now more than 40 million users. To ensure we were on the right path during each stage of development we engaged our users across the globe. The first stop was China where we asked our users for feedback about Betternet VPN, which in turn further encouraged us to develop the hardware. Thanks to our customers’ comments, we had a new idea: a device you could simply connect all your smart devices too. A device that is small, portable, easy to use and empowered with our award winning Premium VPN service: Betternet. By running the VPN for your smart device, Betterspot will reduce the exhaustion of your smart devices' battery life.  Our TeamBetterspot team is comprised of top notch tech experts, experienced hardware engineers, embedded developers and designers who are part of Betternet Technologies, an established company providing VPN services to more than 40 million people across the globe with more than 5 years of experience in this business. Our mobile app developers and DevOps have designed one of the most reliable and compatible VPN protocols which are tested for over a year and now empowers Betterspot VPN router. Our diligent CRM team constantly responds to the users' questions and relays their feedback to our development team which in turn fine tunes our service and product.Our industrious team is still on the go and working hard to bring Betterspot to life. We are grateful to the potential Kickstarter backers for supporting us to achieve this goal. Your support will give us the opportunity to put Betterspot in your home.   China TripTo bring Betterspot's idea to a real product, we have traveled to China for three times. We went to ""Asian Innovation Tour"" on our first trip. There, we shared our idea and could attract many manufacturers' and investors' attention. We chose them carefully based on their quality and experiences. We also found some options for packaging and shipping.On our second travel to China, we signed the contract and visited the factories again to double check the quality.Betterspot QC trip was the last and longest one. It was both exciting and exhausting. Exciting, since we tested Betterspot everywhere like coffee shops, restaurants, and hotels. It was very enjoyable to see the working Betterspot. Exhausting, because it was very difficult to manage everything among our 4 partners including OEM, Molding, Packaging, and shipping. They were very far from each other. Sometimes, we had to visit all of them all in a single day.We could successfully overcome the issues regarding Betterspot manufacturing during our trip. Our industrious team is still on the go and working hard to bring Betterspot to life.Your support will give us the opportunity to put Betterspot in your home. What HWTrek thinks about Betterspot! ShippingWe are delighted to inform you that we have started shipping Betterspot devices.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’m John Staehlin an 87-year-old mechanical engineer, inventor, and founder of Volunteers for Medical Engineering (VME). Inventing has been my life. 37 years at Westinghouse, six years at Northrop Grumman. 37 years ago I founded VME and began designing devices for people living with disabilities. We have developed solutions such as mobile standing frame, servo driven hand closure devices, blink writing system, etc. Since moving to Carroll Lutheran Village 10 years ago many of my inventions have been directed towards the senior population. Seniors want to live in their home as long as possible. If they use a mobility device such as a wheelchair or scooter the entrance to their home becomes a major barrier, especially with the typical combination of the storm door and the main door at  the entrance.  A search showed that no commercial devices are available.</p>
<p>I have invented, designed and am ready, with the help of funding from this campaign, to build  prototypes of my “Opposing Door Opener” (ODO ) mechanism.. With the ODO installed between the doors we can provide unimpeded entry into the home for all of our friends, neighbors and relatives.</p>
<p>I have taken the design and fabrication about as far as I can afford to take it. Your donations will be the force that brings this revolutionary product to the public.</p>
<p>With your funding. I will be able to machine parts for the mechanism, purchase the components  needed for the drive mechanism, complete electrical design and updating of the CAD database for production.</p>
<p>Significant effort will be directed towards building and testing prototypes to enable unimpeded access to a home. I can only offer you my sincere thanks along with the satisfaction of knowing that you have made this product available to the public as we record your name for posterity in the product's owner manual..</p>
<p><strong>PERKS</strong></p>
<p>Here is the special Perk that I have to offer to all donors. If you know of someone with a disability that has an unaddressed problem I am prepared to address the problem (as I’ve done for the last 37 years) as follows:</p>
<p>·        Platinum donor ($500 plus) two hours of consultation directed to a proposed solution.</p>
<p>·        Gold donor ($400 plus) 1 ½ hours of consultation directed to a proposed solution.</p>
<p>·        Silver donor ($300 plus) one hour of consultation directed to a proposed solution.</p>
<p>·        Bronze donor ($200 plus) one half hour of consultation directed to a proposed solution.</p>
<p>·        Donor response will  email be by with suggested approach to solution</p>
<p>Response to Donors will be in the order they were submitted with the donation. They will also be addressed as time allows over and above the Opposing Door Open product development time line.</p>
<p>They will be addressed!</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve had the good fortune to see people use their hands for the first time, see people communicate even though paralyzed, watch people, raise themselves out of a chair with an assistive device, use power tools in the artificial arms, grip a ball with artificial and, etc. The donors to this campaign will get to see people in wheelchairs entering their home past the storm door and passed the main door with unimpeded access.</p>
<p>Phase one: build and test two manually control “Opposing Door Opener” prototypes.</p>
<p>Phase two: design, electronics for automated control of “Opposing Door Opener” prototypes, assemble and test.</p>
<p>Phase three: design, test and evaluate alternative manufacturing techniques and incorporate where applicable.</p>

I’m John Staehlin an 87-year-old mechanical engineer, inventor, and founder of Volunteers for Medical Engineering (VME). Inventing has been my life. 37 years at Westinghouse, six years at Northrop Grumman. 37 years ago I founded VME and began designing devices for people living with disabilities. We have developed solutions such as mobile standing frame, servo driven hand closure devices, blink writing system, etc. Since moving to Carroll Lutheran Village 10 years ago many of my inventions have been directed towards the senior population. Seniors want to live in their home as long as possible. If they use a mobility device such as a wheelchair or scooter the entrance to their home becomes a major barrier, especially with the typical combination of the storm door and the main door at  the entrance.  A search showed that no commercial devices are available.
I have invented, designed and am ready, with the help of funding from this campaign, to build  prototypes of my “Opposing Door Opener” (ODO ) mechanism.. With the ODO installed between the doors we can provide unimpeded entry into the home for all of our friends, neighbors and relatives.
I have taken the design and fabrication about as far as I can afford to take it. Your donations will be the force that brings this revolutionary product to the public.
With your funding. I will be able to machine parts for the mechanism, purchase the components  needed for the drive mechanism, complete electrical design and updating of the CAD database for production.
Significant effort will be directed towards building and testing prototypes to enable unimpeded access to a home. I can only offer you my sincere thanks along with the satisfaction of knowing that you have made this product available to the public as we record your name for posterity in the product's owner manual..
PERKS
Here is the special Perk that I have to offer to all donors. If you know of someone with a disability that has an unaddressed problem I am prepared to address the problem (as I’ve done for the last 37 years) as follows:
·        Platinum donor ($500 plus) two hours of consultation directed to a proposed solution.
·        Gold donor ($400 plus) 1 ½ hours of consultation directed to a proposed solution.
·        Silver donor ($300 plus) one hour of consultation directed to a proposed solution.
·        Bronze donor ($200 plus) one half hour of consultation directed to a proposed solution.
·        Donor response will  email be by with suggested approach to solution
Response to Donors will be in the order they were submitted with the donation. They will also be addressed as time allows over and above the Opposing Door Open product development time line.
They will be addressed!
Over the years I’ve had the good fortune to see people use their hands for the first time, see people communicate even though paralyzed, watch people, raise themselves out of a chair with an assistive device, use power tools in the artificial arms, grip a ball with artificial and, etc. The donors to this campaign will get to see people in wheelchairs entering their home past the storm door and passed the main door with unimpeded access.
Phase one: build and test two manually control “Opposing Door Opener” prototypes.
Phase two: design, electronics for automated control of “Opposing Door Opener” prototypes, assemble and test.
Phase three: design, test and evaluate alternative manufacturing techniques and incorporate where applicable.

<p>The Morris House, the second oldest wooden building in Halifax, will soon be transported from Hollis Street, to a donated lot at the corner of Creighton and Charles. Once settled on its new foundation, an addition will be constructed, and the building will become affordable, energy efficient housing for young adults. The Morris House has become a symbol of Halifax’s heritage and culture, of youth engagement and adaptive re-use of existing buildings. It is a demonstration of sustainable building practices that can guide our city’s future growth.</p>
<p>Many fundraising efforts are underway and the “House on the Move” needs YOUR help! Help us raise $15 000, which will go directly to the cost of moving the house.</p>
<p>Lead partners in the Project are <a href=""http://homeatmnpha.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Metro Non-Profit Housing Association</a>; <a href=""http://www.arkoutreach.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The ARK, a drop-in centre for young adults</a>; <a href=""http://www.htns.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Heritage Trust of Nova Scotia</a> and the <a href=""http://www.ecologyaction.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ecology Action Centre.</a></p>
<p>We are incredibly grateful for your contributions to help Move the Morris House - every dollar contributed will go directly to moving it.  We could not do this without your support!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></p>
<p>We need $15,000, all of which will go directly to the cost of moving the Morris House. The Morris House is the second oldest wood structure in Halifax, and an important symbol of our city’s social and architectural history. Why move it? To show that we don’t have to needlessly demolish old buildings - we can and should incorporate the old with the new, to build a resilient and sustainable Halifax AND to provide much needed affordable housing for young adults.</p>
<p><strong>Donate, and receive a package of our unique perks!</strong></p>
<p><strong>For $10</strong>, you will receive a silk screened Morris House patch, hand made by participants of the ARK, a drop-in centre for young adults, and one of the project’s partners.</p>
<p><strong>For $25 </strong>you'll get a unique hand crafted Morris House felt pin created by a local artist.</p>
<p><strong>For $50</strong>, you’ll get both the ARK silkscreened patch, plus a unique hand crafted Morris House felt badge.</p>
<p><strong>$100</strong> gets you the $50 perks, plus a limited edition engraved brick from the original Morris House site, commemorating its history and the Move the Morris project.</p>
<p>As a unique collaboration between heritage, green building, young adults and affordable housing advocates, the Morris house has inspired people of all ages, from all walks of life. It is a model of sustainable development, showing how diverse interests can come together to provide cities and towns with shared social, cultural and environmental benefits. It is a story of resilience, creativity and determination.</p>

</div></div>","Are you an unfortunate user of separate taps? Are you tired of choosing between freezing cold and scalding hot water to wash your hands, brush your teeth or do the dishes? 
Is this how you wash your hands? 







Well, you no longer have to! 
Retromixer is a patent pending, easy to use, adjustable and affordable adapter that will mix your hot and cold water streams, allowing you to enjoy warm water of adjustable temperature.  




Our research revealed that most users simply turn on both of the taps, but use only one tap at a time. This means that the water flowing out of one tap goes directly to the drain and is wasted.  







Retromixer will not only make washing your hands more convenient, it will also help you save water and energy. On top of that, it's made from recycled plastics and helps save the environment. Hurray!  












Retromixer can be easily disassembled and cleaned.  



 



It is designed to fit various double tap configurations. The adjustable straps provide grip to even the weirdest shaped taps. 





Currently, Retromixer fits taps with a distance of 16 to 24cm apart, which covers the vast majority of two tap sinks (we plan to improve that in the future to cover even more). 








Separate taps are a problem that we know all too well. 







After months of dealing with extremely hot and cold water and discussing the problem with other people, we decided it was time for action. We do not only believe in our idea- we invested our money and time in it! 

Several prototypes were made for testing and getting feedback from first users.  






This allowed us to validate the concept and improve the design... 






...and 3D-print even more prototypes... 





...until the final design emerged! 









The next stage of our project is to initiate serial production. We found several European manufacturers who meet our requirements for technology, quality and cost. 

All materials used for production are certified as food and drink safe (FDA-approved). 
For the first batch of Retromixers, we need to raise a total of £7,000. We have already raised £3,000 and aim to gather the missing £4,000 via this campaign. 
If we manage to raise £6,000 or more, we will be able to deliver Retromixers in different colors, so that you can customize your Retromixer the way you like!  


 

(colors shown above serve as an example. We can't tell how many different color versions we can offer until the campaign is finished- see Risks and Challenges section) 


RECYCLED MATERIALS x WATER SAVING = REDUCED CARBON FOOTPRINT 

Sustainability is at the heart of this project. Making recycled plastics the material of choice has several advantages. 
•	Manufacturing process requires about 50% less energy, therefore reducing greenhouse gasses emitted in the process. 
•	Plastics are not biodegradable; recycling prevents inefficient landfill and ocean contamination.

DESIGN 

The product design is mature and we are in the final stages of prototype testing. Some minor design change could still occur which might postpone the delivery, but by no more than two weeks. 

MANUFACTURING 


To minimize the risks, we decided to keep the production in Europe and shortlisted several manufacturers that meet our expectations regarding the technology, quality and cost. 

Nevertheless, there is risk involved. There is no serial production yet and we will be working with manufacturers we have never worked with before. We will conduct background checks and due diligence audits to ensure manufacturer's capacity to deliver a quality product on time. 

DIFFERENT COLOR VERSIONS 


If we reach our stretch goal of £6,000, we will offer Retromixer in different colors. However, until we know how much money we raised, it is impossible to tell how many versions can be offered. As you would imagine, the more money we raise, the more colors will be offered.",28.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>We are a group of Wisconsin landowners concerned about Canadian oil pipeline company Enbridge’s plans to construct a new oil pipeline through Wisconsin. A new pipeline means Enbridge needs more land. Many of us already have an 80 foot wide Enbridge easement across our properties with four pipelines running through it (hence our name, 80 Feet is Enough!).  Enbridge has recently completed land surveys for a new pipeline adjacent to existing easements. In addition, in 2015 Enbridge worked behind the scenes to change Wisconsin’s eminent domain law, making it easier for them to take private property by condemnation.</p>
<p>If Enbridge takes more of our land, it means we (every property owner along the route) can’t use our properties the way we want because of the restrictions placed on buildings, construction activities, tree planting, etc.  This oil will travel through Wisconsin, much of it likely to be refined on the Gulf Coast and exported to overseas markets. It is un-American that a foreign company could take OUR land, for their private gain.</p>
<p>If  there is an oil leak or explosion we could lose our homes, water, farms, even our lives. One such leak of about 40 gallons several years ago resulted in an area family having to move because of contaminated well water.</p>
<p>The public needs to know that Wisconsin now has rules that would allow a private company to take their land.  To help spread the word, we are planning to purchase billboard space along several heavily-traveled highways throughout Wisconsin. But billboard advertising is expensive. Our goal is to raise $25,000 for billboards.</p>
<p>We hope you will consider helping us in our grassroots fight against eminent domain abuse by a foreign pipeline company. All donations will be very helpful and greatly appreciated. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help build a groundswell of public opposition to Enbridge's abuse of property rights and the unconscionable use of eminent domain for private gain. Enbridge worked behind the scenes to changed Wisconsin's eminent domain law in 2015 without public knowledge. The billboards will raise awareness and galvanize Wisconsin citizens to restore their property rights.</p>
<p>The billboard messages are relevant nationwide. Unlike gas pipelines which are granted eminent domain powers by the federal government, oil pipeline companies are granted the power of eminent domain at the state level. That's why Enbridge found it so important for their planned expansion to change the eminent domain law in Wisconsin. </p>
<p>The grassroots groundwork we are laying here in Wisconsin can be used by citizens in other states to stop oil pipeline companies from having undue power in taking property.</p>
<p>Every dollar you donate will be dedicated to raising billboards throughout Wisconsin. If we are so fortunate, all funds exceeding our goal will go towards working at the Wisconsin legislative level to reform the eminent domain law and prevent oil pipeline companies from land takings.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have a clear strategy and dedicated volunteers. Our two main challenges are funding and public awareness and that is why we designed this campaign.</p>
<p>If we do not meet our goal, we will place as many billboards as we can afford. The greater the funding the more billboards we can place for a longer period of time in larger high-profile markets.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>An Introduction</h2>
<p>Ever thought how you could get involved in one of the most lucrative fields of endeavour, the business which has created many, many ultra wealthy men and women over the years worldwide?</p>
<p>Well, I am a 39 year old guy who's been involved in some interesting international projects from the US, Europe, the Far East and Africa, having run a number of very successful projects from start to finish.</p>
<p>I've always had a plethora of ideas for new ventures, and I've finally decided to bring one to market in an effort to help everyone who's always been interested in property but been too afraid to ask.</p>
<p>It all started when I had a number of retirement policies, policies I've always had questions about. I've always wondered how good they will be 10 or 20 years after I retire. I've always wondered if 75% of my income at retirement will be enough after 30 years have passed. It was because of these questions that I decided to investigate the property market with its residual inflation linked income and, it's because of this that that I've been working for years on Property Advisor as a concept, an idea and a prototype.</p>
<p>I started off creating a spreadsheet with thousands of cells and hundreds of formulas giving me all the information that I wanted. However, it was never really feasible carrying around a pc whenever I went to view a property, so I began thinking that it would be great to have this concept as an app available on an iPad and make it available for the whole world to use.</p>
<p>Well, on to the product I'm trying to fund and I'm holding thumbs for every one of you to help get this out there so we can all get involved in property that much easier.</p>
<h2>Property Advisor</h2>
<p><strong>Property Advisor</strong> is a world first for the iPad market giving you the information to make informed decisions about property investment.</p>
<p>Imagine buying an average house for an average price, in a good area, and only paying 6% of the cost of the house. Would you buy it?</p>
<p>Download Property Advisor to find out how little you'll be paying for a property when you buy-to-let with all the complex calculations and formulas done for you giving you a simple rating at the end. And also, for everyone who wants all the nitty-gritty details, they are all still in there for you.</p>
<h3>Retire early, retire strong!</h3>
<p>In recent proven statistics, it’s said that even if you manage to save 15% of your gross income for an entire 40 years, it is still not enough to last you in to your 70’s and 80’s. According to the experts in the industry, we should be saving 15% of our gross income for the entire 40 years and, they make assurances that we'll retire happy, wealthy and have more than enough to get through the rest of the years. Even according to their own calculations, your pension will start running short within 5 years even if you cut expenses.</p>
<p>While inflation keeps happening, unless it's truly index-linked, your pension will still keep paying the same and it will eventually be a fraction of what you started out with. 75% Of your salary now won’t be worth much in 10 years when the cost of living doubles and you’re still earning 75% of what you were getting 10 years ago.</p>
<p>It is said that most millionaires have a minimum of seven streams of income and, the best kind is passive income. Property gives you the power to not only create inflation-based revenue streams long after you retire, but to also have an asset at the end of the bond which has been paid off by someone else. Imagine retiring 20 years early, or even 10 years earlier, living off income generated by your properties?</p>
<h3>Why property?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Property allows you to generate wealth by means of several income streams.</li>
<li>Even though property is your business, you'll still never have to personally deal with tenants.</li>
<li>Using Property Advisor, you'll be able to quickly, and easily, evaluate any property before buying giving you values such as future return and capital outlay.</li>
<li>Property offers one of the highest returns with the lowest risk of all asset classes.</li>
<li>Income streams from a buy-to-let business are linked to inflation and the chances are that you will never run out of money!</li>
</ul><h3>What was the inspiration behind Property Advisor?</h3>
<p>I hope to empower ordinary people with the ability to create financial freedom much earlier in their lives rather than later and to teach and guide people to successfully implement the most powerful business concept on a part time basis in an easy and informative way.</p>
<h3>Property Advisor Features</h3>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>Christopher Cousens</strong></p></div>","An Introduction
Ever thought how you could get involved in one of the most lucrative fields of endeavour, the business which has created many, many ultra wealthy men and women over the years worldwide?
Well, I am a 39 year old guy who's been involved in some interesting international projects from the US, Europe, the Far East and Africa, having run a number of very successful projects from start to finish.
I've always had a plethora of ideas for new ventures, and I've finally decided to bring one to market in an effort to help everyone who's always been interested in property but been too afraid to ask.
It all started when I had a number of retirement policies, policies I've always had questions about. I've always wondered how good they will be 10 or 20 years after I retire. I've always wondered if 75% of my income at retirement will be enough after 30 years have passed. It was because of these questions that I decided to investigate the property market with its residual inflation linked income and, it's because of this that that I've been working for years on Property Advisor as a concept, an idea and a prototype.
I started off creating a spreadsheet with thousands of cells and hundreds of formulas giving me all the information that I wanted. However, it was never really feasible carrying around a pc whenever I went to view a property, so I began thinking that it would be great to have this concept as an app available on an iPad and make it available for the whole world to use.
Well, on to the product I'm trying to fund and I'm holding thumbs for every one of you to help get this out there so we can all get involved in property that much easier.
Property Advisor
Property Advisor is a world first for the iPad market giving you the information to make informed decisions about property investment.
Imagine buying an average house for an average price, in a good area, and only paying 6% of the cost of the house. Would you buy it?
Download Property Advisor to find out how little you'll be paying for a property when you buy-to-let with all the complex calculations and formulas done for you giving you a simple rating at the end. And also, for everyone who wants all the nitty-gritty details, they are all still in there for you.
Retire early, retire strong!
In recent proven statistics, it’s said that even if you manage to save 15% of your gross income for an entire 40 years, it is still not enough to last you in to your 70’s and 80’s. According to the experts in the industry, we should be saving 15% of our gross income for the entire 40 years and, they make assurances that we'll retire happy, wealthy and have more than enough to get through the rest of the years. Even according to their own calculations, your pension will start running short within 5 years even if you cut expenses.
While inflation keeps happening, unless it's truly index-linked, your pension will still keep paying the same and it will eventually be a fraction of what you started out with. 75% Of your salary now won’t be worth much in 10 years when the cost of living doubles and you’re still earning 75% of what you were getting 10 years ago.
It is said that most millionaires have a minimum of seven streams of income and, the best kind is passive income. Property gives you the power to not only create inflation-based revenue streams long after you retire, but to also have an asset at the end of the bond which has been paid off by someone else. Imagine retiring 20 years early, or even 10 years earlier, living off income generated by your properties?
Why property?

Property allows you to generate wealth by means of several income streams.
Even though property is your business, you'll still never have to personally deal with tenants.
Using Property Advisor, you'll be able to quickly, and easily, evaluate any property before buying giving you values such as future return and capital outlay.
Property offers one of the highest returns with the lowest risk of all asset classes.
Income streams from a buy-to-let business are linked to inflation and the chances are that you will never run out of money!
What was the inspiration behind Property Advisor?
I hope to empower ordinary people with the ability to create financial freedom much earlier in their lives rather than later and to teach and guide people to successfully implement the most powerful business concept on a part time basis in an easy and informative way.
Property Advisor Features
You can view all of the screenshots, and the progress for the project, on the Property Advisor Facebook page so please feel free to visit and make as much noise as you'd like!
Overview

View an interactive map showing you of all your properties, opportounities and owned, drawn on a map.
View a scatter chart of your various properties giving you an easier view to determine which ones to focus on and which are the best according to figures and taking the ""feeling"" out of it.

View all of your opportunities at a glance.  This view will show you how much money you would outlay (based on the size of the circle), whether it's a good or bad investment (green, orange or red) and how long it will take for you to break even.  You're also able to click on a circle to go directly to the property.

An easy to see overview of all your opportunities and owned properties.  Just click on a property to go to see the information about that property.
Analyse a property
See just how good a property really is by entering in the figures and watch the graphs move giving you a recommendation as to whether it's a good buy or not.

Capture potential acquisition details and determine the viability for purchase
Capture rental income and expenditure
Capture environmental variables (bond term, bond interest rate, rental escalation, vacancy rate, inflation rate, capital growth)
Calculate Invested vs. Returns
Calculate your breakeven point
Determine capital outlay
Calculates the market value of the property at any given year
View figures on a year by year basis
Monthly and total cash-flow forecasts

Investment indicators shown as graphs from red to green (red being dangerous and green being safe)


Rental - How good is the rental in comparison to your bond?
Rates - How good are your rates in comparison to the price of your property?
Return of Investment - How efficient is your investment?
Internal Rate of Return - Measure the profitability of your investment.
Cashflow - How good or bad is the monthly shortfall?
Invested - How much have you invested yourself?

Breakeven - How long will it take for you to break even and start making a profit?
PA Score - The indicator that sums it all. How good is this investment?



Have a look and see whether the property is a good investment.  With easy to see indicators, all green is always good.  View information from your Cashflow, how much you've Invested, Return on Investment, Internal Rate of Return, when you'll Recoup your money, when you'll Break Even and more.

View information such as your Cashflow over your Bond Period, your Income vs. Expenditure and your Rental Income over the duratin of your bond.

 If you're investing in a few properties, having a map is always handy to help you remember where it is.  

View the list of photos attached to the property.  This will help you remember exactly how to looks.

View the chosen image and flip through them as you would your photos to remind yourself of the property.  You can take the pictures either with the camera on your iPad or attach them from Photos.
Bond optimiser
The bond optimiser will help see how you can optimise your bond and see just how much faster you can clear the loan. See the graphs and charts explaining just how much you'll save with various optimising strategies.

Additional payments - See how additional payments affects your bond.
Maintain initial shortfall - See how you can pay your property off sooner.
Re-invest all surplusses - See how reinvesting all of your additional profit in to the bond affects the length of your bond.

What We Need & What You Get
Although I have my excel spreadsheet, I don't have the expertise to create an iPad application and, although I can make it look like a dog's breakfast, I'd like to have something presentable.
The funding will be going towards one project:

The development itself
I have already done quite a bit of the design and hopefully it's easy to use and intuitive.  If there are any additional funds, I'd like to use them to get the user interface as pristine as possible.  
These are the only two areas in which your contributions will be used.
Who is doing the development?
The company doing the development is a company by the name of Swenggco, a mobile solutions company who is one of the top rated companies on Elance. 
They have done over 100 jobs and have a 4.9/5 rating with absolutely phenomenal reviews and I am so looking forward to working with them.  
The estimated time for completion for Property Advisor is 6-8 weeks.
What happens if I don't reach my goal?
If I don't manage to reach my goal, the first thing I'll do is cut out the UI (User Interface) design and I'll complete the design myself along with the developer. It may not look as amazing as it can or be as usable as it can but I will do my absolute best I can to make it as easy to use as possible.
If I still do not have enough for the development, I'll attempt to get a loan from the bank to fund the remainder to bring Property Advisor to market and make sure that I don't' disappoint my contributors (that's all of you) in giving you your free app.

What is H1?

What is the uniqueness of the technology?
Unlike a traditional LCD projector, H1 uses LED technology. The lifetime of an LED bulb is much longer and is far less likely to overheat than a typical projector bulb. H1 is much smaller and more portable than a traditional projector. Compared to standard Pico projectors that only support 1080p, H1 projects true 1080p physical resolution. H1 also has a higher lumen count than most Pico projectors. H1’s 3D functionality and its vertical and horizontal keystone correction capabilities are more advanced than any other product in this market.


Will there be updates to H1 in the future?
Yes - the Android OS will continue to optimize and update over time.


How does H1 integrate with other connected devices?

What can we expect from XGIMI Assistan app?

How do I set H1 up?
H1 will come with an adapter, designed for H1 use only. Attach the adapter to the bottom of H1 by taking out the 4 screws in the bottom of H1. So H1 can be matched with different stands (X-Floor, X-Wall, etc.)


How do I turn H1 on and off?
Slide the H1's lens cover to turn it on/off or use the remote control to turn it on/off.


How long will H1 last?
Besides the sturdy material of H1's surface, it utilizes a highly efficient LED light source, allowing its projections to stay perfectly crisp, clear and bright for its entire lifespan - up to 10 years, with 8 hours of daily use.


Will H1 come with an international adapter that enables it to work with every standard outlet?
Yes! All H1 orders will include a global power adapter, so customers can travel with H1 all over the world.

</div></div>","BoxKitty is an
amazing cat house that lets you create the purrfect space for your cat, to play
and relax in.
Cats need their own
territory and place to call their own, BoxKitty can be that space, helping them
feel more relaxed, mentally and physically. 
Because of its
clever modular design, BoxKitty can fit into any home, and can be changed at
any time to suit both you and your cat.

BoxKitty lets you  build a cat house
that's right not just for you, but your home and off course your cat too!

And when you feel like a change, it's as easy a
pulling off some tabs, rearranging some pieces and sticking the tabs back on, a
new cat house in minutes!


What Makes
BoxKitty Special?









It's extremely modular: 

The pieces have been uniquely designed to offer the most amount of building and play options, and more are planned for the future, with tunnels, slides and more all possible.







Easy To Make:
 just use the hook and loop tabs to joining the cardboard pieces together. 








BoxKitty is Tough: 
Made of the highest
quality materials, with a specially selected double layered cardboard from New
Zealand. It is much stronger than regular cardboard, as well as being hard to
scratch and water resistant.



Great for your Cat: 

You have your own space, so why not your cat? Cats like to have their own space too, this makes them happier. Cats also need exercise to keep them healthy, both physically and mentally, BoxKitty give's them there own place to play and exercise.



BoxKitty, can change your cats life and maybe your's too: If your cat is happy it will show you more affection, an easy equation; 
HAPPY CAT=HAPPY YOU
Cat's love it, we have been live testing BoxKitty with different cats for months, and if there's one thing we are sure of,
it is cats love to play with it!



Protect your property: A cat with it's own space to relax and play is a happy cat, hopefully by expending it's energy playing in BoxKitty, it will leave some of your more valuable possessions alone.



Safe; the materials in BoxKitty were chosen because they do not contain chemicals that would harm you or your cat.
Perks, or what you actually get:











Why Crowdfunding?

We want to get through to cat lovers the world over and offer it to everyone, Crowdfunding uniquely offers us the chance to reach people on the cat loving internet, both to get us sales and spread the word.


Improve BoxKitty: Your contribution and feedback will help us build new modules, and improve the existing model for cats and cat owners everywhere.每一位的支持可以讓我們開發更多真正適合貓的模具以及堅持耐用無毒的品質。




Final Tooling and Production Run:  We have done all the design and even made lots of prototypes for testing, but now we need the funds to get our final high quality tooling, and materials and start a full production run. We just need to press the BIG RED BUTTON!



Build the Brand: We hope that this campaign will help us build Box Kitty into an international brand, so that we can offer this and future cat products to people all over the world.So please even if you aren't going to buy, feel free to share, and like our campaign, videos, and facebook, after all everyone loves cute cats pics and videos!

Risks
& Challenges
We have worked hard to minimise any risks to you and us, but of course there are always challenges to overcome:


Shipping Costs,
     the biggest issue for us is the simple cost of shipping, international
     shipping is very expensive, that's why we have to charge for it. However
     we are working out ways to overcome these costs, by batching shipments and
     then sending out locally.
Our Cardboard
     is just so tough, unlike other products we are not worried about how
     strong it is, testing has shown it can stand up to plenty of prolonged
     abuse. We have had a few issues cutting it cleanly, even with our
     industrial machinery; some early editions, may have small cosmetic flaws,
     however these do not affect function or lifespan of BoxKitty. We hope to
     have this figured out by the time we ship.",16.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>Welcome to the Ethos Planetware Campaign!</p>
<p>With Planetware, our goal is simple -- to merge smart design with responsible, sustainable production in an everyday product where both are so often overlooked.</p>
<p>Like many big ideas, Planetware was born over a fine meal among friends. In between bites, we were discussing the design philosophy of cradle-to-cradle -- a sustainable model that produces virtually zero waste and is considerate of the next generation. We began to think: Where does this plate come from? What's it made of? What happens when I'm done with it? These are questions we rarely ask.</p>
<p>Then came the proverbial lightbulb moment -- design an everyday product that not only looks great but is also great for the earth. And where better to start than the kitchen table? After all, everybody eats, right?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433878183/fefnyfdu1s86pdy8ppgt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We set out to discover if sustainable tableware already existed and found that while some products were compostable, they were still riddled with chemicals, dyes, and plastics that we did not want <i>anywhere near</i> our food or our communities.</p>
<p>We knew we could do better, so we spent nearly two years developing a line of tableware that is made from natural, sustainable materials and devoid of artificial materials or dyes.</p>
<p>The proud result is Planetware -- a full tableware line of cups, plates and bowls that not only looks good, but you can feel good using. Made of sustainable bamboo, rice husk, and corn bioplastic, it's microwave and dishwasher safe, shatterproof, and free of synthetic dyes and chemicals. Planetware’s slim design is also uniquely stackable, freeing up space in your crowded cabinets. And should you ever throw them away, they're completely compostable, leaving zero impact on the planet.</p>

 Vie Belles Reserve Knife Series      Vie Belles’ Handcrafted Reserve Knife Series are professional quality tools that are stylish as they are functional. In many ways, they are well worth the investment.  


Reminiscent of ancient Samurai swords, each Reserve blade features a gorgeous, hammered finish upon its 67 layers of patterned Damascus.
There is nothing more valuable than being able to purchase a quality product that lasts a lifetime!

 

 
8"" Reserve Chef's Knife
Vie Belles 8"" Reserve Chef's Knife is a well-crafted cutting tool that has been designed to offer the toughness, durability, and aesthetic appeal that your kitchen needs. Behind its beautiful looks is a capable blade that can take care of multiple jobs.
 

 
This breathtaking knife is lightweight, agile, and offers an extremely comfortable grip.

 

 
7"" Reserve Santoku Knife
The Vie Belles’ 7"" Reserve Santoku Knife is a tool that never gets tired. Outside of being a capable implement for dicing, chopping, and slicing of vegetables, the knife is also perfect for cutting boneless meat and fish, thanks to its super sharp edge. Covered in Damascus steel, the blade’s sharp edge holds up for a very long time without getting blunt.
 
 
 This beautiful, Asian-inspired chef knife is by far one of the most versatile cutting tools money can buy. At its most basic, it does everything a Santoku knife should; it makes light work of all cutting tasks.

 

 
5.5-inches Nakiri Knife
If finishing details and handle shape are essential to you, then you shouldn’t look past Vie Belles’ 5.5-inches Nakiri Knife. The knife is versatile enough to let you cut vegetables of all shapes and sizes.
 
 Nakiri is a Japanese word for ""vegetable knife."" When it comes to preparing salad slicing vegetables for stir-fry, you won’t find better than the Nakiri knife.

 

 
10"" Reserve Bread Knife
Lightweight and easy-to-use serrated bread knives won’t come greater than Vie Belles’ 10"" Reserve Bread Knife. The knife is an excellent workhouse to have in your kitchen thanks to its versatile, surprisingly light, and easy-to-control nature. While bread knives can be hard to re-sharpen, the quality of the material and toughness of Vie Belles’ bread knife means you are dealing with a tool that will give you a very long useful lifespan.
 
 
 
If you bake or buy whole loaves of bread, then you will need a bread knife in your kitchen.

 
5.5"" Reserve Utility Knife
Besides adding beauty to your kitchen, Vie Belles’ 5.5"" Reserve Utility Knife offers convenience and practicality in more ways than can be imagined. Its sturdy build is made to last, while the knife’s sharp edge is intended to provide you with all the cutting power you need to handle the rigours of the job.
 
 It's perfect for a multitude of small tasks where more precise cuts are needed, such as trimming broccoli, green beans, or other smaller vegetables.

<p>If you're a friend or family member visiting this page, you probably already know how long of an undertaking this project has been. If you're visiting just because...well...thank you! Here's a quick backstory for you. I started Hammocks &amp; High Tea as an homage to my grandmother and my upbringing in South America. For as long as I can remember I have been enamored with design, and after studying the markets &amp; trends for some time, I realized there was room to bring a new sense of color and pattern to modern homes. I started this collection in 2007 as a stationery line, producing cards from a tiny room in my Brooklyn apartment. In 2008 I launched a few textiles &amp; gift products to test the market and was blown away by the reaction I received. In short, Lucky magazine, Instyle, and the Today show liked the product and suddenly I was in business. I have been expanding ever since and 2011 heralds the biggest growth spurt for my little company. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hammocks &amp; High Tea is an environmentally conscious company from the printing of our fabrics (water based, no VOC inks) to the production of our collection (local, and made to order to minimize any waste). I aim to grow this collection in the ""slow and steady"" manner, producing quality products in limited quantities. In January I will exhibit at my first of many major tradeshows, awe heck...the mother of all tradeshows...the New York International Gift Fair! This past year Hammocks &amp; High Tea has been embraced by major publications such as Elle Decor, House Beautiful, Coastal Living, Women's Health, etc. The Spring 2011 collection has already been received with such enthusiasm that I am still pinching myself. </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>How you can help</h4>
<p>There are two ways sales happen in design: direct sales online and wholesale. The wholesale market is where I will be making my first major foray this year, hence the International Gift Fair. Hammocks &amp; High Tea is already sold at a limited number of retailers in the US and nationwide, but in order to grow I must expand my distribution. At a wholesale show the buyer (store owner) places an order for the collection and products must be made, and ready to ship, before payment is received. This causes a common stagger in funds as cash gets tied up in producing the collection. In this case, I am using campaign funds to ready my fabric (as well as a small portion for materials I will need before the show) in order to produce and ship quickly. Below is a breakdown of how funds will be distributed in order to get us rolling on the first round of production.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Purchase of fabric for sample making and production- $4000</p>
<p>Production of samples for sales reps- $1000</p>
<p>Catalog photography &amp; design for distribution- $1500</p>

If you're a friend or family member visiting this page, you probably already know how long of an undertaking this project has been. If you're visiting just because...well...thank you! Here's a quick backstory for you. I started Hammocks & High Tea as an homage to my grandmother and my upbringing in South America. For as long as I can remember I have been enamored with design, and after studying the markets & trends for some time, I realized there was room to bring a new sense of color and pattern to modern homes. I started this collection in 2007 as a stationery line, producing cards from a tiny room in my Brooklyn apartment. In 2008 I launched a few textiles & gift products to test the market and was blown away by the reaction I received. In short, Lucky magazine, Instyle, and the Today show liked the product and suddenly I was in business. I have been expanding ever since and 2011 heralds the biggest growth spurt for my little company. 
 
Hammocks & High Tea is an environmentally conscious company from the printing of our fabrics (water based, no VOC inks) to the production of our collection (local, and made to order to minimize any waste). I aim to grow this collection in the ""slow and steady"" manner, producing quality products in limited quantities. In January I will exhibit at my first of many major tradeshows, awe heck...the mother of all tradeshows...the New York International Gift Fair! This past year Hammocks & High Tea has been embraced by major publications such as Elle Decor, House Beautiful, Coastal Living, Women's Health, etc. The Spring 2011 collection has already been received with such enthusiasm that I am still pinching myself. 
 
How you can help
There are two ways sales happen in design: direct sales online and wholesale. The wholesale market is where I will be making my first major foray this year, hence the International Gift Fair. Hammocks & High Tea is already sold at a limited number of retailers in the US and nationwide, but in order to grow I must expand my distribution. At a wholesale show the buyer (store owner) places an order for the collection and products must be made, and ready to ship, before payment is received. This causes a common stagger in funds as cash gets tied up in producing the collection. In this case, I am using campaign funds to ready my fabric (as well as a small portion for materials I will need before the show) in order to produce and ship quickly. Below is a breakdown of how funds will be distributed in order to get us rolling on the first round of production.
 
Purchase of fabric for sample making and production- $4000
Production of samples for sales reps- $1000
Catalog photography & design for distribution- $1500
Booth fee- $500
 
Income at the time is approximately 90% online sales and 10% wholesale, and I'm happy to say that the company has doubled sales in 2010 and expect to triple sales in 2011. We are completely self funded, single owned and run, and at this time put all income back into our production & marketing efforts.

<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>1) Why two products?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We realized we can make you save by offering you a non magnet version of the Sky Shelves "" Simply Shelves.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">For example, in your kitchen cupboards; if you are using a one level shelf, you do not need the magnets.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">If you have many combinations, a good way to reduce cost is to have your highest level a non magnetic board.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">However, we always recommend the ""Magnetize Me"" option since it is most versatile for future use.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>2)  Which package should I get?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">That is a very good question. It all depends on the space and items you have. You can always email us  <strong>support@skyshelves.com</strong> for us to help you pick the best package for you.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>3) What makes this product different?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">1 - You can customize your shelves to fit your space and your needs. Not Just your present space and need but your future one as well!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">2 - The greatest part of it is that you do not need any screws or any tools.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">3- In the future, your needs and spaces will probably change and we are aware of that. That is what makes this product a long term keeper for you. You can simply redesign your shelves just for a change, for a different mood, for a different practical setup or when you get new products to fit just right! </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">4- It looks great in any place of the house. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">All of the above and more are reasons you will enjoy your return on investment with the Sky Shelves. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>4) Will the magnets interfere with my electronic device?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">No they should not. The magnet strength required to damage modern devices is extremely more powerful than the one we use.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Neodymium magnets are now found in computer hard drives, headphones, compact high-force magnetic assemblies and Halbach arrays. They are also used in medical equipment, such as magnetic resonance imagers, and acoustics.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">However, it is best to do your own research. We do not want to be responsible for anything. If still in doubt, opt for the Simply Shelves which do not have magnets.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>5) Will the magnets lose their strength?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The lifetime of these magnets is permanent. They begin to lose their magnetism at temperatures above 80 degrees Celsius, so they are not suited to high-temperature applications. Room temperature is ideal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We deal with ISO-9000 and ISO-9001 factories across the world to get you the best product out there.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>6) Why crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Crowdfunding is a good way to raise money to go into mass production and to showcase our product to the world. In return, we offer discounted rates for our early supporters who are helping us give birth to this innovation and who believe in us.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>7) Customs and duties for international order</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Our prices do not include VAT or other country taxes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">As many of you know, our terms of sale are CIF destination. This means that we pay all freight, but none of the duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and tax for each location through Indiegogo</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>8) Will the shipping cost be adjusted if more than one perk is purchased?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">At the moment, the shipping cost is per item per weight but we hope to renegotiate these fees with a larger volume (larger contributions) and reward our backers afterwards. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>9) When do we choose colors?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We will send you an email at the end of our campaign confirming your order and you’ll be able to tell us which color is your favorite. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>10) Will you have your own site for support and for purchasing more packages? </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yes we will! However, the best time to back us is now! Once the campaign will be completed, we will enter InDemand mode from Indiegogo. We will also in parallel launch our website, where you will be able to purchase in the future directly from us. At that point the prices will reflect more our MRSP. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>11) What material are used to make the boards and why?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene .</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Some of the key properties; very sturdy and hard, long-life span and higher melting point.  ABS is widely used for purposes ranging from musical instruments, golf-clubs,  machine parts, car bumpers, toys, motorcycle helmets and so on.</p>

   ANYWHERE WHICH MAKES YOUR LIFE EASIER 



 

 
 

STEP 1
Just insert the legs into each other until desired height. Then, insert a shoe on the bottom leg.


STEP 2
Now, insert legs into boards. Please note – adjacent boards can share legs to maximize space.

 
STEP 3
Then, place boards in the combination desired. Create any combination you want.
Infinite possible combinations 






 


 
 
Your Space. Your Design.
 

 




 

Simply Shelves is ideal for one level shelves (for example to use in cupboards) and can also be combined with the Magnetize-Me option for a more cost-efficient solution.
Magnetize me has magnets integrated  inside the product to enhance the sky shelves experience by providing multi-level shelving stability and rigidity through magnetic fields while remaining completely free of screws and tools.
Magnetize Me is the complete Sky Shelves experience giving you unlimited range and combination possibilities today and in the future when you decide to purchase more boxes or product lines.
*Please note if you choose the Magnetize Me option: the shoes of each column and the corners of each board will activate a magnetic field to provide a stable, strong multi-leveled shelf.

 



 




After extensive testing and sourcing the best materials we could find, we are ready for large-scale production.
Below, you can see some pictures of the mold we’re using to create Sky Shelves


 

 



Meet the Sky Shelves team! We are a bunch of cool and hard working people, just like you. We’re based in Laval, Quebec in Canada and are proud to say we’re surrounded with a great board and a fantastic team.
The innovative idea all started when  we moved into our new home. There was so much space not being utilized properly.  There was a need for more space and organization in many areas in our home and office.
However, present solutions just did not fit our particular needs. That is when we said ""Why doesn't someone make a customizable, adaptable and easy to use shelving solution.""
That is when Sky Shelves was born.
Once we received our first prototypes, we wanted to use them everywhere; the office, the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, counter spaces,  the bathroom and more places.
 


The Reason
EVER WISHED YOU HAD JUST A LITTLE MORE SPACE AT HOME/OFFICE?

TIRED OF SCREWS AND TOOL?
We understand that with time your space and storage needs are forever changing. We also understand how annoying screws and tools can be. 


Now, what if you can redesign your space infinitely without any tools or screws? 

The existing nightmares: 
Inflexible and non adaptable designs, the loose screws, damaged pressed woods/soft woods, fear from water absorption, chipped corners, peeling design, the fear of the shelves falling due to its gradual declination and so on... 
One Purpose Only
Most products out there only serve one purpose and are meant for only one place in your home for their entire life span! What a waste of money.
How about relocating one of these existing solutions? 
Most products when mounted will most likely fall apart if dismounted.
How about personalizing one of these existing solutions?
Just Impossible!
That is how we felt about all that wasted space!
 
 

Our word means the world to us.If despite our planning, under some rare circumstances out of our control, our delivery deadline wouldn’t be met – we promise to be transparent with our backers and keep you in the loop every step of the way.Rest assured, we will keep all our promises and deliver.

We spent nearly 3 amazing years there, building our life in Ottawa. We chose to be married in Ottawa, among our family and friends, because Ottawa is where our relationship developed, and our love, dreams, and life goals were firmly established. <br/><br/>2 years ago this October, Blue and I left Canada and end up on a very unexpected 18+ month journey through 5 countries, in order to immigrate to the U.S. It was a very tumultuous and emotionally exhausting time in our lives, and it took a serious toll on our relationship, especially because of the simple fact that we were essentially forced to leave the one place we both called and still, to this day, call home - Ottawa. I cannot express how much I have continuously grieved over leaving our life, our friends, our family, our security, behind, when we said goodbye to Canada. And though Blue does not wear his emotions on his sleeve, I feel he is on the same page as me. He misses his people, just as I do. <br/><br/> In January of this year, Blue and I were granted entry, together, into the U.S., and we arrived to Austin, TX on the 29th. Our time here has been very beneficial and we are both now working and establishing ourselves in the states. We are so grateful to have finally been given the chance to settle down again. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, after immigration forms, fees, visas, travel expenses, living expenses, and many many surprise expenses, by the time we made it to the U.S., we had run through any type of savings we had been preparing in order to start our new life in this new country, and that has made us very dependent on outside assistance.  On this journey over the last two years,  We have both had an amazing support system from our family and friends all over the world, especially my father, Nasri, who has generously offered his support to help Blue and I on this very long immigration path to the United States.  I could not have asked for a more supportive, understanding, and loving father, and I honestly don't think I could have done all of this without him. Thank you dad.<br/><br/>This campaign is not essential, and by that, I mean, Blue and I will be ok if we do not make it to Canada for a visit home at this time. But I know, in the bottom of my heart, that being among friends and family, surrounded by beautiful memories, music, and wonderful and fulfilling conversation, we both might, for the first time in a very long time, feel a sense of peace and calm. I know that we both need a chance to heal from our experiences over these past two years, and what better time to do that than for our second wedding anniversary?<br/><br/>Blue and I have both been working very hard since we arrived to Austin, and we are starting to make our own living, slowly but surly. Blue was just hired at Guitar Center (ATX) as a professional audio sales associate, and I was hired, in February, as the lead female singer for a party band company, Stargazer Production, LLC, forming a new band to market. Unfortunately, I was put out of commission on June 20, just a short time ago, halting all of my work for 6-8 weeks, after a brick fell on my foot at a venue and shattered my second toe on my right foot. I am still able to perform as a solo act, sitting down, but this unexpected and unfortunate incident has slowed down my work to almost a full stop. I am gracefully rocking crutches like a pro until further notice! Regardless of this setback, we expect that in the next 6 months, we will no longer need support from family in order to compensate for bills and expenses. We are in a country with many opportunities and we are trying to utilize its benefits and live well! <br/><br/>Your donations to this campaign will be funding:<br/><br/>1) Two round trip tickets from Austin, TX, to Ottawa, ON, (8-10 day trip)</p><p>2) Food/Lodging/Transportation Expenses for the entire trip</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">3) Payment of Fees for indigogo campaign site use</span></p><p>4) Possibly, but not likely, a little bit of extra Cash to compensate for the time off work, in order to make the trip, for both Blue and me<br/><br/>I know this is a lot of money to ask for, and don't worry!

And to our entire Canadian family, one way or another, we are getting up there to see you all, as We both have about 30+ people who each need huge hugs and kisses for about an hour each!

<h2><b>THE PROBLEM </b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Your house is filled with trillions of microscopic life forms, called dust mites, that feed off your dead skin cells. Dust mites are nearly everywhere. The harmful allergen they create comes from their fecal pellets and body fragments.       </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433221350/r63mkckacrgqkxldojma.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>MYTH:</b> Just washing your bed sheets is enough to prevent dust mites.</p>
<p><b>MORE FACTS:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Your body sheds about 40,000 skin cells every hour.</li>
<li>Over a 24 hour period, you'll lose about a million skin cells.</li>
<li>In one year, you'll shed more than 8 pounds of dead skin cells!</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>WHERE DO THEY ALL GO?</b></h4>
<p>The dust that collects on your tables, TVs, windowsills and on those picture frames are mostly made up of dead skin cells. In fact, about 80% of the material seen floating in a sunbeam in your house are actually dead skin cells.</p>
<p></p>

<h3><b>PHILIPS UV-C STERILIZING LAMP</b></h3></b></h3>
<p>Similar to sunlight, Atocare uses an ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light reduces dust mites &amp; bed bugs by damaging their nucleic acid, or DNA, thereby destroying their ability to multiply. This is a safer way to sterilize your bed without the use of harsh chemicals.</p>
<p>UV light treatment is used in a variety of applications such as food, air and water purification, because it kills 99.8% of dangerous germs (<i>e.coli, salmonella, staph</i>).</p>
<p>Each unit is also equipped with a safety ""<i>distance control sensor</i>"" - this means that when the vacuum is lifted 1-inch from a surface, the sensor will automatically shut-off the UV light. The lamp can be controlled manually as well.</p>

</h4>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">After years of prototyping, developing, refinement and adding many features, we began manufacturing in Korea and distributing on a small scale in Asia. We are asking for your support to help us develop a new model that will be compatible for North America and other select countries.  We hope to reach out to more people and raise awareness of how important it is to keep our sleeping environment clean.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Your contribution can help our company move forward and introduce Atocare to a global community and especially to those who can benefit from it the most.

<p>We represent one of many small companies in South Korea that dream of promoting their products &amp; creations to a global community, but lack the marketing budget or the manpower to do it through traditional methods.  As a start-up or small company, the global retail environment is very brutal and risky, let alone the language &amp; cultural barriers. </p>
<p>Crowdfunding is still a very new concept in Korea, but represents a new hope in today's marketing for start-ups and small companies like us to reach out to a global community to tell their story &amp; raise funds for their projects. A successful campaign would enable us to not only launch a new model here on Indiegogo, but would also raise awareness of crowdfunding in Korea. Through increased awareness, more innovative creators, small companies and start-ups may gain hope to reach out to people for funding outside of their current small networks. And the global community will get to see the dynamic innovations from Korea, one of the most advanced technological countries in the world. There are so many innovative and beneficial products that just stay in Korea and never get a chance to shine.</p>
<p>Start-ups and small businesses are supported by the Korean government through various organizations that are always searching for new ways to help companies like us. A successful campaign would enable us to employ the strength of these organizations and influence them to take notice of the benefits of crowdfunding and get them to assist other companies in various ways, including cultural and communication barriers as well as marketing.</p>
<p>So our goal is to not only introduce Atocare to you, but also in the long-run, you to the thousands of Korean creators and developers and give them new possibilities and hope for their efforts through our campaign and Indiegogo!  </p>

<h3>THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS</h3>
<h3><b style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">PATENTED NOISE REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial; font-weight: normal;"">Packing such a powerful motor in a compact and portable case was an extremely challenging step in the development process.  When we started initial designs, we encountered some obstacles, such as noise.  With a smaller case design, came less room to create sound barriers and with a powerful motor, the noise was an issue.</span></p>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Many vacuums that house powerful motors tend to give off a ""shrill"" noise. To overcome this obstacle, we researched different types of materials and eventually developed our own in-house technology to combat the noise. The result gave us more a ""muted"" sound at only 70db with no shrill or unpleasant feeling. We have patented this technology and have received an award of recognition for it as well from the Korean government. It has allowed us to put a powerful motor in a compact case without compromising power.</span></div>

THE PROBLEM 

Your house is filled with trillions of microscopic life forms, called dust mites, that feed off your dead skin cells. Dust mites are nearly everywhere. The harmful allergen they create comes from their fecal pellets and body fragments.       


MYTH: Just washing your bed sheets is enough to prevent dust mites.
MORE FACTS:

Your body sheds about 40,000 skin cells every hour.
Over a 24 hour period, you'll lose about a million skin cells.
In one year, you'll shed more than 8 pounds of dead skin cells!



WHERE DO THEY ALL GO?
The dust that collects on your tables, TVs, windowsills and on those picture frames are mostly made up of dead skin cells. In fact, about 80% of the material seen floating in a sunbeam in your house are actually dead skin cells.



OUR MISSION
We're on a mission to rid the world of dust mites and desperately need your support to win this battle!
To arm you, we've created the worlds most advanced & most powerful portable bed vacuum that incorporates a simple, ergonomic design with great functionality and is very sturdy...like one user said, ""it's the BMW of bed-vacs!""  Now we need your voice to get the word out and your contribution to win the war.

                            
""Ato"" refers to ""Atopic"" Dermatitis - an itchy skin condition influenced by dust and dust mites.  Several close family members of our Atocare team as well as many others in this world suffer from this, so we were driven to develop Atocare in an effort to eradicate many of those causes, because we know how you feel!
That's why we are proud to introduce the ultimate bed-vac and want to reach out and help others always keep their beds clean & fresh.  Atocare will give you peace of mind when you sleep and we all know how important that is. 
Atocare is simply the best and we stand by that.  But don't take it from us, see what some of our actual users had to say...  





Simply the best bed-vac today, don't settle for anything less...your bed is too important to neglect!


 We spend about a third of our                     lives in bed.


      

                     Don't you think you should be cleaning it?


 


Meet ATOCARE, designed to clean your bed...really good!








Every home should have one, period. How are you cleaning your mattress and bed now...or are you?

BALANCED & LIGHTWEIGHT: Only 5 lbs and ergonomically designed so arms don't get tired.

SIMPLE DESIGN: We designed Atocare with simplicity, functionality, safety and ease-of-use, but most of all ultimate suction power in mind.

*600-watt vacuum motor / 50-watt brush motor


""Powerful suction is the most effective way to      reduce house dust allergens in the mattress...""  

                                                                - Dyson




 

THE ATOCARE DIFFERENCE




Dust mites are so small, they are undetectable to the naked eye...


  
If neglected, your mattress can become a virtual breeding ground for dust mites and bed bugs! 


THE SOLUTION


             

INCREDIBLE SUCTION POWER


At the end of the day, nothing beats pure suction power to get dust mites. Atocare has many features, but we focused on suction power as a focal point to our design. 
650 watts makes this an extremely powerful bed vac - only bigger vacuums are this powerful. The powered suction reaches deep into the bedding to remove dust, dust mites and bacteria. Atocare has a suction power performance rating of 40 litres per second, which makes it the most powerful in its class.



 

PHILIPS UV-C STERILIZING LAMP
Similar to sunlight, Atocare uses an ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light reduces dust mites & bed bugs by damaging their nucleic acid, or DNA, thereby destroying their ability to multiply. This is a safer way to sterilize your bed without the use of harsh chemicals.
UV light treatment is used in a variety of applications such as food, air and water purification, because it kills 99.8% of dangerous germs (e.coli, salmonella, staph).
Each unit is also equipped with a safety ""distance control sensor"" - this means that when the vacuum is lifted 1-inch from a surface, the sensor will automatically shut-off the UV light. The lamp can be controlled manually as well.
             Flat-bottom design glides over fabric and mattresses ""like an iron""

            
  



DETACHABLE SUB-HOSE
Atocare comes equipped with a sub-hose for hard to get places.  It can also be used to ""self-clean"" the bottom of the vacuum after use.

                         
TESTED BY INDEPENDENT LABS
Atocare has been tested and approved by independent labs for effectively reducing dust and allergens in the environment...
     
...by cleaning deep inside mattresses and other fabric furniture!
      
      

TRUE HEPA FILTER
To meet US government standards, a HEPA filter must remove 99.97% of all particles.  For a HEPA filter in a vacuum cleaner to be effective, the vacuum cleaner must be designed so that all the air drawn into the machine is expelled through the filter, with none of the air leaking past it.  This is often referred to as ""Sealed HEPA"" or ""True HEPA"".  

                  

Atocare uses a ""True HEPA"" filter with a filtration rating of 99.97% of anything bigger than 0.2 microns, which is among the best filter ratings.


                              



EASY TO CLEAN
We designed Atocare to be powerful, but also easy to clean and maintain. The large 570cc canister is big enough for long cleaning jobs and since it is clear and attached on the outside, you can easily see when to empty it. 


 Just twist-off and rinse!
 

CYCLONE SYSTEMA cyclone system removes and separates dust and other particles from the air stream. Dirty air enters a conical container where it flows in a tight spiral. Centrifugal force throws the particles out of the airflow onto the wall of the container, from which they fall into a bin.
 


EXPELS CLEAN AIR
We employed several stages of cyclones so that the air that is expelled is perfectly clean, odorless, and free of any dust or allergens. We also designed the flow of air to blow 45 degrees out and up. This prevents air from not blowing down to create more dust or blow uncomfortably in your face as you clean.


                      



PERKS...THANK YOU!
NOTE:  This model is an Indiegogo exclusive.  This campaign is your ONLY chance to pre-claim this model - get the best bed-vac in the world now!

WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT



ABOUT US

After years of prototyping, developing, refinement and adding many features, we began manufacturing in Korea and distributing on a small scale in Asia. We are asking for your support to help us develop a new model that will be compatible for North America and other select countries.  We hope to reach out to more people and raise awareness of how important it is to keep our sleeping environment clean.
Your contribution can help our company move forward and introduce Atocare to a global community and especially to those who can benefit from it the most. Indiegogo provides a great way for us to reach out to real people, but all with common needs.      

OUR VISION       

We represent one of many small companies in South Korea that dream of promoting their products & creations to a global community, but lack the marketing budget or the manpower to do it through traditional methods.  As a start-up or small company, the global retail environment is very brutal and risky, let alone the language & cultural barriers. 
Crowdfunding is still a very new concept in Korea, but represents a new hope in today's marketing for start-ups and small companies like us to reach out to a global community to tell their story & raise funds for their projects. A successful campaign would enable us to not only launch a new model here on Indiegogo, but would also raise awareness of crowdfunding in Korea. Through increased awareness, more innovative creators, small companies and start-ups may gain hope to reach out to people for funding outside of their current small networks. And the global community will get to see the dynamic innovations from Korea, one of the most advanced technological countries in the world. There are so many innovative and beneficial products that just stay in Korea and never get a chance to shine.
Start-ups and small businesses are supported by the Korean government through various organizations that are always searching for new ways to help companies like us. A successful campaign would enable us to employ the strength of these organizations and influence them to take notice of the benefits of crowdfunding and get them to assist other companies in various ways, including cultural and communication barriers as well as marketing.
So our goal is to not only introduce Atocare to you, but also in the long-run, you to the thousands of Korean creators and developers and give them new possibilities and hope for their efforts through our campaign and Indiegogo!  



                      
THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
PATENTED NOISE REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY
Packing such a powerful motor in a compact and portable case was an extremely challenging step in the development process.  When we started initial designs, we encountered some obstacles, such as noise.  With a smaller case design, came less room to create sound barriers and with a powerful motor, the noise was an issue.
Many vacuums that house powerful motors tend to give off a ""shrill"" noise. To overcome this obstacle, we researched different types of materials and eventually developed our own in-house technology to combat the noise.

We have patented this technology and have received an award of recognition for it as well from the Korean government. It has allowed us to put a powerful motor in a compact case without compromising power.

HELP US TO HELP YOU
We hope that through this campaign, we can exceed basic funding goals to reach stretch goals that would allow us to further our research & development and continually improve upon what we have created.

THE SIMPLE, BEAUTIFUL, CONNECTEDTHERMOSTAT

AS SEEN ON







































THE IDEA


Most home thermostats are either extremely unattractive, or too complicated and loaded with features that you don’t really use.
Zen is a new home thermostat that looks beautiful on your wall, is incredibly simple to use and allows you to control the temperature of your home from anywhere using your smartphone.








BEAUTIFUL





Zen fits beautifully into your home or office environment. 
The
LED screen provides clear and simple feedback, icons only display when they are
required.
Available in black or white, Zen blends seamlessly into your existing interior design.












SIMPLE


Comfort doesn't have to be complicated.
Thats why we've designed Zen and the smartphone app to make it easy to stay in control of your home heating and cooling.







TOUCH SCREEN INTERACTION



• WAKE UP
Touch ZEN to wake the display.
• SET THE MODE
The left and right arrows allow you to switch between heating, cooling and controlling the fan.
• SET THE TEMPERATURE
Use the up and down arrows to set the temperature.
• FADE
Once you are done, the display fades, but ZEN keeps working in the background.











SET THE TEMPERATURE WHEREVER YOU ARE



Zen allows you to control the temperature of your home anytime, from anywhere, by using our smartphone app.
Our phone app provides you with convenient functionality including: 

• REMOTE CONTROL
Set the temperature of your home anytime from anywhere.
• ZONES
Manage multiple thermostats in your home.
• SCHEDULES
Set up a schedule to match your routines.
• PRESETS
Create and modify presets for your ZEN.




ZEN FOCUSES ON WHAT REALLY MATTERS,
MAKING YOUR HOME COMFORTABLE
 ""We looked at how people use thermostats and we found that complicated units with embedded learning algorithms don’t really work the way people expect. You can spend a lot of time correcting the assumptions it’s made about you. We wanted to avoid this. We didn’t want to create a thermostat that thinks it’s smarter than you. We wanted you to only interact with Zen when you really need to.""













CONNECTED


ZEN CAN WORK AS A STAND ALONE UNITOR WITH YOUR EXISTING HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM.
Zen is designed to be an open system using Wi‐Fi or ZigBee. It will work with smart home systems like Apple HomeKit and, once OpenHome Certified, it will work seamlessly with other OpenHome devices.  This allows home owners to access scheduling and energy saving apps if they choose. 











MULTIPLE THERMOSTATS?


No problem - You can connect up to 5 Zen WiFi thermostats on your home network, giving you the control you need over the temperature in all parts of your home. 

Check out our perks for ways to get Zen and support our team.
If you like what we are doing but are unable to contribute, it would be great if you could share this campaign and help spread the word.





INTERACTIVE 3D MODEL






INSTALLATION


INSTALLATION IS SIMPLE TOO
ZEN comes complete with everything you need in the box. Our interactive installation guide generates a personalized set of installation and wiring instructions.
If you’re not comfortable installing ZEN yourself, we’ve made it easy for your HVAC contractor to get you up and running quickly too.












MAGNETS FOR
EASY ATTACHMENT

ZEN uses a patented magnet mounting system that makes it easy to click it on and off the wall.

We will be  OpenHome certified which means Zen will work with the IControl platform used by leading US retailers and cable providers. We are also working to add compatibility with other platforms, including Apple Homekit, SmartThings and Revolv.
Can I use the Zen thermostat if I don’t have an existing home automation system?
Yes. Zen also comes in a WiFi version, which connects to your home WiFi network using a small bridge which plugs into any wall power outlet (it’s about the size of a phone charger). This means you can use the Zen app to control the thermostat from your smartphone without needing a home automation system. Alternatively if you just want a beautiful thermostat you can use your new Zen thermostat the same way you use your existing one.
Do I need a professional installer to setup my Zen thermostat?
In most regions a professional installer is not required to setup your Zen thermostat, however it is recommended.
What heating and cooling systems is the Zen thermostat compatible with?
The Zen thermostat is a compatible replacement for most existing 24VAC thermostats. Check out our section on Technical Specifications, or use the configuration website (www.zenthermostat.com/install) or contact us if you are unsure. 
When you select one of our perks, we will get in touch with you to get your specific details so you can be confident Zen will work in your home when you get it. 
What is the power source for the Zen thermostat?
The Zen thermostat can be powered permanently when a “C” wire is in place on your current system. Don’t worry, if your home doesn’t have this, Zen has 4 AA batteries which keep it powered. In typical usage patterns the Zen thermostat's batteries will last approximately two years.
What smartphone platforms is the Zen compatible with?
The Zen smartphone app runs on both iOS and Android platforms. 
Can I schedule Zen to turn on my heating or cooling system?
Yes. We’ve created a simple user interface for scheduling, so you can program your system from anywhere using the Zen smartphone app. If you are connecting to an existing home automation platform you can use their scheduling or remote access apps. 
Are there any on-going fees for using the Zen app?
No, there are no on-going fees for using the Zen app. 
How much does shipping cost?
Shipping costs are included in the perk prices. We will ship anywhere around the world.",75.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>Don't miss all the party while you sweat away in your hot kitchen and don't keep your friends hungry. Nothing kills the mood faster than hungry guests. </p>
<p>With IRONATE you can make a pizza in just 3 minutes, so you will actually be able to enjoy your party. And you can keep them coming – a different pizza with different toppings every few minutes.</p>

<p>We love to cook and experiment with all kinds of dough and toppings. We love using sour dough and organic, homegrown toppings for our pies. </p>
<p>But there are times when you just want a pizza and don't have the time to mess with the dough. </p>
<p>That's why IRONATE is designed for a standard 10"" pizza from your local supermarket freezer. </p>

<p>And what a frozen pizza it is. High cooking temperature and shorter baking time can turn even a bland, frozen pizza into the star of your party. The crust won't get all hard and crumbly like it does after 10, 15 minutes in an oven.  </p>
<p>You can add just a few leaves of fresh basil or some fresh mozzarella and your friends won't believe you didn't make that pie all by yourself.</p>

<p>You can use it on most heat sources in most conditions. It can make a great pizza indoors, using only your glass cooktop or gas burner. </p>

<p>At IRONATE we want to learn from our past. Cast iron and carbon steel cookware was used for generations and generations and for a good reason. </p>
<p>It's much more durable than modern, thin Teflon pans and can hold much more energy. That really helps with cooking.</p>
<p>When developing IRONATE, we wanted to use that age-old technology but add something to it. We researched all the available materials and manufacturing techniques and IRONATE was born.</p>
<div data-id=""13789676""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1477078761/laeoiqqp84ywhpz35vdh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>In the process of making a pizza-making gadget, we developed a piece of cookware that can really do anything and will last a lifetime. </p>
<p>It's can withstand high temperatures and doesn't cool down much, when you put food in it, so it's perfect for searing those sous vide steaks, giving them a nice crust on the outside. </p>
<p>You can use it to make vegetables. Just close the hot lid for a few minutes to cook them and then crank up the heat to add some color. </p>
<p>Even the lid has a few tricks up its sleeve. If you’ve ever wanted to bake your pizza in an oven, you can use it instead of baking stones or steels and save up to $90.</p>
<div data-id=""13789684""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1477078761/g9pcrwiiohcbsf8locpk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<p>It can also be used to keep your food warm for up to an hour. Just flip it around and serve your dinner on the plate. IRONATE doesn't use coating, so you won't damage the lid when cutting or using metal cutlery on it.</p>

<p>When designing new products, we look in the past for inspiration, but design for the future.</p>
<p>That's why you won't find a single piece of artificial material in our product, even the box that IRONATE comes in is wooden. And there is no built-in planned obsolescence. IRONATE is designed to last for generations.</p>
<p>The bulk of IRONATE is made out of carbon steel, hand welded together for ultimate durability. It's coated and seasoned with vegetable oil, that's all the rust protection you will ever need and it provides a great low-stick surface.</p>

<p>Those cool handles are made out of locally sourced oak or beech wood that can stand the test of time. Even the packaging is handmade out of untreated softwood boards.</p>
<p>We don't use artificial printing ink anywhere on IRONATE. All the logos and insignia are laser engraved into the material.</p>

<p>IRONATE comes with cool wooden handles that protect you from hot metal. They can be easily removed for easy cleaning or use in an oven or on open fire.</p>
<p>All handles are laser engraved with IRONATE logo. But our friends told us that IRONATE would make a perfect gift for special occasions like weddings, housewarming parties and birthdays.</p>
<p>So we decided to offer you, our Kickstarter backers, an option to choose a custom engraved handles. You can put anything you want on those handles (within reason).</p>

<p>Shorter pre-heating times and shorter baking times means that you will be able to enjoy the party with your guests, instead of waiting and sweating in your kitchen.</p>
<p>But it also means that you can save money and energy.</p>
<p>Faster pre-heat and cooking times mean less energy spent. That can translate into less dollars spent and your apartment will not turn into a sauna every time you make a pizza.</p>
<p>You will also save money on cookware. IRONATE is durable and made to last a lifetime, so it can be the only one you will ever buy.</p>
<p>Just think about all those cheap, thin pans you bought over the years. Sure, they are only $19,99 but it adds up if you have to buy a new one every few months.</p>

<p>Steel is a perfect material for cookware. It really is. Cleaning IRONATE is a breeze. You can put it in a dishwasher or clean it with warm soapy water. As long as you don't leave it wet for long periods of time, it's natural oil coating will prevent it from rusting.</p>
<p>It doesn't need any special maintenance either. Just add a few drops of oil now and then and it will reinforce its seasoning every time you use it.</p>

But there are times when you just want a pizza and don't have the time to mess with the dough. 
That's why IRONATE is designed for a standard 10"" pizza from your local supermarket freezer. 

And what a frozen pizza it is. High cooking temperature and shorter baking time can turn even a bland, frozen pizza into the star of your party. The crust won't get all hard and crumbly like it does after 10, 15 minutes in an oven.  
You can add just a few leaves of fresh basil or some fresh mozzarella and your friends won't believe you didn't make that pie all by yourself.

IRONATE is made out of heavy duty carbon steel that prevents wrapping and has the perfect thermal properties for cooking. It has even better heat capacity than cast iron. 

You can use it on most heat sources in most conditions. It can make a great pizza indoors, using only your glass cooktop or gas burner. 
But it can also be used on an open fire or as a separate container on your grill. You can easily remove those cool wooden handles, cover the whole IRONATE with hot coals and use it as a bell for authentic Mediterranean feel.

 
 
 
 

 
 
At IRONATE we want to learn from our past. Cast iron and carbon steel cookware was used for generations and generations and for a good reason. 
It's much more durable than modern, thin Teflon pans and can hold much more energy. That really helps with cooking.
When developing IRONATE, we wanted to use that age-old technology but add something to it. We researched all the available materials and manufacturing techniques and IRONATE was born.

 
In the process of making a pizza-making gadget, we developed a piece of cookware that can really do anything and will last a lifetime. 
It's can withstand high temperatures and doesn't cool down much, when you put food in it, so it's perfect for searing those sous vide steaks, giving them a nice crust on the outside. 
You can use it to make vegetables. Just close the hot lid for a few minutes to cook them and then crank up the heat to add some color. 
Even the lid has a few tricks up its sleeve. If you’ve ever wanted to bake your pizza in an oven, you can use it instead of baking stones or steels and save up to $90.

It can also be used to keep your food warm for up to an hour. Just flip it around and serve your dinner on the plate. IRONATE doesn't use coating, so you won't damage the lid when cutting or using metal cutlery on it.

 

 

 

 

When designing new products, we look in the past for inspiration, but design for the future.
That's why you won't find a single piece of artificial material in our product, even the box that IRONATE comes in is wooden. And there is no built-in planned obsolescence. IRONATE is designed to last for generations.
The bulk of IRONATE is made out of carbon steel, hand welded together for ultimate durability. It's coated and seasoned with vegetable oil, that's all the rust protection you will ever need and it provides a great low-stick surface.

Those cool handles are made out of locally sourced oak or beech wood that can stand the test of time. Even the packaging is handmade out of untreated softwood boards.
We don't use artificial printing ink anywhere on IRONATE. All the logos and insignia are laser engraved into the material.
 
 
 

 
IRONATE comes with cool wooden handles that protect you from hot metal. They can be easily removed for easy cleaning or use in an oven or on open fire.
All handles are laser engraved with IRONATE logo. But our friends told us that IRONATE would make a perfect gift for special occasions like weddings, housewarming parties and birthdays.
So we decided to offer you, our Kickstarter backers, an option to choose a custom engraved handles. You can put anything you want on those handles (within reason).

 

Shorter pre-heating times and shorter baking times means that you will be able to enjoy the party with your guests, instead of waiting and sweating in your kitchen.
But it also means that you can save money and energy.
Faster pre-heat and cooking times mean less energy spent. That can translate into less dollars spent and your apartment will not turn into a sauna every time you make a pizza.
You will also save money on cookware. IRONATE is durable and made to last a lifetime, so it can be the only one you will ever buy.
Just think about all those cheap, thin pans you bought over the years. Sure, they are only $19,99 but it adds up if you have to buy a new one every few months.

Steel is a perfect material for cookware. It really is. Cleaning IRONATE is a breeze. You can put it in a dishwasher or clean it with warm soapy water. As long as you don't leave it wet for long periods of time, it's natural oil coating will prevent it from rusting.
It doesn't need any special maintenance either. Just add a few drops of oil now and then and it will reinforce its seasoning every time you use it.",41.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<br/>Back in 2010 I was a graduate design student with a physics background and a passion for coffee. I noticed people bringing French presses to work and leaving them on top of desks and filing cabinets for days, nasty used grounds and all as a sort of big, messy ode to a match made in heaven: coffee &amp; work. It was clear to me that people loved the idea of a simple way of making coffee that you could take with you, but no one loved cleaning up a messy coffee press. <br/> </div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446690053/pdmwyqifqaiyohtcqury.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>So I drew some sketches of an idea for a coffee press without the mess. One that would keep grounds contained in a pod so they’d be easy to remove, and I wound up spending my entire thesis year in the university machine shop fabricating the first prototypes. Along the way I realized the American Press was about much more than just being easy to clean. </p></div>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Once I saw the second prototype brewing for the first time, I knew I'd realized more than just my original vision for a coffee press without the mess. I realized pressure and ultra-fine steel filtration could brew a cleaner cup of coffee in less time, and brewing as you press made waiting a thing of the past. Just press and pour. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">And best of all, I saw how the design for the American Press created a visual experience unique in the coffee world as I pressed and watched a column of clear water transforming into a column of rich, dark coffee for the first time. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I continued to work through many twists and turns, wrong turns, and dead ends for years. I tried to do things myself, and I tried to seek out help.

<p><b>Q: How does the coffee taste??</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A: We wish we could get you all samples! But in lieu of that we've had many experts taste test various coffees brewed in our press and the most common notes are that it's surprisingly clean and complex, with distinct and subtle flavors and aromas preserved by its unique brewing mechanics and carefully designed filters.</p>
<p><b>Q: What type of filters does the American Press use?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A: The American Press uses a stainless steel inlet filter and an ultra-fine, 150 micron stainless steel outlet filter that preserves flavors and oils while restricting unwanted sediment and ""muddiness"" so your last sip as enjoyable as the first.</p>
<p><b>Q: How much coffee does the American Press make?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A: The American Press is sized to make a standard 3-cup serving, but can make up to 4 cups in a single press. This corresponds to 12-16 ounces, or approximately 350-475 ml. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Q: I know the American Press can make more than the standard 12-ounce serving, but can it make less?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A: Yes! Some customers prefer stronger coffee or may want a smaller, 8-ounce serving, for example. Either can be accomplished simply by adding less water. And if you really want to push the limits of the American Press' similarity to an espresso machine, you can try using even less water to ""press shots"".</p>
<p><b>Q: How long does it take to brew?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A: The American Press can make coffee surprisingly quickly. How fast you press is up to you and your tastes, but it can brew as you press in under a minute, though we recommend a slower 2-minute press including 20-30 seconds of pre-infusion (letting the grounds wet evenly after a short initial press/before your main press).</p>
<p><b>Q: Are there other sizes available?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A: We will be introducing the American Press in one size only, but may introduce other sizing options in the future. Luckily, the American Press can easily make less or more than the standard serving, and if its largest serving of 15 ounces still isn't quite enough, the American Press is unique both in actually being an enjoyable and fun way to brew coffee, and being easy to re-set for another round. If you have a group, we think everyone will want their own turn!</p>
<p><b>Q: How much coffee does the American Press use?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A: The reusable pod at the core of the American Press' brewing technology is sized to be filled by approximately 24 grams of coffee, corresponding to 12 grams/6 ounces of water, our recommended ratio. You can, however, add more or less coffee. If you prefer less bold coffee, try 20 grams for a 12 ounce serving. If you want to push the limits of your American Press, try tamping even more coffee in than the recommended 24 grams.</p>
<p><b>Q: What grind does the American Press use?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A: We recommend a standard, medium grind. The same used for most automatic coffee machines and the same you'll find in pre-ground coffee, but you can play with finer grinds. We do not, however, recommend using either very fine OR very coarse coffee. </p>
<p><b>Q: Is the American Press made of food-safe materials?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A: The American Press is made of the highest quality materials available and is entirely constructed from only 3 materials: Stainless steel (handle, lid exterior, rod and filters), BPA-free Tritan(R) (carafe, pod and structural components) and medical-grade silicone (seals and lid core).</p>
<p><b>Q: Is the American Press dishwasher safe?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A: Yes! The carafe is made of Tritan(R), the same BPA-free material used in Nalgene(R) bottles, Camelbak(R) products and high-end Vitamix(R) blender bodies was chosen for its strength and durability. It can be washed on top rack of the dishwasher without concern along with all parts of the American Press, though you may prefer to handwash the high-polish steel parts. The filter screen in the pod top can also be easily removed by pushing it out of the pod top with your finger, and the silicone gasket can be removed from the filter screen as well for thorough cleaning and drying, but please be careful with these small parts in the dishwasher (recommend placing them in a utensil basket by themselves).<br/> </p>
<p><b>Q: Is the Tritan carafe microwave-safe?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A: No! There is a piece of steel in the carafe, so it's not microwaveable. We recommend microwaving your water in a ceramic mug, then transferring it to your carafe. Though we prefer using an electric kettle ourselves, this method does have the added benefit of pre-heating you mug!<br/> </p>
<p><b>Q: I notice the American Press has no handle, isn't it too hot to pick up? How well insulated is the Tritan(R) carafe? </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A: Tritan(R) itself has some insulating properties, but the carafe is a double-wall, vacuum sealed design, offering a high-level of insulation that's completely cool to the touch, even when filled with boiling water.</p> <p> </p>

</div></div>","The American Press is unlike any brewer you've seen before. Its patented design brews quickly, has its own unique brewing character, is easy to clean, and offers a visually stunning, hands-on brewing experience that you simply have to see to believe. Read on, and watch on, to see what makes the American Press different. 

 

The American Press rapidly brews a rich and smooth cup by forcing water through an enclosed, reusable pod and an ultra-fine steel filter as you press. It combines the hands-on control connoisseurs love with simplicity and ease of use to create a craft coffee experience that's perfect for every morning.  
 
 
But the most striking part is what happens when you press. You're in control of forcing water through our patented pod as you press, creating a visual brewing experience that's unique in the coffee world. And since you control the speed, pressure and timing of extraction, you can brew your cup, your way, without the elbow grease you may be used to, thanks to our low-friction hydraulic seal. But don't take our word for it. Watch the magic that truly sets the American Press apart unfold right here in our videos, and see for yourself.
 

 
 
 


 
 
 

The American Press has many advantages but we're especially proud of fulfilling our original mission and inspiration to create a “coffee press without the mess”. Our reusable pod keeps mess contained and waste out of landfills, so cleanup is easy and it's eco-friendly, too. And it wouldn't be a coffee press without the mess if it dripped coffee all over the place, so our specially designed steel pouring edge is guaranteed to never spill a drop!  
But the American Press is about more than just being easy to clean! It's an easy to use craft brewing method that's convenient and easy to use while still being eco-friendly, it brews quickly, it's great for coffee and tea, and it offers a delightfully clean and complex brewing character all delivered with a little bit of visual magic.
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12-ounce design can brew more or less coffee, up to 15 ounces
Designed for medium grind coffee (pre-ground works fine)
Ultra-fine 150 micron stainless steel filtration
Shatterproof, dishwasher safe double-wall Tritan(R) carafe
Solid stainless steel handle and stainless steel pouring edge
Medical-grade silicone seals and lid core
100% BPA free

 
 

Whether you're at home or on the go, all you need is hot water and coffee to make an amazing cup of coffee anytime. Its beautiful design makes it the perfect addition to your kitchen counter top and portability means you can make great coffee at the office, in a hotel or around a campfire.
 


We have a production ready prototype ready and waiting, but we need your help to actually go into production. I've personally funded this project so far through my own savings and with the help of family and friends, but now I need a lot more friends! If you can help us fund the next chapter, you'll be a part of creating a new way to brew, bringing a startup to life, and we'll owe you a big thanks (and a lot of cool perks!).
 
UPDATE!! New Stretch Goal!Early Production! - Help us reach $100,000 and we’ll begin production early – The moment we hit $100,000 we’re cutting the checks for tooling, even if the campaign hasn’t ended yet. The earlier we get there, the earlier you get your press! 
 STRETCH GOAL REACHED! THANK YOU!!
Thanks to the pull we now have with over 1000 backers and over $100,000 in funding we have one of the best housewares factories in the world pitching in to expedite production of the American Press. Normally, tooling contracts would be completed 15 days after campaign end when final funds are disbursed, but thanks to your support we will have tooling production started almost a month early!

NEW PERKS!! Handmade letterpress art prints, designed & printed in Detroit 
Want some hand-pressed art prints to go with your hand-pressed coffee? Designed and printed in Detroit by the community letterpress studio “Signal Return”, our custom prints come in three different versions, each celebrating a unique aspect of our campaign: Beautiful mornings, coffee itself, and the heritage equipment that produced these prints in Eastern Market, Detroit: The venerable letterpress.
 


These perks have all been at least designed locally in Detroit, MI and, where possible, they're being produced locally as well. Our mug's original artwork was produced by the Detroit Woodtype Co. and the coffee selections are from the craft roasters at Hyperion Coffee Co. located in Ypsilanti, MI (yup, another startup aided by crowdfunding).





Back in 2010 I was a graduate design student with a physics background and a passion for coffee. I noticed people bringing French presses to work and leaving them on top of desks and filing cabinets for days, nasty used grounds and all as a sort of big, messy ode to a match made in heaven: coffee & work. It was clear to me that people loved the idea of a simple way of making coffee that you could take with you, but no one loved cleaning up a messy coffee press.  
So I drew some sketches of an idea for a coffee press without the mess. One that would keep grounds contained in a pod so they’d be easy to remove, and I wound up spending my entire thesis year in the university machine shop fabricating the first prototypes. Along the way I realized the American Press was about much more than just being easy to clean. 

 
 

Once I saw the second prototype brewing for the first time, I knew I'd realized more than just my original vision for a coffee press without the mess. I realized pressure and ultra-fine steel filtration could brew a cleaner cup of coffee in less time, and brewing as you press made waiting a thing of the past. Just press and pour. 
 

And best of all, I saw how the design for the American Press created a visual experience unique in the coffee world as I pressed and watched a column of clear water transforming into a column of rich, dark coffee for the first time. 
 

I continued to work through many twists and turns, wrong turns, and dead ends for years. I tried to do things myself, and I tried to seek out help. There were successes, and there were failures. Ultimately I found the right help and the right team, and together we’ve made it this far. Now the rest is up to you...

 

 
It's pretty much just me...
Amazing friends and family, a lot of awesome, independent freelancers, and these great organizations: 
 
  
 
Yes, when I started this, it was just me. It's been five years since I first walked into a university machine shop with no idea how to make a spice rack, much less a working prototype coffee press. I walked out months later with a beautiful, working prototype that made it clear to me that giving up would never be an option, and I’m certainly not going to start now.
 
 
 

Since then, I've assembled a dream team of designers, engineers, and business people. We have over a century of collective experience and everyone involved has launched or worked on successful projects and companies. Having a team like mine makes a huge difference. We are ready to do things right the first time, and are committed to delivering the best quality product. 
 
 
 
 

You can see that commitment in our prototype. I can tell you we've done our homework and the only thing missing is your help to continue to fuel our team with the cash they need to manufacture the American Press. We have come as far as we can alone - now we need your help to put the American Press into full-scale production.
 

 
 
 
 

As we continue working to build a company from the ground up with your help, we'll remain committed to making an impact in the communities we're a part of. That starts right here with this campaign. We knit together a network of creatives and agencies from California to New York with my home towns of Chicago and Detroit picking up most of the work between, but with special thanks to University of Pittsburgh fine arts professor Anna Lemnitzer and her home state of Montana for some amazing photography of the American Press there and in the American West.
 

Men and woman from across America have been a part of everything from creating our final prototype to photographing and filming it. The videos you see here were created by Michigan filmmaker Shawn Hamer and filmed right around the corner from us at our favorite restaurant in Ypsi, yet another crowdfunded startup, the Bona Sera Supper Club (special thanks to Bad Fairy & Wonder Woman!).

We have coffee available from the craft roasters at Hyperion Coffee Co. located in Ypsilanti, MI (yup, another startup aided by crowdfunding). 
 

 
Our promotional handbill as well as our favorite perk, the best way give someone (or yourself) the gift of crowdfunding, our ""golden"" ticket, were all designed by the Detroit letterpress studio, Signal Return, with copy writing assistance provided by Texas-based copywriter Kendra Greene. From there we'll remain committed both to delivering the best of high-quality, factory-made products from our own studio, as well as supporting and promoting handmade works by local artisans and their studios, both things we hope will have an impact far beyond this campaign or our own company.
 

 

There will still be risks and challenges. Even with the best talent and plenty of cash, manufacturing a new product can be tricky. The best prototype, CAD and engineering drawings don't guarantee that tooling comes out right the first time. There can be delays and costs can mount. We know from the many years of collective experience on our team that very strange things can happen during production, shipping and warehousing.

It will regulate itself to be below a specified temperature to make sure the LEDs last a long time (currently we work with 70 </i>°C<i> max.).</i></p><p><strong>How much does The Orb weigh and what are the exact dimensions?</strong></p><p><i>The Orb weighs 333g and the dimensions are 13 cm x 4 cm.</i></p><p><b>What material is The Orb made of?</b></p><p>The Orb is made of polycarbonate specially formulated for diffusion properties. The surface is treated, polished bronze that maximizes heat output.</p><p><strong>What kind of material is the Slaatto S1 made of?</strong></p><p><i>The Slaatto S1 is made of a polymer, which is selected due to its very remarkable light properties.</i></p><p><strong>Does the Orb replace my lightbulb?</strong></p><p><i>The Orb replaces your entire lamp. We are working on a solution to put your favourite lampshade on to the Orb.</i></p><p><strong>Can I replace the LEDs in the Orb or do I need to buy a new one?</strong></p><p><i>No, this is not a typical light bulb and it’s not to be opened in any way by the end user.</i></p><p><strong>Will The Orb work with any light fitting?</strong></p><p><i>The Orb needs power from the fitting.</i></p><p><strong>Does The Orb use more power than a traditional light bulb?</strong></p><p><i>The Orb can give a lot of light when fully lit, which does, of course, cost power. When compared to a traditional light bulb that gives the same amount of light as the Orb, it uses 80% less power. When you factor in that some moods and features can use less power than the traditional due to a smart energy consumption, the power saving goes up to 96%.</i></p><p><strong>How do I control the Orb light settings?</strong></p><p><i>You can control The Orb light setting with the included wall switches and the app, which gives you the freedom to change in-depth settings such as the creation of moods.</i></p><p><strong>How do you integrate with other home automation systems (Apple Home Kit, Google Home, Alexa etc.)</strong></p><p><i>Out of the box, the Orb is setup to work on our own platform. This means that the included wall switch - Eclipse, will be working with the Orb out of the box and ensures you’ll be up and running in no time.</i></p><p><i>We are working on integrating with leading home automation providers, and are closely monitoring the market for developments. From our side, we will be integrating with a select few of the leading platforms.</i></p><p><i>The Orb will not integrate with the Apple Homekit out of the box. We plan on integrating with Apple Homekit as it evolves in the near future. Our target is to have the best integrated user experience on the platform.</i></p><p><strong>Will Shade integrate into my IHC system?</strong></p><p>There are a lot of Intelligent Home Concept systems out there. They have a lot of interesting features that could be very nice if used together with the Shade system.</p><p>Presently, we cannot promise integration to these, the main reason being that they are not that intelligent. They control on the high voltage side which in our opinion is a suboptimal solution. They usually come with a significant of installation cost, which goes directly against our philosophy. Most of what they do, we can actually do a lot smarter.</p><p><strong>So will Shade be compatible with my ICH system?</strong></p><p>It depends on the system, but most likely yes. You cannot use the dimming function of your system but instead has to use Shade's system for this. You can turn the lamps on/off with the IHC system. You can program your IHC system to turn multiple orbs on/off with one switch for instance. You can also program your IHC system to turn the orbs on/off through the ICH scheduling if you would like that.</p><p>So most of the functionality of the IHC system compliments the orb functionality nicely. You just don’t need a IHC to do any of this with our system.</p><p><strong>Are there any other products planned in the near future?</strong></p><p><i>Definitely, follow us on Facebook or our website.</i></p><p><strong>What changes are you planning on doing to the hardware?</strong></p><p><i>All visual material in the campaign is done with our prototypes. Up until launch, we will continue to develop these to get the aesthetics and the functionality second to none. Our designer Øivind Alexander Slaatto will help us reach the premium level quality we are aiming for.</i></p><p><i>We are improving the design of the connector, and developing the controller, as well as the base unit. We will continuously communicate our progress, and we hope that you will trust our team on finalizing the details.</i></p><p> </p><h3>INSTALLATION</h3><p><strong>Will it work with the power that is available in my country?</strong></p><p><i>Yes, we use a switch mode that goes from 100-240VAC / 50-60Hz. This covers most of the world, of course including EU, US, Canada, UK, Australia.</i></p><p><i>The orb will be C-UL-US and CE certified, among other more local certifications.</i></p><p><strong>How do I install the Orb? Is it easy?</strong></p><p><i>Yes, it is quite easy. A bracket is fixed on the ceiling, AC wiring is done (phase and neutral) and the lamp is mounted on the bracket. The Orb is plugged in and can be turned on. Mind that some countries require authorised personnel to do the AC wiring.</i></p><p><strong>Can I install multiple units into one light circuit - for example, three lights over a dining table operated on one switch, or one two-way switch?</strong></p><p><i>You can install Orbs just like you do with regular lamps, so yes for example 3 Orbs on 1 circuit.</i></p><p><i>However, you really don’t have to control them like that, because you can pair Orbs and switches in our app. The Orbs just need power, and then you can set them up exactly as you want them.</i></p><p><strong>Do Orbs work with my dimmers?</strong></p><p><i>The dimming function will not work, since all that will do is give The Orb less power. You can wire the orb with many types of old dimmers and if you can use your dimmer for on/off, then it will also work for turning the orb on and off.</i></p><p><i>The wall switch that comes with the orb can do dimming (and way better than old dimmers), so you will just use that one instead.</i></p><p><strong>Is it safe to install in my children's bedroom?</strong></p><p><i>What we found in our user tests was that children love the different colors of the Orb.</i></p><p><i>The child can potentially unplug the orb if they can reach it. This is still safe since it does not get very warm. There is only low voltage in the cord, so it is much safer than regular light bulbs where children can unscrew it and get high voltage.</i></p><p><i>Please read the user manual and take necessary precautions before installing in children's rooms.</i></p><p> </p><h3>INDIEGOGO</h3><p><strong>How can I choose multiple perks?</strong></p><p><i>If you want different perks or need more orbs? Write to us at help@shadelights.com</i></p><p><strong>The discounts on the campaign are quite significant.

Here seen in a bedroom environment INTRODUCING THE ORBThe Orb is our take on the next generation smart light: a beautifully crafted designer lamp with an intelligent control system that brings a professional lighting solution to your home and works right out of the box.Unlike any other lamp, with the Orb you can control not only the intensity and colour but also the direction. A combination not available through any other product on the market.With Danish design at heart, the Orb isn’t just an intelligent lighting solution, but a beautiful light that will look stylish in any home.  Rendering of the final version of The Orb. Here seen in a kitchen environment BETTER LIGHT. BETTER LIVING.Our first lighting platform builds on the idea of being able to create a multitude of light settings with one lamp. Through conversations with lighting designers and architects, it became evident that good light needs to be dynamic. We need to create contrasts and leaps in luminance, add dashes of colour, and control the white balance. In order to do this, we needed to break out of the traditional way of creating lamps. This is the reasoning behind the Orb.First renderings of The Orb. Note that there are small changes to the final design THE RIGHT MOOD FOR ANY SITUATIONThe Orb comes with a set of pre-defined settings: the moods. The included wall switch is pre-configured with a selection of these, but they can easily be modified to suit your needs through the Better Light app. You can even create your own moods and save them for future use.The options for finding the right light are almost endless, but with our intuitive app and presets, you won’t have to tinker to find the right mood quickly.        INTELLIGENT FEATURESThe Orb comes with a range of intelligent features that support our mission of enhancing your home and influencing the atmosphere through the use of light. Part of our mission is to create a more hands-off experience, where you don't need to adjust your light over the course of the day, but where the Orb knows what you need - perhaps even before you do.Our feature set is in constant development, and we will be actively working with our users to develop new meaningful ways of adding intelligence to our lighting solutions.  The Night Fall feature over the course of an evening  INSIDE THE ORBWith its sleek and streamlined appearance, it can come as a bit of a surprise that the Orb is packed with high-tech components.The patented cooling system is designed specifically for the electronics inside the Orb, and the reflectors have the exact build that ensures optimal lighting. Nothing is left to chance - it truly is a beautifully crafted piece of designware.  Some of the first prototypes of The Orb. In the final version of The Orb there are small changes WORKS RIGHT OUT OF THE BOXWe believe that the ease of use is vital, so the Orb works right out of the box. Everything is already set up from the get-go, so you just need to unpack the product and plug it in. It literally takes minutes.The Orb comes with an included controller that ensures you’re up and running in no time, and have access to a range of pre-defined settings, without having to reach for your phone.   You can configure the Orb through your smartphone, and even connect to existing smart-home solutions. Choose the light mood from one of the predefined settings or easily create your own. Enable the intelligent features you wish to use. You now have complete control. The Better Light App - use it to control your Orb THE SHADE ECLIPSEFrom the start we have planned to include a control unit in the box with the Orb. We want users to have a positive unboxing experience, and find it crucial that users are up and running in no time.The design needed to be simple, intuitive, and functional, sticking to our Nordic design culture.With all this in mind, we introduce the Eclipse, the first control system for the Orb. It's elegant, easy to use, and will add another layer to the Shade experience.Newest renderings of The Orb and EclipseYou can use it mounted on a wall, or clip it off the wall to use it as a bedside or table-side remote control. It fits your needs.You receive an Eclipse with each Orb, and the remote is paired with its Orb out of the box. However, if you have multiple Orbs, you can easily create zones/rooms where several Orbs are controlled by the same remote, allowing you to have e.g. one Eclipse by the entrance to the room, and one by the sofa.  A close up of Eclipse.Operating the Eclipse is simple and even kids will be able to use it. A quick twist cycles through the pre-defined or customized moods, and the beauty of using rotation as the operator is that you can fit in as many moods as you wish. Sometimes 3 moods are enough, sometimes you want 10.A press on the front of the Eclipse turns the Orbs on or off. Hold the button and rotate to control to dim. An elegant and tactile solution. The Eclipse is your a portable innovative light switchOur plan is to manufacture the Shade Eclipse using a high-quality polymer, and the Bluetooth LE technology that is used to communicate means that you can have the switch operative for years without changing batteries... and yes - the batteries WILL be easily exchangeable.  A CONNECTED HOMEThe Orb is a connected device. You can easily add more Orbs and configure them through the Better Ligh app interface. You now control rooms instead of individual lamps.Through the use of Bluetooth LE technology, the Orbs communicate over their own network without having to use your Wi-Fi. This ensures that external network problems don't have any influence on the stability of the Orbs. With the Better Light app, you can choose from The Orb’s built-in mood settings or manually control the colour, intensity, and direction of light. Find it in App Store or Google Play    THE SLAATTO S1 SILHOUETTEIn addition to the Orb, we also created a complementing lampshade that surrounds the Orb and accentuates the effects of directional lighting. The Slaatto S1 resembles the shape of a flower, and its ""petals"" can be moved or adapted depending on your needs and preferences.The Slaatto S1 was created in collaboration with Øivind Alexander Slaatto, an award-winning Danish designer. Øivind’s design philosophy and experience with world-famous Danish high-end brands proved to be a great addition to Shade's drive to innovate.  As a result of this collaboration, Slaatto S1 was born. It embodies a simple yet poetic design approach, celebrating traditional Danish design roots while seeking inspiration in the world of nature. Øivind Slaatto working at his workshop. ADJUSTABLE LAMPSHADE    TECH SPECSThe Orb packs a punch. It's roughly the size of a mango, but don't be fooled by its small size. The high-quality components add up to an extraordinary product that not only looks good - but performs when needed.     HOW WE GOT HEREWe at Shade want to rethink how we interact with light and how to provide a solution that enables us to dictate the atmospheres we want to have.Over the past 15 months, we have put an enormous amount of energy and work into the process of creating the perfect lighting and we are finally at a stage where we can show prototypes that support our idea.As of now, we are in the final stages of the product hardware development, but still need to complete the software part, and run all the necessary tests. Early sketches of The Orb   One of our first prototypes of The Orb Early concept renderings of The Orb Final rendering of The Orb TIMELINE  MEET THE TEAMShade is a tech and design startup from Copenhagen, Denmark. We were founded in 2015 by two engineers who wanted to revolutionize the way people interact with artificial lighting. Over the course of 2016 we grew the team to over ten employees and created fully working prototypes of the products.Our team consists of experienced professionals, mixed with young talent, within software and hardware engineering, product design and business administration. One thing we all have in common, is that we want to improve the way we light our homes.We already have fully working prototypes and it is our goal now to deliver fully working Orbs in the fall of 2017. We need your help to achieve that aim and bring our lighting revolution into everybody’s home. Please help us with that final push, so we can enlighten your home with our products.  The team behind the Crowdfunding campaign,  SHADE MANIFESTOLight doesn’t just help us see in the dark, it helps influence our moods and feelings, whether we’re indoors or outdoors. In Denmark, our favourite word is ‘Hygge’, which is roughly translated as the idea of cosiness and making our homes comfier. Having a product that is able to instantly create different atmospheres gives people the power to improve their moods.”Shade enables you to create what you want within seconds and lets you set the tone for your life.   RISKS & CHALLENGESOver the past 1 ½ years, we have worked hard to get to the current stage with working prototypes and basic software functionality. Our biggest motivation is to deliver a product of high quality and outstanding performance: The devil is in the detail and ensuring we reach the level we are aiming for will take a tremendous effort.In order for this to happen, we gathered an experienced team with a varied set of skills, that is working tirelessly on the finalization of the Orb and all other Shade products.As of now, we are at a late stage in the hardware development, but ensuring that we can ramp up production at the quality we want, means we have to invest in molds and manufacturing equipment. Additionally, the further development of software is a significant task, and even though we currently have a strong team, we will look to strengthen our line-up with additional talents.We have already set up partnerships with a strong network of suppliers, and we’ve secured their support ensuring that we are not alone in terms of development, component sourcing, and logistics, to name but a few areas. We cannot do this alone, and we need to make sure we have the best heads helping us out.We won’t hide from the fact that this is a complex operation, but with a bit of help from our backers, we will be ensuring the level of stability needed to focus on the task at hand.This campaign gives us the final push to finish the creation of the product that not only we, but everyone will love! An early prototype of the Slaatto S1  FAQ SHIPPINGDo you ship worldwide?Yes, we are shipping our products worldwide.

Select your country in the checkout process and the shipping costs will be shown instantly.I live in Denmark, can I pick up the products myself?No, unfortunately, you can not pick up the products yourself. CUSTOMER SUPPORTWhat type of warranty do you offer on Shade's products?All Shade products come with a 2-year manufacturer's warranty.How do you handle returns?If you experience problems with your Orb, please contact us at help@shadelights.com.Where can I get help if there is a problem with the product?If you need more help our site will be updated with support assets, and you can always write to us at help@shadelights.comHow do you handle taxes?The backer is responsible, please check your country's import duties before purchasing.Where are the products shipped from?The products are designed, developed, manufactured, and shipped from Denmark.TECHNICALHow long do the LEDs in the Orb last?The typical lifetime of the LEDs in the Orb is up to 50.000 hrs, depending on how warm they get - which we control intelligently in the Orb. How warm does the Orb get?The warmth of the Orb depends on usage - the Orb is substantially cooler than light bulbs due to the larger diameter. It will regulate itself to be below a specified temperature to make sure the LEDs last a long time (currently we work with 70 °C max.).How much does The Orb weigh and what are the exact dimensions?The Orb weighs 333g and the dimensions are 13 cm x 4 cm.What material is The Orb made of?The Orb is made of polycarbonate specially formulated for diffusion properties. The surface is treated, polished bronze that maximizes heat output.What kind of material is the Slaatto S1 made of?The Slaatto S1 is made of a polymer, which is selected due to its very remarkable light properties.Does the Orb replace my lightbulb?The Orb replaces your entire lamp. We are working on a solution to put your favourite lampshade on to the Orb.Can I replace the LEDs in the Orb or do I need to buy a new one?No, this is not a typical light bulb and it’s not to be opened in any way by the end user.Will The Orb work with any light fitting?The Orb needs power from the fitting.Does The Orb use more power than a traditional light bulb?The Orb can give a lot of light when fully lit, which does, of course, cost power. When compared to a traditional light bulb that gives the same amount of light as the Orb, it uses 80% less power. When you factor in that some moods and features can use less power than the traditional due to a smart energy consumption, the power saving goes up to 96%.How do I control the Orb light settings?You can control The Orb light setting with the included wall switches and the app, which gives you the freedom to change in-depth settings such as the creation of moods.How do you integrate with other home automation systems (Apple Home Kit, Google Home, Alexa etc.)Out of the box, the Orb is setup to work on our own platform. This means that the included wall switch - Eclipse, will be working with the Orb out of the box and ensures you’ll be up and running in no time.We are working on integrating with leading home automation providers, and are closely monitoring the market for developments. From our side, we will be integrating with a select few of the leading platforms.The Orb will not integrate with the Apple Homekit out of the box. We plan on integrating with Apple Homekit as it evolves in the near future. Our target is to have the best integrated user experience on the platform.Will Shade integrate into my IHC system?There are a lot of Intelligent Home Concept systems out there. They have a lot of interesting features that could be very nice if used together with the Shade system.Presently, we cannot promise integration to these, the main reason being that they are not that intelligent. They control on the high voltage side which in our opinion is a suboptimal solution. They usually come with a significant of installation cost, which goes directly against our philosophy. Most of what they do, we can actually do a lot smarter.So will Shade be compatible with my ICH system?It depends on the system, but most likely yes. You cannot use the dimming function of your system but instead has to use Shade's system for this. You can turn the lamps on/off with the IHC system. You can program your IHC system to turn multiple orbs on/off with one switch for instance. You can also program your IHC system to turn the orbs on/off through the ICH scheduling if you would like that.So most of the functionality of the IHC system compliments the orb functionality nicely. You just don’t need a IHC to do any of this with our system.Are there any other products planned in the near future?Definitely, follow us on Facebook or our website.What changes are you planning on doing to the hardware?All visual material in the campaign is done with our prototypes. Up until launch, we will continue to develop these to get the aesthetics and the functionality second to none. Our designer Øivind Alexander Slaatto will help us reach the premium level quality we are aiming for.We are improving the design of the connector, and developing the controller, as well as the base unit. We will continuously communicate our progress, and we hope that you will trust our team on finalizing the details. INSTALLATIONWill it work with the power that is available in my country?Yes, we use a switch mode that goes from 100-240VAC / 50-60Hz. This covers most of the world, of course including EU, US, Canada, UK, Australia.The orb will be C-UL-US and CE certified, among other more local certifications.How do I install the Orb? Is it easy?Yes, it is quite easy. A bracket is fixed on the ceiling, AC wiring is done (phase and neutral) and the lamp is mounted on the bracket. The Orb is plugged in and can be turned on. Mind that some countries require authorised personnel to do the AC wiring.Can I install multiple units into one light circuit - for example, three lights over a dining table operated on one switch, or one two-way switch?You can install Orbs just like you do with regular lamps, so yes for example 3 Orbs on 1 circuit.However, you really don’t have to control them like that, because you can pair Orbs and switches in our app. The Orbs just need power, and then you can set them up exactly as you want them.Do Orbs work with my dimmers?The dimming function will not work, since all that will do is give The Orb less power. You can wire the orb with many types of old dimmers and if you can use your dimmer for on/off, then it will also work for turning the orb on and off.The wall switch that comes with the orb can do dimming (and way better than old dimmers), so you will just use that one instead.Is it safe to install in my children's bedroom?What we found in our user tests was that children love the different colors of the Orb.The child can potentially unplug the orb if they can reach it. This is still safe since it does not get very warm. There is only low voltage in the cord, so it is much safer than regular light bulbs where children can unscrew it and get high voltage.Please read the user manual and take necessary precautions before installing in children's rooms. INDIEGOGOHow can I choose multiple perks?If you want different perks or need more orbs?

<p>By far, one of the biggest battles facing
our generations is against the ongoing threat of climate change. Climate change is no fictitious topic, but an everyday problem. We can see the weather changing year by year, the news are full with natural disasters and the water levels are rising faster than expected in our oceans. What few people know though, is that currently 5 million people are dying annually because of climate change. It is absolutely essential to
switch from energy sources, such as coal, nuclear power and oil to renewable
energies as fast as possible to avert the increase of carbon dioxide
transferred into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The Point of No Return regarding global
warming, according to the study published by Greenpeace in Jan 2013, is 2020! </p>
<p>Governments worldwide have started shifting
their energy sources and have been utilizing new green technologies. We believe the key
to saving our environment depends on the implementation of renewable energy
solutions, especially in the developing countries, like Brazil, India, South
Africa, etc. That way we can avoid large
scale fossil fuel projects which are currently being planned/conducted. Let us
learn from the mistakes in the past. </p>

Musk (Tesla) initiated in the US with Solar City, developed it further, and
integrated several development schemes in our unique business model to also make
a direct impact for the local citizens.</p>

can be used for a global approach to fight climate change, to help poor people develop
a sustainable income base and to deliver green energy solutions for the
increasing electricity demand on the world. </p><p>Through our own eyes, we have seen what suffering and opportunities co-exist in India. The national government and a few state governments in India are achieving their set targets to go green as soon as possible. The energy market is the most lucrative sector in India, as 35% of India does not have access to the grid/ regular electricity supply. On top, every percentage increase in the economic growth, India needs 0,75% more energy. This means, India requires 5% in average annually more electricity supply.  Considering all these facts, and some logical thinking, one can estimate what India offers as a potential in this sector. </p><p>Our Panel of engineers, scientists and economists have been working with us for FREE for the last two years on this project to achieve our Vision. We believe it is possible to change the direction our world is steering towards. </p><p><i>""The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.""</i> Albert Einstein</p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">The Risks:</b><br/></p><p></p><p>We have two weeks to raise enough money to book

4 INDIAOur Plan is to install Renewable Energy Power Systems, consisting of biogas, solar, wind and storage solutions integrated into buildings in cities and for remote villages in India. This is the only alternative to coal and nuclear power plants. Green electricity is the basic requirement for sustainable development and will also lead to poverty reduction.We need your support to present our solution to investors, multi-national corporations and other global players at the Transatlantic Makers Conference from the 2-4th September 2014.What is our vision with this project?  
Our vision is
to implement our unique model that will revolutionize the business world because it:
- 
Combines Social Responsibility with Business Opportunities.  
- 
Builds Bridges
between established and emerging Economies
- 
Tackles Poverty through Energy, Education and Employment Programmes
- 
Contributes significantly in Saving Our Environment!
What is our plan?Phase I:   Feasibility Study incl. first simulations *almost completedPhase II:  Formation of the Conglomerate *Talks in ProgressPhase III: Finishing the Feasibility Study incl. a Pilot Project in IndiaPhase IV: Setting up of the 1st FundPhase V:   Implementation of RE Systems and becoming the E-ProviderWhat are our goals and who is
our target group? 
Our aim is to become the major green electricity
provider in India through financing, installing and managing Renewable Energy Systems in India. The main target groups are residential buildings,
shopping malls and villages.How will we achieve our goals
as a small start-up company?
1. In forming a Conglomerate with international
investors, multi-national companies specialized in the Renewable Energy field
and local Indian manufacturers and EP Contractors.2. Because of our Panel of highly skilled engineers, scientists and economists, who have been working for FREE like ourselves, because we believe there is a solution for a better future for us and our children.3. The technology is already available to set up Renewable Energy Systems in India. It is now our task to co-ordinate it by bringing the key players together and making this project lucrative! Why should I support this
project?With this project we have the unique opportunity to
introduce sustainable green energy systems into India on a large scale level and
significantly reduce carbon emissions as a result. Major investors and companies want to work with us because of our network, our know-how and our passion, but we need your help to get to the final stages!Why do you need this financing?For Phase I & II,
which includes:Preparation for Investor Pitches  Travel expenses to USA (New York & San Francisco)  Travel expenses to India  OfficeContracts for conglomerate partnersSoftware
The Story behind Eurobrain:Our Earths Problem:
By far, one of the biggest battles facing
our generations is against the ongoing threat of climate change. Climate change is no fictitious topic, but an everyday problem. We can see the weather changing year by year, the news are full with natural disasters and the water levels are rising faster than expected in our oceans. What few people know though, is that currently 5 million people are dying annually because of climate change. It is absolutely essential to
switch from energy sources, such as coal, nuclear power and oil to renewable
energies as fast as possible to avert the increase of carbon dioxide
transferred into the atmosphere.
The Point of No Return regarding global
warming, according to the study published by Greenpeace in Jan 2013, is 2020! 
Governments worldwide have started shifting
their energy sources and have been utilizing new green technologies. We believe the key
to saving our environment depends on the implementation of renewable energy
solutions, especially in the developing countries, like Brazil, India, South
Africa, etc. That way we can avoid large
scale fossil fuel projects which are currently being planned/conducted. Let us
learn from the mistakes in the past. 
Invest in us to accomplish our vision, which is
to become the Renewable Energy
Electricity Provider for businesses, middle class segment and villages in India
with an innovative social business model.No Electricity, No Development, No Poverty ReductionOur Solution:Starting out as a consulting company
specialized in the field of renewable energy, we have realized in the past two
years that Brazil and India are going in the right direction in regards to implementing
green technology. They only need financial and technological investments to
avoid setting up further nuclear and coal power stations. We took the model of Elon
Musk (Tesla) initiated in the US with Solar City, developed it further, and
integrated several development schemes in our unique business model to also make
a direct impact for the local citizens.
Our plan is to install renewable energy
sources in hospitals, shopping centers, universities and in off-grid villages that desperately need access
to sustainable energy, starting with India. We are currently planning and are
involved in initial talks to form a conglomerate with following companies: Simultaneously, we are
working on the Feasibility Study for the Energy 4 India project, where our Panel
has concluded the first phase. To complete the feasibility study, to establish the
conglomerate and to present our project to international investors at the
Transatlantic Makers Conference in New York City on the 2-4 September 2014, we
need you!Our Motivation:We at Eurobrain
Consulting dedicated ourselves to this project entirely for a very simple
reason: the greatest responsibility of our generation is the survival of our
planet. We believe that this will be one of the most significant models that
can be used for a global approach to fight climate change, to help poor people develop
a sustainable income base and to deliver green energy solutions for the
increasing electricity demand on the world. Through our own eyes, we have seen what suffering and opportunities co-exist in India. The national government and a few state governments in India are achieving their set targets to go green as soon as possible. The energy market is the most lucrative sector in India, as 35% of India does not have access to the grid/ regular electricity supply. On top, every percentage increase in the economic growth, India needs 0,75% more energy. This means, India requires 5% in average annually more electricity supply.  Considering all these facts, and some logical thinking, one can estimate what India offers as a potential in this sector. Our Panel of engineers, scientists and economists have been working with us for FREE for the last two years on this project to achieve our Vision. We believe it is possible to change the direction our world is steering towards. ""The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing."" Albert EinsteinThe Risks:We have two weeks to raise enough money to book
the flight to present ourselves to investment firms and decision makers in the
energy market to gain their support – Four weeks to raise 12,500 EUR. If we get 250 people to donate just 50 EUR each, we will be able to realize our goal - 50 EUR
is  a nice meal for two, a night out in a
club or a monthly electricity bill. Of course, there is always a risk that the investors present are not interested about our project; or not being able to make the Feasibility Study currently lucrative enough to set up the Fund, or the implementation could take much longer than expected,... But similar to Thomas Edison, we believe a failure will not stop us, but motivate us to find a solution that will be successful !!!
No Risk, No ChangeYour Action:This is where we need you, friends. Our plan to implement this new business approach has already awakened interest on the international platform. We were selected out of 100s of start-ups by Berlin Partner to present this project in New York and San Francisco. We have the team, the technology partners and the determination to bring the renewable energy sources to another level. It is time to take action on a global scale, as the threat is facing all of us, and not just a select few. To be successful and realize the final steps, we need your support – in whichever way you can. Invest 5 EUR, 50 EUR, or 500 EUR! Share this message on social media sites, Like it on Facebook, tell your colleagues, friends and family. All help is needed and much appreciated!It is a small individual sacrifice that provides us a chance to significantly reduce our carbon footprint on this earth. We need to act now to avert the tragedies of climate change that await us, our children and our grandchildren if we keep moving forward with blinders on.The time is there now for us to take a deep
breath and stand up for us, for our children and our earth – help us implement
renewable energy solutions in India. Together we can take a big leap towards a
future with 100% renewable energy.

<p><i>Time </i></p>
<p>Receive an alert when an item is left on for too long.  This is specific to the item being monitored.  When you set up Eyetemp, you will choose the type of item you are monitoring when you pair the device.</p>
<p><i>Location </i></p>
<p>If you leave your residence while an item being monitored is considered in use, you will receive an alert.  For example, if you leave while your stove is left on and being monitored by Eyetemp, you will receive an alert to remind you that the stove is in use.</p>
<p><i>Drastic temperature increase </i></p>
<p>If a rapid and drastic temperature change is noted, there is an alert that will be sent to notify you.  This will note a potentially dangerous situation.</p>
<p><i>Emergency contacts </i></p>
<p>When setting up the app you will have the option to add up to 3 emergency contacts.  If you are non responsive to an alert, after a designated time period, the app will send a text notification to your emergency contact 1.  If there is no change and an item is still left on with no response, a notification will be sent to emergency contact 2 and then contact 3. </p>
<p><i>Additional </i></p>
<p>We are currently in the process of applying the option of having a call center notified after all of the emergency contacts are utilized and the problem remains.  This will be an optional feature.  We are also in the process of working on making the device compatible with other smart home networks.  This will also be an optional feature.</p>

<p><strong>Customer Survey Facts</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We did a customer survey and received some very interesting feedback.  46% of people say they have not left a heated device on but 72% of them have turned around to check if they did after leaving a residence and 95% of everyone who took it would buy a device that alerts them if they left something on via a smart phone.  It is interesting that although they did not encounter the actual problem the worry factor of leaving something on is significant enough.</p>

</div></div>","We are striving to make a difference and impact lives through fire safety and prevention.  The design and use of this device is so simple that even a non-tech savvy user can utlize it.  There is only a minimum initial set up required and then we take it from there!




 

After Eyetemp is connected on your mobile app, just place the device on the item you selected and “turn us on!!”  Eyetemp takes over from there.   It really is that easy!!

Time 
Receive an alert when an item is left on for too long.  This is specific to the item being monitored.  When you set up Eyetemp, you will choose the type of item you are monitoring when you pair the device.
Location 
If you leave your residence while an item being monitored is considered in use, you will receive an alert.  For example, if you leave while your stove is left on and being monitored by Eyetemp, you will receive an alert to remind you that the stove is in use.
Drastic temperature increase 
If a rapid and drastic temperature change is noted, there is an alert that will be sent to notify you.  This will note a potentially dangerous situation.
Emergency contacts 
When setting up the app you will have the option to add up to 3 emergency contacts.  If you are non responsive to an alert, after a designated time period, the app will send a text notification to your emergency contact 1.  If there is no change and an item is still left on with no response, a notification will be sent to emergency contact 2 and then contact 3. 
Additional 
We are currently in the process of applying the option of having a call center notified after all of the emergency contacts are utilized and the problem remains.  This will be an optional feature.  We are also in the process of working on making the device compatible with other smart home networks.  This will also be an optional feature.
There are additional alerts and feature options available.
 





 
Customer Survey Facts
 
We did a customer survey and received some very interesting feedback.  46% of people say they have not left a heated device on but 72% of them have turned around to check if they did after leaving a residence and 95% of everyone who took it would buy a device that alerts them if they left something on via a smart phone.  It is interesting that although they did not encounter the actual problem the worry factor of leaving something on is significant enough.
 
The Eyetemp Story

 
 

Why do we need your help?
 
We decided to do a campaign to learn what you, the market wants.  We want to hear your feedback and suggestions.  We have the flexibility to make adjustments to cater to your needs and wants.  This is why we set a maximum delivery date next year to leave additional time although we intend to do everything in our power to get the devices to you sooner.
We need to raise demand to get manufacturing and tooling costs reduced.  With your orders and support, this will help us achieve our goal.  It is our mission to keep retail costs down so Eyetemp can be utilized in as many homes as possible.  This impact will save lives and start to reduce the negative statistics.  That is what the real goal is!!  Saving lives!!
 

Our upcoming Milestones include the following:
Finalize all engineering designs
Enhance the UI experience for users through an “easy to use” mobile app
Manufacturing and tooling
Optimization of product
Additional product testing
Packaging and Labels
 
Other ways you can help?
 
Help us make noise about our Eyetemp campaign by sharing our campaign.  Remember every share can potentially save a life.
 
Future of Eyetemp
 
We are working on deals with insurance companies to lower your rates if you have an Eyetemp in your house.  We are also working on setting up an emergency response call center as an optional feature to the emergency contacts and app.  We will constantly be looking for ways to enhance the current Eyetemp product and will have a variety of products that will follow.

<p><span>They told me work hard and be happy with the end result because I worked hard to get back to where I was. </span></p>

<p><span>Coming up to Canadian nationals I was more nervous than anything so my plan was to avoid thinking about it until I stepped on the 100m line. I came second place which was something I was perfectly happy with seeing all I been through. </span></p>
<p><span>Next up was my 200m and I won! I couldn’t believe it, all my work paid off and I was on my way to London.

<p><span>The feeling of knowing that I’m going to be watched by millions of people gave me the greatest feeling of satisfaction because of how hard I worked to get there and that I scaled every bump in the road fighting for what I want.

LuminAID: Give Light, Get Light
About the Project
LuminAID Lab is proud to introduce the LuminAID light: a solar-rechargeable, inflatable lamp that packs flat and inflates to create a lightweight, waterproof lantern. Safe, sustainable, and portable, the LuminAID light provides up to six hours of LED light, ideal for disaster relief situations, recreational use outdoors, or in the home as an extra light source. Our mission: make light more affordable, sustainable, and available for everyone. 
 
Join us in the “Give Light, Get Light” campaign as we seek to launch the LuminAID light and distribute it in January 2012 to you and to our community projects. Take a LuminAID light with you on your next adventure or trip, tuck it away in your first aid kit, or string them together to light your path ahead. $25 pre-buys you one light and gives another to someone in need.
 
Your gift of light will give one student 4 more hours to study at night. It will allow one small business owner to stay open for a few extra hours. Give in honor of loved ones for the holidays and we will e-mail you a tribute card to let them know. Give in bulk, and we will custom print your logo on the LuminAID lights you donate. 
 
Stay connected through our community map. Send us your photos of travels with the LuminAID light and we will post them on our blog. 
 
Forbes has called it: “a possible alternative to Thomas Edison’s 1879 electric discovery that has the potential to change, not only the light bulb, but also the world.” Help us make this world brighter. #GiveLight.  
Learn More at www.luminAIDlab.comFollow us on Twitter @luminAIDlab #GiveLight  Visit us on Facebook 


The LuminAID light has a thin, rechargeable battery, a state of the art solar panel, and super bright LEDs. The semi-transparent plastic material diffuses the LEDs. The reinforced handle makes it durable and easy to carry.

Technical Specifications
Waterproof design can float
Press button for Off, High, and Low light settings
Fully Charges in 4-6 hours of sunlight
4 hours of 35 lumens on HIGH for reading/task work
6 hours of 20 lumens on LOW for safety/night light
Rechargeable batteries can be recharged 800 times
Patent pending

Carry light with you on your next trek and we'll post your stories and images to our blog. Check out the ""Carry Light"" Package. Pledge Packages also include custom print options. Limited Edition LuminAID light print pattern will be designed by a graphic designer.

Community Projects for Matching Lights
We are partnering with organizations to help distribute and field test the LuminAID lights. In Rajasthan, India, where 1 in 2 households lack electricity, we are working with with Root Alliance to distribute the LuminAID lights to rural schools, homes and small-business owners. On our blog, we’ll detail progress through video and pictures of all of our community projects. If you are an organization interested in receiving and distributing lights, please contact us at info@luminAIDlab.com.

<p>What exactly inspired us to do propolis? In a nutshell, “necessity is the mother of invention”. In our daily Internet experience, we lacked two main features:</p>
<p>1. Too many services online. Now there are many services online such as your email, social network, professional network, to-do-list, calendar, streaming websites, contacts, etc. That’s overwhelming. You can’t drag things from one service to another.  Propolis will fix that with keeping security and privacy in mind.</p>
<p>2. We like the fact that we socialize with our friends online, but we can’t find the people we need or want to connect with. Why can’t I find another person who is interested in palying a basketball game, or who is interested in an online game, or who is working in my same company and interested in starting a union (j/k).</p>
<p>For those two necessities, propolis is being invented. Thomas Edison once said, “To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk”, we have the junk, and working on the imagination :)</p>
<p><strong>Why Propolis?</strong><br/>
This project is unique as it offers the user:<br/>
1. The ability to expand his network and expertise according to his interests and what matters to him.<br/>
2. The ability to organize all his online services at one place and be able to synchronize them, and move items from one service to another.<br/>
3. Be able to set his own privacy and protect his information online.</p>

<p><strong>Why do we need donations?</strong><br/>
This project requires extensive effort in order to develop it into an elegant, efficient, secure tool. We are working on the programming development, however, we still require extra help. We believe that the $20,000 will help us in securing these resources to at least launch the beta version of the website. There are plenty of ideas, and we wish to implement most of it in the beta version.</p>

2. We like the fact that we socialize with our friends online, but we can’t find the people we need or want to connect with. Why can’t I find another person who is interested in palying a basketball game, or who is interested in an online game, or who is working in my same company and interested in starting a union (j/k).
For those two necessities, propolis is being invented. Thomas Edison once said, “To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk”, we have the junk, and working on the imagination :)
Why Propolis?
This project is unique as it offers the user:
1. The ability to expand his network and expertise according to his interests and what matters to him.
2. The ability to organize all his online services at one place and be able to synchronize them, and move items from one service to another.
3. Be able to set his own privacy and protect his information online.

Why do we need donations?
This project requires extensive effort in order to develop it into an elegant, efficient, secure tool. We are working on the programming development, however, we still require extra help. We believe that the $20,000 will help us in securing these resources to at least launch the beta version of the website. There are plenty of ideas, and we wish to implement most of it in the beta version.
Your help & donation would be greatly appreciated. If you would like to help out, please email: help@join-propolis.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>TickTime is a sophisticated timer. It is simple to operate by changing its positions. Meanwhile, if you want to manually set the time perfectly to every second, just easily push two buttons for setting the exact minute and second as you like.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/YkyZJ5UGCgGHn4lDpw/source.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Also, you can adjust the alarm volume to the appropriate level, including silent mode, to notify you in different situations. </p>

<p>Place TickTime with its name facing upwards and counting time begins. The time range is from 00:01 to 99:59. Plenty of time to time that meeting, or that speech, or the time your children spend on their homework!</p>

</div></div>","With more and more of us working remotely, it's more important than ever to make best use of our time. With TickTime beside you on your home desk, you'll be able to squeeze every ounce of productivity out of every minute of the day you're working—and still have time for family and friends.


TickTime gives you that extra focus you need to make the most of every minute of your day.Be more efficient. Use your time more effectively. Do what needs doing in the time you've got. Every second is precious and TickTime helps you focus on what you're doing and get it done. Boost your productivity. Complete tasks in the time you've set aside for them.
Fans of this ultra-efficient approach to time management invented back in the 1980s definitely need some TickTime in their life. Dividing your day into separate 25 minute phases is easy with TickTime. 25 minutes is one of the preset countdowns built-in to TickTime.   (Wikipedia) Enhance your productivity, making your every day more than 24 hours!

The timer that's of its time. TickTime is the timer born in the 21st Century, for the 21st Century. Forget sandtimers and stopwatches. Their time is up. 

It's sleek and sophisticated. 
It starts and stops without you having to press a button. And it's totally portable. So wherever and whenever you need to keep track of time, TickTime will be there.


Once upon a time, sand in a glass was used to countdown time. Then big, bulky stopwatches with buttons everywhere took over. Now it's time for TickTime. The sleek and simple way to countdown time.





“Today we will look at the future with this Prototype Timer! With its space age look and quality feel, it really gives the timer a new twist!”---Tech savvy Khan Flicks 


Change the way you manage your time to make the most of every minute of every day with the brand new fun and functional timer.


TickTime is light and small. So it fits into any pocket and any bag for ultimate portability.

 

TickTime certainly ticks plenty of boxes when it comes to different ways to use it:



 
Working--On a tight timescale? Want to spend a specific amount of time on a certain job? Get TickTime beside you on your desk to help you with your time management.
Workouts--Set yourself targets during gym sessions. Beat your personal best. TickTime records all your jogs, sprints, cycles, and rows so you can see the pace you're setting
Games--Use it as an alternative to a sandglass/egg timer for all kinds of games in which you've got a limited time to take your turn.
Cooking--How long has the pizza been in the oven? How much longer for the perfect souffle? TickTime will tell you.

TickTime has 6 preset timings. Just flip TickTime so the time you want to count down is facing up. The timer starts automatically. So you won't waste a second and you'll get more out of every minute of every day.
THE SIX PRESETS:



TickTime is a sophisticated timer. It is simple to operate by changing its positions. Meanwhile, if you want to manually set the time perfectly to every second, just easily push two buttons for setting the exact minute and second as you like.  
Also, you can adjust the alarm volume to the appropriate level, including silent mode, to notify you in different situations. 


Place TickTime with its name facing upwards and counting time begins. The time range is from 00:01 to 99:59. Plenty of time to time that meeting, or that speech, or the time your children spend on their homework!
 


 


 


Choose from a AUDIBLE ALARM with fully adjustable volume control. 
Or a VISUAL ALARM with a flashing light. Handy if you're deep in concentration and don't want the noise of an alarm to make you jump. Or if  you're working or studying in a public space such as a library, classroom, or office.
 


LED Display promotes better experience of visual images when you are tracking the time. The digital numbers and icons you see on the screen are much brighter in great colors. There is no motion delay on the screen. 


TickTime has a magnetic side to stick to the fridge or any metal surfaces to leave you hands-free while keeping track of the time.

Stick TickTime to the fridge or stovetop when you're cooking in the kitchen.
Stick TickTime to the whiteboard during a presentation or lecture.

TickTime is chargeable. No batteries are required. Simply plug-in your phone charger to boost TickTime's power. Save you tons of extra money to buy batteries and let us go environmental-friendly. 
 





“Make counting down fun & easy! With TickTime, you will be sure to have fun counting down activities like exercising, cooking, games e.t.c”
-----See what gadget and tech reviewer Samuel Lewis thought about TickTime when he recently tested it.

ALMOST THERE!!!    UPDATE - Thanks to our many supporters, we reached our initial $5000 goal last year and the house is now up and open for guests , the fruit trees have shot up to 10ft tall, and the greenhouse is producing heaps of food (see Updates).   Our need now is to really fine tune the growing systems and insulate the greenhouse to test our production in the coming winter. We are raising the next $5000 in the coming months to install our aquaponics, assemble the automatic watering and ventilation systems, and a second layer of greenhouse within the existing  structure to keep our plants from freezing. Take a look at our perks and choose a gift in thanks for your contributions.  THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

STEEL FRAME DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND HURRICANE FORCE WINDS



""Building global food security, One house at-a-Time""

   Across the world people increasingly need a low-cost reliable source of fresh natural foods and secure homes in the face of rising energy costs and climate instability.  The desire to grow at home is limited by access to land, education and the tools to get started.  Our homes provide an affordable ready-to-operate package for young families, elderly residences, and displaced people; which can be expanded and combined into operating farm communities.  






Our Beautiful Location 

  The Fuji Eco Park Village is on Mt Fuji, 2hrs from downtown Tokyo. The 5 acre permaculture landscape with ponds,sheep and herb gardens surrounds an impressive Minka center house and various innovative eco-buildings and electric vehicles, powered 100% by solar pv and wind. The park hosts yoga-detox workshops, internships, weddings and events. 

Our Plan  -  Building the Demo

With your help, we will complete the first Eden Grow Home this year in Japan as a demonstration and educational model. Fuji Eco Park's Imai-san has donated land and an insulated container. We have started framing out the greenhouse and decks and the steel pipe arch is coming into place. We are shooting for a initial prototype cost of $28,000.  Your participation can help us hit our mark!

Who We Are 


     

The Earth Embassy team of architects, farmers, and eco-tech guys have been building homes, foods and community together since 2000.  The Solar Cafe & Farm is our farm-to-table education center where we've hosted students and guests from over 40 countries.  Our Lake Shojiko Village revitalization project restores antique minka homes for new families, with mentions in WSJ , Bloomberg.  Fuji Eco Park Village founder Imai-san is our gifted engineer; a permaculture specialist and a race winning EV car builder. Designer Jacob Reiner's Aquaponics House design received the 2012 Japan Eco Cup Award.  Our crew extends to NY and Africa too, where Jajja's Kids are housing and schooling 14 boys and looking for land for us to build the boys a sustainable farmstead.

Our goals

Our target is to be able deliver them globally for under $30,000. We are pretty good at building, now we are learning how to build light and manage the shipping process....
 As we reach the start-up goal with this campaign, we'll look to start Phase 2 and raise funds to send an Eden Farm Home to the orphans at Jajja's Kids in Uganda where our adopted brother Ronnie is teaching the kids to grow food.

<p>SKE Labs is the
company behind Neo.  Founded by engineer
and food lover Madhuri Eunni, SKE is short for Smart Kitchen Ecosystem. 
We are a small (but fierce) team working out of the MaRS innovation center in Toronto. <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1213086/files/20150210204106-t2.jpg?1423629666"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/><br/></p>
<p>For Madhuri what started as a personal challenge to get more
natural protein in her daily diet quickly turned into a smart kitchen solution
that all her friends wanted and the idea for Neo was born.  In the months to follow Madhuri pulled together
a team of talented and passionate designers, engineers and foodies to build
the first ever smart jar. After several trials and 3D prototypes, Neo was launched successfully
at CES 2015. Highlight of the event - we
made it to NBC Top 10 Fun &amp; Futuristic Gadgets. Thank you for the honor!<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1213087/files/20150210204120-t3.jpg?1423629680"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With years of experience in building cool products, our team is ready to manufacture Neo in the next few months.  We carefully selected trusted partners who
bring only the highest quality and best manufacturing standards to build Neo. They helped us create our current prototypes.
That means we are confident of the manufacturing process and timelines. <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1213088/files/20150210204135-t4.jpg?1423629695"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<br/><p>We’re excited to bring Neo to the Indiegogo community! We want
you to try it, let us know what we can make even better and join us in this
incredible journey. Together we’ll
revolutionize the kitchen into the new connected heart of a home.</p>

SKE Labs is the
company behind Neo.  Founded by engineer
and food lover Madhuri Eunni, SKE is short for Smart Kitchen Ecosystem. 
We are a small (but fierce) team working out of the MaRS innovation center in Toronto. 

For Madhuri what started as a personal challenge to get more
natural protein in her daily diet quickly turned into a smart kitchen solution
that all her friends wanted and the idea for Neo was born.  In the months to follow Madhuri pulled together
a team of talented and passionate designers, engineers and foodies to build
the first ever smart jar. After several trials and 3D prototypes, Neo was launched successfully
at CES 2015. Highlight of the event - we
made it to NBC Top 10 Fun & Futuristic Gadgets. Thank you for the honor!

With years of experience in building cool products, our team is ready to manufacture Neo in the next few months.  We carefully selected trusted partners who
bring only the highest quality and best manufacturing standards to build Neo. They helped us create our current prototypes.
That means we are confident of the manufacturing process and timelines. 

We’re excited to bring Neo to the Indiegogo community! We want
you to try it, let us know what we can make even better and join us in this
incredible journey. Together we’ll
revolutionize the kitchen into the new connected heart of a home.

<p><b>The ThinkPillow Story</b></p>
<p>Why did I want to invent the ThinkPillow? To begin with my father, he often slept badly at night because of his cervical spondylosis. From research, I found that my father had been using a bad pillow for sleeping, which led to the injury of his spine. So I decided to make a special pillow that would be conducive to my fathers sleep.</p>
<p>After two years of hard work, I finally managed to invent a pillow that is the ThinkPillow, as we called it. I gave the ThinkPillow to my father as a gift on his birthday, from there on in, dad's sleep problem was solved.</p>
<p>Then I realized that there are a lot of people with sleep woes like my father in the world, so I continued to develop the ThinkPillow to create a product that could help anyone achieve a good nights rest.</p>
<p><b>Next Steps</b></p>
<p>The molds of the system's parts have been built and we have completed product and software application development and testing. We are now ready for mass production, but the factory needs a minimum order quantity to produce, so we come to Indiegogo to ask for help. We hope you believe in the benefit of the ThinkPillow enough to support us, so we can help to change the way we sleep forever.</p>
<p><b>Only The Best Quality</b></p>
<p>The ThinkPillow team has been working in the industrial manufacturing with global corporations for more than 10 years and we have deep experience in bringing innovative, successful products to market.</p>
<p>We have already invested one year of research to ensure the very best materials and the most innovative, compatible design.</p>
<p>The vast majority of our raw materials for the  ThinkPillow have been imported from USA, Germany and Japan. Such as the filling micro-balls , button balls as well as the airbag filling. Also we have 100% ensured they have met the highest level of international environmental standards, an absolute must for a product that serves such an intimate role.</p>
<p>Our staff will be stationed in the production outlets to monitor the assembly process, to ensure we deliver the highest quality products. We will then test, one by one, with a 3rd party quality control and compliance house to ensure each product passes the most stringent standards before it leaves the factory.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p></p>
<p>ThinkPillow is a little more complicated than an average adjustable pillow. As it is composed of several parts, these components are produced in separate factories and therefore the foremost consideration is production management and quality assurance between the locations. <br/><br/>Particular attention is required to ensure quality control for the production of the ThinkPillows key components. Our staff will be stationed on site at these locations to ensure consistent standards of manufacturing and our 48 hour test cycle policy.</p>
<p>Naturally there will always be risks in any venture; however by implementing stringent production safeguards and conducting a deep level of research, we've dramatically reduced these risks by developing a reliably manufactured product that will actually revolutionize your sleep (and more importantly waking) experience! On top of this, we are 100% committed to our product and are ready to address any possible issues that may come our way.</p>

Why did I want to invent the ThinkPillow? To begin with my father, he often slept badly at night because of his cervical spondylosis. From research, I found that my father had been using a bad pillow for sleeping, which led to the injury of his spine. So I decided to make a special pillow that would be conducive to my fathers sleep.
After two years of hard work, I finally managed to invent a pillow that is the ThinkPillow, as we called it. I gave the ThinkPillow to my father as a gift on his birthday, from there on in, dad's sleep problem was solved.
Then I realized that there are a lot of people with sleep woes like my father in the world, so I continued to develop the ThinkPillow to create a product that could help anyone achieve a good nights rest.
Next Steps
The molds of the system's parts have been built and we have completed product and software application development and testing. We are now ready for mass production, but the factory needs a minimum order quantity to produce, so we come to Indiegogo to ask for help. We hope you believe in the benefit of the ThinkPillow enough to support us, so we can help to change the way we sleep forever.
Only The Best Quality
The ThinkPillow team has been working in the industrial manufacturing with global corporations for more than 10 years and we have deep experience in bringing innovative, successful products to market.
We have already invested one year of research to ensure the very best materials and the most innovative, compatible design.
The vast majority of our raw materials for the  ThinkPillow have been imported from USA, Germany and Japan. Such as the filling micro-balls , button balls as well as the airbag filling. Also we have 100% ensured they have met the highest level of international environmental standards, an absolute must for a product that serves such an intimate role.
Our staff will be stationed in the production outlets to monitor the assembly process, to ensure we deliver the highest quality products. We will then test, one by one, with a 3rd party quality control and compliance house to ensure each product passes the most stringent standards before it leaves the factory.

Risks and challenges

ThinkPillow is a little more complicated than an average adjustable pillow. As it is composed of several parts, these components are produced in separate factories and therefore the foremost consideration is production management and quality assurance between the locations. Particular attention is required to ensure quality control for the production of the ThinkPillows key components. Our staff will be stationed on site at these locations to ensure consistent standards of manufacturing and our 48 hour test cycle policy.
Naturally there will always be risks in any venture; however by implementing stringent production safeguards and conducting a deep level of research, we've dramatically reduced these risks by developing a reliably manufactured product that will actually revolutionize your sleep (and more importantly waking) experience! On top of this, we are 100% committed to our product and are ready to address any possible issues that may come our way.",19.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p> </p></figure></div><p>A little over 3 years ago, Thorben and Nadine had a dream: to grow tasty heirloom tomatoes on their little balcony in their apartment in Singapore.</p><p>The high prices of imported fresh produce and concerns about pesticides inspired them to grow their own food at home, but the problem of space in an urban environment quickly became an issue. </p><p>Another challenge was to keep the plants alive when they went away on business trips or holidays. After failing countless times with soil gardens, they devised a vertical hydroponic system that would automatically water and fertilize the plants. Despite their hectic lifestyles, they were able to grow enough food without too much time or effort. Encouraged by this success, Thorben began developing the prototype systems further for commercialisation.</p><p>The goal was to come up with a food safe system and design that was functional and looked chic on any urban city balcony. Twelve months of 3D prototyping ensued, which led to the invention of a sleek, modular, simple to assemble and easy to maintain vertical gardening system that fits in the smallest of spaces.</p><p>The company has since sold over 1500 gardening systems in Singapore and the region, Europe, Australia and the Middle East. But not every climate is suited for year round growing. Singapore’s tropical downpours and blazing humidity can be tough to grow certain greens, so in December 2017 they decided to develop an indoor version of the system that would allow the Aerospring to grow anything, anywhere, anytime.</p><p>Aerospring Gardens’ goal is to provide the best growing experience possible, to allow people to take back control over their food, to reconnect with it and truly experience the joy of growing their own food, right at home.</p><div data-id=""24012934""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1552669849/uv9iisg2uldhzd9ufy8w.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""24001312""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div><div data-id=""24012885""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1552669852/xbptcp1np2xywmwvae1x.png"" src="""" style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>

 The Aerospring gardening system uses aeroponics, a process in which plants are grown by having their roots suspended in air and regularly showering them with a nutrient-rich water solution. There’s no need to weed or toil any soil, and there’s much less threat from pests because the system is completely soil-less.Seedlings are started in a hydroponic grow medium called rockwool, which is derived from basalt rock. It retains plenty of water but still provides the roots with enough oxygen to develop into healthy and strong plants. You can germinate your own seedlings with the grow cubes provided or buy some at your local garden centre. 
 
 The Aerospring garden features a sleek hexagonal pole design that fits in any small apartment, home or balcony, using only 10 square feet, or one square meter, of space. It’s the most efficient way to grow up to 27 plants in a small space.The Aerospring Indoor highlights the hexagonal shape in the grow tent, integrating six powerful triple-band LED grow lights. The tent can be left entirely open or completely closed in seconds. It illuminates a dark corner of your home, providing an oasis of greenery and the scent of fresh herbs in winter months. The garden is on wheels, so it can easily be moved around or put into any spare room.Assembling your Aerospring is simple (it takes just fifteen minutes) with no additional tools required. Adding on your Indoor kit is just as easy and can be done in less than an hour.
 Because the Aerospring Garden automates irrigation and lighting schedules, there’s very little time and effort required to maintain the garden. But to ensure the very best results, set aside 5 minutes every couple of days to tend to the garden. These few minutes should be used to check plants and to trim away older leaves. You will also need to check on the water and nutrient levels every so often and top them up when necessary. Most people do this about once a week. Harvest plants regularly -- pinch and prune the top tips so that they grow more efficiently, but above all, experience the joy of effortless gardening in your own home! Grow an abundance (up to 15lbs/7kg) of fresh, nutritious pesticide-free produce every month(*actual yield depends on plants grown).
 The outdoor Aerospring grows almost anything except root vegetables and trees.The indoor system is ideal for salads, herbs and other leafy greens providing fresh, pesticide-free produce right at home. It can even be customized to grow a few larger plants, like tomatoes, or any other crop that captures your fancy.With the addition of the Aerospring Indoor accessory kit, the Aerospring Garden functions as a 2-in-1 system - grow larger plants outdoors from spring through autumn, then add the indoor accessory kit to be able to grow in your home during the winter and colder months. It’s efficient, easy to set up and tear down, mobile and incredibly productive. It’s the most versatile gardening system - use it outdoors or indoors, grow as few or as many plants as you’d like. Grow all year round.
   
  
 Your Aerospring consists of a 20 gallon, or 75 liter, bucket, a lid for the bucket with a small service port, nine hexagonal planter sections, a shower head with lid, nine water pipe conduits and a water pump with a hose and connectors.Your Indoor kit includes six patented professional LED grow light bars, a fan, a lightweight aluminium wheelbase and frame, a grow tent with six zippable panels and Wi-Fi timers.The LED grow light bars are like no other - the supplied bars produce the equivalent of 1000W but only consume 138W of electricity. Triple-Band LED technology produces a full-spectrum light to ensure that your plants receive full PAR spectrum which supports healthy vegetation. Patented, novel, single-chip architecture diodes emit blue, green, and red (BGR) bandwidths, full Photosynthetically Active Radiation (400nm to 700nm) for maximum plant yield, while keeping power consumption low.Super slim and lightweight with a long life expectancy (50,000 hours), they pack a powerful punch to the Aerospring Indoor gardening system.  
 
 A little over 3 years ago, Thorben and Nadine had a dream: to grow tasty heirloom tomatoes on their little balcony in their apartment in Singapore.The high prices of imported fresh produce and concerns about pesticides inspired them to grow their own food at home, but the problem of space in an urban environment quickly became an issue. Another challenge was to keep the plants alive when they went away on business trips or holidays. After failing countless times with soil gardens, they devised a vertical hydroponic system that would automatically water and fertilize the plants. Despite their hectic lifestyles, they were able to grow enough food without too much time or effort. Encouraged by this success, Thorben began developing the prototype systems further for commercialisation.The goal was to come up with a food safe system and design that was functional and looked chic on any urban city balcony. Twelve months of 3D prototyping ensued, which led to the invention of a sleek, modular, simple to assemble and easy to maintain vertical gardening system that fits in the smallest of spaces.The company has since sold over 1500 gardening systems in Singapore and the region, Europe, Australia and the Middle East. But not every climate is suited for year round growing. Singapore’s tropical downpours and blazing humidity can be tough to grow certain greens, so in December 2017 they decided to develop an indoor version of the system that would allow the Aerospring to grow anything, anywhere, anytime.Aerospring Gardens’ goal is to provide the best growing experience possible, to allow people to take back control over their food, to reconnect with it and truly experience the joy of growing their own food, right at home.

<p>Did you find it too complicated to configure your thermostat and do you finally only switch between the day and night modes?</p><p><b>Forget about that! </b></p>
<p align=""justify"">With Snugr, using a user-friendly interface, you decide the temperature you want in each room... and you can have different plannings too. You can control your entire heating system from anywhere, at any time.</p>

<p></p>
<p align=""justify"">Simply ask Snugr: ""In the bathroom, on Saturday and Sunday, I want 21°C from 9 AM to 10 AM"" and Snugr will take care of it. Snugr learns the best time to start heating each room in order to get the right temperature at the right time.</p>

<h3><strong>More savings? How?</strong></h3>
<p align=""justify""><b>Smart heating:</b> As Snugr allows you to heat the rooms individually, you are not loosing money heating the entire house every time you need a warm room. You can have a warm bathroom a few hours in the morning without having to heat the whole house.</p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Forgetting is no longer a problem: </b>Snugr allows you to turn off the heaters from you smartphone. No worries if you are leaving sooner or if you forgot to think about the heaters when leaving for your job, for a dinner or for holidays.</p>

But more than anything else, we are waiting for your feedback to get new ideas!
More Comfort? How?
Before Snugr, we were frustrated because we managed all the heaters of our houses with one thermostat that was measuring the temperature in only one room.Did you ever feel too cold in your bathroom because you didn't want to heat the entire house during the night?

Are you also walking around the entire house, choosing between 1 to 5 on those 20th century heater valves, trying to get the right temperature in each room?

Did you find it too complicated to configure your thermostat and do you finally only switch between the day and night modes?Forget about that! 
With Snugr, using a user-friendly interface, you decide the temperature you want in each room... and you can have different plannings too. You can control your entire heating system from anywhere, at any time.



Simply ask Snugr: ""In the bathroom, on Saturday and Sunday, I want 21°C from 9 AM to 10 AM"" and Snugr will take care of it. Snugr learns the best time to start heating each room in order to get the right temperature at the right time.


Aren't your children living with you full time?Activate or deactivate a planning in a single click.Are you coming home sooner?Start heating when you are leaving the office!Are you going out with friends tonight and not coming home this evening?Turn off your heaters and save money!
More savings? How?
Smart heating: As Snugr allows you to heat the rooms individually, you are not loosing money heating the entire house every time you need a warm room. You can have a warm bathroom a few hours in the morning without having to heat the whole house.
Forgetting is no longer a problem: Snugr allows you to turn off the heaters from you smartphone. No worries if you are leaving sooner or if you forgot to think about the heaters when leaving for your job, for a dinner or for holidays.

Snugr's learning system: Snugr learns when it has to start heating to get the right temperature at the right time. This means the end of wasted energy because you started heating too early. Do you want 20°C at 8PM? With Snugr you get 20°C at 8PM, not at 8:45PM, nor at 7:30PM.
Boiler connexion: Snugr can replace your old thermostat and connect to your boiler to turn it off when no room is heating.

</div></div>","Who is Black Box?
We are Small Form Factor (SFF) PC enthusiasts that want a high quality CPU cooler that's effective and affordable.  Our design creates a better option than large, expensive water cooling units and combines the best characteristics from air coolers and closed loop radiators. We strive for perfection in design and function.
 
Why build the Black Box?
Computers perform better when they are cooler.  When running games, graphics or high-processing powered applications the stock fan/cooler just doesn't cut it.  For higher performance there are a number of after market options but after using and researching the existing optoins we believe a better CPU cooler can be created that is more effective and costs less. We set out to build something cooler, cheaper and easier to use!
We begin with an optimized design combing the best of water and air cooling. Then we execute using quality materials and precision-built fabrication. We have researched the current options on the market today including air cooled with heat pipes, closed-loop cooling and high-end water cooling (which cost hundreds and have high potential for leaks). Our design and approach addresses the following issues:

Hard to mount and weak plastic components.
Blocked Mother Board components and reduced air flow though the case.
Loud and annoying noises from fan and pump.
Coolers that are too large to fit in many cases.
If the pump fails the unit must be replaced so your computer is down.
If fan fails it cannot be replaced requiring replacement of entire cooler.
Inefficient use of fan and cooling system and/ or components.
Impractical design: to remove the cooler other components must be removed first.
Lack of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for controlling fan speed.

 
Why should you care?
By backing this project you can help us support a hyper-passionate PC building community and be part of developing an innovative product where previously there had been stagnation and lackluster results from large output manufacturers.
 
Black Box: A powerful, refined CPU cooler
The Black Box is a new CPU cooler that raises the bar in performance, versatility and design for the PC enthusiast as well as the novice. We combine the performance of water and air cooling in a compact maintenance-free design. It's easy to install and remove with an easy mount configuration. It's quality constructed with aircraft grade aluminum and pure copper. And, it's all wrapped in an elegant, minimalist beautiful aluminum finish exterior.
 
We've spent months perfecting the design using feedback from PC enthusiasts and KLW manufacturing engineers. Our goal is to take the design to production, and we need your help.
 
The next step before production is to test a prototype of the Black Box. The funding goal is the minimum we need to produce a prototype plus the equipment to test fitment, thermals and noise.
 
The purpose of this initial funding round is to test and make the necessary revisions to maximize efficiency and performance while minimizing costs. The more funding we're able to raise, the more hardware configurations we'll be able to test for, which will lead to a better product. So if we achieve our funding goal, don't let it stop you from backing us! Every little bit helps make the Black Box better.
 
Once we've completed the prototype and testing phase, the next step will be a limited production run funded via a second crowd funding campaign. And if you're wondering, based on our analysis, the estimated retail price of the Black Box will be USD $69-89.
 
Funding Allocation:
USD  2000   All machined and water cut parts
USD    300   Copper Coils
USD    400   Testing Equipment
Indiegogo + Bank transfer fee cost 10% of funding

<h1>About Sinemems</h1>
<p>Naushad Hossain founded Sinemems.  He received his BS in Aerospace Engineering and MS in Civil Engineering specialized in Micro Electromechanical Sensor (MEMS) structures from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He has 12 years experience in designing automotive airbag sensors and pressure sensors. He has a patent on automotive side impact airbag sensor and his US patent number is 5538099. Naushad has experience in taking several automotive sensor projects from design stage to production.</p>
<h1>What have we done so far?</h1>
<p>We have developed prototypes that are now working according to our specifications.  What you have seen on the video are the working prototypes.  For past several months we have been testing several components of the tablets to ensure quality and reliability.  Most of these components are proven and have field data available because they are currently being used in other manufacturers' tablets.  For electronic products quality and reliability does not only depend on the design and the components of the products but also depend on the production process.  Making few prototypes does not mean that you are ready for mass production.  A proven production process is needed to ensure quality and reliability of the product.  That's why we have selected a factory in China who is currently making tablets for other manufacturers.  They are well experienced in tablet manufacturing.  We are now ready to manufacture these tablets in volume.</p>
<h1>Why do we need your help?</h1>
<p>We have turned to Indiegogo to help us to fund our first production run.  Your support will help us to make these tablets in volume.  We also need your help to spread the word about our tablets.</p>
<h1>What's next?</h1>
<p>When it comes to production not everything work as planned.  That's why we have the following conservative schedule for the next few months:</p>
<p>March 2013: Do production test run and validate the process.</p>
<p>April 2013: Order materials and get certification.</p>
<p>May 2013: Start volume production.</p>
<p>June 2013: Start shipping Sinemems tablets to our backers.</p>

We have developed prototypes that are now working according to our specifications.  What you have seen on the video are the working prototypes.  For past several months we have been testing several components of the tablets to ensure quality and reliability.  Most of these components are proven and have field data available because they are currently being used in other manufacturers' tablets.  For electronic products quality and reliability does not only depend on the design and the components of the products but also depend on the production process.  Making few prototypes does not mean that you are ready for mass production.  A proven production process is needed to ensure quality and reliability of the product.  That's why we have selected a factory in China who is currently making tablets for other manufacturers.  They are well experienced in tablet manufacturing.  We are now ready to manufacture these tablets in volume.
Why do we need your help?
We have turned to Indiegogo to help us to fund our first production run.  Your support will help us to make these tablets in volume.  We also need your help to spread the word about our tablets.
What's next?
When it comes to production not everything work as planned.  That's why we have the following conservative schedule for the next few months:
March 2013: Do production test run and validate the process.
April 2013: Order materials and get certification.
May 2013: Start volume production.
June 2013: Start shipping Sinemems tablets to our backers.

This technology enlarges the screen to the entire room  by projecting a glow of light from all four sides of the back of the screen onto the surrounding wall. It's especially great for enhancing a 3D experience. AmbiVision supports all screen sizes up to 120 inches diagonally and captures the screen from all HDMI devices.Compare the difference - This shows how AmbiVision can simply extend your screen . We are happy to introduce AmbiVision PRO. It is the first ambient lighting system that is able to capture a TV or monitor screen directly regardless of the video source.It is a fresh solution invented by our second R&D team.  The end effect, AmbiVision’s modes and features are the same or better (for example the wall adaptive feature doesn’t need user configuration), but thanks to the fast fisheye camera, we can capture TV every screen with 60 FPS, analyze the screen edges and send it wirelessly to  the LED strip!You just need to place the controller somewhere with max 5 meters distance. It will automatically pair with the LED strip and find your screen where the LED strip is placed.It's how the AmbiVision PRO worksThe LED strip is equipped with a small controller to drive the LED strip remotely. Data speed is about 1Mbps, so it can refresh the LED strip 125 per second for 250 LEDs RGBW strip (1.000.000/(32b*250)) without noticeable delay.The controller based on 4x 1.6 GHz core  to fast capturing and analyzing a screen content.  An infrared sensor and BT&WiFi b/g/n module allow to control AmbiVision PRO by your own remote control or Smartphone App.  Additionally, we’ll add support for Philips Hue and other similar solutions as well as simple API for advanced users..The AmbiVision PRO controller can be placed near of the TV, or somewhere else. Thanks to 174 degrees fisheye camera the device can capture the screen in almost all places in room and viewing angle isn't relevant.Comparison between the competitors solution and AmbiVision PRO How to update AmbiVision to the PRO?We’ve created the AmbiVision PRO UPDATE for $29 exclusively for Indiegogo backers, so anyone who ordered a perk with controller included just need to choose the PRO update perk to receive the latest AmbiVision release.If you are a new backer, you need to order AmbiVision 4K first, then order the PRO update perk. Sorry, Indiegogo does not provide multi-purchase.Do we need more time to deliver AmbiVision PRO?No, we are sure that we can do that as written on the timeline. We do not need to start from scratch. We have selected ready-to-buy components, so we can focus only on software development. Safely spend more time with your favorite screen content! People spend about 34 hours a week watching TV and much more while working on the computer. During dark to bright scene changes, the pupil of the eye reacts by decreasing its’ diameter twice within 5 seconds for better eye protection.When the scene changes from bright to dark, your pupil needs to increase its diameter up to 180 seconds for clearer vision in the dark. In every movie, scenes switch from dark to bright hundreds of times, resulting is that the muscles of your eyes are in constant tension which can lead to vision impairment.Minimum luminosity level decreases contrast between wall and screen content to let your eyes relax.With AmbiVision, the muscles of your eyes are less strained, so your eyes don't get tired while spending long periods of time in front of the screen. Rock, classic, jazz? With AmbiVision, your music sounds better. Liven up your parties by making the beats match the visual effects.  Thanks to 5 years of experience, we developed a self-adjusting system to enhance your visual experience and avoid configuration setup. The device analyzes video content and adjusts capturing properties automatically.For example, games require fast changes and are more dynamic, so AmbiVision boosts speed and increases colors. Dramas have statistically less fast changes than games, thus AmbiVision  adds more smoothing and increases minimum luminosity level to be more relaxed.A high-performance DSP chip analyzes video stream in real time. We use this feature to recognize black bars while watching movies and automatically adjust capturing areas.Thanks to a wall-adaptive feature, the color of the light is perfectly aligned with the screen picture, regardless of the wall color.If you want to control all the features by yourself, you can use your own remote control and pair with AmbiVision. The device captures information exchanges between your TV and your HDMI devices (CEC technology). You can set the device up to take this information into account (for example, TV shutdown causes entering in low power mode of the AmbiVision contoller or use teletext buttons to change AmbiVision modes remotely). We updated the AmbiVision 4K to use the latest SK6812 LED Strip. It provides two times faster data speed (so there’s no noticeable delay between end and beginning of LED strip) with better colors. However, AmbiVision can handle previous technologies too, so it still works with older LED strip types.AmbiVision 4K supports RGB as well as RGB+White LED strips to provide excellent colors.We do not use downscaling of video images, thus we can get extremely precise colors. AmbiVision does not split the image to specific number of zones and then fit the zones to the LED count. Every single LED means single parts of screen, creating a more dynamic and natural effect.  Installation for the AmbiVision is simple and takes only 6-8 minutes depending on your screen size. The self-adhesive RGB LED strip is only 10 mm wide, and is flexible and bendable. You can stick it to the 4 sides of your screen and bend it at the edges easily or use connection corners.The adhesive material on the strip is good quality and reusable. You can remove it and transfer the strip to another monitor.Then connect your HDMI device (HD-player, Slingbox, Nexus Player,  DVD or Bluray Player, XBox, PlayStation, Nintendo WiiU, Roku, Comcast, DirectTV, Time Warner Cable, Xfinity, Dish Network, Verizon FiOS, Satellite, Laptop, ChromeCast, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, PC, Mac, etc.)  into AmbiVision and you’re ready to enjoy it.The LED numbers are automatically calculated when you turn on the device so you don’t need to set up the controller. However, if you want to check all features, you can still use the AmbiVision Wizard (available for MAC, Linux, Windows) and adjust the advanced settings.The first AmbiVision had all connectivity features outside. We sold about 5k product all over the World and reached $115.000 on our crowdfunding campaign.  We were the first company which made HDMI connection possible, but now external stuff is no longer needed.Together with a Chinese integrated circuits manufacturer, we developed a special 4K chip to replace all connectivity stuff with one piece of silicon.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">MEET VILFO</h2>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.vilfo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vilfo</a> is a smart network router where VPN is the main feature instead of an afterthought. All devices in your network are protected automatically and Vilfo's powerful hardware allows encryption speeds up to 600 Mbit/s.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Vilfo works with all VPN providers and a bunch are already pre-integrated and can be enabled with a single click. Furthermore, Vilfo supports using multiple VPN providers and VPN connections simultaneously.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We're so sure that you'll love Vilfo, that we offer returns within 14 days if you don't love it.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">WHAT IT DOES</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519804983/izgvjqgrss7kjl8xdoxz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Vilfo allows you to organise devices in your network into groups. Groups enable you to decide exactly which VPN server the devices in the group should be connected to. By doing so, you get full control of each device, without installing any software on it. Regardless of why you use a VPN, Vilfo is here to make your life easier.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519634567/nny5jewauoq8zzcrcczc.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Privacy online</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">VPN providers limit the number of simultaneous connections you may utilize, meaning you can only protect a couple of your devices at the same time. With Vilfo, each group will count as one connection - independent of how many devices you have in that group.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Furthermore, using Vilfo's killswitch, you can be calm knowing that no traffic will escape if the VPN connection is lost.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519634084/miyw155gxrnogprhl5r2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Access blocked content</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Do you live abroad and want to access the streaming services in your country? Or do you want to access streaming services that aren't available in your country?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">No problem. Using Vilfo, you can finally watch your desired content on any device - even those that natively don't support VPN connections. Your AppleTV, Chromecast and Smart TV can finally be used so the people in your household don't need to squeeze together infront of a small laptop.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519634605/zdsvbs3krhoesenhxnjy.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Ease of use</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Instead of being forced to install software on all your devices — and handle any potential disconnects on all devices — you can control everything in one place.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">You can literally set and forget Vilfo since it automatically protects all new devices in your network and reconnects automatically if the connection is lost.</p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A bunch of VPN Providers are pre-integrated</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Over 40 OpenVPN providers have asked to be integrated into Vilfo. If you have a subscription with one of them, activation in Vilfo is a single click away.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">First of all a huge thank you for supporting our campaign and helping us reach the funding goal so fast! It took less than 24 hours to reach our goal, and we’re at 180% funding now.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We’re gazing forward and looking for ways to reach even more people with our campaign and how we can improve Vilfo even more for you.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>200% funding - Bandwidth limitations (QoS)</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Make sure no unnecessary devices are hogging your bandwidth. Set bandwidth limitations on devices in your network. Bandwidth limitations can be set on a group - or on individual devices.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">If you set a limitation on a group, all devices in that group can simultaneously only use the bandwidth allocated. But you can also set limitations for a specific devices - which means that other devices in the same group can still use as much bandwidth as they want. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>300% funding - Add support for Wireguard</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Vilfo currently only supports OpenVPN. When reaching 300% funding, we'll include functionality for Wireguard - enabling even faster speeds. Wireguard is an up-and-coming VPN protocol, known for it's efficiency, security and speed.  </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>400% funding - Deep packet inspection</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">With deep packet inspection, you can get even better insights into your network. See how much bandwidth is consumed for a variety of different media - as well as what each device in your network is actually up to.</p>

</div></div>","MEET VILFO
 
Vilfo is a smart network router where VPN is the main feature instead of an afterthought. All devices in your network are protected automatically and Vilfo's powerful hardware allows encryption speeds up to 600 Mbit/s.
Vilfo works with all VPN providers and a bunch are already pre-integrated and can be enabled with a single click. Furthermore, Vilfo supports using multiple VPN providers and VPN connections simultaneously.
We're so sure that you'll love Vilfo, that we offer returns within 14 days if you don't love it.
 
WHAT IT DOES

 
HOW IT WORKS
 
Vilfo allows you to organise devices in your network into groups. Groups enable you to decide exactly which VPN server the devices in the group should be connected to. By doing so, you get full control of each device, without installing any software on it. Regardless of why you use a VPN, Vilfo is here to make your life easier.
 

Privacy online
VPN providers limit the number of simultaneous connections you may utilize, meaning you can only protect a couple of your devices at the same time. With Vilfo, each group will count as one connection - independent of how many devices you have in that group.
Furthermore, using Vilfo's killswitch, you can be calm knowing that no traffic will escape if the VPN connection is lost.
 

Access blocked content
Do you live abroad and want to access the streaming services in your country? Or do you want to access streaming services that aren't available in your country?
No problem. Using Vilfo, you can finally watch your desired content on any device - even those that natively don't support VPN connections. Your AppleTV, Chromecast and Smart TV can finally be used so the people in your household don't need to squeeze together infront of a small laptop.
 

Ease of use
Instead of being forced to install software on all your devices — and handle any potential disconnects on all devices — you can control everything in one place.
You can literally set and forget Vilfo since it automatically protects all new devices in your network and reconnects automatically if the connection is lost.

 
A bunch of VPN Providers are pre-integrated
Over 40 OpenVPN providers have asked to be integrated into Vilfo. If you have a subscription with one of them, activation in Vilfo is a single click away.
 

 
Multiple simultaneous VPN connections
Decide exactly which devices in your network should be connected to which VPN provider and server.
 

 
Over 200 people already use Vilfo
Vilfo has been in beta since November 2017 and over 200 people have participated and helped us make Vilfo what it is today. Here's what some of them have to say.
 
 
 
""Vilfo is the first solution that makes VPN usable for an average user like me. The possibility to combine different VPN providers and the ability to use bypass rules for those sites where you don't want to use it, all in a graphical interface that is easy to understand yet powerful.""
- Peder B.
 
 
 
""I've been using Vilfo for a few months now and I love the simplicity. The GUI is responsive, clean, neat and modern and it provides plenty of functionality to protect my devices and to keep my children in check with it's Parental Controls. Vilfo is stable, and informative so you get to see what devices are connected and whether they are protected or not. 
You can easily sort the devices into groups to have fine grained control over them. When things do go wrong, support is never far away and always responsive and personal. I can highly recommend this as a great product!""
- Niall B.
 
 
 
""Really enjoy Vilfo. Great interface, easy to use and works great. Much more comfortable to protect all devices at home than using an app on each device.""
- Tomasz L.
 
 
 
""Vilfo is clearly created by passion. It is, in my opinion, the best VPN solution today which clearly matches the definition of a great idea put together by passionate smart people. If you were curious enough to follow their journey you can see they went above and beyond in terms of hard work and quality. 
Passionate people, great hardware with the Vilfo router, ingenious software with a very nice user interface & browser extension. In addition it’s amazing to see that things are kept open in terms of choice for the VPN provider you want to use. And to conclude, they have the best real human support I’ve ever encountered on the Internet up to this day.""
- Alex S.
 
 
 
""I've been using Vilfo for a few months now without a single issue. It was easy to setup, easy to maintain and super easy to understand. The team behind it sends updates frequently and are very transparent with what the updates includes. Very professional bunch of people.""
 
- Simon U.
 
 
 
""Vilfo is truly a next generation home router solution for the security minded.
Not only is the new Vilfo product awesome, the team behind the product provides outstanding customer service and pride in what they deliver to their customers.""
 
- Lars L.
 
 
 
Get alerts for key events in your network
Receive email or push notifications for key events in your network - even if you're not there. 
 

 
Real-time bandwidth for groups and devices
Someone hogging your bandwidth? Or do you want to see what your IoT devices are doing? Vilfo provides real time bandwidth information for each device in the network, as well as aggregated bandwidth data for groups.
 

 
Vilfo vs. Ordinary router
There are multiple key differences when comparing Vilfo to ordinary routers.
 

 
Three LAN ports
Vilfo provides three LAN ports to enable you to connect access points and IoT devices via an ethernet cable.
 

 
Insights
Know what goes on in your network - in real time as well as historically. Vilfo gives you the information, whenever you want it.
 

 
Instant overview of your network
Vilfo's dashboard shows you how much traffic goes over a VPN vs. your ordinary ISP, the latency to gateways, as well as device information.
 

 
Even works if your VPN Provider isn't integrated
Vilfo has a bunch of integrated providers that are easy to use. But Vilfo works with any provider. Just upload the VPN providers OpenVPN configuration files and you're good to go.
 

 
Cooling
We've stressed Vilfo's heat tolerance to the extremes. It has multiple well-designed ventilation shafts in key areas to enable cooling which means you can mount it on a wall or let it stand on a table and it won't overheat. 
 

 
Production ready
Over 200 beta testers have helped us refine the software so far. We've already ordered the materials needed for production and assembly is taking place in March and April.
 

 
Browser extension to bypass/force VPN for websites
Empower your devices. Using the extension, each device can force VPN usage for a website or bypass the VPN for it. 
 

 
Hardware specs
Vilfo can encrypt VPN traffic up to 600 Mbit/s. The wifi can transmit data up to 867 Mbit/s and the wireless antennas are 8 dBi.
 


 
STRETCH GOALS
 
First of all a huge thank you for supporting our campaign and helping us reach the funding goal so fast! It took less than 24 hours to reach our goal, and we’re at 180% funding now.
We’re gazing forward and looking for ways to reach even more people with our campaign and how we can improve Vilfo even more for you.
 

200% funding - Bandwidth limitations (QoS)
Make sure no unnecessary devices are hogging your bandwidth. Set bandwidth limitations on devices in your network. Bandwidth limitations can be set on a group - or on individual devices.
If you set a limitation on a group, all devices in that group can simultaneously only use the bandwidth allocated. But you can also set limitations for a specific devices - which means that other devices in the same group can still use as much bandwidth as they want. 
 

250% funding - Access your home network from anywhere
Connect to your home network from wherever you are. This stretch goal includes us building VPN server functionality - allowing you or other users to access your home network from any location. 
 

300% funding - Add support for Wireguard
Vilfo currently only supports OpenVPN. When reaching 300% funding, we'll include functionality for Wireguard - enabling even faster speeds. Wireguard is an up-and-coming VPN protocol, known for it's efficiency, security and speed.  
 

400% funding - Deep packet inspection
With deep packet inspection, you can get even better insights into your network. See how much bandwidth is consumed for a variety of different media - as well as what each device in your network is actually up to.
 
Videos
 
By organizing devices into groups you get full control of how each device should be protected by a VPN connection or not.
 

 
Ensure a lag-free gaming experience even though your devices are connected to a VPN server. Vilfo allows you to bypass the VPN connection for specific IP addresses or ports, allowing you to still be connected to your VPN server while gaming.
 

 
Watch geo-restricted content on any device in your network, even those that natively don't support VPN connections. By using Vilfo, you can give your AppleTV an IP address in the US to access Netflix, your iPad an IP address in England to access BBC iPlayer, and your TV an IP address in Norway.
All at the same time.

Happy Thanksgiving!!  Cool drinks down quicker than you can heat them up!The Coldwave is the quickest and easiest way to chill any temperature beverage to under 38F (3C) in about a minute, while having no impact on the flavor or dilution. Now you have the ability to make great tasting ice coffee (using any blend), ice tea, wine, martinis and other cold beverages at home, without sacrificing time and taste.  Features:
Steaming hot to ice cold in about a minute
Room temp. to ice cold in about 30 seconds
12 oz. fluid capacity
Preserves freshly brewed flavor
No dilution, consistent taste
Designed to fit your single cup coffee maker
Cools 2 hot beverages or 6 at room temperature before refreezing
Stores in freezer, refreezes quickly

BPA-Free
100% safe, contains purified water
Manufactured in the U.S.A.
Patent pending
 Size:
Smaller than a quart of ice cream
Diameter:        4.75 in (120 mm)
Height:           5.3 in (134.6 mm)
Capacity:        12 oz. (355 ml) 
Empty weight: 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kgs)
  Pays for itself many times over:A regular coffee drinker could save $1000 / year if they switched from retail coffee to the Coldwave today. The average cup of iced coffee at retail is over $2.50, while the cost of making it at home is about 50 cents, providing a savings of $2.00 per cup. Priced at retail for $40, the payback time is 20 days.
Simple and easy to use:Just pour in, wait about a minute, and pour out. Has the cooling capacity to chill two 16oz cups of hot coffee or 3 bottles of wine. 
  
How Does it Work?The Coldwave's revolutionary design cools beverages fast by spreading the hot beverage into a thin layer over a large area of ice. By increasing surface area and decreasing the thickness of the beverage layer, cooling time is dramatically reduced. Dilution is avoided by sealing ice in channels.  How does the Coldwave compare?Cooling with ice dilutes the beverage and changes its flavor. Perks:$1 - Backer: Every bit of funding helps! By being a Backer you're not just helping us make the Coldwave a reality you'll also be involved in our entrepreneurial journey with regular updates and an inside look at our progress.$20 - Coldwave T-shirt: You've got our back, so we've got yours.  Get everything a Backer gets plus an awesome Coldwave T-shirt.  Made from high quality 100% cotton.$35 - Early Adopter (Limited Quantity): One ""Investor Series"" Coldwave with Free Shipping anywhere in the continental US!

Free shipping anywhere in the continental US. Add $20 for international shipments.  Use of funds:Over the past 2 years we have been designing, prototyping, testing, and optimizing the Coldwave to get it to where it is today. We have lined up manufacturers in the US to help us mass produce Coldwaves and begin saving the world from over-priced iced coffee.  Crowdfunding is an important step to help us pay for the high-precision tooling (expensive) required to manufacture the Coldwave and our initial purchase order costs to bring the Coldwave to market.  It also reduces financing requirements which will keep our overhead costs down and will help keep manufacturing of the Coldwave in the USA.Please help us achieve this goal by ordering one or more Coldwaves today and sharing our product with your friends, family, and drinking buddies!  Use the Indiegogo share tools, above, to spread the word.  Schedule*:*Expected. (We need your help to make it happen! Support us now!) About UsThe creation of IceColdNow (parent company of the Coldwave) was inspired by Dave Dussault, a coffee loving engineer with a background in heat transfer, who was tired of inconsistent, diluted, ice coffee that took a long time to make so he decided to do something about it. He developed the Coldwave through a number of design iterations and prototypes, and filed a patent. Finally, he assembled a team to assure the success of the Coldwave by IceColdNow. Frequently Asked QuestionsSafety
▶ Is the plastic BPA free?
Yes, the plastic we use is BPA free and is the same kind that's found in ice cube trays and baby's bottle.
▶ What liquid is sealed inside the Coldwave?
We seal 100% safe purified water inside the Coldwave. 
General
▶ Is it easy to clean?
Yes, the Coldwave can be easily separated into two components and rinsed out with water. We recommend washing it by hand / rinsing out right after use, to save yourself the time of refreezing the Coldwave.
▶ Will my beverage freeze if I forget to pour out my beverage after the recommended cooling time?
No, it’ll just be really really cold. You’re welcome.
▶ Can the starting temperature of the beverage be too hot?
Nope, bring it on.
▶ How will I know when my beverage is cold?
Wait at least 90 seconds and it will be cold.
▶ Do I have to change out the water sealed inside the Coldwave?
Nope, just let it do its thing.
▶ Can I drink straight from the Coldwave?
Sure, go for it, but it’s probably more comfortable to drink out of the appropriate cup, glass, or mug for your beverage.
▶ Does it have to be stored upright?
Nope, store it any way you want but you'll get better cooling results if its stored upright.
▶ Can I use the Coldwave to cool beer?
Yes! Just take the edge off the Coldwave first by cooling 16 oz. of cold/warm water for about 10 seconds. 
▶ How many times can I use the Coldwave before it needs to be refrozen?
It all depends on how hot your bevereage is so we've made the following guidelines:
Hot beverage: 2 x 16 oz.
Room temp. beverage:  6 x 16 oz.


▶ How long can I leave my Coldwave out before it doesn’t work anymore?
The Coldwave's cooling ability diminishes with time. After 2 hours of sitting out at room temperature it will only cool 1 (16oz.) coffee or 6 glasses (6 oz. per glass) of wine. After 4 hours of being left out the Coldwave will no longer cool beverages.

It’s built to withstand video editing, 3D-rendering tasks and high-performance computing.Artificial Intelligence maintains performance and endurance over the life of the product by keeping writes off the QLC, rather than degrading like other SSDs do after prolonged use.Never worry about SSD “sudden death” again.FuzeDrive delivers this unrivaled gaming experience with faster booting, shorter game load times and seamless shifting from one game to another using Artificial Intelligence (AI) software.AI learns how you use your system and automatically optimizes the SSD by moving your frequently accessed data to 128GB of SLC. It uses the high capacity QLC to store infrequently accessed data (like all those Steam Summer Sale games you bought and never played).FuzeDrive SSD stays cool under pressure and maintains optimal operating temperatures using a 3M Heat Dissipating label so your performance never suffers (at least not from lack of cooling).Spice up your desktop with an optional heatsink that has an LED light. If you have a clear case on your system, even better! FuzeDrive was created with heavy users and hardcore gamers in mind. Its low latency at low-queue depths gives users instantaneous response. Plus, it’s an easy integration on any PC or notebook and it can handle the biggest, baddest files that cause most heavy users fear when they try to launch.128GB of SLC and 3,470 MB/s read and 3,000 MB/s write give you slick video/sequential performance while 3,600 TBW delivers solid reliability. Bandwidth is nice, but performance really comes down to latency and FuzeDrive SSD delivers like no other drive.There’s no other NVMe SSD on the market that has this perfect balance of performance, endurance and price.A pure SLC drive of this capacity could cost upwards of $2,000 but the QLC enables affordable high capacity and SLC enables uncompromised performance and drive endurance. The only negative?

How many times have you declared you will eat healthier but still find yourself snacking on those cookies late at night? Truth is, most of us struggle to follow through on what we know is good for us. So, we asked ourselves, ‘Why are healthy habits so hard to form?’We’ve studied the science of habits. It turns out, you don’t need to work on a hundred different things to be healthy. You just need to start with one habit, a keystone habit! Drinking  fresh juice is the easiest form of healthy living. The problem with juicing is that it’s way too much work!!! Drinking is easy, but the cleaning that comes after is a nightmare!! This is why we created JUISIR, the innovative juicing machine that does not require any cleaning. In order to make JUISIR cheaper to the mass market and make healthy living accessible to everyone, please back us!!! Join the juicer revolution and be one of JUISIR’s first users.

 Check out what the media are saying on social media! 
 The Machine JUISIR is an innovative cold press juicer that extracts juice from fresh fruit and vegetables through a press with about eight-tons of force (approximately equal to the size of two adult elephants) in only 90 seconds. It’s powerful, fast, and effortless—with no cleaning required.
 The Juicing bag JUISIR offers two types of juicing bags - single use or multiple use,which are made from either biodegradable or recyclable materials. You can simply recycle or reuse the juicing bag - it's entirely up to you. DIY your juice packs and vary your juice recipes to different preferences and health needs.Chop fruit and vegetables into pieces roughly the size of a dollar coin for maximum yield. Put about 300g-350g (0.7lb-0.8lb) raw products per bag, you can get approximate 200-250ml (6.8oz-8.5oz) juice. The Juice JUISIR exerts about 8 tons of force so that the fruit is squashed to a paper-like thinness and virtually every drop of nutritious juice is captured in the glass. The Machine How does JUISIR produce approximately 8 tons of force?Our engineers have ingeniously utilized the patent-pending leverage principle to create torsion and hence produce a juicer that can exert up to 8 tons of force.Why does JUISIR require no cleaning? JUISIR works with our uniquely designed juicing bags which completely separate fruit and vegetables from the machine, meaning JUISIR itself never needs to be cleaned.The Juicing Bag How do I buy the juicing bags after the Indiegogo campaign? You will be able to find JUISIR on Amazon soon and we offer worldwide shipping at low cost. The cost-per-use can keep as low as 0.2 USD. In order to reduce the delivery cost and make juicing bags cheaper, we are looking for qualified local manufacturers of our juicing bags from all over the world.The MachineWhat are cold press juicers? Unlike traditional juicers such as centrifugal juicers, cold press juicers press fruit and vegetables using large amounts of force to produce a higher juice yield than traditional juices. The cold-pressing technique allows juice drinkers to enjoy maximum nutrition (especially maintain more than 50% enzymes in the cold-pressed juice) from fruits and vegetables as there is no heat produced during the juicing process.Comparing JUISIR with other types of juicersFurther Comparing JUISIR with other cold press juicers  The JuiceWhy juice? Pure fresh fruit and vegetable juice contains vital vitamins, minerals and nutrients. It is the easiest and most effective way to supplement nutrients and boost your energy.Why Cold-Pressed juice? There are minimal air contact and heat produced during the cold press juice process which helps reduce the oxidation and decomposition of nutrients. This, therefore, allows juice drinkers to enjoy maximum nutrition (especially maintain more than 50% enzymes in the cold-pressed juice) from fruit and vegetables. Cold-pressed juice also delivers a better taste and texture as there is no pulpy residues or bubbles left.Mystery of fiber Fiber comes in two varieties, both are beneficial to health:Soluble fiber, which dissolves in water, can help lower glucose levels as well as help lower blood cholesterol.Insoluble fiber, which does not dissolve in water, can help food move through your digestive system, promoting regularity and helping prevent constipation. There are sufficient soluble fibers in the fresh juice. If you are seeking to supplement nutrition for optimum health and boost your energy, drinking juice is the easiest and best solution.Balanced Diet Include more vegetables and low sugar fruits in your juice recipes for optimal health. Also, pay attention to the daily intake. Choose MyPlate - the official dietary guideline in the USA, recommends an adult male has maximum 16 ounces (about 450ml) fresh juice every day.Recommended Juice RecipeSustainabilitySave Water Do you know how many liters of water is used each time you clean a juicer? It accounts for around 200 liters (52.83 US gallons) of water for a 20-minute cleaning! Here at JUISIR, as the machine requires no cleaning after each use, you are not only saving yourself time and effort but you’re also helping to save water and look after the environment.Eco-friendly materials The inner bags of both single-use and multiple-use juicing bags are made from 100% natural cotton, which are biodegradable and renewable. Cotton, especially 100% cotton can biodegrade within as little as a week to average 5 months. The outside sections of the bags are recyclable too. We are finding professional bodies for recovery of the outer bags worldwide.PatentsAs the first tabletop cold press juicer that requires no cleaning and provides juicing bags that allows you to DIY juice packs, JUISIR has several patents pending.  Video 1: Juisir with Pomegranate Weight: 300g Juice: 236g Juice yield: 79%  Please wait, we have more videos coming soon... 
When this campaign is finished, we will send out a Reward Survey by email to ask for your mailing address and the JUISIR color you love. Based on the voting result, all backers might receive a big surprise in the future. Once you receive the email from us, you will have a few days to order and adjust the type. For those who have already pledged juicing bags sets, we have made notes for you and will double check with you through Reward Survey, so no worry for that. Stretch Goals We brought JUISIR to attend CES 2017 in Las Vegas and successfully released JUISIR to the public.Let's see what the global buyers are saying in CES 2017

The clean design, attractive price point, and varying features are there to suit your needs.     You can choose your desired cleaning pattern that most suits your space, OR you can put the robot on AUTO cleaning mode and let it do the job for you.   The Dust Sensor feature detects the dirtiest parts of the floor and guides the robot to spend more time cleaning those parts. Perfect for pet owners who need to clean their space from pet hair on a daily basis.   With a pressure of 1800 Pa, the HyperClean suction will securely and rigorously collect dust and tiny particles to keep floors immaculately clean. The Turbo Suction mode of MIRAVAC robots are the most powerful in their class.    The Smart Adaptive Detection System adequately equips MIRAVAC robots for automated cleaning and charging for any home or office floors: hardwood, carpet or tile. With the height of 3.15”, MIRAVAC robots can also clean under your objects and furniture.   With sensors that detect cliffs, MIRAVAC robots are able to avoid cliffs and unexpected drops.   LOOP is your floor’s new best friend. With the smart adaptive system for any environment, great suction power from 800 Pa to 1800 Pa, and contour following nozzle to ensure accurate cleaning results, LOOP is the most affordable advanced robotic vacuum for thin carpet and hard floors on the market. 
Dual rotating brushes vigorously sweep dirt and dust into the vacuum’s patch. 
The debris are then securely trapped using its dynamic vacuum motor. 
The click-on mopping pad collects even the finest dust particles to leave floors spotless.
    LOOP comes with Dry Mop Pads to be attached to the robot for shiny cleaning performance.    The sleek design of the SWERVE model makes a great looking cleaning companion at your home or office.   SWERVE comes with large wheels and a multi-surface roller brush that will pick up any large debris on the floor. This helps with the optimal deep cleaning of thick carpets and rugs.       Contains the vacuum within the desired space blocked by an invisible wall, available only for the SWERVE model.    Easily schedule cleaning time for 30, 45, or 60 minutes with the button on the device or through the remote control.   You can also set a cleaning time with the 24H button on the docking station.

Not much money for ""The Finer Things In Life"" but did the best they could to provide for their family. Seven wonderful kids who live together and dine together and care for each other...especially in the hard times. <br/><br/>Tragically, in 2012, the mother passed away after giving birth to the last child, Kashle. All 7 kids were taken in by their grandmother, and over the past two years, they have struggled just to make ends meet. They have to cut corners and sometimes they do not get enough to eat. The saddest part is, their 7 year old told me one day while she was at my house playing with my children: </p><p>""We don't celebrate Christmas anymore, We don't have enough money"". </p><p>This broke my heart beyond what i thought was possible. Sure, we all hear the stories about some family far away with next to nothing and begging for food, but when it is in your own neighborhood, it is hard to swallow! These children go to school with their books in plastic bags because they can not afford back-packs. They often wear the same clothes two days in a row because they can not afford to wash laundry everyday as we all know  how expensive it is. Often times, i feed them at my house because there just is not enough at their home. Nevaeh, whom is 7 years old, is one of those children that makes you smile even when you have a bad day. I asked her, ""Are you hungry?"" (as i heard her stomach growling) she told me ""No sir"" Even as a child, her manners are outstanding! She would rather starve than take someone else's food. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p><p>Life is so precious and there are 7 children who do not have any luxuries to speak of... not even something as simple as a stove to cook on. (Their meals are either cold or have to be microwaved.) Most of their clothes are ""hand-me-downs"" and what kills me, is they are all so grateful for the things they do have. The children don't see themselves as ""poor"" as children do not know the meaning, all they know is what they have and it means the world to them! <br/><br/>My wife and I are doing all we can to help but it is just not enough as we are providing for our family as well. Once a week, my wife or myself drive Mrs. Carla to the grocery store because her car is broke down and she does not have the money to get it fixed.<br/><br/>I'll be collecting any money raised here, and I'll use it to buy them items for Christmas.

One day, they finally got tired of dealing with a recurring problem in their cooking routine: <i>the juggle of where to put the lid while stirring a pot or adding more ingredients</i>. At first, they scoured stores in search of a device to solve this problem and were disappointed to find nothing useful. </p><p>After many discussions between the sisters and Svetlana's best friend, Rebecca, they finally decided to make one. But nothing is ever really that easy! While working on the idea, they quickly realized that adding yet another tool to a space that is already cluttered with gadgets was solving one problem and creating another, a storage dilemma. So they set out to create a product that would not only be useful for holding lids but would also fold flat for storage and while they were at it, they added a few trivets to take the place of multiple tools. And that's how Trivae was born! </p><p>While working with your friends isn't always easy, in some cases it <i>can</i> liven up the daily grind...</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Friends are always there to laugh at you and point out your mistakes."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/246/541/815045d0af60d4d6c90783865a48ee1a_original.gif?v=1404839339&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;q=92&amp;s=42302398422eb201291796f890273c82"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Friends are always there to laugh at you and point out your mistakes.</figcaption></figure><p></p><h1>
<br/><b>A Design Challenge</b> </h1><p>We explored several different designs and made numerous prototypes while working through each functional consideration. We wanted to make a product that was sturdy enough to support a lot of weight without sacrificing aesthetics. Our earlier efforts can be seen below in the first generation prototype on the right. As you can see, Trivae has traveled a long road.  </p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/618/965/94fe6284c339f7cc8fc9166062730a83_original.png?v=1411345089&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=29d1f9592eddeccd37fdc8c493aab417"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p>With the help of several designers and many hours spent scrutinizing CAD models, we've gone over every detail countless times. At each stage throughout the design process, we have made it a point to test Trivae's weight-bearing abilities and select materials suitable for the product's function, such as appropriate heat resistance and durability. </p><p>After three grueling years of testing, modifying, and re-testing, Trivae's final design and prototype are complete. Let us just say, we couldn’t be happier with it! The end result is a simple and modern tool that can be used in the kitchen or on the dining table.</p><h1><b>The Final Product</b></h1><p>Though we tried our best to incorporate all changes during the prototyping stage, there will be a few slight differences between the prototype you see in the video and the final manufactured product. With these tweaks we strengthened the overall structure, made the curves more streamlined, and selected the most durable finish for the product's purpose. This is a production sample showing Trivae's updated shape and finish!</p><div>

And unlike other lid holders, Trivae holds your lids in an inverted position keeping the condensation and food particles from cooking contained.It works with lids of any shape or size and the break in the rings is wide enough for any user's hand, with any type of lid handle, while leaving it within easy reach at all times.This means:
Both hands are free for cooking, stirring, and spicing your culinary creations 
Less risk of burns to hands and countertops from contact with hot lids 
Less of a mess to clean up after cooking
Trivae isn't just a safe place to rest your lids when you could use an extra hand. When your meal is ready to be served, fully collapse Trivae into a traditional trivet to protect your surfaces from any hot pot, pan, or dish.This position is also perfect for compact storage in most standard kitchen cabinets and drawers.In the fully expanded position, Trivae transforms into a dual trivet and can hold twice as many pots and pans or finished dishes.It also keeps large casseroles and other irregularly shaped dishes off of your surfaces. The perfect resting spot for that piping hot tray of delicious holiday cookies!Easy to use:
Each button (located on either side of the spine) operates the ring closest to it
Push the buttons toward the center (the arrows point the way) and rotate the rings to the desired position until you hear a click
The rings lock into each position to ensure stability
Serve and Entertain in Style:Trivae is visually appealing and perfect for presenting finished dishes in an elegant and unique way whether in a casual or formal setting.Trivae is right at home at both a BBQ and a formal dinner party!It's also quite useful in a restaurant or catering setting for elevating dishes--like a pizza!It's the perfect kitchen accessory (and gift) for:
Modern-day cooks
Aspiring & professional chefs
Stylish entertainers
Well, just about anyone really!

The StorySvetlana and her sister, Ruslana, are avid cooks who love to experiment in the kitchen and entertain their family. One day, they finally got tired of dealing with a recurring problem in their cooking routine: the juggle of where to put the lid while stirring a pot or adding more ingredients. At first, they scoured stores in search of a device to solve this problem and were disappointed to find nothing useful. After many discussions between the sisters and Svetlana's best friend, Rebecca, they finally decided to make one. But nothing is ever really that easy! While working on the idea, they quickly realized that adding yet another tool to a space that is already cluttered with gadgets was solving one problem and creating another, a storage dilemma. So they set out to create a product that would not only be useful for holding lids but would also fold flat for storage and while they were at it, they added a few trivets to take the place of multiple tools. And that's how Trivae was born! While working with your friends isn't always easy, in some cases it can liven up the daily grind...Friends are always there to laugh at you and point out your mistakes.
A Design Challenge We explored several different designs and made numerous prototypes while working through each functional consideration. We wanted to make a product that was sturdy enough to support a lot of weight without sacrificing aesthetics. Our earlier efforts can be seen below in the first generation prototype on the right. As you can see, Trivae has traveled a long road.  With the help of several designers and many hours spent scrutinizing CAD models, we've gone over every detail countless times. At each stage throughout the design process, we have made it a point to test Trivae's weight-bearing abilities and select materials suitable for the product's function, such as appropriate heat resistance and durability. After three grueling years of testing, modifying, and re-testing, Trivae's final design and prototype are complete. Let us just say, we couldn’t be happier with it! The end result is a simple and modern tool that can be used in the kitchen or on the dining table.The Final ProductThough we tried our best to incorporate all changes during the prototyping stage, there will be a few slight differences between the prototype you see in the video and the final manufactured product. With these tweaks we strengthened the overall structure, made the curves more streamlined, and selected the most durable finish for the product's purpose. This is a production sample showing Trivae's updated shape and finish!

It is the first ballistocardiography-driven (relies on the small movements from your heartbeat) smart mattress that lets you track heart rate variability, in addition to breathing, movement, stress and sleep cycles. Matrix will let you know exactly how you slept so you can make adjustments to your lifestyle and make sure you're getting the highest quality sleep possible. It starts recording data automatically. You don't need to set reminders to turn anything on; just go to sleep and let Matrix do all the work. Whether you're a professional athlete, a CEO or a devoted stay-at-home parent, no one can afford to be off their game, which is why we created Matrix to help improve productivity day after day. With the mattress made right here in the United States and the MatrixSense sensors made in Finland, Matrix is made with the highest quality materials and textiles to bring you a superior night's sleep every time you close your eyes.Tracking your sleep quality over time will alert you to trends and factors that impact your recovery time in bed and, ultimately, your performance when you wake up in the morning. It's the mattress you need for you, or you and your partner, if you want to get the most optimal sleep.Does your alarm ever go off and it feels like your eyelids weigh 20 pounds and you haven't had nearly enough sleep, regardless of the amount of hours you logged? This is because you were woken up during your REM sleep cycle, your deepest phase of sleep. Matrix starts recording sleep cycle data every two minutes within the alarm range that you set. This ensures the alarm will only go off during your lightest phase of sleep, so you can wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day.Select from a range between 15 and 60 minutes before you need to wake up so you can wake feeling refreshed, not dazed and confused.Choose from 10 alarm sounds, ranging from traditional options like Digital Alarm Clock to more unique options like Electronic Rise, Tropical Morning or Rise Tide.Quickly and easily set and label alarms for weekdays, weekend adventures and even afternoon power naps.Traditional sleep trackers and wearables rely only on movement detection and are not always accurate. Matrix users hyper-acute sleep sensors that rely on ballistocardiography to accurately measure a wide variety of wellness components. That data is then formulated into comprehensive graphs and automatically sent to your phone.The MatrixSense sensors in our patent-pending mattress are so sensitive that they can detect even the slightest movement, like your heartbeat, even through something as thick as your mattress. They are so reliable that they were originally used in the medical field to monitor epileptic patients. Every Matrix mattress comes with two sensors* so that it can individually track the health stats of two different users. Each user can sync their app to the sensor on the side of the bed that they sleep on, so that only their information is displayed.*Twin-sized Matrix mattresses only have 1 sensor. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a method for assessing stress levels in your body and their effects on your health. As you breathe in and out, heart rate variability is measured as the time gaps between your heart beats. That fluctuation between your beats? It's what we've dubbed the music of your heart. By tracking your HRV with the Matrix app, you'll be able to see how your lifestyle choices affect your overall health and conduct experiments to see how minor changes can have a big impact on your sleep quality. 

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) - While high HRV is linked to good health and fitness, decreased HRV is linked to stress and fatigue. MatrixSense gives you a full night's HRV analysis producing a reliable indicator of how your body recovers during the night. 

Sleep Quality - Using a sophisticated algorithm MatrixSense compares your personal data with established scientific standards for quality sleep to generate a simple indicator of how well you're sleeping. 

Sleep Cycles - Proper sleep allows your body to recover and be ready for the day ahead. MatrixSense's analysis differentiates between Deep Sleep (when your body recovers), REM Sleep (when your brain recovers), and Light Sleep (transitionary sleep).

Heart Rate - Using vibration sensitive technology, MatrixSense offers a detailed breakdown of your resting heart rate and average heart rate. Understanding your heart rate is a crucial measurement of understanding your general health.

Breathing - MatrixSense records the number of breaths you take per minute, keeping track of your sleep quality throughout the night and monitoring for any indications of sleep disorders or irregularities.

Movement - Whether it's restless sleep or getting out of bed, MatrixSense factors the movement of your body throughout the night into its long-term analysis.

Stress - Your autonomic nervous system controls and regulates all the functions necessary to maintain life. MatrixSense's state-of-the-art metrics review the impact of stress on the balance between your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.
You can track your sleep every night and make all the changes you want to, but if you're not sleeping on a good mattress, these changes won't make a big difference in your sleep quality. At Matrix, we believe in starting at the root of the problem, which is why we spent years perfecting our ultra-comfortable, American-made, CertiPUR-US-certified memory foam mattress that addresses and solves all the common complaints. The colorful, user-friendly interface of the Matrix app was designed with you in mind and is included with your mattress. The best part? The app is public and completely free! You'll receive regular updates and will never have to worry about paying subscription fees. Data from your Matrix mattress syncs automatically with your app, allowing you to ditch your wearable and just focus on deep, restful sleep.The brains behind this beauty (aka the founders of Matrix) have been innovators in the sleep space for nearly a decade. Over the past ten years, the partnerships we've forged have allowed us to produce the highest quality smart mattress at the fairest price. From sourcing the most innovative foam in America to seamlessly integrating the most advanced sleep sensors in the world, we've done everything in our power to create a product that is as comfortable as it is intelligent.It took years of research to get Matrix from concept to prototype to final product. With the help of our product development team and sleep testers, we've evaluated dozens of foam combinations, sensor placements and UX designs. Today, we're confident that our smart mattress will change the way you sleep, and ultimately, the way you live. We need your help to fund the final production processes so we can help everyone power their dreams through smarter sleep. The funds raised on Indiegogo will go toward working with developers to integrate the app with Apple Health and IFTTT, testing and quality assurance of the app, and fulfilling our initial orders. One of the first improvements we make to the app will be to make it compatible with Windows and Android.

Our UK based manufacturers have been chosen for their experience, ecological and ethical standards. Our aim is to produce products with a long life that you will not need to buy again.</p><h3>FAQs</h3><p><strong>Why Ocean Plastic?</strong></p><p>The horrific amount of plastic that is entering our oceans has to stop. If oceanic ecosystems collapse and the oxygen producing phytoplankton that give us our every second breath die, it’s simple - no oceans no air (NONA).</p><p><strong>Why the humble clothespin?</strong></p><p>Because it’s a useful, everyday product! There are so many ecological issues that need addressing regarding clothing and laundry, from fast fashion to detergents and water consumption …and of course the CO2 emissions from unnecessary tumble drying. If we can remove plastic from the ocean, encourage line-drying (to reduce CO2), and highlight a very serious ecological issue then we’ve made a change, even if it is small - for now.</p><p><strong>But shouldn’t we move completely away from plastic?</strong></p><p>In an ideal world yes, however plastics have been a wonderful invention. They have allowed us to manufacture products and devices that would otherwise not be possible. From the delicate keypad I am typing on right now, through to medical devices that save lives - just try and imagine a world without any plastic!</p><p>Our issue to date has largely been a reluctance to design with end-of-life in mind or the implementation of full product lifecycle systems in order to retrieve and recycle plastics. NONA's aim right now is to find a use for recycled ocean plastic, and in this way we can support the emerging circular economies that are dedicated to intercepting plastic before it enters out oceans.</p><p><strong>Why is the NONA Ocean Clothespin a better product?</strong></p><p>Well apart from the ecological benefits of it being manufactured from recycled ocean plastic, the NONA Ocean Clothespin has been designed to last. The simple mono-form design means that there are no moving parts to break, no springs to malfunction, it won’t rust, mould, crack or degrade - it should last a very long time. It works by utilising the natural flexibility of the material, the design is functional simplicity. Moreover because it is manufactured out of a single material, it can, should it need to be, once again recycled.</p><h3>NONA featured on the SHiFT Platform</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595929911/pypu9wbm3nw9qo1nlgv3.png"" src=""""/></p><p>NONA Ocean Clothespin has been featured on SHiFT.how as one of the ways to tackle ocean plastic pollution.</p><p>The SHiFT Method, created by Emily Penn, ocean advocate and eXXpedition Co-Founder, is designed to help people find their role in solving the world’s most pressing issues.</p><p>Emily’s philosophy towards life has been shaped by spending over a decade out at sea, where you are constantly reacting to the changes around you. </p><p>For Emily, that shift led her from a career in architecture to one dedicated to solving the issue of ocean plastic pollution.

One, we’re hoping, you will help us tell.Be the change you want to see in the world, with NONA; because - No Oceans, No Air.The big problem with ocean micro-plastic.MICRO PLASTICS. On the left, fish food. On the right, plastic. Photographed at Marine Biological Association, Plymouth, U.K. Photograph By David Liittschwager Every year 8 million metric tonnes of plastic enters the worlds oceans, by 2050 ocean plastic will outweigh fish. Once there it breaks down into tiny particles called micro-plastic, these particles enter the food chain simultaneously poisoning our food supplies and damaging marine eco-systems.When we consider that our every second breath was produced in the worlds oceans it becomes clear something must be done, because No Oceans, No Air.NONA's mission.OCEAN TURTLE TRAPPED IN 'GHOST FISHING GEAR' - Image credit WWF Our mission is to reduce ocean plastic by producing well designed, durable everyday products.The ocean plastic we use is sourced as a result of an interception program in place across various ports that reimburses fisherman for worn-out fishing gear. Your investment in NONA helps to support the circular economies dedicated to intercepting plastic, before it enters the ocean.Introducing NONA Ocean Clothespin.Practically unbreakable.NONA Ocean Clothespin is a simple mono-form design which means that there are no moving parts to break, no springs to malfunction, it won’t rust, mould or degrade. Effortless to use.NONA Ocean Clothespin swiftly glides on and smartly draws off, it's natural flexibility means it can adjust to hold all kinds of laundry.  The unique wave feature offers grip strengths ranging from delicate though to strong, meaning NONA is highly effective even in strong winds.Actively reduce your carbon footprint.NONA Ocean Clothespin is more than an investment in cleaning up ocean plastic pollution. It’s a tool to personally save as much as 1 ton of CO2 emissions every year through hang-drying and because it's gentler your clothes will last longer too. Sunlight a known disinfectant.Sunlight is known to kill pathogens including viruses and bacteria, meaning line-dried clothes are not only fresher smelling but also healthier. Designed and made in Britain.Designed to last, the NONA Ocean Clothespin is manufactured in Britain to the highest ecological, ethical and manufacturing standards. Free worldwide delivery.Our plastic free, letterbox friendly package ships worldwide to your door, for free.Features. Made from 100% Recycled Ocean Plastic

Project Timeline.Research and development. 3D modelling and rapid prototyping.We have undertaken extensive design, 3D modelling, rapid prototyping and product testing. The product has been through a number of design, prototyping and evaluation cycles to optimise functionality. Manufacture and material procurement.Our procurement process has ensured that all the material we use is verified by our suppliers for source authenticity, supply chain transparency and social, environmental and legal compliance. Our UK based manufacturers have been chosen for their experience, ecological and ethical standards. Our aim is to produce products with a long life that you will not need to buy again.FAQsWhy Ocean Plastic?The horrific amount of plastic that is entering our oceans has to stop. If oceanic ecosystems collapse and the oxygen producing phytoplankton that give us our every second breath die, it’s simple - no oceans no air (NONA).Why the humble clothespin?Because it’s a useful, everyday product! There are so many ecological issues that need addressing regarding clothing and laundry, from fast fashion to detergents and water consumption …and of course the CO2 emissions from unnecessary tumble drying. If we can remove plastic from the ocean, encourage line-drying (to reduce CO2), and highlight a very serious ecological issue then we’ve made a change, even if it is small - for now.But shouldn’t we move completely away from plastic?In an ideal world yes, however plastics have been a wonderful invention. They have allowed us to manufacture products and devices that would otherwise not be possible. From the delicate keypad I am typing on right now, through to medical devices that save lives - just try and imagine a world without any plastic!Our issue to date has largely been a reluctance to design with end-of-life in mind or the implementation of full product lifecycle systems in order to retrieve and recycle plastics. NONA's aim right now is to find a use for recycled ocean plastic, and in this way we can support the emerging circular economies that are dedicated to intercepting plastic before it enters out oceans.Why is the NONA Ocean Clothespin a better product?Well apart from the ecological benefits of it being manufactured from recycled ocean plastic, the NONA Ocean Clothespin has been designed to last. The simple mono-form design means that there are no moving parts to break, no springs to malfunction, it won’t rust, mould, crack or degrade - it should last a very long time. It works by utilising the natural flexibility of the material, the design is functional simplicity. Moreover because it is manufactured out of a single material, it can, should it need to be, once again recycled.NONA featured on the SHiFT PlatformNONA Ocean Clothespin has been featured on SHiFT.how as one of the ways to tackle ocean plastic pollution.The SHiFT Method, created by Emily Penn, ocean advocate and eXXpedition Co-Founder, is designed to help people find their role in solving the world’s most pressing issues.Emily’s philosophy towards life has been shaped by spending over a decade out at sea, where you are constantly reacting to the changes around you. For Emily, that shift led her from a career in architecture to one dedicated to solving the issue of ocean plastic pollution. The more time Emily spent at sea, the more she realised the solutions start on land. Through her workshops, curated experiences and sailing expeditions she’s worked with individuals, businesses and governments around the world to develop solutions, from sea to source.Check out the new platform SHiFT.how and find other ways that can help you to reduce ocean plastic. #jointheSHiFTGet social, follow us on. Enquiries. For enquiries please contact us here madebynona.comResources and further reading. The circular economy solution to plastic pollution Ellen MacArthur FoundationWomen-led War on Plastic 1883 MagazineBy 2050, the oceans could have more plastic than fish Business InsiderHow does plastic end up in the ocean?
