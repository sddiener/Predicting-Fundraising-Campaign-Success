A silent alarm to replace loud, noisy alarms and inefficient sleep aids.
Wake up effortlessly, naturally, and with more energy than ever before - all on silent. The VibeRise band immediately improves mornings by optimizing your transition from sleep to wakefulness, and its companion app has easy-to-use features with actionable insights that make improving your sleep health a breeze.
VibeRise can save your mornings, your mood, and even your relationships. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg.
 


 
 
 

No more groggy mornings or going to bed dreading the morning.
Loud alarms are terrible for your health & sleep environment. They make it nearly impossible to feel well-rested when waking up to a noisy alarm, and sets you up for exhaustion.
VibeRise eliminates all noises and intense settings that ruin your quality of sleep. The VibeRise app adds to the ability to understand your own sleep behaviors, and fast forward to waking up better & improving your sleep health long-term.
 

 
Introducing VibeRise.
VibeRise is both a silent wearable alarm & sleep tracker. We're growing in the right direction to improve the way you wake up, for better mornings and long-term sleep insights.


 
 
 

VibeRise makes sleep smarter and better.
VibeRise is an advanced silent alarm reinvented to make us love waking up again. It’s a soft wrist wearable built with silent sensors that use Vibrotactile Haptic Feedback that gradually nudges your brain out of your current sleep stage, and slowly syncs your sleep cycle to your body’s ideal circadian rhythm. 


 
 
 
The best solution for long-term health and enjoyable mornings.
Sleep is important for your health, your mood, your productivity, and your quality of life. 
This is the best sleepwear for improving your sleep hygiene and protecting your sleep environment. It eliminates the need for disruptive loud alarms and inefficient sleep trackers. 
VibeRise was built to support healthy sleep for all types of sleepers and sleep environments. You can wake  up feeling well-rested no matter how early you have to be up or how little sleep you got*.
*VibeRise is not a substitute for insufficient sleep.

 
 
Built for all types of sleepers and sleep environments.
 

 
 
 
Benefits to waking up better.
Wake up easier.
VibeRise uses gentle-wake features to nudge you out of your sleep cycle without jolting you awake.
It will reduce grogginess when you wake up, so you feel well-rested and are less-likely to snooze or oversleep. It immediately improves your mood which also benefits your productivity and energy throughout the day.
 

 
 
Reduced morning stress.
VibeRise protects you from physically waking up to stressors, which makes it easier to enjoy waking up every morning.

 
 
Improving long-term sleep.
Better sleep is about understanding your own sleep behaviors and patterns over time.
VibeRise tracks the important details from the moment you set your alarm to the moment you wake up. You can gauge how your sleep performance changes over time. Whether you’re an early riser or a heavy sleeper, you can manage your sleep for your personal needs. 

 
 
Better sleep for everyone, anywhere, anytime.
Waking up to someone else’s alarm is frustrating and stressful. With VibeRise, this will never going to be an issue again, even with different morning routines or different sleep habits.
VibeRise is small and portable, so you can use it anywhere you go. Subtle designs wake you up with minimal disruption, preserve your sleep environment, and make maximum improvements to your sleep health. 

 
 
Easy to use and benefits are long-lasting.
With an increasing need for smarter sleep tech, VibeRise is the first to optimize both the way we wake up in the morning as well as improve our overall sleep health by waking you up feeling well-rested.

 
 
 
Product Features
Vibrotactile Haptic Feedback
Similar to bone conduction in some modern headphones, VibeRise places powerful, silent haptic motors directly on your wrist bones. This allows soft feedback from Viberise to create a strong sensation felt throughout the entirety of your forearm. VHF makes VibeRise gentle, yet reliable in waking you up from even the deepest phases of sleep..

 
 
Smart fabric. Comfort is our strong point.
Made from flexible, soft-to-the-touch fabrics, VibeRise is the most comfortable wearable to wear to sleep every night.


 
 
Seamless integration with mobile app.
When you wear your device to bed, it automatically collects insights about your sleep based on when you set your alarm, and how you woke up. It’s easy and efficient; all you have to do is wake up.

 
 
 
App Features
Actionable insights.
VibeRise knows everything from the moment you set your alarm to the minute you wake up. You can assess not just last night's sleep quality, but also look at your sleep habits over a period of time.

 
 
Tracks sleep behavior.
VibeRise makes it easy to understand your personal sleep type and routine. From the moment you wake up, you can assess your sleep quality score and understand how you slept.

 
 
A complete sleep stats assessment.
Easily access a full overview of individual stats from last night, as well as long-term. 

 
 
Understand last night, every night.
Insights and data are easy to break down. VibeRise makes it easy to understand your personal sleep patterns and habits, and facilitate real impact.

 
 
 
 
Long-term foundation for better health & quality of life.

 
 Our insights help you avoid prolonging sleep debt, set up a consistent bedtime schedule, and protect your sleep health with smarter insights. Overall VibeRise sets up a health foundation for a better quality of life.
 
 
Your health.
With our busy lives and work schedules, it’s a priority to focus on our health. Being well-rested is a foundation for better physical, mental, and emotional health. VibeRise makes waking up enjoyable to make better choices for our health even easier.
 

 
 
Better sleep.
How you wake up is as important as how much you sleep. 
Overall waking up well-rested gives you the energy and mood to stay feeling good even well after the morning. You don’t run into the problem of feeling like you’re running on empty during the day. You build healthy, consistent sleep schedules just by waking up well-rested.

We are ramping up to reach our 200% funding goal. When we do, we're going to give all backers a carrying case, perfect for taking VibeRise on-the-go and for safekeeping.

<p>Long before REÅLEA SKINCARE was a company, the precursor balm to what would become our signature product, AURORA, came into being after alchemist founder Nick's wife Cody gave birth to their beautiful daughter Pepper, who was born several months early by emergency cesarean weighing only 2.2 lbs. Cody asked for help in healing from the procedure, so Nick formulated a topical balm to be maximally effective while also gentle and nourishing. Now, Cody and Pepper are vibrant, healthy, and thriving, and Cody has virtually no detectable scar from the surgery.</p>

<p>Reducing waste is a critical issue in the fight against climate change and human survival. Recycling is no doubt better than the landfill but it still has a significant carbon footprint. Here at REÅLEA SKINCARE, we're striving to do things different. We invest extra in our product containers in several ways with the objective for all of them to be REUSED either by you as the customer or us as the business. We also use COMPOSTABLE cardboard cartons, soy plant-based ink with no VOC's on upcycled paper made from sugar cane byproduct material called bagasse which contains 0% tree.</p>

<p>Note, as alchemists, we respect gold - the incorruptible metal. Gold possesses the unique property of being so extraordinarily malleable that the gold leaf used on the label is a mere fraction of a micron thick. We also believe that in order to meet the challenges of climate change, as a society we must attitudinally change as well as materially--and the simple act of a customer practicing their own reuse of appropriate containers leads to the overall shift in holistic consciousness needed.</p>

<p>Violet purple color protects the biophotonic energy of products stored within its glass. Violet glass is the only glass known to offer this important protection, assuring that the smell, color, bioenergy and our products' other vital properties remain preserved longer. Violet glass’ inherent properties filter out the more damaging rays of the visible light spectrum while also uniquely allowing the beneficial portions of the UVA and infrared light waves in, keeping the products inside fresher for a longer period of time. Violet glass also acts as a barrier, preventing the loss of biophotons from the product stored within, making preservatives less necessary. Tests have shown that products stored in violet glass keep their distinctive qualities for extended periods of time, sometimes even for years. The sooner a product is consumed the better, but it will still have benefited from the energy-enhancing properties of the violet glass. </p>

<p>Finding skincare that keeps your body in vibrant, healthy balance—this has long been a quest of greatest personal necessity shared by both founders of REÅLEA SKINCARE, Nick and Crispin. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and Type I Diabetes, respectively, meant both men have journeyed far outside of clinical Western medicine to keep themselves thriving. Tired of the underperformance, misinformation, and wasteful practices of many so-called “natural” products— with hidden fillers and pollutant-causing binders—they decided to formulate their own line of results-driven and truly natural skincare. Skincare that doesn’t harm its users nor the Earth; made purely with ingredients from Nature that are fantastic for human health. </p>

<p>Rare Earth Alchemy, Inc. dba REÅLEA SKINCARE (pronounced ""rey-á-lee-a"") is a California benefit corporation following responsible business practices in creating world-class alchemical goods. We are dedicated to improving human health and furthering the alchemical arts. With Nick's training in Classics and Medieval Middle Eastern history, and Crispin's wide ranging esoteric experience, we are equipped with the language and knowledge to access formulas, philosophies, and methods that lie outside the domain of what is attainable to most. We believe that holistic wellness is achieved by the combination of great products and great practices. </p>

<p>We have a vision of creating a renaissance of environmentally harmonious alchemical products with verifiable results for the modern age. As a new business, we’re taking steps towards this vision and inviting support to achieve it. We currently have sampled our skincare products with more than 500 people ranging in age from 1 to 80 years old receiving extremely encouraging results. We have conducted feedback surveys and interviewed small focus groups. We have produced and tested many versions, refining our formulas to optimize efficacy, absorption, storage, consistency, color, and fragrance. Reaching our goal of $25,000 enables us to fulfill all the campaign orders and launch our online store.</p>

<p>""I use Aurora every night before bed. It makes me feel like royalty."" -- Meredith Rom, Host of Rising Women Leaders, Petaluma, CA</p>
<p>""Your cream healed my cracked fingers overnight. And my skin feels so smooth."" --Jonathan A, San Francisco, CA</p>
<p>""I love these aromatic and soothing products! After using Tenebris and Aurora after hip surgery, my skin is now surprisingly silky and smooth. Amazingly, with the combination of nature, nurture and their signature alchemy, the scar is barely visible! I also use the oil Astrum as a facial moisturizer for my dry skin. It has a subtle fragrance with a hint of lavender. Delicious! I am 73 years old."" -- Laurel, San Geromino, CA</p>
<p>""Aurora - love the scent, and the way the fragrance develops after exposure to skin and body heat; my face feels softer, and the dark circles under my eyes have faded; my skin tone is more even; softens lips and cuticles; and absorbs quickly without feeling oily or greasy. A small amount goes a long way."" -- Popsy K, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>""The first time I tried Aurora, the weird red mark on my face that I thought was some kind of inevitable aging thing and had long given up on, disappeared in three days. I seriously recommend this stuff.""-- Sara G, MA</p>
<p>""I have always suffered from dry skin and cracking skin on my finger tips, and it usually involves me wrapping them in band aids for days with moisturizers. When I used Aurora it healed the crack overnight, and in the morning there was no sign of any skin damage or dryness."" -- Mike K, Seattle, WA</p>
<p>""The facial mist immediately refreshed my spirit. It was palpable. Meridiem immediately sunk into my skin on my hands. Wow. The scent is very grounding. Visibly already improved my very dry hands. I have very sensitive psoriatic dry skin. "" -- Munpriya S, Portland, OR</p>
<p>""Now after using Aurora and Meridiem for several weeks, my skin is totally healed and even hyper-pigmentation from psoriasis is totally gone."" -- Munpriya S, Portland, OR</p>
<p>""Aurora is doing really well for my face. It's definitely very hydrating and since using it, I haven't needed to use my other creams which is a really good sign. I usually have to put on creams several times a day due to the very dry cold and windy environment where I live at 9,000 ft in the Rocky Mountains."" -- Ruth M., Crestone, CO</p>
<p>""These are THE BEST for healing, scars &amp; burns ~ I am amazed &amp; grateful."" -- Braden K, Maui, HI</p>
<p>""We gave your sample to an elderly lady friend of ours who immediately felt her entire spiritual vibration lifted by the product."" -- Michael Z, Petaluma, CA</p>
<p>""I wanted to tell you that we adore your Aurora cream...used it only once on my baby's eczema behind his ears and it was gone. I had terrible poison oak starting on my hands and feet last week and after using the Aurora it's totally gone. You're doing God's work!!"" -- Elyse, Mendocino, CA</p>
<p>""Subtle, fresh, bright scent. I like the weight of Astrum for both hair and face - it soaks in and feels soft to the touch but not oily. Lighter than some face oils I've tried, not heavy or lingering. Appearance of less dry skin and hair (ends only)."" -- Betsy E, Petaluma, CA</p>
<p>""The products are so nice! My skin is super happy, feels very dewy and healthy. I use the Aurora balm every day, morning and night. I use the oil at night on my eyes."" -- Sarah C, Berkley, CA</p>

<p>NICK GROSSENBACHER (pictured on right)</p>
<p>Our Head of Product is Nick Grossenbacher. He is an alchemist, product formulator, herbalist, historian and bookbinder. Nick has immersed himself in studies of herbalism and traditional healing with regional experts throughout the world, and is a graduate of the Spagyricus School of Alchemy in Washington under esteemed alchemist and chemist Robert Bartlett. Nick's studies of traditional medicine have taken him to India, the Middle East, the Balkans, Guatemala and Scotland. He holds a B.A. in History from the University of Southern California and an M.A. in Medieval Middle Eastern History from the University of Washington.</p>
<p>As an academic historian, Nick fell in love with the exploration of ancient and early modern medicinal texts. But his curiosity yearned for more than dry academic knowledge—he began to recreate the centuries-old practices at home, breathing new life into them. The early balms worked amazingly well. So he embarked on a years-long journey towards a mastery of the long-forgotten techniques. The exceptional formulations you see today have been guided by these ancient principles and philosophies, combined with the rigor of modern laboratory techniques. </p>
<p>Nick was turned on to the alchemical tradition as a result of a profound dream rich with alchemical symbolism. He initially approached alchemy through the lens of academic study, given his background as a historian, but over time began to put theory to practice and eventually found the Spagyricus School. Nick's training in Classics and Medieval Middle Eastern history have equipped him with the skills necessary to access formulas, philosophies, and methods that lie outside the domain of what is accessible to most modern students of the art.</p>
<p>CRISPIN CLARKE</p>
<p>As a longtime non-violence educator, clinical mental health leader, and Hatha yoga teacher, Crispin works to heal and nourish communities. Coming most recently from a several-years venture in digital health, Crispin co-founded REÅLEA with Nick in 2020. He leads the business development and strategic vision, helping to guide REÅLEA as an instrument of communal health and environmental action. He directly experienced the efficacy of Nick's products in a striking fashion when he used a precursor to the currently available version of Aurora to heal his skin from the constant minor wounds where he has to wear an insulin pump due to his Type 1 Diabetes. He holds a B.A. in Sociology &amp; Anthropology from Swarthmore College, PA.</p>

<p>The funds raised are guaranteed first to be used for manufacturing, packaging and delivering the perks you order. Funds raised above the base goal of $25,000 will be used to create even more awesome products for our backers and soon thereafter for our customers in the open market. REÅLEA founders and a family friend have invested $60,000 of their own capital into product research &amp; development, laboratory equipment, facility space, materials, design, legal, accounting, marketing and operational infrastructure. It will cost approximately $25,000 to manufacture and package the 1,000 units of our first five products for all our supporters and then launch our online store. This is our base goal. We would like to go above and beyond — reaching $50,000 would enable us to launch a refill program for our products' glass containers. If we reach $75,000 to $100,000, we will be able to accelerate the creation of future REÅLEA SKINCARE products including in different categories such as nutritional supplements. We are currently working on a new eye cream using green coffee bean oil as well as an unscented healing balm, a massage oil, and a men's beard butter. Thank you so much for your support!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As all startup consumer brands, we face stiff competition to excel in the market and will have to work hard to serve our customers but we are dedicated to do so. In the beauty and wellness market, we believe that we have something truly unique and effective to offer. Based on the powerful positive responses we have received, we are confident in our innovative and potent alchemical approach and in the standout performance of our products. We have an advantage in that our products are entirely made by us in our alchemical laboratory and we are not dependent upon any technical third parties. The logistics of our planned container refill program do present a challenge to do in a cost-effective and easy to do way, but for the sustainability of our life on the Earth: it's worthwhile and we hope the trend is picked up across the cosmetics industry. We will provide custom mailer boxes for sets of purchased products and then sanitize and recirculate the returned jars and bottles at our facility and warehouse.</p>

REÅLEA SKINCARE revives the best kept secrets of traditional herbal medicine to offer you unparalleled skincare products that are truly 100% all natural. Look and feel your best while in harmony with the planet. Alchemizing Nature's Kingdoms: Vegetabilia・Mineralia・Animalia.

Long before REÅLEA SKINCARE was a company, the precursor balm to what would become our signature product, AURORA, came into being after alchemist founder Nick's wife Cody gave birth to their beautiful daughter Pepper, who was born several months early by emergency cesarean weighing only 2.2 lbs. Cody asked for help in healing from the procedure, so Nick formulated a topical balm to be maximally effective while also gentle and nourishing. Now, Cody and Pepper are vibrant, healthy, and thriving, and Cody has virtually no detectable scar from the surgery.

 


Combining revived ancient healing practices with groundbreaking research informed by clinical science, we are launching a collection of five truly natural and highly effective alchemical skincare products: from a healing beauty salve, a protective body butter, a relieving balm, a nourishing oil, to a refreshing face mist.

Reducing waste is a critical issue in the fight against climate change and human survival. Recycling is no doubt better than the landfill but it still has a significant carbon footprint. Here at REÅLEA SKINCARE, we're striving to do things different. We invest extra in our product containers in several ways with the objective for all of them to be REUSED either by you as the customer or us as the business. We also use COMPOSTABLE cardboard cartons, soy plant-based ink with no VOC's on upcycled paper made from sugar cane byproduct material called bagasse which contains 0% tree.


All our skincare product containers are made from special violet glass which is protective and preservative of living essences
Tight sealing, easy to open durable lids
Durable ceramic printed labels
Precious metal 18k gold ink
Talismanic minimalist design


Note, as alchemists, we respect gold - the incorruptible metal. Gold possesses the unique property of being so extraordinarily malleable that the gold leaf used on the label is a mere fraction of a micron thick. We also believe that in order to meet the challenges of climate change, as a society we must attitudinally change as well as materially--and the simple act of a customer practicing their own reuse of appropriate containers leads to the overall shift in holistic consciousness needed.

Violet purple color protects the biophotonic energy of products stored within its glass. Violet glass is the only glass known to offer this important protection, assuring that the smell, color, bioenergy and our products' other vital properties remain preserved longer. Violet glass’ inherent properties filter out the more damaging rays of the visible light spectrum while also uniquely allowing the beneficial portions of the UVA and infrared light waves in, keeping the products inside fresher for a longer period of time. Violet glass also acts as a barrier, preventing the loss of biophotons from the product stored within, making preservatives less necessary. Tests have shown that products stored in violet glass keep their distinctive qualities for extended periods of time, sometimes even for years. The sooner a product is consumed the better, but it will still have benefited from the energy-enhancing properties of the violet glass. 

Our empty jars appear purple against the sun, and with the gold symbols illuminated look very cool! Nothing better for storing living materials such as seeds, flowers, herbs, medicines, foods, topicals, and oils... Get creative & share the love to educate and inspire others on how you REUSE your REÅLEA SKINCARE container! #reuserealea 
 

Finding skincare that keeps your body in vibrant, healthy balance—this has long been a quest of greatest personal necessity shared by both founders of REÅLEA SKINCARE, Nick and Crispin. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and Type I Diabetes, respectively, meant both men have journeyed far outside of clinical Western medicine to keep themselves thriving. Tired of the underperformance, misinformation, and wasteful practices of many so-called “natural” products— with hidden fillers and pollutant-causing binders—they decided to formulate their own line of results-driven and truly natural skincare. Skincare that doesn’t harm its users nor the Earth; made purely with ingredients from Nature that are fantastic for human health. 
 
Rare Earth Alchemy, Inc. dba REÅLEA SKINCARE (pronounced ""rey-á-lee-a"") is a California benefit corporation following responsible business practices in creating world-class alchemical goods. We are dedicated to improving human health and furthering the alchemical arts. With Nick's training in Classics and Medieval Middle Eastern history, and Crispin's wide ranging esoteric experience, we are equipped with the language and knowledge to access formulas, philosophies, and methods that lie outside the domain of what is attainable to most. We believe that holistic wellness is achieved by the combination of great products and great practices. 
 

We have a vision of creating a renaissance of environmentally harmonious alchemical products with verifiable results for the modern age. As a new business, we’re taking steps towards this vision and inviting support to achieve it. We currently have sampled our skincare products with more than 500 people ranging in age from 1 to 80 years old receiving extremely encouraging results. We have conducted feedback surveys and interviewed small focus groups. We have produced and tested many versions, refining our formulas to optimize efficacy, absorption, storage, consistency, color, and fragrance. Reaching our goal of $25,000 enables us to fulfill all the campaign orders and launch our online store.
 

""I use Aurora every night before bed. It makes me feel like royalty."" -- Meredith Rom, Host of Rising Women Leaders, Petaluma, CA
""Your cream healed my cracked fingers overnight. And my skin feels so smooth."" --Jonathan A, San Francisco, CA
""I love these aromatic and soothing products! After using Tenebris and Aurora after hip surgery, my skin is now surprisingly silky and smooth. Amazingly, with the combination of nature, nurture and their signature alchemy, the scar is barely visible! I also use the oil Astrum as a facial moisturizer for my dry skin. It has a subtle fragrance with a hint of lavender. Delicious! I am 73 years old."" -- Laurel, San Geromino, CA
""Aurora - love the scent, and the way the fragrance develops after exposure to skin and body heat; my face feels softer, and the dark circles under my eyes have faded; my skin tone is more even; softens lips and cuticles; and absorbs quickly without feeling oily or greasy. A small amount goes a long way."" -- Popsy K, Washington, D.C.
""The first time I tried Aurora, the weird red mark on my face that I thought was some kind of inevitable aging thing and had long given up on, disappeared in three days. I seriously recommend this stuff.""-- Sara G, MA
""I have always suffered from dry skin and cracking skin on my finger tips, and it usually involves me wrapping them in band aids for days with moisturizers. When I used Aurora it healed the crack overnight, and in the morning there was no sign of any skin damage or dryness."" -- Mike K, Seattle, WA
""The facial mist immediately refreshed my spirit. It was palpable. Meridiem immediately sunk into my skin on my hands. Wow. The scent is very grounding. Visibly already improved my very dry hands. I have very sensitive psoriatic dry skin. "" -- Munpriya S, Portland, OR
""Now after using Aurora and Meridiem for several weeks, my skin is totally healed and even hyper-pigmentation from psoriasis is totally gone."" -- Munpriya S, Portland, OR
""Aurora is doing really well for my face. It's definitely very hydrating and since using it, I haven't needed to use my other creams which is a really good sign. I usually have to put on creams several times a day due to the very dry cold and windy environment where I live at 9,000 ft in the Rocky Mountains."" -- Ruth M., Crestone, CO
""These are THE BEST for healing, scars & burns ~ I am amazed & grateful."" -- Braden K, Maui, HI
""We gave your sample to an elderly lady friend of ours who immediately felt her entire spiritual vibration lifted by the product."" -- Michael Z, Petaluma, CA
""I wanted to tell you that we adore your Aurora cream...used it only once on my baby's eczema behind his ears and it was gone. I had terrible poison oak starting on my hands and feet last week and after using the Aurora it's totally gone. You're doing God's work!!"" -- Elyse, Mendocino, CA
""Subtle, fresh, bright scent. I like the weight of Astrum for both hair and face - it soaks in and feels soft to the touch but not oily. Lighter than some face oils I've tried, not heavy or lingering. Appearance of less dry skin and hair (ends only)."" -- Betsy E, Petaluma, CA
""The products are so nice! My skin is super happy, feels very dewy and healthy. I use the Aurora balm every day, morning and night. I use the oil at night on my eyes."" -- Sarah C, Berkley, CA
""Aurora is pure MAGIC! It is a sublime blend of potency, nourishment and exquisite beauty. The skin literally wants to feast on the banquet of subtle scents, texture and flavors that humans long to 'taste'. It helps remind skin - our largest organ - what it is truly capable of being, feeling and looking."" -- Steve S, Alameda, CA

What is Electrolysis?</strong></p><p>There are actually 2 ways sodium hypochlorite can be produced.</p><p>We use electrolysis, and the process works by dissolving salt in softened water, which results in a concentrated brine solution. That solution inside the CleanseBud pod is then electrolyzed by internal components for 3 minutes until it forms a sodium hypochlorite solution in water.</p><p>Electrolysis is the safer and easier way to produce sodium hypochlorite. The other way is to add chlorine gas (Cl2) to caustic soda (NaOH). When this is done, sodium hypochlorite, water (H2O) and salt (NaCl) are produced according to the following reaction:</p><p>Cl2 + 2NaOH + → NaOCl + NaCl + H2O</p><p>You can read more about sodium hypochlorite via electrolysis here:</p><p>● <a href=""https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/312816/TechBrief_ElectrochemicalGeneratedDisinfectants.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CDN</a></p><p>● <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/10/12/1733/htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MDPI</a></p><p>● <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/262/1/012185/pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IOP Science</a></p><p><strong>2. What type of salt should I add?</strong></p><p>A: Normal salt you would get from the supermarket. To be specific, ‘table Salt’, white, fine grained. Not sea salt or any type.</p><p><strong>3. What is the solution? What is the composition?</strong></p><p>A: After the electrolysis process, salt and water turn into sodium hypochlorite solution.</p><p>Sodium hypochlorite  (NaClO)</p><p>Ordinary salt = sodium chloride (NaCl)</p><p>water  (H20)</p><p><strong>Chemical equation: NaCl + H2O + ELECTROLYSIS  ⇒ NaCIO + H2</strong></p><p><strong>4. How much salt should I add?</strong></p><p>A: 1g measuring spoon (comes with the package) of table salt for the 30ml water container. Further ratios can be found in the instructions manual.</p><p><strong>5. Can I eat, drink and consume food after spray with Cleansebud?</strong></p><p>A: Do not directly consume the food sprayed with cleaner water. Wash with clean water before consumption.</p><p><strong>6. How much does Cleansebud weigh? And how big it is?</strong></p><p>A: Cleansebud weight only 2.4oz/67g dry.</p><p>Dimensions of Cleansebud: 91mm x 61mm x 28mm (Length, width and height)</p><p><strong>7. Why can’t I spray on electronic devices?</strong></p><p>A: Is the same reason you would not wash your phone or your electronic devices (unless your phone is waterproofed). The solution turns into mist when you spray it out, the mist could get into electronic devices and potentially damage it, hence we don’t recommend spray directly on it.</p><p><strong>8. Can I spray on cloth, jacket, pants, silk, leather?</strong></p><p>A: The solution has a bleaching effect on fabrics, colored or dark clothing used with caution. Do not soak silk or genuine leather. The solution has an oxidizing effect on metals. If metal utensils are directly sterilized, they should be rinsed with water immediately after use and wiped off.</p><p><strong>9. How long will the solution last?</strong></p><p>A: It will take the Cleanseud 3 mins to fully electrolyze. The solution lasts for 24 hours after the electrolysis process. You can start the electrolyze process and generate a new solution. If you're not planning to use it within the next 7 days, please empty the water container (tank).</p><p><strong>10. Can I add more salt to electrolysis?</strong></p><p>A: Yes you can add more salt into the water container to increase the concentration of the solution. Detailed information of salt and water ratio can be found in the instruction manual.</p><p><strong>11. Will I get shocked or short-circuited?</strong></p><p>A: Do not immerse this product or the power cord in any liquid. Do not plug or unplug the charging cable with wet hands.</p><p><strong>12. Charging cable included? How long does it take to charge? And how long does it last?</strong></p><p>A: A TYPE-C charging cable will be included in the package. Takes the bud 1-1.2 hours to charge. At full charge, it will allow the bud to have 25-30 rounds of electrolysis process at 3 minutes each time.</p><p><strong>13. Can we cancel the pledge?</strong></p><p>A: You can cancel your pledge before the campaign ends. We do not offer refunds, returns, or exchanges on items received as Kickstarter rewards once the campaign ends. We appreciate your understanding of our policy and your support.</p><p><strong>14. Will the liquid in the container leak out?</strong></p><p>A: No it won’t. The rubber on the device will seal the container from any leakage.</p><p><strong>15. What is the PledgeBox Survey?</strong></p><p>A: PledgeBox is a third-party backer management platform that handles the survey for our campaign, after the campaign ends PledgeBox will send out a survey where you will be able to add any add-ons, update your shipping information.</p><p>However, we will take responsibility for defective products. Just contact our customer service, at hello@cleansebot.com.</p><p><strong>16.

The world health crisis we are going through teaches us a painful lesson on the importance of hygiene and cleanliness. Whether it is the shortage of traditional cleaners caused by panic buying and low supply or traveling in or to a place where cleaners are hard to get, an easy, homemade alternative puts anyone in a much safer position.We have Fulfilled all pledges from our previous campaign.CleanseBud is a revolutionary portable cleaning and sanitizing product from the same team that designed and launched the Cleansebot, a groundbreaking sanitizing robot. With just two common household ingredients - water and salt - an effective cleaning agent can be easily created through the process of electrolysis. Because of its easy recipe and portability, you’re able to take care of cleanliness anywhere you go.   Sodium hypochlorite cleans the surface of an object and keeps it clean for a period of time. To demonstrate this, we used cut avocados for testing. On the left is an avocado that has not been sprayed with sodium hypochlorite. It oxidizes naturally over time and rot appears on the surface. The avocado on the right is sprayed with the sodium hypochlorite formed by CleanseBud. During the following 12 hours of the test, we sprayed it every 10 minutes, and you can see that it can effectively inhibit the growth of and preserve the avocado.*Disclaimer: some white crystals may appear after drying.*This part is to showcase the effectiveness of Cleansebud. 




 

 First just add salt and water to the water tank. Remember to keep it below the marked line so nothing spills over.   Then allow the electrolysis process to run for just 3 minutes, small bubbles will appear in the water, and wait for the cleaning solution to be produced.  Spray the solution over the tops and insides of your hands and go about your day. Easy and simple.   Simply wipe your frequently used items with a towel or napkin after spraying the solution to it.   CleanseBud helps you in all household and surface cleaning. Use it on the floor, in the kitchen, on any surface, your dirty shoes, in the bathroom...and more. Spray CleanseBud on anywhere!     Please Note: 1. Items like knife, cutting board and dinnerwares will need to fully rinsed before contact with food.2. Electronic devices are best not to be sprayed on but wiped with towel.    Because CleanseBud is reusable and only takes salt and water for its chemical reaction, you save money from buying additional cleaners and sanitizers.  The world is having too many bottles thrown away as rublish, and we probably know the fact that it is almost impossible for plastic to recycle, recycling plastic bottles is just too expensive and takes too much energy, so most of them are just  dumped in landfills.  We came up with the idea of a reusable pod to replace plastic bottles, not only to help us to save money on buying bottle sanitizers again and again, but also to contribute in saving our environment.    CleanseBud is half the size of an adult's palm, and with a net weight of 67g, it can easily fit in your pocket or your purse for daily use. Use it when you have to touch something in the public.   It works by you adding the correct amount of water and amount of salt according to package directions to fit your requirements. For example, if you need the solution for sanitizing your hands or cleaning fresh food, we recommend 1g to 3g of salt. For household and surface cleaning, our suggestion is to add no more than 2g salt.Then press the button and allow the electrolysis process to run uninterrupted for three minutes. Wait until the light turns green on the container to show you that electrolysis is complete. It is immediately ready for use!   Sodium hypochlorite (NaCIO) is the chemical compound used in water purification and in bleach, though household cleaning bleach has several other compounds as well. Diluted solutions of sodium hypochlorite (50 ppm to 1.5%) are found globally in cleaning sprays and wipes. It also has stain-removing properties.Sodium hypochlorite in a solution has broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties and is widely used already in healthcare facilities as a cleaner diluted in water.Uses of sodium hypochlorite depend on the percentage in the solution. For example, most household beaches for laundry are a 3-8% solution of sodium hypochlorite at the time of manufacturing. The strength of it depends on the brand and does gradually decrease if stored over a long time. A 12% solution is often used in water processing for the chlorination of water, and a 15% solution is commonly used to clean wastewater in treatment plants.In a pinch, sodium hypochlorite can even be used for cleaning drinking water in emergencies. See this article in the American Water Works Association Journal for more details on household and emergency water treatment.   After the turning water and salt into cleaner, it will last for 24 hours. After 24 hours the effective chlorine concentration will gradually decrease. But you can simply restart the electrolysis process again, to reacquire your cleaner.At full charge, CleanseBud’s battery can last up to 25 - 30 rounds of electrolysis process at 3 minutes each.  The CleanseBud component can also fit a larger container which holds 100ml liquid, so don't worry if you're in need of more cleaner. The 100 ml container is available as an add-on to this campaign.  The standard 30ml CleanseBud can meet your daily cleaning needs, and the large capacity of 100ml can help you do household cleaning. In addition, our measuring spoon is designed according to the standard 1g capacity, which can better help you control the concentration ratio.   We have now reached the prototype stage of production. We were thankfully able to already start molding, and we know the next step is to move to mass production. Before the launch of CleanseBud, we have already done part of the trial production. There are already hundreds of sets of CleanseBud finished products in our inventory. But we still need your help and the funds from Kickstarter to cover the cost of mass production.   From our previous project, we learn that having the molds done before the campaign starts is very important, this can benefit both backers and our production. We will be able to start production and backer will receive their pledges sooner.   We provide free shipping to these regions: United States, Canada, Europe (Only for 23 countries, see below), HongKong, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia.European countries include: Cyprus, Greece, France, Slovenia, Lithuania, Croatia, Poland, Portugal, Malta, Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, Estonia, Luxembourg, Latvia, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, Germany, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic, Austria.Other countries shipping fees will charge after the campaign ends, please refer to our survey.After the campaign ends, you will receive an email with a survey link, where you can complete your payment, add any accessories as add-ons, fill in your address and contact information.  Our product price does not include VAT or import tax.  But we will try our best to declare a relatively reasonable value for the product. But please keep in mind, we can’t guarantee you won’t be taxed. Our package is relatively small, from past experience, chance small parcels are less likely to be taxed.But rules and regulations for different countries and regions can vary, we can't guarantee anything. Our goal is to provide you with quality, safe and reliable products on time. All funds will be used to start mass production and launch CleanseBud. According to the Kickstarter Terms of Use, we will not provide refunds or returns. If you receive a problematic item, please report it immediately after receiving the package and contact us at hello@cleansebud.com. We value Kickstarter supporters very much, and we will put in all our efforts to ensure that you have an awesome CleanseBud.    Sodium hypochlorite has been used in households since at least 1785 when Frenchman Berthollet developed liquid bleaching agents based on sodium hypochlorite. The Javel company originally introduced this product as “Liqueur de Javel.”Here is some more information on sodium hypochlorite from experts:● You can see here on the CDC website that sodium hypochlorite is a recommended cleaner for various uses in medical settings.● You can also see here from Pacific Medical Centers that it is used in cleaning directly.● The World Health Organization published this guideline on hygiene and mentions sodium hypochlorite quite a bit in cleaning and hygiene.● As for skin safety, Stanford Medicine published this article on how diluted sodium hypochlorite can potentially combat skin damage and aging.● For why the it will only last for relative short time, see the following study:  Stability of sodium hypochlorite solutions, on how sodium hypochlorite will gradually reduce its concentration.   To prove the cleaning abilities of CleanseBud, we requested testing from STC and ICAS. More test reports from other institutes are on the way and feel free to check out the details of the test reports by clicking on the following button.    1. What is Electrolysis?There are actually 2 ways sodium hypochlorite can be produced.We use electrolysis, and the process works by dissolving salt in softened water, which results in a concentrated brine solution. That solution inside the CleanseBud pod is then electrolyzed by internal components for 3 minutes until it forms a sodium hypochlorite solution in water.Electrolysis is the safer and easier way to produce sodium hypochlorite. The other way is to add chlorine gas (Cl2) to caustic soda (NaOH). When this is done, sodium hypochlorite, water (H2O) and salt (NaCl) are produced according to the following reaction:Cl2 + 2NaOH + → NaOCl + NaCl + H2OYou can read more about sodium hypochlorite via electrolysis here:● CDN● MDPI● IOP Science2. What type of salt should I add?A: Normal salt you would get from the supermarket. To be specific, ‘table Salt’, white, fine grained. Not sea salt or any type.3. What is the solution? What is the composition?A: After the electrolysis process, salt and water turn into sodium hypochlorite solution.Sodium hypochlorite  (NaClO)Ordinary salt = sodium chloride (NaCl)water  (H20)Chemical equation: NaCl + H2O + ELECTROLYSIS  ⇒ NaCIO + H24. How much salt should I add?A: 1g measuring spoon (comes with the package) of table salt for the 30ml water container. Further ratios can be found in the instructions manual.5. Can I eat, drink and consume food after spray with Cleansebud?A: Do not directly consume the food sprayed with cleaner water. Wash with clean water before consumption.6. How much does Cleansebud weigh? And how big it is?A: Cleansebud weight only 2.4oz/67g dry.Dimensions of Cleansebud: 91mm x 61mm x 28mm (Length, width and height)7. Why can’t I spray on electronic devices?A: Is the same reason you would not wash your phone or your electronic devices (unless your phone is waterproofed). The solution turns into mist when you spray it out, the mist could get into electronic devices and potentially damage it, hence we don’t recommend spray directly on it.8. Can I spray on cloth, jacket, pants, silk, leather?A: The solution has a bleaching effect on fabrics, colored or dark clothing used with caution. Do not soak silk or genuine leather. The solution has an oxidizing effect on metals. If metal utensils are directly sterilized, they should be rinsed with water immediately after use and wiped off.9. How long will the solution last?A: It will take the Cleanseud 3 mins to fully electrolyze. The solution lasts for 24 hours after the electrolysis process. You can start the electrolyze process and generate a new solution. If you're not planning to use it within the next 7 days, please empty the water container (tank).10. Can I add more salt to electrolysis?A: Yes you can add more salt into the water container to increase the concentration of the solution. Detailed information of salt and water ratio can be found in the instruction manual.11. Will I get shocked or short-circuited?A: Do not immerse this product or the power cord in any liquid. Do not plug or unplug the charging cable with wet hands.12. Charging cable included? How long does it take to charge? And how long does it last?A: A TYPE-C charging cable will be included in the package. Takes the bud 1-1.2 hours to charge. At full charge, it will allow the bud to have 25-30 rounds of electrolysis process at 3 minutes each time.13. Can we cancel the pledge?A: You can cancel your pledge before the campaign ends. We do not offer refunds, returns, or exchanges on items received as Kickstarter rewards once the campaign ends. We appreciate your understanding of our policy and your support.14. Will the liquid in the container leak out?A: No it won’t. The rubber on the device will seal the container from any leakage.15. What is the PledgeBox Survey?A: PledgeBox is a third-party backer management platform that handles the survey for our campaign, after the campaign ends PledgeBox will send out a survey where you will be able to add any add-ons, update your shipping information.However, we will take responsibility for defective products. Just contact our customer service, at hello@cleansebot.com.16. How do I contact the Cleansebud Team?A: You can either:1: Write us an email to hello@cleansebot.com.2: Send us a message on KickStarter.17. What is your refund policy?A: Orders from 'backers' are not considered as 'purchases', but rather a contribution with a 'reward' in return for believing in and for funding the project. That's why refunds of contributions are not available for our project on this platform.The support we get from our backers is what enables us to grow and choose crowdfunding as our business model.18.

3D contoured design, with no pressure on the eyes
Fitted nose baffle design blocks out all light
High-quality nylon/polyurethane foam for ultimate comfort
Elastic strap design
8 easily adjustable buckles for a custom fit
    Snore Earset E4 is a physical anti-snoring device developed based on the principle of snoring. It monitors snoring through an intelligent snore recognition system, and uses a patented anti-snoring algorithm to accurately determine the snoring index of users. Upon detecting snoring, Snore Earset E4 physically intervenes with micro vibrations, which drive the nerve center of the brain to send out commands to tighten the muscles of the throat, thereby opening the airway to make breathing smoother. Snoring is therefore significantly reduced or completely stopped, all while ensuring undisturbed sleep. The free Sleeplus app monitors your sleep and allows you to view relevant sleep data, including snore data, intervention data, and sleep analysis reports. Kick-start your journey towards healthy, peaceful sleep with the Snore Earset E4.  By combining the latest bone conduction technology and snore recognition technology with an innovative anti-snoring algorithm, the Snore Earset E4 can effectively and accurately determine the snoring index of each individual user.   Upon detecting snoring, the device automatically intervenes with micro vibrations (ranging from weak to strong). These vibrations stimulate the nerve center and drive the muscles of the throat to contract and open the airway, thereby maintaining smooth breathing, effectively stopping snoring, and improving sleep quality. Smart physical intervention Changes to snoring after a period of use  The intensity of intervention can be adjusted through the Sleeplus app based on individual needs, with users able to choose from 36 levels of intervention.  After syncing data, you can view snore data, intervention data, and sleep analysis report via the Sleeplus app, and keep track of changes in your sleep patterns. Snore stopperAfter syncing your device data with the app, you can view your sleep data, snore data, and intervention data, and you can customize the intensity of vibration and snore sensitivity of the snore stopper. SleepingThe sleep aid function provides soothing music to help relax your mind and body and promote better sleep. RecorderWith the recording function, you can record your snoring and play it back at any time to compare the effects of using the snore stopper.  The ergonomic earhook design perfectly fits the shape of the ear, while the food grade silicone material ensures a secure and comfortable fit for long-term use.  step1: Place the device above the ear.step2: Slide it down the outer ear to a comfortable position.  Our tests in respiratory departments across several hospitals in Shenzhen prove that the Snore Earset effectively stimulates the contraction of the muscles of the throat and opens the airway, thereby helping reduce snoring or the frequency of snoring. All test results are supported by relevant data.  Moreover, our proprietary anti-snoring algorithm has obtained patent certificates in both China and Japan.About us VVFLY Electronics Co,. LTD  is focused on people's sleep quality. We assembled an experienced software and hardware development dream team with a goal to create an ultra first class hardware and software smart snore stopping device for people to effectively solve the snoring problems.  Our purpose is to dare to innovate, pursue perfection, and strive for excellence.

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>I’m Hoang - a father of two children. When one of them started primary school, I was confused about choosing a suitable backpack. Most of the backpacks that I saw were flashy, bulky, and failed to meet my expectations for a school backpack. I also felt they put my kid at risk of falling by being off-balance. Besides, bringing an extremely heavy backpack to school every day could cause many back issues for kids, such as back pain. Since collecting and working with backpacks has been my passion for such a long time, I had a desire to design a capable backpack for my little son. This was the powerful motivator for me to make my dream come true.</p>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/1f94da_80376a77ed1f4300b8c905ce253745f4~mv2.gif"" src=""""/></div>

<div> </div>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>After extensive research, I noticed that to reduce back pain, the weight of backpacks should account for 5-7% of a kid’s body weight. However, a light backpack is insufficient to keep them protected from the books in their backpack, which easily bumps into their back when moving around and causes pain.</p>
<p>Hence, after two years of development, the first Tinipak version was born. It was called TiniBox, with a mission to help kids “fly to school.” Tinipak is the lightest ergonomic backpack and at the forefront of personalized and flexible design - with easy to attach accessories.</p>

<p><strong>TiniBox </strong>is designed with a thick back panel and ergonomic prototype frame, keeping kids safe from back pain caused by backpacks. Tinipak leads the market with <strong>lightweight</strong>, <strong>ergonomic </strong>backpacks for kids and focuses on maximizing innovative features for kids at school. A sternum strap prevents the straps from sliding off kids’ shoulders while they inevitably run and jump around with their backpacks on.</p>

<p>It is common for kids to take regular public transit (vs. a dedicated school bus) to school, so they need a transit card and some cash on the way. They may also be required to have their name tag/ID showing (e.g., a lanyard around their neck in school). <strong>TiniCard </strong>is designed to streamline both of these student needs.</p>

<p>Our product is mainly designed for kids. However, according to the many positive feedbacks we've received, Tinipak has been enjoyed by many adults as well. Our product would be perfect for those who are under 5’11’’. You can read the review from Pangolins- a team of backpack geeks, for further information. So if you are a grown-up and considering owning one, let’s give it a try. We believe that it won’t make you disappointed!</p>

<p>We have spent the last two years researching the design and materials to create a backpack. It took us 18 months of failures to design a beautiful product on paper that was too difficult to build in practice. However, from this first lesson, we gained a lot of experience and knowledge to make Tinipak’s first product.</p>
<p>We comprehend our target users and their context of use, and we can determine their demands. We try to meet their needs, providing them a comfortable experience, which lets them focus on learning.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1632760423/br5m7hlvapodauxvjueq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The design process is an iterative process that involves sketches, 3D design, mockups, trying on models, and sewing on the sample fabrics. For each version, we evaluated the users’ context and requirements to check the design's performance and then tried to match the users’ specific context and satisfy all of their relevant needs. For this, I observed my son's usage context and behavior for quite a long time and then tried to identify and address the limitation for each version.</p>
<p>The best product has to be perfect in every detail. An example of this is designing a durable zipper head that is easy for children's small hands to hold and pull. Being a small start-up like Tinipak, we were so glad to convince YKK, the no.1 zipper brand globally, to become our partner.</p>

<p>From Osprey, The North Face, Jack Wolfskin, Samsonite, and the newer, creative brand names such as Peak Design and Nomatic, we found that the next generation of backpacks is becoming more innovative and convenient, providing a better experience for users.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1632760972/snlu2qebipbqnwpyniut.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Historically, the backpack was created during wars, when soldiers had to carry large amounts of equipment into battle. Afterwards, it became more widely used in daily life. However, we realized that their features were not optimal, especially for primary/elementary school life. Children with small shoulders wear backpacks every day; however, few brands have yet to design anything for them. We realized that we needed to redefine school backpacks, and with that, Tinipak was born. Our goal is to help students go to school more comfortably and conveniently.</p>

<p>Tinipak's first version was launched in Vietnam in August 2020. It gained a considerable number of compliments from Vietnamese residents and foreign followers. We appreciated the suggestions and feedback from the first followers, which allowed us to perfect this version to launch on Kickstarter and bring this dream to the world. </p>

<p>Over the years, with diligence and craftsmanship, Vietnam has produced many products for leading brands globally. However, Vietnam doesn’t yet have a world-recognized brand, and we feel that we have a mission to make one.</p>
<p>To build a well-known brand, besides excellent manufacturing, it is necessary to develop an industrial design. Thousands of Vietnamese students in this field have graduated, but there is no place to build their skills, and they work in different jobs. For this reason, we would love to promote this industry in our country.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>After a minor scale release in Vietnam, we hope that the global community will support our campaign. This can motivate us to build a team, a company, and a pretty new profession in Vietnam. Your support also helps us focus on creating, designing, and manufacturing high-quality backpack brands and solving problems with intelligent, handy solutions.</p>

</div></div>","Story
I’m Hoang - a father of two children. When one of them started primary school, I was confused about choosing a suitable backpack. Most of the backpacks that I saw were flashy, bulky, and failed to meet my expectations for a school backpack. I also felt they put my kid at risk of falling by being off-balance. Besides, bringing an extremely heavy backpack to school every day could cause many back issues for kids, such as back pain. Since collecting and working with backpacks has been my passion for such a long time, I had a desire to design a capable backpack for my little son. This was the powerful motivator for me to make my dream come true.


 

 
After extensive research, I noticed that to reduce back pain, the weight of backpacks should account for 5-7% of a kid’s body weight. However, a light backpack is insufficient to keep them protected from the books in their backpack, which easily bumps into their back when moving around and causes pain.
Hence, after two years of development, the first Tinipak version was born. It was called TiniBox, with a mission to help kids “fly to school.” Tinipak is the lightest ergonomic backpack and at the forefront of personalized and flexible design - with easy to attach accessories.

 

 

 
 


The prominent zippers on minimal pattern create a modern and unique look for Tinipak and highlight the Paker - a compelling feature to show kid’s personalities. Tinipak has 3 Simplicity colors available with the personalized packers collection. 
 

We combined student-friendly features with a gender-neutral style to create a Tinipak backpack. 

Tinipak is boxy but rounded. It maintains a rigid silhouette and a balanced shape even when empty, which keeps it from falling over when put down. 
 

Tinipak backpack remains lightweight, at only 660 grams, with many smart features. TiniBox deletes redundant details and refines innovative features to reach an efficient weight.
 

 
 

  

Paker is a collection of patches designed by Tinipak. Paker can be changed for different special occasions, making it superior to other backpacks' fixed and boring stickers.

Paker has been made for the global version and updated continually. 

Each of our products (TiniBox, TiniPenbox, and TiniPencilbox) included a Paker. Paker will be distributed at the end of the campaign.

 

 

Tinipak has chosen magnetic locks that are easier for little hands. The convenient magnetic chest strap helps to keep the shoulder straps from slipping off kids' little shoulders, letting them free to run and jump.
 
 
The innovative magnetic buckle is attached directly to one strap without webbing, enabling easy one-handed attachment/detachment.
 
 
 

 
 
Modular with TiniFile: The power of organization with 11 compartments keeps school supplies separated and clean, with quick access and easy storage.
 
 

TiniBox can be used for kids who want to organize books in a large space, or it can be more organized with TiniFile, where books and papers are divided into three vertical compartments for children who need to be careful and tidy.
 

Tinipak found that wearing ID cards around the neck is very inconvenient and annoying for children because they are so active. To facilitate the most comfortable experience for children at school every day, Tinipak designed TiniCard for the global version.
 

 
 

 


TiniBox is designed with a thick back panel and ergonomic prototype frame, keeping kids safe from back pain caused by backpacks. Tinipak leads the market with lightweight, ergonomic backpacks for kids and focuses on maximizing innovative features for kids at school. A sternum strap prevents the straps from sliding off kids’ shoulders while they inevitably run and jump around with their backpacks on.
With TiniFile, books are close to your back, which avoids distributing the force that causes back pain.
 

In poor lighting conditions like early morning, in the rain, or in the dark, the reflective lines in front of the TiniBox and on the two straps are highly visible to any traffic, which helps avoid accidents.
 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 
 
It is common for kids to take regular public transit (vs. a dedicated school bus) to school, so they need a transit card and some cash on the way. They may also be required to have their name tag/ID showing (e.g., a lanyard around their neck in school). TiniCard is designed to streamline both of these student needs.
 
Other backpacks on the market cannot achieve any functionality to facilitate a quick and easy experience. Tinipak, with a modular design, helps kids feel more comfortable when they bring it to school.
 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 
 
Other backpacks have traditional pen cases, which are inconvenient: Everything is floating around in space. It can be disruptive for students when they try to find what they need. Moreover, it is hard to consider which one might be missing, a part of why kids forget their stuff.
TiniPenbox is designed to keep the stuff that goes to school neat, convenient, and organized with your kids.
 


Tinipak keeps students from forgetting or losing their belongings, as all items are organized.
 

 
 

All stuff designed by Tinipak: We focus on the convenience of the product and the detail of items, like the more extensive and bolder digit to help kids easily see numbers.
 
 

 


 
 

We chose materials to meet the following criteria: lightweight, durable, and convenient for children to use.
 
 

 
 

Our product is mainly designed for kids. However, according to the many positive feedbacks we've received, Tinipak has been enjoyed by many adults as well. Our product would be perfect for those who are under 5’11’’. You can read the review from Pangolins- a team of backpack geeks, for further information. So if you are a grown-up and considering owning one, let’s give it a try. We believe that it won’t make you disappointed!
 
 

 


 

 
 

 
 

 
We have spent the last two years researching the design and materials to create a backpack. It took us 18 months of failures to design a beautiful product on paper that was too difficult to build in practice. However, from this first lesson, we gained a lot of experience and knowledge to make Tinipak’s first product.
We comprehend our target users and their context of use, and we can determine their demands. We try to meet their needs, providing them a comfortable experience, which lets them focus on learning.

The design process is an iterative process that involves sketches, 3D design, mockups, trying on models, and sewing on the sample fabrics. For each version, we evaluated the users’ context and requirements to check the design's performance and then tried to match the users’ specific context and satisfy all of their relevant needs. For this, I observed my son's usage context and behavior for quite a long time and then tried to identify and address the limitation for each version.
The best product has to be perfect in every detail. An example of this is designing a durable zipper head that is easy for children's small hands to hold and pull. Being a small start-up like Tinipak, we were so glad to convince YKK, the no.1 zipper brand globally, to become our partner.
 

 
For the development of Paker, after researching many partners around the world, we are proud to have chosen in-house production of all Paker, so we, Vietnamese, make them. We printed on different materials to achieve the perfect finish and retain the most vibrant colors for more children's enjoyment.

 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 
From Osprey, The North Face, Jack Wolfskin, Samsonite, and the newer, creative brand names such as Peak Design and Nomatic, we found that the next generation of backpacks is becoming more innovative and convenient, providing a better experience for users.

 
Historically, the backpack was created during wars, when soldiers had to carry large amounts of equipment into battle. Afterwards, it became more widely used in daily life. However, we realized that their features were not optimal, especially for primary/elementary school life. Children with small shoulders wear backpacks every day; however, few brands have yet to design anything for them. We realized that we needed to redefine school backpacks, and with that, Tinipak was born. Our goal is to help students go to school more comfortably and conveniently.
 
Tinipak's first version was launched in Vietnam in August 2020. It gained a considerable number of compliments from Vietnamese residents and foreign followers. We appreciated the suggestions and feedback from the first followers, which allowed us to perfect this version to launch on Kickstarter and bring this dream to the world. 
 


 
 

 
Over the years, with diligence and craftsmanship, Vietnam has produced many products for leading brands globally. However, Vietnam doesn’t yet have a world-recognized brand, and we feel that we have a mission to make one.
To build a well-known brand, besides excellent manufacturing, it is necessary to develop an industrial design. Thousands of Vietnamese students in this field have graduated, but there is no place to build their skills, and they work in different jobs. For this reason, we would love to promote this industry in our country.
 

 
After a minor scale release in Vietnam, we hope that the global community will support our campaign. This can motivate us to build a team, a company, and a pretty new profession in Vietnam. Your support also helps us focus on creating, designing, and manufacturing high-quality backpack brands and solving problems with intelligent, handy solutions.
We have spent over two years - such a long journey to be here. If Tinipak brings real value to you, please support us and share Tinipak with everyone.
We can't do this without you.

sleep easily and deeply? Spent the night tossing and turning — how you'll feel the next day? Tired, cranky, and out of sorts.Let Banala® Lite help you out.Banala® Lite is a smart sleep-cycle-inducing system integrated with isochronic sound technology in the form of a mini-speaker to give you the best sleep ever, every night. The system works by inducing your body and mind to sync perfectly with your very own natural sleep cycle.Several studies have proven the incredible benefits of isochronic tones. Although they are well-known in the medical community, they are not as widespread among the rest of society. We have decided to bring their benefits to your sleep journey. They’re a natural and effective way to improve sleep and well-being.
 

 
Fall Asleep Quickly and Deeply in Just One Button Push:
Just one button push and Banala Lite will take care of the rest of your sleep journey.Banala Lite is the perfect solution to put you to the best sleep. You will then wake up with a fresh, comfy, and clear mind.Waking up as a brand-new you!  When you use Banala Lite regularly, your sleep cycle will be restored to its best. As your sleep cycle improves, your sleep will improve.    Banala Lite will take you to a new level of your sleep journey, from the very beginning through to wake-up. The sleep cycle is an oscillation between the slow-wave and REM (paradoxical) phases of sleep. In humans, this cycle takes 1-2 hours. A good night's sleep consists of 5-6 complete sleep cycles.  During sleep, you usually go through five stages of sleep. Simplified, stages 1-2 are light sleep, 3-4 are deep sleep, and 5 is REM sleep, also referred to as rapid eye movement sleep—the dream state.
The first is light sleep. During this stage, you drift in and out of sleep. Your eyes move slowly, your muscle activity is low, and you would be easy to wake up.
In the second stage, your body starts preparing for deep sleep. Your eye movements and brain waves slow down, your body temperature drops, and your heart rate slows down.
When you enter the third stage, you are in a deep sleep. Extremely slow brain waves called delta waves are intermixed with smaller, faster brain waves.
In stage four, you stay in a deep sleep and your brain almost exclusively produces the slow delta waves, guiding you towards the fifth stage.
You now enter the last stage, stage five, also called REM sleep. Your eyes are closed but they move rapidly from side to side due to the intense dream and brain activity you experience during this stage.
  Our patent-pending system will stimulate you through each stage of the sleep cycle. It helps restore your natural sleep cycle to its best.When you cannot fall asleep quickly, it’s usually because the beta wave rhythm in your brain is still high. Banala’s smart sleep-cycle-inducing system will start with the theta isochronic tone to slow down the messy brain activity and prepare you for the sleep state. The system works throughout your sleep by using the theta wave to make you fall asleep quickly and the delta wave to make you experience deep sleep. Also, the secret blend of other beneficial waves will take care of you while you sleep.When you use Banala Lite regularly, your sleep cycle will be restored to its best. This will lead to many benefits, including the fact that you will no longer wake up in the middle of the night. As your sleep cycle improves, your sleep will improve and you will wake up with a fresh and clear mind.        Isochronic TonesImproving Sleep and Power Napping – When you're struggling to get to sleep, your brain is probably producing too much beta activity. Banala with isochronic tone technology can be used to reduce beta activity and increase the low delta and theta frequency range. This will help you get to sleep faster and deeper.  Brainwave Frequencies for Better SleepBrainwave speed is measured in Hertz (Hz) and relates to the number of cycles per second. A 5Hz brainwave is cycling at a rate of five times per second.Our brainwave activity reflects how we are feeling and what we are doing. If slower brainwaves are dominant, we might feel sleepy, very relaxed, or dreamy.  Brainwave entrainment methods like isochronic tones are used to stimulate and produce more brainwave activity of a specific frequency or range, making it more dominant. This helps Banala effectively give you the best sleep. You can reduce high brain wave frequency by listening to slower-speed isochronic tones, which will help calm your mind and bring down your stress levels.  Delta Waves0.5Hz-4Hz – Delta waves are very slow and low in frequency. You produce the most delta activity during your deepest sleep. During delta, your body does most of its healing and regenerating of cells. Theta Waves4Hz to 8Hz – Theta waves are also mainly dominant during sleep, in a state of deep relaxation, or when we are drifting in and out of sleep. Specification:Output Power: 3WDischarge Current: 5V/0.5ABattery: 400mAh 3.7VCharging Current: 200mASize: Ø70 x 40 mmWeight: 120gActive Time: Up to 12 hoursStandby Time: Up to 20 hours BluetoothHand-free phone operation.AUX5V USB-C rapid chargingBanala Life is a company dedicated to helping people all over the world sleep better.

<p>TA-SK allows you to overcome this problem: through an adequate degree of <strong>compression </strong>it increases the oxygenation of the muscles, allowing to <strong>recover passively</strong> in a reduced time! You can wear TA-SK under your clothes during the day in a comfortable way and <strong>GET READY TO THE NEXT SESSION</strong> quicker.</p>

See it in Action. C-REST PILLOW is a NECK RELIEF Pillow ✔️ that provides the ergonomic support and helps you fall asleep effortlessly. It improves neck posture for those with aches, pain, discomfort, or anything in between. It helps relax muscles, relieves tension, and improves the mobility of the neck and shoulders. Take a nap, or take a good night of sleep with C-Rest Pillow- the most ergonomic pillow, ever. Relax. Fall Asleep in Minutes! Rest on C-Rest PillowLiving with neck pain is pain. If you have frequent neck pain or know someone who does, you know it’s not an easy problem to get rid of. Chiropractic, Massage, and physiotherapy are costly and time-consuming. Why there isn't a solution for home care?Stop band-aiding the problem with medications. We must align our cervical spines to reverseall these negative effects of tech devices, gravity, injuries, and whiplashes.  Straight Out of Medical Book Your neck is out of balance. Let’s fix that! Rest on C-RestResting on C-REST PILLOW ( for as little as 10-15 minutes a day) can help restore your default neck posture (the natural curve of the neck: cervical lordosis). Designed and tested by ergonomists, it aligns your head and neck for proper support, so you can sleep soundly.Mimics the Feeling of Getting a Neck-MassageIt is made of integral skin foam. When your head rests on C-Rest Pillow, the integral skin foam takes the pressure and expand, providing gentle stretches. Gentle, but perfectly therapeutic. It feels just like a professional's hands.  You can take a nap or a night of sleep if you like. It's effortless. It's best to use:
in the morning, to warm up the neck spines
in the evening, to restore the damage after a long day of work
before/after exercises, to relieve stress and tension
   The C-Rest Pillow’s form was designed to mimic the effect of having a pair of expert hands give you a neck-massage. Its unique shape cradles the head while relying on the head’s weight to stretch your neck out ever so gently, relieving pain in as quick as 10 minutes. Its name comes from the C-curve that defines its shape as well as from the C1-C6 cervical vertebrae in the neck region that it aims to relax.  The pillow comes molded from a unique integral skin foam that’s both rigid yet comfortable. The foam’s density allows the C-Rest pillow to maintain its shape, unlike most regular, orthopedic, or travel pillows that just deform to take the shape of your head. The pillow’s unique shape-retention property, combined with its low-poly design helps it get to work on key pressure points of the neck, working on bones, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels to help restore your neck’s natural curves (or cervical lordosis, as your chiropractor would say), relieving stress, tension, poor sleep, or anything in between.1. Effortless & On-the-go. We know, “We tried, too.” Most devices like foam rollers & massagers are not designed specifically for your neck; otherwise, they are mostly awkward and require some background knowledge.That's why we made C-REST PILLOW. A device, specifically designed for your neck that helps us wind down naturally for better, deeper relief in your neck.  2. Align the Natural C-Curve in a matter of minutes.Restoring the curve in your cervical spine cues your body for rest. Natural alignment induces more blood flow & better circulation, helping you to relax. Such feeling lulls your entire body to relax.3. Gentle & gradual traction & stretchGentle stretch is always better than sudden and aggressive treatment. Slow & Steady!C-REST PILLOW improves neck posture for those with aches, pain, discomfort or anything in between. While you just lie down and relax, it naturally restores your neck curves (a.k.a cervical lordosis), relieving stress, tension, poor sleep, tension headaches, migraines and more... 4. Pressure relief with amazing touch & feelC-REST PILLOW precisely contours to provide targeted pressure relief. The ""Just-Right"" Responsiveness of C-REST PILLOW cells to align your neck spines in the most natural possible, with no disruptions or resistances.To sum up, ""The Perfect Balance of Soft and Firm - Comfort & Support."" That's me!5. Improve PostureDecompression with C-REST PILLOW should happen in as little as 10-15 minutes a day - for less than the cost of a single physical therapy or chiropractic session. Consistency over expensive treatments. (Bonus: You can enjoy it virtually anywhere- on the floor, bed, sofa, yoga mat, and so on.) Good posture boosts your mood, confidence, motivation and overall health.6. One Size Fits AllUnique Polygon Design is built to Fit Your Neck Perfectly. These curves and edges make a huge difference. Our Advanced Ergonomic Design is adaptable to any neck shape and posture. Our unique polygon structure combines perfect fit, stability, and ergonomic support. With C-REST PILLOW, we want to make sure that not a single person is excluded because of his or her neck proportions, height, and weight. One size fits most, maybe all.7. It's water-proofWipe it down with damp cloth to clean, or just dunk it in water. Will it float?Also, it's made of INTEGRAL SKINFOAM, it's tough enough to handle everyday tumble. It wicks moisture/water, so it can be cleaned with a simple wipe down. It's light, portable and flexible. Simple to set up: bed, floor, soft, literally anywhere!  1. Side to Side, Up and DownAs you guessed by now, we made C-REST PILLOW as easy & intuitive as possible. No instructions needed. It just works. Align yourself with confidence and rest is assured. Once you get used to it, just move up & down or side to side as seen below: 2. So Easy, it’s Almost FunDuring C-REST PILLOW, you should take a deep breathe and move side to side or up and down if you like. Whether you like to read a book or play on a phone, just give yourself 10-15 minutes. You can assume any positions... but try not to fall asleep. You may drop a phone in your face.Why?

<p>What Is Anywhere Warrior?</p>
<p>It’s a fitness mentality that you could conquer any challenge at anytime, anywhere. The idea came from a love of the great outdoors, obstacle course racing, and the spirit of adventure. AW is personal training designed to get you the results you require. With Anywhere Warrior you get attention to fine detail, a well thought out and specific workout of the day to blast your body into shape and leave feeing accomplished.</p>
<p>WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT?</p>
<p>The difference is a holistic approach to your workout. Each day has its own focus and will incorporate some cardiovascular challenges and strength building leaving you feeling like a champion leaving the arena! Years of experience with all types of clients allows me to bring insight and knowledge to your unique situation regardless of fitness level.</p>
<p>Programming is topped off with a fun hiking adventure every other Saturday morning named <strong>TrailX! </strong>On a TrailX experience we hike to different locations and checkpoints in a loop fashion, in which we complete a circuit workout to add a step up to our walk in the park! These have been incredible experiences where you bond through battle with your friends and leave feeling focused and ready to take on the weekend!</p>
<p>What are you trying to achieve?</p>
<p>Anywhere Warrior was born during the pandemic and now is the time for a full brick and mortar. With a brand new, clean, locally owned facility you can get personalized training that is effective for you. Everyone deserves to live a long life. Cardiovascular disease is the most preventable cause of death. I want to give Livermore a fun-box of equipment to get a uniquely functional and fun workout.</p>
<p>From here we can organize on a larger scale to create fundraising events for local charities and noble causes that benefit the local community. My personal belief and goal is to cause the most benefit to the greatest number of people that I can. It begins with improving your fitness, so you’re prepared for anything life has in store for you.</p>
<p>Why Is this important?</p>
<p>Creating a space that brings the community together as a force for good. I plan to have a series of fitness events that will benefit local charities including, Shepards Gate, Tri-Valley Haven, Brain Cancer research funding. The time for growth is now and this will be a very impactful pillar of the community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What we need is the start up capital for the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Initial rent for the location,</li>
<li>Equipment and that includes:</li>
</ol>
<p>Power Racks, Barbells, Plates, Slamballs, Med Balls, Inertia Waves, Assault Bikes, Cardio Ergometers, yoga mats, padded flooring and rubber flooring, battle ropes, stability balls, yoga mats, benches, weighted sleds, punching bags of all shapes, Jump ropes, dumbbells, kettlebells, climbing ropes, sand bags, peg board or rock wall for bouldering and grip strength, warped wall, Olympic rings.</p>
<p>Good News, number 1, rent for the location is covered!<br/>The building is currently in a bare state, studs and plywood. There is currently a $40 per sq/ft allowance for Tennant Improvements from the landlord / developer. The location is 1750 sq/ft, off the bat, there is $70,000 allowance to cover a buildout of bathrooms, floors, walls, paint, etc  </p>
<p>ALL FUNDRAISING WILL GO TOWARDS equipment and installation, future rent, and program development to expand the TrailX series and more sport specific clubs and activities such as cycling, backpacking, kayaking, paddle boarding, and many more. Enthusiasts and Novices can get together to form lasting friendships and explore hobbies together.</p>

<p>There will be challenges along the way. Those that I see in the future are going to be permit requirements, Shipping delays, city approval.

</div></div>","What Is Anywhere Warrior?
It’s a fitness mentality that you could conquer any challenge at anytime, anywhere. The idea came from a love of the great outdoors, obstacle course racing, and the spirit of adventure. AW is personal training designed to get you the results you require. With Anywhere Warrior you get attention to fine detail, a well thought out and specific workout of the day to blast your body into shape and leave feeing accomplished.
WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT?
The difference is a holistic approach to your workout. Each day has its own focus and will incorporate some cardiovascular challenges and strength building leaving you feeling like a champion leaving the arena! Years of experience with all types of clients allows me to bring insight and knowledge to your unique situation regardless of fitness level.
Programming is topped off with a fun hiking adventure every other Saturday morning named TrailX! On a TrailX experience we hike to different locations and checkpoints in a loop fashion, in which we complete a circuit workout to add a step up to our walk in the park! These have been incredible experiences where you bond through battle with your friends and leave feeling focused and ready to take on the weekend!
What are you trying to achieve?
Anywhere Warrior was born during the pandemic and now is the time for a full brick and mortar. With a brand new, clean, locally owned facility you can get personalized training that is effective for you. Everyone deserves to live a long life. Cardiovascular disease is the most preventable cause of death. I want to give Livermore a fun-box of equipment to get a uniquely functional and fun workout.
From here we can organize on a larger scale to create fundraising events for local charities and noble causes that benefit the local community. My personal belief and goal is to cause the most benefit to the greatest number of people that I can. It begins with improving your fitness, so you’re prepared for anything life has in store for you.
Why Is this important?
Creating a space that brings the community together as a force for good. I plan to have a series of fitness events that will benefit local charities including, Shepards Gate, Tri-Valley Haven, Brain Cancer research funding. The time for growth is now and this will be a very impactful pillar of the community.
 
What we need is the start up capital for the following.

Initial rent for the location,
Equipment and that includes:

Power Racks, Barbells, Plates, Slamballs, Med Balls, Inertia Waves, Assault Bikes, Cardio Ergometers, yoga mats, padded flooring and rubber flooring, battle ropes, stability balls, yoga mats, benches, weighted sleds, punching bags of all shapes, Jump ropes, dumbbells, kettlebells, climbing ropes, sand bags, peg board or rock wall for bouldering and grip strength, warped wall, Olympic rings.
Good News, number 1, rent for the location is covered!The building is currently in a bare state, studs and plywood. There is currently a $40 per sq/ft allowance for Tennant Improvements from the landlord / developer. The location is 1750 sq/ft, off the bat, there is $70,000 allowance to cover a buildout of bathrooms, floors, walls, paint, etc  
ALL FUNDRAISING WILL GO TOWARDS equipment and installation, future rent, and program development to expand the TrailX series and more sport specific clubs and activities such as cycling, backpacking, kayaking, paddle boarding, and many more. Enthusiasts and Novices can get together to form lasting friendships and explore hobbies together.
What makes us unique is you will have a passionate lead coach who knows how to put the phone down.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">SportsLync - the story</span></h3>
<p>Jay Field was 12 years old and already 6 feet tall when he decided he wanted to be a pro basketball player. By the time he was a freshman, he was already catching the attention of college coaches and recruiters. But his family's financial situation caused him to move from state to state. Growing up in a household living on less than $1,300 a month, there were times where he wasn’t sure he’d ever have the opportunity to play pro, and times where he didn’t even know if his family would have enough to eat. </p>
<p>But Jay kept pouring his heart and skill onto the court. He played basketball in high school and continued in junior college. Because of his family’s financial situation and with an understanding that many athletes suffer financially soon after retirement, Jay pursued a career in finance. In 2015, he launched his own sports agency. Managing top talent around the world, Jay never forgot his dreams of playing pro basketball. He knew he wasn’t the only athlete out there who had the skill but lacked the opportunity to pursue their dreams. So he put his business talent to work for his sports passion -- and he created a platform to give athletes, coaches and fans the chance to be seen and heard, and more importantly, to tell their stories. Our story begins with a high school freshman athlete who got lost in the shuffle -- and it turns into SportsLync.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Need </h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $25,000. Funds will be used for SportsLync infrastructure. This includes continuing our mobile app development, legal costs and marketing. Our partners will not receive salaries from any investment. We intend to use investment funds to complete a platform build followed by brand awareness that promotes our platform as the leading digital platform for athletes.</p>

<h3>SportsLync Impact - The Recruitment Problem </h3>
<p>In sports — school, location, and stats are the driving force of how players advance to the next level. When it comes to student athletes, the market solely focuses on the top 100 players in the United States. This leaves a gap in the market, forcing athletes to turn to social media platforms to share their successes. While ideal for social networking, these platforms are not dedicated nor designed to build an athlete’s brand and sports career, nor to highlight game stats that are often left unseen.</p>
<p>Professional and collegiate teams often rely on scouts and word of mouth to identify potential athletes, which is inefficient, costly and outdated. The industry relies heavily on where athletes attend school to determine level of talent, rather than basing an athlete’s potential purely on performance and stats.  There are plenty of deserving athletes out there who aren’t being seen or heard. Enter <strong>SportsLync</strong>: a platform that creates an equal playing field and gives athletes the opportunity to be seen and heard – regardless of what school they attend or where they’re from. SportsLync allows athletes to create their narrative, input their (independently verified) stats, build their brands and share their stories, all while connecting with fans. </p>
<p>This is a gamechanger in the world of sports recruitment and that's exactly what we wanted to build. <strong>SportsLync - Opportunity for <u>every</u> athlete.</strong> </p>

It makes a difference.  If you work at heights, perform maintenance work or work in a workshop or factory, avoid unnecessary risks by using the endlaces® system.FEATURES Choosing the right size.Choose the size with the following in mind: - How much lace you need to open to be able to comfortably fit your foot.- Diameter of the lace.- Shoe size and look.Clarifications: -For a fine lace, with a diameter of 1.5 mm, the Model 25 will roll up to 250 mm of each of the strands.-For a thick lace, measuring 2.5 mm in diameter, the Model 28 will roll up to 150 mm of each of the strands.-A flat cord, when folded will fit perfectly into the small MODEL 25 if it does not exceed 2.0 mm in diameter. With a larger diameter, it will fit on the MODEL 28.-See examples in the project updates. USEIt holds with the desired pressure without discomfort, no matter how thin the tongue is, due to the design and flexibility of the base.  Pay attention to the ease of adjustment: 1) Insert the base under the cord.2) Push the button down.3) Turn while pressing against the shoe.Loosening them is even easier: Just pull the button upwards, it unlocks and releases the thread. We estimate that the time it takes to button and unbutton two pairs of shoes a day, could save you more than 10 hours a year, as well as avoiding possible untying with its corresponding dangers and more loss of time.  INSTALLATION Two assembly possibilities:1) Cutting the excess cord. (Quick and simple). 

 
2) Keeping the original cord.

With a simple touch of a button, you can select your temperature range and massage mode to reduce eye strain and discomfort and promote better sleep.After creating and delivering the original designs of Aurai to previous backers, we took their feedback and went back to the drawing board to improve our products. Vision Plus and Rio Plus now feature a type-C charging port that is more reliable and stronger silicone to prevent breakage. We can't wait for you to experience this new level of relaxation.     Our eyes are suffering — artificial lighting, blue light devices, daily stress, lack of sleep, and even allergies can all have a negative impact on our eyes.    Did you know that water-propelled eye massagers are more moisturizing and soothing than air-powered or infrared eye massagers, and gentler on the skin?  That’s why we created Vision Plus and Rio Plus — the world’s first water-propelled eye massagers that maximize the benefits of water-powered massages to help revitalize your eyes like never before.    Both Vision Plus and Rio Plus can be used as a warm compress to help soothe sore eyes, help relieve eye fatigue and eye strain, and work as a sleep aid. Vision Plus can also be used as a cool compress to help relieve itchy eyes, puffy eyes, red eyes, and swollen eyes.     
""Once you get up, your eyes are feeling so much better than they were when it started.""


""I really like it — particularly the hotter temperature setting is really on target to what I wanted in terms of using this as an eye massager, so I was really excited to see all of these significant changes with it.""

The fleas like me so much, leaving all kinds of little black spots (feces) and little white spots (eggs) on my body, causing me to grow some ringworm spots from time to time, and in severe cases, making me lose my hair.Thanks my papa for giving me the best bed ever - the Gentle Lemur® Pet Bed! It has improved my skin health so much that I now sleep comfortably every day :) 1. The mattress can be washed easily, and quick-dry by a wipe!  When dirty, the mattress can be cleaned with antibacterial detergent, gently wipes by towel, and then it is immediately ready to use.Bed cover can be hand-washed or washed in the washing machine. It's very convenient! 2. Patented TPU protective membrane - Antibacterial and WaterproofTPU is a special Thermoplastic Polyurethane with an extremely compact nano-structure. It works as a “protective membrane” to fully block the invasion of germs and parasites, which is the key to eliminating unpleasant smells. * TPU is an advanced and environmentally-friendly material that is safe, hygienic, lightweight and durable, and is widely used in many nursing appliances and sports equipment. The tear resistance is about 494kg/㎠ and the ductility is as high as 502%, so it is almost impossible for brute force to tear it.  It doesn't change shape or color, and it blocks out all stains perfectly.Even if some yellow stains are left behind, there is no need to worry because not only the bed cover can be washed, but also the mattress! 3. Pet body engineering design, suitable for a variety of sleeping positions (1) Caring ZoneProvide special care spaces to relax their joints, tail, neck and head. Reduces the pressure placed on their most vulnerable body parts. (2) Resting areaHolds up their head or legs when they need extra support. For instance, they are lying on their stomach with their head up in a certain direction. (3) Ventilation ChannelMaintain air circulation and keeps the bed dry. Cools our fur babies when sleeping in muggy weather. (4) Collecting ZoneIf an accident occurs, the liquid will be collected by the hole in the center and will not flow out of the bed. (5) Hugging AreaThis surrounding design gentle hugs their whole body and helps them to feel safe and secure. Kittens, puppies, big cats and dogs all the time lie comfortably on Gentle Lemur Pet Bed no matter how they position, their limbs are well placed in the friendly-supported zone.   4. High-density polyurethane foam mattressThe sunken design resembles a gentle hug also gives us a sense of safety and security.To maximize the effectiveness of the bed’s structure, Gentle Lemur Pet Bed uses ultra-high density (3.12 lb/ft3) memory foam for the entire bed to deliver strong support. It’s especially effective for aging pets and those suffering from arthritis.  Therefore, even for the same size pet bed, the maximum weight that can be supported by the Gentle Lemur® pet bed is far more than other brands of pet beds.The Gentle Lemur Pet Bed is designed with hip dysplasia and arthritis in mind and features firm memory foam and soft foam to create the perfect pressure point relief for your aging pup.Fortified with the resilient TPU coating, the memory foam can rebound instantly to fit closely to our pet’s body whenever they change positions.  And the mattress does not have obvious edges and sharp corners, greatly reducing the chances of being chewed.  5. Scratch and scrape resistant, super durable.The cover is crafted from an ultra-performance microfiber that is comfortable, strong, durable, and breathable. The design allows air to flow in and out between the cover and the insert and makes the bed feel like a hammock. Sleeping on it seems like floating in mid-air.With ultra-tough microfiber properties, the space between the cover and the insert helps to disperse and buffer the force from scratches and bites. The large arcs and wide curves shaping the bed, no edges and no sharp angles, provide our pets with little opportunity for chewing.   The microfiber structure also enlarges its overall surface area exposed to air, which allows it to dry in a third of the time as ordinary fibers. Therefore, the Gentle Lemur Pet Bed cover can even be air-dried in a short time without a dryer and fight the growth of bacteria in humid environments.  The back of the bed cover is well organized with non-slip rubber spots, and the hidden zipper can avoid scratches on the floor. 6. Specs and Sizes Guide  7. Reviews 8. Global Patents  9. My StoryMy name is Roh Kwang Soo, but you can just call me Robbin. I’m a 60-year-old South Korean veteran. Please forgive me if you find my story about my dream idea to be a bit too wordy.My company and I have been in the business of manufacturing and selling professional health and fitness equipment since 1994. My dream of making truly washable bedding started back in 2008 when I was visiting a pillow factory. It was an exceptional and amazing experience to see a free-flowing liquid swell up and transform into fluffy memory foam. What really surprised me was the fact that these memory foams could never be washed. After the day they are created, even after being soaked with sweat, covered in yellow stains, and full of germs, mold, and mites, they can never be restored to their cleanly original state.The idea hit me one day that why couldn’t we coat the memory foam with a comfy membrane to render both the cover and insert truly washable? In all honesty, I didn’t expect that realizing this simple idea would take me more than 10 years. Only after I tried, I started to be aware that it's almost an impossible mission to find a material that could closely fit the memory foam and prevent any exterior messes from entering.Countless tests of numerous materials and endless visits to research institutes, professors, and related factories made up a huge part of my routine life during the last decade. Eventually, I succeeded in making the patented TPU protective membrane into a memory foam coating and launched my first product, the Gentle Lemur® pillow.Later, I noticed that some backers mentioned in their comments that their Gentle Lemur® pillows were often occupied by their dogs and cats.Meanwhile, I had adopted an abandoned cat and an abandoned dog, and they loved to lie on some of the half-finished products I made.This further strengthened my resolve to make a bed for our fur babies. My company has now been through it all: concept verification, experimenting, 3D modeling, sample making, prototyping, molding, testing, and iterating. We’re confident that we have created the most caring and comfortable pet bed on the market.",49.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We all know that J-beauty products offer amazing skincare solutions: anti-aging face serums, Shiseido Treatment Essence, and Japanese sunscreen to name a few. But to get the products you really want, you either have to ask friends to buy them from Japan or you have to keep scouring websites because they are always sold out (or worse, no longer available).</p>

<p>We have built ourselves up to be a trusted source for J-beauty products and content directed to all beauty lovers. We made sure that all of the information can be accessed in one destination by publishing articles and reflecting our community’s voice. All products are carefully curated by our team of experts, and our curated products provide the best and innovative solution for you. We empower all people to feel beautiful in their own ways.</p>
<p>The minimalist nature of Japanese beauty regiments is especially beneficial to those who don’t want complex multi-step routines, desire a simple routine, and those with not a lot of time to themselves. </p>
<p>However, we realized that some of our audience are still new to the J-beauty world and struggle to find somewhere to start. With a large number of requests, we decided to launch our discovery box.</p>
<p>As a growing niche in cosmetics, we want to make Japanese beauty more accessible and raise awareness about it through our monthly beauty box.  Our goal is to let the world know that Japanese cosmetics are for everyone, not just for those of Asian descent.</p>

<p>Since Cosme Hunt is growing J-beauty's recognition in the beauty world, we want to create a Japanese beauty discovery subscription box to allow for more accessibility and awareness for Japanese beauty brands. Creating custom packaging and marketing requires a lot more work than our usual E-commerce operation, and this is why we came to Indiegogo.</p>
<p>We work directly with brands in Japan to ensure we get genuine products to bring to the U.S., and we want to do the brands justice with the perfect packaging for this discovery box. The simple, yet effective ingredients that Japanese cosmetics use have been utilized for centuries and this innovation can be easily overlooked by overly cute packaging.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>All boxes carefully curated by our team of experts</strong></p>
<p>Our curated box, that'll contain 5 to 10 staple J-beauty products, will help you set foot into the J-beauty world without choosing unmatched products or getting overwhelmed by too many options.</p>
<p>We also provide a mix of full-sized and mini products in our boxes. We understand that it can be hard to finish a whole product in a month, so to reduce waste, we’re opting to do a mix of full and mini-sized products.

</div></div>","We all know that J-beauty products offer amazing skincare solutions: anti-aging face serums, Shiseido Treatment Essence, and Japanese sunscreen to name a few. But to get the products you really want, you either have to ask friends to buy them from Japan or you have to keep scouring websites because they are always sold out (or worse, no longer available).
 

 

 

 
 
You may also wonder if there might be more Japanese beauty products that are revolutionary, high quality, and effective!
That’s why in 2018, our founder, Chloe Takahashi, started to curate the best J-beauty products with her friends and supporters to provide the best and innovative J-beauty products!Since then, Cosme Hunt has grown rapidly with over 30,000 supporters in our community and we’ve been featured by so many famous beauty media giants such as Glossy, BeautyIndependent, and WWD.
 

 


 

 
 
We have built ourselves up to be a trusted source for J-beauty products and content directed to all beauty lovers. We made sure that all of the information can be accessed in one destination by publishing articles and reflecting our community’s voice. All products are carefully curated by our team of experts, and our curated products provide the best and innovative solution for you. We empower all people to feel beautiful in their own ways.
The minimalist nature of Japanese beauty regiments is especially beneficial to those who don’t want complex multi-step routines, desire a simple routine, and those with not a lot of time to themselves. 
However, we realized that some of our audience are still new to the J-beauty world and struggle to find somewhere to start. With a large number of requests, we decided to launch our discovery box.
As a growing niche in cosmetics, we want to make Japanese beauty more accessible and raise awareness about it through our monthly beauty box.  Our goal is to let the world know that Japanese cosmetics are for everyone, not just for those of Asian descent.
 


 
 
 
Shop and learn with us
Since Cosme Hunt is growing J-beauty's recognition in the beauty world, we want to create a Japanese beauty discovery subscription box to allow for more accessibility and awareness for Japanese beauty brands. Creating custom packaging and marketing requires a lot more work than our usual E-commerce operation, and this is why we came to Indiegogo.
We work directly with brands in Japan to ensure we get genuine products to bring to the U.S., and we want to do the brands justice with the perfect packaging for this discovery box. The simple, yet effective ingredients that Japanese cosmetics use have been utilized for centuries and this innovation can be easily overlooked by overly cute packaging.
 
All boxes carefully curated by our team of experts
Our curated box, that'll contain 5 to 10 staple J-beauty products, will help you set foot into the J-beauty world without choosing unmatched products or getting overwhelmed by too many options.
We also provide a mix of full-sized and mini products in our boxes. We understand that it can be hard to finish a whole product in a month, so to reduce waste, we’re opting to do a mix of full and mini-sized products. In addition, we will cycle themes every month (skincare, makeup, body care, and wellness) so that the products overlap and there is less opportunity for waste.
 


   
We’ve also grown our community rapidly since 2018, and now it’s reaching 30,000 J-beauty lovers in the world.
 

 
   
We've been nominated as an Asian-Owned Beauty Brands and Retailers To Support by Beauty Independent and featured in top publications such as Glossy, WWD, Forbes, and more.

  We’re a meticulous, conscientious and detail-oriented group of clean freaks who learned the dangers of plaque and incorrect brushing, and decided we had to do something about it. We’ve been working together for 5 years to translate our love for all things super-clean to teeth and gums. The result is an oral-health solution that’s easy-to-use, comfortable and most importantly, effective. And after lots of tweaking and perfecting, we’re finally ready to share it with you all.We believe in supporting healthy habits and healthy lifestyles, and our goal is to make these habits easy to integrate into the daily routine. We’re committed to promoting oral health and keeping things clean- that’s why we created CleanFreak.

We filter harmful particles out of the air around you so as to help you breathe clean and fresh air.There are thousands of air purifiers in the market. To make a difference, we fully utilize the product size of an air purifier by equipping it with a Dual Coil Wireless Charger because in this digital era, we think most of us should have one or more mobiles and thus, a charging device is crucial for everyone.PURIMON Air Purifying Wireless charger fulfills people’s needs for having “fresh air” and a “convenient life”.Protect your daily life. Refresh your working environment. High specification purifying power PURIMON Air Purifying Wireless Charger is equipped with promising purifying power to keep your personal space free from harmful particles, including allergens, germs and PM2.5 industrial pollution. Purifying particle size from 0.3 microns We have 3 filter Layers providing a HEPA H13 level purification results:

UV sanitations are widely used in many areas to disinfect drinking water and sterilize air and surfaces.UV Light is invisible to human eye and it is divided into UV-A (blacklights), UV-B (sunburns) and UV-C (germicidal).      UV-C radiation is widely used in numerous disinfection applications at schools, offices, public transports, restaurants and even hospitals because it has been shown to disinfect surfaces, air, and objects and kill bacteria/ viruses in seconds.UV-C light penetrates the cell walls of microorganisms and shatters the DNA to make it impossible for them to grow and reproduce. It is a powerful germ-fighting function equipped in PURIMON Air Purifying Wireless Charger. How Plasma works? Plasma can be found naturally as the detergent of our Earth’s atmosphere by its effective power of breaking down many harmful pollutants.       Plasma is created when specific wavelengths of UV light react with air and it’s proved for destroying bacteria, fungi, viruses, yeast, mold, any allergen and other microorganisms powerfully. Besides this, Plasma air purifying function can eliminate all odors to keep your indoor area conducive for you and other people around. Dual Coils Speedy Wireless Charging Function  PURIMON Air Purifying Wireless Charger is a dual coil wireless charger providing a fast and wireless charging experience for your mobile and smartwatch.

 ABOUT US:LEGEND BODY™ is a team of fitness enthusiasts.  We are on a mission to make fitness training at home more fun, more effective and more affordable.  DEVELOPMENTIt was a few years ago when I was introduced to a new tennis partner. He was in his 50’s, but he was incredibly fit and he smashed every ball coming his way. Inspired by his fitness, I asked what his secret was. He told me that he does 100 push ups every weekday’s morning. The only negative thing, he told me, was that doing many push ups and playing lots of tennis together hurt his wrists. The idea of a new push-up bar that would not hurt the wrists sprung up in my mind.It took us a few months and many iterations before we finally came up with the Legend Pushup. It has helped tens of thousands of people stay fit and happy.   Back us today and join us on this journey to improve your health and fitness. IMPORTANT NOTICE: Please note that YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CUSTOMS FEES, DUTIES, VAT, IMPORT TAXES, SPECIAL DELIVERY FEES ADMINISTERED BY YOUR GOVERNMENT, AND HANDLING FEES.

<h3>
<strong>Why is the campaign important to us? Why is your participation</strong><strong> even more important?</strong>
</h3>
<p>The whole idea began with joining this war against the virus that has troubled us all. We did a lot of hard work, against many odds. But a good intention and an exciting invention idea can bring a product to a certain stage only. Beyond that, to take it to production and to take it to the world, to reach the people who need it, requires Teamwork, Expertise, Perseverance, Dedication and Funds. We now have everything, except funds! Therefore, if you see potential in the product that it can actually help you, and millions across the world, please do support us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get?</h3>
<p>We have already created the proof of concept of the product using 3D printing and other prototyping techniques, and therefore have been able to fine tune all the aspects of functionality, breathability, ergonomics, comfort, modularity, and aesthetics. </p>
<p>We need funding for the product's final material engineering, tooling and dies and the infrastructure for assembly and shipping. To begin with for keeping capital costs low, we aim to get the manufacturing done through other vendors.</p>
<p>Please do support the Multi-Mask or you can donate an amount of your choice, remember, no contribution is small!</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANTLY: </strong>For every Multi-Mask(s) that you pre-order, we will be sending you those Multi-Mask(s) AND we will also donate the same number of Multi-Mask(s) to an organization/hospital that has been supporting healthcare warriors but cannot afford these. We will send you a photo of them receiving it.</p>
<p>Remember, you can buy the Multi-Mask for yourself, your family, your friends or dozens for your workers or for a non-profit that you think will benefit from it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Multi-Mask can be used in any setting that requires a mask (and a shield for additional protection), and not just healthcare. In fact, every household can get it, because importantly, it's modular and therefore multi-purpose. The Multi-Mask can end up saving lives in sudden epidemics or pandemics like this current one. As a mask it can be used in cities with high level of air pollutants, and that’s almost every single city today. The aerodynamics of the shield are an added benefit for cyclists.</p>
<p>From the point of view of impact on environment, there are two positives: One, only the filter material is disposable, and that’s small, thereby reducing the bio-waste burden on the environment. Two, with the Multi-Mask, two products become one, resulting in less resources required to create products of similar specifications. </p>
<p>Our company Med Interventions and Beyond, Inc. aims to create many inventions and innovations that positively affect millions of people in the world.</p>
<p>We've been in Education and Innovation for a long time, Our YouTube channel ""d'Art of Science"" is a testimony of our perseverance and quality since 2014. In the first two years itself, we were among the Top 100 YouTube Science Channels in the World, and we were among the handful recipients of the global YouTube Learning Fund in 2019. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have partnered with CIBA ( Centre for Incubation &amp; Business Acceleration; affiliated to the National Department of Science and Technology) who helped in securing the Govt permission to work at their Maker Lab during lockdown and we are being incubated with them.</p>
<p>We have also hired the services of Ticket Design, a firm experienced in medical products and that has previously won Red Dot Awards, among others.</p>
<p>The Multi-Mask that you see on this page are prototypes and renders, so expect the final product to be even better built and more amazing looking. </p>
<p>We are not worried about the new developments in filter materials (reusable, washable, etc) as our design can incorporate any sheet form material easily. It’s modular after all…!</p>

<p>I’m a licensed clinical professional counselor who has been practicing for 7 years.  I have a diverse background that includes clinical work within the urban community and a business background that was shaped by an early professional career in corporate.  I decided to tackle this issue because the state of our mental health as a community is deteriorating.  Mental health services in Chicago specifically,  but not limited to, have diminished in the past 8 years due to clinics and hospitals closing or reduced capacity (funding) to provide mental health services.  The consequence of not addressing adolescent mental health extends into adulthood and impairs physical and mental health.  Therefore, this project is important to me because I believe that it is a part of my social responsibility and a commitment to my personal mission.  </p>
<p>Your cooperation and help with this project will increase users’ sense of well-being and higher self-concept, gain access to resources that help them cope with stress, and learn to articulate and manage their emotions.  As a result, users will be able to overcome adversity, handle difficult situations, make responsible decisions, and reduce stressors while positively impacting their mental and physical health.  Your support will bring an awareness to mental health access and fund the beta phase of the app, MChat Connect.  MChat Connect can be found on the Apple Store and Google Play.  However, the app has not been officially released.  After piloting the app with a small group there are needed revisions that will optimize functionality, improve visual layout, and include a HIPPA feature that will provide confidentiality for all online users.  </p>
<p><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></p>
<p>MChat Connect is asking for $28,000 to continue building on the beta phase of Google Play and Apple Store versions, add a therapist directory and add the HIPPA feature.  </p>
<p>The Coronavirus pandemic has caused major disruptions to the daily life of all especially adolescents who’ve had their childhood snatched from them.  Missing prom, graduation, first year of college, socializing with peers, etc. are all critical events that shape who you are.  There is something special about being young, something magical. Let’s give that moment back to young people and with the tools that help them overcome adversity.  </p>
<p>If our goal is not reached funds will support programs that provide mentoring to young adults and adolescents and mental health toolkits that have similar content as the app.   </p>
<p>The Impact – Although our pilot group was small, we were able to see improvements in the following areas in more than 63% of participants.</p>
<p>*Increase awareness and education around mental health</p>
<p>*Reduce mental health stigma and misconceptions</p>
<p>*Enhance self-help resources and connections to mental health professionals</p>
<p><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></p>
<p>As a licensed therapist working in urban communities I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with various multidisciplinary teams and work with youth and families that have experienced complex traumas and worked in diverse settings.  My plan for solving the challenge will be collaborative and the app will be coupled with trainings for professionals. Our approach will take into consideration multiple stakeholders input and capacity building.</p>
<p><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></p>
<p>If you can't contribute, you can still help MChat Connect:</p>

The Impact – Although our pilot group was small, we were able to see improvements in the following areas in more than 63% of participants.
*Increase awareness and education around mental health
*Reduce mental health stigma and misconceptions
*Enhance self-help resources and connections to mental health professionals
Risks & Challenges
As a licensed therapist working in urban communities I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with various multidisciplinary teams and work with youth and families that have experienced complex traumas and worked in diverse settings.  My plan for solving the challenge will be collaborative and the app will be coupled with trainings for professionals. Our approach will take into consideration multiple stakeholders input and capacity building.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why we created the FitCapsule</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hey Indiegogo, MotionFit team here! Thanks so much for stopping by our pre-order page, we're excited to be building the future of fitness with you.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The FitCapsule uses <strong>high resolution gyroscopic technology</strong> to collect <strong>3D range of motion data</strong> to help you<strong> improve mobility, limb strength, muscle symmetry all while avoiding injuries and overtraining. </strong>This is the fitness tracker that helps you <strong>hit that new PR</strong>, <strong>build your biceps / booty</strong> &amp; makes the fitness experience <strong>much more fun. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>MUSCLE IMBALANCES WILL RUIN YOUR GAINS</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Nothing will kill your gains faster than an injury and there's no better way to hurt yourself than to let muscle imbalances go unchecked. The FitCapsule measures muscle imbalances in each of your sets to make sure <strong>you're not at risk of injury and - subsequently - at risk of losing all your gains. </strong></p>
<div><p> </p></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>CHEAT REPS HURT MORE THAN THEY HELP.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Really? OUCH. </i>The FitCapsule doesn't tolerate cheat reps - <strong>lift to build your muscles &amp; strength, not your ego</strong>. The FitCapsule keeps the ego and cheat reps in check by tracking range of motion, making sure each rep you do is complete, delivering results and keeping you safe. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>OVEREXERTION IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF FITNESS FACILITY INJURY. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">No pain, no gain.... right? Wrong. Working out is difficult and it's not meant to be excruciating - too much of a good thing ends in diminished returns, and <strong>the FitCapsule helps you to know when you're doing too much of a good thing by measuring the fatigue of your sets. Strike a balance between over and under training to achieve the best results.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>AFFORDABILITY + PORTABILITY</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The only other exercise form trackers out there are the <strong>Mirror, Tonal, Tempo</strong> and other home workout technology, costing up to <strong>$1,500 &amp; a $40 dollar a month charge</strong>. The FitCapsule can be taken to the gym or into your home workouts and <strong>only costs $100 for a one time payment. </strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>OUR STORY</strong></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">MotionFit started with just Paul &amp; Andrew, a father and son start-up with an idea to track performance in our workouts. Over time, this small project evolved into a novel exercise form tracker &amp; worldwide community built on the future of fitness. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">As we realized the potential of this idea -<strong> a wearable for form, muscle imbalances and fatigue</strong> - we started to reach out to talented people we knew, which has now grown into the MotionFit Team - a group of 10 people with engineers, kinematic researchers and innovators working across mechanical, electrical, software, and app development. <strong>We've spent the past 2 years working together, creating our vision and inspiring people to chase a better version of themselves in our journey to build the FitCapsule. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> The FitCapsule was designed to deliver a fun, instructive and intuitive experience that helps the millions of people who are haunted by self doubt in their fitness journey. The FitCapsule is for the people who ask themselves:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>""Am I doing this right?"" </strong></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>""Will I hurt myself doing this?""</strong></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>""I don't know what workouts to do or how to do them correctly"" </strong></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We're building the FitCapsule for the people who want to achieve a healthier version of themselves and who are looking for guidance in their journey of becoming that person.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Simply put - step tracking won't get you those abs you want, heart rate data won't make you jump higher or move faster and calorie tracking won't build you the body of your dreams. Most importantly, none of these data points provide direction and rep by rep guidance. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We made the FitCapsule for the following goals: </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A newcomer seeking fitness guidance to make significant improvements in their health, wellness and performance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Athletes looking to innovate their training and get an edge on their competition.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">People who are enthusiastic about the gym and are committed to pursuing health and wellness.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We're launching this campaign to build the future of fitness with you. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Since the day this company started, we've been fueled by the ideas of the people who support our mission. Now that we're 90% finished with the FitCapsule, we're asking for your support through the last push of our development. Your contribution and use of the FitCapsule will help to guide people through their workouts by inventing new metrics, tracking and displaying people's form with fully body tracking, and to build a community of people who encourage each other on their path towards a healthier &amp; happier version of themselves.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Every rep you perform with your FitCapsule contributes to the collective knowledge and guidance of the FitCapsule community. Every dollar contributed goes towards helping the next person to restore their energy and enthusiasm for fitness and self improvement. Every kind of contribution you make to our mission supports people's lifespans, helps people to discover their untapped potential, and removes the obstacles that keeps them from becoming the person they want to be.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">52% of people report that they skip workouts due to gym anxiety. COVID-19 has made going to gyms that much more nerve racking AND necessary for your health. The FitCapsule was created to help people break through the barriers of gym anxiety and self doubt so they can see how proud their friends and family are when their lifestyle changes become noticeable in their health &amp; attitude. The FitCapsule was invented to give people a sense of belonging in the gym and to guide them through the difficult unknowns that we face when trying to improve ourselves, and to surprise themselves when their hidden potential unveils itself.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">80% of people report that accountability is what keeps them from the gym. We think that's true to an extent - people don't need accountability when they love what they're doing.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The leading cause of fitness facility injury is over-exertion.

It was during this period that he discovered research that pointed him towards probiotics as a potential way to help relieve the chronic symptoms of  sinusitis.</p><p>After several years of research, he was able to settle on his own proprietary mixture of probiotic strains of Lactobacillus that, per his own biohacking and experimentation, helped alleviate the myriad symptoms of his chronic sinusitis.

You’re missing key probiotics, or the good bacteria needed to fight off the bad bacteria.Without key probiotics, your body is unable to fight off bad bacteria effectively. Instead, it has to fight hard to keep itself in balance.  They help your body find the balance between necessary and excessive defense mechanisms (aka all that pain you feel).Sure Sinus reintroduces the good bacteria, helping to balance your sinus biome and assisting in regulating your body's immune response.   ""I have only used Sure Sinus for a short period of time, but have already seen improvement in my sinus drainage and inflammation. This product has helped me overcome a severe cycle of infection. I am excited to see how my results improve with continued use.""Daniel M. ""I have already noticed a bit of improvement. So I think this program may work if I stick with it over the long term as this has been a problem of long standing. In any case it shows more promise than anything I have tried so far. I think that over time it may perhaps break up whatever is causing the problem up in the sinuses. I am hopeful and have ordered 16 vials of 30 doses each.""George P. ""If you have sinus problems, you simply have to try Sure Sinus. I wouldn't have believed it if I didn’t. With near-instant relief and a drastic reduction in inflammation, I could feel it essentially repairing my nose over the course of the treatment. After a lifetime of abuse from prior measures, this was unbelievable. Being 2019, I would have expected every solution for such a seemingly simple problem to have been already identified and exhausted. Honestly, I wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t used Sure Sinus first hand. I wouldn’t have believed my sinuses could feel the way they do now.""Samuel G. These bacteria produce vitamins and nutrients, boost immune response and protect against carcinogens and unhealthy bacteria. A diverse mixture is very important to a healthy biome.    Repeat this process every day for the full 30-day process. Depending on the severity of suffering and sinus symptoms, some users see results within 1-2 days.   The proprietary blend of bacteria is both more potent and healthier when kept cold. True cold-chain storage and fulfillment ensures the best results. Shipping price displayed is for the 1-pack option. One 30-day program is enough for the average individual. Users who suffer from more severe symptoms should expect to need more than 30 doses for relief.It is recommended to pre-order multiple 30-day programs and store for future use, should your biome becomes unbalanced again.Depending on your history and disease process, some suffers find further benefit from multiple doses per day during the rebalancing of the biome. Sure Sinus is more than just a probiotic, the company has created a platform that will allow users to have access to a private forum with doctors and sinus experts. The forum will allow those suffering from Rhinitis symptoms to ask any questions or concerns to medical professionals and fellow sufferers regarding their respective symptoms. The platform will offer a community for chronic suffers to interact with each other and professionals on an ongoing basis.  The forum will be live this year for the end of this campaign.   Sure Sinus was created after our founder found that his own symptoms of chronic sinusitis had become so serious that he considered walking away from his passion for business. Instead of giving up, he put his head down to personally research and navigate his way through the maze of sinusitis cures. It was during this period that he discovered research that pointed him towards probiotics as a potential way to help relieve the chronic symptoms of  sinusitis.After several years of research, he was able to settle on his own proprietary mixture of probiotic strains of Lactobacillus that, per his own biohacking and experimentation, helped alleviate the myriad symptoms of his chronic sinusitis. Marc had put together a combination that changed his life—an actual, tangible and consistent solution for just about anyone suffering from both acute and chronic versions of sinusitis.Since then, he has had his eyes up and his clear-as-day nose to the ground building out Sure Sinus as a product that is able to help millions. He set out to build a team, who have since commenced with research and product development. That team has built the product you see today that is available now on a global basis. Your product will arrive immediately following the end of this campaign.   We ship worldwide. See reward details for shipping costs. Prices exclude any local duties or sales tax.We plan to ship the product mid/end of October 2019. We will keep you up to date on our progress and the expected delivery date of your order. Actual ship dates may vary.By backing now we will give regular production updates and keep you in the know with everything.   *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. Not intended to replace current medical treatment. Please consult your doctor before use. The doctors referenced in support of the product are those mentioned in the campaign page.  Sure Sinus manipulates the sinus microbiome to restore immune homeostasis. Sure Sinus works to prevent dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, within your sinus microbiome. It works with your body to solidify the mucosal immunology of the respiratory membranes in your sinus cavity.The nature and composition of bacteria present in the sinus biome are important contributors to the development of host defenses against infection and allergic reaction. Data shows that probiotic supplementation modulates immune responses and can help lessen symptoms. Probiotics help your body find the balance between necessary and excessive defense mechanisms. Using scientifically-backed ingredients, Sure Sinus is primarily composed of 4 different strains of Lactobacilli. Beneficial varieties of this bacteria produce vitamins and nutrients, boost immune response and protect against carcinogens and unhealthy bacteria.The mixture of species developed for Sure Sinus are all naturally part of the human sinus biome, as either a keystone (has a disproportionately large effect on the community), a pioneer (are the first to colonize the niche after a disruption), or a dominant (a relatively high abundance in most people) species. The right mixture is very important to a healthy biome. The chosen strains have been found to be safe, and conducive to restoring your body’s sinus biome to its native state. Having a sinus biome that is out of balance leads to many common symptoms of both acute and chronic sinusitis. Scientific studies have shown that sinus inflammation is associated with decreased sinus bacterial diversity and the then collateral enrichment of specific sinus pathogens. The included species have been shown to competitively exclude the habitation of certain harmful bacteria.The probiotics within Sure Sinus primarily act through the production of antimicrobial compounds. For example, one included strain produces the protein reuterin, which acts as an antimicrobial compound by inducing oxidative stress in competing bacteria. The effects of this protein are aimed at eliminating competing microbes, giving the good bacteria an advantage in righting the biome. Intranasal administration is key in regulating respiratory immune responses. Probiotic administration directly into the sinus biome can influence the host composition and function via antimicrobial production, changing PH levels, or through competitive colonization.    Sure Sinus is based on revolutionary research into the composition, modulation, and health of the human sinus biome.Abreu, Nicole A, et al. “Sinus Microbiome Diversity Depletion and Corynebacterium Tuberculostearicum Enrichment Mediates Rhinosinusitis.” Science Translational Medicine, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 12 Sept. 2012, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4786373/Cope, Emily K, et al. “Compositionally and Functionally Distinct Sinus Microbiota in Chronic Rhinosinusitis Patients Have Immunological and Clinically Divergent Consequences.” Microbiome, BioMed Central, 12 May 2017, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28494786Mahdavinia, M, et al. “A Comprehensive Review of the Nasal Microbiome in Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS).” Clinical and Experimental Allergy: Journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology, U.S. National Library of Medicine, Jan. 2016, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26510171Ramakrishnan, Vijay R, et al. “Sinus Microbiota Varies among Chronic Rhinosinusitis Phenotypes and Predicts Surgical Outcome.” The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, U.S. National Library of Medicine, Aug. 2015, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25819063Vickery, Thad W, and Vijay R Ramakrishnan. “Bacterial Pathogens and the Microbiome.” Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America, U.S. National Library of Medicine, Feb. 2017, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27888914   Rainfactory is a multiple-award-winning crowdfunding marketing agency that operates as a marketing department for growing brands.

<h3>Customer Testimonials</h3>
<p><i>""I gave the first one to my mother who is in pain often, years and diabetes.  She slept really well for the first time in years.""</i>  - Brian N.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>""I was part of the early funding for Kailo on Indiegogo, Since receiving the item last month I have absolutely loved it and shown it to all my friends and family! My mother has told me that it has helped with pain in her knee that hasn’t been able to dissipate for years. So I have decided to leave her with my prized possession! I will buy another Kailo... I definitely can see the value in the little miracle."" -</i>Nick A.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""<i>I am a skeptic! I am no stranger to pain. I was accident prone as a child. Breaking, twisting and rupturing. At 17 I was hit head-on by a drunk driver, changing my life. Lots of broken bones, severe injuries, metal in my body and years of pain. Even now. I have had lots of things removed, numerous surgeries, ovarian cysts, varicose veins, miscarriages, and so much more.</i></p>
<p><i>And now Fibromyalgia! All causing LOTS OF PAIN!</i></p>
<p><i>So, when my SIL told me about this Kailo pain patch I was skeptical. Excited, but skeptical. A pain patch with NO MEDICINE, working off my bodies own electrical system with nanotechnology. </i></p>
<p><i>But then, I got to go try Kailo before buying it. Yipee! I walked in there hopeful to relieve some pain, but still in the back of my head thinking that I was going to have to be the one to tell these people it didn't work. And on camera! But honesty is always the best policy.</i></p>
<p><i>* Guess what?!?! *</i></p>
<p><i>IT WORKED!!!! It took a little while to figure out where to best place it. But then.... RELIEF! I have found relief from my shoulder, neck, hand, arm, hip and back pain so far. Not a cure, but relief.</i></p>
<p><i>I can now wake up in the morning not feeling sore, stiff and in pain. It has helped my quality of life. Finally some RELIEF. It WORKS. It's weird, I know.""</i> - Liza Burdette</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>""I used my Kailo for hip pain. I wore it all day and took it off to sleep at night. My pain did not resurface until the following evening. So the relief lasted for almost 24 hours. I have also used it for sciatic pain and it allows me to sleep at night in comfort. I think it is a wonderful product and I am so grateful for it!""</i> - Karen V.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>""I used the Kailo all night for a wrist strain that I've been suffering those last few days, and the pain is so little to none that I managed to sleep through it (without any medication) and it gives me a pain-free good start for the day.</i></p>
<p><i>My mother suffers from back aches every morning due to arthritis and sometimes, it takes a few hours to dissipate; placing the Kailo on her back when she gets up at the best place made the ache disappear in a very short time.</i></p>
<p><i>The Kailo also eases my lower back pain from sitting for too long; it doesn't make it unnecessary to do breaks to get up, do exercises and to have a good back position, but it makes the last few hours so much more bearable. I always have it in my purse, ready to use whenever I need it.""</i> - Delphine D.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>“I have a tear in my rotator cuff which has derailed upper body workouts for me for over a year now. I was unable to lift my arm for days after any heavy use because of the pain. Once I found the correct placement of the Kailo, my pain dropped from a constant 7.5 (worst = 10), down to a 2. and my range of motion has improved drastically. Best placement has been across my trapezius, between the base of my neck and the top of my shoulder bone. so far, it’s been fantastic. Recommend</i>!” - Nic</p>

</div><p>""<i>I'm just writing to let you know that I received your product yesterday and immediately started using it. It took me about 3 minutes before I found a good spot on my upper back. The pain went away within seconds. I have been suffering from </i></p><p><i>daily muscle spasms and tightening that was so painful..(it felt/feel like my spine was being crushed in a vise). This would happen daily when I walked for more than a couple of minutes, when I mowed the lawn, vacuumed and when I would lie down to sleep. This has gone on for over 4 years . MRI's , Xrays, chiropractor, massage therapy, orthopedist.. Anyway, you get the point... I have tried everything and still ..pain.

Customer Testimonials
""I gave the first one to my mother who is in pain often, years and diabetes.  She slept really well for the first time in years.""  - Brian N.
 
""I was part of the early funding for Kailo on Indiegogo, Since receiving the item last month I have absolutely loved it and shown it to all my friends and family! My mother has told me that it has helped with pain in her knee that hasn’t been able to dissipate for years. So I have decided to leave her with my prized possession! I will buy another Kailo... I definitely can see the value in the little miracle."" -Nick A.
 
""I am a skeptic! I am no stranger to pain. I was accident prone as a child. Breaking, twisting and rupturing. At 17 I was hit head-on by a drunk driver, changing my life. Lots of broken bones, severe injuries, metal in my body and years of pain. Even now. I have had lots of things removed, numerous surgeries, ovarian cysts, varicose veins, miscarriages, and so much more.
And now Fibromyalgia! All causing LOTS OF PAIN!
So, when my SIL told me about this Kailo pain patch I was skeptical. Excited, but skeptical. A pain patch with NO MEDICINE, working off my bodies own electrical system with nanotechnology. 
But then, I got to go try Kailo before buying it. Yipee! I walked in there hopeful to relieve some pain, but still in the back of my head thinking that I was going to have to be the one to tell these people it didn't work. And on camera! But honesty is always the best policy.
* Guess what?!?! *
IT WORKED!!!! It took a little while to figure out where to best place it. But then.... RELIEF! I have found relief from my shoulder, neck, hand, arm, hip and back pain so far. Not a cure, but relief.
I can now wake up in the morning not feeling sore, stiff and in pain. It has helped my quality of life. Finally some RELIEF. It WORKS. It's weird, I know."" - Liza Burdette
 
""I used my Kailo for hip pain. I wore it all day and took it off to sleep at night. My pain did not resurface until the following evening. So the relief lasted for almost 24 hours. I have also used it for sciatic pain and it allows me to sleep at night in comfort. I think it is a wonderful product and I am so grateful for it!"" - Karen V.
 
""I used the Kailo all night for a wrist strain that I've been suffering those last few days, and the pain is so little to none that I managed to sleep through it (without any medication) and it gives me a pain-free good start for the day.
My mother suffers from back aches every morning due to arthritis and sometimes, it takes a few hours to dissipate; placing the Kailo on her back when she gets up at the best place made the ache disappear in a very short time.
The Kailo also eases my lower back pain from sitting for too long; it doesn't make it unnecessary to do breaks to get up, do exercises and to have a good back position, but it makes the last few hours so much more bearable. I always have it in my purse, ready to use whenever I need it."" - Delphine D.
 
“I have a tear in my rotator cuff which has derailed upper body workouts for me for over a year now. I was unable to lift my arm for days after any heavy use because of the pain. Once I found the correct placement of the Kailo, my pain dropped from a constant 7.5 (worst = 10), down to a 2. and my range of motion has improved drastically. Best placement has been across my trapezius, between the base of my neck and the top of my shoulder bone. so far, it’s been fantastic. Recommend!” - Nic
 
""I'm just writing to let you know that I received your product yesterday and immediately started using it. It took me about 3 minutes before I found a good spot on my upper back. The pain went away within seconds. I have been suffering from daily muscle spasms and tightening that was so painful..(it felt/feel like my spine was being crushed in a vise). This would happen daily when I walked for more than a couple of minutes, when I mowed the lawn, vacuumed and when I would lie down to sleep. This has gone on for over 4 years . MRI's , Xrays, chiropractor, massage therapy, orthopedist.. Anyway, you get the point... I have tried everything and still ..pain. I know that your product isn't fixing the issue, but it has (so far) given me amazing relief from the daily pain that I had been feeling.I have told several people about this product and I have no doubt that they will be ordering from you. Thank you so much for developing this amazing technology and delivering it at a reasonable price!!  I hope you continue to develop and improve on it."" -Michael   Electricity is everywhere, even in the human body. Our cells are specialized to conduct electrical currents. Electricity is required for the nervous system to send signals throughout the body and back to the brain — making it possible for us to move, think, and feel. The Kailo™ nanocapacitors work in harmony with your body’s electrical system like a bio antenna. You may even feel your Kailo begin to get warm as your nervous system responds. Now, once the pain and discomfort is managed, your body can get back to living the life you should be living.   Let’s take a look inside Kailo’s innovative, licensed technology. It was invented as a leading-edge antenna technology and in a EUREKA! moment was discovered to also help relieve pain. So what's inside a Kailo? What makes it work?   As long as your Kailo is properly placed, it will continue to provide relief. Additionally, there is a lasting effect even after the Kailo is removed. We have use cases of people wearing it for a week and the positive effects lingering for days after removal. We also have many examples of the relief continuing for up to an hour after just wearing it for a few minutes. It likely depends on the kind of pain, the health of the person wearing it, and the placement technique. Please contact us if you need help finding a proper placement at support@gokailo.com.      And hundreds of other applications!These are some of the most common applications, but we have thousands of use cases. People use Kailo for just about every kind of pain. Kailo has helped provide natural relief in joints, muscles, and nerves. If you are wondering if Kailo can help you, we have a 100% money-back guarantee so it won’t hurt to give it a shot!  Each Kailo comes with a small pack of adhesives that can be easily applied to the back of your Kailo for seamless application. When the adhesive loses its stick, simply peel it off and apply a new one for next time. If you don’t want to use the provided adhesives, feel free to use your favorite athletic or medical tape to hold your Kailo in place.   Because the pain relief is dependent on your body’s nervous system pathways, there can often be a little trial and error when it comes to correct placement. We’ve found that when a friend or loved one helps you, it can shorten the amount of time needed to find the right spot.Kailo is known to start working within seconds, so it’s fairly easy to know if you’ve found the right spot. Simply move Kailo around in varying configurations until you find relief, then remove the adhesive backing and apply it to that location. We’ll send a handy placement guide with your Kailo kit to help you find just the right spot.  Kailo is watertight and sealed against the elements. Feel comfortable and free to wear Kailo during adverse weather conditions, while taking a shower, or even during an afternoon dip in the pool. Kailo should only be cleaned with mild soap and water.   Because of the strength of the body’s electrical field, Kailo can be worn directly on the skin as well as over fitted clothing. We’ve even seen it work over sweatshirts. This means you have some flexibility of where you place it and how it works best with your activities.  Humanity has changed. Our bodies weren’t designed to be so sedentary but we now spend more time sitting than at any time in history (you’re probably sitting right now). Because of that, nearly every single one of us suffers from pain. And as we get older, it gets more common.  Standing desks, expensive chairs, gel pads — we’ve all tried them. Unfortunately, too often, the answer to pain is to open a bottle of pills. None of us want to be dependent on medication for the rest of our lives.

But all of us are surrounded by Wi-Fi routers, 3G - 4G, and soon the new 5G towers.They all relate to one thing which is ELECTROSMOG also known as EMF radiation (Electro-Magnetic Field). Everything that works with electricity or radio-frequency emits harmful electromagnetic waves.Every mobile phone's manual tells you to keep your device 2 - 3 cm away from your body. Have you ever read those instructions?The thermal effects above are easy to experience, but there are long term, invisible effects.People often neglect them while using their devices but we should keep them in mind and focus on prevention. Einstein Brain CardEinstein Brain Card is a pocket-sized innovation that effectively absorbs 5G & EMF radiation by its patented SHS-technology.​Our Einstein Brain card offers an all-in-one solution to your electric devices!The active layer inside is based on nanotechnology. This technology can absorb a given spectrum of low-frequency, magnetic, and high-frequency electromagnetic radiation to a healthy level based on research results and our measurements.The components of the card are made under laboratory conditions to ensure premium quality and consistency.The greatest advantage which makes our technology unique is that it does not limit the operation of your devices. Just keep it close to your gadgets and your Einstein Brain card will do the rest!  Proof of EffectivenessWe measured the EMF radiation created during an average phone call and used our card to prove its effectiveness in reducing that radiation.Important: Our card is not a shielding product!Shielding creates increased EMF radiation and could cause more harm than help.That's because shielding mostly just reflects radiation back from its surface. In other cases ""shield"" promising products should be grounded to lead away built-up charge.However, Einstein Brain Card works differently.It uses a patented technology that combines composite alloy with microorganisms that absorb excess radiation. The card can absorb a given spectrum of low-frequency magnetic and high-frequency electromagnetic radiation emitted by electronic devices.Unit of measurement in the above scenario: mW/m2 
Our Technology is tested and approved
Our technology is tested and approved by the independent Verkotan laboratory in Finland.Measurements were made in “cheek” and “tilt” positions on both the left and right sides of the phantom head. The phone's radiation levels were tested with our Einstein Brain Card and without it. The card has successfully reduced harmful radiation below the healthy SAR level, and by up to 64.8%.See the full report on the bottom of this page. [1]Early AdoptersAs an early adopter, we give you the extra advantage to protect yourself and your loved ones.That's why we would like to reward the fastest action takers.As part of our Global Launching Campaign, we created a special offer for Indiegogo.The retail value of the Einstein Brain Card is €150 per card.However, for a short period of time, we will allow you to get 2 cards with bonuses at a highly discounted price.The price is created for our global launching campaign, so take advantage of it NOW.This card makes it a perfect gift for those who constantly use electronic devices and if you order now, you will receive it within 7 - 10 working days. The 21st Century's intangible pollutionIf we could see EMF radiation, it would look like this:Most surfaces absorb or reflect electromagnetic waves.  Some waves are stronger and can easily pass through objects.  It depends on the wave's type, power and direction. The highest impact is always on the closest surface.Think about a phone call you make or an email which you write on your computer.Who or what gets the most exposure?Yes, it is YOU. The user and its body.Einstein Brain card protects YOU from the excess radiation by absorbing and converting the invisible waves to light heat. It reduces the potentially harmful effects on your body. Health effects of EMF radiationOur environment is changing due to constant innovation. And innovation is great!Although in the past 15 years average radiation increased 350 times... and new inventions like 5G networks, smart homes and self-driving cars are still just at the beginning of their development.EMF radiation has physical effects on our bodies.

What about 20 years ago?Manufacturing standards have barely changed since then, even though technology advanced by light-years.Mobile phones and Wi-Fi devices emit pulsed microwave radiation. Our bodies are mostly based on water and minerals. We function because it can successfully communicate via tiny electric signals. This is the language of our nervous system. On the other side minerals like iron can be magnetised.When physicians were asked about Electro-Magnetic Radiation, about 96% of them believed that EMF radiation can cause illnesses. (EMF Hypersensitivity research, WHO 2006)More and more people experience mild symptoms like headaches, muscle pains, ear ringings or sleep disturbances.In 2011, almost a decade ago, the World Health Organisation has classified electromagnetic fields as ""possibly"" carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B).See the full report at the bottom of this page.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi friend!</p>
<p>My name is Bergen and I've been the owner of Vibe Tribe Fitness for the past four years and have been a personal trainer and strength coach for six years. Coming from Bozeman, MT to the big city of Seattle, WA, I set out on a mission to make a positive impact on as many people's health and wellness as I possibly could.</p>
<p>I started Vibe Tribe Fitness back in 2017. Since then, I have built my business as an independent contractor, training countless hours out of other locally owned gyms, and that growth has lead me to this point. </p>
<p>In that time, I have gotten to know the fitness industry and learned how to run a profitable business. I also learned that there is a large gap in the fitness community that is in desperate need of strong female leadership.</p>
<p>After carefully researching my local area, as well as online fitness communities, I found there is a serious lack of female-owned strength services, and female-owned gyms are virtually non-existent in the state of Washington.</p>
<p>I'm dedicated to being a front runner in a new era. An era in which women are encouraged to build physical strength, and through that, feel empowered in their lives.</p>
<p>Our gym will specialize in one-on-one personal training, with a focus on the following:</p>
<p>1.) Muscular Imbalances</p>
<p>2.) Injury Rehabilitation</p>
<p>3.) Proper Movement Mechanics</p>
<p>4.) Strength Development</p>
<p>5.) Cardiovascular Conditioning</p>
<p>Our main goal is to help people build optimal strength through pain free movement. This will ensure that each of our members will feel safe, supported, and strong! </p>
<p>Personally, building strength has not only changed my body for the better, but has helped me increase my confidence in myself, and my ability to help others.</p>
<p>With your help, we will be able to properly outfit our gym with the latest equipment in order to give our clients the best results and experience possible.</p>
<p>Empowerment is what we need right now.</p>
<p>Let's build a gym together that is the definition of that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $30,000, all of which will go 100% to funding the equipment and renovations necessary to create a fully functional and exceptional gym experience.</p>
<p>In efforts to meet my vision for impacting the health of people's lives, I'm so excited to offer you several virtual fitness and nutritional coaching packages. Your donations will qualify you for these programs. I believe this will not only give you direct insight to our superior coaching strategies, but also personal results to your own health. This allows me to show you the benefits of what we do, as well as create further connections with each and every one of you.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are a current client, or not in need of virtual coaching, you can also donate freely just because you love our vision and what we stand for.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe this is what not only our local community needs, but also women everywhere. The fitness industry needs more strong women to stand in these spaces and help impact the health of as many people as we can reach.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that our gym will stand out as true professionals in our industry, and help create a movement more towards empowerment and encouragement.</p>
<p>Together, we will grow build a tribe this world has yet to see!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With any business, there is always a few risks and challenges that we face. Luckily, much of this is reduced based off my current clientele. </p>
<p>As stated above, I have had my business for four years and have developed a loyal and substantial clientele, so I don't have the typical ""Start-Up"" risks. The biggest challenge has been finding more space for them. Hence, our own gym is needed. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge we face is raising the funds needed to outfit the gym with the proper equipment, which again, is the reason we are raising funds through this platform.</p>
<p>With your help, and the help of our current customers, we will raise the money necessary to make this gym a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't in a position to currently help financially, THAT'S TOTALLY OK!</p>
<p>You can still help us out by sending this link to three friends you think would be interested in contributing.</p>
<p>Thank you so much friend! I appreciate you!</p>

Hi friend!
My name is Bergen and I've been the owner of Vibe Tribe Fitness for the past four years and have been a personal trainer and strength coach for six years. Coming from Bozeman, MT to the big city of Seattle, WA, I set out on a mission to make a positive impact on as many people's health and wellness as I possibly could.
I started Vibe Tribe Fitness back in 2017. Since then, I have built my business as an independent contractor, training countless hours out of other locally owned gyms, and that growth has lead me to this point. 
In that time, I have gotten to know the fitness industry and learned how to run a profitable business. I also learned that there is a large gap in the fitness community that is in desperate need of strong female leadership.
After carefully researching my local area, as well as online fitness communities, I found there is a serious lack of female-owned strength services, and female-owned gyms are virtually non-existent in the state of Washington.
I'm dedicated to being a front runner in a new era. An era in which women are encouraged to build physical strength, and through that, feel empowered in their lives.
Our gym will specialize in one-on-one personal training, with a focus on the following:
1.) Muscular Imbalances
2.) Injury Rehabilitation
3.) Proper Movement Mechanics
4.) Strength Development
5.) Cardiovascular Conditioning
Our main goal is to help people build optimal strength through pain free movement. This will ensure that each of our members will feel safe, supported, and strong! 
Personally, building strength has not only changed my body for the better, but has helped me increase my confidence in myself, and my ability to help others.
With your help, we will be able to properly outfit our gym with the latest equipment in order to give our clients the best results and experience possible.
Empowerment is what we need right now.
Let's build a gym together that is the definition of that.

What We Need & What You Get
Our fundraising goal is $30,000, all of which will go 100% to funding the equipment and renovations necessary to create a fully functional and exceptional gym experience.
In efforts to meet my vision for impacting the health of people's lives, I'm so excited to offer you several virtual fitness and nutritional coaching packages. Your donations will qualify you for these programs. I believe this will not only give you direct insight to our superior coaching strategies, but also personal results to your own health. This allows me to show you the benefits of what we do, as well as create further connections with each and every one of you.
Additionally, if you are a current client, or not in need of virtual coaching, you can also donate freely just because you love our vision and what we stand for.

The Impact
I believe this is what not only our local community needs, but also women everywhere. The fitness industry needs more strong women to stand in these spaces and help impact the health of as many people as we can reach.
There is no doubt in my mind that our gym will stand out as true professionals in our industry, and help create a movement more towards empowerment and encouragement.
Together, we will grow build a tribe this world has yet to see!
Risks & Challenges
With any business, there is always a few risks and challenges that we face. Luckily, much of this is reduced based off my current clientele. 
As stated above, I have had my business for four years and have developed a loyal and substantial clientele, so I don't have the typical ""Start-Up"" risks. The biggest challenge has been finding more space for them. Hence, our own gym is needed. 
The biggest challenge we face is raising the funds needed to outfit the gym with the proper equipment, which again, is the reason we are raising funds through this platform.
With your help, and the help of our current customers, we will raise the money necessary to make this gym a reality.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you aren't in a position to currently help financially, THAT'S TOTALLY OK!
You can still help us out by sending this link to three friends you think would be interested in contributing.
Thank you so much friend! I appreciate you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Gajo Makes Staying Hydrated &amp; Following a Healthy Lifestyle Easy</h2>
<p>In these challenging times of COVID 19, we need to stay on top of our health, and one easy way to do that is by tracking our water intake with Gajo. <strong>The Gajo pad and app </strong>can help you monitor your water intake to ensure you drink enough water each day.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621949457/njhasyns5fbltsqy0w4m.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Along with reminding you to drink water, the <strong>Gajo pad will track your coffee &amp; caffeine</strong> intake for the day. We all love coffee, it helps us get through the day or give us a kick in the afternoon, but according to the CDC caffeine consumption (up to 400mg per day)  is about 3-5 cups of plain coffee. Do you drink more than that? </p>

<h2>How Gajo Works</h2>
<p>Building a daily water habit is tough. That’s where Gajo comes in. It has a sleek design and fits naturally into your daily routine. Gajo is lightweight, roughly the size of a coaster, and designed to complement your home décor.</p>

Place the Gajo device on a flat surface like your desk or nightstand, then place your glass, cup, mug, or water bottle on it. As you consume your drink, the device graphically tracks how much has been consumed. It seems like magic, but it’s just a great design that helps you stay hydrated.</p>

<p>My name is Steve Stedman, a software developer, database administrator with over 25 year of experience with SQL Server databases. I am also a volunteer firefighter and EMT.  I have spent the last 4 years building Database Health v1.0, then Database Health Monitor (for SQL Server) v2 with 10 major beta releases so far.  I need your help to fund the next beta version.</p>
<p>The problem that database administrators and developers face is that over time their databases outgrow the hardware, and you are left with the choice of throwing money at purchasing more hardware, an alternate to that is performance tuning your database to run faster and do more with the hardware you have. Database Health Monitor helps with that performance tuning.</p>
<p>Database Health Monitor for SQL Server is a tool that database administrators use to get more out of their SQL Server reducing or delaying the need to purchase more hardware, while improving the overall performance of their database.</p>

<p>This product was built out of necessity for me. I have needed this product to regularly tune database performance, often times not being able to justify the cost of purchasing new database hardware. Often times in a large organization the cost of the SQL Server database may be in the $10,000 to $100,000 range and beyond. Database Health monitor helps the programmers and database administrators get more out of that database hardware investment.</p>

My name is Steve Stedman, a software developer, database administrator with over 25 year of experience with SQL Server databases. I am also a volunteer firefighter and EMT.  I have spent the last 4 years building Database Health v1.0, then Database Health Monitor (for SQL Server) v2 with 10 major beta releases so far.  I need your help to fund the next beta version.
The problem that database administrators and developers face is that over time their databases outgrow the hardware, and you are left with the choice of throwing money at purchasing more hardware, an alternate to that is performance tuning your database to run faster and do more with the hardware you have. Database Health Monitor helps with that performance tuning.
Database Health Monitor for SQL Server is a tool that database administrators use to get more out of their SQL Server reducing or delaying the need to purchase more hardware, while improving the overall performance of their database.
   What We Need & What You Get 
I am looking to raise $1500 (us dollars) to help offset my costs in developing and marketing the next beta release of the product. In the next beta I plan to do the following:



Development work adding 2 additional reports.


Bug fixing, both bugs reported by customers, and crash reports automatically submitted to the system.


Additional writing and development of help files and web content, at least 15 new documentation pages.


Performance improvements to make the program run faster.


Marketing to increase brand awareness.


Those who contribute will receive the following perks depending on the level of contribution.



Weekly email update for all contributors.


Early beta release access to all contributors at the $15 level or above.


Software license code to use the product to all contributors at the $25 level or above, plus benefits of the $15 level.


30 minutes of online training with Database Health Monitor to all contributors at the $150 level or above. Includes benefits of the $15 level


I have kept my goal here small, with just what I need to get the next beta done.  If somehow this campaign doesn't reach the entire goal, the funds will be split over the above bullet items with a larger percentage going to the marketing to increase brand awareness.   The Impact 
Over the last 4 years I have treated this as a hobby. The beta releases of Database Health Monitor have been run at over 1700 locations worldwide, with 300 of those using the product over the last 90 days. Database Health is at the point that I can no longer treat it as a hobby.
This product was built out of necessity for me. I have needed this product to regularly tune database performance, often times not being able to justify the cost of purchasing new database hardware. Often times in a large organization the cost of the SQL Server database may be in the $10,000 to $100,000 range and beyond. Database Health monitor helps the programmers and database administrators get more out of that database hardware investment.

Just downloaded your tool. It rocks! -From San Diego, CA


#DatabaseHealth showed 5 LongRunningQueries, …  a bit of Index Consolidation and execution time went down from 2 mins to 2 secs! Thank you for the tools! 


Hi, I think your project is AMAZING.


Just downloaded Database Health … So far excellent work and thanks for sharing with the community.


I really dig being able to view the code by double-clicking it in the “Debt By Object”


That’s pretty dang cool!  (Referring to the SQL Technical Debt analysis).


Excuse my language but that's ***** amazing - it's instant! Wow, good work :)


The entire application is so much more responsive, can't believe it. The new colour is fantastic too, really changes the whole 'quality' feel of the application.


First of all I would like to thank you for a great tool. I’m using it to monitor >70 instances and over 7000 databases.


Just downloaded it myself and gave it a try. Awesome program!


The software is really good, I am using very regularly to audit and performance tune the SQL instances that I administer. Managed to knock a third of a large SSIS pipeline's runtime just from using the historic waits section today.


You and your team have done some really nice work.


With Beta 11, I will be focusing on how to bring this great product to more users. The marketing budget will be used to promote brand awareness, and for advertising through search engine and social media marketing.   Risks & Challenges  
With this being the 11th beta release of Database Health Monitor, there are very few risks and challenges in the release of that beta, as I am not new to releasing updates to the product.
Where the risks and challenges exist is in the marketing effort, using appropriate search engine and social media marketing to drive the brand awareness. I plan to address these risks by walking slowly, doing small experimental marketing campaigns, measuring their success with the goal of coming out of Beta 11 with a solid reproducible plan to show if we spend X dollars on Y marketing, we will produce Z customers.

Globally, incarceration rates are at an all
time high. The costs of incarceration weigh heavily on government budgets and
more importantly, the statistics tell us that prisons don’t work. Going to prison increases, not decreases, the
chances of committing a crime. Overwhelmingly,
prisons are not rehabilitation centers but places of violence, shame and

<h3>HELMINTHS:  YOUR MISSING OLD FRIENDS<br/>
</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Who are we?<br/>
</h3>We,  Detlev Goj and Judy Chinitz,  are founders and CEOs of the two premier providers of <b>non-pathogen helminths</b> in the world today. Both our organisms have empirically shown that they are capable of training weak immune systems, helping to restore normal function.  We are joining forces in order to get government regulatory approval for these two kinds of non-pathogen helminths.  <br/><br/><b>WE BELIEVE THAT THESE HELMINTHS (HDC AND TSO) ARE PROBIOTICS!  IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOUR RIGHT TO OBTAIN THESE NATURAL PRODUCTS, AND TO GET THEM EASILY AND AFFORDABLY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, WE NEED GOVERNMENT APPROVAL TO MAKE THE PROBIOTIC DESIGNATION OFFICIAL!</b>
<p>Both of us came to the world of helminths through our role as parents.  Judy's son, Alex, is profoundly autistic and has suffered from a variety of immunological issues since infancy including inflammatory bowel disease and immune deficiency.  In his 21 years of life, very few things have helped...but helminths (Detlev's product, TSO) made a huge difference. Judy had first read about helminths and their proposed use in immune disease in an article in the <i>NY Times</i>, back in 1999, but for many years was unable to buy a commercial product.  When she was finally able to get Detlev's helminth, in just a few months Alex went from always sitting by himself in the basement, rocking back and forth on a swing, to being a happy and social boy who ran to the kitchen table to blow out the candles on his birthday for the first time in his life.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1426464/files/20150429122228-blowingoutcandles_.jpg?1430335348"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Judy then devoted herself to looking for a way to make helminths affordable and easy to get for everyone. Thus, in 2013 she joined forces with two others, an MD and a PhD, with the same vision, and co-founded the company Biome Restoration Ltd (<a href=""http://www.biomerestoration.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.biomerestoration.com</a>), which provides HDC (Hymenolepis diminuta cysticercoid) at a very reasonable cost.<br/><br/>
<p>Detlev's story is similar. Years ago,  an inoperable brain tumor was found in his son that was located right next to the hypothalamus wrapped around the optic chiasm. Despite  radiation therapy, the tumor kept growing. Detlev started looking into possible new options, one of which was the idea of an immunological approach. He was already working with live biological organisms and was the first to develop (along with his team at Biomonde, in Germany) a good manufacturing process (GMP) for live blowfly maggots, for the treatment of chronic wounds. Detlev searched the international medical database and found an article written by Dr. Joel Weinstock and his colleagues (1998) about their idea of using  the helminth, Trichuris suis, to stimulate the human immune system and teach it to attack the right targets - not its own tissue.  Weinstock et. al were working on inflammatory bowel diseases, but the principle idea seemed very logical and could possibly also apply to other autoimmune diseases. In 2003, Detlev sold his maggot business and joined forces with doctors at the University of Iowa, establishing the company, Ovamed. Tragically, his son died before anything new was developed to help him. However, Detlev then devoted himself to get helminth therapy approved as a medicine, established partnerships with various companies and initiating numerous international clinical studies with TSO. While the first clinical studies at Iowa University (IBD), Wisconsin University (MS) and Mount Sinai (autism) showed remarkably good results, following studies done in partnership with the pharmaceutical industry failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy.  This was  due to a change in the original formula, inactivating the TSO.  Going forward, Detlev's company, Tanawisa (<a href=""http://www.tanawisa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.tanawisa.com</a>), is producing TSO in its original and highly effective formula.<br/></p>
<p><b>2015:  new regulations should now allow TSO and HDC to be approved as novel food supplements.  </b><br/></p>
<p>Taking helminths to the next step - getting official governmental regulation of TSO and HDC as probiotics - is a cause we are both more than passionate about.</p>
<h3><b>WHAT ARE HELMINTHS AND WHY DOES EVERYONE NEED THEM?<br/></b></h3>
<p>Your body is

organisms that live in and on you. We have a microbiome, consisting of bacteria
and other microbes - and we should also have a <b>macrobiome</b>, comprised of more
complex life forms, which include a family of organisms called helminths. A<b> helminth is the native animal life of all mammals</b>. Our
modern lifestyles (i.e. our use of toilets, our highly purified water and food,
etc.) have led to a near-complete lack of exposure to helminths, which, in
turn, is responsible for a pro-inflammatory shift in the human immune system.

<p>Many chronic diseases were not present in our
ancestral environment, and are still absent in the least modernized inhabitants
of the developing world. Most of these diseases are attributed to a
dysfunctional immune system. Immunological diseases such as multiple sclerosis,
ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, type 1 diabetes, autism, lupus, and even
allergy and asthma, as well as many others, were conspicuously absent in our
ancestors. In a very real sense, these are man-made diseases. So what lies

<p>It is thought that, in the industrialized world, we

HDC (Hymenolepis
diminuta cysticercoid) is grown in the common mealy worm beetle. There's nothing to see when you take them - 1 ml of what looks like water and tastes like very salty water.  These organisms are considered MUTUALISTS - that means that you benefit and, in their native hosts (rodents), they also benefit. (In humans they die rapidly.) Up
until about 75 years ago or so, prior to modern food handling practices, HDC was
likely fairly common in our food supply, as grain beetles were regularly found in unprocessed grains.  HDC is still common in less developed countries even today, where grains
and other foods are not highly processed and frequently eaten raw.  <br/><br/>TSO (Trichuris suis ova) is the microscopic small egg of a pig whipworm.  Mankind has been in direct contact with Trichuris suis, ever since people domesticated pigs. Pig farmers today are often continually exposed to them.There have never been any reports of medical problems coming from Trichuris suis in humans. Like HDC, there's nothing to see - you just drink a little bit of a water-like liquid.  <br/><br/>In all places where people have eradicated these old friends, allergies and  autoimmune disorders are on the rise. <br/><br/>Taking HDC and/or TSO every few weeks replaces recreates a normal macrobiome.  In fact, there may be great synergy between our two products.  HDC live in the small intestine and TSO live in the large, so taken together, you have a complete macrobiotic solution.  Both organisms, as they're not native to humans, die in about 2 weeks and get fully digested like any other food - so, you just replace them once or twice a month.  <br/><br/><h3><b>WHAT WE NEED:<br/></b></h3>We need about 200,000 Euros (about $230,000) to get EU regulation of our two helminths, TSO and HDC, officially proclaiming them to be probiotics. <br/><br/>If we don't reach our funding goal, the money we raise will remain in a joint fund.  We will continue to work together to achieve this goal.<br/><br/><ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>THE IMPACT<br/>
</h3>How will getting official probiotic status for TSO and HDC change the helminth world for the better?<br/><br/>Lots of ways!<br/><br/>Firstly, we can guarantee that we will forever be able to send you helminths, without fear of governmental interference at some point.  Secondly, Detlev will be able to radically lower the costs of TSO under the novel food category as a probiotic, making a complete biome solution super affordable for everyone.  And talk about getting helminths easily - health food stores, supplement stores, etc. can start to carry these healthy products around the world!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>RISKS AND CHALLENGES<br/>
</h3>In order to minimize risk, we obtained an 18-page professional statement from a law firm in Germany that specializes in food and drug law and regulations.  This firm has confirmed that, due to better elaboration/clarification of the European Commission of the novel food category definition, it is now possible to get non-pathogen helminth organisms approved as probiotics. However, it requires hiring a professional company - a clinical research organization (CRO) or similar - to prepare and present the application to the Commission for approval. We then provided this legal statement to a well-known and reputable CRO in Germany, asking for their opinion. They entirely agreed with this legal statement and offered to develop and present this application for us. Last but not least, we have sent this question about  possible approval under the novel food category to the national German agency in charge of novel food applications and received an answer indicating that if the organism meets the requirements as explained in our legal opinion paper, such application can be successful. <br/><br/>The only remaining, and rather unlikely, risk is that the Commission may deny this approval.  In this case, it will be up to us to provide scientific evidence supporting the fact that both helminths meet the regulatory requirements, which we strongly believe that we can.</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>How can you help?

</div></div>","HELMINTHS:  YOUR MISSING OLD FRIENDS


Who are we?
We,  Detlev Goj and Judy Chinitz,  are founders and CEOs of the two premier providers of non-pathogen helminths in the world today. Both our organisms have empirically shown that they are capable of training weak immune systems, helping to restore normal function.  We are joining forces in order to get government regulatory approval for these two kinds of non-pathogen helminths.  WE BELIEVE THAT THESE HELMINTHS (HDC AND TSO) ARE PROBIOTICS!  IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOUR RIGHT TO OBTAIN THESE NATURAL PRODUCTS, AND TO GET THEM EASILY AND AFFORDABLY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, WE NEED GOVERNMENT APPROVAL TO MAKE THE PROBIOTIC DESIGNATION OFFICIAL!
Both of us came to the world of helminths through our role as parents.  Judy's son, Alex, is profoundly autistic and has suffered from a variety of immunological issues since infancy including inflammatory bowel disease and immune deficiency.  In his 21 years of life, very few things have helped...but helminths (Detlev's product, TSO) made a huge difference. Judy had first read about helminths and their proposed use in immune disease in an article in the NY Times, back in 1999, but for many years was unable to buy a commercial product.  When she was finally able to get Detlev's helminth, in just a few months Alex went from always sitting by himself in the basement, rocking back and forth on a swing, to being a happy and social boy who ran to the kitchen table to blow out the candles on his birthday for the first time in his life.
Judy then devoted herself to looking for a way to make helminths affordable and easy to get for everyone. Thus, in 2013 she joined forces with two others, an MD and a PhD, with the same vision, and co-founded the company Biome Restoration Ltd (www.biomerestoration.com), which provides HDC (Hymenolepis diminuta cysticercoid) at a very reasonable cost.
Detlev's story is similar. Years ago,  an inoperable brain tumor was found in his son that was located right next to the hypothalamus wrapped around the optic chiasm. Despite  radiation therapy, the tumor kept growing. Detlev started looking into possible new options, one of which was the idea of an immunological approach. He was already working with live biological organisms and was the first to develop (along with his team at Biomonde, in Germany) a good manufacturing process (GMP) for live blowfly maggots, for the treatment of chronic wounds. Detlev searched the international medical database and found an article written by Dr. Joel Weinstock and his colleagues (1998) about their idea of using  the helminth, Trichuris suis, to stimulate the human immune system and teach it to attack the right targets - not its own tissue.  Weinstock et. al were working on inflammatory bowel diseases, but the principle idea seemed very logical and could possibly also apply to other autoimmune diseases. In 2003, Detlev sold his maggot business and joined forces with doctors at the University of Iowa, establishing the company, Ovamed. Tragically, his son died before anything new was developed to help him. However, Detlev then devoted himself to get helminth therapy approved as a medicine, established partnerships with various companies and initiating numerous international clinical studies with TSO. While the first clinical studies at Iowa University (IBD), Wisconsin University (MS) and Mount Sinai (autism) showed remarkably good results, following studies done in partnership with the pharmaceutical industry failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy.  This was  due to a change in the original formula, inactivating the TSO.  Going forward, Detlev's company, Tanawisa (www.tanawisa.com), is producing TSO in its original and highly effective formula.
2015:  new regulations should now allow TSO and HDC to be approved as novel food supplements.  
Taking helminths to the next step - getting official governmental regulation of TSO and HDC as probiotics - is a cause we are both more than passionate about.

We used our prototypes to get customers feedback on what you are looking for, and it was clear, a headphone that has volume, that has an amazing sound and that feels good. So if you are looking for a pair of headphones that sound amazing, look incredible and are not bulky, then look no further!</div>

<div>Weighing in at less than 6 ounces, these headphones are the lightest &amp; most powerful sounding on the market, we use only the best materials in the industry including memory foam in the adjustable headband, to make them the most comfortable &amp; durable headphones out there. The headphones are also foldable and very compact, you can fit them in your backpack, purse or gym bag.</div>

</div>
<div>There is no need for an external amplifier with our headphones, we have designed our proprietary 40mm magnetic drivers to produce an incredible sound, with amazing highs, mid-range and lows that pack an amazing punch. </div>

</div>
<div>So I know what your thinking, ""another headphone company that is going to break the bank"", not here, it's why the line was created, because headphones you see for $299.99, just are not worth it, they are a fashion statement. We created these for you, the customer who cares about music, who wants to hear the crisp &amp; clean sound clarity. We created this line of headphones for everyone in mind, from kids to adults, men and women at an affordable cost with an incredible cause &amp; story behind the brand. <br/>

We will be donating a portion from each sale back to several charities and organizations, as well as donating a pair for every pair sold. After a near family tragedy, we decided that giving back to charity and organizations was what this company was going to be about. We have found that the power of music is a wonderful thing, when you are going through a tough time, music can be uplifting and bring a smile to your face, no matter what you are going through. We are changing lives by the sounds of music! <div>
<br/><div>We have decided to give back in any and every way possible with our ""Sounds for a Cause"" initiative. You are not only getting an amazing product, but you are a backing a company that truly cares and who is making a difference and helping others in need.</div>
<div>We have partnered up with the most amazing local and national charities out there. We have found by meeting with hospitals and organizations, that headphones are a need while you are staying there, so you can just listen to your favorite music or show and take your mind off of whatever is going on. </div>
<div>Everything from Childrens Hospitals, Breast Cancer Research, Military  Organizations, and many more. We are adding to our list daily and we are always looking for amazing organizations, feel free to contact us if you have suggestions. Our partnerships include:</div>

</div></div>","Introduction
Introducing, Earstorms Headphones, the most incredibly lightweight, comfortable and powerful sounding headphones on the market. We have developed a line of headphones that will absolutely blow you away with amazing sound clarity, bass & volume. Finally a headphone that looks good, that's extremely comfortable and has the performance of a true DJ quality headphone. Get ready to be blown away! We did not invent the headphone.....we just made it a lot better!!


The Company
As a dealer & distributor of headphones and personal electronics for over 10 years, we took the feedback from our clients and developed our own line of headphones. Our feedback from our clients, are that headphones are too expensive, and the sound quality and volume was not enough when used with their mp3 player, mobile device etc. Well the days of of overpriced & underperforming headphones are over! We are going to revolutionize the industry, by providing the best product out there that is cutting edge and affordable. 

It has taken us a year to get everything right, we tested over 80 different pairs of headphones, blew up more speakers than you could imagine and finally after working with some of the top engineers in the industry, got the look, the sound and the quality that is expected in the audio industry. We used our prototypes to get customers feedback on what you are looking for, and it was clear, a headphone that has volume, that has an amazing sound and that feels good. So if you are looking for a pair of headphones that sound amazing, look incredible and are not bulky, then look no further!

Weighing in at less than 6 ounces, these headphones are the lightest & most powerful sounding on the market, we use only the best materials in the industry including memory foam in the adjustable headband, to make them the most comfortable & durable headphones out there. The headphones are also foldable and very compact, you can fit them in your backpack, purse or gym bag.



There is no need for an external amplifier with our headphones, we have designed our proprietary 40mm magnetic drivers to produce an incredible sound, with amazing highs, mid-range and lows that pack an amazing punch. 



So I know what your thinking, ""another headphone company that is going to break the bank"", not here, it's why the line was created, because headphones you see for $299.99, just are not worth it, they are a fashion statement. We created these for you, the customer who cares about music, who wants to hear the crisp & clean sound clarity. We created this line of headphones for everyone in mind, from kids to adults, men and women at an affordable cost with an incredible cause & story behind the brand.

Donors purchase a low-cost DNA collection kit that provides both an Official Donor Card with a patented enzyme strip where you will place 5 droplets of your blood; and, a Donor Reference Card that you will keep in a safe place.  You will then place a small QR code sticker on both the Donor Card and your Reference Card.  This QR code is the only means of identifying, matching and sourcing your DNA in the Vivos vaults.  Vivos retains no cross referencing for any donor card, so it is impossible for either Vivos or any government agency to identify your Donor Card from the millions of other samples.  If and when you need to have your own DNA sample returned, you simply send us a photo of your Reference Card and the QR sticker.   We will then be able to match the QR codes and locate your specific DNA sample in the vault for retrieval. 


We are seeking just $100,000 in Phase 1 of our launch. To reach that goal we have packaged a variety of very affordable and unique perks so you can get your DNA into a Vivos vault, or even two vaults by collocating two samples of your DNA on two continents.  

What if you need your younger, undamaged DNA in the future and you failed to preserve it today? The consequences may be the difference of living a longer healthier life, or not!

Due to the scale of this epic project and that fact that the Vivos shelters already exist, the cost of storage is amazingly affordable!  For as little as $20.00 (a one-time fee) you can store your DNA and obtain the life-assurance protection that will be PRICELESS, if you ever need it in the future. There’s no better or more important opportunity in the world, then to have made the wise choice to preserve your life, before it is too late!

</p><p>WHO AM I</p><p>My name is ANGELO BELL and I am a writer, director and independent producer, and most importantly... a father of four amazing children. Life nearly took me away from my daughters, Israel, Cimone and Imara, and my son, Zachary. Thankfully, I was given a second chance.  </p><p></p><p>WHAT HAPPENED</p><p>There comes a time in everyone's life when they think about how things would be different if they were given a second chance. In December, 2014 I got my second chance. </p><p></p><p>Early in November I began to have these weird shortness of breath episodes. They kind of came out of nowhere. On my job I routinely walk 3+ miles each night, including stairs, so there was no reason why I should've become short of breath.  I'd gotten really good at exercising while working and I'd even lost about ten pounds.  Being a typical man, I pushed through my breathing problems even as my lungs burned and chest heaved. But in 48 hours everything changed.</p><p></p><p>Saturday, November 29, 2014 I went to dinner with my friend Isidro. We went for a walk afterwards. My chest started to burn for no reason and I found myself panting even though our walk was short.  The next day I went to work at in Westminster. It rained that all day and I had to take the bus home (car problems) so I wasn't thrilled. But things were different. Usually I was able to walk, climb stairs, even jog and little. Even though I'd have to take a moment to catch my breath, I could always move. But as the day went on and night approached, my difficulty breathing increased.</p><p></p><p>By the time I left work at 8pm and headed to the bus stop most of the streets were flooded and the idea of walking more than a block pissed me off. I made it home around 10pm and had to walk five blocks in the rain to get home. Now, just one week earlier I took that walk like it was nothing. But this time was different. I remember feeling like I was going to faint from lack of oxygen. I had to stop twice on my way to my apartment to catch my breath. I've never had to do that before. Ever.</p><p></p><p>At home I planted myself in my armchair in front of the TV. As long as I didn't move I was fine. Unfortunately, as soon as I stood, walked to the bathroom or kitchen I would literally have to stop and catch my breath. It was crazy! </p><p></p><p>Bedtime came and I was exhausted. I used a large beanbag cushion to prop myself up in my bed because lying flat made it difficult to breath. I remember my heart was racing like I'd run a marathon.  Eventually I fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>LIFE AND DEATH</p><p>Sometime after 2am I heard my roommate. I sat up in bed and then it hit me -- I was breathing fast but it felt as if oxygen was missing from that equation. I walked to the bathroom only ten feet away and when I returned my breathing worsen.  I tried deep breaths but that didn't help. Nothing helped. I wondered if I'd make it through the night. I couldn't breathe! I started to panic.</p><p></p><p>At that moment I thought about calling someone -- anyone. I considered calling 911. Nope, I didn't want to get embarrassed if this was a false alarm. Even worse, I wasn't sure if I could gather my breath long enough to speak to the 911 Operator. I thought about calling my roommate but I'd have to yell and that might make me pass out from oxygen deprivation. How long could I last? An hour? Minutes. Was I about to take my last breath at any moment?</p><p></p><p>But I told myself to calm down and miraculously, I did. I couldn't take deep breaths so I took shallow and rapid breaths. My heart rate slowed just enough for me to change out of my pajamas and into jeans without losing it. I figured if I was going to the ER I was NOT going while wearing my Santa Claus pajamas. </p><p></p><p>I called 911.</p><p></p><p>The 911 Operator told me to open my front door and sat down and wait. I waited in my armchair, not moving a muscle.  I heard the fire truck enter the parking lot accompanied by an ambulance. Seconds later eight people poured into my  living room: four firemen, four trainees, and two people from CARE Ambulance.</p><p></p><p>They took my blood pressure, pulse and blood oxygen level (oxygen saturation). They took my blood pressure three times, twice with the machine and once manually because it was super high: 206/107. My heart rate was in the 140s. I seem to remember my Oxygen saturation numbers being at 72 when they should be 96-100. They hooked me to an oxygen tank, and I could breath again. I was hoping the paramedics would simply stabilize me and let me go back to sleep. The fireman in charge said, ""No, you're going to the ER.""</p><p></p><p>I arrived at Tri-city Regional Health Center and went straight into ER. I was given oxygen, two IVs and an X-Ray. Something about some cardiac fluid being present meant my heart had been working overtime, and that was not a good thing. At one point they thought I'd had a heart attack. Diagnosis:  pneumonia and I was very hypertensive. They checked me in and brought me to my room. I think they considered giving me a CAT scan but because my insurance situation at the time was iffy they skipped it and opted for an ultrasound of the arteries in my legs. I stayed in the hospital for three days, was released with antibiotics for the pneumonia and meds for the high blood pressure. </p><p></p><p>I came home on a Wednesday. By Thursday I was starting to feel that same shortness of breath again. I texted my sister in law, a Licensed Vocational Nurse (LVN), for advice. I told her I wasn't getting better.</p><p></p><p>Friday I stayed glued to my chair. My kids came over and I only got up to make dinner and help with homework. But by 6pm I'd had two scary ""episodes"" of wheezing just by walking to the bathroom. My oblique muscles and abs had minds of their own. They would squeeze and tighten in spasms in an effort to squeeze more oxygen into my body.  My sister-in-law took me to the ER again where I had another oxygen treatment and they sent me on my way. </p><p></p><p>Unfortunately by Sunday night I was even worse. Any movement whatsoever resulted in a 2-3 minute gasping attack and now my throat was closing! During one episode I was so sure I was going to die I took the automatic lock off my cell phone. I figured that when my LA family found my body they would need to get in contact with my family back in NY and all the information was in my phone. </p><p></p><p>Luckily, I made it through the night but come Monday morning, December 8, I was terrified. I sat on my bed afraid to even go to the bathroom. I'd walk to the toilet and as I would pee I'd be gasping and wheezing. I called my sister-in-law again. I told her something is really, really wrong. ""Help,"" I begged. It's a good thing I continue to get along with my ex-wife’s family :)</p><p></p><p>My sister-in-law arranged for her husband to take me to a different hospital, the one where she works in Long Beach. She met me in the ambulance ER area with a wheelchair and took me inside. </p><p></p><p>While I was trying to stand up in the wheelchair and sit on the gurney in ER I had a terrible wheezing attack and the triage nurses saw it. My heart rate was in the 150s. Blood oxygen saturation was in the mid 80s and I was severely dehydrated. I got two IVs and fluid immediately. The doctor came in and said something to this effect. ""The pneumonia and high blood pressure I get, but we need to figure out why you can't breathe, and we will."" </p><p></p><p>From what I understand the blood tests showed decreased kidney function too, which made the CAT scan technician reluctant to allow me into radiology/imaging.  It was a risk to give me that dye they shoot into your veins. But my ER doc approved it and off I went.</p><p></p><p>HOW DID ""THAT"" GET THERE?</p><p>About 20 minutes after the CAT scan my sister-in-law and the RN treating me came into my little area. The RN whispered something in my sister's ear. Now, let me just say, my sister-in-law is usually stoic. She handles adversity like the best of 'em. But after the RN whispered in her ear... she started to CRY. Seeing her cry made me cry (on the inside). She said, ""Now we know what's wrong and we know what to do.""</p><p></p><p>The doctor returned, smiling. There was no more mystery behind my rapidly deteriorating ability to breath. He told me they found a massive saddle Pulmonary Embolism. It was choking off blood to my lungs -- both sides. I had no lower lung function at all, which was why deep breaths did nothing for me. I was sucking air into a part of my lungs that could do nothing with it. Everyone looked at me with astonishment. The clot was HUGE, I was told. I probably would have died in a few days. I certainly would not have made it to Christmas. </p><p></p><p>I was put on a Heparin drip and a ""clot buster.""  I was a good candidate for the intravenous clot buster because I was younger  and stronger than most patients who get it</p><p></p><p>I spent the next three days in ICU and then seven days in the Heart Center. I had an ultrasound on my legs which turned showed DVT (deep vein thrombosis) behind my left knee. This clot was probably the bastard that broke off and lodged in my lungs.   Turns out the whole blood clot in the lungs thing had some affect on my heart, which was slightly enlarged from working overtime due to the PE.  Over the next ten days I had daily blood tests, IVs stuck in either arm, and oxygen connected to my nose.  I saw a cardiologist, a doctor of internal medicine, a hematologist and a pulmonologist. It was surreal to have these doctors visit me and hear each of them make the same comment, ""Mr. Bell, it's amazing that you are here.""</p><p></p><p>I was released from the hospital on December 20th. My sister-in-law took me home. I was able to walk the flight to my 2nd floor home without incident. My 13-year-old, Cimone, came to take care of me. I made it home for Christmas! And thanks to the generosity of Santa's amazing elves, I was able to give my children an awesome Christmas.</p><p></p><p>MOVING AHEAD</p><p>I feel resurrected. A friend of mine said there's nothing like a near-death experience to get your mind right and help you focus on the important things in life. But it's hard to do that under the crushing weight of bills.</p><p></p><p>Now the New Year is here and I'm going after a fresh start. I need to be healthy physically and financially. Family friends and career -- that's what it's all about. </p><p>I didn't work for the entire month of December and first two weeks of January. I'm still not sure when I will be cleared to go back to work. Filing for Disability Insurance in California leaves you at the mercy of doctors and state bureaucracy. </p><p></p><p>I've humbly decided to ask for help. Thankfully my six-figure hospital bill is mostly covered as are most of my meds and weekly doctor visits for the next two months. But the month off left a huge deficit in my budget.</p><p></p><p>HOW WILL THE MONEY BE USED?</p><p>Simply. All the money raised will go to help me catch up on rent and expenses, pay uncovered medical bills, buy meds and buy some cheap clothes (I lost so much weight 90% of my closet stuff is too big for me).</p><p></p><p>I have been given a second chance. I don't look at life the same way now. In order to take advantage of the opportunities before me I need to  get settled financially and physically once again. Once I do that I'll be able to enjoy my children, my friends AND excel at my chosen profession -- PRODUCING GREAT CONTENT FOR FILM AND TELEVISION. This year I'm shooting a pilot dammit!   My project BROKEN HEARTS CLUB has made the rounds on TV in the US, Canada, Italy, Belgium and the UAE. Now it's streaming on Amazon Instant Video. My indie thriller, RESURRECTION OF SERIOUS ROGERS has been downloaded over 40,000 times from all over the world.  Last year a script analyst compared my screenplay, A PERFECT WEAPON to the Coen Brother's film, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.  In the past 24 months I've met with executives at NBCUniversal 24 times to pitch TV show ideas to NBC, USA, BRAVO, OXYGEN, E!, and ESQUIRE. </p><p></p><p>I just want to look back at 2014 and shake my head and whisper, ""You didn't beat me!"" </p><p></p><p>I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU :)</p><p>When you donate $25 or more you will receive a Twitter THANK YOU, a Facebook ATTABOY...

I'd gotten really good at exercising while working and I'd even lost about ten pounds.  Being a typical man, I pushed through my breathing problems even as my lungs burned and chest heaved. But in 48 hours everything changed.Saturday, November 29, 2014 I went to dinner with my friend Isidro. We went for a walk afterwards. My chest started to burn for no reason and I found myself panting even though our walk was short.  The next day I went to work at in Westminster. It rained that all day and I had to take the bus home (car problems) so I wasn't thrilled. But things were different. Usually I was able to walk, climb stairs, even jog and little. Even though I'd have to take a moment to catch my breath, I could always move. But as the day went on and night approached, my difficulty breathing increased.By the time I left work at 8pm and headed to the bus stop most of the streets were flooded and the idea of walking more than a block pissed me off. I made it home around 10pm and had to walk five blocks in the rain to get home. Now, just one week earlier I took that walk like it was nothing. But this time was different. I remember feeling like I was going to faint from lack of oxygen. I had to stop twice on my way to my apartment to catch my breath. I've never had to do that before. Ever.At home I planted myself in my armchair in front of the TV. As long as I didn't move I was fine. Unfortunately, as soon as I stood, walked to the bathroom or kitchen I would literally have to stop and catch my breath. It was crazy! Bedtime came and I was exhausted. I used a large beanbag cushion to prop myself up in my bed because lying flat made it difficult to breath. I remember my heart was racing like I'd run a marathon.  Eventually I fell asleep.LIFE AND DEATHSometime after 2am I heard my roommate. I sat up in bed and then it hit me -- I was breathing fast but it felt as if oxygen was missing from that equation. I walked to the bathroom only ten feet away and when I returned my breathing worsen.  I tried deep breaths but that didn't help. Nothing helped. I wondered if I'd make it through the night. I couldn't breathe! I started to panic.At that moment I thought about calling someone -- anyone. I considered calling 911. Nope, I didn't want to get embarrassed if this was a false alarm. Even worse, I wasn't sure if I could gather my breath long enough to speak to the 911 Operator. I thought about calling my roommate but I'd have to yell and that might make me pass out from oxygen deprivation. How long could I last? An hour? Minutes. Was I about to take my last breath at any moment?But I told myself to calm down and miraculously, I did. I couldn't take deep breaths so I took shallow and rapid breaths. My heart rate slowed just enough for me to change out of my pajamas and into jeans without losing it. I figured if I was going to the ER I was NOT going while wearing my Santa Claus pajamas. I called 911.The 911 Operator told me to open my front door and sat down and wait. I waited in my armchair, not moving a muscle.  I heard the fire truck enter the parking lot accompanied by an ambulance. Seconds later eight people poured into my  living room: four firemen, four trainees, and two people from CARE Ambulance.They took my blood pressure, pulse and blood oxygen level (oxygen saturation). They took my blood pressure three times, twice with the machine and once manually because it was super high: 206/107. My heart rate was in the 140s. I seem to remember my Oxygen saturation numbers being at 72 when they should be 96-100. They hooked me to an oxygen tank, and I could breath again. I was hoping the paramedics would simply stabilize me and let me go back to sleep. The fireman in charge said, ""No, you're going to the ER.""I arrived at Tri-city Regional Health Center and went straight into ER. I was given oxygen, two IVs and an X-Ray. Something about some cardiac fluid being present meant my heart had been working overtime, and that was not a good thing. At one point they thought I'd had a heart attack. Diagnosis:  pneumonia and I was very hypertensive. They checked me in and brought me to my room. I think they considered giving me a CAT scan but because my insurance situation at the time was iffy they skipped it and opted for an ultrasound of the arteries in my legs. I stayed in the hospital for three days, was released with antibiotics for the pneumonia and meds for the high blood pressure. I came home on a Wednesday. By Thursday I was starting to feel that same shortness of breath again. I texted my sister in law, a Licensed Vocational Nurse (LVN), for advice. I told her I wasn't getting better.Friday I stayed glued to my chair. My kids came over and I only got up to make dinner and help with homework. But by 6pm I'd had two scary ""episodes"" of wheezing just by walking to the bathroom. My oblique muscles and abs had minds of their own. They would squeeze and tighten in spasms in an effort to squeeze more oxygen into my body.  My sister-in-law took me to the ER again where I had another oxygen treatment and they sent me on my way. Unfortunately by Sunday night I was even worse. Any movement whatsoever resulted in a 2-3 minute gasping attack and now my throat was closing! During one episode I was so sure I was going to die I took the automatic lock off my cell phone. I figured that when my LA family found my body they would need to get in contact with my family back in NY and all the information was in my phone. Luckily, I made it through the night but come Monday morning, December 8, I was terrified. I sat on my bed afraid to even go to the bathroom. I'd walk to the toilet and as I would pee I'd be gasping and wheezing. I called my sister-in-law again. I told her something is really, really wrong. ""Help,"" I begged. It's a good thing I continue to get along with my ex-wife’s family :)My sister-in-law arranged for her husband to take me to a different hospital, the one where she works in Long Beach. She met me in the ambulance ER area with a wheelchair and took me inside. While I was trying to stand up in the wheelchair and sit on the gurney in ER I had a terrible wheezing attack and the triage nurses saw it. My heart rate was in the 150s. Blood oxygen saturation was in the mid 80s and I was severely dehydrated. I got two IVs and fluid immediately. The doctor came in and said something to this effect. ""The pneumonia and high blood pressure I get, but we need to figure out why you can't breathe, and we will."" From what I understand the blood tests showed decreased kidney function too, which made the CAT scan technician reluctant to allow me into radiology/imaging.  It was a risk to give me that dye they shoot into your veins. But my ER doc approved it and off I went.HOW DID ""THAT"" GET THERE?About 20 minutes after the CAT scan my sister-in-law and the RN treating me came into my little area. The RN whispered something in my sister's ear. Now, let me just say, my sister-in-law is usually stoic. She handles adversity like the best of 'em. But after the RN whispered in her ear... she started to CRY. Seeing her cry made me cry (on the inside). She said, ""Now we know what's wrong and we know what to do.""The doctor returned, smiling. There was no more mystery behind my rapidly deteriorating ability to breath. He told me they found a massive saddle Pulmonary Embolism. It was choking off blood to my lungs -- both sides. I had no lower lung function at all, which was why deep breaths did nothing for me. I was sucking air into a part of my lungs that could do nothing with it. Everyone looked at me with astonishment. The clot was HUGE, I was told. I probably would have died in a few days. I certainly would not have made it to Christmas. I was put on a Heparin drip and a ""clot buster.""  I was a good candidate for the intravenous clot buster because I was younger  and stronger than most patients who get itI spent the next three days in ICU and then seven days in the Heart Center. I had an ultrasound on my legs which turned showed DVT (deep vein thrombosis) behind my left knee. This clot was probably the bastard that broke off and lodged in my lungs.   Turns out the whole blood clot in the lungs thing had some affect on my heart, which was slightly enlarged from working overtime due to the PE.  Over the next ten days I had daily blood tests, IVs stuck in either arm, and oxygen connected to my nose.  I saw a cardiologist, a doctor of internal medicine, a hematologist and a pulmonologist. It was surreal to have these doctors visit me and hear each of them make the same comment, ""Mr. Bell, it's amazing that you are here.""I was released from the hospital on December 20th. My sister-in-law took me home. I was able to walk the flight to my 2nd floor home without incident. My 13-year-old, Cimone, came to take care of me. I made it home for Christmas! And thanks to the generosity of Santa's amazing elves, I was able to give my children an awesome Christmas.MOVING AHEADI feel resurrected. A friend of mine said there's nothing like a near-death experience to get your mind right and help you focus on the important things in life. But it's hard to do that under the crushing weight of bills.Now the New Year is here and I'm going after a fresh start. I need to be healthy physically and financially. Family friends and career -- that's what it's all about. I didn't work for the entire month of December and first two weeks of January. I'm still not sure when I will be cleared to go back to work. Filing for Disability Insurance in California leaves you at the mercy of doctors and state bureaucracy. I've humbly decided to ask for help. Thankfully my six-figure hospital bill is mostly covered as are most of my meds and weekly doctor visits for the next two months. But the month off left a huge deficit in my budget.HOW WILL THE MONEY BE USED?Simply. All the money raised will go to help me catch up on rent and expenses, pay uncovered medical bills, buy meds and buy some cheap clothes (I lost so much weight 90% of my closet stuff is too big for me).I have been given a second chance. I don't look at life the same way now. In order to take advantage of the opportunities before me I need to  get settled financially and physically once again. Once I do that I'll be able to enjoy my children, my friends AND excel at my chosen profession -- PRODUCING GREAT CONTENT FOR FILM AND TELEVISION. This year I'm shooting a pilot dammit!   My project BROKEN HEARTS CLUB has made the rounds on TV in the US, Canada, Italy, Belgium and the UAE. Now it's streaming on Amazon Instant Video. My indie thriller, RESURRECTION OF SERIOUS ROGERS has been downloaded over 40,000 times from all over the world.  Last year a script analyst compared my screenplay, A PERFECT WEAPON to the Coen Brother's film, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.  In the past 24 months I've met with executives at NBCUniversal 24 times to pitch TV show ideas to NBC, USA, BRAVO, OXYGEN, E!, and ESQUIRE. I just want to look back at 2014 and shake my head and whisper, ""You didn't beat me!"" I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU :)When you donate $25 or more you will receive a Twitter THANK YOU, a Facebook ATTABOY... PLUS: you'll get digital downloads of my best movies and screenplays, PLUS you'll be added to my private mailing list where you receive a FREE copy of any and every movie, screenplay or TV show I personally create PERIOD!

The money we raise will go towards the development of the online training program and the running of a study that will ensure that the program in its new format is as effective as its standard format. The study will be conducted by scientists at Baycrest Health Sciences, who believe that the structured format of the in-person training make it highly suitable for an online delivery. The online training will also provide access to an online therapist who will support the trainees through their journey.

<li>We're a small sports performance company, TITUS Human Performance, that has the solution to childhood obesity.  That solution is CHAMPIONS.  CHAMPIONS started in Tallahassee, Florida in 2006 and has had great results ever since.  My<span style=""background-color: initial;""> name is Andrew Lewis, I'm 25 years old, and I was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida.  I love sports, training, and have a passion for coaching and teaching people.  I moved to Tallahassee, FL in 2008 for college and was hired into CHAMPIONS as a coach.  Long story short, I moved to Orlando, FL in 2014 to start the program in two schools, Rosemont Elementary and Meadowbrook Middle schools.  We got great results this past year but were not re-funded due to financial barriers.  I recently got married on June 13th and my wife has a job opportunity in Jacksonville which we can't pass up!  We're very excited to move back home with family and friends.  Unfortunately, CHAMPIONS is not present in Jacksonville.  I love what CHAMPIONS has done for everyone involved over the years.  It's taught coaches responsibility, structure, organization, communication, team work, work ethic, entrepreneurship, and people skills.  With positive role models in place, not only are students taught exercises and games, but also awareness of their surroundings, making choices, and reflecting on those choices.  People need to make choices, not sit on the side-lines.  Leaders make choices and whether good or bad, they learn from it.  WHAT IS CHAMPIONS?   </span>
</li>
<li>
<p>CHAMPIONS is a
prevention-driven health and wellness program delivered to the
public school student population, grades K-8. This comprehensive program
is based on principles and techniques designed to improve gross motor
skills, flexibility, posture, strength, balance and coordination using a
long-term physical development approach to fitness and nutrition. Modeled
after collaborative, community-based wellness initiatives, our mission is
to bend this trend by encouraging a lifestyle of regular physical activity and
healthy choices.  This model is outcome-driven and
has proven to be effective in consistently normalizing BMI over a nine-year
period for a student population that exceeds 25,000 students, which no
other childhood obesity program has proven to do. </p>

Nearly 488 200 people in India die every year due to ""<b>Household Air Pollution (HAP)</b>"" caused by traditional smoky stoves( 3 stone fires).<br/></p>
<p><b><i>“Having an open fire in your kitchen is like burning 400 cigarettes an 
hour in your kitchen,” says Kirk Smith, a professor of global 
environmental health at the University of California at Berkeley.</i></b></p>
<ul><li>Poorly designed smoky stoves of traditional type emit CO,CO2 and 
Particulate matter. These enter the respiratory system of the 
cook(usually women) and aggravate breathing related illness like Asthma,
 TB , bronchitis etc.</li></ul>
<ul><li>More than 65% of households in rural India cook on biomass based smoky  mud-stoves (called chulhas) which not only consume people's health but also trees.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>89% of trees felled in India  for firewood.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What is the solution ? Introduce clean and efficient wood saving cookstoves in these  kitchens filled with carbon soot.</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>If people can't access clean cookstoves,it is because they cannot find a good one and if they find a good one , they are not affordable......</b></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How can we create access to clean energy (stoves) in kitchens for people who cannot even afford a proper shelter ? <br/>
</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Gift the women of Dhanushkodi 100 clean cookstoves? Yes ! They last longer than the kitchens!</h3>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why Tamil Nadu:<br/>
</h3>Tamilnadu-The land of temples  is home to many dialects and tasty food varieties. The tasty food varieties are made in kitchens with smoky wood stoves .<p>Tamil Nadu has a Household Air Pollution(HAP) exposure of 
150-200 micrograms of PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 
micrometres and which is respirable) per cubic metre of air — almost 
five times the WHO’s guideline range of 10-35 micrograms per cubic 
metre.(<a href=""http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/household-air-pollution-way-beyond-safe-limitsin-%20india/article5418834.ece"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/household-air-pollution-way-beyond-safe-limitsin-india/article5418834.ece</a>)<br/>
</p>
<p>Moreover, the monthly per capita quantity of consumption of firewood &amp; chips in Tamil Nadu(rural) is 19.27 kg which is marginally more than the national average of 19.036 kg.(As per NSS Report No. 558: Household Consumption of Various Goods and Services in India, 2011-12).</p>
<p><br/>This is a strong proof for the traditional usage of wood stoves in Tamil Nadu. Dhanushkodi , which is still a picture of vitage 1960s is not much different ! Only solar lamps have invaded the household space. The kitchens remain the same. Mud stoves have given way to cement stoves !<br/></p>

<span>தனுஷ்கோடி</span>,meaning
'end of the bow') is a forsaken ,ghostly town at the south-eastern tip of Pamban
Island of the Tamil Nadu state of India. A cyclonic storm with high velocity winds and high tidal waves hit 
Dhanushkodi town from 22 December 1964 midnight to 25 December 1964 
evening causing heavy damages and destroying the entire town of 
Dhanushkodi.The scale of the disaster left villages isolated for at least three days
 and without food or clean water. Communication lines were severely 
damaged and hampered relief efforts.  At least 1,800 people lost their lives as a result of the cyclone.</p>
<p>This deserted island is occupied by huts of fisherfolk who seem to 
live in isolation and with no connection other than jeeps to the 
mainland and their main means of survival seems to depend on the fish

<p>There are about 300 families near Mandapam at Dhanushkodi who need clean cookstoves. For this cookstove project ,the grass root implementer is an entrepreneur who has installed solar lights under the aegis of VK-NARDEP (<a href=""http://www.vknardep.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.vknardep.org/</a>) . The entrepreneur Mr.Mohanram (the old gentleman in picture below) will also help us identify the 100 needy beneficiaries among the 300 families.</p>

</div></div>","Can cooking a dinner cause death ? Yes ! Nearly 488 200 people in India die every year due to ""Household Air Pollution (HAP)"" caused by traditional smoky stoves( 3 stone fires).
“Having an open fire in your kitchen is like burning 400 cigarettes an 
hour in your kitchen,” says Kirk Smith, a professor of global 
environmental health at the University of California at Berkeley.
Poorly designed smoky stoves of traditional type emit CO,CO2 and 
Particulate matter. These enter the respiratory system of the 
cook(usually women) and aggravate breathing related illness like Asthma,
 TB , bronchitis etc.
More than 65% of households in rural India cook on biomass based smoky  mud-stoves (called chulhas) which not only consume people's health but also trees.

89% of trees felled in India  for firewood.

What is the solution ? Introduce clean and efficient wood saving cookstoves in these  kitchens filled with carbon soot.

If people can't access clean cookstoves,it is because they cannot find a good one and if they find a good one , they are not affordable......

How can we create access to clean energy (stoves) in kitchens for people who cannot even afford a proper shelter ? 


Gift the women of Dhanushkodi 100 clean cookstoves? Yes ! They last longer than the kitchens!


Why Tamil Nadu:
Tamilnadu-The land of temples  is home to many dialects and tasty food varieties. The tasty food varieties are made in kitchens with smoky wood stoves .Tamil Nadu has a Household Air Pollution(HAP) exposure of 
150-200 micrograms of PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 
micrometres and which is respirable) per cubic metre of air — almost 
five times the WHO’s guideline range of 10-35 micrograms per cubic 
metre.(http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/household-air-pollution-way-beyond-safe-limitsin-india/article5418834.ece)

Moreover, the monthly per capita quantity of consumption of firewood & chips in Tamil Nadu(rural) is 19.27 kg which is marginally more than the national average of 19.036 kg.(As per NSS Report No. 558: Household Consumption of Various Goods and Services in India, 2011-12).
This is a strong proof for the traditional usage of wood stoves in Tamil Nadu. Dhanushkodi , which is still a picture of vitage 1960s is not much different ! Only solar lamps have invaded the household space. The kitchens remain the same. Mud stoves have given way to cement stoves !
Why is  Dhanushkodi the project area?


(Picture : Thatched huts in Dhanushkodi ; Jeep & Vans :The only mode of transport)
Dhanushkodi or Danushkodi (Tamil:
தனுஷ்கோடி,meaning
'end of the bow') is a forsaken ,ghostly town at the south-eastern tip of Pamban
Island of the Tamil Nadu state of India. A cyclonic storm with high velocity winds and high tidal waves hit 
Dhanushkodi town from 22 December 1964 midnight to 25 December 1964 
evening causing heavy damages and destroying the entire town of 
Dhanushkodi.The scale of the disaster left villages isolated for at least three days
 and without food or clean water. Communication lines were severely 
damaged and hampered relief efforts.  At least 1,800 people lost their lives as a result of the cyclone.
This deserted island is occupied by huts of fisherfolk who seem to 
live in isolation and with no connection other than jeeps to the 
mainland and their main means of survival seems to depend on the fish 
they catch from the sea. 
There are about 300 families near Mandapam at Dhanushkodi who need clean cookstoves. For this cookstove project ,the grass root implementer is an entrepreneur who has installed solar lights under the aegis of VK-NARDEP (http://www.vknardep.org/) . The entrepreneur Mr.Mohanram (the old gentleman in picture below) will also help us identify the 100 needy beneficiaries among the 300 families.




What is left today are the white
sands, salt eaten ruins and a handful of fisher families who have made the barren land their home with thatch walls
& roof.
The primary source of water is from small aquifiers dug in the sands.The fishermen’s houses are built with
thatch wall and roofs without electricity, people are using solar panels, which is fixed
on the thatch roof for electricit.
Dhanushkodi needs a major upheaval for the world to witness a sea change through economic activity. The first step would be the installation of the TLUD charcoal making stoves and the Surabi wood burning stoves. This can bring a major change in the economic activity of the people.
The availability of casuarina makes it possible for the people to access firewood for fuel. As the village folks are economically weak, they cannot afford clean cookstoves. Most of the women in Dhanushkodi cook on smoky three stone fires and mud chulhas which cause respiratory illnesses in these women.The women of Dhanushkodi need clean cookstoves and only an external funding can help them procure the clean cookstoves .These situations can see the brighter side of life if the traditional 
,smokey cookstoves are replaced by improved ,efficient and low smoke 
cookstoves from Servals !

Who is the Project Implementer ?

It is Servals !




Servals Automation is a social enterprise involved
 manufacturing of different types of improved cookstoves as per the 
Indian style of cooking. 
Servals has been instrumental in setting up of 
one of the largest carbon funded gasifier cookstove program under Gold Standard 
Registration in Sunderbans ,West Bengal.

</div></div>","Moving organ donation matching into the 21st century
 
Hi , I'm Dr. Robert Moore. For over 25 years, working as a primary care physician, I have witnessed the anguish that family members and friends have endured when they are waiting in need of an organ donation. Although there have been tremendous strides made in improving the system of donor/recipient matching, it is clear WE MUST DO BETTER.
Our goal is to use social media networks and computer facial recognition software to optimize organ/bone marrow donor matching
 
GeneSetMatch is out to change the way donor matches are made. For a person to be an eligible tissue match, he or she needs to have compatible immune system genes. These Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes come in different types, similar to blood types, but more complicated. Just as it is important to only receive blood of a compatible type, transplant patients can only receive tissues from a person with a matching HLA type. Previous studies have shown that these HLA genes and their chromosome 6 neighbors may influence facial characteristics and other visually perceived traits.  GeneSetMatch is developing innovative software that will link facial features with HLA types. Using state of the art machine learning algorithms and high performance computing techniques, we will develop software tools that use facial features to predict HLA types. This will allow a person in need of a bone marrow or organ transplant to search an online source of potential matches that is thousands of times larger than traditional donor lists. By HLA typing more individuals, we can expanding our training and testing sets. This will allow us to create more accurate and precise computational models.  What We Need From the Community
We are setting a initial funding target of $54,000. The majority of funds will be spent on HLA typing participants. Supervised machine learning methods require large training and testing sets, so we will need to HLA type hundreds of individuals. As funding grows over our initial target, it will allow us to continue to refine our methods by HLA typing more people. At this stage, coding and computing time is already funded.
 
Benefits for the Community Although we are not offering any specific incentives for this campaign, we feel the entire project is beneficial to the community since the GeneSetMatch system and accompanying app will be free for users. This will allow those who do not have social media accounts to search for possible donor matches using our powerful software in real time.
 
Our Impact
We will be able to significantly improve the process of organ donor matching by utilizing social media networks and facial recognition software. Regardless of our funding, all of us connected with GeneSetMatch will continue to be working in the area of improving healthcare delivery assisted by bioinformatics and computer science.
 
Many thanks to Brian Switzer for making the project video.

<p>We are needing to raise<b> $25,000.</b> in order to...</p>
<p>$1,200 - Create the initial 3D-printed prototypes. These will be used to create molds for the initial filming units, in other words, the physical Shimmee units to be used for the slick TV and web spots.</p>
<p>$10,000 - For the actual production of initial TV and Web Spots and Infomercials.</p>
<p>$1,000 - Small perks/giveaways, such as Fridge Magnets and Custom ""Scrubbee Shimmee Shower Girls"" Playing Cards.</p>
<p>$5,000 - Perk Fulfilment including shipping.</p>
<p>$5,000 - Office/Shipping space</p>
<p>$2,800 - Taxes, salaries, misc. expenses.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our perks are primarily to be the Product itself, IF we reach our Stretch Goals.</p>
<p>Perks for this early campaign include Custom Playing Cards and Wall Posters (downloadable) with our lovely Shimmee Girls (or Boys, your choice) in sexy, attractive poses using the Shimmee in the shower; Fun Images of YOU in our upcoming 1950's Surf Themed ad images looking just like our Models will in the actual ads (Think the old Frankie and Annette surf movies, with girls and guys ""surfing"" while Shimmee-ing to great old surf riffs!)</p>
<p>And just to be weird, for the lowest donor levels of a mere $5 I am offering to send you one of my TWO great food recipes... my World Famous Spaghetti (Apollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Al Bean LOVES this recipe!), <br/></p>
<p>OR my Amazing, Mouth-Watering Deviled Egg Salad Sandwiches recipe, GREAT for lunches!!!!</p>
<br/><br/><br/>If we do NOT reach our final goal, and funds raised will go to...<br/><br/>Creation of the 3D Prototypes...<br/><br/>Lower-Budget Video Spot production, fewer models.<br/><br/>And<br/><br/>Fulfilling the Poster, Recipe, and Custom Surf Pictures perks.<br/><br/><b>If we reach our STRETCH Goals, the Scrubbee Shimmee will go right into it's initial mass-production run.<br/></b><br/><br/> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p><br/></p>
<p>This invention is of great value in that it will make showering and bathing easier for those with movement troubles, or anyone who wants a more FUN and NATURAL method to get clean.<br/>It is my firm belief that this product will be seen in showers around the world in a few years. It'll be as normal as the soap caddy hanging from the shower head.<br/></p>
<br/><br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div> <p> </p>
<p>The risks in this endeavor are small but present; mostly making sure the sponge attachments have the strength we envision. Currently the design features a rubber-backed sponge attachment that can be replaced, cleaned, switched out for a different sponge or material, etc. This attachment will be affixed to the Shimmee body by simple tabs and will hold based on the rubber acting as a grip on the tabs. If it proves less than perfect, we will add hook-and-loop tabs to the body and the sponges.</p>
<p>Another challenge will be to see how well the Scrubbee Shimmee sells. If it does well, the 3M partnership will move forward, as 3M has certain minimum unit numbers per order. If not, the consumer will be required to purchase Command Strips or other double-sided tapes or caulking adhesives of their choice.</p>
<p>It is likely that either scenario would have only a small effect, if any, on the retail price of the Scrubbee Shimmee.</p>

$10,000 - For the actual production of initial TV and Web Spots and Infomercials.
$1,000 - Small perks/giveaways, such as Fridge Magnets and Custom ""Scrubbee Shimmee Shower Girls"" Playing Cards.
$5,000 - Perk Fulfilment including shipping.
$5,000 - Office/Shipping space
$2,800 - Taxes, salaries, misc. expenses.

Our perks are primarily to be the Product itself, IF we reach our Stretch Goals.
Perks for this early campaign include Custom Playing Cards and Wall Posters (downloadable) with our lovely Shimmee Girls (or Boys, your choice) in sexy, attractive poses using the Shimmee in the shower; Fun Images of YOU in our upcoming 1950's Surf Themed ad images looking just like our Models will in the actual ads (Think the old Frankie and Annette surf movies, with girls and guys ""surfing"" while Shimmee-ing to great old surf riffs!)
And just to be weird, for the lowest donor levels of a mere $5 I am offering to send you one of my TWO great food recipes... my World Famous Spaghetti (Apollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Al Bean LOVES this recipe!), 
OR my Amazing, Mouth-Watering Deviled Egg Salad Sandwiches recipe, GREAT for lunches!!!!
If we do NOT reach our final goal, and funds raised will go to...Creation of the 3D Prototypes...Lower-Budget Video Spot production, fewer models.AndFulfilling the Poster, Recipe, and Custom Surf Pictures perks.If we reach our STRETCH Goals, the Scrubbee Shimmee will go right into it's initial mass-production run.    The Impact 
This invention is of great value in that it will make showering and bathing easier for those with movement troubles, or anyone who wants a more FUN and NATURAL method to get clean.It is my firm belief that this product will be seen in showers around the world in a few years. It'll be as normal as the soap caddy hanging from the shower head.
Risks & Challenges
  
The risks in this endeavor are small but present; mostly making sure the sponge attachments have the strength we envision. Currently the design features a rubber-backed sponge attachment that can be replaced, cleaned, switched out for a different sponge or material, etc. This attachment will be affixed to the Shimmee body by simple tabs and will hold based on the rubber acting as a grip on the tabs. If it proves less than perfect, we will add hook-and-loop tabs to the body and the sponges.
Another challenge will be to see how well the Scrubbee Shimmee sells. If it does well, the 3M partnership will move forward, as 3M has certain minimum unit numbers per order. If not, the consumer will be required to purchase Command Strips or other double-sided tapes or caulking adhesives of their choice.
It is likely that either scenario would have only a small effect, if any, on the retail price of the Scrubbee Shimmee.

Whilst looking for a job I decided to help a friend's aging parents do some work around their home. In the course of cutting fire wood (more specifically, tree branches) with a machete I accidentally hacked into my left hand. Fortunately nothing was severed, but the cut went to the bone and was only stopped by bone.</p>
<p>At the time, because I knew I didn't have insurance I wanted to try and take care of it myself, but my friend's family insisted on taking me to accident and emergency. I received 6 stitches and antibiotics to prevent a potential blood infection. Two weeks later I've received a bill for €565.90 (to which there will be attached ""penalties for each day of delay"" in paying). I'm requesting the money in USD because for some reason I'm unable to link my PayPal account to this campaign, which is required for EUR.</p>
<p>While I know this is not an outrageous medical bill, but it is something I just cannot afford as I have no savings. Even if I found a job tomorrow, the bill would continue to rise while I'm waiting for my first paycheck to come through. If you can help me pay this bill so that it doesn't become some larger debt that I'll be paying off for months to come would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I'm only trying to raise enough to cover the medical bill. I've been told that I'll need some sessions of physiotherapy to regain full use of my left hand, but for now this is something I'll have to do without, or try my best to do by myself. If the goal isn't met, anything raised will still go towards paying the medical bill. If by some good fortune more than the goal could be raised, I'd put that towards the cost of physiotherapy sessions.</p>
</div><div> <p>All I can offer you unfortunately is the satisfaction of helping someone out of a situation that could soon become unmanageable, if it's not dealt with soon. I'd like to be able to offer anyone who would be willing to help me something, but right now it's a struggle to keep a roof over my head while searching for work.</p>

goal that bought them together is  hair
loss, each of them experiencing thinning hair themselves or having family
members and friends who have thinning hair.
This exciting product has been developed by the team at tottalrenew to
bring you a safe instant cosmetic solution for mild to moderate hair loss.  It is 100% effective and works in around 60
seconds.The micro fibres are made from pure plant keratin and are so easy to apply.  Just shake onto the area of thinning hair, gently pat and with a quick spray of ANY firm hold hair spray – it will give you a full head of perfect hair all day. Quite simply, your help will mean that we can make this product
available for everyday people at everyday prices.What We Need & What You Get


We have raised money to research thinning hair
and the effects this can have on everyday life.


We have researched similar products that are on
the market and different costs.


With your help we can begin our production at a
price that is affordable for everyone; giving more people the opportunity to
regain their confidence and have a full head of perfect hair... all day.This is John, before and after tottalrenew.  



tottalrenew  hair fibres give you a fuller thicker head of hair in seconds, blending  seamlessly 
with your own natural hair.
You can support the campaign through a number of different perks ranging from receiving our newsletter, to enjoying the difference our product can make to your life or the life of a loved one to enjoying a fantastic UK Spa Break with a tottalrenew travel pack included.One of the additional challenges at tottalrenew is to create a larger range.  Our micro fibres are currently available in a range of different colours and in the future we would also like to develop the 'highlighter mix kit' which will be smaller bottles of two to three colours for highlighted hair  and the 'discreet bag kit' which will see tottalrenew hair fibres in a beautifully discreet black or brown case.
Another challenge is to make more people aware of our product and to get them to discuss thinning hair and hair loss without embarrassment.We would like to encourage people to offer solutions to each other, like tottalrenew and to get people to support our product, not just through Perks but also through a social media rumble so that we, at tottalrenew, can offer this product to more people at a more competitive price each and every time.FAQ'sWho are we?

<h3>The Next Step: Scaling Up<br/>
</h3>While we ultimately want to be able to provide water to 10s to 100s of millions of people, we must first do development work to create a practical product and to demonstrate that it works in the hands of users in faraway countries.  Right now all the filter papers are made by hand by Teri or a student in a local church kitchen.   The next step in the project is scaling up production and field testing 
to distribute filter papers to 100s to 1000s of people.   <br/><br/>The biggest limitation to the project at this time is funding.  Paper manufacturing costs money.  Travel to far away countries costs money.  In-country personnel require salaries.  Most of all, since Teri completed her work at UVa, the project has entirely been funded by crowdsourcing, and all our work on the project has been done on a volunteer unpaid basis.  <br/><br/>Ideally we would like to perform a field trial of the papers for 1-2 months in about a dozen villages.  We will work with other nonprofits with local expertise and in-country staff to evaluate the papers' performance.   We will evaluate source water quality, the quality of the filtered water, and the effects on human health. <br/><br/><h3>Project Funding Goals</h3>$30k, two villages, one month: for $30k we can get the equipment, paper production, travel funding, and personnel time to test the papers in two villages for about a month.  <br/><br/>Additional money would allow us to test papers in more villages and for longer amounts of time.  <br/><br/>$150k, about a dozen villages, 1-2 months each village: our ultimate goal is to test the papers in a variety of locations to demonstrate that they work with a variety of waters and in a variety of communities. </div><div><br/></div><h3></h3><h4>Donation Levels</h4><div>$10 is about how much it costs to manufacture one book by hand.  We're aiming for a price of &lt;10 cents per filter paper after scale up, so ~100 papers.  We expect pilot scale production costs will be higher.  </div><div>$20=2 books, ~200 papers<br/>$50=5 books, ~500 papers</div><div>$100=lab supplies</div><div>$1000=a bacteria incubator and related supplies, a substantial portion of the salary for in-country personnel, travel to the project country<br/>
</div><div>The largest costs for this project are the time and equipment for planning and executing the pilot scale paper production, the human health assessment, the water quality assessment, and travel to- and operations in- a country on the other side of the world.  That is, the majority of costs at this time are not the physical paper itself or the paper treatment, but rather the necessary work that must be done to assess that the papers are effective.  We do not sell the papers at this time because without such a proper assessment we would not find this ethical.  </div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Someday we would like to have these papers in the hands of the poorest people throughout the world.  But before we can get to 1 million we have to go through 1,000.  We will be applying for governmental research grants but the turnaround time will leave us unable to move the project forward for half a year to a year.  If we can raise money through crowdsourcing the project will be able to continue moving forward: the first pilot scale production run will be made and field trials to evaluate the effect of the papers will be performed.   <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Scaling up from bench scale production and small field trials to a pilot plant and a dozen villages will require overcoming a variety of unforeseen challenges.  Working in countries on the other side of the world creates a variety of challenges.  Over the past several years we have developed partnerships with a diverse array of very talented people and organizations. Each is highly qualified in its own area, whether paper manufacturing or community health field projects.   We also maintain the flexibility to engage additional experts with abilities outside our own area.</p>

<p>Leegle is the world’s first app that can detect brainwashing, manipulation and thought control in any text - either written or spoken. It uses the benefits of our three special technologies called <b>BULL¹</b>, <b>TaSA²</b> and <b>EMO³</b>.</p>
<p>To put it simple: Leegle embraces the knowledge base of linguistics, psychology, semiotics, anthropology, memetics, math and history to filter out word patterns that can subliminally affect a human.</p>
<p>Most of the information that comes out of our environment and media is designed to influence our behavior. You can observe that at work, school and home: literally all people communicate by certain codes of mutual manipulation, including parents and children. That is happening because we are taught to do so by a sequential heritage vectoring from our ancestors to descendants.</p>
<p>But whatever is accepted between people who know each other will unlikely work well for you and a stranger. Especially on the street, during negotiations and, of course, on TV and Internet.</p>

<p><span>Indiegogo, as many other info hubs like Airbnb, TEDx or IFL Science, is a place where quite particular people congregate. Advanced open minded learners and idea pushers, like you and me, know very well that human society is massively driven by greed, fear and lust, making the money a universal unit of human interactions. No evil or good has ever been publicly released without the goal of earning cash, so any news, ads, talk and TV shows, as well as political debates and charity are designed specially to generate income. Guess who is the source of that business :) Yes, it’s you and me, the ones who watch, read and listen to the messages, which include special word combinations that influence the way we think. We might suddenly want to believe, purchase or support. Leegle is being created to detect such scams and raise a red flag for you.</span></p>
<p><span><b><i>“A hypnosis-type mental pressure has been noted by the Supreme Court of the United States to be so unduly influential that it deprives someone of their fundamental rights.”</i></b></span></p>In order not to get caught into these sticky nets one must either simply not participate by turning everything off, or learn through dozens of books on linguistics, psychology, history, neurophysiology, genetics and math. That looks kinda hard, and indeed is, you can trust people who’ve done it during the last 12 years. That’s why we’ve delegated this task of learning to our software so you don’t have to.</div><div>
<p><span>Use it on your smartphone, computer, tablet and wearables like smart watch or glasses to monitor the incoming information flow and guard you from subliminal influence.</span></p>

<p><span>We are well aware that most of the people do not consider this to be a significant threat, because it’s their daily routine like breathing air that no one notices. This is exactly why we pledge our idea here at Indiegogo, the community of thinkers and opinion leaders. Think of any significant breakthrough like radio or morphine. The first one was considered to be economically unbeneficial, because there was no wire to control payments. The second one had been believed to be a panacea and a nice toy. Both mistakes seem vivid now but doesn’t the history repeat?</span></p>
<p>It’s a big piece of text you’ve gone through so far and we deeply appreciate that! Since you are really interested, please do read our stories about how we came to this point and why we are doing this project. See what we believe and share, and maybe you will find that appealing enough to join our striving for evolution, freedom and progress.</p>

<h3>Leegle in action</h3>
<div>
<p>Leegle app is designed to detect special neural linguistic structures in texts. These structures can bypass a person’s conscious filters and program people to think and act in a desired way. Leegle analyzes spoken speech and written text, defining the degree and direction of the influence on subconscious process that serve manipulative suggestion. Depending on the software version the result is: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>A 5 level scale indicator</b> (safe, fair, suspicious, harmful and dangerous);</p></li>
<li><p><b>Highlighted passages and explanation of the manipulation techniques used;</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>An indication of the real purpose and meaning of the text between the lines</b> (ex: make you feel guilty and pay; make you feel scared and vote; make you feel hopeful and invest, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Leegle can analyse texts from any other apps installed on your device. Simply select any passage and transfer it to the app by share button or via clipboard. Leegle will send the data to the processing server and show the results in its app as graphic charts and explanations. In the mode of permanent environment scanning the app analyzes all the incoming speech and alerts users when the chosen presets get activated.</p>
<p>The following types of psychological manipulation techniques can be detected by Leegle: Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), hypnosis, covert influence, subliminal advertising, trance induction, brainwashing, reeducation, indoctrination, coercive persuasion, conversational hypnosis, zombification, thought control, thought reform, neuromarketing, verbal magic, “bewitching”, psycho-religion, mental viruses, cyber bullying, transformational linguistics.</p>

<p><span>By backing Leegle you support the technology of fighting the unique evil, which has been spread so widely and for so long time that people don’t even notice it, like the air we breathe. This evil is meanly using our natural biologically conditioned reactions for reaching its illegal goals. Our future will look much brighter if people stop using hidden subliminal influence against each other. A detector that defines such manipulations can guarantee a kind and honorable intentions between people in a dialogue.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear crowdfunders! Considering the virtual specifics of our project we are glad to offer you physical rewards, made in style of classic Ukrainian ornamented clothes called ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyshyvanka"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vyshyvanka</a>"" (embroidery) inspired by Leegle. </span></p>
<p>Just like the subject of our research - human verbal communications - each type of vyshyvanka carries a code. An experienced craftsman knows how to read that code, expressed in colours, type of embroidery and patterns.</p>To Ukrainians vyshyvanka is not only a cultural heritage, but also a symbol of independence, democracy and freedom. Especially nowadays. Your contribution into popularisation of Ukrainian culture will surely be rewarded by our open and hospitable people. We highly value and appreciate our friends and partners who respect our right for independence and freedom.  <p> </p>

</div></div>","About this project
Leegle is the world’s first app that can detect brainwashing, manipulation and thought control in any text - either written or spoken. It uses the benefits of our three special technologies called BULL¹, TaSA² and EMO³.
To put it simple: Leegle embraces the knowledge base of linguistics, psychology, semiotics, anthropology, memetics, math and history to filter out word patterns that can subliminally affect a human.
Most of the information that comes out of our environment and media is designed to influence our behavior. You can observe that at work, school and home: literally all people communicate by certain codes of mutual manipulation, including parents and children. That is happening because we are taught to do so by a sequential heritage vectoring from our ancestors to descendants.
But whatever is accepted between people who know each other will unlikely work well for you and a stranger. Especially on the street, during negotiations and, of course, on TV and Internet.

Indiegogo, as many other info hubs like Airbnb, TEDx or IFL Science, is a place where quite particular people congregate. Advanced open minded learners and idea pushers, like you and me, know very well that human society is massively driven by greed, fear and lust, making the money a universal unit of human interactions. No evil or good has ever been publicly released without the goal of earning cash, so any news, ads, talk and TV shows, as well as political debates and charity are designed specially to generate income. Guess who is the source of that business :) Yes, it’s you and me, the ones who watch, read and listen to the messages, which include special word combinations that influence the way we think. We might suddenly want to believe, purchase or support. Leegle is being created to detect such scams and raise a red flag for you.
“A hypnosis-type mental pressure has been noted by the Supreme Court of the United States to be so unduly influential that it deprives someone of their fundamental rights.”In order not to get caught into these sticky nets one must either simply not participate by turning everything off, or learn through dozens of books on linguistics, psychology, history, neurophysiology, genetics and math. That looks kinda hard, and indeed is, you can trust people who’ve done it during the last 12 years. That’s why we’ve delegated this task of learning to our software so you don’t have to.
Use it on your smartphone, computer, tablet and wearables like smart watch or glasses to monitor the incoming information flow and guard you from subliminal influence.

We are well aware that most of the people do not consider this to be a significant threat, because it’s their daily routine like breathing air that no one notices. This is exactly why we pledge our idea here at Indiegogo, the community of thinkers and opinion leaders. Think of any significant breakthrough like radio or morphine. The first one was considered to be economically unbeneficial, because there was no wire to control payments. The second one had been believed to be a panacea and a nice toy. Both mistakes seem vivid now but doesn’t the history repeat?
It’s a big piece of text you’ve gone through so far and we deeply appreciate that! Since you are really interested, please do read our stories about how we came to this point and why we are doing this project. See what we believe and share, and maybe you will find that appealing enough to join our striving for evolution, freedom and progress.


Leegle in action

Leegle app is designed to detect special neural linguistic structures in texts. These structures can bypass a person’s conscious filters and program people to think and act in a desired way. Leegle analyzes spoken speech and written text, defining the degree and direction of the influence on subconscious process that serve manipulative suggestion. Depending on the software version the result is: 

A 5 level scale indicator (safe, fair, suspicious, harmful and dangerous);
Highlighted passages and explanation of the manipulation techniques used;
An indication of the real purpose and meaning of the text between the lines (ex: make you feel guilty and pay; make you feel scared and vote; make you feel hopeful and invest, etc.)

Leegle can analyse texts from any other apps installed on your device. Simply select any passage and transfer it to the app by share button or via clipboard. Leegle will send the data to the processing server and show the results in its app as graphic charts and explanations. In the mode of permanent environment scanning the app analyzes all the incoming speech and alerts users when the chosen presets get activated.
The following types of psychological manipulation techniques can be detected by Leegle: Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), hypnosis, covert influence, subliminal advertising, trance induction, brainwashing, reeducation, indoctrination, coercive persuasion, conversational hypnosis, zombification, thought control, thought reform, neuromarketing, verbal magic, “bewitching”, psycho-religion, mental viruses, cyber bullying, transformational linguistics.


How to use
 
 
 


Select a text for analysis and transfer your selection to our app by clicking Share button or via clipboard

See your results in an automatically opened Leegle app:

 


An overall mark of brainwashing level; 
Highlighting suspicious elements (heat map); 

Explanations and tips (the depth of details depends on your subscription plan).


 

Back Leegle App!
 

By backing Leegle you support the technology of fighting the unique evil, which has been spread so widely and for so long time that people don’t even notice it, like the air we breathe. This evil is meanly using our natural biologically conditioned reactions for reaching its illegal goals. Our future will look much brighter if people stop using hidden subliminal influence against each other. A detector that defines such manipulations can guarantee a kind and honorable intentions between people in a dialogue.


 


What do I pay for?
The backing fund resources will be allocated to:

Fully develop the software for all popular OS platforms;
Rent cloud storage and pay for the speech recognition/translation APIs to Google;
Add more popular languages to make Leegle available in many countries;
Set up the user support service.


Giving out our basic app for absolutely free we will have to cover the aforementioned expenses by offering prepaid packages with larger unit sets and deeper analytical features.
The simplest package will allow analyzing text passages of up to 1 000 words (about 2,5 pages of A4 format). The advanced users will have access to much more serious program features.

The Safe and Simple Way to Play Away...
Each Prossa App Pack  comes with an easy to clean, cordless, rechargeable Playmate unit complete with a USB charger. It is compatible with both iphone and android mobile technology. Simply download the App to your mobile handset, charge up your Playmate, and start to play. 
                                      



Stay Connected, Stay Hitched, Stay Intimate...
Don't let physical estrangement come between you and your lover. The new Prossa App Pack is the fun way to keep intimate from a distance. As long as you can access the internet on your mobile phone, you can now personally pleasure your playmate either at home or anywhere in the world.  
From the Bottom of Our Hearts to the Heart of Your Bottom...
We
are a small start-up, not a huge multinational company, so we care about what
we do. We take your fun seriously. The Prossa Playmate has been
ergonomically designed in order to fit any snug bottom comfortably. It has been
fashioned from medical grade silicone which is completely safe, easy to clean
and 100% waterproof. The unique twin motor system not only enables a range of
variable vibrating and massage options, but also a stroking function that is
guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. The Prossa Application Pack gives
you and your partner the freedom to stimulate your secluded P-Spot from
anywhere in the world. 
 You are in control...In addition to the 6 pre-programmed patterns, which can be operated without the App, your Prossa Playmate can be controlled remotely by any smartphone giving complete control of the intensity of your 'P-Spot' orgasm to whoever you choose. 

This is Cyber Sex Without the Scary Science Fiction...

The
Prossa Playmate has been designed to be as discreet as possible. It
vibrates in a super smooth fashion which ensures that the earth will move for
you and not your next door neighbour. Furthermore, a gyroscope sensor has been
embedded and sealed inside the pack which is able to track and record the pulse
of your orgasm. You have the option to save this data and personalize your own
favourite stimulating routines. 
We
are keen to engage in a dialogue with all our customers and backers in order to
create a sex toy that continues to improve and give satisfaction.

<p>I'm a passionate diver since 2009! Since then, I've intensively taken care of all different aspects of this fascinating sport! That is how my project 'Dive in the Blue' came to life. Because only a diver knows what divers want and need!</p>
<ul>
<li>Best quality with highest safety standards;</li>
<li>distinctive designs: an own sign of recognition;</li>
<li>good prices</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a fact that in most teamsports suppliers send their products directly to the customers in order to guarantee fair prices. Especially divers, who need a lot of equipment anyway, earn such an opportunity, too. That is what we want to create: a new brand label of fashion and equipment that is delivered directly to the divers' home. That's how we can offer best quality for extraordinary prices!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457085526/qwsfo6zdguxwttjkeouw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Speaking of distinctive designs: The 'Dive in the Blue' brand logo already convinced manufacturers as well as potential clients. Does it just show a normal fish shape? It doesn't! Take a second look and find the outline of another fish crossing by from the right.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455282264/oxokqdoxq8qcwcx9x8pz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This element is the main design of the first collection of our functional and trendy dive fashion. No matter what: Our t-shirts, polos, hoodies and caps offer an own sign of recognition for every diver. Extraordinary easy and simply clever!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455289565/qjale0zc6g1kjyb66iqy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Mass production? Not with 'Dive in the Blue'! The client himself can choose out of different features like shirt and design colors. In addition to that, he can customize it with his name or other individual text elements. Our high-quality fashion products are refined by hand in our own fablab (fabrics laboratory)!</p>

<p>Our online shop is still under construction, but it will be launched in spring 2016! Here's a first insight! You want to support us more? Then we have unique perks for you!</p>

<p>We were able to implement our first fashion line by our own credit. We've initiated good contacts with experienced manufacturers! That is why we are motivated to let the next step follow at once. We'd like to produce and sell our own equipment for diving and water sports!</p>
<p>But therefore, I need your support: In order to realize our philosophy of highest quality with best-price-policy, I have to order a special amount of items per stock. That is why I need a calculable funding!</p>
<p>With the revenue of this campaign, I would like to add the following diving goods to our assortment:</p>
<ul>
<li>wetsuit (3mm)</li>
<li>diving mask</li>
<li>snorkel</li>
<li>diving flashlight</li>
</ul>
<p>For this, I need approximately USD 8.000 (EUR 7.500,--)! The rest is going to be invested into exclusive perks as well as into fees and taxes.</p>
<p>The money funded by the crowd will be used for water sports equipment anyway – no matter what amount it finally will be. If there is less money available, I'll reduce the assortment! Do we achieve even more, I'll add some more products:</p>
<ul>
<li>diving mask for kids</li>
<li>shorty (adults and children)</li>
<li>more items</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457086562/jgkzxdantue6dvxeeh9g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I'm staunchly confident of our project! Even more than that, I look forward expectantly: How will the divers assimilate our products?</p>
<p>We're pitching high, but our equipment for water sports will convince you! Why am I so sure about that? I've tried every single item of our assortment myself and have supervised all improvements during the manufacturing process. I've controlled the usability, the quality and the safety of every product. This was the procedure and it will go on in the future – as long as I am 'addicted to water'! That's my promise!</p>

<p>2009 hat mich das Tauchfieber gepackt! Seitdem habe ich mich intensiv mit den verschiedenen Facetten dieser faszinierenden Sportart beschäftigt. Hieraus ist das Projekt 'Dive in the Blue' entstanden. Denn: Nur ein Taucher weiß, was Taucher wollen und brauchen!</p>

I'm a passionate diver since 2009! Since then, I've intensively taken care of all different aspects of this fascinating sport! That is how my project 'Dive in the Blue' came to life. Because only a diver knows what divers want and need!

Best quality with highest safety standards;
distinctive designs: an own sign of recognition;
good prices

It is a fact that in most teamsports suppliers send their products directly to the customers in order to guarantee fair prices. Especially divers, who need a lot of equipment anyway, earn such an opportunity, too. That is what we want to create: a new brand label of fashion and equipment that is delivered directly to the divers' home. That's how we can offer best quality for extraordinary prices!

Speaking of distinctive designs: The 'Dive in the Blue' brand logo already convinced manufacturers as well as potential clients. Does it just show a normal fish shape? It doesn't! Take a second look and find the outline of another fish crossing by from the right.

This element is the main design of the first collection of our functional and trendy dive fashion. No matter what: Our t-shirts, polos, hoodies and caps offer an own sign of recognition for every diver. Extraordinary easy and simply clever!

Mass production? Not with 'Dive in the Blue'! The client himself can choose out of different features like shirt and design colors. In addition to that, he can customize it with his name or other individual text elements. Our high-quality fashion products are refined by hand in our own fablab (fabrics laboratory)!

Our online shop is still under construction, but it will be launched in spring 2016! Here's a first insight! You want to support us more? Then we have unique perks for you!

We were able to implement our first fashion line by our own credit. We've initiated good contacts with experienced manufacturers! That is why we are motivated to let the next step follow at once. We'd like to produce and sell our own equipment for diving and water sports!
But therefore, I need your support: In order to realize our philosophy of highest quality with best-price-policy, I have to order a special amount of items per stock. That is why I need a calculable funding!
With the revenue of this campaign, I would like to add the following diving goods to our assortment:

wetsuit (3mm)
diving mask
snorkel
diving flashlight

For this, I need approximately USD 8.000 (EUR 7.500,--)! The rest is going to be invested into exclusive perks as well as into fees and taxes.
The money funded by the crowd will be used for water sports equipment anyway – no matter what amount it finally will be. If there is less money available, I'll reduce the assortment! Do we achieve even more, I'll add some more products:

diving mask for kids
shorty (adults and children)
more items


I'm staunchly confident of our project! Even more than that, I look forward expectantly: How will the divers assimilate our products?
We're pitching high, but our equipment for water sports will convince you! Why am I so sure about that? I've tried every single item of our assortment myself and have supervised all improvements during the manufacturing process. I've controlled the usability, the quality and the safety of every product. This was the procedure and it will go on in the future – as long as I am 'addicted to water'! That's my promise!

You can be the first to get a unique 'Dive in the Blue' fashion product! This privilege is worth to get involved!
Your support opens a new opportunity for every participant in diving or any other water sports in order to buy their equipment or fashion products!
A big 'thank you' to all who are supporting us! Here are our valuable peaks:

Get our distinctive designs for diving and water sports on hoodies, polos, T-shirts or caps! This is an 'early bird' offer – our online shop has not yet opened!
Lifelong or on a time range: Get attractive 10% discounts for every order in our shop!
Get one of our exclusive fan articles: high-quality softshell jackets, trendy gymsacs or keybands – these products will definitely not be sold anywhere!
Be the first to get an unforgettable holiday experience at Turtles Beach Resort between Hurghada and El Gouna in Egypt (up from 2018).


All supporters will be named at our 'Wall of Fame' on the 'Dive in the Blue' website (as wished only).

At first, many thanks that you've read about us and our campaign up to this point! We're happy about your interest – no matter if you're planning to support our fundraising or not.
There are some more possibilities to help us getting well known:

Talk about 'Dive in the Blue' and our projects – surely there are divers or other participants in water sports in your family or among friends who will be happy to get informed about us!
Show them our crowdfunding campaign on indiegogo.com!

IndieGoGo campaign created by Department 4
Disclaimer:
While the Skrill Garden IndieGoGo campaign is very real, the “skrill” included with the Skrill Garden is not real currency of any kind. Additionally, we make no claims to any actual health or financial benefits with the Skrill Garden product. None of the “gold” mentioned in any of the Skrill Garden products, such as the gold-plated rake in the Deluxe Set, is actual gold. But we do however hope that it brings you much joy and relaxation.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>In November 2014, I founded People Against Violence Org., where we offer 24-hour phone and private counseling (by qualified counselors), free self-defence classes, and access to alternative accommodations. </p>
<p>I designed this very important app called, uAlert in the summer of 2014 to actually send emergency assistance to victims of domestic or street violence. But my app got a little more sophisticated with several added features and internal reporting and statistics. </p>
<h3>About This Project</h3> <p></p>
<p>I wanted to create an app that brought a real sense of security to both the user and the concerned family member or friend. There are various personal safety apps out in the market, but none like this one. When I first started designing uAlert back in the summer of 2014, I didn't even know that any had existed. Still, after having reviewed a few competing apps recently, I came to the conclusion that my original app still beats what is available today in the market. And here's why...</p>
<p>uAlert is a true emergency response system that uses your phone's gps to locate you and, when you raise an alert, sends help your way. It is a ""system"" because there are teams of people actually involved; it isn't a mere self-functioning app. It has been designed to offer the fastest and most efficient response in the event of an attack.</p>
<p>When the ""Hi' alert button is pressed, not only is the police number in your designated country set up to dial out, but a video recording begins automatically and a short video is submitted to our centre. You have the option to send more video if you are able to. We have a team of personnel standing by for assistance and can communicate directly with the user/victim. What's more, we have the largest security company in the world able to offer scheduled security services exclusively through our app. (The only feature where there's an additional cost.)</p>
<p>Additional and crucial features include User Check-In, Missing Child Poster, My Diary, smart watch compatibility (where you can alert us even more quickly) and much more.</p>
<p>We are currently tweaking the app which, is set to be released end of October 2015. Did we mention that this app can be used worldwide?</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The funding required is mostly paying for the high development costs of this very sophisticated app. We also require paid staff to monitor the alerts and communicate directly with the victims. We are, however, keeping all costs to a minimum, as we foresee that some expenses will also go into marketing our product.</p>
<p>We are still tweaking the app and would love to add a phase 2 with additional features but it will all depend on the success of this campaign.</p>
<p>As for perks, we can offer free self-defence classes and phone counselling with qualified counsellors, complements of People Against Violence Org. We can also add your business pin in our app! Please refer to the perks section.</p>
<p>Even if we do not reach our fundraising goal, we are already well into this and will roll with what we got.

In November 2014, I founded People Against Violence Org., where we offer 24-hour phone and private counseling (by qualified counselors), free self-defence classes, and access to alternative accommodations. 
I designed this very important app called, uAlert in the summer of 2014 to actually send emergency assistance to victims of domestic or street violence. But my app got a little more sophisticated with several added features and internal reporting and statistics. 
About This Project 
I wanted to create an app that brought a real sense of security to both the user and the concerned family member or friend. There are various personal safety apps out in the market, but none like this one. When I first started designing uAlert back in the summer of 2014, I didn't even know that any had existed. Still, after having reviewed a few competing apps recently, I came to the conclusion that my original app still beats what is available today in the market. And here's why...
uAlert is a true emergency response system that uses your phone's gps to locate you and, when you raise an alert, sends help your way. It is a ""system"" because there are teams of people actually involved; it isn't a mere self-functioning app. It has been designed to offer the fastest and most efficient response in the event of an attack.
When the ""Hi' alert button is pressed, not only is the police number in your designated country set up to dial out, but a video recording begins automatically and a short video is submitted to our centre. You have the option to send more video if you are able to. We have a team of personnel standing by for assistance and can communicate directly with the user/victim. What's more, we have the largest security company in the world able to offer scheduled security services exclusively through our app. (The only feature where there's an additional cost.)
Additional and crucial features include User Check-In, Missing Child Poster, My Diary, smart watch compatibility (where you can alert us even more quickly) and much more.
We are currently tweaking the app which, is set to be released end of October 2015. Did we mention that this app can be used worldwide?
   What We Need & What You Get The funding required is mostly paying for the high development costs of this very sophisticated app. We also require paid staff to monitor the alerts and communicate directly with the victims. We are, however, keeping all costs to a minimum, as we foresee that some expenses will also go into marketing our product.
We are still tweaking the app and would love to add a phase 2 with additional features but it will all depend on the success of this campaign.
As for perks, we can offer free self-defence classes and phone counselling with qualified counsellors, complements of People Against Violence Org. We can also add your business pin in our app! Please refer to the perks section.
Even if we do not reach our fundraising goal, we are already well into this and will roll with what we got. It is, after all, for a good cause and could save lives.   The Impact The impact this app will have in the world in general is limitless. We believe that we could help save thousands of women, men, children and even animals from domestic abuse or street violence. But we're aiming to save much more. 
Our app tracks each case, giving us, as well as all countries, important and detailed information and statistics.
    Risks & Challenges  I had tried putting together teams of volunteer emergency staff, aka, ""The Help Squad"", which was a challenge because these qualified crisis intervention officers needed to get paid.  Since I will be able to do this with additional funding, I keep this as an added bonus. The app still communicates with live people and will send for help when the alert is pressed because emergency contacts, my centre (staff) and the local police will still be notified.

Those extra few seconds could make the difference between a near miss, a little bump, or something tragic.Today, only some top specification cars and motorbikes have EBLD technology built-in by the manufacturers!so we made 'GSTOP®' ..but it had to be better in order to compete, so our team went to town, and made GSTOP® truly innovative.Team Photo (Shenzhen)THE GSTOP® TEAM

<p><strong>What are we fundraising for? / Warum Fundraising für eine Arzneimittelentwicklung? - English text below<br/></strong></p>
<p>Als kleine Ausgründung aus der Freien Universität Berlin haben wir gemeinsam mit Prof. Christoph Stein von der Charité Berlin und Prof. Haag von der FU Berlin eine bahnbrechende Entdecklung gemacht: <b>Nanoverkapselte Opiate, ohne zentrale Nebenwirkungen. </b>Damit ist es möglich, dass sich Schmerzpatienten ohne Gefahr von Sucht, von Sedierung und ohne Nebenwirkungen von den Vorteilen von Opiaten profitieren könnten. <br/></p>
<p>Wir verwenden hierbei ein Opiat, welches von Big Pharma aus der Forschung aussortiert wurde. Dieses Arzneimittel wollen wir möglichst schnell für Menschen und Tiere verfügbar machen. Insbesondere Katzen vertragen viele Schmerzmittel nur schlecht oder gar nicht. <br/></p>

<h2>
<b>Our fundraising goal -  a better quality of life with chronic pain:</b><br/>
</h2>
<p>Millions of people suffer from chronic pain. Back pain. Cancer pain. Chronic visceral pain. And as you may know the most efficient pain killers are opioids, like morphine or <em>oxycodone</em> for excample. <br/></p>
<p>The  use  of opioids for acute pain or terminal pain is well accepted. Their role 
in the long-term treatment of chronic noncancer pain is, however, 
highly controversial for many reasons. One of the primary reasons is the 
well-known phenomenon of psychological addiction that can occur with the
 use of these medications. <br/></p>
<p>For those who can and will obtain them, opioids come with risks and severe side effects like respiratory depression and severe constipation, nausea and drowsiness.</p>Just imagine: an opioid, which does neither cause addiction, nor sedation or drowsiness and no constipation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>A drug that combats your pain, but does not compromize your mind and thinking. A drug that enables you to stay active, keep your job and your quality of life.<br/>
</h3>
<h3>A drug that shall be available at low cost for everybody.<br/><br/>
</h3>
<p>Prof. Christoph Stein, MD, from the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, previously  Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Baltimore, USA has discovered a mechanism
 of action that will make all this true. <br/></p>
<p>First experiments have shown 
that the feat can be accomplished.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Prof. Stein was one of the first scientists to realize that pain 
does not need to be controlled in the brain - it can be controlled at 
the site of damage instead.</h3>
<br/><p><b>How does it work: </b><br/></p>
<p>Very simply:  <br/></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Most pain like tumor pain, post-operative pain, visceral pain is associated with inflammation. This causes changes in the metabolism of this tissue.<br/></p>
<p><b>Step2:</b> Pain receptors (opioid receptors) are multiplied in this case at the inflammed site - outside the brain. The diseased tissue also becomes more acidic than healthy tissue.<br/></p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b> We combine an excisting opiod with a nanocarrier. <br/></p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b> The resulting drug molecule is now so large that it cannot pass through the blood brain barrier. It can only penetrate damaged and inflammed tissue.<br/></p>
<p><b>Step 5</b>: The drug is released only at the painfull, inflammed region of the body. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<b>Who are we?<br/></b>
<p></p>
<h3>The campaign is led by the DendroPharm team. Together with Prof. 
Dr. Haag of the Free University of Berlin we have developed a cutting edge 
nanocarrier technology and developed the a novel method for nanocarrier
 synthesis. </h3>

With the income of this project we can pay for the clinical trials. <b>So in any case - we can make it happen - with your help.  </b><br/></p>We will also stay independent enough from Big Pharma to make sure that the price for this medication will stay affordable for all. <br/>

There are many eaters like me that enjoy engaging with other cultures through food, so it's really not a question of how many Filipinos there are to <i>eat</i> the food... so, what gives?</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I'm Ellie and I'm one half of the dynamic Filipino-American sibling duo that's dreamed up and executed pop-ups of all forms, shapes and sizes in Boston this past year. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The answer is complex, but I think one of the puzzle pieces into which Kulinarya and the <a href=""pamangan.splashthat.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pamangan pop up</a> fit is answering the call to create. If the <a href=""pamangan.splashthat.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pop-ups</a> we've run are any indication of the hunger Boston has for Filipino food and our take on our Kapampangan heritage, we're also getting at another piece: </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The desire to have the Filipino-inspired food that Pamangan is serving is clear. Dare we say... ardent.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Filipino food in Boston. Why not, indeed!</span></p>
<div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h3>But This Isn't Just About Filipino Food</h3>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">While we are filling this void of Filipino food in Boston, what’s even more important to us is that we do this work in a way that takes care of everyone involved — that’s diners and all the people that work hard to put that food in front of you. From the beginning, we want our voice to carry a message that says food is more than a transaction. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our restaurant will be an echo chamber for all the important work people are already doing to change the way that people think about food consumption. People are behind every part of that process and our mission is to be intentional about recognizing that in a practical way. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">For us, that means sourcing from farms and other producers who have a sense of purpose beyond profit and who treat their folks well. That means starting with a living wage for the people that work with us and working to provide them benefits and ways of plugging into the business. That means thinking about you, and how our food nourishes your health, but also your soul (that beind said, there's always time and place for lechon).</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">So Where Does My Money Go?</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>Funding a restaurant is an expensive and risky endeavor. That's not lost on us and it's why we believe your contribution is an essential part of giving the restaurant the best shot it has. We have a concept (tapas bar!) and a realistic idea of how much money we'll need (a lot!) -- so your piece comes into making sure the space we decide to make our home is in the right place and is on favorable terms. </p>
<p>Many bootstrapped restaurant businesses not only cut corners but rush into decisions without enough consideration, and we want to avoid that. $20,000 of your contribution will go towards legal, financial and marketing counsel as we make our first move: securing a space.</p>
<p>The rest will go towards supplementing the funds we pay into the pop-up to develop the menu, find a place in town that'll let us be a regular fixture and explore questions like ""What does it take for us to pay all our staff a living wage and still survive the restaurant grind?"" ""How can we involve the people who grow and raise our food in our business?"" and ""What can we do to continue to rethink the hierarchy of the kitchen and the floor?""</p>
<p>So, are you wondering why there isn't Filipino food in Boston? Are you wondering why Filipino food hasn't had the same presence that other food cultures have? Do you live in Boston and want to be part of bringing a culture that needs representation to the place you call home? Do you live elsewhere and care about the representation of the Filipino diaspora? DONATE!</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We've got 30 days to make it happen! If we meet our goal, let's party! Pamangan will throw a holiday party for all our contributors in Boston!</span><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>About the Project Thus Far</h3> <p></p>
<p>While we both had a lot of personal and professional experience, we started this project flying by the seats of our pants. We really had no expectation for this beyond being able to do something together that we’ve always done, put ourselves wholly into the task of creating and cooking and serving food, something that has always been an expression of love in our family. The intensity of support and excitement for more of what we were doing was inspiring and without hesitation, both me and my brother felt we had to do it again.</p>
<p>Since August of 2014, we’ve hosted this dinner in many places, turning everything from gallery spaces to cafes into restaurants for a night. My brother often takes a red-eye flight on a Friday night to be here for a weekend of insanity and we’ve made lots of connections to folks and facilitated connections between folks who are completely supportive of bringing Filipino food to Boston. Since that first pop up, our idea of what we want has become more and more concrete and it’s clear to both of us that we want to give Filipino food a permanent home in Boston. What that means is a restaurant and that’s why we’re asking for your help.</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve explored many different paths… it’s almost cliche that I return to the place I began, making Filipino food. One of my first memories is of being at the stove with my dad, on a step stool, stirring a sauce while he showed me what to watch for as it thickened. With my dad being a chef, and with our house being the house that all family and friend gatherings happened, and with so many positive memories around the preparation of food, making food is a way for me to bring the social and sharing culture of it that I’ve known all my life.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Does My Contribution Absolutely, Positively Guarantee This Restaurant Is Happening?</h3> <p> The short and disappointing answer is ""no."" What's important to say is that there are lots of pieces that are crucial to opening any restaurant's doors and unforeseeable things can happen that stall or halt the process. That being said, we're repositioning our lives to give this project everything it needs to become a brick and mortar. </p>
<p>RJ is going to be one of the major investors in the business and I will be 100% focused on the task of bringing the restaurant to life, and running it once we've welcomed you in.</p>
<p>Your contribution is an essential piece to giving this restaurant the best chance possible here in Boston and acts two-fold: it shows investors that there is undeniable support and demand for a Filipino restaurant in Boston and it provides us with the capital necessary to secure a space and to develop best practices that will inform the restaurant.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Money Is Hard to Come By, But I Still Want to Support!</span></p>
</div><div> <p>Tell your friends and urge them to donate. That is one of the most helpful things you can do! If there's one specific thing we'd like to ask all of you to do is record a 15-second video to put on Instagram or Facebook about why you think Pamangan should be a restaurant! Tag it with #PamanganPopUp and #RestaurantorBust2016 and we'll feature it and shower you with many, many thanks!</p>
<p>I also know you have mad skills. The business of making a restaurant go is much, much more than chopping onions with lightning speed and zero tearing (but if that's one of your many talents, then I wanna hear about it!). Email me at ellie@kulinarya.us and let's sit down for coffee.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>I Got Other Questions</h3>
<p>Q: It's that gift-giving time of year. What if I want to send a perk to someone else?</p>
<p>A: Easy-peasy! Just use their name and address in the shipping information. If you find there's any problem at all with this, email Ellie at ellie@kulinarya.us!</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Q: What if I want to just pick up my perk from you?</span><br/></p>
<p></p>

</div></div>","Why Isn't There Filipino Food in Boston? Boston is a world-class city and it's surprising that a cuisine as complex and ripe for interesting exploration as Filipino food is not on the restaurant roster. There are many eaters like me that enjoy engaging with other cultures through food, so it's really not a question of how many Filipinos there are to eat the food... so, what gives?
I'm Ellie and I'm one half of the dynamic Filipino-American sibling duo that's dreamed up and executed pop-ups of all forms, shapes and sizes in Boston this past year. The answer is complex, but I think one of the puzzle pieces into which Kulinarya and the Pamangan pop up fit is answering the call to create. If the pop-ups we've run are any indication of the hunger Boston has for Filipino food and our take on our Kapampangan heritage, we're also getting at another piece: 
The desire to have the Filipino-inspired food that Pamangan is serving is clear. Dare we say... ardent.
Filipino food in Boston. Why not, indeed!




But This Isn't Just About Filipino Food
While we are filling this void of Filipino food in Boston, what’s even more important to us is that we do this work in a way that takes care of everyone involved — that’s diners and all the people that work hard to put that food in front of you. From the beginning, we want our voice to carry a message that says food is more than a transaction. 
Our restaurant will be an echo chamber for all the important work people are already doing to change the way that people think about food consumption. People are behind every part of that process and our mission is to be intentional about recognizing that in a practical way. 
For us, that means sourcing from farms and other producers who have a sense of purpose beyond profit and who treat their folks well. That means starting with a living wage for the people that work with us and working to provide them benefits and ways of plugging into the business. That means thinking about you, and how our food nourishes your health, but also your soul (that beind said, there's always time and place for lechon).

So Where Does My Money Go?
 Funding a restaurant is an expensive and risky endeavor. That's not lost on us and it's why we believe your contribution is an essential part of giving the restaurant the best shot it has. We have a concept (tapas bar!) and a realistic idea of how much money we'll need (a lot!) -- so your piece comes into making sure the space we decide to make our home is in the right place and is on favorable terms. 
Many bootstrapped restaurant businesses not only cut corners but rush into decisions without enough consideration, and we want to avoid that. $20,000 of your contribution will go towards legal, financial and marketing counsel as we make our first move: securing a space.
The rest will go towards supplementing the funds we pay into the pop-up to develop the menu, find a place in town that'll let us be a regular fixture and explore questions like ""What does it take for us to pay all our staff a living wage and still survive the restaurant grind?"" ""How can we involve the people who grow and raise our food in our business?"" and ""What can we do to continue to rethink the hierarchy of the kitchen and the floor?""
So, are you wondering why there isn't Filipino food in Boston? Are you wondering why Filipino food hasn't had the same presence that other food cultures have? Do you live in Boston and want to be part of bringing a culture that needs representation to the place you call home? Do you live elsewhere and care about the representation of the Filipino diaspora? DONATE!
We've got 30 days to make it happen! If we meet our goal, let's party! Pamangan will throw a holiday party for all our contributors in Boston!
    About the Project Thus Far 
While we both had a lot of personal and professional experience, we started this project flying by the seats of our pants. We really had no expectation for this beyond being able to do something together that we’ve always done, put ourselves wholly into the task of creating and cooking and serving food, something that has always been an expression of love in our family. The intensity of support and excitement for more of what we were doing was inspiring and without hesitation, both me and my brother felt we had to do it again.
Since August of 2014, we’ve hosted this dinner in many places, turning everything from gallery spaces to cafes into restaurants for a night. My brother often takes a red-eye flight on a Friday night to be here for a weekend of insanity and we’ve made lots of connections to folks and facilitated connections between folks who are completely supportive of bringing Filipino food to Boston. Since that first pop up, our idea of what we want has become more and more concrete and it’s clear to both of us that we want to give Filipino food a permanent home in Boston. What that means is a restaurant and that’s why we’re asking for your help.
Personally, I’ve explored many different paths… it’s almost cliche that I return to the place I began, making Filipino food. One of my first memories is of being at the stove with my dad, on a step stool, stirring a sauce while he showed me what to watch for as it thickened. With my dad being a chef, and with our house being the house that all family and friend gatherings happened, and with so many positive memories around the preparation of food, making food is a way for me to bring the social and sharing culture of it that I’ve known all my life.   Does My Contribution Absolutely, Positively Guarantee This Restaurant Is Happening?  The short and disappointing answer is ""no."" What's important to say is that there are lots of pieces that are crucial to opening any restaurant's doors and unforeseeable things can happen that stall or halt the process. That being said, we're repositioning our lives to give this project everything it needs to become a brick and mortar. 
RJ is going to be one of the major investors in the business and I will be 100% focused on the task of bringing the restaurant to life, and running it once we've welcomed you in.
Your contribution is an essential piece to giving this restaurant the best chance possible here in Boston and acts two-fold: it shows investors that there is undeniable support and demand for a Filipino restaurant in Boston and it provides us with the capital necessary to secure a space and to develop best practices that will inform the restaurant.
Money Is Hard to Come By, But I Still Want to Support!
 Tell your friends and urge them to donate. That is one of the most helpful things you can do! If there's one specific thing we'd like to ask all of you to do is record a 15-second video to put on Instagram or Facebook about why you think Pamangan should be a restaurant! Tag it with #PamanganPopUp and #RestaurantorBust2016 and we'll feature it and shower you with many, many thanks!
I also know you have mad skills. The business of making a restaurant go is much, much more than chopping onions with lightning speed and zero tearing (but if that's one of your many talents, then I wanna hear about it!). Email me at ellie@kulinarya.us and let's sit down for coffee.

I Got Other Questions
Q: It's that gift-giving time of year. What if I want to send a perk to someone else?
A: Easy-peasy! Just use their name and address in the shipping information. If you find there's any problem at all with this, email Ellie at ellie@kulinarya.us!
Q: What if I want to just pick up my perk from you?

A: This is possible, but only for a limited time and you need to tell me by December 16th! You can pick the perk up at a pop-up or locally in the Boston area dates all throughout the second half of December. As far as I can tell, Indie Go Go won't offer optional shipping, so if you come our way, I can offer you a refund of your shipping cost. I'll ship in January if I have somehow missed you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3> <p>The Kettle Falls Five are 5 qualified medical marijuana patients in Washington State that have been prosecuted &amp; persecuted by the United States Federal Government since 2012 and were just sentenced to years in Federal Prison for following their doctors medical marijuana prescriptions and theirs Washington State law. A little background on the events leading up to now:<br/></p> <ul> <li>August 9th, 2012 (first SWAT team raid) - Stevens County Sheriff's office, WA State Patrol, US Border Patrol &amp; DEA officers and agents conduct a SWAT team raid after the United States Civil Air Patrol flew over Rhonda &amp; Larry Harvey's 33 acre property and spotted what they thought was a small outdoor medical marijuana grow. The first raid was executed with a Stevens County Sheriff's office warrant. Rhonda was the only one home. Immediately Rhonda shared the 5 valid medical marijuana prescriptions with the Sheriff. The Sheriff called the local county prosecutor who told the Sheriff to not arrest anyone but to leave the 45 plants in the ground because they were following &amp; in compliance with the state law RCW 69.51a. Even though these state legal medical marijuana patients were in compliance with state law, the Sheriff's office still confiscated and seized all of Larry's hunting rifles and the Honda four-wheeler the older couple used to drive around their property. This may have been because DEA agent Sam Keiser was present. Although this first SWAT team raid was under the jurisdiction of Sgt. Loren A. Erdman who was sworn to uphold State law.</li>
<li>August 16th, 2012 (second SWAT team raid) - Stevens County Sheriff's office, WA State Patrol, US Border Patrol &amp; DEA officers and agents conduct a second SWAT team raid 7 days after the State raid, this time with a Federal Search Warrant led by DEA agent Sam Keiser. They proceeded to destroy the 45 harmless outdoor medical marijuana plants, to confiscate &amp; seize Rhonda's 2006 Saturn SUV, two Suzuki motorcycles, the home computer &amp; $700 in cash. No arrests were made that day. The US government DEA thugs simply came with automatic weapons &amp; moving trucks then destroyed, stole property that wasn't theirs and left.  <br/>
</li>
<li>February 2013  - United States Government charges and arrests 5 sate legal medical marijuana patients via Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington Michael Ormsby who charged Rhonda Firestack-Harvey, Larry Harvey, Rolland Gregg, Michelle Gregg &amp; Heather Zucker with the following 7 major federal drug charges including: <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>21 U.S.C. S 846 Conspiracy to Manufacture and Distribute 100 or More Marijuana Plants (Count 1)</li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>February 2013 (third SWAT team raid) - Stevens County Sheriff's office, WA State Patrol, US Border Patrol, Kirkland Police, Seattle Police &amp; DEA officers/agents conduct a SWAT team raid on 3 separate houses at 6 AM. Rhonda &amp; Larry Harvey near Kettle Falls, WA; their son &amp; daughter and law's house in Kirkland, WA; Jason &amp; Heather Zucker in Seattle, WA. <br/>
</li>
<li>Everyone was arrested &amp; taken to Federal Prison and released after weeks in prison. Everyone was released on what's called ""appearance bonds."" Meaning all 5 medical marijuana patients now had to follow 16 different 'conditions of release'. Meaning that if we didn't follow the US governments orders, we would be taken back to Prison immediately (can't leave the State of WA, can't follow our doctors orders and use our medical marijuana for the ailments that the doctors prescribed us the mmj, can't have contact with ANY of the other co-defendants, can't be out of the house past 9 PM, must drive to Federal Probation office in Seattle &amp; Spokane to pee in a cup and take urine analysis every week and many more conditions).  <br/>
</li>
<li>2013, 2014 we fight to push the court case out with continuances in hopes that Congress will change the laws as we lobby hard in Washington D.C. Larry Harvey and Kari Boiter from Americans For Safe Access make many trips to Washington D.C. to testify before Congress about how the Federal drug laws are harming innocent patients and usurping State Medical Marijuana Laws being passed by The People in 40 states now. <br/>
</li>
<li>December 17th, 2014 - President Obama signs into law the first time ever that Medical Marijuana was mentioned and protected from Federal interference with Section 538 of the 2015 Continuing Appropriations Act, the ""cromnibus"". We thought this would stop the prosecution because Section 538 states, ""None of the
funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with

Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky,

<li>March 3rd, 2015 - The trial starts at the Thomas Foley US Federal Courthouse in Spokane, WA. Six days later after a full day of jury deliberation, the jury comes back with not-guilty on 4 of 5 charges. The last charge was actually a ""lesser included crime"" of manufacturing over 50 and under 100 plants. So we were literally convicted of exactly what is legal under Washington State Medical Marijuana laws RCW 69.51a. <br/>

We will also be refining the prototype with molding engineers to make sure that the overall look and feel is the best that we can get during the molding process. These steps involve softening the edges and adding more defined radiuses to the entire device. Not only will this allow an easier molding process, but a more refined overall look.

<p>This program is not a diet nor is a fitness routine, but a
total lifestyle transformation program with a special emphasis on developing
the mindset that is needed to achieve success. </p><p>
</p><p><b>WHY ARE WE DOING THIS</b></p>
<p>Alex and Avril Baxter know first hand what it is like to be
overweight and out of shape.  We have
lost a combined 150 lbs. and kept it off for over 6 years.  We want to teach others how to do it because
we know how getting fit and healthy completely changes your life for the better.  About 2 years ago we started a free

eating and exercising.</p>
<p>We have found that the main reason people fail to keep
excess weight off is that they do not change their unhealthy lifestyle.  Some people try fad, quick diets or starve

don’t even try because they know its not a long term solution.</p>

<p><b>PROGRAM OVERVIEW</b></p>
<p>The GetStartedLosingWeight.com program is 8 weeks of transformation
by incrementally breaking old habits and establishing healthy ones.  Every week starts with a motivational video
that outlines the objectives of the week and addresses the emotional challenges
subscribers will encounter in the week ahead. 
Each day subscribers receive a beginner level exercise video with
instruction from the Baxter’s.  They also
receive two videos a week on practical ways to eat healthy while balancing a
real life of kids and work.  Finally,
subscribers watch a personal message from us that recaps the week’s
accomplishments and celebrates the completion of another transformative week. </p>
<p><b>IMPACT</b></p>
<p>The financial cost of being overweight and out of shape are
enormous in terms of increases in sickness and disease, but the real cost is
the reduced quality of life.  Being
overweight means there are simply things you can’t do or worse yet things you
avoid doing because of your weight.</p>
<p>It’s the inability to coach your kid’s sports team or maybe it’s
the poor example you set for your kids by being overweight and out of shape.  It could be depressing intimacy with your
mate or suppressing your ability to attract a mate.  Or it may simply be a lack of self confidence
that holds you back from living a full and satisfied life.</p>

<h3>By participating in our crowdfunding campaign, you'll receive the nestCARE products and program at a (very) discounted price prior to our public launch.</h3>
<p><strong>Purchase nestCARE before the public at a very reduced cost</strong>. <strong>Here's what you'll receive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Our proprietary device bundle, including a wearable and three devices</strong>. Our discreet, low-profile wearable tracks activity and sleep patterns; it also serves as a medications reminder. Our devices include a smart scale, a pulse oximeter (measures BPM and pulse ox), and a blood pressure cuff. All devices including the wearable are Bluetooth-enabled, so they'll transmit the data directly to the nestCARE app automatically with a simple confirmation.</li>
<li>
<strong>A subscription to our app</strong> (available on smartphones and tablets). Our app acts as a personal wellness coach, guiding users to develop and continue with health-at-home habits such as proper hydration, medication adherence, and regular movement. nestCARE tracks pain, mood and sleep patterns as well. Additionally, our app also acts as a communication hub for a user's designated support network and provides an all-in-one home base for a user's electronic medical records.</li>
<li>Thoughtful ""how-to"" videos and a step-by-step guide for program setup</li>
<li>nestCARE support</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471904918/scjm9kcgcjdhdfr6mxso.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Gift nestCARE to a loved one who could benefit from our program</strong> (Mom/Dad, loved one) <strong>or purchase the program for yourself!</strong></p>
<p>Imagine your medical history and baseline over time, all in one place. Imagine having a truly comprehensive picture of your health – see how your meds affect your mood or how sleep patterns affect your pain levels, for example.</p>
<p>There are 8760 hours in one year and we spend maybe two-three of them at a doctor's office. What can we truly glean about our health from those quick visits?</p>
<p><strong>Hospital care is sick care. nestCARE is health at home on your watch, with a bigger picture focus.</strong></p>
<p>The unique insights provided by our program will help you (or your loved ones) better understand your unique wellness snapshot. You can modify behaviors or medications over time, allowing for a better quality of life. (Less time spent sick means more time spent doing what you love!) </p>
<p>If you're not ready to buy nestCARE just yet, no problem! You can also support our cause of bringing health into the home by supporting us at the $15 or $40 level. The $40 gets you a super-soft nestCARE tee, too!</p>
<p>FYI – the user must have access to a smartphone or tablet in order to participate in the program.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Greater Good </h3>
<p><strong>The impact a program like nestCARE could have on society could be monumental.</strong></p>
<p>There are <strong>70+ million</strong> ""boomers and beyond"" and veterans in the US alone. The reality is that both groups are incredibly underserved when it comes to supporting their health and wellness management while away from professional healthcare facilities... not only in the US, but globally as well.</p>
<p>Hospital care is sick care. Health and wellness management shouldn't be a passive enterprise. With 10k+ baby boomers turning 65 *every day* in America alone, the sustainability of our health care system directly depends on our personal involvement and interest in the care of ourselves and those we love.</p>
<p>We know that it's not just boomers + vets that can benefit from the nestCARE program, but we believe that <a href=""http://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2016/04/25/a-silver-tsunami-is-about-to-hit-u-s-health-care/ideas/up-for-discussion/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">focusing on these groups</a> will allow us to have the greatest impact in changing the landscape of public health through holistic, community-based care.</p>
<h3>We're Crowdfunding Because...</h3>
<p><strong>We want to bring nestCARE to the rest of the world.</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://bipartisanpolicy.org/library/recommendations-for-healthy-aging/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Well-being begins at home</a>, outside of the clinic or hospital setting. Knowledge is power and we want to help you better care for yourself or those you love by connecting the dots between vitals, meds, and general wellness.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide you with genuinely useful wellness information that translates into powerful knowledge.</p>
<p>Any funds we raise from this campaign will go into our operating capital and will primarily be used for the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Purchase of devices (we need a sizable inventory up front)</li>
<li>Development / expansion of our analytics capabilities, providing unique insights for nestCARE users and their support network</li>
</ol>
<p>All donations (save for where noted) will receive the actual nestCARE program – the device bundle + a designated subscription – at a discounted ""pre-public launch"" price. We've got some great perks on the way and a few different donation levels outlined here, too.</p>
<p>People who opt-in to purchase the program early will also be asked to join our<b> nestCARE guide program. </b>This community of thoughtful users and buyers will be asked for their feedback on the product in order to help guide our development and direction.</p>
<p><i>Our nestCARE guides will act a sort of consumer steering committee</i>, helping us to get it right. We can't make this program a reality without your thoughtful and diverse feedback! </p>
<p>Let's change the face health care together one ""nest"" at a time.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471286206/uk60ceeie2qthwxowqds.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>What sets nestCARE apart: real, human connection and encouragement. <strong>Change isn't easy and staying healthy requires effort.</strong> By connecting loved ones, friends, and medical professionals to a user at the point of healthcare management, we create accountability and community around an otherwise singular experience. It's why group fitness classes work and why you'll find online communities dedicated to paleo dieting. Encouragement breeds success!</p>

<p>By supporting our nestCARE efforts now, you will have a direct hand in not only making a difference in your life and that of your loved ones, but also in making it possible to deliver this program to countless individuals who'd benefit greatly from its existence.</p>
<p><strong>The nestCARE device-based app allows those wanting or needing to get a better handle on their health at home efforts to actually SEE a comprehensive picture of their health and truly understand it, over time.</strong> I</p>
<p>+Imagine vital concerns no longer going unnoticed for weeks.</p>
<p>+Imagine medication adherence made simple.</p>
<p>+Imagine how developing healthy habits becomes less of a chore and more of a group exercise.</p>
<p>+Imagine true connection and support for those who need it most – our elders and our veterans.</p>
<p><strong>We believe nestCARE can play a serious supporting role in making these things happen.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473348626/emawynr1lno1uzqc6ega.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Risks/Challenges</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Our small but seasoned team is hungry to make a positive change.</strong> That said, we know that getting folks to adopt new technologies isn't easy. We also know that society isn't quite there yet in making the connection between preventive wellness management and quality of life. We hope to help the millions of folks 55+ (as well as veterans and those with chronic conditions) to manage their wellness outside a clinical setting. </p>
<p><i>Our single biggest challenge will be to help ensure adoption with our target demographic.</i> Countless other companies have tried and failed to introduce technology to these groups –we cannot shy away from this reality. Instead, we choose to embrace it knowing that nestCARE has the potential to change the landscape of public health.</p>
<p>We overcome these challenges by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engaging with advocates/the support network from day one to ensure users aren't alone on their journey</li>
<li>Accepting that no user will immediately leverage every aspect of the nestCARE solution from day one</li>
<li>Recognizing that adoption and compliance will mimic a ""slow boil"" – every new nest is a small victory!</li>
<li>Expecting hiccups along the way and in turn, addressing and solving the problems through user education, outreach, and community management</li>
</ul>
</div><div>

There are 8760 hours in one year and we spend maybe two-three of them at a doctor's office. What can we truly glean about our health from those quick visits?
Hospital care is sick care. nestCARE is health at home on your watch, with a bigger picture focus.
The unique insights provided by our program will help you (or your loved ones) better understand your unique wellness snapshot. You can modify behaviors or medications over time, allowing for a better quality of life. (Less time spent sick means more time spent doing what you love!) 
If you're not ready to buy nestCARE just yet, no problem! You can also support our cause of bringing health into the home by supporting us at the $15 or $40 level. The $40 gets you a super-soft nestCARE tee, too!
FYI – the user must have access to a smartphone or tablet in order to participate in the program.


The Greater Good 
The impact a program like nestCARE could have on society could be monumental.
There are 70+ million ""boomers and beyond"" and veterans in the US alone. The reality is that both groups are incredibly underserved when it comes to supporting their health and wellness management while away from professional healthcare facilities... not only in the US, but globally as well.
Hospital care is sick care. Health and wellness management shouldn't be a passive enterprise. With 10k+ baby boomers turning 65 *every day* in America alone, the sustainability of our health care system directly depends on our personal involvement and interest in the care of ourselves and those we love.
We know that it's not just boomers + vets that can benefit from the nestCARE program, but we believe that focusing on these groups will allow us to have the greatest impact in changing the landscape of public health through holistic, community-based care.
We're Crowdfunding Because...
We want to bring nestCARE to the rest of the world.
Well-being begins at home, outside of the clinic or hospital setting. Knowledge is power and we want to help you better care for yourself or those you love by connecting the dots between vitals, meds, and general wellness.
Our goal is to provide you with genuinely useful wellness information that translates into powerful knowledge.
Any funds we raise from this campaign will go into our operating capital and will primarily be used for the following:

Purchase of devices (we need a sizable inventory up front)
Development / expansion of our analytics capabilities, providing unique insights for nestCARE users and their support network

All donations (save for where noted) will receive the actual nestCARE program – the device bundle + a designated subscription – at a discounted ""pre-public launch"" price. We've got some great perks on the way and a few different donation levels outlined here, too.
People who opt-in to purchase the program early will also be asked to join our nestCARE guide program. This community of thoughtful users and buyers will be asked for their feedback on the product in order to help guide our development and direction.
Our nestCARE guides will act a sort of consumer steering committee, helping us to get it right. We can't make this program a reality without your thoughtful and diverse feedback! 
Let's change the face health care together one ""nest"" at a time.



What sets nestCARE apart: real, human connection and encouragement. Change isn't easy and staying healthy requires effort. By connecting loved ones, friends, and medical professionals to a user at the point of healthcare management, we create accountability and community around an otherwise singular experience. It's why group fitness classes work and why you'll find online communities dedicated to paleo dieting. Encouragement breeds success!

By supporting our nestCARE efforts now, you will have a direct hand in not only making a difference in your life and that of your loved ones, but also in making it possible to deliver this program to countless individuals who'd benefit greatly from its existence.
The nestCARE device-based app allows those wanting or needing to get a better handle on their health at home efforts to actually SEE a comprehensive picture of their health and truly understand it, over time. I
+Imagine vital concerns no longer going unnoticed for weeks.
+Imagine medication adherence made simple.
+Imagine how developing healthy habits becomes less of a chore and more of a group exercise.
+Imagine true connection and support for those who need it most – our elders and our veterans.
We believe nestCARE can play a serious supporting role in making these things happen.


Risks/Challenges
Our small but seasoned team is hungry to make a positive change. That said, we know that getting folks to adopt new technologies isn't easy. We also know that society isn't quite there yet in making the connection between preventive wellness management and quality of life. We hope to help the millions of folks 55+ (as well as veterans and those with chronic conditions) to manage their wellness outside a clinical setting. 
Our single biggest challenge will be to help ensure adoption with our target demographic. Countless other companies have tried and failed to introduce technology to these groups –we cannot shy away from this reality. Instead, we choose to embrace it knowing that nestCARE has the potential to change the landscape of public health.
We overcome these challenges by:

Engaging with advocates/the support network from day one to ensure users aren't alone on their journey
Accepting that no user will immediately leverage every aspect of the nestCARE solution from day one
Recognizing that adoption and compliance will mimic a ""slow boil"" – every new nest is a small victory!
Expecting hiccups along the way and in turn, addressing and solving the problems through user education, outreach, and community management

It was while there that I became aware of the terrible human rights violations that plague every country on this planet, some worse than others. In the gracious faces of the many orphans living just outside of Moldova's capital city of Chisinău, where we volunteered in partnership with the Clipa Siderală children’s foundation, I saw the damage that globalization, corruption, and apathy have caused in these forgotten areas of the world. I saw first-hand what happens to families ripped apart by human trafficking and broken political and economic systems, and it was thus in Eastern Europe that I first realized that I wanted to be a part of the fight against social injustice, both in my home country and on an international level.</p><p>Today, centuries after the globalization of forced labor practices, and well over a century after the abolition of slavery and involuntary servitude in the United States, <strong>an estimated 20- to 30-million people worldwide are victims of forced labor and slavery-like practices</strong>; and, every day, in numerous countries around the world, <strong>innocent people are persecuted, tortured, and even killed</strong>, by state and non-state actors, <strong>because of their sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious beliefs</strong>, and so forth. Many of these individuals, whether forced into modern-day slavery or whether persecuted simply for being themselves, lack the means, logistically and financially, to escape their situations, and, if and when they do escape, they often have nowhere safe to go and no one to whom they can turn for help. Then, even if and when they do receive help, they are still left to deal with the <strong>lasting emotional, mental, and physical trauma</strong> of the situations from which they came.</p><p>Thus, while education, community awareness, and advocacy are key for making strides to combat human rights violations on all levels, there is also a need for attention to healing, community, and lifelong wellness. This is where yoga comes in, for it is ""[t]he <strong>necessity of pursuing happiness</strong> [that is] the <strong>foundation of liberty</strong>. As therefore the highest perfection of intellectual nature lies in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness; so the care of ourselves, that we mistake not imaginary for real happiness, is the necessary foundation of our liberty. The stronger ties we have to an unalterable pursuit of happiness in general, which is our <strong>greatest good</strong>, and which, as such, our desires always follow, the more are we free from any necessary determination of our will to any particular action"" (John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, 1894).</p><p><strong>Health and wellness are fundamental to human happiness</strong>, and I believe that these elements are <strong>foundational for basic human rights</strong>. Yoga serves as a powerful tool for <strong>restoring peace and joy in a life imprisoned by trauma, depression, anger, and shame</strong>; and, for me, practicing yoga has been a source of strength and healing, through life's expected and unexpected trials and tribulations, showing me over the last 4 years that I am stronger, body and mind, than I ever thought I could be. It is this strength and the peace and stability that flow with it that bring me back to the mat day in and day out, and it is this strength, peace, and stability that I wish to share with others in becoming a yoga instructor. Therefore, in addition to pursuing human rights work from a policy/advocacy/legal background, I also hope, in my career, to focus on human rights work from a trauma-sensitive wellness perspective -- <strong>by</strong> <strong>sharing the healing and strengthening powers of yoga, mindful eating and living, creative arts, and outdoor adventure with those who may benefit from it most</strong>. </p><p>I come to the table having studied, trained, and worked in the areas of trauma-informed care, expressive arts, immigrant detention facilities and populations, human rights and humanitarianism, outdoor education, and youth wellness and development; and it is my goal that by pursuing my yoga teacher certification, that I may teach my love of yoga and develop the same with young women from around this world. As such, I hope to <strong>serve as a source for research and healing for unaccompanied minors and youth ages 11-24 who have suffered human rights violations, helping these youth to overcome the horrors of their past, to choose and be empowered to move forward in life as their fullest potential selves, and to lead full, joyous lives untarnished by past harms</strong>. </p><p>Our youth are our future, and in helping them, we help ourselves. </p><h3><u>The Timeline</u></h3><p>I have the opportunity to complete my 200-hour yoga teacher certification at a discounted rate here in my home city of San Diego through my work trade program with Spirit Yoga.

It was while there that I became aware of the terrible human rights violations that plague every country on this planet, some worse than others. In the gracious faces of the many orphans living just outside of Moldova's capital city of Chisinău, where we volunteered in partnership with the Clipa Siderală children’s foundation, I saw the damage that globalization, corruption, and apathy have caused in these forgotten areas of the world. I saw first-hand what happens to families ripped apart by human trafficking and broken political and economic systems, and it was thus in Eastern Europe that I first realized that I wanted to be a part of the fight against social injustice, both in my home country and on an international level.Today, centuries after the globalization of forced labor practices, and well over a century after the abolition of slavery and involuntary servitude in the United States, an estimated 20- to 30-million people worldwide are victims of forced labor and slavery-like practices; and, every day, in numerous countries around the world, innocent people are persecuted, tortured, and even killed, by state and non-state actors, because of their sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious beliefs, and so forth. Many of these individuals, whether forced into modern-day slavery or whether persecuted simply for being themselves, lack the means, logistically and financially, to escape their situations, and, if and when they do escape, they often have nowhere safe to go and no one to whom they can turn for help. Then, even if and when they do receive help, they are still left to deal with the lasting emotional, mental, and physical trauma of the situations from which they came.Thus, while education, community awareness, and advocacy are key for making strides to combat human rights violations on all levels, there is also a need for attention to healing, community, and lifelong wellness. This is where yoga comes in, for it is ""[t]he necessity of pursuing happiness [that is] the foundation of liberty. As therefore the highest perfection of intellectual nature lies in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness; so the care of ourselves, that we mistake not imaginary for real happiness, is the necessary foundation of our liberty. The stronger ties we have to an unalterable pursuit of happiness in general, which is our greatest good, and which, as such, our desires always follow, the more are we free from any necessary determination of our will to any particular action"" (John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, 1894).Health and wellness are fundamental to human happiness, and I believe that these elements are foundational for basic human rights. Yoga serves as a powerful tool for restoring peace and joy in a life imprisoned by trauma, depression, anger, and shame; and, for me, practicing yoga has been a source of strength and healing, through life's expected and unexpected trials and tribulations, showing me over the last 4 years that I am stronger, body and mind, than I ever thought I could be. It is this strength and the peace and stability that flow with it that bring me back to the mat day in and day out, and it is this strength, peace, and stability that I wish to share with others in becoming a yoga instructor. Therefore, in addition to pursuing human rights work from a policy/advocacy/legal background, I also hope, in my career, to focus on human rights work from a trauma-sensitive wellness perspective -- by sharing the healing and strengthening powers of yoga, mindful eating and living, creative arts, and outdoor adventure with those who may benefit from it most. I come to the table having studied, trained, and worked in the areas of trauma-informed care, expressive arts, immigrant detention facilities and populations, human rights and humanitarianism, outdoor education, and youth wellness and development; and it is my goal that by pursuing my yoga teacher certification, that I may teach my love of yoga and develop the same with young women from around this world. As such, I hope to serve as a source for research and healing for unaccompanied minors and youth ages 11-24 who have suffered human rights violations, helping these youth to overcome the horrors of their past, to choose and be empowered to move forward in life as their fullest potential selves, and to lead full, joyous lives untarnished by past harms. Our youth are our future, and in helping them, we help ourselves. The TimelineI have the opportunity to complete my 200-hour yoga teacher certification at a discounted rate here in my home city of San Diego through my work trade program with Spirit Yoga.
