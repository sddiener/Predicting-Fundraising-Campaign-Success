<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Most of my readers know me as a horror novelist. Over the past seven years -- <i>seven years, </i>I type, only to realize just how astounding it's been <i>so </i>long -- I've published three novels in the <i>Damnation Saga</i>: <i>Teddy, Wake, </i>and <i>In the House of Wolves.  </i></p>
<p>I was born in East Tennessee in 1985 and currently live in Florida. I possess degrees in psychology and English, and I live with my significant other Christine and our two dogs, Bandit and Rory, both of whom provide a constant distraction from my writing.<br/><br/>While my first forays into the world of writing were prose, my earliest publications were poetry. One of my poems was selected for inclusion in an anthology when I was in middle school, and I kept writing poetry throughout the years. While I honed my craft in regard to prose, I churned out a ton of poetry in my early twenties. I ultimately published <i>five </i>books of poetry [three of which are no longer readily available] before I published my first novel <i>Teddy.</i></p>
<p>And then... well, seven years passed. I was still writing poetry, but my output in that arena slowed. I started talking about this title with friends as early as four, even five years ago, thinking, <i>Oh, it'll be out next year. I'm sure it'll be ready.</i></p>
<p>It wasn't. It needed longer to gestate. I needed more time for my poetic focus to evolve past where it was when I released the last poetry book, <i>Wasted Days, </i>in 2013.</p>
<p>But here we are, <i>nearly eight years later, </i>with <strong><i>Black Tie, White Noose.</i></strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Welcome to my <i>black tie </i>affair.<br/>Please ensure your <i>white noose</i> is firmly secure.</b></p>
<p>So what can you expect from <i>Black Tie, White Noose</i>? The poetry in this particular outing marks an evolution in the way I think. The topics here are just as diverse as they always have been, but I've grown a little older, gotten a little wiser (I hope), and the poetry reflects this... but I also like to tell a story, and there are a few lurking in these poems as well -- tales in which I may be the storyteller, but I'm certainly <i>not </i>the narrator if you dig it.

<p>The time has come to share this little trove of poetic secrets with you.

</div><div>
<h3>What I Need, What You Get</h3>
<p>So, why have I turned to crowdfunding for the release of <i>Black Tie, White Noose</i>? As an independent author, it is a difficult proposition to launch a book without resources. The funding from this endeavor allows me to launch <i>Black Tie, White Noose </i>​properly while forging a direct relationship with my readership. I want you to feel like you're as much a part of this release as I am. I want it to mean as much to you as it does to me. Without you, dear readers, I'd still be writing stories only for myself. You make these endeavors all the more fulfilling.</p>
<p>In the past, I ""ninja released"" my poetry, told friends, and moved on with my day. Now that I'm established with my fiction, the motivating factor in establishing this campaign was that I wanted to give readers the chance to acquire signed copies of the new work as well as give them a chance to collect signed copies of titles they haven't collected... and that I don't normally keep on hand in my personal stock, namely the older poetry books that are still in circulation: <i>Tennessee Refugee </i>and <i>Wasted Days.</i></p>

<p>I'm looking to raise a minimum of $500. While these funds will allow me to order copies of the novel and ship them to backers, it also allows me to prepare for additional marketing. As an author, I'm looking to expand my readership. Ultimately, my goal is to write full-time. I, like many other independent authors, have a day job, and therefore I write on the side. If I'm able to write full-time, you'll see releases more often, which means you'll get material from me faster. That's always a good thing in my book! (I'm hoping my next work of fiction will be ready for publication in either 2022, early 2023 at the latest.)</p>
<p>By contributing a minimum of $1, you'll see your name in the finished work in the acknowledgments.</p>
<p>Ravenshaw Art is also providing art prints of the Jack card as well as the front and back covers as add-on perks!</p>
<p>This will be my fourth campaign. The first two successful campaigns for the <i>Teddy Dormer </i>novels <i>Teddy </i>and <i>Wake </i>were hosted by Pubslush, which is no longer active. With my third successful campaign for <i>In the House of Wolves, </i>I transitioned to Indiegogo.</p>
<p>My goal is to release <i>Black Tie, White Noose </i>in July 2021.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Of course, for some people, it's impossible to help the campaign right now. I understand. Life happens, and perhaps the timing isn't the best. If you still want to help, you can help me tremendously simply by sharing the hell out of this campaign. You can share it directly from Indiegogo to your social media pages!</p>
<p>Thank you for stopping by! I do hope to see your name in my book!</p>

Most of my readers know me as a horror novelist. Over the past seven years -- seven years, I type, only to realize just how astounding it's been so long -- I've published three novels in the Damnation Saga: Teddy, Wake, and In the House of Wolves.  
I was born in East Tennessee in 1985 and currently live in Florida. I possess degrees in psychology and English, and I live with my significant other Christine and our two dogs, Bandit and Rory, both of whom provide a constant distraction from my writing.While my first forays into the world of writing were prose, my earliest publications were poetry. One of my poems was selected for inclusion in an anthology when I was in middle school, and I kept writing poetry throughout the years. While I honed my craft in regard to prose, I churned out a ton of poetry in my early twenties. I ultimately published five books of poetry [three of which are no longer readily available] before I published my first novel Teddy.
And then... well, seven years passed. I was still writing poetry, but my output in that arena slowed. I started talking about this title with friends as early as four, even five years ago, thinking, Oh, it'll be out next year. I'm sure it'll be ready.
It wasn't. It needed longer to gestate. I needed more time for my poetic focus to evolve past where it was when I released the last poetry book, Wasted Days, in 2013.

<h3>The Bikeraft Guide - What Is It? A Book and...</h3>
<p>This community multi-media storytelling project will ultimately result in a comprehensive book on bikerafting (history of, stories from the most well-known bikerafters from around the world, and a how-to section). But, along the way we'll share audio interviews through our new <a href=""https://thebikeraftguide.podbean.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Bikeraft Guide Podcast</a>, plus photos and stories on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thebikeraftguide/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@TheBikeraftGuide</a> Instagram page and on the <a href=""https://fourcornersguides.com/thebikeraftguide/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Four Corners Guides website</a> &amp; <a href=""https://fourcornersguides.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a>. Our goal with the IndieGoGo Campaign is to raise $22K through pre-sales of the book and ""Perks"" donated by our sponsors. This will pay for printing, distribution, contributors and editing. We're really relying on you – aspiring bikerafters and people who love great adventure stories – to help us make this dream a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need: $22,000</h3>
<p>The funds will be used to pay the 20+ contributors, the editor (Eben Weiss of ""Bike Snob""), and to get the book printed and distributed.</p>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why This Book?!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Because Steve ""Doom"" Fassbinder is co-authoring it. An early adopter of bikerafting and owner of the only North American bikerafting guide service, Doom is one of the most knowledgeable bikerafters in the world.</li>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Hope You Will Support the Book!</h3>
<p>We don't have enough cash to publish this book yet. More than a dozen outdoor industry sponsors/advertisers helped us get started, paying for some contributors, marketing help and a down payment for the book's editor, among other things (<a href=""https://fourcornersguides.com/thebikeraftguide/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here to see all our amazing sponsors!</a>). But we still need cash to pay for printing, distribution, taxes and fees, plus to pay more of the contributors. BUT, we are confident pre-sales of our book and the amazing bikerafting-specific ""perks"" offered by our sponsors will get us to where we need to be.</p>
<h3>Why We're Uniquely Positioned to Write This Book</h3>
<ul>
<li>Steve ""Doom"" Fassbinder and Lizzy Scully own the only bikerafting guide service in North America, and Doom is a master bikerafter and storyteller.</li>
<li>Lizzy Scully, the other co-author, has been in the outdoor industry writing and editing for 20 years.</li>
<li>Eben Weiss, the author of ""Bike Snob"" and various other books, is also a long-time editor in the bike industry. He has the chops to edit a book like this, but also the wit to bring out the funny bits of our unusual, irreverent sport.</li>
<li>Elizabeth ""Liz"" Sampey is not only a badass multi-sport adventurer, but also a marketing whiz. She is both contributing to the book and is helping with the marketing of the giveaway we've been running since November and the IndieGoGo Campaign.</li>

<h3>Hello everyone! My name is Jonathan Fesmire. I'm a full-time writer and proud steampunk.</h3>
<p>Last year, I published my novel, <i>Bodacious Creed: a Steampunk Zombie Western</i> which started out as a Kickstarter. It more than met my funding goal and gave backers the opportunity to help create characters that shaped the story. Readers love the novel, which has more than 70 great reviews and is selling well.</p>
<p>Yes, crowdfunding works for novels!</p>
<p>Now, I'm working on the sequel, <i>Bodacious Creed and the Frisco Syndicate</i>. This campaign will help fund it, allowing me to pay for professional editing, cover art, and a portion of my reader's fee for the Audible edition.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, <i>Bodacious Creed and the Frisco Syndicate</i> will be full of steampunk technology, gunfights, mystery, and well-rounded characters. These include the hero, the resurrected U.S. Marshal, James Creed, and the brothel madam and inventor, Anna Lynn Boyd. It will also include a full cast of supporting characters.</p>
<p>While the first novel took place in an alternate version of my home town of Santa Cruz, California, in 1876, the second will happen mostly in San Francisco.</p>
<p>What was San Francisco like at the time? Wild, rowdy, and dangerous. I've been doing extensive research on the city and its most notorious criminal district, The Barbary Coast, where much of the tale will take place. In addition to historical crime, add a syndicate raising the dead with steam-based technology, and we have a formula for the sort of danger Creed was born to confront. His greatest challenges lie ahead.</p>
<p>Check out the video and any updates. Once we reach the goal, I'll add stretch goals. Also, have a look at the rewards and become a backer! Everyone backer gets something. Even at $1, you will get a large, high quality jpeg of the wrap-around trade paperback cover. I invite you to become part of James ""Bodacious"" Creed's next adventure!</p>
<h3>Why $1,500 for the Initial Goal?</h3>
<p>I have a helpful spreadsheet that allows me to calculate the least amount of backing I need to ask for in order to fund a project. It assumes that every backer selects the reward that will cost the most to fulfill compared to the pledge amount, and takes into account the various expenses associated with the project.</p>
<p>Yes, this shows $3,500 rather than $1,500. I'm going to write this book regardless of how much backing the project gets. The $1,500 will help a lot toward paying for the services I'll need. However, $3,500 will cover everything, so that's what I'm hoping for.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525497879/wwoinnla1fqiy4eutdyr.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Time. It took me four years to write the first book in this series. I was going through some serious financial and work difficulties for the first couple of years. Also, I spent much of that time developing the characters and the world of <i>Bodacious Creed</i>.</p>
<p>The book turned out longer than I expected! That's good, but it did add to the time it took to finish it. I figured it would be average novel length, at about 80,000 words. The first draft came out to 140,000, and the final draft, 120,000.</p>
<p>Now that I have a good, full-time writing job, meaning a lot more stability, and I have deep knowledge of my fictional world and its inhabitants, I can realistically extrapolate that it will take about two years to write, revise, edit, and publish.</p>
<p>It will take a lot of research to bring 1876 San Francisco to life, but I've already done most of that.</p>
<p>My track record of finishing books speaks for itself as far as my ability to complete this project goes. You, my backers, will get an exciting adventure you helped bring to life!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that not everyone can back a given project. Even so, consider the lower backer levels. I always make sure that even those who can only back a project for $1 get something.</p>
<p>If you can't even back at a low level, I understand, and I've been there myself.</p>
<p>Share the project on social media, or tell your friends about it! Word of mouth is critical in getting a project like this the funding it needs.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Nora Kayserian, an Armenian-American mother and lover of books. After my eldest niece was born, I came across many picture books about influential women like Frida Kahlo, Amelia Earhart, Rosa Parks, etc. Sadly, no such books could be found in Armenian about Armenian women. However, Armenian history is full of incredible women who were trailblazers and leaders of their time. And those were the stories I wanted to tell my niece about. So, I decided to create my own!</p>

<p><strong>Perks</strong></p>
<p>If you are interested in helping out with this campaign, there are some very exciting perks! You can support my campaign by pre-ordering a copy of the book for only $20. If you are interested in contributing more, there are perks available at various tiers. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The project will connect hundreds of school-aged children with a female hero who shares a similar ethnic background. The hero’s ethnicity and gender is connected to larger personal and social themes like facing challenges, overcoming obstacles and making a difference in your community. This can impact a child by helping them better understand society and concepts such as equality, fairness, and justice.</p>
<p>The project will also encourage parents and teachers to read to children in Western Armenian. By producing content that is engaging and fun, we can help foster a new generation of Western Armenian speakers. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have been working on this project for over a year and have researched printing, illustrating, publication, and writing in depth. The only possible risks I see at this point would be related to printing errors and shipping delays from the manufacturer. However, I have chosen a very reputable printing and publishing company in Armenia called <a href=""http://zangak.am/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zangak Publishing House</a> who has printed many high-quality books for self-publishers.</p>
<p>Distributing the book to my target audience, which are primarily Armenophone families and those trying to learn Armenian, is the next big step after the book is printed. I am working on creating a website and reaching out to Armenians and Armenian speakers through social media in order to raise awareness about this book and potential future projects. I have also been in touch with Armenian bookstores who have expressed strong interest in having this book available at their shops and helping with distribution once the book is published.</p>

Hi! I'm Nora Kayserian, an Armenian-American mother and lover of books. After my eldest niece was born, I came across many picture books about influential women like Frida Kahlo, Amelia Earhart, Rosa Parks, etc. Sadly, no such books could be found in Armenian about Armenian women. However, Armenian history is full of incredible women who were trailblazers and leaders of their time. And those were the stories I wanted to tell my niece about. So, I decided to create my own!
About the Book
""Անպարտելի Զապէլը"" is a picture book biography about Armenian writer and activist Zabel Yesayan. It is an inspirational story (in Western Armenian) about a girl who loved books and made history by pursuing her childhood dreams. From the moment she could read, she surrounded herself with words. Zabel discovered the magic between the pages of books and when she was seventeen, she began publishing her first piece of literature.
Zabel witnessed many injustices growing up and decided that she would fight for what's right with the most powerful weapon of all: words. Little did she know that, one day, she would be considered one of the most important writers of Western Armenian literature.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Earl A. Birkett. I am a resident of Jersey City, N.J. My background is as a real estate broker for the past 23 years. I have had positions in a multitude of fields, including teaching, business and journalism.</p>
<p>My plan is to publish BAVUAL, The African Heritage Magazine, a quarterly (4 issues per year) publication that is designed to explore the Afrocentric experience in world history, from the beginning of recorded time to the present.</p>
<p>Financiers will provide the seed money that will enable me to sustain the magazine's operations from pre-launch through the first few months of publication after the premiere issue, slated for Winter 2022 (December 2021 release).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am seeking an initial capitalization of $100,000, which will enable me to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pay for development costs</li>
<li>Pay a staff</li>
<li>Fund a direct mail subscription campaign</li>
<li>Publish the premiere issue</li>
</ol>
<p>In return for your minimum $60 contribution, you will receive a 2-year subscription to BAVUAL, valued at $120. The 2nd year will be FREE.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>MEANING OF THE TITLE AND SYMBOL</p>
<p>""Bavual"" is a male baby name with roots in Swahili that means ""power, strength, or force."" The name is quite popular among the Swahili-speaking people of East and Southern Africa, including Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. ""Adisa"" is Yoruba for ""one who is clear, or lucid."" </p>
<p>Bavual Adisa is a fictional person. He is 25 years old (born June 19th - Juneteenth - 1996), a native Tanzanian, but his residence is the world. He is from any country you wish him to be. His lineage dates back 680 centuries. He is the name of the magazine and the personification of its spirit and purpose: to document the African experience from the beginning of recorded history to today.</p>
<p>BAVUAL will publish features and regular departments on the key people, places and events that shaped black people and as a consequence, all peoples. It is not a black magazine produced solely by black people; it is for all people who are interested in understanding cause and effect in history from the perspective of a key race of people and produced by a multi-ethnic international staff. We are not advocates for a cause, a pedantic academic journal or a celebrity magazine; we are historic storytellers, placing the reader back in time and explaining how the present world came about as a result. Through its pages you will come away learning more than you did before about black history and primed to learn more.</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Any magazine publishing venture is risky, due to the nature of the business, the relatively high production cost, competition from the Web and shortened reader attention in the Twitter Age. Even so, we believe that BAVUAL is a magazine for this particular moment in history, when knowledge to counteract misinformation and preconceptions is the best antidote to confusion. We have assembled the staff and organized operations to take maximum advantage of this need while at the same time keeping operating costs low enough to weather the critical first 1-2 years of existence.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>First and foremost, we need your funds. However, if you cannot contribute at this time, spread the word on our new venture to friends, colleagues and family. We want them to be subscribers, readers and, if they so desire, advertisers. Please use the Indiegogo share tools.</p>

<p>Something lives in the woods behind Scott's new house. It's big, it's hairy, and it smells worse than a dead skunk in the rain. When Scott accepts a dare to camp in the woods all night, Hailey is the only friend who will help him. But Scott doesn't really believe in the creature lurking along Shaggy Creek—it's just a story, right?</p>

<p>Gavin and his sister Torrie aren't thrilled to be staying at Great Aunt Ethel's farm. It's in the middle of nowhere, Aunt Ethel is a little weird, and Gavin is forced to sleep on an old, lumpy feather bed.  Then Gavin discovers something worse: the lumps are moving. Torrie thinks he's just crazy—there's no way something's alive inside the mattress—until the lumps begin to hatch...</p>

But Scott doesn't really believe in the creature lurking along Shaggy Creek—it's just a story, right?

<h3>Cross the boundaries between time and worlds</h3>
<p>Star of Nimrod is the first of the Crystal Palace Chronicles trilogy.  Here’s what’s in store…</p>
<p><i>Joe is thirteen, lonely, and bored. His best friend moved away, he’s stuck looking after his annoying little sister and Dad spends every hour in their struggling restaurant, Paradise.  </i></p>
<p><i>But Joe's world is turned upside down when he discovers a shattered compass among the brambles where the Crystal Palace once stood and time travels through the maze back to 1888.</i></p>
<p><i>With help from the teenage H. G. Wells and Samuel Coleridge Taylor, daredevil Iris Blondin, the creator of Sherlock Holmes and the Queen of the Gypsies, Joe must foil dangerous diamond thieves to uncover dark secrets about the ‘People’s Palace'. Standing on boundaries between worlds, it's secrets are tied to the fate of his family.</i></p>
<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Will Joe be trapped in the past with his new friends, find a way to return to his family or can he somehow have both?</i></p>
<p><i style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Explore a world waiting behind the one you thought you knew, haunted by spirits that roamed the untamed Great North Wood, where the secrets of the past can make the ordinary extraordinary. </i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Bringing the past to life</h3>
<p>Here’s feedback from some of the brilliantly critical crew of 10 to 14 year olds who’ve helped me shape the story;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong><i>“It’s a story about realising what true friendships are.  What I found really good was the way Joe met up with famous people that were to become successful like Samuel Coleridge Taylor and Bertie who becomes H. G. Wells. It taught me much more about Crystal Palace and it’s a really entertaining book.”                                     </i></strong>Abdurehaman aged 13</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong><i>“Even when you feel you don’t love your family you love them deep inside especially if you’re away from them.”</i></strong>  Maia aged 12</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong><i>“I would recommend it to all my friends because it’s good to know more about where you live.” </i></strong> Spike aged 10</p>

<p>Growing up in the Norwoods I was aware the area is named after the Great North Wood that once spread across London’s hinterland.  My granddad sold programmes at the Crystal Palace and I love the mystical feel of Crystal Palace Park, the crumbling terraces of the ‘People’s Palace,’ the dinosaurs and sphinxes like phantoms from the past.  </p>
<p>I knew I wanted to capture this in a tale for the young and the young at heart. </p>
<p>What I didn’t know until I began my own adventure making this tale a reality, is the areas incredible history and the extraordinary people drawn to live in the palace’s shadow. </p>
<p>Everyone hears about the palace when it stood for six months in Hyde Park housing the Great Exhibition displaying artefacts looted from around the world which then ended up in London’s new museums. </p>
<p>But the palace itself relocated and dominated the Norwood Heights for <i>eight decades</i> until the mysterious fire destroyed it in 1936.  It became the world’s first theme park, offering education by recreating from scratch civilisations of the past alongside sell-out entertainment drawing in millions.</p>
<p>Overnight this area changed.  Navvies who constructed the Palace settled in Norwood New Town which had a wall built around it separating them from grand villas built by industrialists yearning for power.  Pioneers of science came searching for hidden truths, bored socialites came seeking fresh air, amusement and mischief.  The new Crystal Palace changed life here forever.</p>
<p><i>The Crystal Palace Chronicles</i> weave this fascinating history into a tale that can enthral kids today, capturing the goose-bumps I still get walking with my kids through the palace maze or beneath fragments of the Great North Wood. </p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p><i>Star of Nimrod</i> is my debut novel completed during lockdown.  I edited the Dev and Olli children’s books by Shweta Aggarwal and professional writing credits include a stage adaptation of the Shane Meadows film <i>24/7</i> and the UKs first immersive musical based on the classic Ealing Studio comedy <i>Passport to Pimlico</i>.  I know the audience I’m writing for because I’m lucky to experience young people’s imagination running award-winning charity DreamArts which fuses arts and therapy to transform young lives. </p>
<p>I enjoy helping bring our diverse communities together to share, create and celebrate; I’m Chair of Crystal Palace Festival and I’m on the board of the beautifully bonkers Stanley Halls (now Stanley Arts).  I help out on the events subgroup for the Crystal Palace Park Trust which will soon be taking over the park, and I’d love <i>The Crystal Palace Chronicles</i> to help put our unique area on the map.</p>
<p>   </p>
<h3>What is the funding for?</h3>
<p>You will be helping me realise the ambition of self-publishing this book.  I’m looking to raise £4,000 to cover the following costs;</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624600009/dyhgav3a5da6gzj6wxvz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So for example, if you’re choosing a £30 perk that contributes £25 after printing costs of your book and Indiegogo fees (fee 5% + 2.9% processing fee + 30p per pledge), and £50 contributes £41.</p>
<p>I’ve got a stretch target of £1,350 to employ a publicist to promote the book, and any additional funds raised will go towards delivering <i>Palace of Shadows</i>, the second book in <i>The Crystal Palace Chronicles</i> trilogy. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>Generally, the most significant risks with novel projects are whether the author will finish the book and can they write.  The good news is <i>Star of Nimrod</i> is written and awaiting publication in November to coincide with the 85<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Crystal Palace burning down.  And as for my ability as a storyteller you can read the first 10 chapters and see the feedback from readers and professionals. </p>
<p>The second and third books in the trilogy are plotted and underway.  And if I don’t meet my full target I still intend to make this happen and will offset any costs I don’t raise against future income when the book is released. </p>
<p>With regards to physical distribution of your perks, I’ve been lucky to get sage advise from experienced crowd-funders and look forward to getting your rewards to you.     </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why self-publish?</h3>
<p><i>Star of Nimrod</i> is aimed at 11-14 year olds (although it’s brilliant that much older readers have also loved it!) </p>
<p>It’s a readership group commercial publishing doesn’t cater for because their marketing constrictions are children’s books up to age 11 and young adult fiction targeting ages 13+.</p>
<p>As someone with an 11 and 13 year old I know the challenge of finding books that bridge David Walliams and The Hunger Games.</p>
<p>I’d love The Crystal Palace Chronicles to help fill that gap and keep growing readers entertained, educated and enthralled.   </p>

<h3>When will Star of Nimrod be delivered?</h3>
<p>Your exclusive preview copies will be ready for October, in advance of the book’s official launch in November 2021, the 85<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Crystal Palace burning down. </p>

<h3>Perks, Rewards, Helping a Luddite </h3>
<p>There's a range of rewards for being part of making this happen and thank you for considering contributing, it helps so much. </p>

My name is Graham Whitlock and I’m the author of The Crystal Palace Chronicles.
I believe there’s appetite for a rollercoaster fantasy adventure bringing this neighbourhood’s incredible history to life for the young and the young at heart.
Help prove me right, please support my self publishing costs and raise £4,000.
 
“Graham Whitlock takes readers on a clever and hilarious adventure.  It’s quirky and dark.  And so much fun.”                                                                                                         Carrie Jones, New York Times best-selling young adult author
 


 
Cross the boundaries between time and worlds
Star of Nimrod is the first of the Crystal Palace Chronicles trilogy.  Here’s what’s in store…
Joe is thirteen, lonely, and bored. His best friend moved away, he’s stuck looking after his annoying little sister and Dad spends every hour in their struggling restaurant, Paradise.  
But Joe's world is turned upside down when he discovers a shattered compass among the brambles where the Crystal Palace once stood and time travels through the maze back to 1888.
With help from the teenage H. G. Wells and Samuel Coleridge Taylor, daredevil Iris Blondin, the creator of Sherlock Holmes and the Queen of the Gypsies, Joe must foil dangerous diamond thieves to uncover dark secrets about the ‘People’s Palace'. Standing on boundaries between worlds, it's secrets are tied to the fate of his family.
Will Joe be trapped in the past with his new friends, find a way to return to his family or can he somehow have both?
Explore a world waiting behind the one you thought you knew, haunted by spirits that roamed the untamed Great North Wood, where the secrets of the past can make the ordinary extraordinary. 
 
Bringing the past to life
Here’s feedback from some of the brilliantly critical crew of 10 to 14 year olds who’ve helped me shape the story;
“It’s a story about realising what true friendships are.  What I found really good was the way Joe met up with famous people that were to become successful like Samuel Coleridge Taylor and Bertie who becomes H. G. Wells. It taught me much more about Crystal Palace and it’s a really entertaining book.”                                     Abdurehaman aged 13
“Even when you feel you don’t love your family you love them deep inside especially if you’re away from them.”  Maia aged 12
“I would recommend it to all my friends because it’s good to know more about where you live.”  Spike aged 10

<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Hello, my name is Cynthia Weeks. I am a teacher, children’s book author and founder of the social enterprise <a href=""https://www.projectfiasco.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Project Fiasco</a>, which has the goal of helping the environment.</p>
<p>We are crowdfunding to add another book to our collection. Our latest project is to collate and publish a book of love-themed short stories from around the world.</p>
<p>Our aim is to produce an uplifting and fun book. We also want to give our backers the opportunity to express themselves and tell their stories of love. <strong>We are offering the perk of having your story published in the book</strong>. At the same time, as Project Fiasco is a social enterprise focused on the environment, we will use part of the proceeds to fund pollution solutions. Doubly uplifting!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>To proceed with this book, we need at least $2000 AUD. We will use this money to pay for the editing, formatting, cover design, and printing of the book. The funds will also go towards crowdfunding costs such as Indiegogo fees, transaction costs, promotion and, of course the best part: perk fulfilment. We also need your stories! We have been collecting stories from around the globe and we would love more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Perks</strong></p>
<p>Through this book you will not only have the opportunity to read interesting stories from around the world, but you will also have the option to get your own story published in the book! </p>
<p>The perk options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Love Note sent to you or someone else by postcard</li>
<li>Your story being published in the book<strong>*</strong>
</li>
<li>An Ebook copy of the book</li>
<li>A paperback edition of the collection</li>
<li>Certificate of Contribution for sharing your story (a great gift idea until the book arrives!)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>*</strong>Love story guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>10-1000 words</li>
<li>You can use your first name, nickname, or alias</li>
<li>Please tell us the location your story. (City or town, and country)</li>
<li>The deadline for submissions is April 15th so you have plenty of time to complete it or time to fall in love and write about it. Good luck either way.</li>
<li>We will have an editor go over the story so do not be too worried about typos</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.projectfiasco.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Project Fiasco</a> uses profits to fund pollution solutions so you are helping the environment. </strong>We are currently funding a local women’s NGO in Morocco to plant trees and clean beaches.</p>
<p>And let's be honest, we all could use an elevating book right now. Whether you read the book or contribute to the book, we hope it will be an enriching experience. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>If we reach our goal, we will be able to go ahead and produce the book.

Euronews - This-book-of-love-stories-is-funding-crucial-environmental-work-in-morocco
Yahoo - Project Fiasco Helping the Environment One Love Story at a Time
The Project

Hello, my name is Cynthia Weeks. I am a teacher, children’s book author and founder of the social enterprise Project Fiasco, which has the goal of helping the environment.
We are crowdfunding to add another book to our collection. Our latest project is to collate and publish a book of love-themed short stories from around the world.
Our aim is to produce an uplifting and fun book. We also want to give our backers the opportunity to express themselves and tell their stories of love. We are offering the perk of having your story published in the book. At the same time, as Project Fiasco is a social enterprise focused on the environment, we will use part of the proceeds to fund pollution solutions. Doubly uplifting!
 
What We Need
To proceed with this book, we need at least $2000 AUD. We will use this money to pay for the editing, formatting, cover design, and printing of the book. The funds will also go towards crowdfunding costs such as Indiegogo fees, transaction costs, promotion and, of course the best part: perk fulfilment. We also need your stories! We have been collecting stories from around the globe and we would love more.
 
The Perks
Through this book you will not only have the opportunity to read interesting stories from around the world, but you will also have the option to get your own story published in the book! 
The perk options include:

A Love Note sent to you or someone else by postcard
Your story being published in the book*

An Ebook copy of the book
A paperback edition of the collection
Certificate of Contribution for sharing your story (a great gift idea until the book arrives!)

 
*Love story guidelines:

10-1000 words
You can use your first name, nickname, or alias
Please tell us the location your story. (City or town, and country)
The deadline for submissions is April 15th so you have plenty of time to complete it or time to fall in love and write about it. Good luck either way.
We will have an editor go over the story so do not be too worried about typos

 
The Impact
Project Fiasco uses profits to fund pollution solutions so you are helping the environment. We are currently funding a local women’s NGO in Morocco to plant trees and clean beaches.
And let's be honest, we all could use an elevating book right now. Whether you read the book or contribute to the book, we hope it will be an enriching experience. 
 
Risks & Challenges
If we reach our goal, we will be able to go ahead and produce the book. A challenge that we face is since the many of the stories will be written by backers we cannot fully work on the editing, layout and design of the book until after the campaign is over and the story submission deadline of April 15th has passed. To avoid these timing issues we have given ourselves a generous fulfilment schedule.  
Another challenge that we could have is if stories are not submitted. We anticipated this, and started collecting love stories in advance. We have collected a book's worth of stories, but we want our book to be interactive with our backers so we are excited to offer a place for your stories too.

<h3>Storyline</h3>
<p>Hello, and thanks for stopping by my site. Do you love books about historical fiction? Are you captivated by stories from another era? There's a good chance your are, so don’t go anywhere.</p>
<p>Let me set the scene. It's 1944, the height of the European war. American bomber pilot, Jack Swaggart, finds himself stranded behind enemy lines and teams up with an unlikely ally, Hilde Augsberg, a plucky young German. The pair barely manage to stay one step ahead of Horst Kloster, a relentless Gestapo agent. Jack needs to get back to London and convince the Allies of the looming threat –the Horten bomber.</p>
<p>My book, entitled <i>Stealth</i>, weaves true historical events, about a WWII warplane, the Ho-229, designed and built by two German innovators, Walter and Reimar Horten, with larger-than-life swash-buckling characters in a fictional plot that will leave you clinging to your ripcord.  All of which is sure to make for an exciting read.</p>
<p><i>Stealth</i> has it all: adventure, romance, deception, and twists and turns that will surely keep you strapped in the pilot’s seat, wanting to check out the “logbook” for more. </p>
<p>Jenn Lundy, a talented local artist adept with water colours and acrylics, is creating a cover design. Jenn will come up several sketches, and you will have an opportunity to view and comment on the preliminary drawings.</p>
<p>Do you want to hear more? I’m also setting up a rewards program for those wishing to participate in this venture. Would you like your name listed in the acknowledgements?

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Robert Stermscheg, born in Europe in 1956, was exposed to many wonderful writers – Edgar Rice Burroughs, Alexandre Dumas, Karl May, Agatha Christie, just to name a few. He appreciated how they opened up a whole new world to our imaginations through their portrayal of life.</p>
<p>When Robert retired in 2006, he had the opportunity to devote himself to a new career path – writing fiction; but fiction with a twist. Robert embarked on translating the works of a well-known European author, Karl May, from German into English. No easy feat.</p>
<p>Robert chose one of Karl May’s historical fiction novels, set in 1814 which loosely featured Napoleon Bonaparte, coined <i>The Prussian Lieutenant</i>. It was well received, encouraging him to continue with further translation work. He quickly followed up with the sequel in <i>The Hussar’s Love</i> series, <i>The Marabout’s Secret</i>. Both titles have been published by Word Alive Press.</p>
<p>It was while Robert was immersed in his translation series that he came up with the idea of collaborating with his father, a WWII veteran and a prisoner of war, by writing his memoir. The result was a two year effort that culminated with the finished product, <i>POW #74324</i>. Robert presented the first copy to his father for his 90<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p>
<p>Robert joined a local writers group, giving him the exposure and opportunity to learn from other, established writers and expand his own repertoire. Positive feedback on his writing encouraged him to venture into the devotional and short story realm. To date, several of Robert’s submissions have been featured in the hugely popular <i>Chicken-Soup-for-the-Soul</i> series as well as in David C. Cook’s <i>Power for Living</i> magazine.</p>
<p>Robert resides in Winnipeg, Manitoba. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p>There are always challenges in delivering a finished product, including distribution.  I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of shipping the paperback copies and limited edition prints into each pre-order perk.</p>
<p>The risk of delivering pre-sale copies is contingent on the publisher, the printing service, as well as the delivery method (courier). My publisher, Siretona Creative, is based in Calgary, Alberta and has a good reputation for meeting deadlines and fulfilling their obligations to authors.</p>

Hello, and thanks for stopping by my site. Do you love books about historical fiction? Are you captivated by stories from another era? There's a good chance your are, so don’t go anywhere.
Let me set the scene. It's 1944, the height of the European war. American bomber pilot, Jack Swaggart, finds himself stranded behind enemy lines and teams up with an unlikely ally, Hilde Augsberg, a plucky young German. The pair barely manage to stay one step ahead of Horst Kloster, a relentless Gestapo agent. Jack needs to get back to London and convince the Allies of the looming threat –the Horten bomber.
My book, entitled Stealth, weaves true historical events, about a WWII warplane, the Ho-229, designed and built by two German innovators, Walter and Reimar Horten, with larger-than-life swash-buckling characters in a fictional plot that will leave you clinging to your ripcord.  All of which is sure to make for an exciting read.
Stealth has it all: adventure, romance, deception, and twists and turns that will surely keep you strapped in the pilot’s seat, wanting to check out the “logbook” for more. 
Jenn Lundy, a talented local artist adept with water colours and acrylics, is creating a cover design. Jenn will come up several sketches, and you will have an opportunity to view and comment on the preliminary drawings.
Do you want to hear more? I’m also setting up a rewards program for those wishing to participate in this venture. Would you like your name listed in the acknowledgements? Do you want a limited edition print of the cover? Would you like one of the characters to be named after you? Check back often for updates.

What You Will Get & What We Need
In partnership with Siretona Creative, a Canadian boutique publisher, and me - a local author - you can play an important role in publishing my WWII novel. Choose your reward (perk) and you will enable the project to move forward. Here are the ways your financial investment will move us closer to the goal:

Substantive and Copy-editing of the manuscript. This is an integral part.
The cover design. (The mockups currently on display are temporary). I will update the cover to reflect progress on the design.
Layout and formatting of the paperback and ebook version.
Printing and shipping.
Launch and promotional efforts associated with the campaign.
Production of a limited edition print of the cover.
Once I pre-sell 100 copies of  my book, I will publish the paperback and ebook.
Once I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will publish an audiobook.
I will also be offering some exclusive rewards for those who pre-order the novel.
A personally signed paperback copy.
Your name will appear in the acknowledgements.
Early access to the introduction (beta reading) and select excerpts.
An opportunity to be involved in the selection process of the cover design.

<p>What is feng shui?  Feng shui is a 3,000 year old Chinese practice of how to detect and understand the inner energy of the land and house.  It's the knowledge of how this energy affects and nourishes human life. It's the 3,000 old practice that Asians all over the world rely on to find a home that matches their lifestyle so they can live a fulfilled life.</p>

<p><strong>Who Am I?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Jenny Nakao Hones and I wrote this book because I believe the ancient knowledge of feng shui  can help you on the biggest purchase of your life. I've seen dozens and dozens of families regret their first home purchase and I thought, ""Enough.""  After working as both a professional interior designer and a feng shui consultant for over 10 years and raising 3 boys in 4 different countries, I thought it was time to share what I've learned so you can find your next home, and buy it with confidence. </p>
<p>Now it gets a little frustating because...</p>
<p>Feng shui today gets a bad rap.  And that’s very understandable.  There are many charlatans and marketers who use feng shui to sell their trinkets, ornaments, and good luck charms without any proof of concept.  I too have been fooled and bought knick knacks in hopes of a better life for my family.  </p>
<p><strong>How It All Started:</strong></p>
<p>I first became interested in feng shui because it overlapped with all my interests in homes, spirituality, energy and Asian culture, .  Many books promise good fortune, prosperity, and money.  I wanted that for my family too.  When I heard it had a 3,000 year history of accumulated knowledge, I wanted to know more and wondered how it worked.  </p>
<p>Like most, I first began learning by reading books and searching the internet for more information.  But, the more I read, the more confused I became.  It seemed like one book said one thing, and the next book said something completely different.  I didn’t know how to decipher the information.</p>
<p>On a fateful day, twelve years ago, I met Dr. Shantung Hsu and began my studies of Form School Feng Shui.  There were no trinkets or ornaments.  There was no astrology.  Instead, he taught me how to tap into 3,000 years of ancient Chinese wisdom to live a fulfilled life. Dr. Hsu’s teachings made total sense and I was no longer confused.  I thought, “Why don’t more people have access to this information!!"" The knowledge was practical and actionable. It made a lot of sense, even to my husband. To top it off, it was obvious how much money friends and family would've saved on their homes if they knew these simple feng shui principles.</p> <p><strong>In this book, you will learn</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The origins of feng shui</li>
<li>The core principles of Form School Feng Shui</li>
<li>Why we don’t incorporate astrology and the bagua in our practice </li>
<li>What to look for and avoid in the landscape for good energy</li>
<li>What to look for and avoid for the actual site and house when searching for a house</li>
</ul> <p><strong>You will love this book if you find other feng shui books confusing or contradicting.  </strong></p>
<p>Maybe you’re moving to a bigger house because your family is growing.  Or maybe you have a new job and are moving to a new city.  Some of you may be downsizing after your children have left home.  In all these situations, the book will be a wonderful guide to help you find a good house with a peace of mind.</p> <p><strong>The book is written into two parts.</strong></p>

This solo expedition into truth and understanding would take me through 23 countries and 46 territories; coincidentally, just as many chromosomes in the human genome! It was a fantastic adventure exploring and mapping my human condition and experiencing radical new possibilities here on Earth, and I am excited to share with you the medicine that I am bringing back! </p><p>This journey is for explorers who want to choose a different path and those who have already chosen it. It is for seekers who wish to transcend their struggles and learn how to trust their divine guidance system. Shadowed Soul is a tribute to the struggle of defining oneself, cultivating personal power, and connecting to the worlds in which we live. The reader will have the possibility to explore the depths of their truth as they journey with me across the continents and meet many healers, shamans, visionaries, and of course, shadows. </p><p>My deepest desire is that this story inspires the reader to be the change they wish to see in the world and do it with all of the incredible potential that they possess.</p><h2><strong>Why should you fund this campaign? </strong></h2><p>Do you know someone who needs a little adventure? Perhaps a journey around the world but without all the baggage? Are you curious about what it's like to dance with your subconscious shadows? Are you interested in a bold, courageous, daring experience that will make you laugh, cry, and scream, ""look out!"" Would you like to support a story that is inspiring, honest, authentic, and raw? Then you should fund this campaign! You can support the project in many ways, and they are all appreciated!

There were many posters of world maps and fast cars like Ferraris and Lamborghinis hanging on the walls. A spinning globe stood on the desk and plenty of stuffed animals that I would create stories with hung weightlessly in the netted corners of the room. But I could only remember those things from the photographs left behind. On August 17th, 1995, when I was sixteen years old, I was in a car accident that would take those memories and many more from ""the good years"" of my life away from me for almost two decades. </p><p>Up until my eighth birthday, we moved quite often. It seemed that I had become quite adaptable to the changing of schools, friends, and countries and eagerly anticipated the appearance of large cardboard boxes. Through this moving around, I would become fascinated with the world and curious about every inch of it that I had not yet explored. Then, around the age of twelve, I remember some real drama that began to happen in my childhood. By the time I was almost fifteen, I would have already moved out, got a job to pay my rent and feed myself, and forgotten all about those childish daydreams of world maps, fast cars, and storytelling. I would instead enter the working world in America. The one that was not my dream but helped me survive to be out on my own at such a young age.</p><p>That is until the year 2012, or better known as the end of the world as I knew it. Death and heartbreak would begin to shatter -with heavy, broad, and deliberate strokes, the illusions of my reality. And while experiencing this deterioration of the old, I felt confused, vulnerable, and completely lost. I began to understand depression as it was introduced as my new companion and took up a lot of my space and energy. Is this a spiritual awakening or just a bout of psychosis I wondered?</p><p>The journey into understanding would take me around the world and deep into the folds of my unconscious mind. I decided to turn my compass inward and upward and sought out guides to teach me along the way. What I learned was game-changing and went against most of my knowledge up until the point of those experiences.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608525793/oz2v9cod5kvle0ndi7iy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Little did I know that at the end of those seven years that COVID would thwart my plans to continue traveling, and that is when friends would begin to ask, ""Will you share your story with the world?"" The thought of it terrified me. I had already compiled my diaries into a first draft in 2019 while I sat in the silence of the Sahara Desert. And yet, I really wasn't sure why I had done it. </p><p>And then, as the book started to take form, I realized that I was becoming very apprehensive about sharing it. Sometimes I felt quite confident that it could inspire others. At other times, I felt that exposing these honest and unfiltered experiences would open my heart to unwanted emotional vulnerability. </p><p>This divide brought up a whole new set of shadows that I would need to dance with and took me deep into some genuine (to me) fear.

Metal baseball
bats have been used for more than three decades and have been banned by
thousands of little and youth leagues around the world.



Metal bats
have been used for more than 35 years and, in an irresponsible way, more and
more metal alloys have been developed with lighter and harder materials. This
has resulted in serious accidents, mainly in little and youth leagues, however,
adult categories have not been exempt. 










THE RETURN OF
BASEBALL TO ITS ORIGINS: THE WOOD BAT


The return of the wood baseball bat was not only necessary, but it
also turned into pressing need due to its dangerous background and the possibility
of getting worse sincethe ball may become a
missile when it contacts a metal bat.
















LOOKING FOR
SOLUTIONS

During the
last months, at RHINO BAT CO. we have devoted our time to find a solution to
this serious problem that affects thousands of players of all ages and who are
limited to the use of wood and have been victims of the after-effects of having
used metal bats. 






RHINO
INDESTRUCTIBLE

With the help
of material experts and our experience, we designed a structure made of 16
pieces of wood assembled with ecological glue. Such structure was transformed
in a beautiful solid bat piece called THE INDESTRUCTIBLE and which can resist
up to three to four times the impact of a baseball in comparison with
traditional bats. Its craftsmanship (unique in the industry) with MLB
specifications in its finish certainly solve the damage caused by the use of
metal bats. 





WHAT ARE THE
BENEFITS OF THE INDESTRUCTIBLE?
· 
It promotes discipline which is necessary to bat as a
professional.
· 
It offers the possibility to be a better player. 
· 
It introduces players to real baseball. 
· 
The after-effects caused by the use of metal bats
disappear. 
· 
It helps increase self-esteem.
· 
It gives players confidence and SECURITY. 



RHINO BAT CO. AND
ITS SOCIAL COMMITMENT
Like finding
the cure for a disease, we have faced the challenge of offering a solution by
designing and building THE INDESTRUCTIBLE. We intend to place it in the hands of
professional baseball players of all categories and solve, at the same time,
the problem of cost. Definitely, the cost-benefit of THE INDESTRUCTIBLE is
EXTRAORDINARY.

SPANISHEL BATE DE ALUMINIO ES PELIGROSO!


El Bate de
beisbol metálico, ha sido utilizado por más de tres décadas y ha sido prohibido
por miles de ligas infantiles y juveniles de todo el mundo.






Hace más de 35
años, se está utilizando el bate metálico y de manera irresponsable cada vez se
han creado aleaciones con materiales más ligeros y más duros, esto ha traído
como consecuencia graves accidentes, sobre todo en las ligas infantiles y
juveniles, no quedando exentos de estos problemas, las categorías mayores.





EL REGRESO DEL
BEISBOL A SU ORIGEN: EL BATE DE MADERA


El regreso de la
madera al beisbol, no solo se hizo necesario, sino que se convirtió en una
urgencia por los antecedentes peligrosos y la tendencia a agravarse, al salir
la pelota como un misil, al contacto con un bate metálico.

















BUSCANDO

En RHINO BAT CO. nos
hemos dedicado los últimos meses a buscar y encontrar una solución, para este
grave problema que azota a cientos de miles de jugadores de todas las edades,
al ser limitados a solo la utilización de la madera y ser víctimas de las
secuelas que ha dejado el bate metálico.




RHINO INDESTRUCTIBLE

Nuestra
experiencia y los especialistas en materiales diseñaron una estructura,
compuesta de 16 piezas de madera unidas con un pegamento ecológico, la cual fue
transformada en una bella pieza de batear sólida, misma que soporta hasta  tres y cuatro veces los impactos de una

<div>
<p>In the spring of 1992,
after a jury in Los Angeles acquitted police officers in the beating of Rodney
King, I was sitting on my sister's couch in Atlanta, next to a good friend of
mine who is black. I am white. As we watched neighborhoods in south central LA burn to the
ground, both of us were upset, angry, confused, but for completely different
reasons. In fact, although we were both watching the same images play out in
front of us, it was as if we were watching two entirely different stories. Shocked
and confused by what we were witnessing, I said some things, she said some things, and every word we spoke only widened the divide that was developing between us. The complexity of that
afternoon sparked me to write a one-act play about race and friendship called
Maggie &amp; Drey, which went on the have multiple productions across the
country, including being featured in an off-Broadway theater festival in 2002.
Audiences were rocked by the play. In fact, some people, both black and white,
claimed that the story of Maggie and Drey changed their lives.</p>
<p>One year ago, I decided it was time to develop
Maggie &amp; Drey from a one-act to a two-act, full-length play and to
self produce a legitimate run of it in New York City. I knew I wanted to say
something about racism that hadn't been said before, so I dove head first into
a deep and fearless exploration of race in America. The result of these past
twelve months is a bold yet intimate play that exposes, not the overt
expressions of racial conflict that we see in the headlines, but rather the
little ones, the almost imperceptible ones that seem to occur every day.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Maggie &amp; Drey explores the tangled web of racism through the simple story of two
women, one black, one white, who grew up as best friends and reunite after ten

In the spring of 1992,
after a jury in Los Angeles acquitted police officers in the beating of Rodney
King, I was sitting on my sister's couch in Atlanta, next to a good friend of
mine who is black. I am white. As we watched neighborhoods in south central LA burn to the
ground, both of us were upset, angry, confused, but for completely different
reasons. In fact, although we were both watching the same images play out in
front of us, it was as if we were watching two entirely different stories. Shocked
and confused by what we were witnessing, I said some things, she said some things, and every word we spoke only widened the divide that was developing between us. The complexity of that
afternoon sparked me to write a one-act play about race and friendship called
Maggie & Drey, which went on the have multiple productions across the
country, including being featured in an off-Broadway theater festival in 2002.
Audiences were rocked by the play. In fact, some people, both black and white,
claimed that the story of Maggie and Drey changed their lives.
One year ago, I decided it was time to develop
Maggie & Drey from a one-act to a two-act, full-length play and to
self produce a legitimate run of it in New York City. I knew I wanted to say
something about racism that hadn't been said before, so I dove head first into
a deep and fearless exploration of race in America. The result of these past
twelve months is a bold yet intimate play that exposes, not the overt
expressions of racial conflict that we see in the headlines, but rather the
little ones, the almost imperceptible ones that seem to occur every day.


Maggie & Drey explores the tangled web of racism through the simple story of two
women, one black, one white, who grew up as best friends and reunite after ten
years for their high school reunion. Set inside Drey's Harlem apartment, Maggie & Drey goes directly to the heart, which, after all, is where
racism resides.  
   Where We Are & What We Need

In the true spirit of independent theater, I have used my own resources (aka grocery money) to bring Maggie & Drey to this point. Now I need your help. I have put down a deposit on the PERFECT theater space for a 5-week world premier run of Maggie & Drey from May 1-31, 2015. The Kraine Theater is situated in Manhattan's East Village, between New York Theatre Workshop and La Mama Theater, two of the most legendary spaces for brave and experimental independent theater in America. This two-act version of Maggie and Drey could not have a better place to be born.

 Funding breakdown:   $13,100 Rental Fees for 5-week run at Kraine Theater, NYC. 
$13,600 Compensation for Actors, Director, Crew (stage manager, assistant director) Designers (light, sound, set, wardrobe). 
$5000 Rehearsal and Storage Space.  $2000 Equipment/Prop Rental. 
$3200 Transportation/Lodging. 
$2500 Advertising/Promotional Materials.
 $2000 Unforeseen Expenses. 


Why This Play Matters  

That moment on the couch was 23 years ago, but
it might as well have been today. 
We are standing at a pivotal moment in the
life of America. We truly are a great nation, but until we understand racism, what
it is and how it operates in our everyday lives, that greatness will never
fully flourish. Only art can take us to places that our minds don't know how to
reach, and what art form other than theater for exploring places our hearts are afraid to go. If you have ever experienced or witnessed racial conflict asked yourself ""what can I do?,"" supporting this brave production of Maggie & Drey is one thing you CAN do.

Elizabeth Bast's writing is so compelling, so present! What a gift she is giving the world with her experience and her exquisite writing. It’s the best kind of modern love story: passionate lovers, spiritual awakening, urban addictions, and the rising power of shamanism and plant medicine to help individuals, couples and families step into a new, more enlivened and powerful paradigm of relating.It’s not only a fascinating read, it has the power to be a vehicle of healing for so many. There are so many folks right now on prescription medication or addicted to drugs (or hey, even playing Sudoku) who are seeking relief from suffering. This is the perfect story to get through to them. And also for those who are already more aware, what an amazing reminder of what is possible and how to realign with what we know to be true. I’m so heartened to know that her story offers true solutions to modern ailments and is now available to the world at large. It’s going to grab people and give them a healing just as they read it.""

Two lovers. One shocking drug relapse - after more than a decade clean.Then the disheartening discovery: 90% of narcotics addicts relapse in the first year in our Western Medical system.The lovers navigate the treacherous labyrinth of addiction and ultimately chose to pursue treatment with an obscure indigenous African sacred plant medicine called iboga, used since ancient times for spiritual healing and proven to have powerful addiction breaking effects. It sounds too good to be true, but it's seems to be worth the try, considering the alternatives.This medicine is only available well beyond the borders of the United States. There is hope for healing, if they can both make it to the shaman in time.

<p>My name is Connie Flynn. I write fiction, mostly novels, and teach others how to  write it. I have been busy at it for over twenty years and have written sixteen novels, twelve of them published. I've also written three published short stories. This campaign is about turning a book of mine into a runaway bestseller. Sounds cool, huh? But let's go the beginning . . . if you have time.</p>
<p>My earliest writing memory was of a series of mysteries I wrote for Mr. Ryan's fourth grade class at Isaac Elementary School. The stories
followed the adventures of a brother/sister team who solved mysteries, particularly 
around Halloween, where they spent way too much time counting white hairs
 on black cats who'd applied to be on their witch/wizard team. My classmates loved these stories and so did I. Somehow, at that early age, I'd connected with my true calling.<br/></p>But life got in the way. I grew up, I got married. I had children (who are the joy of my life). I gave up my calling. After all, it took years to get a novel published, if it ever even happened, and I needed a real job.<br/><br/>Several decades later I published my first novel with Harlequin and wrote five more for them. I then went on to write four supernatural romantic thrillers for Penguin/Putnam. (See my book list further down.) Then life got in the way again. A disruptive injury, a divorce, a move to a new house and a need to earn a regular paycheck. I needed a day job.<br/><br/>Another decade later, I was ready to go back to full time writing. In an entirely <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437439625/ibh08tf7em086fzosddv.png"" src="""" style=""width: 159.128px; height: 321px; float: right;""/>different publishing world.

</div></div>","How I Got Here . . .
My name is Connie Flynn. I write fiction, mostly novels, and teach others how to  write it. I have been busy at it for over twenty years and have written sixteen novels, twelve of them published. I've also written three published short stories. This campaign is about turning a book of mine into a runaway bestseller. Sounds cool, huh? But let's go the beginning . . . if you have time.
My earliest writing memory was of a series of mysteries I wrote for Mr. Ryan's fourth grade class at Isaac Elementary School. The stories
followed the adventures of a brother/sister team who solved mysteries, particularly 
around Halloween, where they spent way too much time counting white hairs
 on black cats who'd applied to be on their witch/wizard team. My classmates loved these stories and so did I. Somehow, at that early age, I'd connected with my true calling.But life got in the way. I grew up, I got married. I had children (who are the joy of my life). I gave up my calling. After all, it took years to get a novel published, if it ever even happened, and I needed a real job.Several decades later I published my first novel with Harlequin and wrote five more for them. I then went on to write four supernatural romantic thrillers for Penguin/Putnam. (See my book list further down.) Then life got in the way again. A disruptive injury, a divorce, a move to a new house and a need to earn a regular paycheck. I needed a day job.Another decade later, I was ready to go back to full time writing. In an entirely different publishing world. When I left there were over thirty independent publishing houses. By the time I returned to writing, there were no more than seven. By this time my calling to write was howling. No matter what, I was going to get and stay published. I joined the growing ranks of independent authors. I got back rights to my previous books and reissued four of them. I wrote two new books (See Know When to Run above) and have four unfinished manuscripts to complete.The demands of this calling are staggering. Although I published the two new books, and converted four earlier books, I still have six left to prep for reissue. There are three million books listed on Amazon and thousands being sold through smaller distributors and independent websites. I have to promote at least two hours a day or lose sales and advertising continues to get more expensive. Generating enough income to pay my bills has become a struggle. But to stay on top, much less get ahead, I need to outsource some of the work I'm now doing.There's a business axiom that says that whatever you did to get to your current level of success won't take you to the next level. I've found that axiom to be true. My time and income is limited, my competition fierce. My team consists of family members, who have their own lives to live. I can't do what needs to be done, not alone. Which is why I'm asking for help.   What We Need & What You Get  Connie and her team are aiming for $4000 in contributions to cover the following publishing expenses:

$2000 for advertising
$1200 to prepare remaining backlist for publishing

$500 to cover cost of delivering perks and pay taxes

$300 for upgraded software

<p>The Kitten Calendar: How I Found My Inner Bettie Page (And
So Much More)</p>
<p>In 2012, married to a lady, recently polyamorous, and
utterly befuddled by men, I sent myself on a series of body adventures. My goal
was to find confidence, but I found something so much deeper: life-altering
healing and self-acceptance. I shed my inhibitions (and often my clothes) and went
deep into the overlapping worlds of polyamory, BDSM, and nudism and discovered
what it’s really like there—the characters, the struggles, the ecstasies and joys.
Though I went looking for (and sometimes found) a magical land of liberated
acceptance, I also wrestled with rape culture and eroding definitions of
responsibility and consent. (And sometimes I won!)</p>
<p>In this time of <i>Fifty
Shades of Grey</i>, I think it’s important to tell this sex-positive,
empowering story of what it really means to transgress and transcend sexual
boundaries, to experience the thrills of objectification while at the same time
expressing and celebrating personhood.</p>
<p>Writer and activist Jaclyn Friedman said “The cure for
sexualization is sex,” and as right and happy as that idea is, I think that the
cure for sexualization is connection. By opening up and bringing my specific
point of view to a mainstream audience, I would like to humanize and give voice
to the submissive female, break down stereotypes, and form a real connection. The
more we can all be perceived as individual and real, the better chance we have
of truly liberating ourselves.</p>
<p>I blogged my adventures at <a href=""kittencalendar.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">kittencalendar.blogspot.com</a>, but
I need the time to comb through the content, convert it into book form, and
find a publisher. That’s where you come in. I am asking for $6,000 to help
cover four months’ living expenses so that I can devote myself to the book full
time.</p>
<p>If this project seems like something you can get behind,
please pass this link along and/or donate. I promise to do my darndest to make
it worth your while.</p>

<p><a href=""www.swhd.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Easter Seals Southwest Human Development</a> is a
nonprofit organization in Arizona dedicated to serving young children
ages birth to 5 years old. One of the ways we do this is the distribution

<p>We distribute these books in low-income communities where there is only 1 book per 300 kids, compared to 13 books

We will distribute at least 2,000 of the books we publish to the children we serve.

<p>This is a social venture and we need your help to raise $10,000

<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>By publishing our own book, we will
be able to keep our costs low, engage with people who love literature and create
a new revenue stream to fund early literacy initiatives in the future. But most importantly, we are going to be putting the
books into the hands of children who live in low-income neighborhoods. <br/></p><p>So, how do we do it?</p>
<ul>
<li>We distribute books through our <i><a href=""www.swhd.org/ror"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Reach Out and Read</a></i>
     program which is a partnership with pediatric clinics where a book is incorporated into the doctor's exam during each well child check-up. Plus, the child gets to keep the book to start his or her own home library!<br/>
</li>
<li>We use books to support early literacy and language development

You can find contest details at the First Edition Children's Book Writing Contest website. We'll be selling this book in local and online book sellers, and for every book we sell, we will give one to a child in need, similar to the Tom's shoes model. We will distribute at least 2,000 of the books we publish to the children we serve. This social venture needs your help!  Since we are a nonprofit, this $10,000 campaign will help fund our initial costs of making the next great children's book a reality!                 
What We Need & Why
This is a social venture and we need your help to raise $10,000
in order to hire an illustrator, copy editor and layout
expert for our book. As a nonprofit,
we cannot spend money until we make money!


The
Impact
By publishing our own book, we will
be able to keep our costs low, engage with people who love literature and create
a new revenue stream to fund early literacy initiatives in the future. But most importantly, we are going to be putting the
books into the hands of children who live in low-income neighborhoods. So, how do we do it?

We distribute books through our Reach Out and Read
     program which is a partnership with pediatric clinics where a book is incorporated into the doctor's exam during each well child check-up. Plus, the child gets to keep the book to start his or her own home library!

We use books to support early literacy and language development
     through our Raising A Reader eight-week workshop series for young children and
     their parents at low-income apartment communities and community centers.
We WILL close the book gap between kids being raised in low-income
     neighborhoods and those in middle and upper income communities!

Are There Risks?

This is a social venture that
incorporates a business approach, so yeah, there are risks. But we think there is a Dr. Seuss out there
who just hasn’t been found yet!  Why are we
confident that we can make this happen?

We’ve got an amazing team of professionals to help us with the edit and
     layout process.  

Our selection committee includes many literacy experts and
     diverse experiences that will ensure that we find a great manuscript!
We’re not afraid to ask for help and - fortunately for
     us - our business community and entrepreneurs are eagerly stepping up to help!

Other
Ways You Can Help
We understand that some people just
can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help!

Help us spread the word! Do you have a friend that
     likes to write? Maybe they’d like
     to submit a manuscript. Ask them to
     go to www.firsteditionproject.com for details.

<p>“When they started getting letters from the governor’s office, former governors, prominent individuals, they realized that they had messed with the wrong black family.” -- Adam P. Kennedy, on the Arlington district attorney’s office after he was beaten by police</p>
<p>I’m Canaan Kennedy, 17 years old. I’ve written a book about racism in America and my family’s history of not only overcoming great adversity, but of cutting a path forward. I’m asking for your help with self-publication so that I can add my story—and my family’s story—to the canon of African American literature.</p>
<p>Who am I, and where am I going?</p>
<p>I’m the son of Adam P. Kennedy and Renee Kennedy. I am the grandson of Dr. Joseph Kennedy and Adrienne Kennedy. I’m also at a crossroads in my life, in the process of moving from teenager to man, in particular, a man of color in 21st century America. Having grown up mixed-race in an all-white community, I’m coming to grips with continued racism in this country and the events in Ferguson, Missouri and New York. Above all else, I’m understanding, appreciating, and integrating the power of my family’s history.</p>
<p>What happened to Michael Brown and Eric Garner are not isolated incidents. They’re all part of a long history of struggles, several steps forward for every step back, and I’m finding one thing of great importance: for every story of struggle, there are more of victory. My family is full of such stories. What challenges did we face? How did we successfully beat the odds? How did we prevail? Why can’t these positive stories trump the media stereotypes? What does it mean to be middle class, educated, and black in America?</p>
<p>These are all things I explore and present in my book, through interviews conducted with my family members and my own observations of how this has informed and will inform who I am. It’s my hope that these stories will serve a larger narrative of struggles leading to victory.</p>

To make matters worse, my father was then charged with assaulting a police officer. Not only did he survive this attack; he was acquitted of all charges, won a civil suit against Arlington County, forced the Arlington County Police Department to stop using racially biased teaching manuals, co-wrote a play about the incident with my grandmother, and won the 1996 Obie Award for Best New American Play, Sleep Deprivation Chamber.

<p>Adrienne Kennedy has been a force in American theatre since the early 1960s, influencing generations of playwrights with her hauntingly fragmentary lyrical dramas. She was a key figure of the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which included (among others) Amiri Baraka, Nikki Giovanni, Lorraine Hansberry, and Maya Angelou. She is a three-time Obie-award winning playwright, including Funnyhouse of a Negro in 1964, June and Jean in Concertin 1996, and Sleep Deprivation Chamber in 1996. Among Kennedy's many honors are the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award, the Guggenheim Fellowship, and the 2003 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Lifetime Achievement. She was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the Theatre for a New Audience. Kennedy was also honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2008 Obies. She has been commissioned to write works for the Public Theater, Jerome Robbins, the Royal Court Theatre, the Mark Taper Forum, and Juilliard. In 1995-1996, the Signature Theatre Company dedicated its entire season to presenting her works. She became an honorary member of the Modern Language Association in 2005, and her work appears in the Norton Anthology of American Literature.</p>
<p>As a young girl she voraciously read books. Despite facing racism during her undergraduate years at The Ohio State University, she went on to experience not only her plays winning awards, but also being taught in universities all over the world. Kennedy has been a visiting professor at Yale University, Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley, and she ended her teaching career at Harvard University. Kennedy received an honorary doctorate from The Ohio State University in 2003 in recognition of the 50th anniversary of her graduation.</p>

“When they started getting letters from the governor’s office, former governors, prominent individuals, they realized that they had messed with the wrong black family.” -- Adam P. Kennedy, on the Arlington district attorney’s office after he was beaten by police
I’m Canaan Kennedy, 17 years old. I’ve written a book about racism in America and my family’s history of not only overcoming great adversity, but of cutting a path forward. I’m asking for your help with self-publication so that I can add my story—and my family’s story—to the canon of African American literature.
Who am I, and where am I going?
I’m the son of Adam P. Kennedy and Renee Kennedy. I am the grandson of Dr. Joseph Kennedy and Adrienne Kennedy. I’m also at a crossroads in my life, in the process of moving from teenager to man, in particular, a man of color in 21st century America. Having grown up mixed-race in an all-white community, I’m coming to grips with continued racism in this country and the events in Ferguson, Missouri and New York. Above all else, I’m understanding, appreciating, and integrating the power of my family’s history.
What happened to Michael Brown and Eric Garner are not isolated incidents. They’re all part of a long history of struggles, several steps forward for every step back, and I’m finding one thing of great importance: for every story of struggle, there are more of victory. My family is full of such stories. What challenges did we face? How did we successfully beat the odds? How did we prevail? Why can’t these positive stories trump the media stereotypes? What does it mean to be middle class, educated, and black in America?
These are all things I explore and present in my book, through interviews conducted with my family members and my own observations of how this has informed and will inform who I am. It’s my hope that these stories will serve a larger narrative of struggles leading to victory.

Among Kennedy's many honors are the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award, the Guggenheim Fellowship, and the 2003 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Lifetime Achievement. She was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the Theatre for a New Audience. Kennedy was also honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2008 Obies. She has been commissioned to write works for the Public Theater, Jerome Robbins, the Royal Court Theatre, the Mark Taper Forum, and Juilliard. In 1995-1996, the Signature Theatre Company dedicated its entire season to presenting her works. She became an honorary member of the Modern Language Association in 2005, and her work appears in the Norton Anthology of American Literature.
As a young girl she voraciously read books. Despite facing racism during her undergraduate years at The Ohio State University, she went on to experience not only her plays winning awards, but also being taught in universities all over the world. Kennedy has been a visiting professor at Yale University, Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley, and she ended her teaching career at Harvard University. Kennedy received an honorary doctorate from The Ohio State University in 2003 in recognition of the 50th anniversary of her graduation.
My grandfather
Dr. Joseph Kennedy and Nelson Mandela
Dr. Joseph Kennedy was only the second black American to get a PhD in social psychology from Columbia University when he graduated in 1958. He was a professor of psychology at Hunter College of CUNY and Prairie View A&M College in Texas.
One of six children growing up in a mostly white Ohio community, his mother and father encouraged him to dream. Because of his parents’ teachings on Africa he developed a deep interest, traveling there with his own family in the early 1960s. He was the first black American to be Peace Corps Director for the East Asia and Pacific Region.
In 1971, he co-founded Africare, a leading non-governmental organization (NGO) committed to improving the quality of life of the people in Africa and strengthening relations between American blacks and Africans. His writings on Africa and African development have appeared in the New York Times Magazine and Washington Post. He has traveled to 100 countries.

<br/>
<p>My name is Matthew Pauly.  I am Canadian.  I earned a
B.A. in Sociology and Computer Studies and have been working in my field
successfully for 26 years until recently.  My parents were American. 
I was baptized an Anglican, and raised a Unitarian.  I became a Buddhist
(and thus Vegetarian) in 2010 after a near death experience involving this true
story.  My father was a Cultural
Anthropologist and Sociologist; I was taught to non-violently fight for
equality, social justice and especially for the rights of North American
Indians.  I have no criminal record. </p>
<p>I have been married to a wonderful woman from China for the past
thirteen years.  Our son is in university.  My wife reports that what
our family has been through in the past ten years with all the shock, raw fear,
and illness far eclipses what she experienced growing up in a top targeted
family in The Peoples Republic of China during Mao's Cultural
Revolution. </p>
<p>I am a non-consensual, MKULTRA Monarch mind-control “sleeper
assassin” test subject, and non-consensual chemical weapons tester.  I was chosen in
part because the US Joint Task Force (JTF,) and Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(RCMP) knew I had suffered severe Psychological Trauma as a child which means under torture I dissociate quicker than most.  To dissociate means the dominant personality goes to sleep to protect itself.  In 1940 it was announced in The Ottawa Citizen that the RCMP were partnering with the OSS (CIA precursor) in a project to develop ""better assassins."" </p>
<p>Once
dissociated, resisting hypnosis is very difficult, and dissociative amnesia starts immediately after the event so the victim is handicapped in gathering evidence like seeking medical attention or calling the police.  After the dissociation event they have 'missing time' for from months to years.  The anonymous handler is never fingered for the crime.  My first non-consensual training event was a 2005 JTF--&gt;JTF2 (Joint Task Force Two is Canadian) training exercise titled “Joint-Control, Unified Command 2005” (JC UC ’05), with RCMP support. In that event my X-handler Mitch (JTF) asked about of my childhood.  I told him of some of the traumas.  He responded, “Yes, I know.  We look far and wide for people like you
Matthew.”</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>All three Canadian military officers in the event made penance to me personally during or after the event.  It was clear the drugging, torture (electricity, physical assaults, and worse,) hypnosis, and forced confession (by RCMP) sickened them. They also stopped the JTF officer from taking me off to Pearson International Airport where he had a jet waiting to take me to Guantanamo Bay.  They knew I was no terrorist as all I had admitted was that I would defend my country if invaded. </p>
<p>For a graphic idea of what this whistleblowing book is about, have
a quick view of this “American ULTRA” movie trailer that although a comedy (for
mass appeal), contains accurate depictions of how a sleeper assassin or super-soldier
can be triggered with only a few words. 
Note the lead character says he wonders if he is a robot, i.e.
programmed.  What's not in the trailer is the repeated torture and hypnosis needed to create a sleeper assassin, and for a super-soldier years of this and additionally military training.</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This book project has taken ten years of my life, and its so
close to completion, I can feel the power of this </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">endeavour</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.  I have been
contacted by over a half dozen MKULTRA test-subjects in the past year alone
including a super-soldier.  I have video-conferenced with several of them;
they were all authentic.  They told me its important that I write this
book; they do not have the resources, and support to do so.  They are suffering profoundly, but
this book gives them hope.</span></p>
<p>I owe it to all non-consensual test subjects to whistle blow
this massive abuse of human rights, and Geneva conventions.  These torture-conditioned, Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) suffering, hypnotically-programmed victims are employed like human robots, without consent, and this is human trafficking. These victims are used as:</p>
<p>    i)  Assassins</p>
<p>    ii) Actors in manufactured terror events (mass murders) to manipulate the public to tolerate rights reducing laws and policies favouring covert, powerful groups within the political-security apparatus</p>
<p>    iii) Information couriers</p>
<p>    iv) Sex slaves to entrap politicians and persons of interest for intelligence gathering and blackmail</p>
<p>     v) Spies</p>
<p>    vi) Patsies to take blame for assassinations and manufactured terror events</p>
<p>   vii) Chemical, Biological and Radiological lethal weapons testers</p>
<p>I owe it to the 6,000 North American Indian, Canadian children who mysteriously died while in government mandated, religious Residential Schools over a forty year period, where most were physically, sexually and even torture abused.  My contacts in the American Indian Movement report that children were taken in groups of two or three to the Infirmary during the day. The next morning it would be announced they died.  Closed (empty) coffins would publicly be buried.  </p>
<p>Some of the other children awoke in the night and heard American-accented officials take the Infirmary children away.  These CIA or military MKULTRA program officials would have been introduced to the school administration by the RCMP, otherwise they would not have been trusted.  All of these children were used for MKULTRA experiments, and would have been eventually killed in lethal weapons tests. Some have survived in the USA to tell of this story.  I owe it to them to expose this non-consensual human experimentation.</p>
<p>
At a recent place of
refuge, I have wiped tears from another victim’s cheek, and hugged them close. They cried and thanked me.  They have been used as a non-consensual
information courier, through torture-trauma dissociation and hypnosis, and remain
haunted from the terrible sexual and physical abuse (torture) they suffered as
a child, and as an adult.</p>
<p>Your contribution will make a significant impact in stopping
human suffering, and stopping the abuse of our democracies through manufactured
terror events.</p>

<h2>Establishing Credibility</h2>
</b><p></p>
<h3><b>1. Insider Information: How to spot a
sleeper assassin</b></h3>
<p> I will share here all I know about detecting signs of a mind-controlled, ‘sleeper assassin’.  This is useful for analyzing video of actors in terror events, and their court appearances.  All of the signs I am relating are based on my real world experience as a non-consensual, mind-controlled ‘sleeper assassin’ test subject of Mitch (JTF) operating out of the US Consulate in Toronto until recently, and assisted by the RCMP. </p>
<p>1. High-dosage Scopolamine is required to
remove free will in the subject. The signs of Scopolamine impairment:</p>
<p>    a.<span> 
</span>Dilated pupils</p>
<p>    b.<span> 
</span>Droopy eyelids: The upper
eyelid rests lower on the eye than normal, almost obscuring the top part of the
pupil</p>
<p>    c.<span> 
</span>Slow blinking: Eyelid blinking
is slower than normal</p>
<p>    d.<span> 
</span>Very foul bad breath:
Scopolamine clearing in the body causes foul gases to be released by the lungs,
thus the Columbian First Peoples name for it: “Devil’s
Breath”</p>
<p>    e.<span> 
</span>Heavy legs: loss of strength in
the legs requiring extra will power just to stand up right, walk, and run</p>
<p>    f.<span> 
</span>Heavy head: The subject may
have trouble keeping their head held up straight, e.g. they might be “bobbing”
their head while seated</p>
<p>    g.<span> 
</span>Loss of willpower: subject will
do virtually whatever they are told with no resistance, including acts of
violence especially when combined with torture-trauma dissociation and hypnosis</p>
<p>    h.<span> 
</span>Post-event amnesia: Scopolamine
intoxication causes amnesia for 3 to 5 days following the time period
the person was intoxicated (will be at least several hours.)  Usually a subject is torture-trauma
dissociated concurrently, which in itself causes amnesia for usually months to many
years</p>
<p>2. After the Scopolamine intoxication is combined
with torture-trauma to cause dissociation, finally the subject is put in a
hypnotic trance.  Signs of a hypnotic
trance:</p>
<p>    a.<span> 
</span>‘Clear Eyes’ is the
intelligence community code for an active sleeper.  The subject’s eyes are vacant, and staring
blankly</p>
<p>    b.<span> 
</span>There are abrupt changes in
behavior when previously programmed triggers 
(through hypnosis) are present. 
Triggers can include hearing a person’s name, or a sentence spoken to
them, or even a non-verbal signal.  These triggers can even be
effectively delivered by a phone call, made from a blocked or faked number of
course.  This last point is just a repeat
of declassified MKULTRA CIA documents, see <a href=""http://wanttoknow.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CIA Mind Control: Declassified Documents</a></p>
<h3>2. Supportive Medical Documentation</h3>
<p>In late 2005 I was diagnosed with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD.)  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I have had over 500 hours of therapy from both a Psychiatrist
specializing in Psychological Trauma, and a Psychodynamic Psychotherapist with forty
years experience (over $25,000 CAD spent.)   I was nearly healed until career interference in 2011-12-13, and
then resumption of non-consensual tests in 2014. </span></p>
<p>Below is a letter that
attests a Psychiatrist specializing in Psychological Trauma (PTSD) at first had concerns that my claim of the 2005 torture-interrogation, and mind-control event might be false but after many years of
extensive therapy and drug trials, he could not find a delusional illness.  He now heads a Psychiatric
department at a hospital that is close to a Canadian Air Force base. His team has successfully treated hundreds of PTSD-suffering soldiers from the war in
Afghanistan.  Many more such professional teams are needed.</p>
<p>UPDATE OCT-18-2015: Removed letter image.  The doctor did not agree to my posting the letter on the Internet.  I have permission to include it in my book.  Below is a two paragraph excerpt from the letter.</p>
<p>=========================================</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Since his initial presentation he has had trials of three different antipsychotic medications due to my concerns that these memories may be false.  This includes a trial clozapine, well known to be an antipsychotic with superior efficacy.  He retains full memory of the events in question despite these trials.  He has not been diagnosed with a Delusional Disorder.</span><br/></p>
<p>He has never presented with suicidal ideations, intentions, or plans.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">========================================</span><br/></p>
</div> <div>
<h3>3.  Credible Co-Author Joins Project</h3>
<p>I have teamed up with Ann Diamond who has published several
books about her survival as a child from non-consensual, mind-control experiments of Dr.
Ewen Cameron (CIA funded) in McGill Victoria Hospital, and the Allan Memorial
Institute in Montreal in the 1950s. </p>
<p>I
have read Ann's “A Certain Girl” and was riveted. The more complete “My Cold War” remains the definitive
book on this era of mind-control experimentation in Canada, and is used in post-secondary courses.  </p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need
and Community Benefit</h2>
</div>
<p>My family and I
need a security presence for the two months needed to complete this whistle blower
book. There are two outstanding death threats, one of which is credible as it was delivered in person to me at my house by two members of the Israeli Special Operations and Intelligence, Mossad on July 15, 2015.  </p><p>The US security apparatus (JTF or other) might take termination action, given they attempted murder in an MKULTRA fatal weapons test on June 21, 2014, and again on June 4, 2015. This last one was a very close call.</p>
<p>Since I have been unable to work for 2.5 years due to PTSD symptoms, we borrowed money to buy a burglar alarm system, and surveillance cameras.  This consumer-grade burglar alarm system and cameras are child’s play to Special
Forces and intelligence agencies.</p><p>A security expert in 2014 performed a threat assessment on our situation, during an hour long interview.  He said there is no question we need to move into a 'Safe House' immediately, and it would cost about $20,000 per month.  We thought that was too expensive and perhaps not warranted.</p><p>Now we realize that he was right.  If we don't raise enough money for a safe house, then at least we would hope to raise enough to have 24X7 guard(s) until the book is published.  </p><p></p><h3>Security Threats We Experienced in the Last Year</h3><p>Most readers will be shocked, and even in disbelief upon reading below what experiments have been done on my family and I in the past year -- why would government security forces do such heinous experiments on civilians?  Please view this video which depicts a hypnosis-only created assassin, and how dangerous that hypnotically programmed person became, and how they suffered amnesia after the event thus providing ""Plausible Deniability"" to the controller in a real situation. This will give you an idea why security forces are willing to commit such crimes against humanity to perfect the art of mind-control.  Power is a drug.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FwipVDW3Vc4A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DwipVDW3Vc4A&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FwipVDW3Vc4A%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><h4>1. 14-06-21 - Chemical Weapons Test: Fog Delivery of Scopolamine Aerosol</h4><p>I narrowly survived
a near-fatal weapons test on Montgomery Avenue in Toronto at 7:00 AM.  I was drawn into the trap by Mitch talking through a Voice-to-Skull (V2K) transmitter that drew me to investigate the source of the sound.  He used the microwave sourced voice transmission to lure me to the only secluded place on my block.  Then he executed a perfect military roll into crouching position from behind a fake bush mounted on a board adjacent to a parking lot.  He stood and was dressed in black, with a  gas mask, holding a black hose with a nozzle resembling that found on a fire extinguisher that emanated a white fog.  </p><p>Fog blasted all around me forming a cloud as he stepped over the fake bush, which briefly caught his boot.  I held my breath and was stunned.  As the flog settled to below my eye level, I recognized him by his body shape, and voice when he stepped back from the fog.  I said sarcastically ""Thanks!"".  He pulled off the gas mask and responded  ""Anytime <i>Matthew</i>!"" with heavy emphasis on my name, dripping with contempt.  My eyes, nose, lips and throat burned and I turned to run.  My legs became very heavy immediately; I recognized it was Scopolamine from its use in the 2007 event (in book.)</p><p>I managed to run to the most public piece of grass about twenty feet away before collapsing unable to breathe.  I stopped breathing and went
unconscious three times.  Our family
Golden Retriever Cody was mortally injured in that event for the crime of licking my lips and nose to revive me once as I lay unconscious, not breathing and helpless on the grass.  He did exactly as a mother dog does to her puppies at birth, and he revived me once before he was injured.</p><p>The US JTF mortally injured a Golden Retriever because he was interfering with their fatal-weapons test. Below is a
photo of our shrine to Cody, on the shelf that used to contain the microwave that Mitch (JTF) sabotaged  as part of another MKULTRA experiment. (see 3. g. below) </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438665510/y2jisvwvlwbo1mzdnfdh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h4>2. 14-07-09 Fatal Weapons Test Trap</h4><p>Once I recovered the trauma-dissociated memory of the June 4, 2014 Chemical Weapons test, I was shocked and degraded to have been gassed on Canadian soil, by Special Forces of our closest ally, a country my parents were born in.  I could have had American citizenship at 18 but I declined.  My American lineage goes back to 1630 when the ""John and Mary"" arrived from Scotland, where my ancestor John P. came from the lowlands. </p><p>Being gassed injured my dignity deeply and I felt I needed to do some symbolic act to regain it.</p><p>On July 9, 2014 I performed twenty minutes of
street theatre by playing loud rock music in my car with windows down while
parked across the street from the back entrance of the US Consulate.   A security guard pointed me out to another guard, and one of them went inside, likely to call the police.  In fifteen minutes in two marked police cars drove slowly by but did not talk to me even though I was parked at a stop sign. I drove
home about five minutes later. Then the US JTF promptly sent two
watchers to Montgomery Avenue in different cars.  I walked towards them with a
walking stick (legal) and they fled. </p>
<p>One
hour later, an assassin trap (fatal weapons test) was set on Montgomery Avenue
featuring a new JTF actor with a poison marker pen in a red car.  I sensed danger and avoided the trap. It
turns out puffing one’s chest at Godzilla is not such a good idea.  </p><p>The athletic looking man with a professional calm but serious demeanour in the red car in the video below leaves his passengers side window all the way down, tempting me to poke my walking stick inside (which I would never do.) He would have grabbed and pulled the stick in, and with my arm within reach he would have swiped the poison marker pen on my skin.  [Mitch (JTF) in the January 2015 home invasion said: ""You figured all that out huh?""]  I put the video up on Facebook.  </p><p>Click the link below, then press the HD button at the bottom right of the video page.  Notice as I walk by the man in the red car raises his arms to protect his head, and to be ready to grab the stick if it was poked in, with the poison laden marker held in his teeth cap end first for a quick draw (there is no paper visible.)  He lowers his arms once I pass by.  Later that evening he jogged back and forth on our side of the block in the pouring rain for a full hour, soaked, holding up an umbrella anyway, just to demonstrate his athleticism and to intimidate.</p><div></div><div data-allowfullscreen=""1"" data-href=""/matthew.pauley99/videos/627035507411342/""><div><blockquote cite=""https://www.facebook.com/matthew.pauley99/videos/627035507411342/"">

</p><p>    a.<span>  </span>Administration of a noxious substance: Scopolamine aerosol from
a spray can as I lay sleeping in my bed after my wife left for work</p>
<p>    b.<span>  </span>Torture with elbow hyperextension to cause dissociation while kneeling on my back</p>
<p>    c.<span>  </span>Non-consensual hypnosis, with forced repeat of
post-hypnotic suggestions</p>
<p>    d.<span>  </span>Rape and death threat (it turns out Mitch is Gay.) This started with him asking me to turn over onto my back in bed, as he knew all about my martial arts training and wanted to inspect my physique. ""Turn over Matthew, I want to take a look at you.  But before you do, instead of seeing my face, you're only going to only see a black region where my face is. You will not see or be able to remember my face.""  I turned over. ""Wow, you're a lot bigger than the last time I saw you!"" he said as he saw the muscle development from my training.  I will spare you the details of what happened after he asked me to turn back over.  Afterwards he said, ""You know if you tell anyone I will kill you, right?""</p>
<p>    e.<span>  </span>Interrogation, in particular to determine if the leader of my Russian Martial Art school had turned me into a ""double sleeper agent.""  Over and over again he asked ""Come on Matthew, is there a Russian accented controller in there.""  There was lots of torture.  There was no Russian controller, as first the instructor is now Canadian, and second he would never risk destroying his business by getting involved in covert activities.</p><p>    f.  Gun held to my head.   During the interrogation Mitch (JTF) asked what I meant in a Facebook posting when I wrote ""Next time he tries to pick me up it will get messy.""  He asked ""Do you have a knife Matthew?""  ""No,"" I replied.  ""Come on Matthew, do you have any knives?"" he asked over and over while using torture. ""There are knives in the kitchen,"" I replied.  ""Then what did you mean by that statement?"" Mitch asked.  I replied, ""I meant I would resist.""  A moment passed and I realized even dissociated, that I promised myself that I would resist, I remembered my martial arts study.  Suddenly I started violently rocking him off my back.  In about two seconds I felt a blunt hard object pressed against my skull. I froze.  ""Do you know what this is Matthew?"" he asked in a serious tone.  ""Yes, its all shiny,"" I replied remembering him pulling out his all chromed handgun in the 2005 event.  ""That's right, you remember!"" he said angrily.  ""I ought to blow you away right now,"" he added in anger.  There were a few terrifying moments of silence as he decided his next move. Then he got off me, and I heard a ""click"" (safety on.)  At first I thought it was the trigger but then realized the bullet would be in my brain before I heard the click of the trigger.  Then I heard the ""SSSHHHHHHHH"" sound of the spray can of Scopolamine behind me.  I called out, ""You Bastard!"" not knowing if I would ever wake up.</p>
<p>    g.<span>  </span>Sabotaged our microwave oven as part of a mind-control
experiment to see how long a test subject could be mind-controlled to not
remember a health threat to his family. He led me (in dissociated Beta alter) to the microwave and demanded I watch as he pulled out a pen-knife and carefully peeled up a corner of the polycarbonate film on the door inside glass, and peeled it all off in one piece.  I protested but he repeated twice ""trust me, you don't need this.""  Then he made me repeat about ten times ""I will not remember this, I will not remember this, etc.""  It took six months for the mind-control to wear off.  My wife is slightly impatient and stands in front of the microwave waiting for it to finish. She is the one who got the high-dose of microwaves. Without that film, much more microwaves leak from the oven.  I bought a good RF meter and measured a 500% increase compared to a neighbour's microwave with film intact, same brand, same wattage.  </p>

Forced repeating (about 10 times) of a post-hypnotic suggestion ""When I hear the air horn sounded twice below my bedroom window, I will strangle my wife for 10 seconds, and then let her go.""   Mitch (JTF) asked me to listen as he sounded the hand-held airhorn once so I would know the timbre and pitch.  Within two weeks, in the middle of the night he sounded the airhorn twice below my bedroom window.  Upon barely grasping my wife's neck with one hand while in a hypnotic trance, my wife shouted ""Matthew!!"" and I stopped, and fell back asleep.  She told me what happened in the morning.  Its clear the intent of this was not just an MKULTRA experiment, but to establish a pattern of homicidal violence so useful in a last resort, staged murder-suicide to silence this whistle blower, and take out his family as collateral damage.</p><p>    j.

Jewish friends, what they did for a living, and after skipping the lawyer, and
newspaper columnist, he focused in on the activist, the chair of the resident’s
association board I sit on.  He asked if
his spouse was Jewish (they are.)  He
asked how to spell their names, and where they lived. (Clearly his Nazi grandfather indoctrinated him in Nazism when he torture-conditioning Mitch from five years old.)</p><h4>5.<span>  </span>15-06-24 - Fatal chemical weapons test</h4>
<p>    a.<span>  </span>Mitch (JTF) walked south on Edith drive at about 3:30 PM, on the East side only two blocks from my house. He was in high-end, very convincing ‘drag’ with an
identifying large hole below his left knee, and same haircut and colour, while swinging a very large purse looped over his left shoulder, and open
at the top. He had professional makeup, large tinted glasses, gold necklaces, sequins on his bright coloured jacket, and tight, faded to white bluejeans. He gave a movie-worthy performance but for one tradecraft error. One end of an aluminum tubular object
rose to the top rear of the bag as he swung it during his ‘drag walk’ cross-stepping.  He unsuccessfully tried to stuff it deeper in the bag with a scowl on his face. This was a danger cue I picked up on,
although in a hypnotic trance.</p>
<p>    b.<span>  I was slowly driving northbound and a</span>s programmed, I immediately opened my sunroof, and pulled
over my car after passing him. I stepped out, but did not walk towards him as I detected danger.  My Honda SUV was between us, with Mitch (JTF) about 15 feet behind the car on the sidewalk.  I
stood in the middle of Edith Drive with my driver’s door open for perhaps ten seconds trying to resist the mind control.  When I decided to abort the program, my seat was covered
with a liquid dripping in from the sunroof. 
I brushed it aside with my hand not knowing what it was and sat in the seat.  Next liquid dropped through the sunroof and soaked into my right pant leg, and a spurt of it landed diagonally across the hood from the direction of Mitch (JTF.)</p>
<p>    c.<span>  </span>I closed the sunroof, drove the two blocks home, and quickly changed my
jeans.  In the initial panic I took one drag from a cigarette and felt nothing, it was like inhaling air.  There was no Nicotine blood level elevation from the inhaled smoke since my bloodstream was dangerously saturated with Nicotine already.  I butted out the cigarette immediately. My heart was banging loudly in my chest
like never before at less than sixty beats per minute.  I used special breathing techniques from
Martial Art study to direct blood, and oxygen to my heart, still partly in a
trance.  After about twenty to thirty minutes, my
heart started to return to normal, and I narrowly survived the indirect hit from a medium-length, Nicotine liquid laden, heart attack gun. </p><h4>6. 2014 Q3-2015 Q1 - Coerced into acting in a faked, hate, snuff film</h4><p>Sometime in about the last nine months, Mitch (JTF) produced a faked, hate, snuff film with myself as the actor; I do not yet remember details of the initial snatch-and-grab part.  </p><p>No one died, but it looks like they did in
the video.  This was his trump card, his
way of having the Israeli Special Operations and Intelligence, Mossad murder
his whistleblower for him. Probably the 1940 agreement between the RCMP and the OSS (and thus its modern-day agreement) does not allow actual assassinations of Canadian test subjects, only tests of lethal weapons which might not be successful.  So Mitch (JTF) needed a fail-safe way to take out his whistleblowers.</p><p>He unequivocal words after the film were “Good, now
you are dead!”  This suggests he may
have had experience manipulating the Mossad in this way before, and in so being
manipulated, the Mossad would have been prolonging the professional life of an actual
Nazi Jew hater/killer. Mitch gleaned Jew targets to satisfy his Nazi urges in his intended last contact with his whistleblower test subjects before a lethal weapons test. Then he deceived the Mossad into killing his whistle blower test subjects for him by leaking a faked, hate, snuff film so his career could continue. Its the most diabolical, devious plot I have ever witnessed or heard of. </p>
<h4>7. 15-07-13 - Break in from the Isreali Special Operations and Intelligence, Mossad</h4><p>
</p><p>Since
trauma-dissociation causes amnesia, it was not until early July that I recalled
the Nazi-revealing events of the May home invasion.  I did three things:</p>
<p>    a. 
Visited the Israeli consulate in Toronto, but I was not let in due to
heightened security during the Pan-Am games according to John the security
guard</p>
<p>    b. 
Visited the Holy Blossom Temple, the oldest Jewish congregation in Toronto and
informed the president of these facts</p>
<p>    c.  July  11 I sent a private message to the Mossad on Facebook, telling them of
these facts. I also posted it on my timeline. (I removed it from Facebook on July 15, 2015 at the request of a
Mossad officer.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">On
July 13, 2015 my house was broken into at 3:40 AM.  An alarm went off and
a person mounted an electric scooter in front of my house and drove away. While
the police were present they got a call that an electric scooter driver was being
held. They quickly left to interview him.  </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Fifteen minutes after the police left, at 4:45
AM three riders of the same electric scooters drove by the front of my house on
Montgomery Avenue twice, during the same time period another electric scooter
driver was being interviewed.  According to Victor Ostrovsky’s book “By
Way of Deception: Making and Unmasking a Mossad Officer” the Mossad operate in
teams of four, like JTF2.</span><br/></p>
<p></p><h4>8. 15-07-15 - Mossad Visit: Hypnosis Interrogation, House Search, Death Threat</h4><p> <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A bald man with a large cranium, long limbs and wearing dark sunglasses walked back and forth in front of my house every few minutes for twenty minutes.  On the fifth time I said ""Good Morning"".  He said ""Good Morning, I know"" and continued walking West past my front yard. He soon returned and said to me from the sidewalk </span>through<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> my front yard bushes, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">“We know about Mitch, JTF, thanks for telling us.” </span></p>
<p>“Are you Mossad?” I asked. “Yes,” he admitted exasperatedly. He explained “your Facebook post naming Mossad and Mitch is making things difficult.......” “OK, I’ll take it down,” I said. “That big post before it, the one sent to all the newspapers, you should take us out of it.” “But that’s history, the email is sent, I can’t change it,” I replied. “Well, since you cannot even word spell our full name correctly (Israeli Special Operations and Intelligence, Mossad), please change it just to just Israeli Intelligence Services on the Facebook post,” he argued. “OK,” I replied.</p>
<p>As he turned and started to walk west he stopped behind the biggest bush and said “Did Mitch ever mention anything about a snuff movie to you?” “No, he did not,” I said truthfully.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A little bit later he approached from the west and stopped in front of the large bush, which mostly concealed his figure. “Alpha... Beta...? Are you in there?” he called in a carefully chosen voice that was very animated and sing-song. Within five seconds I responded, “Yes”. “Are you in trance?” he asked. “Yes,” I said. “Good, so which are you right now? Alpha or Beta?” he asked.<br/></p><p>“Alpha” I replied, slowly, and with a deep voice. Immediately there was the “zzzzzzzip” sound of metal being pulled out of tight clothing, a “shhhh, snap, click” as a magazine was inserted and a “click” as a safety was turned off. The backlit human figure shadow on the other side of the bush in that moment went from front-facing, to side facing with body arching slightly away from the perceived threat, and an orange-red dot danced among the leaves between us.</p><p>“Beta, Beta, Beta, I am Beta, I am Beta” I said rapidly. “Why did you say Alpha then?” he demanded. “Its the first alter that popped up, you are on my property” I replied. “I am on the sidewalk,” he replied. “But you are behind a bush talking to me and, I don’t know you and cannot see you,” I replied. I was in Beta alter (passive, compliant,) answering his questions truthfully. </p><p>“You’re sure you are Beta?” he asked. “Yes, yes, Beta, I am Beta” I assured him. “Well you just about got yourself killed,” he said with exasperation. After a few clicks, and metallic sounds, he then silently slid his weapon into his clothing. [Thank you 'Marcus'.]</p><p>He took a few steps in on the private sidewalk. “Can I approach?” he asked. “Yes” I replied. He got to the stairs and stopped. “That is a big screwdriver you have there.” “Yes it is,” I said as I placed by hands palm up above the 24 inch slot screwdriver laying across my Muskoka chair to lessen my threat. </p><p>“Could you put it down please?” he asked. “Yes” I replied, and I tossed it to my right side, which was necessary to roll-it out of reach to comply with the spirit of his request. The heavy screwdriver made a loud bang as it bounced on the porch, and then rolled away, which he seemed to fixate on. </p><p>A more heavy set Mossad officer with side burns approached and stood beside him. The first officer turned to him and said, ""He is in a trance.  He is Beta now.  He switches very fast, so be aware of that."" The side-burned officer gave an aggressive look and exhibited hostile body language suggesting he was about to take action. The bald, intellectual officer turned to him and said ""not now, he doesn't remember anything.""  </p><p>The first officer came up on the porch. ""You will know me as Marcus,"" he announced. He said, ""It would look more natural if I was sitting when talking with you.  May I sit?""  ""Yes, sure sit down,"" I said.  I was interrogated about what I had
reported about Mitch (JTF) being a Nazi Jew hater/killer, and related
questions.  He again asked
if I knew about a snuff film, and I truthfully reported no.  </p><p></p><p>I asked, ""If you appreciate my help turning over Mitch then what was the electric bikes and break-in about the other night?""  He smiled and said ""That was to scare you” and he added “We wanted to let you know we were coming.”  </p><p>He said ""That's pretty good what you are doing as whistleblower, with weaving in related issues.""  ""Thanks,"" I said.  ""We can't kill you because we'd be killing a whistleblower,"" he said.  I wondered why they would want to kill me, I just turned over a Nazi to them, and saved my friends' lives.  I realized within twenty-four hours his words were deception, to give me a false sense of security, as is clear but what happened next.</p>
<p>After asking permission to come inside, we moved inside and the side-burned officer went upstairs and I heard him walk into our South bedroom closet (90 year old wood floors creak.) He photographed the alarm system panel, the location of which I had posted on Facebook when documenting Mitch (JTF) having photographed it in January.  Upon his return Marcus asked
""Did you get it?""  The side burned officer
replied ""Yes, got it."" The side-burned officer inspected the label on my
bulletproof vest no doubt to later lookup the specifications and thus the firepower needed to penetrate it.   </p><p>We moved outside after a bit of more mundane discussion.  Marcus sat beside me on the porch again. ""You know how in
your Facebook postings you talk about 'missing time?' ""Yes,"" I
responded. He leaned in close on my left and continued “I have news for you Matthew... You
have missing time.” ""No!!"", I said in panic as I held my head in my hands.  The side-burned officer was squatting to my right said, “You did a hate
crime.”  He added, “God’s anger must be avenged.”  They prompted me
to start remembering and left.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thirty-six hours
later I fled my house seeking a safer place (my wife was out of town helping relatives with a new
baby.)  I have since recalled and posted
all the salient details of the ‘video event’ including that the person did not
die, and that in addition to be Scopolamine dosed, tortured repeatedly,
hypnotized I still would not participate. 
Finally Mitch (JTF) pulled out a black handgun and pointed it at me saying, “You’ll do
it or you’re dead”.  </p><p>My dissociated Alpha
alter did an act of violence while coerced at gunpoint. The target stopped breathing, and after appearing on camera with a white mask Mitch pulled out a mirror and held it over their open mouth angled to the camera to show there was no fog.  Then he ran off camera and the video must have ended there.  He returned promptly without the mask but holding a hand-held respirator retrieved from an open gym bag about six feet left of the camera, the kind you squeeze a polymer bottle and it forces air through a nose-mouth mask.  Mitch resuscitated them.  I saw him pull off the respirator and they lifted their head. </p>
<p>I posted on
Facebook, and privately to the Mossad instructions for conducting forensics on
the audio track that will prove the video does not depict an authentic event, i.e. no loss of life.  The Mossad have refused to respond, so I am left with an outstanding death threat from the most feared
assassins on the planet.  </p><h3>Reader Cool Down Area</h3><p>If desired the reader can read of other events during the ten years of my non-consensual MKULTRA weapons testing in an earlier false-start crowdsource campaign at <a href=""http://igg.me/at/murderoftime"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Murder of Time</a>, but its a similarly intense, heavy read.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In handling such a traumatic life, two books I have treasured more than most are:</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">1.

Intro






My name is Matthew Pauly.  I am Canadian.  I earned a
B.A. in Sociology and Computer Studies and have been working in my field
successfully for 26 years until recently.  My parents were American. 
I was baptized an Anglican, and raised a Unitarian.  I became a Buddhist
(and thus Vegetarian) in 2010 after a near death experience involving this true
story.  My father was a Cultural
Anthropologist and Sociologist; I was taught to non-violently fight for
equality, social justice and especially for the rights of North American
Indians.  I have no criminal record. 
I have been married to a wonderful woman from China for the past
thirteen years.  Our son is in university.  My wife reports that what
our family has been through in the past ten years with all the shock, raw fear,
and illness far eclipses what she experienced growing up in a top targeted
family in The Peoples Republic of China during Mao's Cultural
Revolution. 
I am a non-consensual, MKULTRA Monarch mind-control “sleeper
assassin” test subject, and non-consensual chemical weapons tester.  I was chosen in
part because the US Joint Task Force (JTF,) and Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(RCMP) knew I had suffered severe Psychological Trauma as a child which means under torture I dissociate quicker than most.  To dissociate means the dominant personality goes to sleep to protect itself.  In 1940 it was announced in The Ottawa Citizen that the RCMP were partnering with the OSS (CIA precursor) in a project to develop ""better assassins."" 
Once
dissociated, resisting hypnosis is very difficult, and dissociative amnesia starts immediately after the event so the victim is handicapped in gathering evidence like seeking medical attention or calling the police.  After the dissociation event they have 'missing time' for from months to years.  The anonymous handler is never fingered for the crime.  My first non-consensual training event was a 2005 JTF-->JTF2 (Joint Task Force Two is Canadian) training exercise titled “Joint-Control, Unified Command 2005” (JC UC ’05), with RCMP support. In that event my X-handler Mitch (JTF) asked about of my childhood.  I told him of some of the traumas.  He responded, “Yes, I know.  We look far and wide for people like you
Matthew.”



All three Canadian military officers in the event made penance to me personally during or after the event.  It was clear the drugging, torture (electricity, physical assaults, and worse,) hypnosis, and forced confession (by RCMP) sickened them. They also stopped the JTF officer from taking me off to Pearson International Airport where he had a jet waiting to take me to Guantanamo Bay.  They knew I was no terrorist as all I had admitted was that I would defend my country if invaded. 
For a graphic idea of what this whistleblowing book is about, have
a quick view of this “American ULTRA” movie trailer that although a comedy (for
mass appeal), contains accurate depictions of how a sleeper assassin or super-soldier
can be triggered with only a few words. 
Note the lead character says he wonders if he is a robot, i.e.
programmed.  What's not in the trailer is the repeated torture and hypnosis needed to create a sleeper assassin, and for a super-soldier years of this and additionally military training.

This book project has taken ten years of my life, and its so
close to completion, I can feel the power of this endeavour.  I have been
contacted by over a half dozen MKULTRA test-subjects in the past year alone
including a super-soldier.  I have video-conferenced with several of them;
they were all authentic.  They told me its important that I write this
book; they do not have the resources, and support to do so.  They are suffering profoundly, but
this book gives them hope.
I owe it to all non-consensual test subjects to whistle blow
this massive abuse of human rights, and Geneva conventions.  These torture-conditioned, Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) suffering, hypnotically-programmed victims are employed like human robots, without consent, and this is human trafficking. These victims are used as:
    i)  Assassins
    ii) Actors in manufactured terror events (mass murders) to manipulate the public to tolerate rights reducing laws and policies favouring covert, powerful groups within the political-security apparatus
    iii) Information couriers
    iv) Sex slaves to entrap politicians and persons of interest for intelligence gathering and blackmail
     v) Spies
    vi) Patsies to take blame for assassinations and manufactured terror events
   vii) Chemical, Biological and Radiological lethal weapons testers
I owe it to the 6,000 North American Indian, Canadian children who mysteriously died while in government mandated, religious Residential Schools over a forty year period, where most were physically, sexually and even torture abused.  My contacts in the American Indian Movement report that children were taken in groups of two or three to the Infirmary during the day. The next morning it would be announced they died.  Closed (empty) coffins would publicly be buried.  
Some of the other children awoke in the night and heard American-accented officials take the Infirmary children away.  These CIA or military MKULTRA program officials would have been introduced to the school administration by the RCMP, otherwise they would not have been trusted.  All of these children were used for MKULTRA experiments, and would have been eventually killed in lethal weapons tests. Some have survived in the USA to tell of this story.  I owe it to them to expose this non-consensual human experimentation.

At a recent place of
refuge, I have wiped tears from another victim’s cheek, and hugged them close. They cried and thanked me.  They have been used as a non-consensual
information courier, through torture-trauma dissociation and hypnosis, and remain
haunted from the terrible sexual and physical abuse (torture) they suffered as
a child, and as an adult.
Your contribution will make a significant impact in stopping
human suffering, and stopping the abuse of our democracies through manufactured
terror events.




Establishing Credibility

1. Insider Information: How to spot a
sleeper assassin
 I will share here all I know about detecting signs of a mind-controlled, ‘sleeper assassin’.  This is useful for analyzing video of actors in terror events, and their court appearances.  All of the signs I am relating are based on my real world experience as a non-consensual, mind-controlled ‘sleeper assassin’ test subject of Mitch (JTF) operating out of the US Consulate in Toronto until recently, and assisted by the RCMP. 
1. High-dosage Scopolamine is required to
remove free will in the subject. The signs of Scopolamine impairment:
    a. 
Dilated pupils
    b. 
Droopy eyelids: The upper
eyelid rests lower on the eye than normal, almost obscuring the top part of the
pupil
    c. 
Slow blinking: Eyelid blinking
is slower than normal
    d. 
Very foul bad breath:
Scopolamine clearing in the body causes foul gases to be released by the lungs,
thus the Columbian First Peoples name for it: “Devil’s
Breath”
    e. 
Heavy legs: loss of strength in
the legs requiring extra will power just to stand up right, walk, and run
    f. 
Heavy head: The subject may
have trouble keeping their head held up straight, e.g. they might be “bobbing”
their head while seated
    g. 
Loss of willpower: subject will
do virtually whatever they are told with no resistance, including acts of
violence especially when combined with torture-trauma dissociation and hypnosis
    h. 
Post-event amnesia: Scopolamine
intoxication causes amnesia for 3 to 5 days following the time period
the person was intoxicated (will be at least several hours.)  Usually a subject is torture-trauma
dissociated concurrently, which in itself causes amnesia for usually months to many
years
2. After the Scopolamine intoxication is combined
with torture-trauma to cause dissociation, finally the subject is put in a
hypnotic trance.  Signs of a hypnotic
trance:
    a. 
‘Clear Eyes’ is the
intelligence community code for an active sleeper.  The subject’s eyes are vacant, and staring
blankly
    b. 
There are abrupt changes in
behavior when previously programmed triggers 
(through hypnosis) are present. 
Triggers can include hearing a person’s name, or a sentence spoken to
them, or even a non-verbal signal.  These triggers can even be
effectively delivered by a phone call, made from a blocked or faked number of
course.  This last point is just a repeat
of declassified MKULTRA CIA documents, see CIA Mind Control: Declassified Documents
2. Supportive Medical Documentation
In late 2005 I was diagnosed with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD.)  I have had over 500 hours of therapy from both a Psychiatrist
specializing in Psychological Trauma, and a Psychodynamic Psychotherapist with forty
years experience (over $25,000 CAD spent.)   I was nearly healed until career interference in 2011-12-13, and
then resumption of non-consensual tests in 2014. 
Below is a letter that
attests a Psychiatrist specializing in Psychological Trauma (PTSD) at first had concerns that my claim of the 2005 torture-interrogation, and mind-control event might be false but after many years of
extensive therapy and drug trials, he could not find a delusional illness.  He now heads a Psychiatric
department at a hospital that is close to a Canadian Air Force base. His team has successfully treated hundreds of PTSD-suffering soldiers from the war in
Afghanistan.  Many more such professional teams are needed.
UPDATE OCT-18-2015: Removed letter image.  The doctor did not agree to my posting the letter on the Internet.  I have permission to include it in my book.  Below is a two paragraph excerpt from the letter.
=========================================
Since his initial presentation he has had trials of three different antipsychotic medications due to my concerns that these memories may be false.  This includes a trial clozapine, well known to be an antipsychotic with superior efficacy.  He retains full memory of the events in question despite these trials.  He has not been diagnosed with a Delusional Disorder.
He has never presented with suicidal ideations, intentions, or plans.

3.  Credible Co-Author Joins Project
I have teamed up with Ann Diamond who has published several
books about her survival as a child from non-consensual, mind-control experiments of Dr.
Ewen Cameron (CIA funded) in McGill Victoria Hospital, and the Allan Memorial
Institute in Montreal in the 1950s. 
I
have read Ann's “A Certain Girl” and was riveted. The more complete “My Cold War” remains the definitive
book on this era of mind-control experimentation in Canada, and is used in post-secondary courses.  

What We Need
and Community Benefit

My family and I
need a security presence for the two months needed to complete this whistle blower
book. There are two outstanding death threats, one of which is credible as it was delivered in person to me at my house by two members of the Israeli Special Operations and Intelligence, Mossad on July 15, 2015.  The US security apparatus (JTF or other) might take termination action, given they attempted murder in an MKULTRA fatal weapons test on June 21, 2014, and again on June 4, 2015. This last one was a very close call.
Since I have been unable to work for 2.5 years due to PTSD symptoms, we borrowed money to buy a burglar alarm system, and surveillance cameras.  This consumer-grade burglar alarm system and cameras are child’s play to Special
Forces and intelligence agencies.A security expert in 2014 performed a threat assessment on our situation, during an hour long interview.  He said there is no question we need to move into a 'Safe House' immediately, and it would cost about $20,000 per month.  We thought that was too expensive and perhaps not warranted.Now we realize that he was right.  If we don't raise enough money for a safe house, then at least we would hope to raise enough to have 24X7 guard(s) until the book is published.  Security Threats We Experienced in the Last YearMost readers will be shocked, and even in disbelief upon reading below what experiments have been done on my family and I in the past year -- why would government security forces do such heinous experiments on civilians?  Please view this video which depicts a hypnosis-only created assassin, and how dangerous that hypnotically programmed person became, and how they suffered amnesia after the event thus providing ""Plausible Deniability"" to the controller in a real situation. This will give you an idea why security forces are willing to commit such crimes against humanity to perfect the art of mind-control.  Power is a drug.1. 14-06-21 - Chemical Weapons Test: Fog Delivery of Scopolamine AerosolI narrowly survived
a near-fatal weapons test on Montgomery Avenue in Toronto at 7:00 AM.  I was drawn into the trap by Mitch talking through a Voice-to-Skull (V2K) transmitter that drew me to investigate the source of the sound.  He used the microwave sourced voice transmission to lure me to the only secluded place on my block.  Then he executed a perfect military roll into crouching position from behind a fake bush mounted on a board adjacent to a parking lot.  He stood and was dressed in black, with a  gas mask, holding a black hose with a nozzle resembling that found on a fire extinguisher that emanated a white fog.  Fog blasted all around me forming a cloud as he stepped over the fake bush, which briefly caught his boot.  I held my breath and was stunned.  As the flog settled to below my eye level, I recognized him by his body shape, and voice when he stepped back from the fog.  I said sarcastically ""Thanks!"".  He pulled off the gas mask and responded  ""Anytime Matthew!"" with heavy emphasis on my name, dripping with contempt.  My eyes, nose, lips and throat burned and I turned to run.  My legs became very heavy immediately; I recognized it was Scopolamine from its use in the 2007 event (in book.)I managed to run to the most public piece of grass about twenty feet away before collapsing unable to breathe.  I stopped breathing and went
unconscious three times.  Our family
Golden Retriever Cody was mortally injured in that event for the crime of licking my lips and nose to revive me once as I lay unconscious, not breathing and helpless on the grass.  He did exactly as a mother dog does to her puppies at birth, and he revived me once before he was injured.The US JTF mortally injured a Golden Retriever because he was interfering with their fatal-weapons test. Below is a
photo of our shrine to Cody, on the shelf that used to contain the microwave that Mitch (JTF) sabotaged  as part of another MKULTRA experiment. (see 3. g. below) 2. 14-07-09 Fatal Weapons Test TrapOnce I recovered the trauma-dissociated memory of the June 4, 2014 Chemical Weapons test, I was shocked and degraded to have been gassed on Canadian soil, by Special Forces of our closest ally, a country my parents were born in.  I could have had American citizenship at 18 but I declined.  My American lineage goes back to 1630 when the ""John and Mary"" arrived from Scotland, where my ancestor John P. came from the lowlands. Being gassed injured my dignity deeply and I felt I needed to do some symbolic act to regain it.On July 9, 2014 I performed twenty minutes of
street theatre by playing loud rock music in my car with windows down while
parked across the street from the back entrance of the US Consulate.   A security guard pointed me out to another guard, and one of them went inside, likely to call the police.  In fifteen minutes in two marked police cars drove slowly by but did not talk to me even though I was parked at a stop sign. I drove
home about five minutes later. Then the US JTF promptly sent two
watchers to Montgomery Avenue in different cars.  I walked towards them with a
walking stick (legal) and they fled. 
One
hour later, an assassin trap (fatal weapons test) was set on Montgomery Avenue
featuring a new JTF actor with a poison marker pen in a red car.  I sensed danger and avoided the trap. It
turns out puffing one’s chest at Godzilla is not such a good idea.  The athletic looking man with a professional calm but serious demeanour in the red car in the video below leaves his passengers side window all the way down, tempting me to poke my walking stick inside (which I would never do.) He would have grabbed and pulled the stick in, and with my arm within reach he would have swiped the poison marker pen on my skin.  [Mitch (JTF) in the January 2015 home invasion said: ""You figured all that out huh?""]  I put the video up on Facebook.  Click the link below, then press the HD button at the bottom right of the video page.  Notice as I walk by the man in the red car raises his arms to protect his head, and to be ready to grab the stick if it was poked in, with the poison laden marker held in his teeth cap end first for a quick draw (there is no paper visible.)  He lowers his arms once I pass by.  Later that evening he jogged back and forth on our side of the block in the pouring rain for a full hour, soaked, holding up an umbrella anyway, just to demonstrate his athleticism and to intimidate.

    a.  Administration of a noxious substance: Scopolamine aerosol from
a spray can as I lay sleeping in my bed after my wife left for work
    b.  Torture with elbow hyperextension to cause dissociation while kneeling on my back
    c.  Non-consensual hypnosis, with forced repeat of
post-hypnotic suggestions
    d.  Rape and death threat (it turns out Mitch is Gay.) This started with him asking me to turn over onto my back in bed, as he knew all about my martial arts training and wanted to inspect my physique. ""Turn over Matthew, I want to take a look at you.  But before you do, instead of seeing my face, you're only going to only see a black region where my face is. You will not see or be able to remember my face.""  I turned over. ""Wow, you're a lot bigger than the last time I saw you!"" he said as he saw the muscle development from my training.  I will spare you the details of what happened after he asked me to turn back over.  Afterwards he said, ""You know if you tell anyone I will kill you, right?""
    e.  Interrogation, in particular to determine if the leader of my Russian Martial Art school had turned me into a ""double sleeper agent.""  Over and over again he asked ""Come on Matthew, is there a Russian accented controller in there.""  There was lots of torture.  There was no Russian controller, as first the instructor is now Canadian, and second he would never risk destroying his business by getting involved in covert activities.    f.  Gun held to my head.   During the interrogation Mitch (JTF) asked what I meant in a Facebook posting when I wrote ""Next time he tries to pick me up it will get messy.""  He asked ""Do you have a knife Matthew?""  ""No,"" I replied.  ""Come on Matthew, do you have any knives?"" he asked over and over while using torture. ""There are knives in the kitchen,"" I replied.  ""Then what did you mean by that statement?"" Mitch asked.  I replied, ""I meant I would resist.""  A moment passed and I realized even dissociated, that I promised myself that I would resist, I remembered my martial arts study.  Suddenly I started violently rocking him off my back.  In about two seconds I felt a blunt hard object pressed against my skull. I froze.  ""Do you know what this is Matthew?"" he asked in a serious tone.  ""Yes, its all shiny,"" I replied remembering him pulling out his all chromed handgun in the 2005 event.  ""That's right, you remember!"" he said angrily.  ""I ought to blow you away right now,"" he added in anger.  There were a few terrifying moments of silence as he decided his next move. Then he got off me, and I heard a ""click"" (safety on.)  At first I thought it was the trigger but then realized the bullet would be in my brain before I heard the click of the trigger.  Then I heard the ""SSSHHHHHHHH"" sound of the spray can of Scopolamine behind me.  I called out, ""You Bastard!"" not knowing if I would ever wake up.
    g.  Sabotaged our microwave oven as part of a mind-control
experiment to see how long a test subject could be mind-controlled to not
remember a health threat to his family. He led me (in dissociated Beta alter) to the microwave and demanded I watch as he pulled out a pen-knife and carefully peeled up a corner of the polycarbonate film on the door inside glass, and peeled it all off in one piece.  I protested but he repeated twice ""trust me, you don't need this.""  Then he made me repeat about ten times ""I will not remember this, I will not remember this, etc.""  It took six months for the mind-control to wear off.  My wife is slightly impatient and stands in front of the microwave waiting for it to finish. She is the one who got the high-dose of microwaves. Without that film, much more microwaves leak from the oven.  I bought a good RF meter and measured a 500% increase compared to a neighbour's microwave with film intact, same brand, same wattage.  
    h.  Leaked information about his Nazi grandfather (Project
Paperclip) torturing him at a young age and doing everything to him that he has
done to me, and other facts he wanted me to leak in my writings to garner sympathy for him.    i. Forced repeating (about 10 times) of a post-hypnotic suggestion ""When I hear the air horn sounded twice below my bedroom window, I will strangle my wife for 10 seconds, and then let her go.""   Mitch (JTF) asked me to listen as he sounded the hand-held airhorn once so I would know the timbre and pitch.  Within two weeks, in the middle of the night he sounded the airhorn twice below my bedroom window.  Upon barely grasping my wife's neck with one hand while in a hypnotic trance, my wife shouted ""Matthew!!"" and I stopped, and fell back asleep.  She told me what happened in the morning.  Its clear the intent of this was not just an MKULTRA experiment, but to establish a pattern of homicidal violence so useful in a last resort, staged murder-suicide to silence this whistle blower, and take out his family as collateral damage.    j.

4.  May first half, 2015: Home invasion by Mitch (JTF), RCMP

    a.  Administered a noxious substance: Scopolamine aerosol from
a spray can
    b.  Tortured to cause dissociation
    c.  Non-consensual hypnosis, with forced repeat of post-hypnotic suggestions
    d.  Let an RCMP officer in my house who recorded two forced
terror plot confessions while I was drugged, and dissociated from torture (""O' Canada"")
    e.  Let out the RCMP officer, faked his own exit, then
returned wherein he:
      i. 
Forced repeating of
post-hypnotic suggestions (about 10 times) so in the future given a certain trigger, I would
walk into a fatal weapons test trap: ""When I see you as a women walking towards me on the street in my neighborhood, I will recognize you by your same hair, and a large hole beneath your left knee.  I will open my sunroof, pull over my car, get out and walk to you.""
      ii. 
Gave a ‘termination
interview’ without naming it as such
      iii. 
Demanded all online
banking passwords which thankfully I did not know since my wife is much better at banking and does all of it
      iv.  Under torture, Mitch (JTF) asked about all my
Jewish friends, what they did for a living, and after skipping the lawyer, and
newspaper columnist, he focused in on the activist, the chair of the resident’s
association board I sit on.  He asked if
his spouse was Jewish (they are.)  He
asked how to spell their names, and where they lived. (Clearly his Nazi grandfather indoctrinated him in Nazism when he torture-conditioning Mitch from five years old.)5.  15-06-24 - Fatal chemical weapons test
    a.  Mitch (JTF) walked south on Edith drive at about 3:30 PM, on the East side only two blocks from my house. He was in high-end, very convincing ‘drag’ with an
identifying large hole below his left knee, and same haircut and colour, while swinging a very large purse looped over his left shoulder, and open
at the top. He had professional makeup, large tinted glasses, gold necklaces, sequins on his bright coloured jacket, and tight, faded to white bluejeans. He gave a movie-worthy performance but for one tradecraft error. One end of an aluminum tubular object
rose to the top rear of the bag as he swung it during his ‘drag walk’ cross-stepping.  He unsuccessfully tried to stuff it deeper in the bag with a scowl on his face. This was a danger cue I picked up on,
although in a hypnotic trance.
    b.  I was slowly driving northbound and as programmed, I immediately opened my sunroof, and pulled
over my car after passing him. I stepped out, but did not walk towards him as I detected danger.  My Honda SUV was between us, with Mitch (JTF) about 15 feet behind the car on the sidewalk.  I
stood in the middle of Edith Drive with my driver’s door open for perhaps ten seconds trying to resist the mind control.  When I decided to abort the program, my seat was covered
with a liquid dripping in from the sunroof. 
I brushed it aside with my hand not knowing what it was and sat in the seat.  Next liquid dropped through the sunroof and soaked into my right pant leg, and a spurt of it landed diagonally across the hood from the direction of Mitch (JTF.)
    c.  I closed the sunroof, drove the two blocks home, and quickly changed my
jeans.  In the initial panic I took one drag from a cigarette and felt nothing, it was like inhaling air.  There was no Nicotine blood level elevation from the inhaled smoke since my bloodstream was dangerously saturated with Nicotine already.  I butted out the cigarette immediately. My heart was banging loudly in my chest
like never before at less than sixty beats per minute.  I used special breathing techniques from
Martial Art study to direct blood, and oxygen to my heart, still partly in a
trance.  After about twenty to thirty minutes, my
heart started to return to normal, and I narrowly survived the indirect hit from a medium-length, Nicotine liquid laden, heart attack gun. 6. 2014 Q3-2015 Q1 - Coerced into acting in a faked, hate, snuff filmSometime in about the last nine months, Mitch (JTF) produced a faked, hate, snuff film with myself as the actor; I do not yet remember details of the initial snatch-and-grab part.  No one died, but it looks like they did in
the video.  This was his trump card, his
way of having the Israeli Special Operations and Intelligence, Mossad murder
his whistleblower for him. Probably the 1940 agreement between the RCMP and the OSS (and thus its modern-day agreement) does not allow actual assassinations of Canadian test subjects, only tests of lethal weapons which might not be successful.  So Mitch (JTF) needed a fail-safe way to take out his whistleblowers.He unequivocal words after the film were “Good, now
you are dead!”  This suggests he may
have had experience manipulating the Mossad in this way before, and in so being
manipulated, the Mossad would have been prolonging the professional life of an actual
Nazi Jew hater/killer. Mitch gleaned Jew targets to satisfy his Nazi urges in his intended last contact with his whistleblower test subjects before a lethal weapons test. Then he deceived the Mossad into killing his whistle blower test subjects for him by leaking a faked, hate, snuff film so his career could continue. Its the most diabolical, devious plot I have ever witnessed or heard of. 
7. 15-07-13 - Break in from the Isreali Special Operations and Intelligence, Mossad
Since
trauma-dissociation causes amnesia, it was not until early July that I recalled
the Nazi-revealing events of the May home invasion.  I did three things:
    a. 
Visited the Israeli consulate in Toronto, but I was not let in due to
heightened security during the Pan-Am games according to John the security
guard
    b. 
Visited the Holy Blossom Temple, the oldest Jewish congregation in Toronto and
informed the president of these facts
    c.  July  11 I sent a private message to the Mossad on Facebook, telling them of
these facts. I also posted it on my timeline. (I removed it from Facebook on July 15, 2015 at the request of a
Mossad officer.)

On
July 13, 2015 my house was broken into at 3:40 AM.  An alarm went off and
a person mounted an electric scooter in front of my house and drove away. While
the police were present they got a call that an electric scooter driver was being
held. They quickly left to interview him.  Fifteen minutes after the police left, at 4:45
AM three riders of the same electric scooters drove by the front of my house on
Montgomery Avenue twice, during the same time period another electric scooter
driver was being interviewed.  According to Victor Ostrovsky’s book “By
Way of Deception: Making and Unmasking a Mossad Officer” the Mossad operate in
teams of four, like JTF2.
8. 15-07-15 - Mossad Visit: Hypnosis Interrogation, House Search, Death Threat A bald man with a large cranium, long limbs and wearing dark sunglasses walked back and forth in front of my house every few minutes for twenty minutes.  On the fifth time I said ""Good Morning"".  He said ""Good Morning, I know"" and continued walking West past my front yard. He soon returned and said to me from the sidewalk through my front yard bushes, “We know about Mitch, JTF, thanks for telling us.” 
“Are you Mossad?” I asked. “Yes,” he admitted exasperatedly. He explained “your Facebook post naming Mossad and Mitch is making things difficult.......” “OK, I’ll take it down,” I said. “That big post before it, the one sent to all the newspapers, you should take us out of it.” “But that’s history, the email is sent, I can’t change it,” I replied. “Well, since you cannot even word spell our full name correctly (Israeli Special Operations and Intelligence, Mossad), please change it just to just Israeli Intelligence Services on the Facebook post,” he argued. “OK,” I replied.
As he turned and started to walk west he stopped behind the biggest bush and said “Did Mitch ever mention anything about a snuff movie to you?” “No, he did not,” I said truthfully.A little bit later he approached from the west and stopped in front of the large bush, which mostly concealed his figure. “Alpha... Beta...? Are you in there?” he called in a carefully chosen voice that was very animated and sing-song. Within five seconds I responded, “Yes”. “Are you in trance?” he asked. “Yes,” I said. “Good, so which are you right now? Alpha or Beta?” he asked.“Alpha” I replied, slowly, and with a deep voice. Immediately there was the “zzzzzzzip” sound of metal being pulled out of tight clothing, a “shhhh, snap, click” as a magazine was inserted and a “click” as a safety was turned off. The backlit human figure shadow on the other side of the bush in that moment went from front-facing, to side facing with body arching slightly away from the perceived threat, and an orange-red dot danced among the leaves between us.“Beta, Beta, Beta, I am Beta, I am Beta” I said rapidly. “Why did you say Alpha then?” he demanded. “Its the first alter that popped up, you are on my property” I replied. “I am on the sidewalk,” he replied. “But you are behind a bush talking to me and, I don’t know you and cannot see you,” I replied. I was in Beta alter (passive, compliant,) answering his questions truthfully. “You’re sure you are Beta?” he asked. “Yes, yes, Beta, I am Beta” I assured him. “Well you just about got yourself killed,” he said with exasperation. After a few clicks, and metallic sounds, he then silently slid his weapon into his clothing. [Thank you 'Marcus'.]He took a few steps in on the private sidewalk. “Can I approach?” he asked. “Yes” I replied. He got to the stairs and stopped. “That is a big screwdriver you have there.” “Yes it is,” I said as I placed by hands palm up above the 24 inch slot screwdriver laying across my Muskoka chair to lessen my threat. “Could you put it down please?” he asked. “Yes” I replied, and I tossed it to my right side, which was necessary to roll-it out of reach to comply with the spirit of his request. The heavy screwdriver made a loud bang as it bounced on the porch, and then rolled away, which he seemed to fixate on. A more heavy set Mossad officer with side burns approached and stood beside him. The first officer turned to him and said, ""He is in a trance.  He is Beta now.  He switches very fast, so be aware of that."" The side-burned officer gave an aggressive look and exhibited hostile body language suggesting he was about to take action. The bald, intellectual officer turned to him and said ""not now, he doesn't remember anything.""  The first officer came up on the porch. ""You will know me as Marcus,"" he announced. He said, ""It would look more natural if I was sitting when talking with you.  May I sit?""  ""Yes, sure sit down,"" I said.  I was interrogated about what I had
reported about Mitch (JTF) being a Nazi Jew hater/killer, and related
questions.  He again asked
if I knew about a snuff film, and I truthfully reported no.  I asked, ""If you appreciate my help turning over Mitch then what was the electric bikes and break-in about the other night?""  He smiled and said ""That was to scare you” and he added “We wanted to let you know we were coming.”  He said ""That's pretty good what you are doing as whistleblower, with weaving in related issues.""  ""Thanks,"" I said.  ""We can't kill you because we'd be killing a whistleblower,"" he said.  I wondered why they would want to kill me, I just turned over a Nazi to them, and saved my friends' lives.  I realized within twenty-four hours his words were deception, to give me a false sense of security, as is clear but what happened next.
After asking permission to come inside, we moved inside and the side-burned officer went upstairs and I heard him walk into our South bedroom closet (90 year old wood floors creak.) He photographed the alarm system panel, the location of which I had posted on Facebook when documenting Mitch (JTF) having photographed it in January.  Upon his return Marcus asked
""Did you get it?""  The side burned officer
replied ""Yes, got it."" The side-burned officer inspected the label on my
bulletproof vest no doubt to later lookup the specifications and thus the firepower needed to penetrate it.   We moved outside after a bit of more mundane discussion.  Marcus sat beside me on the porch again. ""You know how in
your Facebook postings you talk about 'missing time?' ""Yes,"" I
responded. He leaned in close on my left and continued “I have news for you Matthew... You
have missing time.” ""No!!"", I said in panic as I held my head in my hands.  The side-burned officer was squatting to my right said, “You did a hate
crime.”  He added, “God’s anger must be avenged.”  They prompted me
to start remembering and left.

Thirty-six hours
later I fled my house seeking a safer place (my wife was out of town helping relatives with a new
baby.)  I have since recalled and posted
all the salient details of the ‘video event’ including that the person did not
die, and that in addition to be Scopolamine dosed, tortured repeatedly,
hypnotized I still would not participate. 
Finally Mitch (JTF) pulled out a black handgun and pointed it at me saying, “You’ll do
it or you’re dead”.  My dissociated Alpha
alter did an act of violence while coerced at gunpoint. The target stopped breathing, and after appearing on camera with a white mask Mitch pulled out a mirror and held it over their open mouth angled to the camera to show there was no fog.  Then he ran off camera and the video must have ended there.  He returned promptly without the mask but holding a hand-held respirator retrieved from an open gym bag about six feet left of the camera, the kind you squeeze a polymer bottle and it forces air through a nose-mouth mask.  Mitch resuscitated them.  I saw him pull off the respirator and they lifted their head. 
I posted on
Facebook, and privately to the Mossad instructions for conducting forensics on
the audio track that will prove the video does not depict an authentic event, i.e. no loss of life.  The Mossad have refused to respond, so I am left with an outstanding death threat from the most feared
assassins on the planet.  Reader Cool Down AreaIf desired the reader can read of other events during the ten years of my non-consensual MKULTRA weapons testing in an earlier false-start crowdsource campaign at The Murder of Time, but its a similarly intense, heavy read.In handling such a traumatic life, two books I have treasured more than most are: 1. Victor Frankl’s “Man’s Search for Meaning"" which has been a great source of strength, guiding my purpose. I made it my
meaning in life to make the world a better place.  2. Viradhammo Bhikkhu's ""The Stillness of Being"" (free online) has been a great inspiration, and peace restoring read, many times over.  It never ceases to calm me down.
Why Donate to this Book Project
Ann Diamond and I are so close to completion of this watershed book, which we hope will be a game changer. The
security expert last year strongly advised a ‘Safe house.’  A burglar alarm, and
cameras are only part of the solution.  We need a security presence (guards) for the remaining two months while the
book is being finished, if not a ‘Safe House.’ 

We need your support to safely complete this landmark humanitarian book.  Your contribution will
make a huge difference to ending significant human rights abuse, human trafficking, violations of Geneva Conventions, and the corruption of our
democracies.

</div></div>","Me and The Project 
My name is Sigal Sharon and I was born in
a Kibbutz in Israel. I am married and have 5 children , 4 boys and a
girl.
For the last
19 years I worked in the medical devices field, with my husband Dr. Akiva
Sharon - a physician and an inventor, and helped to materialize his ideas.  3 years ago Akiva suffered a medical event
and had to step aside from running the business. I carried on the activity myself until recently.

Now that this
time has come, I can go forward with my projects.
 Cetem (Splotch in Hebrew, and also Gold) was written 17 years ago when my 4th kid was born.
The story and illustrations are introduced in the video.
 Now we are in Publishing stage:  Printed and E-book
My Publishing House is Contento, partners for the book journey,  high quality people. The name of their production manager is Nati :)
I have the privilege and joy to collaborate with an excelent editor, who is also my dear childhood friend, Ms. Lilach Ron. She is not cutting me any slacks, in case you were wondering...  it's a great challange - and pleasure.
My talented and amazing doughter Shani, traveling in India now,  sent her Cover Illustration - first draft ; she agreed that I will publish and follow how the illustration is created. Here it is!


An Interactive digital book project is on the go, in paralell (not part of this funding campaign). Progress will be updated.

The Impact of the Story




Pursue and explore your dreams, wherever they take you - the story is about a journey of a splotch who dared to step out of his destiny as set by the painter for an unknown one. Along the way he meets  Nati the Black Panther who dreams to be splotched, and Motek, who wanted to be a frame, and later to become a cloud... 


The power of collaboration and sharing 


Self-acceptance  - believe in yourself, whatever color or form you are...

What to do with the bad guys? Punish? lock away? How can they reform?

Implicit impact:  dealing with colors, forms and dimensions 






SO, help me to publish the book!  At this phase, the Hebrew version - this is my goal by the present CrowdFunding project. And the English version following; already translated. 



What We Need & What You Get


The money raised will finance:
* Final version editing

* Publishing of 150 full color printed books, primarily for marketing puposes 
* E-book

* Artist's set first batch, t includes picture frame, brushes, colors and palette; and of course the book. The Artist's set is to be channeled to gift and toy stores, 

* And, it will cover my perks shipments to the contributors- you:).


The perks : 


E-book with personal dedication,  hardcover book,  Artist's set with hardcover book; T shirt with a picture from Cetem; a full package with all items.





Risks & Challenges

I have already paid first installment to the publishing house. In case I will not be able to reach my funding  goal, I can adjust the process according to the available funds. 
But I plan to reach my goal.   Other Ways You Can Help I know not everybody can contribute, but I will appreciate if you could spread the word about this campaign!
Or, if you are intersted in investing in the larger project (or knows somebody), that will be great!

<p>Greetings Good People!</p>
<p>   My name is George Lee Jr. I am a writer, poet, visual artist and spoken-word performer. I am in the midst of launching my 2nd self-published book entitled, ""Lov(H)er"". This is a book made up of ""letters"" addressed to my fellow men suggesting various ways in which to love our women more effectively. This project is very close to my heart as the concept of love within an intimate relationship is something I've always been very passionate about.  </p>
<p>   Some of the ""letters"" included in this book deal with areas such as Compromise, Communication, Foreplay, Honesty and Faithfulness. These are areas that I feel are crucial in building a functional, loving and effective intimate relationship. I was fortunate to have a living example in the form of my dad who was nothing but loving to my mother. I do realize that they are a lot of men who were not as blessed with a front row seat to a healthy display of love from a man to woman as a child. For that reason, I felt that it was my responsibility to communicate what I witnessed between my parents to my fellow men.        </p>
<p>   Assisting with the funding of this book will first and foremost allow me to get it in front of a wider audience. Most importantly, the audience who needs to read it. This will be done by way of book signings as I will be able to have product on hand to sell as well as to conduct forums, workshops and panel discussions that would circulate around the subject matter of ""Lov(H)er"".   </p>
<p>   In attempting to obtain assistance, I came up with $3000 as enough funding to jumpstart my movement. This would initially go towards printing copies of my book to have on hand. That will then enable me to schedule book signings with also enough funding (if needed) to book a space. Funding would also assist in promo materials such as business cards, videos, posters as well as banners which would be utilized during books signings. With this assistance, I would also be able to launch a website and purchase an ISBN number that would enable me to place my books in stores as well. </p>
<p>   Even during this time, feel free to place a presale order by way of my Facebook page, ""Author George Lee Jr."" If you are not able to contribute or place a presale order, you can simply support by either sharing this campaign of mine's or by getting the word out! Please check out my perks as well as any amount contributed will be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>   Thank you for your time as I implore you to share this post whenever and wherever possible. Thank you!</p>

I still managed to excel in a local history project as a part of my final exams.
Struggling for an idea I found a colour photograph taken in 1929 by my father of
the North East Coast Exhibition for which I did not really know anything about, but
this was the inspiration that quickly built up into a project comprising of 20
stories of events and significant buildings within the City of Newcastle. I divided
it into two sections; before 1900 and afterwards, up to what

time capsule until one day my wife Alison came across it.  Intrigued, she read it cover to cover with ease

<h3>A Side of Houdini Few Know<br/>
</h3> <p></p>In this wonderfully disturbing novella, THE BOX JUMPER,
 written by Bram Stoker Award Winner Lisa Mannetti, we meet Leona Derwatt, Houdini's assistant on and off stage, and one of
 his mistresses. Houdini not only takes her into his confidence, 
teaching her the intricacies of his magic, but teams with her as they 
confront and expose fraudulent psychics and mediums of their day. The 
tension in the story (based on Mannetti's thorough research) involves 
Houdini's conflicts with fake mediums (who may have been complicit in 
his death) and Leona's continued confrontations with the same phony psychics 
later in her life. <br/><br/><b><b>“Lisa Mannetti has given us a look into the life of a fascinating 
historical character and cultural icon. Her novella brims over with dark
 suspense and a brilliant re-creation of a New York long gone. As 
always, she writes with passion and originality. A great story.” — Tom 
Monteleone, Bram Stoker and Locus Award-winning author of <i>Night of Broken Souls</i> and <i>Eyes of the Virgin</i></b></b><br/><br/>This will be the 10th book published by Smart Rhino Publications, an

<b>An Excerpt from THE BOX JUMPER</b>
</h3>(Copyright © 2015 by Lisa Mannetti)<b><br/><br/></b><div align=""justify"">
<p>...<br/></p>
<p>The
fake mediums maintained that strict linkage not only enhanced cosmic vibrations
but, more important, <i>proved </i>that with their hands and feet accounted
for, any manifestations had to come directly from spirit entities. I smiled
thinking that even though Houdini had said he was going to demonstrate how
every effect could be accomplished by purely physical means, and there was
going to be absolutely<i> nothing </i>occult about this séance— because every
bit was sheer conjuring—Sir Arthur was in for something of a shock.</p>
</div>
<b>
</b><p>Just
like the phony trance artists, Houdini began with a prayer. His voice
appropriately solemn even though, as I knew, he considered using prayer and
hymns to connive believers the worst kind of blasphemy. <i>Can you imagine
anything uglier than manipulating people’s sincere belief in God to convince
them you’re genuine—the real, honest-to-Jesus ticket—when you’re just about to
scheme as many dollars as you can out of their pocketbooks? It’s disgusting. </i></p>
<p>The
last “amen” intoned, the final strains of “Nearer My God to Thee” on the
Victrola Houdini cranked up just before we’d taken seats faded, and there was a
deep silence. I could feel Doyle’s pulse against my fingertips. Houdini cleared
his throat and said, “Are there any spirits here?” </p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>“We
have to concentrate <span>... there
can be no resistance, no skepticism ...
we have to open the portal, open ourselves.” </span></p>
<p>Silence.
</p>
<p>The
merest dimming of the red lamp, but Sir Arthur’s gaze was riveted on the circle
of pale hands on the tabletop, and I wasn’t sure he’d even noticed the growing
darkness. </p>
<p>“If
any spirits are here, we ask for a sign,” Houdini said. </p>
<p>A
tremendous boom—loud and startling as the crack of thunder. At the same time,
the table rose upward swiftly and the red lamp went out with a hiss. I heard
Doyle’s sharp intake of breath, but his hand remained rooted in mine even when
we all lifted our arms as the wooden table tipped twice drunkenly, then finally
steadied itself, floating shoulder-high. Slowly, it rocked back and forth,
finally settling down against the floor.</p>
<p>“Do
you have a message for us?” Houdini breathed. A bell tinkled softly; in the
dark it was impossible to tell where the sound came from. “Who is the message
for? Show us—we beg you, please.”</p>
<p>Now
there was a whispering sound—like the rustle of satin garments—and across the
large room and out of the dark, the tiny faint outline of a dead white face
swirled, then moved slowly toward us, becoming larger and clearer. </p>
<p>“Who
are you?” Houdini said. “Who is your message for?”</p>
<p>The
eerie voice from the wavering figure was as mottled as if the thing’s throat
were choked with the dirt of the grave. “I <span>... have come ...”
it rasped painfully, then trailed off. “So distant ... so hard ...”</span></p>
<p>“Spirit,
we can help you. Who are you? What is your message?” </p>
<p>“So
much sorrow <span>...”  </span></p>
<p>“Do
either of you recognize her? Leona? Sir Arthur?” She had long wavy hair, dark
glittering eyes; her mouth was a narrow slash. Doyle and I shook our heads. </p>
<p>“Give
us a sign. Stroke the forehead of the one whose need to know brought you here.
Make the sign of the cross.” At the same instant Doyle nearly jolted out of his
seat, crying “Who <i>are</i> you?” A barely
luminescent, distinct hand seemed to be already in the process of drawing away
from the table and receding further into the darkness.</p>
<p>“That
touch was ice cold,” Doyle said. “Damn near startled me into losing my grip on
your hands, Harry.”</p>
<p>“You
did well,” Houdini said. “Your experience at so many séances over the years kept
you steady. But I think there’s more—let’s find out who this woman is and what
she wants to tell you,” Houdini said. Then he addressed the spirit. “On the
large desk near the standing globe, you’ll find a bowl with warm paraffin;
place your hands in it—then dip them into the bowl of cool water alongside. If
you understand me, tap three times for yes.”</p>
<p>Three
sharp raps knocked against the wooden table.</p>
<p>“Excellent.
Sir Arthur, did you wash the slates on all four sides as I told you before we
started?”</p>
<p>“Yes,
you gave me the damp sponge yourself, my dear boy.”</p>
<p>“And
they were completely blank on all four sides?”</p>
<p>“Yes.
“</p>
<p>“And
you strung them from the cord we set up before we began?”</p>
<p>“Certainly.
They’re right where I hung them—just over our heads.” A stream of cold air
blasted around us and I felt Doyle’s hand quake.</p>
<p>“Spirit,
there is a set of locked slates—the same type children use in
schoolrooms—dangling in midair just above this table. Kindly write your name
and tell us why you’re here. In particular, why you’ve come to see Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle.”</p>
<p>There
was a brief pause <span>... then,
scratching, like chalk writing on a blackboard.</span></p>
<p>“Do
you hear that?” Doyle breathed.</p>
<p>“Yes,”
I said.</p>
<p>Houdini
asked for quiet <span>... then a last
prayerful invocation. “I’m going to use self-hypnosis to induce a trance state
in myself, and I’m going to ask whatever spirits are present to rekindle the
red lamp very, very slowly. And if they favor us, to give us a definite
sign—the most definite sign possible from the other side. I’ll say the prayer
and Leona and Sir Arthur, you must entreat the spirit of this woman—or any
others nearby. I’ll say the prayer while you chant ‘<i>Donnez</i>.’ He took a deep breath. “Our Father who art in Heaven ...”</span></p>
<p>Doyle
and I kept a steady rhythm. <i>“Donnez, donnez </i>... <i>donnez, donnez pour nous, donnez.”</i></p>
<p>By
the gleam of the light we saw a tiny wisp—like spider web—slowly inch out from
Houdini’s mouth. Gradually, it thickened and seemed to grow heavier, pulling at
him. He lay his head down on the table and the ectoplasm twirled from between
his lips and coiled over his chin until the large faintly glowing mass puddled
on the table. His eyes were closed; his breathing was so shallow Houdini
appeared to have fainted.</p>
<p>“It’s
all right, Sir Arthur,” I said. “You’ve seen me on stage with him, and I know
what to do.”</p>
<p>I
called his name, we broke the circle, and I tapped his shoulder.</p>
<p>A
few seconds later, his eyes fluttered open and he sat up.</p>
<p>“Are
you dizzy? You look quite pale,” Sir Arthur said. He turned to me. “I’m
speaking as a doctor now, he’s white as a sheet and I think he ought to have a
sip of brandy.”</p>
<p>“He
doesn’t drink—”</p>
<p>“Well,
he needs something. Let me feel his pulse.”</p>
<p>“I’m
all right <span>... really,” Houdini
said, but his smile appeared pasted on, rather than genuine. “I must’ve been
out of it. I was really under. Did something happen?” <br/></span></p>

<p><i>Juventud </i>explores the idealism of youth, the
complexities of a ravaged country, and the stories we tell ourselves in order
to survive. Growing up as the only daughter of a wealthy landowner in Santiago
de Cali, Colombia, teenaged Mercedes Martinez knows a world of maids, armed
guards, and private drivers. When she falls in love with Manuel, a fiery young
activist with a passion for his faith and his country, she begins to understand
the suffering of the <i>desplazados </i>who
share her land. </p>
<p>A startling discovery about her father forces Mercedes to doubt
everything she thought she knew about her life, and she and Manuel make plans
to run away together. But before they can, tragedy strikes in a single violent
night. Mercedes flees Colombia for the United States and a life she never could
have imagined. Fifteen years later, she returns to Colombia seeking the truth,
but discovers that only more questions await.</p>

</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This riveting story, part sociopolitical thriller and part
love story, lyrically told, marks the culmination of the copious research and
drafting which I began in 2009, and relied on the support of several writers’
colonies to complete, including Yaddo, Ragdale, the Virginia Center for the
Creative Arts, and others. </p>
<p>After so many years of working on the project, I am
ecstatic that <i>Juventud </i>has found a
home with the Chicago-based independent press, Curbside Splendor Publishing, and
I am committed to bringing the novel to the widest audience possible upon its
release this fall.  In the Northeast I am
scheduled to present at the Burlington Book Festival, the Fall for the Book in
Fairfax, VA, then will head to launch events in Chicago and Minneapolis, Boston
and NYC. In November, the tour heads south and will include my home state of
Florida, Savannah, Charleston, Charlotte, Nashville, and D.C. </p>

Orlando, FL. While the publisher is arranging the tour, they are not funding it. My only source of income during the fall will be the online

flexibility but will amount to a small paycheck that will just cover monthly
essentials. </p>

</div></div>","Story Summary 
Juventud explores the idealism of youth, the
complexities of a ravaged country, and the stories we tell ourselves in order
to survive. Growing up as the only daughter of a wealthy landowner in Santiago
de Cali, Colombia, teenaged Mercedes Martinez knows a world of maids, armed
guards, and private drivers. When she falls in love with Manuel, a fiery young
activist with a passion for his faith and his country, she begins to understand
the suffering of the desplazados who
share her land. 
A startling discovery about her father forces Mercedes to doubt
everything she thought she knew about her life, and she and Manuel make plans
to run away together. But before they can, tragedy strikes in a single violent
night. Mercedes flees Colombia for the United States and a life she never could
have imagined. Fifteen years later, she returns to Colombia seeking the truth,
but discovers that only more questions await.
   

My Journey  


This riveting story, part sociopolitical thriller and part
love story, lyrically told, marks the culmination of the copious research and
drafting which I began in 2009, and relied on the support of several writers’
colonies to complete, including Yaddo, Ragdale, the Virginia Center for the
Creative Arts, and others. 
After so many years of working on the project, I am
ecstatic that Juventud has found a
home with the Chicago-based independent press, Curbside Splendor Publishing, and
I am committed to bringing the novel to the widest audience possible upon its
release this fall.  In the Northeast I am
scheduled to present at the Burlington Book Festival, the Fall for the Book in
Fairfax, VA, then will head to launch events in Chicago and Minneapolis, Boston
and NYC. In November, the tour heads south and will include my home state of
Florida, Savannah, Charleston, Charlotte, Nashville, and D.C. 




Why I Need Your Support
I need your help and support to cover travel expenses,
lodging, and meals from when the launch starts at the end of September to early
December, when I will be on leave from my part-time job at Bookmark It in
Orlando, FL. While the publisher is arranging the tour, they are not funding it. My only source of income during the fall will be the online
fiction workshop I’m teaching for UCF, which will allow me to maintain
flexibility but will amount to a small paycheck that will just cover monthly
essentials. 

I have a variety of donation levels and incentives to offer
– but of course you may donate any amount you wish! I sincerely thank you for
being a part of bringing this stunning and important novel—the first of many, I
hope—into the world. Further information can be found on the press release and
in my biography, provided here, as well as on my website, www.vanessablakeslee.com.

<p>There are presently close to 4 million Syrian refugees in
Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and the surrounding nations. Most of these have lost
homes, businesses, possessions and even family members as they were forced to
flee for their very lives. Many of these people are victims of terrorism and
have suffered in ways that I can never hope to comprehend. These precious
people need basic life necessities that we so easily take for granted: food,
clean water, shelter, clothing, medicine, education and much more. The need is
far too great for humanitarian or government agencies to tackle on their own
and the daily events of world news indicate that this humanitarian crisis will
only increase over the coming years. </p>

Since a very young age I've been fascinated about the miracles of life. This curiosity led me to study a lot of different fields of knowledge in order to better understand how we came to exist as human beings on this floating ball of water around a star... It's nothing less than wonderful! 
After diving in scientific, holistic and esoteric studies and following a path of self awareness and healing, I finally discovered Ayurveda, the Ancient Medicine of India which I've been studying for the past years.

<p>I started sailing
at 10 years old in the Laser Radial class and quickly progressed to racing in
this particular class in Antigua.   I have  attended 17 sailing regattas in the
last 2-3 years; International, Regional and Local events spanning countries as
far afield as Martinique, USA, Canada and Guadeloupe and Malaysia having competed in 4 international regattas in the last year.  I am  one of the top youth sailors
representing Antigua &amp; Barbuda today and in my bid to make it to the 2020 Olympics, I will have to attend a lot more, which is an expensive undertaking.<br/></p>
<p>I have raised some money and have managed to pay for my registration, Laser charter and damage deposit, but I still have to raise the airfare, pre-regatta boat charter fee, accommodation and food, coach, coach boat and related expenses and the cost of special gear for sailing in cold temperatures, as I am used sailing in 84F temperatures.  I have had a successful year so far and feel confident that will do well in Ireland if I can raise the funds to get there.  I competed in the same event last year in Canada and know the level of competition to expect</p>
<p>I cannot compete at this level internationally without help and support, both financially and otherwise.  Please support my cause by donating and/or sharing this campaign on all of your social media and by email to all of your contacts.  If you know me, you can tell your contacts about me and raise some more support.  Thank you for all your support on previous campaigns and for any and all of your support on this one.  </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Hi to everyone.  I am Jules Mitchell, 17 year old Antiguan youth sailor.  I have a dream to get to the 2020 Olympics and race Laser for my country, Antigua.  As part of my quest, I have to compete in local, regional and international regattas, and my next regatta is the KBC Laser Radial Youth World Championships in  Dun Laoghraire, Ireland this July. 
I started sailing
at 10 years old in the Laser Radial class and quickly progressed to racing in
this particular class in Antigua.   I have  attended 17 sailing regattas in the
last 2-3 years; International, Regional and Local events spanning countries as
far afield as Martinique, USA, Canada and Guadeloupe and Malaysia having competed in 4 international regattas in the last year.  I am  one of the top youth sailors
representing Antigua & Barbuda today and in my bid to make it to the 2020 Olympics, I will have to attend a lot more, which is an expensive undertaking.
I have raised some money and have managed to pay for my registration, Laser charter and damage deposit, but I still have to raise the airfare, pre-regatta boat charter fee, accommodation and food, coach, coach boat and related expenses and the cost of special gear for sailing in cold temperatures, as I am used sailing in 84F temperatures.  I have had a successful year so far and feel confident that will do well in Ireland if I can raise the funds to get there.  I competed in the same event last year in Canada and know the level of competition to expect
I cannot compete at this level internationally without help and support, both financially and otherwise.  Please support my cause by donating and/or sharing this campaign on all of your social media and by email to all of your contacts.  If you know me, you can tell your contacts about me and raise some more support.  Thank you for all your support on previous campaigns and for any and all of your support on this one.  
What We Need & What You Get

The Impact This regatta is very important in the campaign to get to the 2020 Olympics because it is a World Championship where the competition is very high cailbre and it is regattas like this that make an Olympic class sailor.  Last year, I took part in the same regatta which was held in Canada, my first competition at this level.  I came 9th in my fleet.  I know I will do better this year after competing in the ISAF Worlds in Malaysia.  I am training hard everyday and working on my strength, endurance, and tactics as it take a lot of work to maintain my physical condition and stamina. I only have one more year at this level of competition.  If my fundraising is successful, and I can compete at the Laser Radial Youth Worlds in Dun Laoghraire, Irleland, I am one step closer to my goal.   Risks & Challenges No matter how much work I put in to my physical performance, I still have to find a way to fund attending world championships.  Once I have paid for the registration, there is no turning back or I can lose all or some of the money.  Working hard at my training is a good part of the battle to get support.  When I do well, people can see that my hard work pays off and may be more inclined to support me.  I know that I am getting  bigger and stronger all of the time and I am persistent and consistent with my training to be the best that I can be.  With the help of my mother, fundraising is always a priority and we have a raffle, a regatta and other events planned along with this Indiegogo campaign.

I've been doing freelance creative work for over 8 years now, taking the leap into writing in 2012. I have sense published 3 short stories and have multiple other projects in the works. </p>
<p>""When Color Came"" is a book project 2 years in the making. When I originally wrote and illustrated this story, it was rejected by a few publishers and printers. I've taken their notes and have revised and revived this piece into the beautiful book it is today.</p>
<p>I have spent the past two years enhancing the story and redesigning the illustrations and the result is a captivating journey into a land of color and adventure. The illustrations are all hand drawn and hand painted, each showcasing a brilliant attention to detail. The colors are bright and vivid and the words guide you through a well crafted world of imagination. </p>
<p>After all this time working on it, I am so happy to finally be releasing this story to those who love adventure. This campaign does double duty in allowing you the fans to pre-order the book and also to donate towards the publication of this book. Indiegogo is a great company for this because it allows me to track and manage my orders and complete them all at the same time.

</div></div>","Short Summary Hello everyone! I'm Andrew Pan, an illustrator, writer and photographer from North Carolina. I've been doing freelance creative work for over 8 years now, taking the leap into writing in 2012. I have sense published 3 short stories and have multiple other projects in the works. 
""When Color Came"" is a book project 2 years in the making. When I originally wrote and illustrated this story, it was rejected by a few publishers and printers. I've taken their notes and have revised and revived this piece into the beautiful book it is today.
I have spent the past two years enhancing the story and redesigning the illustrations and the result is a captivating journey into a land of color and adventure. The illustrations are all hand drawn and hand painted, each showcasing a brilliant attention to detail. The colors are bright and vivid and the words guide you through a well crafted world of imagination. 
After all this time working on it, I am so happy to finally be releasing this story to those who love adventure. This campaign does double duty in allowing you the fans to pre-order the book and also to donate towards the publication of this book. Indiegogo is a great company for this because it allows me to track and manage my orders and complete them all at the same time. The goal is to have enough people preorder the book that once the campaign is over, I would be able to donate some books to local schools and libraries. This would give my book not only a broader reach but also an opportunity to touch more lives.   What We Need & What You Get The set goal is $1,000. Although this goal is set as the maximum, it is flexible! The money used if the goal is met goes directly to completing orders that you have placed and also to the publication of this and other works. If the entire goal isn't met, thats ok too! The money that is collected would still go to fulfilling orders and the publication of as many books as I can manage.

Instead of trying to tackle something all at once, the idea here is to start small and grow.$13,200 may not seem that small, but it's paying for one full time employee to work 1-4 shifts a week in a restaurant (for free) over a period of six months, write the content, organize and coordinate the site all while maintaining another part time job to cover living expenses. It also funds purchases necessary to working in multiple restaurants in multiple rolls. While it won't cover expansive photography, it will cover a few high quality photo essays, and I'm hopping to hire this photographer. The money also pays for expertise when it come to expanding and polishing the small website currently set up at The Restaurant Junkie. Lastly about 18% of the final total raised will also go towards rewards and fees associated with using IndieGoGo.APPROXIMATE BREAKDOWN:




$3,000: Six months of subsidized Rent/Utilities/Living Expenses.


$950: Work supplies. Uniforms, knife maintenance, shoes, etc.

$1,250: Basic website design, domain, and more.


$4,000: Photography. I actually want to spend more here. While it may seem high, it's worth it for quality.

$2,000: Food. Divided into two parts, approximately $1,200 is earmarked for eating at restaurants, and $800 is for cooking at home, recipe testing (for the ""untitled cookbook"" in the rewards section), and food product reviews.

$1000: Rewards. Postage, shipping supplies, the goods.


$500 - $1000: Approximate Fees. Indiegogo's taste.

If we can reach this goal, great! If we can surpass it, I have a series of stretch goals that would allow for work in more restaurants, hiring additional creative contributors, taking more pictures, and adding more rewards... but let's make some soup before we think about nuts.Benefits For All

""Restaurants today lie at the heart of 21st-century American life. These employers aren’t headed overseas; for the foreseeable future, millions of Americans will wait tables, cook food, or wash dishes for their livelihoods."" - Boston Globe Editorial, 12/29/14If you eat at restaurants, funding this project will give you a peak behind the curtain and make you smarter about where and how you eat. If you work in restaurants at the very least you'll get a laugh and you may get some insight into your work. If you run a Boston area restaurant this will give you the opportunity to option some free labor. If you're a home cook this project will offer you tips on preping for your next big gathering. And, if you're considering getting involved in restaurants -- even a little -- this project will help you to know if you genuinely are a ""restaurant junkie.""",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

Thank you for all of your support in advance! Here's what people are saying about my work.""Robin saved my mind. There is no other way to say it. After seeing medical doctors who wanted to treat my anxiety and emotions with medicine, which made me feel even worse, I went into a health food store and was given Robin's card and  told to ""just call her"". The second I heard Robin's voice my anxiety dropped. She didn't judge me for anything I confided in her. She taught me to connect my mind to my body and understand how they interact. No mainstream doctor ever talked to me about this or taught me about this valuable tool. To have any of her wisdom accessible in book form would be a blessing to this world  Please help Robin get published!"" -  Deirdre McKenna""I had been very sick with a digestive ailment for 23 years. Top medical specialists in New York, Boston, San Francisco, and Baltimore concluded that it was a genetic condition and nothing could be done. I became so debilitated both physically and emotionally that I didn't know who I was anymore. Thanks to Robin's extraordinary gifts, I am healthy and happy today in ways I never imagined I could be. She helped me understand the emotional origins of my illness, unlocking a powerful process that healed my body and ultimately strengthened my family relationships and even my professional life. Let's help Robin get her book published so that others can be healed and empowered as I was."" - Deborah Smith""Robin was one of my key resources in overcoming a serious illness in 2015. No mean feat considering I was in Australia and Robin lives in the US. Having a tumor means being tossed and turned through a bewildering array of information from expert medical advice, Google searches, test results, books and the opinions of friends, family, colleagues and ""taxi drivers"". Robin helped me enormously by coaching me on how to listen to myself to choose the optimal treatment protocol from my shortlist. Doing nothing was not an option. The result was replacing overwhelm with a peace of mind and confidence that allowed me to simply focus on the treatment.  Robin was a godsend and I can't wait to read her book."" - Derek B (Sydney and Los Angeles)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In honour of Canada’s 150<sup>th</sup> birthday, Bundoran Press Publishing House will publish an anthology of short science fiction next year, entitled 49<sup>th</sup> Parallels: Alternative Canadian Histories and Futures. Stories will be sought from across Canada and around the world exploring what might have been – or what might yet be. The anthology will be edited by two-time Aurora winning editor, Hayden Trenholm.</p>
<p>“In 1904, Prime Minister Wilfred Laurier said ‘The 20th Century will be the Century of Canada’” said Trenholm, “and while it didn’t quite work out that way, it is easy to imagine how it could have or how the next century still might be. I look forward to seeing how both Canadian and non-Canadian writers explore this question.”</p>
<p>An all original anthology, which, if we meet our goal will pay at least 6 cents (Canadian) a word, 49th Parallels will follow on the heels of our previous four successful anthologies:</p>
<p>Blood and Water (2012) – an anthology of near future resource conflicts, Winner of the Aurora Award</p>
<p>Strange Bedfellows (2014) – an anthology of political science fiction, Aurora Award nominee, and</p>
<p>Second Contacts (2015) – stories set 50 years after First Contact. Winner of the Aurora Award.</p>
<p>Lazarus Risen (2016) -- stories of immortality and the biological singularity</p>
<p>Like Strange Bedfellows, this anthology will be edited by Hayden Trenholm, a four-time novelist and  an Aurora Award winning  short fiction writer and editor. We expect the anthology will be 85000-90000 words of original fiction. Though we expect this anthology may be of greatest interest to Canadian writers, we will be open to submissions to authors from around the world. There is, after all, no greater gift than to see yourself as others see you. Expected publication: October 2017</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>You'll be helping us pay writers to create stories that might otherwise never have been written and how cool is that?</p>
<p>49th Parallels will turn a science fiction lens on Canada's past and its future in the world. The focus will be on scientific and technological changes but we're also keen on seeing how things might have turned out -- or might still turn out -- if economics or politics had taken a different turn. And why stop at Canada's borders? How would this large but sparsely populated nation have developed if the history of America, England, Russia or China had been dramatically different? The best thing about themed anthologies is discovering the magic good writers bring to the theme.</p>
<p>Our Perks</p>
<p>Contributors will get our thanks and recognition in the Acknowledgements as well as e-books, books (lots of books), Bundoran Press souvenirs, writing advice and critiquing from our editors, signed posters of cover art,  </p>
<p>What Happens If We Don't Reach Our Goal?</p>
<p>This is a flexible campaign and if we don't make our goal, the book will still appear with all funds raised going to paying writers. But, without our target amount, the pay rate will be lower. Help writers get paid a decent wage! </p>
<p>Two years ago, we ran a campaign for Second Contacts. We didn't reach our fixed goal (and so none of the money) but we published the anthology anyway. Last year we only made part of our goal but directed all of the funds toward paying writers and Lazarus Risen was born. Because that's what we've been doing at Bundoran Press  for the last nine years -- making good books.</p>
<p>And, if we raise more than our goal?</p>
<p>Stretch Goals</p>
<p>The first $1000 raised beyond our goal will be used to further increase the anthology length beyond 90000 words.</p>
<p>Additional funds will further increase the pay rates UNLESS…</p>
<p>Super Stretch Goal</p>
<p>If we raise another $3600 – that is, $9000 total – we will publish a second anthology – starting at four cents a word and rising from there.</p>
<p>LIBERTY HALL</p>
<p>“This is Liberty Hall. You can spit on the mat and call the cat a bastard.” – A. Bertram Chandler</p>
<p>An anthology of Space Opera where anything goes – as long as the story is entertaining and thought-provoking. Want a story with a white male engineer as the hero? Go right ahead. Prefer gender-bending aliens in a communist space station? Sounds perfect. Left wing, right wing, no wings at all? Love it. Libertarian, authoritarian, democratic or group mind – if you can do it, we might publish it. Provided it’s a great story. Politics in service of a story – we don’t mind. Stories in service to your politics – keep them to yourself. Expected publication: Spring 2018</p>
<p>If we are able to publish a second anthology from this campaign, all those eligible to receive an e-book or print book will get a copy of the second anthology as well.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>

Ukraine has been my adopted home for 14 years and in that time I have learned to respect and admire much about the country and the people of the country.</p><p> </p><p>I understood the reasons why the Revolution of Dignity, originally called EuroMaidan, started.

I witnessed the Orange Revolution in 2004/5 also. Ukraine has been my adopted home for 14 years and in that time I have learned to respect and admire much about the country and the people of the country. I understood the reasons why the Revolution of Dignity, originally called EuroMaidan, started. With the Maidan Square being just a short walk away from both my office and my home I found the allure of witnessing history impossible to resist and so I was on Maidan almost every day throughout the 93 days of struggle against the cruel and corrupt Yanukovych regime. I stood there when Maidan was jubilant, and I stood there when Maidan mourned. During this period ordinary men and women, young and old, became heroes. They stood firm in the face of relentless pressure resulting from the dirty tricks of the incumbent regime. As the revolution wore on that regime lost all legitimacy, not only were they illegitimate because of the mass looting of state resources that led to the revolution, but their illegitimacy was compounded throughout the revolution by the abduction, torture, and murder of activists and the tactic to throw hordes of violent thugs on the streets of Kyiv to intimidate protesters. This is only part of the story.  About The Author Since the end of the revolution I have written close to 50 articles about Ukraine and events affecting Ukraine. My writing has been published in the Kyiv Post, Novya Vremya Magazine, Business Ukraine magazine and by the Washington, D.C. think tank The Atlantic Council. Some of my articles have covered certain elements of the revolution, but with this book I intend to deliver the most complete chronicle of the revolution yet published. This is a story worthy of understanding because these events in Ukraine will help shape the future of the entire post-Soviet space, and for this reason there has been a concerted attempt to discredit the revolution. I intend to set the record straight, and do so in memory of those who gave their lives fighting for justice, freedom, and for the basic human rights the authorities of the time tried to deny them on many occasions throughout this period. Much of the material for this book is already written, during the revolution I collected many photographs and shared many articles explaining events in Ukraine at that time. This book will contain many of them, and tell one of the most important stories of modern times, with my own commentary, in real time as it unfolded.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

The most solid East-End lass you’ve ever met agreed to see me. She wrote the scripts, and made a space for me as her last patient every Tuesday thereafter at 8.30pm just because ""<i>I’m worried about you, love</i>”, letting me pour my heart out for as long as I wanted (which was not very long, because I was too anxious to get back from my work ‘dinner break'). God save the NHS!</p><p>But then, after the three darkest months of my life (which, considering the nature of the years that preceded it, I think is really saying something), most of which was spent in the Panopticon-like prison of my shared office, the sun came out on a crisp May morning in London Fields, where the wildflowers were already in bloom, to illuminate the true nature of the events of that bitterly cold March. It became abundantly clear that what that year’s 'breakdown' had signified was that the throbbing intuitive organ buried deep inside of me, which had either been neglected, medically straightjacketed or downright abused for most my life, had suddenly found itself an open stage and an uncovered microphone, and sensing the immense danger that lay ahead and in one final attempt to make itself heard, had yelled with all its might. And because at the time, I hadn’t yet learned to listen to my intuition even when it was speaking at a normal volume, now that it was screaming like a raving lunatic could only make out:</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!??!!!????!!!!!?????!!??!!!!!!&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;##@@##$$$&amp;(+[“;/@#$%!!###$%%^&amp;&amp;&amp;^%$%$!!!@@@@:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(</i></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>▄︻̷̿┻̿═━一    ▄︻̷̿┻̿═━一</i>     </p><p>            And because most of my life I had been conditioned to believe that any overly-emotional or seemingly self-sabotaging behaviour I had ever exhibited was attributable to a horrible, incurable mental illness (whether that be homosexuality or ‘bipolar disorder’), I was of course completely freaked out by this sudden, 24/7 unstoppable screaming. I never questioned whether something could actually be wrong <i>outside</i> of my head. As far I was concerned, a lifelong, incurable disease had just ‘flared up’ again. And I took what I thought was the sensible, responsible course of action, which was to not tell anyone, to keep calm, and seek medical attention. I didn’t miss a single day of work despite my ‘utilisation’ continuing to exceed 120% for my first couple of months (just so non-lawyers understand how horrific a figure that is, 120% utilisation means 12 hours of billable work recorded per day, which requires at least 16 hours to actually be spent in the office, every day). I was too scared (and too busy) to tell anyone in Australia about my 'relapse', which fortunately meant that there wasn’t an opportunity for my family to corroborate my self-diagnosis, and panic me further, and tell me how I had to immediately return home to go straight into a psychiatric clinic. Although it was horrendously lonely, just sitting in that office dealing with all of it on my own gave my slow-on-the-uptake 'conscious mind' the time it needed in the corporate trenches (where, though over 100% of my time was required, only about 7% of intellectual capacity was needed for the monkey work I was actually doing) to work out that I hadn’t been ill at all (or at least not before I made myself so) and that my instinctive reaction of revulsion had been entirely rational and justified. It took all that time for my supposedly terrifically clever brain to work out what had taken my intuition only a matter of minutes, and to properly decipher the message that had almost been mistranslated as a command to commit a tragic and irreversible act, a message that actually was instructing the rest of me to:</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>GET OUT! GET OUT NOW! GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN! GO! GO NOW! DO NOT PASS ‘GO’, DO NOT COLLECT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS! JUST GET OUT OF HERE! THIS IS NOT A GOOD PLACE! THIS IS AZKABAN! LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE!!! THEY ARE DEATH EATERS!! THIS IS YOUR SOUL SPEAKING AND I DO NOT WANT TO BE EATEN!! What are you doing there on the edge of that bed? What are those – deep breathing exercise? Do you think you’ve become immune to anxiety-triggered insomnia just because you’ve been doing yoga for a year? FUCK YOGA – JUST LISTEN TO ME!!! I KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON HERE, WHEREAS YOU CLEARLY NEVER HAVE AND NEVER WILL! I’ve been trying to keep you away from this place anyway I could for the past five years, but now that you’ve finally gone and stuck your nose right up to the abyss, I’m just going to have to bring out every piece of heavy artillery at my disposal to stop you falling in. I’M NOT GOING TO LET YOU SLEEP! NO SLEEP!! NO WAY, JOSE! You can sleep as much as you want once you are the hell away from this giant corporate incinerator that will swallow you up into its squalid belly and spit you out into another contract laying machine like the rows of suited battery hens rotting in their glass cages just outside your bedroom window! Just go take another look if you need proof. See what I mean? LOOK AT THEM!! Look at that forty year-old hag in a crinkled Marks and Spencer blazer almost collapsing onto her keyboard. Do you know how old she actually is? TWENTY-SEVEN!!! She was probably also a starry-eyed hot shot from somewhere nice and sunny when she arrived at the ‘magic circle’ three years ago. And just look at her now! THAT’S MAGIC FOR YOU!!!! Do you want to be that hag in three years? NO! THE ANSWER IS NO! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, CHOOSE LIFE! ACTUAL LIFE, NOT TRAINSPOTTING-IRONIC-LIFE!

Rowling or Danny Boyle allusions – there will only be middle to highbrow literary allusions in the novel). But somehow, even once I had decoded this exceptionally clear, direct message from my gut, I managed to rationalise myself out of listening to it immediately. I made a long list of reasons for staying at the job even though I knew it was making me miserable, the least romantic of which was that I would have owed the firm a whole heap of money from all the strings-attached sweeteners they had offered when they still thought they needed to woe me over from paradise (sweeteners which soon after being greedily gulped down left a too-good-to-be-true, sick-to-my-stomach aftertaste that now makes complete sense). Other reasons for staying included ‘not wanting to be a quitter’, not quite being ready to walk away from such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity (please God, let it have just been once!!), and desperately not wanting to go back to Australia for reasons that only became clear when I was eventually forced to return. Despite having felt like I was lucky to have got through those three months in London alive, Australia still seemed like an even greater hell and one that I had only just escaped from. So I conjured up an extraordinarily fanciful plan, one borne out of sheer desperation and perhaps fuelled by the close-to-hypomanic state in which I may or may not have been at the time (who will ever know?) The plan was to keep participating in the Hunger Games of the City of London, but to start making everyone else start playing according to my own rules. And I’d do this by reconstructing the remainder of my Training Contract as being a ‘field research mission’ (from which I could walk away at any time) for the revolutionary novel I was going to write at the end, one which was going to be so inspiring and widely read that it was going to turn the sordid, sequestered world of corporate law inside out. I thus reimagined the experience through which I was only an eighth of the way from being an introduction to a lifelong career in which I was inevitably going to be found dead at my desk, to being a thrilling escapade of espionage, and a noble sacrifice of a small chunk of my precious youth for the sake of the betterment of humankind.""</p></div>","THIS CAMPAIGN HAS CLOSED...BUT THERE IS A NEW ONE!

<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>My name is Melica Niccole and I would like to tell you about my children's book called Naturals: The Paper People. This book  was created as a tribute for kids and people with natural hair, to showcase that people of different ages and genders can have natural hair. The book is about Zee Baby300 who is 3 years old. Zee Baby300 introduces the audience to her family, friends, and famous people who have natural hair. The images in the book includes: Zee Baby300, her family, Solange, Nina Simone, and more. This book is an important topic to tackle because it allows children to understand their hair and to start questions questions, such as: Why do I have curly hair? Why do I have straight hair? What different things can I do with my hair? What is natural hair?</p>
<p>So I know you are asking yourself, what is my role in the project and where is the funding going? Your contribution will be used to create 200 books on CD, which includes creation of the CDs, packaging, and marketing. Creation and packing will cost about $5-$10 per CD. In regards to marketing, various avenues will be used, such as Ads on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other marketing methods. Marketing for this project will cost between $200 - $300. Helping to fund Naturals: The Paper People (Children's Book on CD) will allow you to fund a child based project that was created for the sole purpose of creating different techniques for reading. </p>

This book is an important topic to tackle because it allows children to understand their hair and to start questions questions, such as: Why do I have curly hair? Why do I have straight hair? What different things can I do with my hair? What is natural hair?
So I know you are asking yourself, what is my role in the project and where is the funding going? Your contribution will be used to create 200 books on CD, which includes creation of the CDs, packaging, and marketing. Creation and packing will cost about $5-$10 per CD. In regards to marketing, various avenues will be used, such as Ads on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other marketing methods. Marketing for this project will cost between $200 - $300. Helping to fund Naturals: The Paper People (Children's Book on CD) will allow you to fund a child based project that was created for the sole purpose of creating different techniques for reading.

Why Is Your Contribution Important?
You contribution is important because you have an opportunity in assisting in distributing an amazing project that can be incorporated in schools, after-school programs, community based programs, and other services catering to children. Let's work together in helping children listen to stories read by other children. 

Risks & Challenges
Potential risks and challenges in obtaining $1500: 

Entering the holiday season many families may be on limited incomes due to previously purchased items. I can work on marketing this project as a way to start early shopping for birthdays and the holiday season for 2017. 
Getting individuals to buy into your project. I will continuously market items on website and social media networks. I will also use a Children's Book Festival platform that was developed by Hampton Publishing House, LLC and ADC Kid.
Not getting all the money needed for the project. In the event that the project raises less than requested, I will look into other avenues to get things done. This includes marketing by using free services and at various book festivals.

Credem cu tărie că partipând la proiecte de scriere si creativitate, ei își vor putea dezvolta creativitatea și stima de sine.Promoveaza empatia si acceptarea diferențelor culturaleUneori poveștile ne ajută să creștem mai puternici și mai generoși, ele fiind instrumente puternice pentru dezvoltarea toleranței și a empatiei față de cei din jur. Integrarea și punerea în valoare a copiilor, și în general a persoanelor din grupurile minoritare etnice, nu face deocamdata parte, din păcate, din prioritățile sistemului de învățământ românesc. Considerăm că societatea noastra ar fi mai puternică și mai bogată daca am merge in direcția aceasta, iar proiectul nostru este un pas înainte către acest obiectiv.Sensibilizează opinia publică în ceea ce privește reprezentarea diversității în RomâniaCartea care va rezulta va fi una din puținele cărți pentru copii cu personaje atât rome cât si re-rome, publicată vreodată în lume. Sperăm că prin aceasta carte vom atrage atenția asupra importanței de a reprezenta realități diferite în poveștile din țara noastră, și că va fi una dintre multele carți de acest fel care vor urma.Aduce impreuna doua indragite autoareAdina Rosetti si Irina Dobrescu sunt printre cele mai indragite autoare de literatura pentru copii din Romania. Ele fac parte din noul val al literaturii pentru copii care a aparut in Romania in ultimii zece ani.Adina este o îndrăgită scriitoare de literatură pentru adulți și copii. A scris Domnișoara Poimâine și  joaca de-a Timpul, selectată în catalogul “The White Ravens”, cu cele mai frumoase 200 cărți pentru copii din lume, lansat în cadrul Târgului internațional de carte de la Frankfurt 2015. Cea mai recentă apariție este De ce zboară vrăjitoarele pe cozi de mătură (și alte 10 intrebări fantastice). A câștigat mai multe premii literare naționale și colaborează ca jurnalistă cu numeroase publicații.Irina este o binecunoscută ilustratoare de cărţi pentru copii şi una dintre rarele artiste de bandă desenată din România. A studiat la Universitatea Naţională de Arte din Bucureşti până în 2003 şi este cofondatoarea Clubului Ilustratorilor din România. A ilustrat numeroase cărţi pentru copii şi a câştigat Premiul Arthur în 2014 pentru Povestea unui lup jucător de poker, pe care a scris-o şi ilustrat-o.Cine suntem?Noii Povestitori este primul proiect al asociației Cu Alte Cuvinte, un ONG care își propune să promoveze diversitatea în literatura pentru copii din România. Echipa noastră crede că autorii români trebuie să creeze artă și literatură dincolo de stereotipuri și să aducă în cărțile lor personaje care să-i reprezinte și pe romi, unul dintre cele mai mari grupuri etnice minoritare din România.Partenerul nostru principal în cadrul acestui proiect este Clubul de Educație Alternativa al Policy Center for Roma and Minorities, un program non-formal care organizează activități de educație remedială și de mentorat pentru peste 200 de copii din Ferentari. Suntem parteneri si cu Global Shapers Bucharest Hub.Va invităm să ne fiți alături în această călătorie umană și literară care să facă posibilă scrierea unor povești în general nespuse!De ce avem nevoieAvem nevoie de ajutorul vostru pentru:- a susține autorii să lucreze la acest proiect:Adina si Irina vor petrece două luni cu povestitorii noștri, în cadrul a douăsprezece ateliere de storytelling. Copiii vor crea povești prin jocuri creative, desene, înregistrări scurte și scriere.Atelierele au două obiective principale: pe de-o parte, le vor permite să se inspire din poveștile copiilor pentru scrierea și ilustrarea cărții; de de altă parte, aceste întâlniri între copii și cele două autoare le va dezvolta creativitatea și aptitudinile de povestitori.Mai mult decat atât, autorii se vor întâlni cu diverși membri ai comunității din Ferentari pentru a înțelege cât mai bine provocările comunității. Vor petrece între patru și sase luni să scrie și să ilustreze cartea inspirată din poveștile copiilor.Pentru a le susține de-a lungul acestui proces, le vom oferi granturi de creație.- a organiza atelierele cu copiii din punct de vedere logistic:Le vom oferi micilor povestitori rechizite și gustări sănătoase.- pentru a printa primele 500 de exemplare ale cărții și a le distribui gratuit în bibliotecile școlilor din comunitate și în diverse ONG-uri.Cheltuielile noastre vor fi împărțite în felul următor:Buget de implementare : 10.500$30% - grant pentru scriitor (ateliere, documentare și manuscrisul cărții)30% - grant pentru ilustrator (ateliere, cercetare și ilustrarea cărții)15% - printul și publicarea a 500 de exemplare10% - organizarea logistică pentru atelierele cu copiii10% - muncă administrativă5% - taxa IndiegogoConsultă aici un buget mai detaliat.Ce îți oferimAm pregătit o mulțime de cadouri pe care le vom dărui celor ce se îmbarcă alături de noi în această călătorie creativă:Cartea tipărităVom trimite cartea ilustrată oriunde în lume. In funcție de interesul manifestat, vom încerca să creăm și versiunea în limba engleză a cărții.Un ghid pedagogic cu activități  ludice inspirate din carteEști părinte sau profesor? Vei primi ghidul nostru pedagogic, cu activități ludice inspirate din cartea noilor povestitori și concepute de echipa noastră.Semne de carte ilustrateSemnele de carte vor fi printate cu un desen pe care îl vei alege chiar tu din ilustrațiile cartii.Sacoșe cu imprimeuSacoșele vor fi imprimate cu o ilustrație pe care o vei alege chiar tu din ilustrațiile cartii.Certificate de donator Vei primi un certificat personalizat, decorat cu ilustrația ta preferată.Impactul donației taleDonând pentru Noii Povestitori:-    contribui la crearea uneia dintre puținele cărți pentru copii din lume ce pune în scenă atât personaje rome dar și ne-rome;-    contribui la crearea unor eroi puternici și pozitivi cu care copiii romi se vor putea identifica și deci indirect la o incluziune sociala mai reușita a acestor copii;-    contribui la publicarea unui nou instrument pedagogic: cartea noastră, alături de ghidul pedagogic, vor putea fi folosite atât de educatori cât și de părinți;-    ne ajuți să facem un prim pas greu — o primă carte tipărită înseamnă un precedent fericit pentru proiectul Noii Povestitori și o șansă mai bună în a găsi finanțări pentru volumele urmatoare. Ne ajuți să promovăm diversitatea culturală în cărți, ilustrații și mass-media.Alte modalități prin care ne poți ajutaTe rugăm să dai informația mai departe, transmițând campania noastră atât familiei, prietenilor și colegilor tăi dar și celor din jurul tău  care sunt sensibili la cauza noastra și își doresc să ne susțină financiar. © Irina Dobrescu",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Images of America: The San Geronimo Valley</h2>
<p>Hello Friends and Neighbors,</p>
<p>Did you know that the first telephone line in California was installed by Alexander Graham Bell himself on the Maillard ranch in Woodacre? That after the Mexican rancho system dissolved, Paul Revere's grandson Joseph Revere owned the land we now live on? The Valley has a rich past, and it is time for it to be documented! Now, with a publishing agreement from <a href=""http://www.arcadiapublishing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Arcadia Publishing</a>, I have the chance to write a local history book that does just that.</p>
<p>A bit about myself. My name is Owen Clapp - I was born in New York City, but moved with my family to Woodacre in 1993. Growing up here was a magical experience, and I've developed a very deep love for, and connection to, this area. My fondest memories are of playing in the creeks and hills of Woodacre and Lagunitas, the playground at West Marin Montessori, the multipurpose room at Lagunitas School. Since high school I've dreamed about creating a book that tells the unique story of the people and events that make the Valley what it is.</p>
<p>In December I moved back to Woodacre after almost eight years in Los Angeles, where I studied music and anthropology at UCLA, and began a career as a professional musician. Those eight years in L.A., and having traveled around the world as a musician, inform my perspective that the Valley is a truly special place. Now that I am back home, this is the perfect moment to dedicate my time and energy to this project that I am so passionate about.</p>
<p>The funds from this campaign are essential, as Arcadia Publishing does not provide any sort of advance or stipend for their authors. Those funds will help me cover the time and expenses that go into the research and writing stages of this book.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>A well funded campaign will ensure that this book is of the highest possible quality that it can be!</span></p>

You do not need to be a professional writer or artist to submit to Crux. We want the full spectrum of experience, and realize not everybody has access to the money or education necessary to become a successful writer or artist. There are so many amazing stories out there just waiting to be told, and we want to find them and share them through Crux.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, things didn't quite work out.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Cowmageddon (a.k.a. Udder Destruction)</h3>
<p>About 18 months ago my 60 beehives (~2.5 million bees) were destroyed by a heard of hungry cows after they had been winterized.  The field where they stood looked like a trailer park after a tornado.  It took two full days, four people, and two trips to the dump to clean up.  Needless to say, it was a rough time both emotionally and financially.   </p>
<p>Fortunately, there were enough undamaged parts that I can put together 10 hives as the top tier perk.  Even though my 60 hives have been reduced to one in my mother's backyard, this book is a way for me to stay involved and contribute in another way.  That's very exciting to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462232316/14938872750_705626ba26_o_kqe6yg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Rise of the Beekeepers</span></h3>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">During the last couple of years I've come across an amazingly diverse group of wonderful people who share this passion of mine.   I could've never imagined I would connect with people in Canada, France, Sweden, Iran (a lot of Iranians! WOW!), Kuwait, Spain and all parts of the USA.   We come from varying backgrounds, but we share the same passion.  It's an amazing thing!  The inspiration for this book came from seeing their incredible Instagram posts.  A lot of people are doing <i>great</i> things.</span><br/></p>
<p>So, I thought it would be neat to write a book about the culture of beekeeping in America, starting with the Reverand L.L. Langstroth (widely regarded as the father of modern beekeping) up through today.  There are plenty of great books about how to become a beekeeper, but I'm interested in writing about the people with bees in their blood; their backgrounds, their hives, their honey, their businesses and festivals.   Beekeeping is much more than a hobby - it's a <i>lifestyle</i>.  Beekeepers work tirelessly and selflessly and I want to tell those stories to inspire you.  It'll be part coffee table book, part oral history, part biography, part how-to.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The book will also include practical tips for getting started.  I want to demystify the process, explain the lexicon, and show you just how simple and rewarding it really it is.  There's nothing like cracking open a hive and pulling out frame full of honey that your bees made.  It will contain a directory of all the local honey producers, pollinators and beekeeping clubs and associations I can find.  I believe in supporting our local businesses and buying local honey.</span></p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">This is so important because our bee colonies are in danger.  Every year colonies are dying at alarming rates.   Bees pollinate about 80% of our insect crops - our vegetables, berries, nuts, beans, fruits, and herbs.  Now more than ever we need new beekeepers.   My primary goal for this book is to inspire YOU to take up this hobby. WE NEED YOU!  You'll be welcomed into our community with open arms and hearts.</b></p>
<p></p>

<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I need you.</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>Without my fellow beekeepers, this book can't exist.  <b><i>If you're a beekeeper and would like to be a part of this project, please email me at matt_lohrke@yahoo.com</i></b>.   I would love to hear from you.  I'm interested in writing about all types of beekeepers (city folk, country folk, hipsters, survivalists, everyone!), whether it's a hobby or your business.    I will visit as many of you as possible, but logistics will play a large part of how many people I can actually get to seeing.     </p>

</div></div>","American Beekeeper - The Book Some people buy a car new when they hit their midlife crisis.  Instead, I became a beekeeper.   I'm now in my fourth year and it mesmerizes me just as much today as it did when I started.    I started with one hive that first year and that one eventually became 60.   I had aspirations of commercial beekeeping and I was really excited about it.  
Unfortunately, things didn't quite work out.

Cowmageddon (a.k.a. Udder Destruction)
About 18 months ago my 60 beehives (~2.5 million bees) were destroyed by a heard of hungry cows after they had been winterized.  The field where they stood looked like a trailer park after a tornado.  It took two full days, four people, and two trips to the dump to clean up.  Needless to say, it was a rough time both emotionally and financially.   
Fortunately, there were enough undamaged parts that I can put together 10 hives as the top tier perk.  Even though my 60 hives have been reduced to one in my mother's backyard, this book is a way for me to stay involved and contribute in another way.  That's very exciting to me.


Rise of the Beekeepers
During the last couple of years I've come across an amazingly diverse group of wonderful people who share this passion of mine.   I could've never imagined I would connect with people in Canada, France, Sweden, Iran (a lot of Iranians! WOW!), Kuwait, Spain and all parts of the USA.   We come from varying backgrounds, but we share the same passion.  It's an amazing thing!  The inspiration for this book came from seeing their incredible Instagram posts.  A lot of people are doing great things.
So, I thought it would be neat to write a book about the culture of beekeeping in America, starting with the Reverand L.L. Langstroth (widely regarded as the father of modern beekeping) up through today.  There are plenty of great books about how to become a beekeeper, but I'm interested in writing about the people with bees in their blood; their backgrounds, their hives, their honey, their businesses and festivals.   Beekeeping is much more than a hobby - it's a lifestyle.  Beekeepers work tirelessly and selflessly and I want to tell those stories to inspire you.  It'll be part coffee table book, part oral history, part biography, part how-to.
The book will also include practical tips for getting started.  I want to demystify the process, explain the lexicon, and show you just how simple and rewarding it really it is.  There's nothing like cracking open a hive and pulling out frame full of honey that your bees made.  It will contain a directory of all the local honey producers, pollinators and beekeeping clubs and associations I can find.  I believe in supporting our local businesses and buying local honey.
This is so important because our bee colonies are in danger.  Every year colonies are dying at alarming rates.   Bees pollinate about 80% of our insect crops - our vegetables, berries, nuts, beans, fruits, and herbs.  Now more than ever we need new beekeepers.   My primary goal for this book is to inspire YOU to take up this hobby. WE NEED YOU!  You'll be welcomed into our community with open arms and hearts.

   
I need you.

Without my fellow beekeepers, this book can't exist.  If you're a beekeeper and would like to be a part of this project, please email me at matt_lohrke@yahoo.com.   I would love to hear from you.  I'm interested in writing about all types of beekeepers (city folk, country folk, hipsters, survivalists, everyone!), whether it's a hobby or your business.    I will visit as many of you as possible, but logistics will play a large part of how many people I can actually get to seeing.     


Where's the money go?
The bulk of the $15,000 target goal is for travel over 4-8 weeks, which includes car/hotel rental.   I will bathe in creeks and eat weeds on the side of the road if I have to!  I will make this trip as inexpensive as possible.   The rest will go to rewards outlined on the right, as well as Indiegogo's fees.
10% of all funds raised for this project, as well as 10% of post-campaign book sales, will go directly to a Beginner's Beekeeping Grant.   It's important to me to give back.   I believe we have a duty to do so.  Beekeeping does have its share of start-up costs and this grant will assist those who may not otherwise have the means.




It's a bit scary. I freely admit this is a huge personal challenge for me.  I'm an extreme introvert by nature and the thought of having to put myself out there is terrifying.   Its taken me about six months since I first had this idea to launch this campaign.   So I'm very grateful for your support and encouragement.  It means the world to me.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

<p> In the process of publishing my own book, <strong><i>UNSTOPPABLE  -- Transforming Sickness and Struggle into Triumph, Empowerment and a Celebration of Community</i></strong>, I realized how difficult it can be. I learned that most publishing houses try to control the language, play it ""safe,"" and keep valuable information from the public to protect themselves. This was upsetting. I could not tolerate having my book censored and not be able to be authentic and honest. I was also shocked by the low royalties authors received from a publishing house and how high the upfront costs are to self-publish a book, the line editing, copy editing, design and book cover...it can easily cost over $6000 for a book with no photos.</p>
<p>Then, with Facebook changing their algorithms and fewer and fewer people opening their emails, even people with 500 - 1000 friends on social media are likely to only sell perhaps 100 books...so re-cooping my investment was a major concern. I was sure other authors were experiencing the same frustrations. Perhaps many don't even start writing a book, even though they have valuable information and experiences to share, because the publishing process can seem so daunting.</p>
<p>Then I met a great editor who previously ran a publishing house, very successfully, and is committed to working only with authentic, honest people who have information that will make a difference in the world. We worked so well together that we decided our moms and supporters should also be able to have this kind of support.</p>
<p>So, I am announcing that we are launching Moms Across America Publishing, a division of our nonprofit, so we can support moms and truth-tellers to get honest information to the world with a knowledgeable team. As a nonprofit that values our supporters, we are committed to giving our authors a much larger percentage of royalties as well -- 2 - 3 times more! With our own platform, which currently reaches 1.5 million a month, and our partnerships, we can bring important information to the public without the censoring, challenges and corporate profit-driven business model of the publishing industry.</p>
<p>If you support the work of Moms Across America or if you have never heard of us before, we invite you to support the launch of our publishing house and the launch of our first book: <i><strong>UNSTOPPABLE -- Transforming Sickness and Struggle into Triumph, Empowerment and a Celebration of Community</strong></i>.</p>
<p>If you are tired of seeing information censored, or the spreading of dishonest information, if you love a family member who is sick, if you are fed up with our current food or political system, or if you want to just support new authors share their voice, we welcome your support.</p>

<p>Over the last five years Moms Across America has created an online community reaching hundreds of millions worldwide.  These are people who come together on social media, in chatrooms and in person to share information and experiences with the goal of keeping all our loved ones safe and ultimately transforming the food supply.  Now we are seeking to take our online activism to a new level by publishing books. Books that will take us beyond a 280-character tweet and allow us to hear each other’s stories, learn from each other’s struggles and successes, and make deeper inroads into reaching the masses still unaware of what is actually on their dinner plate.  We want to amplify the voice of the mom and truth tellers who have experiences that will make a difference to improve our world.</p>

<h3>OUR FIRST BOOK….</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519271450/bdnviss9izr1dzrk2g7m.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Our first book, <strong><i>UNSTOPPABLE Transforming Sickness and Struggle into Triumph, Empowerment and a Celebration of Community </i></strong>kicks off our publishing house with a bang.</p>
<p>“When you know better you do better.  Information can save lives.”  So says Zen Honeycutt, founder of Moms Across America, the non-profit whose motto is “Empowered Moms, Healthy Kids.”  Thousands of Moms Across America members, who together reach millions of people worldwide, agree.  </p>
<p><i><strong>UNSTOPPABLE</strong></i> is the story of a mother who learns about the current state of our world food supply and how it affects your dinner table and the health of everyone you love.  In it Zen walks you through her realization of the chemicals we all feed our loved ones, their origin and effects according to top-notch scientists from around the world, and why none of this is necessary according to farmers who not only want to feed the world but nourish it and protect the environment at the same time.  Moms come forward to talk about the chronic and life-threatening health issues of their children, themselves and other family members that were greatly improved once they took matters into their own hands and acted on the truth.  Scientists back up the moms with independent studies and unbiased peer-reviewed papers. Respected journalists, experts, and other activists share their stories of corporate greed and government corruption, all at the expense of our health.  And Zen shows you step by step how to change things for your own family, and the world.</p>
<p>If you have a loved one that is sick, your family is struggling health issues, and you do not trust our current system to provide you the information you need, know that there is hope, you are not alone, and there are steps you can take to be empowered to create the health and freedom you desire.</p>
<p>The foreword for<i><strong> UNSTOPPABLE</strong></i> was written by Jill C. Carnahan, MD, ABFM, ABHM, a functional medicine expert, conventional farmers daughter and breast cancer and Crohn’s disease survivor.</p>

<p><i>“As a functional medicine doctor, I’ve seen firsthand the increase in chronic conditions in this country. Allergies, autism, autoimmune disease, cancer, obesity and diabetes are undeniably on the rise. So much of what’s causing this phenomenon is the sheer number of chemicals we are exposed to on a daily basis. In fact, I see environmental toxicity as the elephant in the room – the number one burden contributing to chronic disease.  Only through leveraging the accessibility of information can we fight against the onslaught of chemicals that are making us sick – and this is exactly what Zen Honeycutt’s book, UNSTOPPABLE, does.""</i>  <strong>~ Dr. Jill</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SOME <i>UNSTOPPABLE  </i>FEEDBACK:</strong></p>
<p>""Inspiring, poignant, educational, courageous...<i><strong>UNSTOPPABLE</strong></i> is a must read for anyone who is invested in the sustainability of the global food supply, as well as the health of future generations. Zen Honeycutt takes us on a journey of sickness and struggle to health and community empowerment. <strong><i>UNSTOPPABLE</i></strong> captures the undaunted reality that small ripples of change can truly change the tide of the health landscape."" <i><strong>~ Tami Canal, Founder of March Against Monsanto</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<strong><i>UNSTOPPABLE</i></strong> is arguably the best book available today on the topic of toxic foods and their effects on human health.  It is written in highly accessible prose, and it unfolds with a story line of Zen's own journey of personal awakening. Entertaining, absorbing, and even gripping at times, it is the kind of book that you can't put down. Despite the ominous message she delivers, she maintains a sense of optimism throughout, and a belief that the American citizenry can solve the problem through grass roots bottom-up strategies in local communities across the country. Zen is fond of quoting Lily Tomlin who said, ""Somebody ought to do something about that. Wait a minute, I am somebody!""  Zen is truly an embodiment of that message. We are all ""somebody,"" and Zen's book will inspire anybody who reads it to find a way that their special talents can contribute to helping to solve this enormous crisis that our country currently faces.  If we don't all pitch in and do our part, the future of this country is in jeopardy.” <i><strong>~ Dr. Stephanie Seneff, MIT</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<i><strong>UNSTOPPABLE </strong></i> is Zen's immensely informative manifesto, movingly sharing her passage from desperate mother to determined activist, boldly calling out some of the worst culprits behind America's growing health crisis, and passionately making a timely and encouraging call to action. For anyone concerned about the health of our families and future generations, it's our manifesto, too.” <strong><i>~ Saifon Plewtong, “The Healing Chef”, owner of True Seasons Organic Kitchen- Voted one of OC's Top Ten Restaurants by Orange Coast Magazine and CBS twice, founder of JesusHarvest.Life, co-founder of The Free Pantry</i></strong></p>

<h3>WHY CROWD FUNDING?  WHY NOW?  WHY YOU?</h3>
<p>MAA was built around the wisdom of the crowd.  When Zen needed help with the myriad of health issues of her sons, and her doctors couldn’t help, she turned to the internet and found the support and information she was looking for.  She found moms who had triumphed over experiences similar to hers.  She found health professionals, both mainstream and alternative, who saw things differently from their colleagues and offered guidance.  She found journalists and politicians, farmers and scientists, people from all walks of life, from around the world, ready to help.  As MAA has grown, it has done so with the support of that international online community.  Publishing the research, experiences, and solutions of our supporters and courageous authors will fulfill our mission to create healthy communities and expand health and freedom around the world.  </p>

A DEADLY PROBLEM YOU CAN’T SEE, AND MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT

 
The problem is that our food has been changed, it has become toxic, and we are getting sick and mentally impaired.   
The problem is that the chemical companies genetically engineered food crops such as soy, sugar, corn, cottonseed oil and canola to resist toxic pesticides so that they could sell more chemicals.
The problem is that these chemical companies, their sister companies which make pharmaceuticals, and big food and oil companies are controlling our media, government and policy makers.

Our food, tap water, breast milk, cotton sanitary products, beer, wine, and even vaccines are proving to be contaminated with chemicals linked to various diseases, cancer, infertility and mental illnesses which are skyrocketing in America and around the world.
1 out of 2 males and 1 out of 3 females are expected to get cancer in America today, 1 out of 5 have a mental illness, 1 out of 10 has liver disease...and we allow a carcinogen/neurotoxin/liver disease causing chemicals to be sprayed on our food??!!!
 
 CHAPTER 2
A MAJOR PART OF THE SOLUTION – PUTTING MOMS VOICES ON THE  MAAP

 In the process of publishing my own book, UNSTOPPABLE  -- Transforming Sickness and Struggle into Triumph, Empowerment and a Celebration of Community, I realized how difficult it can be. I learned that most publishing houses try to control the language, play it ""safe,"" and keep valuable information from the public to protect themselves. This was upsetting. I could not tolerate having my book censored and not be able to be authentic and honest. I was also shocked by the low royalties authors received from a publishing house and how high the upfront costs are to self-publish a book, the line editing, copy editing, design and book cover...it can easily cost over $6000 for a book with no photos.
Then, with Facebook changing their algorithms and fewer and fewer people opening their emails, even people with 500 - 1000 friends on social media are likely to only sell perhaps 100 books...so re-cooping my investment was a major concern. I was sure other authors were experiencing the same frustrations. Perhaps many don't even start writing a book, even though they have valuable information and experiences to share, because the publishing process can seem so daunting.
Then I met a great editor who previously ran a publishing house, very successfully, and is committed to working only with authentic, honest people who have information that will make a difference in the world. We worked so well together that we decided our moms and supporters should also be able to have this kind of support.
So, I am announcing that we are launching Moms Across America Publishing, a division of our nonprofit, so we can support moms and truth-tellers to get honest information to the world with a knowledgeable team. As a nonprofit that values our supporters, we are committed to giving our authors a much larger percentage of royalties as well -- 2 - 3 times more! With our own platform, which currently reaches 1.5 million a month, and our partnerships, we can bring important information to the public without the censoring, challenges and corporate profit-driven business model of the publishing industry.
If you support the work of Moms Across America or if you have never heard of us before, we invite you to support the launch of our publishing house and the launch of our first book: UNSTOPPABLE -- Transforming Sickness and Struggle into Triumph, Empowerment and a Celebration of Community.
If you are tired of seeing information censored, or the spreading of dishonest information, if you love a family member who is sick, if you are fed up with our current food or political system, or if you want to just support new authors share their voice, we welcome your support.
Our country is in a health crisis. Our families, towns and cities are struggling. It is time for us to take action to bring knowledge and power to our citizens.  It is time to amplify the voice of the mom and truth-tellers who stand for health and freedom.  It is time for community leaders to become global game changers. We can do this. Together. One mom, one child, one dad, one family at a time. Moms Across America Publishing...From our House to Yours.
 
You have important research, experiences and solutions to share!

Someone whose only objective is to help by providing unbiased information based on experience.  An expert without a hidden agenda.  That’s the definition of a Mom’s Across America Publishing (MAAP) author.  
The American food industry is broken.  It has been bought by companies concerned only with profit and government agencies concerned only with following their agendas and keeping their secrets.  It is up to us – you and me – to share our experiences with each other as we learn what is necessary to keep our families safe.  

Over the last five years Moms Across America has created an online community reaching hundreds of millions worldwide.  These are people who come together on social media, in chatrooms and in person to share information and experiences with the goal of keeping all our loved ones safe and ultimately transforming the food supply.  Now we are seeking to take our online activism to a new level by publishing books. Books that will take us beyond a 280-character tweet and allow us to hear each other’s stories, learn from each other’s struggles and successes, and make deeper inroads into reaching the masses still unaware of what is actually on their dinner plate.  We want to amplify the voice of the mom and truth tellers who have experiences that will make a difference to improve our world.

CHAPTER 4
OUR FIRST BOOK….
Our first book, UNSTOPPABLE Transforming Sickness and Struggle into Triumph, Empowerment and a Celebration of Community kicks off our publishing house with a bang.
“When you know better you do better.  Information can save lives.”  So says Zen Honeycutt, founder of Moms Across America, the non-profit whose motto is “Empowered Moms, Healthy Kids.”  Thousands of Moms Across America members, who together reach millions of people worldwide, agree.  
UNSTOPPABLE is the story of a mother who learns about the current state of our world food supply and how it affects your dinner table and the health of everyone you love.  In it Zen walks you through her realization of the chemicals we all feed our loved ones, their origin and effects according to top-notch scientists from around the world, and why none of this is necessary according to farmers who not only want to feed the world but nourish it and protect the environment at the same time.  Moms come forward to talk about the chronic and life-threatening health issues of their children, themselves and other family members that were greatly improved once they took matters into their own hands and acted on the truth.  Scientists back up the moms with independent studies and unbiased peer-reviewed papers. Respected journalists, experts, and other activists share their stories of corporate greed and government corruption, all at the expense of our health.  And Zen shows you step by step how to change things for your own family, and the world.
If you have a loved one that is sick, your family is struggling health issues, and you do not trust our current system to provide you the information you need, know that there is hope, you are not alone, and there are steps you can take to be empowered to create the health and freedom you desire.
The foreword for UNSTOPPABLE was written by Jill C. Carnahan, MD, ABFM, ABHM, a functional medicine expert, conventional farmers daughter and breast cancer and Crohn’s disease survivor.

“As a functional medicine doctor, I’ve seen firsthand the increase in chronic conditions in this country. Allergies, autism, autoimmune disease, cancer, obesity and diabetes are undeniably on the rise. So much of what’s causing this phenomenon is the sheer number of chemicals we are exposed to on a daily basis. In fact, I see environmental toxicity as the elephant in the room – the number one burden contributing to chronic disease.  Only through leveraging the accessibility of information can we fight against the onslaught of chemicals that are making us sick – and this is exactly what Zen Honeycutt’s book, UNSTOPPABLE, does.""  ~ Dr. Jill

<p><i><strong>VOICES</strong></i> is a quarterly literary magazine, featuring the very best in speculative fiction from around the world. Its mission is to promote the work of writers from traditionally marginalised backgrounds.</p>
<p>This includes, but is not limited to, female writers, writers of colour, disabled writers, LGBTQ+ writers, writers from minority religious groups, and foreign writers having their work translated into English.</p>
<p>There is a huge, untapped vein of writing talent out there, and we want to get it, and share it with the world. Our definition of speculative fiction is broad and all-encompassing. Just as we will be showcasing a diverse group of writers, so we want a magazine where genre distinctions are broken down and cast aside.</p>
<p>Each issue will contain over 80,000 words of new fiction. It is a celebration of diversity in the field, and an opportunity for fans of all aspects of speculative fiction to read some of  the most exciting new fiction in the field.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise £12000 from this campaign.</p>
<p>Half of that is to cover the cost of our writers, our cover artist and our editors, all of whom we will pay at professional rates.</p>
<p>The other half covers the cost of producing the first issue - printing and delivery.</p>
<p>We want to avoid using a Print on Demand service, so that we can keep control of the quality and the distribution ourselves.</p>
<p>However, we are realists: should we not reach our target, our first responsibility will be to pay the writers and the artists for their work. Once that is done, we can find another avenue for printing and delivery - selling advertising space in the magazine, for instance, once we're able to confirm the final line-up.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Try this trick at home, if you like: ask a friend who reads a bit, but isn't a deeply-ingrained member of SpecFic fandom, to name a science fiction writer, a fantasy writer and a horror writer. Tell them not to think too long about it.</p>
<p>We don't know you, or your friend, but we're prepared to bet that he named a straight, cisgender, white guy. We're guessing some combination of Asimov, Bradbury, Tolkien, Pratchett, King and Koontz popped up in the list.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with any of those writers, and there's nothing wrong with straight, cisgender, white guys in general. But, these kinds of results <i><strong>are</strong></i> telling. Speculative fiction is all about seeing different worlds through different eyes, and yet the cornerstones of the industry, the ones that leap instantly to the tongue, are all looking out the same kinds of eyes.</p>
<p><i><strong>VOICES</strong></i> looks to challenge that. We want to read a Muslim take on high fantasy, or a Hispanic take on space opera. We want to read a transgender take on cyberpunk, or a gay take on the ghost story. We want to read a Hindu version of the superhero story, or a Japanese take on the werewolf myth, translated from the original Japanese.</p>
<p>There are so many voices on the fringes of speculative fiction. So many stories begging to be told. So many stories that need to be told. We want to give them a home.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Producing the magazine is the least difficult part of the process.

<p>Make some noise!</p>
</div><p> </p></div>","VOICES is a quarterly literary magazine, featuring the very best in speculative fiction from around the world. Its mission is to promote the work of writers from traditionally marginalised backgrounds.
This includes, but is not limited to, female writers, writers of colour, disabled writers, LGBTQ+ writers, writers from minority religious groups, and foreign writers having their work translated into English.
There is a huge, untapped vein of writing talent out there, and we want to get it, and share it with the world. Our definition of speculative fiction is broad and all-encompassing. Just as we will be showcasing a diverse group of writers, so we want a magazine where genre distinctions are broken down and cast aside.
Each issue will contain over 80,000 words of new fiction. It is a celebration of diversity in the field, and an opportunity for fans of all aspects of speculative fiction to read some of  the most exciting new fiction in the field.

What We Need & What You Get
We are looking to raise £12000 from this campaign.
Half of that is to cover the cost of our writers, our cover artist and our editors, all of whom we will pay at professional rates.
The other half covers the cost of producing the first issue - printing and delivery.
We want to avoid using a Print on Demand service, so that we can keep control of the quality and the distribution ourselves.
However, we are realists: should we not reach our target, our first responsibility will be to pay the writers and the artists for their work. Once that is done, we can find another avenue for printing and delivery - selling advertising space in the magazine, for instance, once we're able to confirm the final line-up.

The Impact
Try this trick at home, if you like: ask a friend who reads a bit, but isn't a deeply-ingrained member of SpecFic fandom, to name a science fiction writer, a fantasy writer and a horror writer. Tell them not to think too long about it.
We don't know you, or your friend, but we're prepared to bet that he named a straight, cisgender, white guy. We're guessing some combination of Asimov, Bradbury, Tolkien, Pratchett, King and Koontz popped up in the list.
There's nothing wrong with any of those writers, and there's nothing wrong with straight, cisgender, white guys in general. But, these kinds of results are telling. Speculative fiction is all about seeing different worlds through different eyes, and yet the cornerstones of the industry, the ones that leap instantly to the tongue, are all looking out the same kinds of eyes.
VOICES looks to challenge that. We want to read a Muslim take on high fantasy, or a Hispanic take on space opera. We want to read a transgender take on cyberpunk, or a gay take on the ghost story. We want to read a Hindu version of the superhero story, or a Japanese take on the werewolf myth, translated from the original Japanese.
There are so many voices on the fringes of speculative fiction. So many stories begging to be told. So many stories that need to be told. We want to give them a home.

Risks & Challenges
Producing the magazine is the least difficult part of the process. I'm an editor with over five years experience in the business, and I have friends in the publishing world who have already offered their time and expertise to this project in its early days.We will be collating and editing the content: the stories we're going to source from all over the world. The composition of the magazine we will give to the experts, which is where some of the production money will be going, to get a magazine that looks and feels professional.
Likewise, the printing and the posting will be done in bulk, by a company that does this for a living. I've already spoken to the guys who run the printing and dispatch firm, and we've discussed exactly what they need from us.
All we need now is the money to fund it, and the readers to make it worthwhile.
That's where you come in...

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I am Savania. I am passionate about social justice, equality, inclusion, and last but most importantly - the environment.  I have always had a passion for writing and creative art. And I have now chosen to use these tools to promote and advance issues I care most about. </p>
<p>This campaign is to raise money to publish the first book in what I hope to be a long-running series about a panda who cares about the issue I (and hopefully you) care about: inclusion, justice, and the environment.  Perry is a unique panda who embraces his uniqueness and difference. He is a loving and caring panda who cares deeply for the environment. But he is also a child and thus fun. </p>
<p>We all have children and nieces and nephews and cousins who are unique in their own way. And if you are reading this, I hope you care for our planet and the legacy you are leaving for those children, for the future generations. </p>
<p>This book project is about channeling that passion for social justice, equality, and the environment and imparting it to children. This is deeply important to me, as well as the education of children. If you share with me any one of those passion, your contributions, no matter the size,  to make this project a reality will be a meaningful piece you'll be adding to your legacy, a way for you to contribute not only to art but to something that means more and goes beyond art and beyond you and me. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are not looking for money to change the world. We just need enough to enable us to dedicate our time and effort to finish, market, and release the book in the coming 3-5 months, depends on what happens with the ongoing pandemic.  Creating and publishing a book for global distribution is not easy, so here is the breakdown of the things we'd want to do and cost</p>
<ul>
<li>My illustrator is the talented Shiela Alejandro from the Philippines. Life has not been easy in the Philippines. Shiela need about 2 months to work on and finish all the illustrations (including marketing/promotional material) - <strong>£5 000</strong>
</li>
<li>I need to dedicate a month to finalise the book and get it to an experienced editor - <strong>£5 000</strong>
</li>
<li>We need to run a significant advertising campaign - <strong>£20 000 - £30 000</strong>
</li>
<li>Printing and distribution (initial batch) - <strong>£10 000</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And this what you get, depending on what you are able to contribute and the perk you choose. </p>
<ul>
<li>Have your name listed as one of the co-authors of the book (and/or other productions - television etc that may be based on the book). </li>
<li>A special edition of the book including dedicated acknowledgment of your contribution and a page dedicating the book to children (or grownups) of your choice. </li>
<li>Opportunity to be named as co-creator of the entire book series </li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you can contribute, you will be rewarded and thanked indefinitely. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact of your contribution</h3>
<p>Without your contribution,  millions of children the world over will be denied the opportunity to enjoy the story and know and learn from this this beloved character.  Please don't let that happen. Invite all your friends and neighbours to contribute and join the movement. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we are unable to reach our goal. we will still find a way to publish the book even though that will risk having limited distribution and success. But we will still be able to deliver all the promised perks regardless of whether we reach our target or not. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are looking for all the help you can provide. We are happy to receive any help including but not limited to the following:</p>

Personal Approach:</strong>  I begin with a strong conceptual foundation and personal approach which the reader can use to create a more sustainable lifestyle.  Following this introduction, we focus on the personal level in two chapters on spirituality (Chapter 2), and the goals and aspirations that drive all of us (Chapter 3).  These are subjects that are not even mentioned in much sustainability literature, perhaps because they can be so deeply personal.  That is precisely why these topics are addressed here.  They are profoundly important to reaching sustainability goals since there are long held assumptions and practices that need to be updated.  Sustainability concepts and practices are ideally suited for this.  Chapter 3 presents a new American (and Global) Dream that is informed by the sustainability perspective.  The outdated American Dream focused on material wants and needs.  The sustainable American Dream is abundant spiritually and socially as well as materially.   </p><p><strong>Section 2.  Daily Basics:</strong>  We begin here with the power of the individual as a consumer in Chapter 4.  Wise and informed consumer decisions fully leverage that power, and this can create the demand for more and better sustainable products.  With clean renewable energy sources and recycling, we can evolve from a focus on less consumption to offsetting the more wasteful and polluting alternatives.  There are two keys for our survival and material well-being:  food (Chapter 5) and water (Chapter 6).  For food, much has already been written about nutrition and growing healthy food.  Thus this book focuses also on how you can best access healthy food that also supports the local economy and natural resources.  This includes regional farm to fork efforts and various ways to buy locally, as well as growing at least some of your own food.  Water is an increasingly precious resource, especially in arid regions.  Thus individual needs and consumption patterns are reviewed to point the way toward improvements.</p><p><strong>Section 3. Modern Life:</strong>  We then move on to key technological developments for two of the most significant expenses in our lives:  housing and transportation.  Both can increasingly be powered affordably and reliably by renewable energy sources including solar and wind.  I have found that many consumers need to understand the energy units and terminology for these energy sources and uses, especially kWh.  Thus Chapter 7 is a primer for consumer electricity use and needs.  Then energy uses for both homes (Chapter 8) and mobility (Chapter 9) are discussed, with an emphasis on recent improvements including solar and plug-in electric vehicles. </p><p>The final chapter concludes with a summary and integration of the above.  You can use this to set lifestyle priorities and connect with the larger community and bioregion.</p><p> </p><p><strong>About The Author</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591138824/fx2wxjawye4ss4j7zwsf.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Over 40 years of</i> sustainability experience with consumers, students, projects and programs contribute to this book.  With this diverse background I combine a deep real world understanding of the consumer and the need to communicate clearly with academic rigor based on solid facts and a scientific process.  My <strong>sustainability projects</strong> began in the 1970s.  The first formally recognized as such following the 1987 Brundtland Commission was with the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University starting in the late 1980s.  This grew into projects and programs with international organizations including United Nations (UNESCO, UNEP, UNDP) and World Bank, and the United States including State Department, AID, USDA and NSF.  I also worked in the <strong>private sector</strong> since the late 1990s, mainly in the areas of automotive sales, business development and training.  Since 2010 I have focused on providing the best possible resources (including vehicles, incentives, trained staff) for electric vehicle customers.  This lead to the <a href=""https://calepa.ca.gov/awards/geela/2016yr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2016 California Governor’s Environmental and Economic Leadership Award (GEELA)</a> for promoting the sale and adoption of zero emission vehicles.  I have published about 50 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters.  I have taught classes (undergraduate and graduate) for up to 400 students, and workplace training has been for groups of up to 30-40.  Invited public presentations have ranged from local to national and international.  My educational background includes BS at College of William and Mary, MS at University of Michigan and PhD at University of California.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p><i>Four thousand dollars</i> are needed for the two main tasks that will take the manuscript from over half to fully completed.  The first is to make figures and text files compatible with the Kindle eBook platform for both the eBook and paperback versions.  I have identified professionals which can be hired with this half of the funds.  The second is to complete writing and editing for the manuscript.  Half the funds raised will support an assistant and me for the time needed for this task.  Together, all the above will produce the quality product this project deserves.  The perks are designed to allow you to support this project as you prefer at three major levels  First, you can provide feedback as the manuscript is completed with the $49 Preview Package.  Second, you can simply contribute for the eBook($12) or paperback($20 B&amp;W or $35 Color).  Finally, you can contribute at least $300-$1000 for an interactive presentation customized for your group (final costs depend on number of people, length of interactive presentation, and location).  </p><p> </p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p><i>The biggest challenge</i> with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer.  This includes mailing the book to you.

I will be working closely with Amazon to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the eBook and/or printed versions to you.

Modern Life:  We then move on to key technological developments for two of the most significant expenses in our lives:  housing and transportation.  Both can increasingly be powered affordably and reliably by renewable energy sources including solar and wind.  I have found that many consumers need to understand the energy units and terminology for these energy sources and uses, especially kWh.  Thus Chapter 7 is a primer for consumer electricity use and needs.  Then energy uses for both homes (Chapter 8) and mobility (Chapter 9) are discussed, with an emphasis on recent improvements including solar and plug-in electric vehicles. The final chapter concludes with a summary and integration of the above.  You can use this to set lifestyle priorities and connect with the larger community and bioregion. About The AuthorOver 40 years of sustainability experience with consumers, students, projects and programs contribute to this book.  With this diverse background I combine a deep real world understanding of the consumer and the need to communicate clearly with academic rigor based on solid facts and a scientific process.  My sustainability projects began in the 1970s.  The first formally recognized as such following the 1987 Brundtland Commission was with the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University starting in the late 1980s.  This grew into projects and programs with international organizations including United Nations (UNESCO, UNEP, UNDP) and World Bank, and the United States including State Department, AID, USDA and NSF.  I also worked in the private sector since the late 1990s, mainly in the areas of automotive sales, business development and training.  Since 2010 I have focused on providing the best possible resources (including vehicles, incentives, trained staff) for electric vehicle customers.  This lead to the 2016 California Governor’s Environmental and Economic Leadership Award (GEELA) for promoting the sale and adoption of zero emission vehicles.  I have published about 50 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters.  I have taught classes (undergraduate and graduate) for up to 400 students, and workplace training has been for groups of up to 30-40.  Invited public presentations have ranged from local to national and international.  My educational background includes BS at College of William and Mary, MS at University of Michigan and PhD at University of California. What We Need & What You GetFour thousand dollars are needed for the two main tasks that will take the manuscript from over half to fully completed.  The first is to make figures and text files compatible with the Kindle eBook platform for both the eBook and paperback versions.  I have identified professionals which can be hired with this half of the funds.  The second is to complete writing and editing for the manuscript.  Half the funds raised will support an assistant and me for the time needed for this task.  Together, all the above will produce the quality product this project deserves.  The perks are designed to allow you to support this project as you prefer at three major levels  First, you can provide feedback as the manuscript is completed with the $49 Preview Package.  Second, you can simply contribute for the eBook($12) or paperback($20 B&W or $35 Color).  Finally, you can contribute at least $300-$1000 for an interactive presentation customized for your group (final costs depend on number of people, length of interactive presentation, and location).   Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer.  This includes mailing the book to you. I have reduced this risk by building into the campaign the estimated shipping costs of copies to you within each order tier.The risk of delivering the copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with Amazon to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the eBook and/or printed versions to you. We will keep all backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. Thus you will know when the copies you ordered are expected to ship. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute, that doesn't mean that you can't help:Please share my campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please tag me so we can help amplify your efforts.You can easily share my campaign page via Indiegogo at the top of the page.Please share this book campaign with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it.

<h3>Welcome to the <i>Farima</i> Indiegogo campaign!</h3>
<p>As some of you may know, my name is Brian Lewis and I am the author of the upcoming novel <i>Farima. </i>Before I talk about my book, allow me to share some information about myself. I'm 32 years old and I live in North Carolina. I was raised in a close and very tight-knit family and since I was young, I was always a dreamer. I played video games, read books, even spent some time as an actor because I've always enjoyed worldbuilding. We enjoy science fiction and fantasy because of the momentary escape it provides. So I would imagine I was in the worlds built by other creators</p>
<p><i>Farima</i> represents my opportunity to give to other readers what so many other creators have given to me. A beautiful world to escape to and get lost in.<i> Farima</i> is an afro-futurist science fiction novel set in the year 2082 in the fictional nation of New Manden. It takes place in the real world, though this is a much different future than the world that we live in today. <i>Farima</i> suggests that the future doesn't have to be bleak and dystopian. It suggests that the future can be abundant, free and progressive with the basic necessities for survival provided as a right.</p>

<h3>Institute for Christian Socialism (ICS)  </h3>
<p>The Institute for Christian Socialism activates and equips US Christians and churches for the work of education, resistance, and constructive transformation. Our mission is to support US churches, their members, and institutions in confronting the world’s captivity to capitalism and in claiming, embodying, and promoting the radical socialism of the Christian faith and life. In time, we will be seeking financial support for each of the interrelated initiatives of ICS, including Radical Convivia, the Solidarities Project, a Fellows program, and more. For now, we are prioritizing <i>The Bias Magazine</i>.     </p>
<h3>Help us launch <i>The Bias Magazine</i>
</h3>
<p><i>The Bias</i> is the inaugural project of the Institute for Christian Socialism and the premier voice of the Left in American Christianity. Cutting across the routine conventions of the Church and religious academy, we are the distinctive radical and ecumenical voice on politics, culture, economy, and environment. Your funding supports the production and labor costs for print and digital editions of <i>The Bias</i>. The print edition publishes twice a year, with digital content appearing regularly every week. </p>
<p>We need to fundraise $35,000 to sustain and build the work we've begun. Can you and your household consider a gift to help us grow in the new year?</p>
<h3>Why <i>The Bias</i>? Why Now?</h3>
<p><i>The Bias </i>is designed to respond to the absence in the religious publishing landscape of a distinctive leftwing and socialist voice. <i>The Bias </i>will give voice to the conviction that the Christian Church and its theology cannot be accurately understood in our time apart from its material conditions. The absence of any significant representation of the political Left within the Church, academy, or religious and theological media only exacerbates these conditions. <i>The Bias</i> will speak to the intersection of church life and Left politics, better represent the church within the politics of the Left, and help nurture new social formations, within the church and society at large</p>
<p>Readers of <i>First Things</i>, <i>Sojourners</i>, and <i>Christianity Today </i>will find a unique voice and perspective presented in our pages, and will stand as a Christian iteration of publications like <i>Jacobin</i>, <i>Catalyst</i>, <i>Dissent</i>, and <i>New Left Review</i>, while remaining distinct enough in its format from these other programs to offer consistent brand and market differentiation.</p>
<h3>What can I expect to find in <i>The Bias</i>?</h3>
<p><i>The Bias</i> will begin as a digital publication. We have begun planning to grow into a print magazine while continuing to generate quality digital content. <i>The Bias </i>will explore issues of politics, culture, economy, and environment from an ecumenical and radical perspective. Each published issue will present a guiding theme. For example, one issue may focus on “Race,” “The Left and Religion,” “Climate Change,” or “Labor.” While each of these themes is responsive to contemporary news cycles, the editorial voice and presentation will approach them in an “evergreen” fashion, so that every issue will be fresh and relevant for many months after initial release. This same relevance will also be sustained by the regular content posted to the magazine’s website every week.</p>
<p>The magazine format will allow for the publication of a number of notable voices from across the fields of contemporary theology, ethics, textual study, and religious history. Every piece published will emphasize fine writing and original, unconventional analysis of the intersection of Christianity with contemporary social, political, and cultural life. The reader can expect certain types of regular commentary, but both the print and online formats will allow for a great deal of flexibility in terms of themes, topics, and outlook. Cultural commentary, film and music criticism, and human-interest pieces will also be regular features of magazine.</p>
<p>The production cycle for our print magazine will be seasonal, with new writing appearing each week online. Essays and commentary will be curated and solicited by editors overseeing topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Politics</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Environment</li>
<li>Anti-racist and feminist movements and theory</li>
<li>The Religious Right</li>
<li>Political theology</li>
<li>History of Christian socialism</li>
<li>Film, art, and literature</li>
</ul>
<h3>What does my donation help with?</h3>
<p>In order to make <i>The Bias</i> a reality, we need your support to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase technology and website tools to support the digital presence of <i>The Bias</i>
</li>
<li>Compensate writers and editors for their work</li>
<li>Expand our artistic capacities by compensating radical artists</li>
</ul>
<p>For this funding cycle, we need to fundraise<strong> $35,000</strong> to sustain our initial launch. Costs of production for<i>The Bias</i> are currently budgeted at <strong>$150,000</strong> per year. If you would like to make a large gift and/or would like to explore partnership as a publisher, seminary, denominational organization, or religiously-focused philanthropy, we welcome the opportunity.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution now makes a difference. You are helping us to establish a firm foundation for<i>The Bias </i>and to develop additional material manifestations of the vision of God’s new creation: a society marked by the interdependent health of our common earthly home, the shared enjoyment of our common wealth, and the just participation of all in our common social and political life together.   </p>
<p><i>The Bias</i> is just the start. Our Solidarity Projects and Convivia are emerging even now. The vision has its time. It will not delay.   </p>

<p><strong>Thank you for the support over the 3 years, this marks as our 3rd and final successful fundraiser! We appreciate the belief, effort and standing by us - through the growth. This marls as our final fundraiser in 3 years!</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>What is IDEA, WHAT DOES IT DO AND HOW FAR CAN IDEA GO INTO CHANGING THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND THE LGBT COMMUNITY?</strong></u></p>
<p>IDEA was founded to raise awareness within African Communities on the need to support the rights of young feminists and the LGBTQ community especially trans, bi women and lesbians. We started with Kenya, we are now in East, West and Southern Africa! We decided at the end of 2018 to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have writers and activists all over Africa hence we opened up calls for submissions to be continental!</li>
<li>Have department heads on a regional level and on certain much-needed topics and we have gotten heads for 3 regions (East, West, Southern) and different column editors for similar topics in different regions!</li>
<li>To have a sustainable model that would create employment, help us build the physical Hub we have been aiming for and support other African led initiatives. (our financial projection aims at catering for the needs mentioned)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>OUR PLAN?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Monthly subscriptions (we tested the concept with Kenyan Feminists and it proved to be a success but we decided to have more content and more platforms before implementing the model)</li>
<li>Partnerships with women and LGBT led businesses  (we already have a few ready to jump on board)</li>
</ol>
<p>Each year we have been asking for two hundred dollars ($200) but this year to actually hope to have a hand up rather than the annual handout, hence we are looking to raise $3000. </p>
<p>We are asking for help raising $3000 for the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Paying for annual hosting. We are growing and we need to have better hosting options to accommodate our content. Our hosting, domain and custom themes since 2015 used to cost us around $100 but with growing content inclusive of videos and an online community we need to purchase the following:<p>- Annual Hosting costs - $220 with a 63% off discount annually. Without the discount, the cost would be $563 (the package is 36 months all paid hosting at Bluehost and estimates roughly the same with most hosting companies)</p>
<p>- Custom Themes $168</p>
<p>- Graphics and stock images - these will cost us about $1.67 a piece (stock images) and we need about 48 annually hence a total of $80.16 annually. We have a graphic designer's proposal to charge us $300 annually to make us 180 posters in 2019.</p>
<p>- Website maintenance: $100 (we have a web designer that has cut off over 90% of the fee charged to maintain the site year round.)</p>
</li>
<li>Buying a camera and sound (for our interviews with women and members of the LGBTQ community) on social, economic and political matters that influence diversity, equality, and Inclusion. Our aim here is to be a driving force for change by giving women and the LGBTQ community the voice needed to start a revolution. $580 for a camera and $100 for sound. When we started out, we would borrow cameras to attend and support events and when we couldn't anymore the program died out. We need to start a fierce web series that creates a platform to have discussions such a more inclusive and informed version of<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XzReJ1o-_Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> this one</a>.</li>
<li>We need a piece of podcast equipment for daily podcast shows centred around campaigning for Equality, Inclusion, and Diversity. The podcast studio we have spotted will cost us $530 and the package entails: <p>- A professional podcasting, music production, and digital home recording equipment</p>
<p>- Full recording  ""out of the box"" studio including FireWire interface, mixer, microphone, headphones, professional music software and more</p>
<p>- Professional 8-input 2-bus mixer with premium mic preamps and 3-band EQs</p>
<p>- Table microphone stand, microphone windscreen and cable, four 1/4"" jack cables and two FireWire cables</p>
<p>- Powerful DAW software </p>
</li>
<li>Buy a laptop that will be used for video editing, editing content sent to us and also use it for operations. $500</li>
<li>We will finally start our monthly comic series. We are being charged $50 a month for 2 comics, 4 issues, and satire based posters on reverse gender roles. One of our founders will pay for $200. we need $400. Total $600-200.</li>
</ol>
<p>We need a total of $3206 but our founder will cover $206 on top of what we need help with raising.</p>

<ol></ol>
<p><strong>IDEA OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p>IDEA has been using the creative and online space to advocate for diversity, inclusion and Equality for young women and members of the LGBTQ community. Kenya, like most African nations, tends to culturally and socially exclude women and members of the LGBTQ community in the participation of community policies and activities. </p>
<p>IDEA AFRICA emphasizes on the need for African activism on three fronts: issues activism takes on with a focus on women and the LGBTQ community, the African communities approaching those issues and the ways they choose to tackle them factoring in the deeply embedded oppressive cultural norms that instigate injustices and oppression.</p>
<p>Women are seen as an inferior gender and their voices silenced whereas, members of the LGBTQ community especially trans (with examples of people coming out and being shunned evident)- they are seen to defy and insult the African culture. Sexual rights and identities are a mere concept in most nations in Africa. Women have a huge gap to fill. Our goal as IDEA is to make sure that there is a voice, and a stern loud one when it comes to respecting and enforcing the rights of women and the LGBTQ community through online advocacy and partnerships. </p>
<p>This can only be done by normalizing what is seen as a divorce of the culture and pinpointing the shareholders of change.  A lot of oppression on women and members of the LGBTQ community is instigated by norms that are derived from moral high grounds crafted either by culture or politics for the benefit of the majority beneficiaries. </p>
<p>To push for more resource centres, policies, initiatives we need to have a bigger voice. We need to have more people join us. To create impact we need allies, we need support. To be different, impactful and ready to be change makers we need you!</p>
<p>Kenyans, have a huge online presence and a love for the creative space, hence provides us with the platform to create awareness and acceptance. We would love to have more women, men included in decision-making processes politically which often links back to the social and economic growth of women, especially young women without the stigmatization that comes with stereotyping, successful confident young women. We would also love to have the nation and continent at large create a positive atmosphere for young members of the LGBTQ community to outright participate in and voice for their needs and rights. </p>
<p>The magazine has already had various writers and collaborators come forth to talk about issues at hand when it comes to diversity and inclusion of women and members of the LGBTQ community. <br/>We have been mentors and guest speakers in Universities such as Mount Kenya University and Moi University in Kenya, we have been panellists in women forums such as women in tech, had partnerships with YouTube shows such as Zero Chills TV to freely talk about the LGBTQ community, are having ongoing recruitment from the creative space on our various projects such as JiEducate (focus on constitution and possible implementations for inclusiveness), Maverick woman (helps young women and girls follow the lead of local heroes) and JiCode Program that uses training to give women an option to having a voice.</p>
<p>We have actively involved organizations on the 16 days of activism against SGBV toolkit. We already received a draft of the proposed sexual harassment policy and we are hoping to also urge orgs in Kenya and Africa to adopt them. We just started our campaigns to ask organizations to at least have activities that advocate for the CM policy implementation and are providing them with activity guides.</p>
<p>IDEA AFRICA has been running <a href=""http://afroidea.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">as a magazine</a> (3rd year now). Since we are focusing on online activism before we start holding matches and forums; we want to grow from being just a magazine to having a podcast station that will eventually be a radio station, and also have web series on YouTube and Facebook videos to reach out to more Africans. We have proved in 3 years that online activism is the future and it instigates physical protests, signatures, activities, and partnerships.</p>
<p>Help us pay for our annual hosting and domain, our magazine theme and the necessary plugins for our online magazine. Help us start a docuseries (create weekly videos interviewing women and members of the LGBTQ community) centred around giving women and members of the LGBTQ community a voice. Help us create and launch our podcast show centred on reaching out to survivors, activists, and maverick women in African communities. </p>
<h3><strong><u>HOW YOUR SUPPORT REACHES MILLIONS</u></strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>IDEA has been running since 2015. In the last 3 years, we have not achieved the maximum potential that we set out to. Our mandate was to reach out to millions all over Africa by 2018, becoming a major force of change. Regardless: In the last 3 years, we have succeeded with your annual help of around $200 involved over 5 countries by getting content and readers from the nations. These nations entail South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Burundi and recently - Ghana and Nigeria. We have also had women from Europe submit their publications on Africa and the practices published. We are hoping to finally get to all African nations.</li>
<li>We have run campaigns in the past and we have always raised about $180-220. Our last campaign which just ended on 22/12/2018 and we raised $5. Lack of resources is a huge hindrance in being change makers. But it has not stopped us. Having your support means creating unimaginable possibilities for change. </li>
</ol>
<p>IDEA AFRICA run by young activists (20-27) takes a different approach to activism, in general, let alone feminism because AFRICA is deep-rooted in so much patriarchal culture, we are basically brought up in it and African feminism needs a different approach to smash these oppressive norms. In our platform; we have activists, feminists, allies to feminism and we also have readers (who generally visit the site for research purposes on what the movement is about).</p>
<p>To date, we have diverse writers. Both women, women, and men in the LGBTQIA community and men. We have doctors, psychologists, lawyers, social workers and activists that voluntarily send content to us.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>IDEA'S MILESTONES</u></h3>
<ul>
<li>We have had women and members of the LGBTQIA community come to us for info on where to get help and given that we have experts writing for us (volunteers), we send them to the right people. We are hoping this becomes a norm and we can form partnerships with organizations and experts where we link our audience with the necessary professionals directly through our platforms especially on matters of mental health, medical help and legal procedures in the case of GBV.</li>
<li>We now have writers from over 6 African countries. We hope it to be more than 20 by end of the year or much more!</li>
<li>We have up to 25k reads in certain articles and that's a sign we are reaching people and hopefully sparking discussions. </li>
<li>We have been nominated for the following:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Pivot East Africa (an incubator for hubs in Africa making a change using tech) - we were semi-finalists</li>
<li>We have successfully reached the final stage of FRIDA, but unfortunately did not secure the top 5 voted position to receive funding</li>
<li>We have been nominated for BAKE (Bloggers Association of Kenya) under the girl's and women empowerment category, we, unfortunately, did not win the award category.</li>
<li>We are partners with several universities and organizations in Kenya. We have been invited to women in Tech forum as speakers and Mount Kenya University as well</li>
</ol>
<p>We have also been able to form partnerships with 2 to 3 organizations that assist women and members of the LGBTQIA community.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>WHY THE SLOW GROWTH?</strong></u></p>
<p>We are founders and a team of under 26-year-olds. Initially, the magazine was run by one person, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/stella.busolo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ella</a>; for almost 2 years and everything would be out of pocket in addition to the around $400 we have raised in 3 years. </p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://afroidea.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE IS THE LINK FOR THE MAGAZINE</a></strong></p>
</div><div>
<ul></ul>
<p>We are growing, we are making a difference. We need to keep it going, keep it steady. We need you for the change to actualize.</p>
<ol></ol>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Risks &amp; Challenges IDEA faces</u></h3>
<p>The following have slowed us down rapidly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The age factor: IDEA's founders are all 26 and below hence a lot of our ideologies are pushed off, as we are growing at a significantly low pace due to lack of resources</li>
<li>Despite this challenge, we have never been shunned away from actualizing what we set our hearts to. </li>

</div></div>","Thank you for the support over the 3 years, this marks as our 3rd and final successful fundraiser! We appreciate the belief, effort and standing by us - through the growth. This marls as our final fundraiser in 3 years!
What is IDEA, WHAT DOES IT DO AND HOW FAR CAN IDEA GO INTO CHANGING THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND THE LGBT COMMUNITY?
IDEA was founded to raise awareness within African Communities on the need to support the rights of young feminists and the LGBTQ community especially trans, bi women and lesbians. We started with Kenya, we are now in East, West and Southern Africa! We decided at the end of 2018 to:

Have writers and activists all over Africa hence we opened up calls for submissions to be continental!
Have department heads on a regional level and on certain much-needed topics and we have gotten heads for 3 regions (East, West, Southern) and different column editors for similar topics in different regions!
To have a sustainable model that would create employment, help us build the physical Hub we have been aiming for and support other African led initiatives. (our financial projection aims at catering for the needs mentioned)

OUR PLAN?

Monthly subscriptions (we tested the concept with Kenyan Feminists and it proved to be a success but we decided to have more content and more platforms before implementing the model)
Partnerships with women and LGBT led businesses  (we already have a few ready to jump on board)

Each year we have been asking for two hundred dollars ($200) but this year to actually hope to have a hand up rather than the annual handout, hence we are looking to raise $3000. 
We are asking for help raising $3000 for the following:

Paying for annual hosting. We are growing and we need to have better hosting options to accommodate our content. Our hosting, domain and custom themes since 2015 used to cost us around $100 but with growing content inclusive of videos and an online community we need to purchase the following:- Annual Hosting costs - $220 with a 63% off discount annually. Without the discount, the cost would be $563 (the package is 36 months all paid hosting at Bluehost and estimates roughly the same with most hosting companies)
- Custom Themes $168
- Graphics and stock images - these will cost us about $1.67 a piece (stock images) and we need about 48 annually hence a total of $80.16 annually. We have a graphic designer's proposal to charge us $300 annually to make us 180 posters in 2019.
- Website maintenance: $100 (we have a web designer that has cut off over 90% of the fee charged to maintain the site year round.)

Buying a camera and sound (for our interviews with women and members of the LGBTQ community) on social, economic and political matters that influence diversity, equality, and Inclusion. Our aim here is to be a driving force for change by giving women and the LGBTQ community the voice needed to start a revolution. $580 for a camera and $100 for sound. When we started out, we would borrow cameras to attend and support events and when we couldn't anymore the program died out. We need to start a fierce web series that creates a platform to have discussions such a more inclusive and informed version of this one.
We need a piece of podcast equipment for daily podcast shows centred around campaigning for Equality, Inclusion, and Diversity. The podcast studio we have spotted will cost us $530 and the package entails: - A professional podcasting, music production, and digital home recording equipment
- Full recording  ""out of the box"" studio including FireWire interface, mixer, microphone, headphones, professional music software and more
- Professional 8-input 2-bus mixer with premium mic preamps and 3-band EQs
- Table microphone stand, microphone windscreen and cable, four 1/4"" jack cables and two FireWire cables
- Powerful DAW software 

Buy a laptop that will be used for video editing, editing content sent to us and also use it for operations. $500
We will finally start our monthly comic series. We are being charged $50 a month for 2 comics, 4 issues, and satire based posters on reverse gender roles. One of our founders will pay for $200. we need $400. Total $600-200.

We need a total of $3206 but our founder will cover $206 on top of what we need help with raising.


IDEA OVERVIEW
IDEA has been using the creative and online space to advocate for diversity, inclusion and Equality for young women and members of the LGBTQ community. Kenya, like most African nations, tends to culturally and socially exclude women and members of the LGBTQ community in the participation of community policies and activities. 
IDEA AFRICA emphasizes on the need for African activism on three fronts: issues activism takes on with a focus on women and the LGBTQ community, the African communities approaching those issues and the ways they choose to tackle them factoring in the deeply embedded oppressive cultural norms that instigate injustices and oppression.
Women are seen as an inferior gender and their voices silenced whereas, members of the LGBTQ community especially trans (with examples of people coming out and being shunned evident)- they are seen to defy and insult the African culture. Sexual rights and identities are a mere concept in most nations in Africa. Women have a huge gap to fill. Our goal as IDEA is to make sure that there is a voice, and a stern loud one when it comes to respecting and enforcing the rights of women and the LGBTQ community through online advocacy and partnerships. 
This can only be done by normalizing what is seen as a divorce of the culture and pinpointing the shareholders of change.  A lot of oppression on women and members of the LGBTQ community is instigated by norms that are derived from moral high grounds crafted either by culture or politics for the benefit of the majority beneficiaries. 
To push for more resource centres, policies, initiatives we need to have a bigger voice. We need to have more people join us. To create impact we need allies, we need support. To be different, impactful and ready to be change makers we need you!
Kenyans, have a huge online presence and a love for the creative space, hence provides us with the platform to create awareness and acceptance. We would love to have more women, men included in decision-making processes politically which often links back to the social and economic growth of women, especially young women without the stigmatization that comes with stereotyping, successful confident young women. We would also love to have the nation and continent at large create a positive atmosphere for young members of the LGBTQ community to outright participate in and voice for their needs and rights. 
The magazine has already had various writers and collaborators come forth to talk about issues at hand when it comes to diversity and inclusion of women and members of the LGBTQ community. We have been mentors and guest speakers in Universities such as Mount Kenya University and Moi University in Kenya, we have been panellists in women forums such as women in tech, had partnerships with YouTube shows such as Zero Chills TV to freely talk about the LGBTQ community, are having ongoing recruitment from the creative space on our various projects such as JiEducate (focus on constitution and possible implementations for inclusiveness), Maverick woman (helps young women and girls follow the lead of local heroes) and JiCode Program that uses training to give women an option to having a voice.
We have actively involved organizations on the 16 days of activism against SGBV toolkit. We already received a draft of the proposed sexual harassment policy and we are hoping to also urge orgs in Kenya and Africa to adopt them. We just started our campaigns to ask organizations to at least have activities that advocate for the CM policy implementation and are providing them with activity guides.
IDEA AFRICA has been running as a magazine (3rd year now). Since we are focusing on online activism before we start holding matches and forums; we want to grow from being just a magazine to having a podcast station that will eventually be a radio station, and also have web series on YouTube and Facebook videos to reach out to more Africans. We have proved in 3 years that online activism is the future and it instigates physical protests, signatures, activities, and partnerships.
Help us pay for our annual hosting and domain, our magazine theme and the necessary plugins for our online magazine. Help us start a docuseries (create weekly videos interviewing women and members of the LGBTQ community) centred around giving women and members of the LGBTQ community a voice. Help us create and launch our podcast show centred on reaching out to survivors, activists, and maverick women in African communities. 
HOW YOUR SUPPORT REACHES MILLIONS

IDEA has been running since 2015. In the last 3 years, we have not achieved the maximum potential that we set out to. Our mandate was to reach out to millions all over Africa by 2018, becoming a major force of change. Regardless: In the last 3 years, we have succeeded with your annual help of around $200 involved over 5 countries by getting content and readers from the nations. These nations entail South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Burundi and recently - Ghana and Nigeria. We have also had women from Europe submit their publications on Africa and the practices published. We are hoping to finally get to all African nations.
We have run campaigns in the past and we have always raised about $180-220. Our last campaign which just ended on 22/12/2018 and we raised $5. Lack of resources is a huge hindrance in being change makers. But it has not stopped us. Having your support means creating unimaginable possibilities for change. 

IDEA AFRICA run by young activists (20-27) takes a different approach to activism, in general, let alone feminism because AFRICA is deep-rooted in so much patriarchal culture, we are basically brought up in it and African feminism needs a different approach to smash these oppressive norms. In our platform; we have activists, feminists, allies to feminism and we also have readers (who generally visit the site for research purposes on what the movement is about).
To date, we have diverse writers. Both women, women, and men in the LGBTQIA community and men. We have doctors, psychologists, lawyers, social workers and activists that voluntarily send content to us.
IDEA'S MILESTONES

We have had women and members of the LGBTQIA community come to us for info on where to get help and given that we have experts writing for us (volunteers), we send them to the right people. We are hoping this becomes a norm and we can form partnerships with organizations and experts where we link our audience with the necessary professionals directly through our platforms especially on matters of mental health, medical help and legal procedures in the case of GBV.
We now have writers from over 6 African countries. We hope it to be more than 20 by end of the year or much more!
We have up to 25k reads in certain articles and that's a sign we are reaching people and hopefully sparking discussions. 
We have been nominated for the following:


Pivot East Africa (an incubator for hubs in Africa making a change using tech) - we were semi-finalists
We have successfully reached the final stage of FRIDA, but unfortunately did not secure the top 5 voted position to receive funding
We have been nominated for BAKE (Bloggers Association of Kenya) under the girl's and women empowerment category, we, unfortunately, did not win the award category.
We are partners with several universities and organizations in Kenya. We have been invited to women in Tech forum as speakers and Mount Kenya University as well

We have also been able to form partnerships with 2 to 3 organizations that assist women and members of the LGBTQIA community.
WHY THE SLOW GROWTH?
We are founders and a team of under 26-year-olds. Initially, the magazine was run by one person, Ella; for almost 2 years and everything would be out of pocket in addition to the around $400 we have raised in 3 years. 
HERE IS THE LINK FOR THE MAGAZINE


We are growing, we are making a difference. We need to keep it going, keep it steady. We need you for the change to actualize.


The Risks & Challenges IDEA faces
The following have slowed us down rapidly:

The age factor: IDEA's founders are all 26 and below hence a lot of our ideologies are pushed off, as we are growing at a significantly low pace due to lack of resources
Despite this challenge, we have never been shunned away from actualizing what we set our hearts to. 

We are hoping that this campaign is the beginning of enforcing the fierce fire burning within us to make a change. Each pledge from $5 gives you access to our 2019 content sent via email each month. Ps# we will also appreciate cameras, laptops and anything useful for writing, podcast and video creation be it new or old.

<p>Blessings Everyone! My name is Lakshmi, and I am an artist, singer/songwriter, dancer and garden enthusiast.

<p>Realizing I cannot reach every child physically, I wrote and illustrated a children’s book to encapsulate the joy of growing up, and playing outside in the garden.</p>
<p>It’s called “Love Grows Love: Starlight Seeds of Creation,” and it’s all about the journey of a seed.</p>
<p>With your support, the book can get printed, packaged with seeds and out into the hands of children!</p>

<h2>Who I am:</h2>
<p>Passion is defined as ""an intense desire or enthusiasm for something"". Today I am inviting you on my personal journey and my lifelong passion for writing. I am asking kind donors such as yourselves to kindly pledge to my fundraiser. I am fundraising to help me complete my second novel in my series called Ismark. Having already completed the first novel I am excited to continue the saga and to present to all of you bibliophiles the next installment in this adventure series. <br/><br/>My name is JH Lillevik. My passion for the written word started many years ago. I have been blessed to work as a screenwriter and as a writing consultant. My first writing credit was a few years back on a feature film called The House directed by the famed Reinert Kiil. I now regularly work as a screenwriting consultant for the Norwegian film industry.</p>
<h3>The Story:</h3>
<p>The Golden Bond is a continuation of the story Eirick, a young slave from the land of Ismark. The story follows his adventures in strange and foreign lands. I have spent many years developing the world, characters, and many other exciting creatures that Eirick encounters on his coming of age journey. This is a story for our time even though it takes place in a different time and place where dwarves and merfolk roam and live. The message is uplifting and explores a man's journey as he starts at the bottom of a system and struggles to rise to the top. The story also explores the idea of being chosen to something and having a destiny. Everyone has their own destiny and this story closely follows Eiricks journey.<br/><br/>As mentioned, this is the second installment in the series. The first novel was very well received and has garnered great ratings on both Goodreads and Amazon. I encourage to grab yourself a copy of ""The Marked Boy"", sit back, and embark on the journey as well.</p>
<h3>The Needs and the Perks:</h3>
<p>Today I am raising $5000 to pay for an editor, printing 200+ hardcover copies, cover design, and to allow me to take some time off to complete this novel. The funds and time off allow me to focus solely on this project and to give it the best storyline possible that will not disappoint.<br/>$10 donation gets you a digital copy of both The Golden Bond and The Marked Boy<br/><br/>$40 gets you a hardcover copy of either The Golden Bond or The Marked Boy.<br/><br/>$80 will get you hardcover copies of both books in the series.<br/><br/>$100 and you will receive signed copies of both books and an Ismark coffee cup to enjoy while you go on the adventure.</p>
<h3>Risk and Challenges</h3>
<p>As mentioned above I do work as a screenwriter in the industry and at this point cannot dedicate 100% of my time to bringing you the next installment. If I do not receive full funding it will take me longer to complete, I will complete this given the opportunity and time to do so. This is my passion, I truly love writing and presenting to kind people like you entertaining stories that will last ages. Because I have such a great love for writing and this saga I never experience writer's block which is often a hindrance for many amateur and experienced novelists.</p>
<h3>How you can help:</h3>
<p>Pledge today and share my story with everyone you know who is also passionate about books and reading. Tweet and share on Facebook, even private message to your friends and family. Together we can bring this incredible story to life. If you kindly make a donation today please feel free to contact me and I would be more than happy to talk with you and share my ideas. Thank you so much!<br/><br/>Also, visit my blog at jhlillevik.com and spread things I have written there. Everything you do to spread the message is of great help to me. So thank you in advance and I hope you will enjoy taking this journey with me and Eirick.<br/><br/><strong>Sample chapter:</strong><br/><a href=""https://jhlillevik.com/2018/08/21/the-golden-bond-chapter-1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://jhlillevik.com/2018/08/21/the-golden-bo...</a></p>

My first writing credit was a few years back on a feature film called The House directed by the famed Reinert Kiil. I now regularly work as a screenwriting consultant for the Norwegian film industry.
The Story:
The Golden Bond is a continuation of the story Eirick, a young slave from the land of Ismark. The story follows his adventures in strange and foreign lands. I have spent many years developing the world, characters, and many other exciting creatures that Eirick encounters on his coming of age journey. This is a story for our time even though it takes place in a different time and place where dwarves and merfolk roam and live. The message is uplifting and explores a man's journey as he starts at the bottom of a system and struggles to rise to the top. The story also explores the idea of being chosen to something and having a destiny. Everyone has their own destiny and this story closely follows Eiricks journey.As mentioned, this is the second installment in the series. The first novel was very well received and has garnered great ratings on both Goodreads and Amazon. I encourage to grab yourself a copy of ""The Marked Boy"", sit back, and embark on the journey as well.
The Needs and the Perks:
Today I am raising $5000 to pay for an editor, printing 200+ hardcover copies, cover design, and to allow me to take some time off to complete this novel. The funds and time off allow me to focus solely on this project and to give it the best storyline possible that will not disappoint.$10 donation gets you a digital copy of both The Golden Bond and The Marked Boy$40 gets you a hardcover copy of either The Golden Bond or The Marked Boy.$80 will get you hardcover copies of both books in the series.$100 and you will receive signed copies of both books and an Ismark coffee cup to enjoy while you go on the adventure.
Risk and Challenges
As mentioned above I do work as a screenwriter in the industry and at this point cannot dedicate 100% of my time to bringing you the next installment. If I do not receive full funding it will take me longer to complete, I will complete this given the opportunity and time to do so. This is my passion, I truly love writing and presenting to kind people like you entertaining stories that will last ages. Because I have such a great love for writing and this saga I never experience writer's block which is often a hindrance for many amateur and experienced novelists.
How you can help:

Together we can bring this incredible story to life. If you kindly make a donation today please feel free to contact me and I would be more than happy to talk with you and share my ideas. Thank you so much!Also, visit my blog at jhlillevik.com and spread things I have written there. Everything you do to spread the message is of great help to me.

<p><strong>HELLO</strong></p>
<p>My name is John Frederick. I am someone who at one time had a miserable life — many health issues, depression, addiction, financial difficulties, bankruptcy, homelessness and general discouragement. I was fairly hopeless; I didn’t think that that life was ever going to work for me.<br/> </p>
<p>Then starting in 1990, things began to change. Circumstances drove me to desparation and I began to learn spiritual principles that brought me up and out of the pits of despair into a life beyond my wildest dreams. Out of this journey, I have developed a 12-week course that is soon to be a self-published book:</p>
<p><strong>Prosperity Now! A 12-Week Journey to the Life of Your Dreams</strong></p>
<p>Using my own life’s story, from homeless, hopeless and addicted, to an amazing life of purpose and abundance, the Prosperity Now! course will show people how they can transform their life too. Using ancient and modern, practical spiritual principles — ones that anyone can develop and practice — people can move beyond their current circumstances— no matter how dire — and begin to see the possiblities and realize their dreams!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>MY CAMPAIGN </strong></p>
<p>This Indegogo campaign will help me defray the costs of publishing the course as a self-study book. I want to help as many people as possible, but I can only take on a limited number of  individual students and groups. I want to publish the course as a book to get it out into the world.</p>
<p>Especially Now! in 2020, people need help, need answers, need hope. By contributing to Prosperity Now! you will be helping me to shine this light into the darkness, giving people the practical means they need to lift themselves out of poverty, dispair and helplessness.</p>
<p>In the current world crisis, this book is needed more than ever. I hope millions will use it to see past appearances, to the truth of their own greatness, and begin the journey to fulfill their deepest heart’s desires.</p>
<p>You can be a part of this effort to help people transform their lives, and thus help transform the world!<br/> </p>
<p><strong>TESTIMONIAL </strong></p>
<p>John A. Frederick’s new book, Prosperity Now! A 12-Week Journey to the Life of Your Dreams, is a tour-de-force of practical, spiritual, and financial advice on how to achieve the life you’ve always wanted. Drawing upon [many spiritual paths, including] the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Frederick walks readers through a twelve-week course that teaches them not only how to find prosperity, but how to eliminate all the things blocking them from achieving it.<br/>— Tyler Tichlaar, PhD., award-winning author of <i>Narrow Lives</i> and <i>The Best Place</i></p>
<p><br/><strong>CAMPAIGN BUDGET and GOALS</strong></p>
<p>So far, I have spent about $6,300 to ready the course as a self-published book.  I am looking for investors to support my work, and recoup some of my investment so I can use those funds to distribute the book widely, to schools, churches, support groups and others who could benefit from this knowledge.</p>
<p>I DO NOT charge a fee to Prosperity Now! students and groups for my courses. Everything is on the basis of “Tithing” which is the most powerful spiritual concept I use in my own life, to change my thinking and my circumstances. Tithing is the spiritual concept that recognizes that it is the Universe (or God if you prefer) that supplies our good. We are merely giving back a small portion of what we have been blessed with, to gain even more abundance. A tithe is 10 percent.</p>
<p>So, in this way, someone who has nothing (literally) pays nothing (literally). Ten percent of zero is — zero! I do not charge a fee because I do not see this as a profit-making venture, but rather a vehicle to spread joy and abundance to people who need it.</p>
<p>My budget is as follows:</p>
<p>Editing, layout and book cover: $4,215</p>
<p>Website design, domain name, email, $1,840</p>
<p>Misc. $545</p>
<p>TOTAL $6,600</p>
<p>For investors/donors to my Indegogo campaign, I will offer autographed copies of my book, once it is available.</p>
<p>At higher donation levels, I will offer Zoom counselling sessions, from a 1.5 hour session all the way up to a full 12-week full-blown Prosperity Now! course for 8-10 people!</p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal, the funds I do receive will go toward making the course/book available to people all over the world who need a path out of poverty to success. If the goal is exceeded, there are plans to have the course translated into other languages!</p>
<h3> </h3>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I fully believe that the secrets to abundance and prosperity are not secret at all. They are just ways of seeing that are usually 180 degrees opposite of how people are taught to see things. <br/>By helping people see in a new way, I believe that these ideas will help make individual lives better, thus their families will improve, thus their neighborhood and community will be inspired and change, and then their nationand the whole world.</p>
<p>It is not the world that needs changing so much as how we see it, for when we “see it right” it changes before our very eyes! <br/> </p>
<p>I have helped 2 dozen people individually and in small groups, and the impact has been measurable. It is the right time to cast a wider net and help more people be free, to grow and have better, richer, fuller lives!</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will be put off by the emphasis on the Christian Bible. Others perhaps by my mention of Taoism, or A Course in Miracles, or 12-Step programs. Perhaps they will look unfavorably on my emphasis on tithing and money as a vehicle to open up consciousnesses. Perhaps they will cynically view this as just another “scam” to get rich by taking people’s money.</p>
<p>I cannot be affected by those energies, except to quote Herbert Spencer, “There is a principle...which cannot fail to keep [people] in everlasting ignorance — that principle is contempt prior to investigation.”</p>

<h3>Rising from Ashes</h3>
<p>I am writing novels under the name Matthew Bellwether, and had recently completed my debut novel, the first in a trilogy called <i>The Aethernet Chronicles</i>, when tragedy struck: we got news that the Glass Fire in Napa Valley had burned 30-40 acres and was located about 5 miles away from us.</p>
<p>Within days, the fire had grown to thousands of acres, then police came knocking on the door in the middle of the night and we were forced to evacuate. Within a few short hours, the flames had reached my house and surrounded it. From our temporary relocation, I helplessly watched firefighters on the news literally battling flames at my doorstep.</p>
<p>Our property was damaged, but still standing; we were one of the lucky ones. Many were not.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Serendipity &amp; Gratitude</h3>
<p>I was working on the manuscript for the second book in my trilogy when this disaster struck. Meanwhile, I had submitted my book to various literary agents and publishers, but I started getting little hints from the universe that maybe I needed to do something different:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Glass Fire appeared one day after I had just finished a chapter titled ""Rising from Ashes""</li>
<li>While evacuated, I was walking down a sidewalk and saw some random graffiti. The spray-painted message said ""Hello World"" -- this is the title of the very first chapter of my debut novel, <i>Alpha: Apparitions</i>!</li>
</ul>
<p>It made me feel like I needed to do something in return for the universe, something to show thanks for the mercy I had been given. So I decided to publish the novel immediately on Amazon via Kindle Direct Publishing, and decided to offer the book in exchange for donations </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Goal: Help Less Fortunate Victims</h3>
<p>I have chosen a few specific charitable causes to donate to, and I know people can donate directly, but sometimes it feels good to ""get a little something"" in return for the money you sacrifice. That's where my book comes in. With damage to my house and my wife going on four years of unemployment now (she had found employment earlier this year, only to lose it again to the pandemic), I don't have extra funds to donate to these worthy causes, but what I <i>can</i> offer is any proceeds my book could garner, and you can help me do that by purchasing the book or donating to these charitable organizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.cafirefoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The California Fire Foundation</a>, which provides assistance to firefighters, the families of fallen firefighters, and communities impacted by fire.</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://undocufund.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UndocuFund</a>, providing assistance and support to undocumented workers of Sonoma County and their families. Many of these laborers are counted amongst the ""essential workers"" that have kept our economy afloat, and they have already been greatly impacted by the pandemic... and now by the fires, too. </li>
<li>
<a href=""https://theroughdraught.com/category/dobetter/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Do Better Initiative</a>, a charitable initiative by Amanda Betsold, whose house (right next to ours) burned to ashes in the fire. Her mission has been to climb the Seven Summits (the highest peaks of each continent), each time raising money for a different charitable cause. This mission was already disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but losing her house has caused even further setback. Donating will help her achieve her goal of reaching the final summits to raise money for The National Park Foundation and The Joyful Heart Foundation for victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, and childhood trauma. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>The e-book version of <i>Alpha: Apparitions (The Aethernet Chronicles, Book 1) </i>is currently available for preorder and will be released on Halloween (October 31) By contributing to this campaign, you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>A free copy of my book in Kindle eBook format (note: You do <i>not </i>need a Kindle device to read this eBook. It can be viewed on any phone, tablet, laptop, or computer via the Kindle reader app or on the web)</li>
<li>A choice of charitable organization to support.</li>
<li>A good feeling from knowing that you helped others in need (via the charitable organizations listed above)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Get</h3>
<p>My first novel is already written, and the others will eventually be written, too. So what do I get out of it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Faith in humanity.</li>
<li>Knowing that people care.</li>
<li>A feeling that I could somehow help, when I have felt so helpless during the fires.</li>
<li>A way to repay a great debt that I feel I have to those who saved my home.</li>
<li>Motivation and support to write my second and third novels in the trilogy!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not interested in reading my novel, I encourage you to help in any way you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Donate directly to one of the above causes.</li>
<li>Share this campaign. Spread the word, especially to anybody who might like my story!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p><i>Alpha: Apparitions </i>is a supernatural cyberpunk thriller for young adults and the first book in <i>The Aethernet Chronicles</i> trilogy, taking place in a not-too-distant future, a “utopian” society in which science, technology, and progress reign supreme. There are Trad holdouts, but art, religion, mythology, and even history have been relegated to the realm of Esoteric knowledge, and much of it has been scrubbed from the Net by the Ministry of Information. Churches have been repurposed as community wifi beacons. Kids attend schools to specialize in biotechnology, robotics, rapid fabrication, and other high-tech fields.<br/><br/>Fifteen-year-old Alexandra Novak is an introverted girl who is abruptly uprooted from her comfortable life in Santa Fe and forced to move in with her Aunt Maddie in Seatac, Washington when her parents die in a tragic work mishap. Enrolled at NuVo High, she quickly begins to show prowess with the modern STEM-based world into which she has been thrust. Until, one day, things begin to go haywire. When a mysterious message appears on her vidgogs, followed by an explosive malfunction in her SoftDev class, she is plunged into even greater dangers.

</div></div>","Rising from Ashes
I am writing novels under the name Matthew Bellwether, and had recently completed my debut novel, the first in a trilogy called The Aethernet Chronicles, when tragedy struck: we got news that the Glass Fire in Napa Valley had burned 30-40 acres and was located about 5 miles away from us.
Within days, the fire had grown to thousands of acres, then police came knocking on the door in the middle of the night and we were forced to evacuate. Within a few short hours, the flames had reached my house and surrounded it. From our temporary relocation, I helplessly watched firefighters on the news literally battling flames at my doorstep.
Our property was damaged, but still standing; we were one of the lucky ones. Many were not.

Serendipity & Gratitude
I was working on the manuscript for the second book in my trilogy when this disaster struck. Meanwhile, I had submitted my book to various literary agents and publishers, but I started getting little hints from the universe that maybe I needed to do something different:

The Glass Fire appeared one day after I had just finished a chapter titled ""Rising from Ashes""
While evacuated, I was walking down a sidewalk and saw some random graffiti. The spray-painted message said ""Hello World"" -- this is the title of the very first chapter of my debut novel, Alpha: Apparitions!

It made me feel like I needed to do something in return for the universe, something to show thanks for the mercy I had been given. So I decided to publish the novel immediately on Amazon via Kindle Direct Publishing, and decided to offer the book in exchange for donations 

The Goal: Help Less Fortunate Victims
I have chosen a few specific charitable causes to donate to, and I know people can donate directly, but sometimes it feels good to ""get a little something"" in return for the money you sacrifice. That's where my book comes in. With damage to my house and my wife going on four years of unemployment now (she had found employment earlier this year, only to lose it again to the pandemic), I don't have extra funds to donate to these worthy causes, but what I can offer is any proceeds my book could garner, and you can help me do that by purchasing the book or donating to these charitable organizations:


The California Fire Foundation, which provides assistance to firefighters, the families of fallen firefighters, and communities impacted by fire.

UndocuFund, providing assistance and support to undocumented workers of Sonoma County and their families. Many of these laborers are counted amongst the ""essential workers"" that have kept our economy afloat, and they have already been greatly impacted by the pandemic... and now by the fires, too. 

The Do Better Initiative, a charitable initiative by Amanda Betsold, whose house (right next to ours) burned to ashes in the fire. Her mission has been to climb the Seven Summits (the highest peaks of each continent), each time raising money for a different charitable cause. This mission was already disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but losing her house has caused even further setback. Donating will help her achieve her goal of reaching the final summits to raise money for The National Park Foundation and The Joyful Heart Foundation for victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, and childhood trauma. 


What You Get
The e-book version of Alpha: Apparitions (The Aethernet Chronicles, Book 1) is currently available for preorder and will be released on Halloween (October 31) By contributing to this campaign, you get:

A free copy of my book in Kindle eBook format (note: You do not need a Kindle device to read this eBook. It can be viewed on any phone, tablet, laptop, or computer via the Kindle reader app or on the web)
A choice of charitable organization to support.
A good feeling from knowing that you helped others in need (via the charitable organizations listed above)

What I Get
My first novel is already written, and the others will eventually be written, too. So what do I get out of it?

Faith in humanity.
Knowing that people care.
A feeling that I could somehow help, when I have felt so helpless during the fires.
A way to repay a great debt that I feel I have to those who saved my home.
Motivation and support to write my second and third novels in the trilogy!


Other Ways You Can Help
If you're not interested in reading my novel, I encourage you to help in any way you can:

Donate directly to one of the above causes.
Share this campaign. Spread the word, especially to anybody who might like my story!


Synopsis
Alpha: Apparitions is a supernatural cyberpunk thriller for young adults and the first book in The Aethernet Chronicles trilogy, taking place in a not-too-distant future, a “utopian” society in which science, technology, and progress reign supreme. There are Trad holdouts, but art, religion, mythology, and even history have been relegated to the realm of Esoteric knowledge, and much of it has been scrubbed from the Net by the Ministry of Information. Churches have been repurposed as community wifi beacons. Kids attend schools to specialize in biotechnology, robotics, rapid fabrication, and other high-tech fields.Fifteen-year-old Alexandra Novak is an introverted girl who is abruptly uprooted from her comfortable life in Santa Fe and forced to move in with her Aunt Maddie in Seatac, Washington when her parents die in a tragic work mishap. Enrolled at NuVo High, she quickly begins to show prowess with the modern STEM-based world into which she has been thrust. Until, one day, things begin to go haywire. When a mysterious message appears on her vidgogs, followed by an explosive malfunction in her SoftDev class, she is plunged into even greater dangers. Alongside her one friend, the athletic-but-awkward Peter Figaretti (Fig), she narrowly escapes smart-taxis careening out of control, a mysterious figure who has stalked her all the way from New Mexico, and the ghost of her father during a bizarre virtual reality simulation. With her life going as haywire as the world around her, Alex is left curious, searching, and trying to survive the aftermath of the question: what actually happened to Jared and Lenasha Novak, and why is A.F.T.E.R. trying so hard to cover it up?",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Once upon a time...</h3>
<p>there was an awkward little kid who didn't understand why he fantasized about traveling back in time. Why he gave his Transformers middle names like Optimus Otis Prime. Why he convinced his friends he didn't cry and why that was such a bald-faced lie.  </p>
<p>What he didn't know at the time was that this little kiddo was a Cancer sun sign. </p>
<p>And... end rhyming sequence.</p>
<p>I always wondered how my childhood may have been different if I understood more about my Cancer sun sign at the age of seven instead of twenty-seven?</p>
<p>Astrology is a tool I wish so badly I had when I was a kid struggling to love all parts of myself. It’s for this reason that I created the first of its kind astrology-based children's book adventure series. ""The Little Crab Finds a Friend!"" is a fully colored, rhyming picture book series for ages (4-9) that follows a lost little crab on his journey home through an astrological land. </p>

88 - 96 pages (I will know the exact number of pages after the book design is ready for printing).
The accessible language, detailed illustrations, and engaging stories bring readers as young as three years into a world of fairy tales, while older readers and their parents can dig deeper into the region through the Ethnographic Notes, which offers the historical context for the story and detailed descriptions of places and customs. Additional activities let kids learn through hands-on activities and questions for discussion. The text is complemented by large, colorful illustrations filled with cultural details, which provide visual reference and convey the visual beauty of the region to the readers. This structure allows an individual to discover Central Asia gradually, through different types of learning: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.
This is the second book in a series.  ""Orange and Blue: The World of Barzu"" was the first book. It is available on Indiegogo . You can also order it as part of your Double, Triple, Four, Six books pack.

Children 3 - 12 years old. My goal has been to make this book interesting and understandable not only for children of all ages, but also for their parents. Thus, the book is divided into several parts: the story itself, which includes history and fable; folkloric narrative on how people really live; and an educational section at the end of the story for parents to discuss with their children. A long time ago, in a place where great roads crossed, stood the City of Blue Domes, with its narrow, winding streets and intricate mosaics decorating its high towers. The ruler of that city was the powerful Emir Bahriddin, the wisest of the wise and first among the just.One spring morning, Emir Bahriddin was reclining among his pillows in his Room of Thought. Ancient books in leather covers lined the shelves, maps of stars and land caravan routes hung on the walls. The room's large carved windows looked out onto a green, ever-blooming garden with cooling fountains.he emir liked to come to this room to ponder on life’s problems or think through an affair of State.  Here, with the song of birds drifting in from the garden, he could concentrate, search for answers in his books, and consult with learned elders.This time, Emir Bahriddin had a most difficult task to solve. Spring had finally come – the time for sowing in the fields – but after two years with poor harvests, the people had no seed to sow.  The ruler did not yet know how he would feed his subjects this year. It was in the midst of these sad thoughts that his wife found him. I have been working on this project for two years. In 2019, I travelled to the region for the research in the field, essential to the final product. I spoke to art experts, and craftspeople; visited crafts workshops and museums; took pictures, recorded video, and made sketches. All of this research was used directly in the story and illustrations, and in the Ethnographic Notes and activity sections of the book.In 2019, my book project “Introducing Central Asia through Children’s Literature” received Honorable Mention in the Public Outreach Award from Central Eurasian Studies Society.Marina Abrams – Author of book series, The World of Barzu; project director and founder of “Barzu World.” I was born and raised in Kazakhstan, lived in Tajikistan and Russia, and traveled extensively around the Eurasian region.

<div>Each month, Mexico’s extensive rail network unwillingly serves thousands of undocumented people from across Latin America and beyond. Apart from walking, this dangerous method of transportation is the only free ticket north for the passengers who are attempting to reach the United States. As La Bestia slowly traverses Mexico’s rugged landscape, these passengers are exposed to the subterranean environment of Mexico’s criminal and cartel underworld, often referred to as the ‘Cachuco’ industry - an illicit market that aims to profit from migrants in any way possible…</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Juan's story:</h3>
<p>""Juan first travelled alone from rural Guatemala to the United States in 1999 at the age of 14. To date, he has made the journey between the two countries six times. On his numerous rides atop La Bestia, he has witnessed other migrants lose limbs or fall to their death. He has been kidnapped, extorted and robbed by local gangs, drug cartels and even the police. A little over a year ago, he was pulled over on his way home from work at a fast food restaurant in Oklahoma, where his wife, sister and two children also live. The police officer asked Juan, “do you know why I pulled you over? Because you’re brown. I don’t like brown people”. Not being able to produce any documentation, he was deported after being held for months in an ICE detention facility. He will likely never be able to reunite with his family north of the border; but after twenty years in the US, he has nothing to return to in Guatemala either.""</p>

In the process of compiling a guide with rail information to help people travel on La Bestia, one of my collaborators was unfortunately kidnapped by the cartel in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.

This historical analysis will <strong>begin in the late 1800s,</strong> examining the United States involvement within Mexican economics and the Mexican revolution of 1910, as well as the creation of the Mexican rail network and its utilisation by US corporations operating in Latin America. </p><p>Continuing, the book will examine a series of complex US foreign policy-based decisions utilising disclosed government branch documents. This will begin with an analysis of the ‘Monroe Doctrine’ and its use in the ending of European colonial rule in Mexico, and how this doctrine was later repurposed to give the US more control over the economies and resources of Latin America. The book then explores the “Red Scare” era of American foreign policy after the Cuban revolution, and its attempts to quell the growth of socialism and communism in Latin America by any means necessary. This was to attempt to sustain the United States field of influence in the region over other political forces under the administrations of presidents ranging from Eisenhower to Clinton, as well as the involvements of Henry Kissinger and the lobbying of private companies.</p><p>In-depth case studies will be conducted showing CIA-led interventions in states with democratically elected socialist politicians to curb the spread of the ideology, by funding and often training many paramilitary right-wing groups which conducted mass killings and attempted forms of ethnic cleansing. This, in effect, will showcase how the destabilisation and suppression bred the perfect environment for illicit trade, the rise of the cartels, and the formation of the powerful gangs in the US which now control Central America and beyond, sustaining the mass Latin-American migration to the US of the past 60 years. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596629228/fdlsp17n1pxq1rcjrpb6.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Part 2 - Today’s Politics and Fieldwork:</h3><p>The second part of Sueño Americano will explore <strong>today's physical and political situation</strong> in Mexico, Central America and the US regarding migration. The book will examine recent policy making and political attitudes relating to migrants in Mexico and the US, as well as utilising extensive research and statistical data to highlight the situations and dangers for migrants while travelling across Mexico. The <strong>psychological implications</strong> of this journey will then be examined using case studies and original interviews by our collaborator in Chihuahua Mexico. Detailed accounts will be told of the journey and risks of La Bestia, interactions with police and criminal organisations, kidnappings, detentions by US police and help from Mexican organisations and individuals. Not only this, but personal accounts will be shared exploring the reasons that prompted migrants to leave their countries of origin in search of asylum. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595709395/h3vi3oegjydv2jgrtygo.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595854075/inhn7gfpfaejoz0rczhu.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595854111/djsuaugouvwmru9yjtog.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Part 3 - Personal Experiences:</h3><p>As well as what is already mentioned, the final part of the book will give some brief insight into <strong>my personal journey and motivations</strong> for undertaking this fieldwork, from the first time I rode a freight train at the age of 17, until my latest trip to Mexico.

Apart from walking, this dangerous method of transportation is the only free ticket north for the passengers who are attempting to reach the United States. As La Bestia slowly traverses Mexico’s rugged landscape, these passengers are exposed to the subterranean environment of Mexico’s criminal and cartel underworld, often referred to as the ‘Cachuco’ industry - an illicit market that aims to profit from migrants in any way possible…
 
Juan's story:
""Juan first travelled alone from rural Guatemala to the United States in 1999 at the age of 14. To date, he has made the journey between the two countries six times. On his numerous rides atop La Bestia, he has witnessed other migrants lose limbs or fall to their death. He has been kidnapped, extorted and robbed by local gangs, drug cartels and even the police. A little over a year ago, he was pulled over on his way home from work at a fast food restaurant in Oklahoma, where his wife, sister and two children also live. The police officer asked Juan, “do you know why I pulled you over? Because you’re brown. I don’t like brown people”. Not being able to produce any documentation, he was deported after being held for months in an ICE detention facility. He will likely never be able to reunite with his family north of the border; but after twenty years in the US, he has nothing to return to in Guatemala either.""
 The book:‘Sueño Americano’ is a short book (in A5) which explores personal stories and the greater political and historical implications of the Latin American migrant trail in Mexico to the US. More specifically, the book examines migration which utilises Mexico's extensive and dangerous freight train network, referred to simply as ‘La Bestia’ (The Beast), where up to 20,000 migrants are kidnapped each year, traversing some of the most violent regions in the world. Find the detailed description of the contents below.Almost all of the groundwork for the book is complete and with your backing, we can afford the upfront costs to print, distribute and advertise Sueño Americano on this pre-order basis, as well as pay the contributors for their work prior to shipping.The film:Also, as featured at the top of this fundraiser, a short film is being produced in conjunction with the booklet which will not be available publicly, but will be made available for backers of the book, and serves now as a video trailer for the Sueño Americano project as a whole. The final film will be between 15-20 minutes in length.Our mission:30% of all net proceeds will be donated to 14 individual charities and critical groups working to protect children separated from their families by ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement). Between October 2018 and September 2019, the journeys of 72,873 unaccompanied children ended with apprehension at the U.S. southwest border (UNICEF USA). For more information on the individual charities, click here.  A further 10% of the net proceeds will be donated to ‘Medicines Sans Frontières’ (Doctors Without Borders) for their humanitarian work with migrants and vulnerable people worldwide during this global pandemic, which has stretched medical resources further than any other period in recent history. Why would you be interested in Sueño Americano?To answer this question, we would like to borrow the words of the Salvadoran journalist and writer Óscar Martínez:“My proposal is that you know what is going on. What [people who are migrating to the US] are living through. Because I believe that knowing is different from not knowing. I believe that knowing … is the beginning of the solution. I believe, sticking with the metaphor of the sea [that erodes] the rock, that knowing is what moves the waves. You can be one of the waves.”I have invested many thousands of pounds into this project, excluding costs of equipment and labour time. We are not concerned with recouping this investment through the book, we merely wish to meet our expenses and generate funds for the aforementioned organisations, while raising awareness of migration in Mexico in a holistic context. There is a notable lack of media coverage for Latin American migration in the UK and Europe, which was one of the original motivations for this project. History of the project: Between the physical dangers of La Bestia, Mexico’s widespread criminal activity, and global quarantines, it has been a significant challenge to bring this project to life, which is the culmination of two years of first-hand research and four trips to the United States and Mexico. I am extremely grateful for the hospitality I recieved from strangers and friends alike in Mexico, Along with the input of my many collaborators, without whom, this project would not be possible. In the process of compiling a guide with rail information to help people travel on La Bestia, one of my collaborators was unfortunately kidnapped by the cartel in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. He survived and was returned to the US after this event, but this illustrates the risks anyone takes to get a glimpse of the world of Mexico’s most vulnerable. Despite global lockdowns, I was able to continue the research for this book, utilising the connections I had already made in Mexico and Central America. I am now conducting phone interviews from the UK to be able to finish the research for this project to the fullest extent. Contents:Part 1 - History and Context:Initially, Sueño Americano will contain a historical and socio-political exploration of the migration of many Latin Americans through Mexico to the USA. This historical analysis will begin in the late 1800s, examining the United States involvement within Mexican economics and the Mexican revolution of 1910, as well as the creation of the Mexican rail network and its utilisation by US corporations operating in Latin America. Continuing, the book will examine a series of complex US foreign policy-based decisions utilising disclosed government branch documents. This will begin with an analysis of the ‘Monroe Doctrine’ and its use in the ending of European colonial rule in Mexico, and how this doctrine was later repurposed to give the US more control over the economies and resources of Latin America. The book then explores the “Red Scare” era of American foreign policy after the Cuban revolution, and its attempts to quell the growth of socialism and communism in Latin America by any means necessary. This was to attempt to sustain the United States field of influence in the region over other political forces under the administrations of presidents ranging from Eisenhower to Clinton, as well as the involvements of Henry Kissinger and the lobbying of private companies.In-depth case studies will be conducted showing CIA-led interventions in states with democratically elected socialist politicians to curb the spread of the ideology, by funding and often training many paramilitary right-wing groups which conducted mass killings and attempted forms of ethnic cleansing. This, in effect, will showcase how the destabilisation and suppression bred the perfect environment for illicit trade, the rise of the cartels, and the formation of the powerful gangs in the US which now control Central America and beyond, sustaining the mass Latin-American migration to the US of the past 60 years. Part 2 - Today’s Politics and Fieldwork:The second part of Sueño Americano will explore today's physical and political situation in Mexico, Central America and the US regarding migration. The book will examine recent policy making and political attitudes relating to migrants in Mexico and the US, as well as utilising extensive research and statistical data to highlight the situations and dangers for migrants while travelling across Mexico. The psychological implications of this journey will then be examined using case studies and original interviews by our collaborator in Chihuahua Mexico. Detailed accounts will be told of the journey and risks of La Bestia, interactions with police and criminal organisations, kidnappings, detentions by US police and help from Mexican organisations and individuals. Not only this, but personal accounts will be shared exploring the reasons that prompted migrants to leave their countries of origin in search of asylum. Part 3 - Personal Experiences:As well as what is already mentioned, the final part of the book will give some brief insight into my personal journey and motivations for undertaking this fieldwork, from the first time I rode a freight train at the age of 17, until my latest trip to Mexico. We will explore some more detailed illustrated stories of my 100’s of hours of travel on La Bestia, as well as friends' and collaborators' stories of their own experiences travelling and riding freight trains in Mexico. Final Points:All text and research will be fully referenced, and resources for additional reading/viewing will also be included at the end, as well as a list of the charities we will donate to and a brief description of their work. Ultimately, Sueño Americano aims to serve both the casual reader with an interest in global migration and/or US/Mexico politics, and also provide a more holistic picture of why migration to the US exists in the way it does today for a more informed reader of the subject. Illustrations, Objects and Photos:All of this will be supported by a powerful collection of illustrations and photos from various authors, as well as stills from the film to represent the people interviewed in the fieldwork, as well as other situations that are discussed in the text. There will also be a series of photographs of physical objects collected by myself or others during the fieldwork as pictured below.Some Context Regarding Migration in Mexico (click for more info)Timeline:Below is the estimated timeline for the project development and production. We aim to print the first batch in November 2020, however, the timing is subject to changes in case of new lockdown/social distancing measures that might affect the production times. Contributors:Content creation:Mouse Green is an artist based in London, UK, who works with analogue and digital video, as well as photography and installation.
