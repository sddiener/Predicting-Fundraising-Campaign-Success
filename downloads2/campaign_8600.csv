<div>
<p>Thank you for your interest in participating in what we expect to be a continuous link to great American films that take place in New York City.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, my name is Sal Rinella. I have produced and directed over a dozen films, videos and shorts. I love what I do because the people I surround myself with love what they do, and they need this arena to continue creating great film works. As for importance, we are introducing a new voice to the Mob-Comedy Genre.  </li>
<li> We want to film in Corona, NY mid-July to mid-August.  <br/>
</li>
<li>
<div>“Good Friday"" is a motion picture, written and helmed by Sal Rinella, to be filmed in the New York City area. Mr. Rinella brings his storytelling passion to the film industry again. Your participation will make it possible for us to give this wonderful screenplay a first class film production.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need $50,000 for production, location rental, set building, lights, props, and salaries for our entire production team.  The amount of money we raise will directly impact the quality of the production. </li>
<li>Perks are in the Perks Section and are accessible to anyone who wants to help us.</li>
<li>We are committed to achieving this production.  <span><br/></span>
</li>
<li>Indie films usually aren’t as flashy as big Hollywood productions, but their small budgets mean that, if they hit big, they are hugely profitable. It also doesn’t hurt that they tend to be award magnets.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mob-flavored films have been a big favorite of the movie going public for years. The Mafia has been a source of some of the best stories in film history. The drama, action, and moral dilemmas the characters face always keep viewers on the edge of their seats, wanting more.</li>
<li>Mafia comedies revolve around the mafia and a comedic plot line, usually a chase or a complicated situation involving the Mafia. Examples of Mafia comedies include: <i>The Gang  That Couldn't Shoot Straight, Johnny Dangerously, Oscar, The Whole Nine Yards, Wise Guys, Corky Romano, The Freshman, Mickey Blue Eyes, Jane Austen's Mafia, Analyze This, Analyze That, and You Kill Me.</i> In <i>Bruges</i>, in which Colin Farrell stars, is also considered to be a Mafia comedy.</li>
<li>Many Crime/Gangster films involve a lot of comedic moments, especially during witty conversations between gang members. This can be seen in such films as <i>Goodfelllas, Johnny Stecchino, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Pulp Fiction.</i>
</li>
<li>A lot of the humor in such films is based upon the portrayal of gangsters as ordinary people. The perceived view of gangsters is that they are tough, serious, mysterious and often quite evil characters, so when a film portrays a side of normality to a gangster’s character, it can have a humorous effect. Father Bello is a good old-fashioned priest.<br/>.<br/>

</div></div>","Dear Family, Friends and Potential Angels,


Thank you for your interest in participating in what we expect to be a continuous link to great American films that take place in New York City.

Hi, my name is Sal Rinella. I have produced and directed over a dozen films, videos and shorts. I love what I do because the people I surround myself with love what they do, and they need this arena to continue creating great film works. As for importance, we are introducing a new voice to the Mob-Comedy Genre.  
 We want to film in Corona, NY mid-July to mid-August.  


“Good Friday"" is a motion picture, written and helmed by Sal Rinella, to be filmed in the New York City area. Mr. Rinella brings his storytelling passion to the film industry again. Your participation will make it possible for us to give this wonderful screenplay a first class film production.




What We Need & What You Get

We need $50,000 for production, location rental, set building, lights, props, and salaries for our entire production team.  The amount of money we raise will directly impact the quality of the production. 
Perks are in the Perks Section and are accessible to anyone who wants to help us.
We are committed to achieving this production.  

Indie films usually aren’t as flashy as big Hollywood productions, but their small budgets mean that, if they hit big, they are hugely profitable. It also doesn’t hurt that they tend to be award magnets.




The Impact

Mob-flavored films have been a big favorite of the movie going public for years. The Mafia has been a source of some of the best stories in film history. The drama, action, and moral dilemmas the characters face always keep viewers on the edge of their seats, wanting more.
Mafia comedies revolve around the mafia and a comedic plot line, usually a chase or a complicated situation involving the Mafia. Examples of Mafia comedies include: The Gang  That Couldn't Shoot Straight, Johnny Dangerously, Oscar, The Whole Nine Yards, Wise Guys, Corky Romano, The Freshman, Mickey Blue Eyes, Jane Austen's Mafia, Analyze This, Analyze That, and You Kill Me. In Bruges, in which Colin Farrell stars, is also considered to be a Mafia comedy.
Many Crime/Gangster films involve a lot of comedic moments, especially during witty conversations between gang members. This can be seen in such films as Goodfelllas, Johnny Stecchino, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Pulp Fiction.

A lot of the humor in such films is based upon the portrayal of gangsters as ordinary people. The perceived view of gangsters is that they are tough, serious, mysterious and often quite evil characters, so when a film portrays a side of normality to a gangster’s character, it can have a humorous effect. Father Bello is a good old-fashioned priest..




Risks & Challenges
The motion picture budget is composed of two parts: production and profit participation costs. A few key people involved in the making of “Good Friday” work at less than standard rates; the balance of their normal pay being deferred and paid out of profits. Deferment costs can be approximately 15 percent of the profits after investors are repaid 130 percent of their investment.

<br/><p><b>I've changed my mind. Can I get a refund?</b></p>
<p>Sorry, Indiegogo's policy is No Refunds. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about this. When your contribution is deposited into our account, it comes from Indiegogo, not from you. So if we were to refund your contribution, it wouldn't make it back to you.<a href=""https://go.indiegogo.com/playbook/contributing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Please see Indiegogo's rules here</a>.</p>

</div></div>","UPDATE: FUNDED(!!!) AND NEW STRETCH GOAL
$1800 
Thank you so much for donating! 
 are feeling all the love and want to let more people get on board and help out. 
We have decided to stretch for another $300! Used To: Hire a Professional Photographer/Videographer to cover our project!
NEW Perks!


$20 - Digital InkJet Print-  Ready to Frame. Created by Catherine.


Home III - $80 Perk
Introducing a great new perk for you for donating. 
Let's see how far we can get! 
Hello and welcome to our campaign page!
Allie is an artist living and working in the lovely Duluth, 
Minnesota. She received her degrees from Macalester College and The 
University of Kansas. 
She loves, in no particular order: creating Art, 
kayaking, American Modernist and Regionalist art styles, and cat videos 
on YouTube.



                      

Catherine is an artist and mother (wow!) living and working in Ames, 
Iowa. She received her degrees from Iowa State University and The 
University of Kansas. Her artistic voice is one of second chances. 
 She prays. She makes Art. 
She drinks coffee in the 
shower. 



 The Common Threads Exhibition is in reaction to the murals at Iowa State University by Grant Wood entitled When Tillage 
Begins,  and Other Arts Follow. 
See them here.
These murals, in their creation, execution, 
and viewing, inspire ideas of growth and discovery.
These themes are 
especially important in today’s context, and what better way to bring 
people together than to create a welcoming space full of art where you 
are encouraged to add to the installation piece?! 
The exhibition will be
 held at ISU Design On Main in Ames, Iowa.
October 1 - 31st, 2016.
 A variety of events will be included, such as 
artist talks, an interactive installation, drawing classes and more! 
By 
supporting this campaign, you aren’t just supporting a series of events;
 you are enabling community growth, education, and exploration.

  What We Need:  

$1,500

We are writing a grant to receive funding from the Iowa Arts Council Project Grant. The funding for this grant is contingent on a cash match for half of the requested amount. 
That is where this campaign comes in- we need to raise $1,500.00 in order to be qualified for receiving the grant funding.
The breakdown of what this campaign money will be used for is as follows:

Work time Snacks/Steady caffeine IV-drip (not REALLY, but just about) for artists for about 4 months $100




Domestic travel (i.e. multiple road trips) from Duluth, MN to Ames, IA and back for research and real time collaboration (includes more caffeine) $300


Various art materials such as natural indigo dye, gouache, and art markers for the 2-D collaborative pieces, and materials such as high-quality 4’ x 8’ plywood, nails, screws, sandpaper, and cotton thread for the installation piece $150


Marketing materials: posters and postcard designing, printing, and shipping.  Once we get this whole thing funded, we have to tell people to come! $50


Shipping!  Neither Allie nor Catherine can teleport themselves or objects, so we need to pay the good ‘ol USPS to ship the collaborative 2-D works back and forth with a small amount of insurance each time $80


Indiegogo perk art pieces and objects: making, packing, and shipping $200


Food for exhibit opening and various events (talks, performances, drawing classes, etc.) that will be hosted at ISU Design on Main throughout the month of October $250


And lastly, we need to pay ourselves the going rate for artists (Wow, I wish this happened more often!) $370

October 30 - 31, 2016 - Tear Down
Post-Exhibition: November-January 2017-Artists will skype weekly, organize and package up perks from the exhibit, ship those perks to YOU  by January 10, 2017, so that you can receive them in the mail by the middle-end of January (depending on where you live).   Other Ways You Can Help:
If you find yourself digging into your wallet only to discover it is woefully empty, never fear! You can still help us in a number of ways:

In-kind donations: if you have no cash, but you do have (for example) a crazy amount of unopened, delicious chocolate bars (we’re not judging!), you could donate those and we can serve them at our various events! Or it could be a box of screws! Or whatever, just let us know what you have and we’ll tell you if we could use it!
              
Make some noise, ya’ll! You know people that we don’t-tell them about this campaign and what a great thing it is we are doing…aww, we’re blushing!
Use the Indiegogo share tools to post about us on the internets and social media

Please consider a cash match or in-kind donation to make this exhibition a reality.

FAQ’S:
Can I get multiple perks?
Yes! You can back our campaign as many times as you want, choosing as many perks as you want.
Can I change my perk?
Unfortunately, not during the campaign. But before we send you your gear, we'll send you an email with a link to a system that will help you manage your perk, input your shipping information, and purchase add-ons if you choose.
I've changed my mind. Can I get a refund?
Sorry, Indiegogo's policy is No Refunds. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about this. When your contribution is deposited into our account, it comes from Indiegogo, not from you. So if we were to refund your contribution, it wouldn't make it back to you.Please see Indiegogo's rules here.
And that's all, folks! Please let us know if you have any other questions or comments.",19.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p><u>What is In/Visible?</u></p>
<p><b>In/Visible</b> was started in 2008 and is an investigation of
immigration in our communities. This multi-media installation includes video
projection onto as many as 53 handmade life size textile figures of cotton or
silk which act as a projection screen. The clothing is modeled after clothing
worn, and often left in the desert, by men and women crossing the US/Mexico
border on foot today. These figures represent past and present migrants while
the video offers first-hand stories and an opportunity for discovery of this
complicated discussion of migration.</p>
<p>A vital part of <b>In/Visible</b> is
the recorded interviews of personal immigration stories graciously shared with
us by people across the West, for example: a  gentleman living anonymously
in Tucson; ancestors of a Wyoming sugar beet farmer; a National Bilingual
Teacher-of-the-Year in Colorado; an Armenian American woman growing up in East
St Louis; a Japanese internment story; an 80-year-old-man
recounting his boyhood immigration from Scandinavia. These stories and
others, combined with personally collected imagery, are woven together by Mark
Conkle and projected onto the figures which act as a projection screen offering
visitors an opportunity of discovery, in the work and in themselves.</p>
<p><u>The budget:</u></p>

<p>In ""FluMental"" I try to capture the invisible positive energy around us that we often forget about and pass it on to anyone looking at my paintings. I’d like to remind the viewers that we’re all connected even when we’re physically far away from each other. My goal is to make them submerge in a magical space that may be even more real than our perceived surroundings and remind them that everything is possible.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>At the core of quantum physics is the idea that the forms and sizes of objects in the Universe depend on the viewer’s perception. This idea is very different from the Philosophical Realism of the ancient Greeks who believed that everything in the Universe exists in and of itself, independent of human consciousness. The theory of quantum physics seems closer to the one of Idealism where it’s believed that reality is a form of the human mind. It can take on a variety of different forms because both consciousness and matter consist of pure energy.</p>

These “Fluctuations” can take on different, unusual shapes that can also remind of creatures from the sea depths or the microcosmos. They are everywhere around us. They react to us and change based on our thoughts and moods. They float in a different substance with lighted spaces on the background, in city landscapes, some of which are more homogeneous and others more dynamic.   </p>

Edward and his team will use traditional methods and specialised techniques for this extraordinary heritage project. Their work will allow everyone who comes in contact with the wagon to appreciate the craftsmanship and traditional travelling homes of Gypsies and Circus people alike, a sight that is now so rarely seen out of a museum or a Glamping catalogue.   </span></p>

We want to take brilliant performance, out of the traditional setting, onto the road and into communities creating a meeting place for sharing stories that are intimate, informative, imaginative and inspired.
Please join us and make this happen...

We need your help to restore the wagon to its former glory, build a bespoke stage and get out into the world (not to a museum!) to bring stories and magic to back streets and forgotten corners of the country.

The caravan was first built to house a circus performer's family in 1892 and moonlighted fifty years later as a horse driven tea room when two intrepid young women refurbished it to mark the end of WWII.
Now, it in its third century it is being reborn, this time as a travelling stage - going to the places most theatres can’t get to. 

 
 The Theatre will be a captivating platform bringing together the best international story-telling, theatre, cabaret, poetry, music and talks.  Artists who travel with the Gypsy Caravan Theatre will engage with the community. The people who live where the caravan arrives will become part of the worlds these artists create. Audiences will be enthralled and excited and most importantly, connected.

<h4>About</h4>
<p>BPBD (Best Portuguese Book Designs) is a project established by six Portuguese Graphic Designers working between Lisbon, Porto and Amsterdam. Together, we are Ricardo Leite, Marta Veludo, João Santos, João Martins, João Sousa and João Simões.</p>
<p>Book contests are an important cultural mark in countries such as Holland, Switzerland, France, England, Belgium, etc. Each country recognises what arethe most beautifully designed books and thus presents them to the world, spreading and preserving their cultural heritage whilst also taking influence from abroad. We decided to implement the same idea in Portugal, to give an insight into an editorial practice throughout a range of years with the intention to archive a part of our national history. </p>
<p>Our campaign is aimed at raising the necessary in order to achieve the dream of Best Portuguese Book Designs. For this project to be realised, we will need your support to make the exhibition happen. It will take place in 2015 in Portugal, and it will be designed with the help of industrial Portuguese design studio Galula (<a href=""http://www.galulastudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #2bb673;"" target=""_blank"">www.galulastudio.com</a>). To make the exhibition complete, we will print an edition of 500 catalogues, featuring essays and articles of critics, designers and publishers, both nationally and internationally recognised.</p>
<p>Your contribution can make our dreams become a reality. With your help, we can start BPBD and reveal to the world the great quality of design that is made in Portugal. With your support, we can build a public exhibition that has the high quality, which this project deserves. From this, we can produce our catalogue in collaboration with five esteemed printing companies, and thus create a beautiful and memorable object.</p>
<p>Our ambition is to spread the BPBD catalogue to as many places as possible, including museums, institutions and bookshops. </p>

<br/><p></p>
<p><b>Our Rewards<b> </b></b></p>
<p>The BPBD rewards are an ode to the print and book universe. You can join us in this fantastic adventure from only placing your name on our website, to purchasing the exhibition. You would be buying a part of history and precious design material that defines Portuguese design from 2010-2013! Check them out, we have wonderful goodies too! If we can't reach the goal, the funds are going to be spent building the exhibition in the best way possible. The catalogue will be in a cheaper format, or only with digital presence.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>By supporting BPBD 2010-13, you will be a part of a renowned Portuguese organisation. With your help, we can fill the gap in design culture in Portugal. We would also like to export Portuguese design in an editorial format. We believe in the quality and excellence of what is made in our country and the necessity that we have to show ourselves internationally. This is one of the reasons why we present ourselves as bilingual. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Through our professional occupations in the design, we have plenty of experience managing the production process from the initial stages of the writer’s draft through to design, layout, proofing and finally printing. For the exhibition design, we are working closely with Galula Studio. With your help, we are confident that we can deliver this exhibition and catalogue to the highest standard.</p>
<p>To be able to make the BPBD exhibition and catalogue, we really need to reach the €9,000 target trough this Indiegogo campaign. Donations beyond this target will help us enormously with covering distribution costs and making sure the exhibition and catalogue are exceptional beyond reproach. We believe in the importance of BPBD in the national design culture.</p>

</div></div>","About
BPBD (Best Portuguese Book Designs) is a project established by six Portuguese Graphic Designers working between Lisbon, Porto and Amsterdam. Together, we are Ricardo Leite, Marta Veludo, João Santos, João Martins, João Sousa and João Simões.
Book contests are an important cultural mark in countries such as Holland, Switzerland, France, England, Belgium, etc. Each country recognises what arethe most beautifully designed books and thus presents them to the world, spreading and preserving their cultural heritage whilst also taking influence from abroad. We decided to implement the same idea in Portugal, to give an insight into an editorial practice throughout a range of years with the intention to archive a part of our national history. 
Our campaign is aimed at raising the necessary in order to achieve the dream of Best Portuguese Book Designs. For this project to be realised, we will need your support to make the exhibition happen. It will take place in 2015 in Portugal, and it will be designed with the help of industrial Portuguese design studio Galula (www.galulastudio.com). To make the exhibition complete, we will print an edition of 500 catalogues, featuring essays and articles of critics, designers and publishers, both nationally and internationally recognised.
Your contribution can make our dreams become a reality. With your help, we can start BPBD and reveal to the world the great quality of design that is made in Portugal. With your support, we can build a public exhibition that has the high quality, which this project deserves. From this, we can produce our catalogue in collaboration with five esteemed printing companies, and thus create a beautiful and memorable object.
Our ambition is to spread the BPBD catalogue to as many places as possible, including museums, institutions and bookshops. 
To achieve this goal, your help is invaluable.
Our funds will be mainly used for three things1. A printed catalogue with a print run of 500, including all the production costs and translations. 
2. The exhibition design, including materials, structural design and transportation. 
3. Indiegogo Rewards and Postage.








Our Rewards 
The BPBD rewards are an ode to the print and book universe. You can join us in this fantastic adventure from only placing your name on our website, to purchasing the exhibition. You would be buying a part of history and precious design material that defines Portuguese design from 2010-2013! Check them out, we have wonderful goodies too! If we can't reach the goal, the funds are going to be spent building the exhibition in the best way possible. The catalogue will be in a cheaper format, or only with digital presence.
The Impact
By supporting BPBD 2010-13, you will be a part of a renowned Portuguese organisation. With your help, we can fill the gap in design culture in Portugal. We would also like to export Portuguese design in an editorial format. We believe in the quality and excellence of what is made in our country and the necessity that we have to show ourselves internationally. This is one of the reasons why we present ourselves as bilingual. 
Risks & Challenges
Through our professional occupations in the design, we have plenty of experience managing the production process from the initial stages of the writer’s draft through to design, layout, proofing and finally printing. For the exhibition design, we are working closely with Galula Studio. With your help, we are confident that we can deliver this exhibition and catalogue to the highest standard.
To be able to make the BPBD exhibition and catalogue, we really need to reach the €9,000 target trough this Indiegogo campaign. Donations beyond this target will help us enormously with covering distribution costs and making sure the exhibition and catalogue are exceptional beyond reproach. We believe in the importance of BPBD in the national design culture.
Other Ways You Can Help
You can share our campaign with your friends! Every contribution is valuable to make this happen. 
Thank you for taking the time to read about Best Portuguese Book Designs 2010-13. 
We hope you will consider contributing and share the project with all your friends.

find a timeless design you love to look at every day. The complex yet
simple polygon structure reflects the <b>modern design-approach</b>. The Papertrophy animals
feature a minimalistic cubic design. It represents simplicity while offering an
astonishing look through shadows and light on the trophies. Their bright and
vibrant colors create depth and radiate an extravagant elegance. <br/>I designed <b>five stand up figures and five wall hanging trophies</b>. <br/><br/>You can <b>choose one of the pre-colored designs</b> (with two colors per Papertrophy, you can choose between 80 color-options per trophy!) <b>or build the
white version</b>, which is offering a wide
possibility for personalization. Either way <b>you will get a</b> <b>beautiful piece of art</b>
that simply makes your living room, kitchen or study just look so much better.
They are also an excellent gift-idea for people who just like nice things around them :)

</div><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><p></p></div>","Dear supporters, thanks a lot for all your help, patience and support! After a great campaign I just opened the regular online shop for all the Papertrophies you see here and even more. Please visit www.papertrophy.com if you are interesed in buying one of the Papertrophies.  
A collection of beautiful Papercraft Art for
your home.
And, in a special Perk, the XXL-Size Mighty-Gorilla: As requested from our fans there are now two new XL-Size Papertrophies availabe!The XL-Elk is 110cm (43,31'') tall, the XL-Penguin about 81cm (31,89'') Inspired by the classic animal trophies I set out to
find a timeless design you love to look at every day. The complex yet
simple polygon structure reflects the modern design-approach. The Papertrophy animals
feature a minimalistic cubic design. It represents simplicity while offering an
astonishing look through shadows and light on the trophies. Their bright and
vibrant colors create depth and radiate an extravagant elegance. I designed five stand up figures and five wall hanging trophies. You can choose one of the pre-colored designs (with two colors per Papertrophy, you can choose between 80 color-options per trophy!) or build the
white version, which is offering a wide
possibility for personalization. Either way you will get a beautiful piece of art
that simply makes your living room, kitchen or study just look so much better.
They are also an excellent gift-idea for people who just like nice things around them :)

Hundreds of polygons fit perfectly inside each other and
build a sturdy construction using nothing more then paper and glue. It's
astonishing how solid the final product is if you see the single paper elements
used to build it. The models are so
solid in the end; you might even want to wear them as masks for your next Halloween
party!
I use only heavy, high quality papers of at least
220g/m2 (as a reference: your regular printer paper is 80g/m2), handpicked from German paper manufactories. All papers are eco friendly and carry the FSC seal.Building Papertrophies is easy. It just takes some
time and regular paper glue. The final product arrives not only pre-cut but with
pre-creased folding patterns at your doorstep. That makes folding super easy.
You don‘t even need complicated and long instructions: Simply glue the numbered
pieces together and the final product will magically appear piece by piece in
your hand.Once all flaps are glued together you see the initial
paper-parts transforming into a three-dimensional artwork ready to be hung
on the wall and displayed.Design is a very important factor for everything I
do. I studied every single polygon, cut line and flap. My goal was not only
to perfect the look but also to ensure that building it will be straightforward
and as easy as possible. In the end I was able to set up every single
Papertrophy elegant, yet easy to build. You don‘t need a blueprint or
complicated instructions. Theoretically you don‘t even have to know what kind
of animal you are building - the figures form themselves. Some say its like
magic :)  To make sure that you will build a perfect Papertrophy
every package contains a training sheet. That means you can try out your long
forgotten gluing-skills from your childhood before start building the real
Papertrophy!Instead of just sending out a training sheet everybody who orders a Papertrophy (excluding downloads)now gets our  guinea pig for free!That's right: Order a Papertrophy now and you get this adorable pig for free!
Papertrophies are designed in Berlin, Germany,  machine-cut and pre-fold from high quality eco-friendly paper
for precision and quality by local printers. Every papercraft is checked
manually to ensure that only perfectly cut and pre-folded models receive the
official Papertrophy seal.I worked hard to optimize the complex
polygon design without compromising the user-friendly building-process. Over
the last few months I prototyped many different options and settled for the
perfect size, look and use of material.
I didn‘t just want to send out sheets of paper.
Cutting hundreds of polygons takes a lot of time and tools (around seven hours
for one trophy by hand - believe me I built quite a few ;) ) 
But more important you have to be very precise in cutting when you do it by hand as
small mistakes of a fraction of a millimeter add up fast to an unsatisfied
experience in the end.That's why for the mass customization I'm are going to use
professional industrial style plotters and die molds to ensure the highest grade of quality
possible while shortening the building process.  The final product arrives not only pre-cut but with
pre-creased folding patterns at your doorstep. 
I came up with the idea for Papertrophy because I was tired of looking at 2D posters and framed paintings on the walls. I also like
to travel and love to see wild animals in their natural habitat. So I set to

A local photographer, Deborah Jutz (BluView Photography) and a bunch of volunteers got together on a sunny Friday afternoon for a photoshoot. The idea is to show REAL people enjoying the BREWVANA experience in color, on top of the background.  The people are all wearing nametags and pretzel necklaces and holding beer with happy faces. BREWVANA is not just about the beer, it's really about the people. The plan is to have the images of the people in color, along with the BREWVANA logo on top of the collage of the environment of beer in Portland in the background. Here are the people we shot:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/95465/files/20130925110441-buspeople.jpg?1380132281"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Photographer Aaron Filipowsky (ASF Shoots) has taken photos for us to use in the design including hops, barley, water, mountains, water, benson bubblers, bikes, bridges,  kegs, etc- any images he could find to build the environment of craft beer in Portland and the Northwest.  Next, our bus art designer, Cassandra Stemler is responsible for the design portion. First, she had to measure the buses to know what her canvas looked like. </p>

Goal: To transform our buses into iconic mobile pieces of art that inspire people to appreciate craft beer.
What Is The Project All About?
Our mission is raise enough funds to so that we can get two full decal wraps as well as the necessary mechanical repairs for our two short buses, Angel & Rosie.  The project will require a collaboration of many people working together to make it happen. Our vision is to have these buses embody the spirit of craft beer and the environment of Portland by being cultural landmarks for both visitors and locals. 
We have already begun the process. A local photographer, Deborah Jutz (BluView Photography) and a bunch of volunteers got together on a sunny Friday afternoon for a photoshoot. The idea is to show REAL people enjoying the BREWVANA experience in color, on top of the background.  The people are all wearing nametags and pretzel necklaces and holding beer with happy faces. BREWVANA is not just about the beer, it's really about the people. The plan is to have the images of the people in color, along with the BREWVANA logo on top of the collage of the environment of beer in Portland in the background. Here are the people we shot:


Next, we need to create the background, the environment. Photographer Aaron Filipowsky (ASF Shoots) has taken photos for us to use in the design including hops, barley, water, mountains, water, benson bubblers, bikes, bridges,  kegs, etc- any images he could find to build the environment of craft beer in Portland and the Northwest.  Next, our bus art designer, Cassandra Stemler is responsible for the design portion. First, she had to measure the buses to know what her canvas looked like. 



Whoa- thats a HUGE canvas! The next step is to take the photos as well as other images and collage them together to create the art.





And that’s how far we’ve gotten with the project. We are currently working on finalizing the design. The next step is to fix the repairs on the vehicles,  produce the wraps, apply them, and start rolling!
Just as water is to beer, our buses are to our business- we couldn’t make it without them! Our buses safely transport beer enthusiasts to and from breweries while providing the Ultimate Craft Beer Tour Experience. Now it’s time to show them some love with mechanical repairs as well as full decal wraps so they’re up to snuff with a brand spankin’ new look. These buses will truly represent the BREWVANA experience and our brand.
What Is the Cost Of This Project?
Our goal of $10,000 will pay for the following:
          -Creation of the bus art design
          -Repairs to the vehicle
          -Production and application of the wraps
Our stretch goal of $25,000 will pay for the following:  
          -An additional vehicle  
          -Permits and licenses to extend tours to Washington

<p>Earlier this year, I was chosen to be a part of a select few in John Ross Palmer’s Escapist Mentorship program while attending Millikin University for my BFA. Being the first and only Millikin student to be selected as an Escapist has been a monumental moment in my career and has set me up for success as an artist. The Escapist program is based out of John's home base of Houston, TX, while I currently live in St Louis, MO. What's becoming astonishingly clear during my time as an Escapist is that I need to physically travel to Houston to meet John. </p>
<p>In October, John hosts his annual Black Tie Gala, an exhibition event in which all of his Escapist mentees mingle with John, each other, and John's collectors who help support his  painting career. Meeting all of these people is the next step in my path and will open doors in terms of my professional success. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">By backing me, you are not only helping me to fund both myself and my art getting down to Texas, you’re helping a young artist materialize his dream.

<h3>Dear Indiegogo-ers:<br/>
</h3>
<p>Welcome to my second Indiegogo campaign in support my memoir in progress ""<i>Point &amp; Shoot-The Death of Photography""</i>. My name is Paul Perrier and I am a photographer/filmmaker born and raised in Montréal and now living in Toronto, Canada. After backpacking through Europe and the Middle East with a 35 mm camera in 1981-82, I returned home and had to make a decision on what to do with my life? One of the photographs I took on this journey called ""<i>The Gates</i>""  led me to a decision to pursue photography and attempt to make a career out of it. It has been a long strange trip ever since and the reason for writing my story. It took a long time for me to understand that being a photographer is more than making pictures ... <i>it is a way of life</i>. Not exactly a normal way of life either. The art of photography is taking a negative and changing it into a positive. This process is achieved in the dark, through which light always shines.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/38517/files/20130828070337-gates.jpg?1377698617"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My background:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Upon my return to Montreal after my backpacking trek, I studied photography at <i>The Dawson Institute of Photography </i>for two years in the mid 1980's and then set out to pursue my dream. It has been proven that to become good at anything one must put an average 10,000 hours of practice into it. From 1985 until 1999, I did my time and then some, while making hundreds of thousands of photographic images. Just as I felt I was beginning to master my craft and build a business, I sensed a change was on the way that would cause a wave of disruption in my career path - <i>Digital Imaging</i>. It was at this time that I decided to take advantage of the same emerging new digital technology in documentary filmmaking to expand my story telling options. With no experience in the field and with the help of some knowledgeable friends, I documented the events on video and through still photographs at my high school's 22nd year reunion in August of 1999, at the <i>Queen Elizabeth Hotel</i> in Montreal. My instincts were correct and on October 31st, 2000 my first film ""<i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7B76Q8q9ys)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marymount Again...</a>""</i> was broadcast before a national audience in Canada on CBC's <i>""Rough Cuts"". </i></p>
<p>The experience was a refreshing change for me and it began to lead me in new artistic and career directions. By 2002 digital photography was taking over the landscape and I shot my last portfolio series on 35 mm film called <i>""<a href=""http://www.blatantexposure.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Lost Vegas Art Project</a>""  </i>later that year before going to the <i>other side</i>.</p>

<p style=""""><font color=""#222222""><font><font class=""Apple-style-span"">On Thursday August 14, 2003 I documented the evening of the ""<i>Big Blackout</i>"" </font><font class=""Apple-style-span"">with a night vision camera. The result was an experimental short film I called ""Maybe the Big rabbit Did it ?"" which was only screened once at the 'New York Independent Film festival' in 2004. Later that year I was one of six people selected as ""Canada's most promising filmmakers"" to participate in Allan King's ill fated ""Documentary Studio"". Unfortunately I never got to finish my film </font><font class=""Apple-style-span"">""<i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxvPPK15kAc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Melody Ranch - The Last Matinée.</a></i>"" </font></font></font></p>

My life would take, what I can only describe as a twist of fate, </font></font><font style=""font-size: 15px;"">on February 24'th, 2004 when I answered a phone call from a friend who wanted me to interview her on camera, in a dingy room at the Bay Street Motel</font><font style=""font-size: 15px;""> in Toronto as she spoke honestly about her life  as a drug addict. ""<a href=""http://www.snagfilms.com/films/title/cracked_not_broken"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cracked Not Broken""</a></font><font style=""font-size: 15px;""> a real time and unplanned documentary, was screened at the Regent Theatre </font><font style=""font-size: 15px;"">in Toronto for friends and family on September 12th, 2005. Nine months to the day later it </font><font style=""font-size: 15px;"">was featured on the 'Oprah Winfrey Show"" </font><font style=""font-size: 15px;"">and was one of four independent films selected to be broadcast as part of HBO""s Award winning ""Addiction Series"" in 2007.</font><font style=""font-size: 15px;""><br/><br/>

Which leads to this book project in 2013. <a href=""http://news.fredericksburg.com/business/2013/02/01/technologys-eating-jobs-faster-than-we-can-replace-them/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Technology</a> continues to change many lives and careers throughout the world at a rapid pace. It continues to eliminate more jobs than creating new ones. </font></font></span></font></p>
<p><font size=""5""><span style=""font-size: 15.0px;""><font color=""#222222""><font>Book publishing is now experiencing the same radical disruptions that photography and music each went through and is the reason that I decided to independently promote, fund and release this book through Indiegogo. The great aspect of this technological advancement is the relationship it allows between the audience and the artist. This allows for artistic control over the content. The audience can put their money where their preferences lie instead of relying on an institution to make decisions for them. This can can only lead to more interesting work being released. <br/><br/>
There are some changes that I made since finishing my first campaign. The most important is that I will only produce physical</font><font> copies of the book and not release it as an</font></font></span><span style=""font-size: 15.0px;""><font color=""#222222""><font> e-Book. There are  a few reasons for this. I still feel that actual books are cooler than electronic books, much as printed photographs are cooler than digital images and record albums are cooler than song files. The tactile quality of each add to the sense of the stories being expressed. I hope you conside</font><font>r ea</font><font>ch tome a piece of affo</font><font>rdab</font><font>le Art that you can add to your library of books stored on your shelves so that the future generations will remember what a book was. <br/><br/>
Another change I decided to make was to include everyone's </font></font></span><span style=""font-size: 15.0px;""><font color=""#222222""><font>name in the book </font></font></span><span style=""font-size: 15.0px;""><font color=""#222222""><font>who help me reach my goal. For as little as $ 1.00 your name will live on for ever inside the pages of my artistic release. That's good bang for your buck !<br/><br/>
I also set two very ambitious goals for this final campaign. During the 33 day period of that it runs, I plan to finish writing the book. I have gathered most of the images that I will use as context and I am eventually figuring out the flow from the beginning, to the end of the book. Some of the chapters I plan to pen feature behind the scenes stories from some interesting photo assignments I did with some iconic characters of t</font></font></span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 15px;"">he 20th century<span style=""font: 16.0px Arial;""> including</span>:  <i>""Shooting Bill Gates"" -  ""Bill Hicks-The Prince of Darkness."" - ""My Lunch with George Plimpton."" - ""St. Nick Nolte"" - ""The Eye of Storm Thorgerson."" - ""The Drowning"" - ""Snake Eyes."" - ""Lost &amp; Profound"" - ""The Wizard of Oprah""  and many more.</i></span><span style=""font-size: 15.0px;""><font color=""#222222""><font><br/></font><font>
<br/>
The second goal is to pre-sell 5,000 copies of the book, which would classify it as a ""Canadian Best</font><font> Seller' without ever being in a bookstore. That would be a cool story! <br/><br/>
The writing aspect I now believe I am getting a handle on. Through lots of bad writing, I believe that I have found my written voice? I guarantee it won't be the most literate voice in writing but it will be original. My photography and film work has appeared in the public eye in various forms since the beginning of my career. Some of these works have been subject to criticism and rarely if ever, in my case, is the voice of the person who created the work ever heard. I have kept my eyes open and mouth shut for a long time ... I now have some things to say.<br/><br/>

</div></div>","Dear Indiegogo-ers:

Welcome to my second Indiegogo campaign in support my memoir in progress ""Point & Shoot-The Death of Photography"". My name is Paul Perrier and I am a photographer/filmmaker born and raised in Montréal and now living in Toronto, Canada. After backpacking through Europe and the Middle East with a 35 mm camera in 1981-82, I returned home and had to make a decision on what to do with my life? One of the photographs I took on this journey called ""The Gates""  led me to a decision to pursue photography and attempt to make a career out of it. It has been a long strange trip ever since and the reason for writing my story. It took a long time for me to understand that being a photographer is more than making pictures ... it is a way of life. Not exactly a normal way of life either. The art of photography is taking a negative and changing it into a positive. This process is achieved in the dark, through which light always shines.


My background:

Upon my return to Montreal after my backpacking trek, I studied photography at The Dawson Institute of Photography for two years in the mid 1980's and then set out to pursue my dream. It has been proven that to become good at anything one must put an average 10,000 hours of practice into it. From 1985 until 1999, I did my time and then some, while making hundreds of thousands of photographic images. Just as I felt I was beginning to master my craft and build a business, I sensed a change was on the way that would cause a wave of disruption in my career path - Digital Imaging. It was at this time that I decided to take advantage of the same emerging new digital technology in documentary filmmaking to expand my story telling options. With no experience in the field and with the help of some knowledgeable friends, I documented the events on video and through still photographs at my high school's 22nd year reunion in August of 1999, at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal. My instincts were correct and on October 31st, 2000 my first film ""Marymount Again..."" was broadcast before a national audience in Canada on CBC's ""Rough Cuts"". 
The experience was a refreshing change for me and it began to lead me in new artistic and career directions. By 2002 digital photography was taking over the landscape and I shot my last portfolio series on 35 mm film called ""The Lost Vegas Art Project""  later that year before going to the other side.




On Thursday August 14, 2003 I documented the evening of the ""Big Blackout"" with a night vision camera. The result was an experimental short film I called ""Maybe the Big rabbit Did it ?"" which was only screened once at the 'New York Independent Film festival' in 2004. Later that year I was one of six people selected as ""Canada's most promising filmmakers"" to participate in Allan King's ill fated ""Documentary Studio"". Unfortunately I never got to finish my film ""Melody Ranch - The Last Matinée."" 


My life would take, what I can only describe as a twist of fate, on February 24'th, 2004 when I answered a phone call from a friend who wanted me to interview her on camera, in a dingy room at the Bay Street Motel in Toronto as she spoke honestly about her life  as a drug addict. ""Cracked Not Broken"" a real time and unplanned documentary, was screened at the Regent Theatre in Toronto for friends and family on September 12th, 2005. Nine months to the day later it was featured on the 'Oprah Winfrey Show"" and was one of four independent films selected to be broadcast as part of HBO""s Award winning ""Addiction Series"" in 2007.
It was the last film that I have made. 
On June 29, 2007 the first generation Apple I-Phone was introduced. Besides causing a revolution in smart phone business, it would prove to be 'the nail in the coffin' for most professional photographers. The Tsunami had reached the shore and it's effects to the business of photography were the same as an actual tsunami ... total devastation.
Every disaster will lead to something..

Which leads to this book project in 2013. Technology continues to change many lives and careers throughout the world at a rapid pace. It continues to eliminate more jobs than creating new ones. 
Book publishing is now experiencing the same radical disruptions that photography and music each went through and is the reason that I decided to independently promote, fund and release this book through Indiegogo. The great aspect of this technological advancement is the relationship it allows between the audience and the artist. This allows for artistic control over the content. The audience can put their money where their preferences lie instead of relying on an institution to make decisions for them. This can can only lead to more interesting work being released. 
There are some changes that I made since finishing my first campaign. The most important is that I will only produce physical copies of the book and not release it as an e-Book. There are  a few reasons for this. I still feel that actual books are cooler than electronic books, much as printed photographs are cooler than digital images and record albums are cooler than song files. The tactile quality of each add to the sense of the stories being expressed. I hope you consider each tome a piece of affordable Art that you can add to your library of books stored on your shelves so that the future generations will remember what a book was. 
Another change I decided to make was to include everyone's name in the book who help me reach my goal. For as little as $ 1.00 your name will live on for ever inside the pages of my artistic release. That's good bang for your buck !
I also set two very ambitious goals for this final campaign. During the 33 day period of that it runs, I plan to finish writing the book. I have gathered most of the images that I will use as context and I am eventually figuring out the flow from the beginning, to the end of the book. Some of the chapters I plan to pen feature behind the scenes stories from some interesting photo assignments I did with some iconic characters of the 20th century including:  ""Shooting Bill Gates"" -  ""Bill Hicks-The Prince of Darkness."" - ""My Lunch with George Plimpton."" - ""St. Nick Nolte"" - ""The Eye of Storm Thorgerson."" - ""The Drowning"" - ""Snake Eyes."" - ""Lost & Profound"" - ""The Wizard of Oprah""  and many more.

The second goal is to pre-sell 5,000 copies of the book, which would classify it as a ""Canadian Best Seller' without ever being in a bookstore. That would be a cool story! 
The writing aspect I now believe I am getting a handle on. Through lots of bad writing, I believe that I have found my written voice? I guarantee it won't be the most literate voice in writing but it will be original. My photography and film work has appeared in the public eye in various forms since the beginning of my career. Some of these works have been subject to criticism and rarely if ever, in my case, is the voice of the person who created the work ever heard. I have kept my eyes open and mouth shut for a long time ... I now have some things to say.
As with most artists, I could always benefit from any and all help in the promotion, marketing and selling departments. Obviously any contribution is welcome but there are other ways to help as well. Sharing the project. I have always felt that 'word of mouth' is the most credible form of advertising or marketing because people who don't stand to gain personally by promoting something, put their reputations on the line every time they make a recommendation. The technological abilities to do this on social networks like Facebook and Twitter et al, make this a simple process.  The more personal the better. Every time someone clicks on the campaign it helps raise the traction of the project on Indiegogo which in turn helps it get viewed by more people. I am open to bartering also. Maybe you can provide a service that would help me in promoting the project (PR/ leads to radio, newspaper or blogger interviews etc). Perhaps you own an isolated old hotel where I could seclude myself and go mad pounding out a masterpiece like Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining"" ?
Speaking about personal. I plan to take the campaign out onto the streets of Toronto during the campaign to perform some impromptu readings of ""The Gates"" accompanied by the original framed print. If it worked for the Queen of Amanda Palmer it can't do any harm and a great way to connect with new people. If you haven't seen her Ted Talk it is an inspired 10 minutes.
In the same vein, I would also be interested in doing some lunchtime readings followed by a Q & A period at your companies office about how creativity combined with technology can create positive changes in the workplace. Ideal for companies in the creative fields. Essential for companies that are not.


I have participated in a couple of crowd sourcing projects in the past and I really enjoyed following the process of the making of  the work as it gave me a greater appreciation and understanding of it when I received the final product upon completion. 
In conclusion. I hope that my story and this book serves a few purposes. First and foremost I hope it is an entertaining read at the very least and that it gives the reader a sense of what it was like to have worked as a photographer in the pre through to the  post digital era.

<p>In the National Street Art Gallery Project artists from different regions in Uganda work together with both national and international volunteers, including artists, art lovers and activists and communities to create artworks that advocate directly for cultural and social change - think of issues such as Aids/HIV, corruption, landgrabbing and discrimination of minorities. </p>
<p>The strength of the project lies within the fact that the art themes are inspired by the community for the community.

This approach will inspire understanding and mutual respect between the artist and the community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the National Street Gallery public launching event large walls will be constructed for mural painters, street artists and installation artists to create the art works. These artists will be invited from all over the world on an annual theme to paint and repaint art works together with Ugandan visual artists, art students and the audience.</p>The ongoing Open Call for artists to participate in the first NSG launching event has already reached 120 artists both locally and internationally.

Kampala is a wonderful green creative city, full of young talented artists, however there is a severe lack of urban art initiatives where young talent can showcase their work while at the same time art becomes freely accessible to the public. Public street art gives a voice to the voiceless and can create room for discussion in a country where many issues remain unresolved.

The second component is a Mobile Arts Project, where artists from different regions visit remote communities to develop art with the people to voice their needs and struggles, which can then form inspiration for next year's theme. 


The National Street Art Gallery Project 


In the National Street Art Gallery Project artists from different regions in Uganda work together with both national and international volunteers, including artists, art lovers and activists and communities to create artworks that advocate directly for cultural and social change - think of issues such as Aids/HIV, corruption, landgrabbing and discrimination of minorities.

Where the artist functions as a messenger of the issues, giving his (or her) visual interpretation of the issue theme chosen. This approach will inspire understanding and mutual respect between the artist and the community.

These artists will be invited from all over the world on an annual theme to paint and repaint art works together with Ugandan visual artists, art students and the audience.The ongoing Open Call for artists to participate in the first NSG launching event has already reached 120 artists both locally and internationally.

What We Need 

 
National Street Gallery is a non-profit  project, we are full-time artists without  any fixed monthly salary trying to create a legacy of the 1st Street Art Space in East Africa, but the question is: 
Are we able to provide the materials and host the artists who are creating works for betterment of the Ugandan Communities?

<p>Imagine walking into a gallery and being immersed in a soundscape 
that interweaves the voice of nature with traditional Hawaiian chant and
 song. Combined with storytelling, the voice leads you on a journey 
along the path of <em>Kuku</em>-'<em>ena</em>-i-ke-ahi-ho'omau-honua 
(Beating Hot in the Perpetual Earth Fire). Kuku`ena, goddess of lei 
makers, sister of Pele, and guide to those lost in the forest.</p>
<p>With this multimedia art exhibit, to be held at the Hawai`i Museum of 
Contemporary Art in Hilo, I hope to use my art to illuminate the story of Kuku`ena, the 
lei-making guide to the lost, and to fund the Hilo Lei Day Festival, a community event that celebrates the culture and heritage of the lei. My husband, Manu, and I have been the primary funders for this event for 10 years, and  request your help in continuing the festival.<br/></p>
<p>The show will incorporate permanent and ephemeral art, static and kinetic art, visual art and performing art. I work in steel and copper, and I work in fabric and paper. I paint, I weld, and I dance. but ultimately, I am a storyteller, and my storytelling informs all of my art.</p>
<p>In this show, ""Beating Hot,"" I seek to tell the story of Kuku`ena: Her voyage with Pele across the vast Pacific, her arrival in a new land, her gift of the plants and art of the lei.</p>
<p>I hope to bring the viewer with me on a journey through a landscape of cultural metaphor of the lei. I want to give our island residents and visitors a 
place to reconnect with the forest, with nature, with the cultural 
concepts derived from nature that make us, as Hawaiians, who we are.<br/><br/>The
 exhibit is being held in conjunction with the Hilo Lei Day Festival, 
which is being re-visioned to be the showcase for a sustainable 
environmentally responsible interwoven program of education in arts, the
 environment, social responsibility, and fiscal responsibility.<br/></p>
<p>Aloha! I am Leilehua Yuen, artist, author, and educator. Some 25 years ago, I coined the term ""edutainment"" for what I do. . . teach Hawaiian culture and environmental sustainability through traditional cultural arts, including hula and storytelling.</p>
<p>It sure sounds boring when written out for a grant, but in practice, the audience, my husband (who is my performance partner), and I go on a magical romp through geology, ecology, anthropology, ethnology, musicology, the occasional apology, and Hawaiian history and culture.</p>
<p>I've spent much of the last quarter century taking educational performing and visual arts programs ""on the road"" for a variety of clients. For seven years, my husband and I performed weekly at the historic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFfprocktYA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hilo Palace Theater</a>, sharing the culture and history of Hawai`i nei. And over the past 30 years, I've done the occasional art show. My husband, Manu Josiah, and I have worked with internationally renowned producer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatiana_Issa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tatiana Issa</a> and and photographer <a href=""http://www.paulalobo.com/#!/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paula Lobo</a> on <a href=""http://globotv.globo.com/multishow/mundo-em-movimento/t/veja-tambem/v/ep13-em-big-island-havai-paula-lobo-descobre-os-segredos-da-hula/2338195/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mundo Em Movimento - Dances of the World</a>. <br/></p>
<p>This May 2015, I want to bring it all together in a composition of sculpture, painting, dance, music, stasis, kinesis, all exploring Hawaiian cultural concepts of the geology and ecology of Hawai`i, and how they interact with Hawaiian cultural constructs, through the metaphor of the lei. <br/></p>
<br/><h3>Time and Place</h3>I hope to hold the show the at the <a href=""http://www.ehcc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hawai`i Museum of Contemporary Arts</a>, opening on Friday, May 1, with a preview the evening of April 30.

<h3>Dear Friends of the Arts, </h3>
<p>If you’ve visited the Petaluma Arts Center over the last several years, you’ve probably met our dedicated volunteer, Judy Oster, sitting at the front desk.  Judy has always been there for the Petaluma Arts Center, especially in supporting arts education programs for children who might not otherwise be able to afford art classes. <strong>Now, we want to be there for Judy.</strong></p>
<p>Judy Oster has been dealing with cancer. At her request we would like to establish the <strong>Judy Oster Scholarship Fund</strong>. It is important to Judy that all children have the opportunity to be exposed to the arts now and in the future.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Our goal is to raise $10,000</strong> for The Judy Oster  Scholarship Fund by <strong>October 4th, 2012.</strong> We know this is not very much time to complete such a lofty goal but time is of the essence.  $10,000 supports 66 children for one session of afterschool art classes or one week of summer art camp. </p>
<p>With Judy's Fund the Petaluma Arts Center will be able to establish a scholarship  program in conjuction with local service agencies and schools to provide classes, and transportation to children who might not otherwise have access to our afterschool, summer and weekend art programs.</p>
<p>Your tax deductible donation of any amount will help make Judy’s wishes come true. In the past Judy herself has donated several thousand dollars to this fund. With your help this year and in future years we will be able to continue to offer art education scholarships at the Arts Center. </p>
<p><strong><em>Our Mission:</em></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our mission is to promote awareness, appreciation and expression of the<br/>cultural arts for Petaluma and Southern Sonoma County.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Dear Friends of the Arts, 
If you’ve visited the Petaluma Arts Center over the last several years, you’ve probably met our dedicated volunteer, Judy Oster, sitting at the front desk.  Judy has always been there for the Petaluma Arts Center, especially in supporting arts education programs for children who might not otherwise be able to afford art classes. Now, we want to be there for Judy.
Judy Oster has been dealing with cancer. At her request we would like to establish the Judy Oster Scholarship Fund. It is important to Judy that all children have the opportunity to be exposed to the arts now and in the future.  


What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise $10,000 for The Judy Oster  Scholarship Fund by October 4th, 2012. We know this is not very much time to complete such a lofty goal but time is of the essence.  $10,000 supports 66 children for one session of afterschool art classes or one week of summer art camp. 
With Judy's Fund the Petaluma Arts Center will be able to establish a scholarship  program in conjuction with local service agencies and schools to provide classes, and transportation to children who might not otherwise have access to our afterschool, summer and weekend art programs.
Your tax deductible donation of any amount will help make Judy’s wishes come true. In the past Judy herself has donated several thousand dollars to this fund. With your help this year and in future years we will be able to continue to offer art education scholarships at the Arts Center. 
Our Mission:


Our mission is to promote awareness, appreciation and expression of thecultural arts for Petaluma and Southern Sonoma County.
How We Serve the Community:  
In the last twenty years the Petaluma community has grown culturally and economically to become a hub for southern Sonoma and northern Marin Counties.  Residents have long recognized the need for a community arts center.  Since opening its 4,500 sq. ft. facility in the fall of 2008, the Petaluma Arts Center has established itself as a venue where people of all ages and diversity meet and experience the arts through educational and cultural opportunities.
The Petaluma Arts Center offers:  Visual Art Exhibitions of high quality provide a platform for individual self expression and a public venue for the visual arts. The Education Program Children, teens and adults create works of art and   develop their artistic abilities, and where appropriate, to further their artistic careers. Artist and Art Resource Listing Service is provided on our website for artists and art patrons. Celebrations such as El Día de los Muertos help Petaluma build bridges among the many cultures in our community. Arts Advocacy by the Petaluma Arts Council since 1998 has resulted in the City of  Petaluma’s Art & Cultural Component of the Petaluma General Plan.  This Component established the Public Art Ordinance which places sculpture in public places and recognizes art and culture as necessities for quality of life,

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello!  My name is Beth and I am a graduate of the Pacific Northwest College of Art, Portland, OR, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Sculpture.  In the three years since graduating, I have been creating works of art through drawing and painting.  All the while, I have been craving sculpture.  Up until a few months ago I lived in apartments and houses where the only option for a creative outlet was two dimensional works.  I am currently renting a house with a shed that I want to turn into a sculpture studio.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My dream is to have a career sculpting wood.  Half of this would entail carving abstract figures from tree trunks and large branches.  The two images I chose for this campaign are examples and were part of my Thesis project for my degree.  The other half of my dream career would be creating furniture (chairs and benches to start) out of tree branches.  I would take the bark off and sand the branches smooth, then piece the furniture together and sand a comfortable seat into it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The $1600 I am asking for will go towards fixing up my shed and buying the power tools I need to start sculpting.</p>
<p>$168 - 12 sheets of 4'X8' plywood to board up the shed (it currently has exposed insulation and my landlord does not want to pay for it, but has said I can do whatever I want to it)</p>
<p>$30 - two overhead fluorescent lights</p>
<p>$10 - nails for the plywood</p>
<p>$40 - two gallons of white primer paint to seal the plywood and help the light reflect</p>
<p>$700 - 60 gallon/120v air compressor</p>
<p>$130 - angle grinder and wood carving wheel</p>
<p>$50 - pneumatic sander</p>
<p>$125 - extended die grinder</p>
<p>$60 - shop vac</p>
<p>$287 - indiegogo fees, possible underestimation of costs, odds and ends</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What do you get for supporting me, besides the good feeling of helping a sculptress with her dream?  Art!!  I will make a print of one of my drawings and send it to you.  The more you give the larger the print will be, up to a poster sized 2'X3' print.  Go to <a href=""http://www.zhibit.org/bethnix"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.zhibit.org/bethnix</a> and take your pick!  And, even better, if you give at the $500 level you will get a wood sculpture custom made just for you!</p>
<p>And if you can't help with any funding, share my cause!  Links to my Facebook page, website and First Thursday Art Sale (Portland, OR) are below.  The more people that know about this the better chance I will have of reaching my goal.  And if I don't reach my goal, I will at least be going in the right direction!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THANK YOU for anything and everything you can do to help me reach my goal and start my dream!  Love and light to you and yours,</p>

<h2>New Orleans needs public chess tables.</h2>

Encore un honneur pour moi car les nombre de place est limité et les possibilités qu’ouvre cette expérience supplémentaire sont immenses. Cette troisième année me permettrait de voir aboutir des travaux personnels commencés l'an passé. Je pourrais emprunter tout le matériel nécessaire à la réalisation des projets, accéder à des studios professionnels, au labo… J’aurais aussi la possibilité de tirer les images et je bénéficierais encore un peu plus du suivi et les conseils du photographe professionnel Pierre Barbot. Les étudiants qui feront partie du groupe pourront rencontrer différents intervenants de grande renommée, comme Jan-Evelyn Atwood, qui se déplaceront à l'école pour plusieurs jours et y présenteront leurs travaux et leurs démarches.


Que m'apportera de plus cette dernière année d'étude ?

Si j’ai la chance de pouvoir suivre cette année de formation complémentaire, je voudrais affirmer un peu plus encore ma personnalité dans la photographie et acquérir l’expérience qui est plus que nécessaire aujourd’hui pour acquérir une légitimité dans le milieu de la photo et pouvoir trouver un travail à la sortie de l’école.
La troisième année d’étude se clôt sur la remise des Grands Prix. Les images produites par les jeunes photographes sont alors envoyées à Paris et jugées par un jury de grands photographes. Plusieurs prix viennent encourager et récompenser les projets les plus prometteurs. Ces photos sont ensuite exposées à Toulouse à l’occasion d’une belle soirée de fin d’études. C’est l’occasion pour les étudiants de recevoir le diplôme de Licence en Photographie reconnu par l'État.
 

 
C’est pour pouvoir vivre tous ces moments que je m’adresse à vous. Je vous propose ainsi à la vente quelques unes de mes images sous forme de tirages papier, toiles ou encore shooting personalisé. Tous les tirages sont en édition limitées et seront numérotés de 1 à 10. Cette vente me permettrait ainsi de m'aider à financer cette troisième et dernière année d'étude. Vous seriez mes complices et je me ferais un plaisir de vous remercier avec ce que je sais faire de mieux : mes photos ! Vous pouvez en découvrir un aperçu dans la gallerie mais également sur mon site qui, je l’espère, se verra bientôt enrichi par mes nouveaux travaux.

<p><b>New Hermetics Tarot Deck</b></p>
<p>Although an author of more than 18 books, Jason Augustus Newcomb is best known for his 2004 landmark title, <b style=""font-style: italic;"">The New Hermetics</b>, in which he strips down the rituals of the old world and empowers each individual to create his or her own path. This tarot set is an outgrowth of both his book and the New Hermetics system. Each card is from an original painting, created during the writing &amp; publication of his book. This is the first time they will have been published as a deck. But, you need not be familiar with Jason's book, <b><i>The New Hermetics</i></b>, in order to benefit from this insightful and symbolic tarot set!</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/55017/files/20130905112854-photo-62a.JPG?1378405734"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Descriptions of the various items in the Perks are as
follows:</b></p>
<p><b>TRUMP CARD</b></p>
<p>We are offering 5 larger, 3.5"" x 5.5"" copies of each of the 22 Trumps from the <b>New Hermetics Tarot </b>set. Claiming these cards will happen on a first-come, first-serve
basis. Once all FIVE copies of a specific Trump card have been claimed, we will
no longer offer it, as long as the other Trumps are still available; however, if all 5 sets of trumps sell out quickly, we will print additional sets, 5 at a time, to accommodate those that may want a single card or who may have missed being able to claim a set. These larger cards, with a different back than the regular set, are intended to be a focal point on your altar or as a meditation aide. Perhaps you've always felt an unspoken connection with a specific tarot trump and consider it as a kind of personal totem. This would be for you.</p>
<p><b>BOOK</b></p>
<p>Jason has penned a new companion book on the Tarot, entitled <b><i>Examining the New Hermetics Tarot</i></b>, but more
specifically discussing this particular deck and why he made the decisions he
did when choosing what symbology to include on each card. This will be a
limited edition, smaller paperback book, signed by the author, with an
estimated pressrun of 250.</p>
<p><b>SMALL DECK</b></p>
<p>Only available through this campaign, we are offering a
limited pressrun of a smaller, travel-size version of the <b>New Hermetics Tarot</b>
deck. This smaller deck measures in at 2.25” x 3.5”. This is a 78 card deck and
though limited to an estimated 100 copies, it will not be numbered or signed.</p>
<p><b>REGULAR DECK</b></p>
<p>This is really what this campaign is about. We want to
create an unlimited edition of a regular, 2.75” x 4.75” <b>New Hermetics Tarot
</b>deck, to be commercially available. We are starting off by offering a signed
&amp; numbered, first pressrun of that deck. This will be an 80 card deck (<i>one
of those extra cards will be numbered &amp; signed</i>). After the approx. 200
signed &amp; numbered copies are gone, this deck will remain commercially
available (<i>with a different design on the rear</i>) but not signed &amp;
numbered.</p>
<p></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p><b>TATTWA CARDS</b></p>
<p></p>A set of 25 meditative, color-scale cards, divided among the 5 elements, Tattwa Cards were traditionally employed by the <i>Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</i> to aid students in astral clairvoyance. An affordable commercial set of these cards have not been available on the market for many years, with used copies of John Mumford’s set selling for well over $100 on places like Amazon or eBay. Our complimentary set of these cards, included as a “Thank You” for your level of support at $100 or more, measures 3.5” x 3.5” square and will surely find a welcome and familiar home in your temple!<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/54742/files/20130905091023-IMG_2996.jpg?1378397423"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Descriptions of the various Perks are as follows:</b><br/></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">
</span></p>
<p><b>01) Pick a Card, Any Card    $10</b></p>
<p>Your support at this level, gets you the choice of ONE of
the 22 Trump designs from the <b>New Hermetics Tarot</b>, printed as a beautiful
3.5"" x 5.5"" card, with a different back than the standard deck, suitable for meditation or display on your altar. We are
starting with only 5 copies of each card available, so it's first-come,
first-serve to reserve a Trump. For example, if you’re interested in the <i>LOVERS</i>
card but 5 other people have already chosen that card (<i>either in this or other perks</i>), you'll have to pick a different Trump,
instead. So act fast to get your favorite!</p>
<p><b>02) Double Down  $15</b></p>
<p>Your support at this level, gets you the choice of TWO of
the 22 Trump designs from the <b>New Hermetics Tarot</b>, printed as a beautiful
3.5"" x 5.5"" card, with a different back than the standard deck, suitable for framing or display on your altar. We are starting with only 5 copies
of each card available, so it's first-come, first-serve to reserve a Trump. For
example, if you’re interested in the <i>TOWER</i> card but 5 other people have already
chosen that card (<i>either in this or other
perks</i>), you'll have to pick a different Trump, instead. So act fast to get
your favorite!</p>
<p><b>03) Book Smart  $20</b></p>
<p>With this perk you’ll receive a signed copy of a newly
penned book from author Jason Augustus Newcomb, <b><i>Examining the New Hermetics Tarot</i></b>,
describing specifically the symbology and intent behind his own personal Tarot
deck. This book will receive a limited pressrun of approximately 250 copies,
and this may be your only chance to purchase a one.</p>
<p><b>04) Small Deck  $25</b></p>
<p>This perk gives the supporter a smaller version of our main
project. You’ll receive a full 78 card <b>New Hermetics Tarot</b> deck in the smaller,
travel size of 2.25” x 3.5”. This smaller deck will only be available through
this campaign, with approx. 100 unsigned, unnumbered decks currently being
planned.</p>

smaller decks, along with ONE of the 3.5” x 5.5” Trumps of their choice.</p>

level will reward you with a copy of the 80 card, signed &amp; numbered,
regular sized (2.75” x 4.75”) edition of the <b>New Hermetics Tarot</b>. By supporting
at this level, not only will you be receiving this Tarot deck for less than
retail but you won’t need to worry about those pesky s&amp;h charges that you’d
likely be stuck paying if you wait a few months to buy it. Although this deck
will be available after the campaign, this will be your only opportunity to
purchase one of the limited, numbered &amp; signed sets. The exact number of
these will be determined by the demand; however, we are anticipating printing
approx. 200 of these signed &amp; numbered sets.</p>
<p><b>07) Small Deck &amp; Book  $40</b></p>
<p>This perk offers a copy of the smaller, travel-size <b>New
Hermetics Tarot</b> deck along with a copy of the book. Remember, the smaller deck

<p><b>STRETCH GOALS</b></p>
<p><b>$1,500</b></p>
<p>If we reach our initial goal of $1,500 with this campaign,
every supporter who donated <i>$25 or more</i> will receive a PDF of additional,
unpublished, advanced instructions for the <b>New Hermetics Tarot</b>, as well as your choice of
one of several audio recordings. The menu for you to choose from will include
a number of never-before released audio recordings from Jason, as well as some

recordings (for sale at Jason Augustus Newcomb dot com) or his free, weekly webinars,
this is a great opportunity to hear some rare, unreleased material from him.</p>
<p><b>$2,000</b></p>
<p>If we exceed our goal and hit the $2,000 mark, everyone who
contributed <i>$50 or more</i> will receive a specially printed set of the 22 trump
cards, which were showcased in his book <b><i>Sexual Sorcery</i></b>. This book from 2005,
still available from <i>Red Wheel/Weiser</i>,
featured these 22 cards in black-and-white. You will receive a set of the 22
Major Arcana in full color, the same size as the New Hermetics Tarot,
at 2.75” x 4.75”, perfect for use with meditations from the book and the
awakening of your kundalini. Additionally, you’ll still receive the rewards
from the $1,500 stretch goal.</p>

<p><b>$2,500</b></p>
<p>If we are able to exceed our initial goal by one thousand
dollars and hit the $2,500 mark, each supporter who donated <i>$75 or more</i> to help
us get there, will receive a set of 22 Hebrew letter, flashing-color meditation
cards, designed by Jason. These meditative cards are the perfect tool for those
individuals who explore the tarot on a deeper level through meditative
pathworkings, as each of the 22 Hebrew letters directly corresponds with one of
the 22 tarot trumps. Additionally, you’ll still receive the rewards from the
$1,500 and $2,000 stretch goals.</p>

<p>For each additional landmark of $500 beyond the $3,000 mark, we will continue to offer further ""thank you"" gifts to those who have contributed <i>$100 or more</i> to the campaign.

Although an author of more than 18 books, Jason Augustus Newcomb is best known for his 2004 landmark title, The New Hermetics, in which he strips down the rituals of the old world and empowers each individual to create his or her own path. This tarot set is an outgrowth of both his book and the New Hermetics system. Each card is from an original painting, created during the writing & publication of his book. This is the first time they will have been published as a deck. But, you need not be familiar with Jason's book, The New Hermetics, in order to benefit from this insightful and symbolic tarot set!



Descriptions of the various items in the Perks are as
follows:
TRUMP CARD
We are offering 5 larger, 3.5"" x 5.5"" copies of each of the 22 Trumps from the New Hermetics Tarot set. Claiming these cards will happen on a first-come, first-serve
basis. Once all FIVE copies of a specific Trump card have been claimed, we will
no longer offer it, as long as the other Trumps are still available; however, if all 5 sets of trumps sell out quickly, we will print additional sets, 5 at a time, to accommodate those that may want a single card or who may have missed being able to claim a set. These larger cards, with a different back than the regular set, are intended to be a focal point on your altar or as a meditation aide. Perhaps you've always felt an unspoken connection with a specific tarot trump and consider it as a kind of personal totem. This would be for you.
BOOK
Jason has penned a new companion book on the Tarot, entitled Examining the New Hermetics Tarot, but more
specifically discussing this particular deck and why he made the decisions he
did when choosing what symbology to include on each card. This will be a
limited edition, smaller paperback book, signed by the author, with an
estimated pressrun of 250.
SMALL DECK
Only available through this campaign, we are offering a
limited pressrun of a smaller, travel-size version of the New Hermetics Tarot
deck. This smaller deck measures in at 2.25” x 3.5”. This is a 78 card deck and
though limited to an estimated 100 copies, it will not be numbered or signed.
REGULAR DECK
This is really what this campaign is about. We want to
create an unlimited edition of a regular, 2.75” x 4.75” New Hermetics Tarot
deck, to be commercially available. We are starting off by offering a signed
& numbered, first pressrun of that deck. This will be an 80 card deck (one
of those extra cards will be numbered & signed). After the approx. 200
signed & numbered copies are gone, this deck will remain commercially
available (with a different design on the rear) but not signed &
numbered.



TATTWA CARDS
A set of 25 meditative, color-scale cards, divided among the 5 elements, Tattwa Cards were traditionally employed by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn to aid students in astral clairvoyance. An affordable commercial set of these cards have not been available on the market for many years, with used copies of John Mumford’s set selling for well over $100 on places like Amazon or eBay. Our complimentary set of these cards, included as a “Thank You” for your level of support at $100 or more, measures 3.5” x 3.5” square and will surely find a welcome and familiar home in your temple!



Descriptions of the various Perks are as follows:


01) Pick a Card, Any Card    $10
Your support at this level, gets you the choice of ONE of
the 22 Trump designs from the New Hermetics Tarot, printed as a beautiful
3.5"" x 5.5"" card, with a different back than the standard deck, suitable for meditation or display on your altar. We are
starting with only 5 copies of each card available, so it's first-come,
first-serve to reserve a Trump. For example, if you’re interested in the LOVERS
card but 5 other people have already chosen that card (either in this or other perks), you'll have to pick a different Trump,
instead. So act fast to get your favorite!
02) Double Down  $15
Your support at this level, gets you the choice of TWO of
the 22 Trump designs from the New Hermetics Tarot, printed as a beautiful
3.5"" x 5.5"" card, with a different back than the standard deck, suitable for framing or display on your altar. We are starting with only 5 copies
of each card available, so it's first-come, first-serve to reserve a Trump. For
example, if you’re interested in the TOWER card but 5 other people have already
chosen that card (either in this or other
perks), you'll have to pick a different Trump, instead. So act fast to get
your favorite!
03) Book Smart  $20
With this perk you’ll receive a signed copy of a newly
penned book from author Jason Augustus Newcomb, Examining the New Hermetics Tarot,
describing specifically the symbology and intent behind his own personal Tarot
deck. This book will receive a limited pressrun of approximately 250 copies,
and this may be your only chance to purchase a one.
04) Small Deck  $25
This perk gives the supporter a smaller version of our main
project. You’ll receive a full 78 card New Hermetics Tarot deck in the smaller,
travel size of 2.25” x 3.5”. This smaller deck will only be available through
this campaign, with approx. 100 unsigned, unnumbered decks currently being
planned.
05) Small Deck & Card    $30
This perks offers the supporter one of our limited-edition
smaller decks, along with ONE of the 3.5” x 5.5” Trumps of their choice.
06) Large New Hermetics Tarot Deck  $35
This is why we are all here. Supporting this project at this
level will reward you with a copy of the 80 card, signed & numbered,
regular sized (2.75” x 4.75”) edition of the New Hermetics Tarot. By supporting
at this level, not only will you be receiving this Tarot deck for less than
retail but you won’t need to worry about those pesky s&h charges that you’d
likely be stuck paying if you wait a few months to buy it. Although this deck
will be available after the campaign, this will be your only opportunity to
purchase one of the limited, numbered & signed sets. The exact number of
these will be determined by the demand; however, we are anticipating printing
approx. 200 of these signed & numbered sets.
07) Small Deck & Book  $40

Hermetics Tarot deck along with a copy of the book. Remember, the smaller deck

Hermetics Tarot deck along with a copy of the book and your choice of ONE of
the 3.5” x 5.5” Trump cards. Remember, the smaller deck is NOT numbered and signed.

Would you prefer to pick up TWO copies of the smaller,
travel-size New Hermetics Tarot deck for you and a friend? This perk is perfect
for you!
10) Large Deck & Book  $50
With this perk, you’ll receive a copy of the regular-sized,
signed & numbered New Hermetics Tarot along with Jason’s new book, Examining
the New Hermetics Tarot.
11) One & Another    $55
Can’t decide on the small or large Tarot deck? This perk
gets you one copy each of the smaller, travel-sized AND larger, regular-sized
New Hermetics Tarot deck. That’s 2 decks at a greatly reduced price! Remember,
only the larger deck is signed & numbered.
12) Large & Small & one Card  $60

travel-sized AND larger, regular-sized New Hermetics Tarot deck, as well as
your choice of ONE of the 3.5” x 5.5” Trump cards. Remember, only the larger deck
is signed & numbered.
13) Two of a Kind    $65
This perk gets you TWO copies of the regular-sized, signed
& numbered New Hermetics Tarot decks. This is a perfect way to give a gift,
without feeling like you want to keep it for yourself at the last minute.
14) Two Large & one Card  $70
This perk gets you TWO copies of the regular-sized, signed
& numbered New Hermetics Tarot decks, as well as your choice of ONE of the
3.5” x 5.5” Trump cards.

17) Deluxe Set  $100
At this level, we are introducing a new item, a set of 25
traditional Tattwa cards, in addition to one copy of each of the 2 different
sized decks and a copy of the book.  Tattwa Cards were traditionally employed by
the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn to aid students in astral clairvoyance.
An affordable commercial set of these cards have not been available for many
years, with used copies of John Mumford’s set selling for well over $100 used
on places like Amazon. Our complimentary set of these cards, included as a
“Thank You” for your level of support, measures 3.5” x 3.5” square. So, to

and 1 set of 25 Tattwa Cards.

set, ask for advice on how to work with the cards, request a tarot reading from
him or just about any way in which you wish to spend your 30 minutes.
All prices include FREE s&h charges within the United States. Any international orders will be asked to pay only actual postage, which has yet to be determined.

do. I am gathering funding to have my Krampus design printed as 
postcards (and folding cards too, if funding reaches $100 or more) to send to people for the holidays. ""Gruss vom Krampus"" means 
""greetings from the Kampus."" Though its roots lie in pre-Christian 
Germanic traditions, the Krampus eventually became a part of Christian winter 
celebrations. No free handouts of coal here; the Krampus 
catches bad little children and takes them away to be eaten. Great

If $400 is reached, a secondary mystery postcard/folding card design will be announced and included in the perks. If the project reaches $500, three mystery postcard/folding card designs will be announced and included in the perks. <br/></p><p><b>Funding goes towards:</b> <br/></p><ul>

Contributors are free to contact me and arrange to have the original version (or a high-quality print) of the bust commissions mailed, if they so desire. An extra charge for printing and shipping will apply. Commissions may take longer to be completed and sent than other perks. NOTE TO CONTRIBUTORS OUTSIDE THE U.S.: Contributors from outside of the U.S. who are contributing $10 or more, and receiving perks through the mail, need to add $15 to their contribution for shipping. Contributors from outside the U.S. opting for commissions as perks do not need to add $15, and they will receive their commissions as high-resolution files.The ImpactYou will be helping me to fund my very first solo project as an artist, 
as well as encouraging and supporting future artistic endeavours from 
me! Every little bit helps. All profits go towards funding this project 
and future--perhaps even bigger--creative projects of mine! I can't do this on my own, but with your help I can. Your investment in my artistic endeavours is very much appreciated.Other Ways You Can HelpGetting the word out about my project helps a lot! Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter-- just talk about my project where ever you like to spend time on the internet! Telling friends and family is great too. Tell anyone and everyone you know! UPDATE!FULLY FUNDED! A huge thank you to everyone of you. You are the reason for the success of this project. I am utterly amazed and honored by the amount of support I have received for my project. Thank you, and thank you again. I apologize for the lateness of my update.
SO! What Happens Now?Because the project is fully funded, I will be able to print the three mystery postcard designs I mentioned. - Those of you who donated $10 or more will receive a set of the mystery postcards in addition to your original perks. - Those of you who donated $30 or more will receive three sets of the mystery postcards in addition to your original perks. - Those of you who donated $50 or more will receive five sets of the mystery postcards and five folding cards in addition to your original perks. -Those of you who donated $90 or more I will be contacting individually about your perks.
This Week (Dec. 1 - 7)- I will be mailing out the thank you postcards, and the postcards of those who opted for extra Krampus cards as part of their perks. -I will be ordering the mystery design postcards.-I will begin work on sketch commissions, and mail them out as I finish them.After This Week- I will be continuing to work on sketch commissions and commissions. - As soon as the mystery postcards com in, I will mail them out.  Is There Anything Else You Need to Do?Those of you who opted for commissions from me need to let me know what you would like for your commission. The sooner you let me know, the sooner I can start!Please feel free to contact me know if you have questions, comments, or concerns!The Three Mystery Designs Are:http://aramis-september.tumblr.com/post/6912074...Thanks again everyone!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p></p><h3></h3>
<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>So for those of you that don’t know me my name is Todd Anderson-Kunert. I’m an artist
that works between installation, performance, releases (like the one your about
to read about), and generally mixes of those three things. </p>
<p>I have a solo show coming up at Strange Neighbour
Gallery in Fitzroy (run by some really great people, check them out at <a href=""http://www.strangeneighbour.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>www.strangeneighbour.com</span></span></a>). The show opens Friday 21<sup>st</sup> February, and is an audiovisual installation consisting
of nineteen photographic images, and an eight channel sound installation. </p>
<p>As a part of the exhibition, I’ve produced a 7” vinyl
and black and white artist book. The vinyl contains the audio from the
installation, and the book contains all of the images. All are hand numbered
and signed. </p>
<p>The total cost of manufacturing the 7” Vinyl and book
alone is AU$1650.00. At an edition of 100, this means that the cost of each one
is $16.50. The normal sale price of 7” in my experience is between $10-$15.</p>
<p>I don’t make art for financial reasons, I make art
because it makes sense to. At the moment, I’m aiming on getting my practice
more sustainable. This doesn’t necessarily mean getting others to pay for my
practice for me (I’ve already had these made!), but it does mean looking at other
ways I can fund my projects. So…</p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>There are two ways you can financially support this
project:</p>
<p>1) Pre-order a copy of the 7” vinyl and artist book
for the price of AU$15 (cheaper than making them yourself!). Your copy will be
waiting for you to pick it up at the exhibition opening (Postage is available
at an extra cost).</p>
<p>2) Or for AU$125 you can purchase the 7” vinyl and
book also, but it will include a limited edition 7” chromogenic print of one of
the images from the exhibition. This offer is limited to the first 19
supporters as there are only 19 images in the show. You will also get one of
the first 19 editions of the vinyl/book. While this is a large amount of money,
it’s actually about 80% less than I usually sell chromogenic prints for. </p>
<p>NOTE: Some of the images from the show are
rectangular, which means that they can’t be printed as a 7” square print. In
this case, the images will be 5.6 x 7”, and there will be a white strip of
paper at two of the edges (it will still be printed on a 7” square of
photographic paper).</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>If I sell all 19 of the second option I'll raise AU$2000, that will pay
for all of the production costs of the artist book, vinyl, and the limited
edition prints. This would be a huge help. If these don’t sell during this campaign
they won’t be available at a later date, so this is the only place to get one! </p>
<p>If I sell the remaining 71 vinyl/books, I’ll get a
total of AU$1065. This will be used to other cover costs associated with the
exhibition. This won’t by any means pay for the exhibition, but it will make my
practice ‘more’ sustainable! Any that don’t sell during this campaign will be
available for purchase on at the exhibition.</p>
<p>And also, pre-ordering gets you out of being ‘that
person’ that says ‘I’d totally buy one’ and then not buying one…. which makes
the world a better place. </p>
<p>NOTE: There are 10 editions here that are not
mentioned. This is because they are being used for promotion and will be sent
interstate and overseas.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>So, if you can’t help financially, that’s totally
fine. But if you can spread the word to those that might be able to, that would
be a big help. </p>
<p>You can also just turn up to the exhibition! And

<p></p></div>","Short Summary
So for those of you that don’t know me my name is Todd Anderson-Kunert. I’m an artist
that works between installation, performance, releases (like the one your about
to read about), and generally mixes of those three things. 
I have a solo show coming up at Strange Neighbour
Gallery in Fitzroy (run by some really great people, check them out at www.strangeneighbour.com). The show opens Friday 21st February, and is an audiovisual installation consisting
of nineteen photographic images, and an eight channel sound installation. 
As a part of the exhibition, I’ve produced a 7” vinyl
and black and white artist book. The vinyl contains the audio from the
installation, and the book contains all of the images. All are hand numbered
and signed. 
The total cost of manufacturing the 7” Vinyl and book
alone is AU$1650.00. At an edition of 100, this means that the cost of each one
is $16.50. The normal sale price of 7” in my experience is between $10-$15.
I don’t make art for financial reasons, I make art
because it makes sense to. At the moment, I’m aiming on getting my practice
more sustainable. This doesn’t necessarily mean getting others to pay for my
practice for me (I’ve already had these made!), but it does mean looking at other
ways I can fund my projects. So…
What I Need & What You Get
There are two ways you can financially support this
project:
1) Pre-order a copy of the 7” vinyl and artist book
for the price of AU$15 (cheaper than making them yourself!). Your copy will be
waiting for you to pick it up at the exhibition opening (Postage is available
at an extra cost).
2) Or for AU$125 you can purchase the 7” vinyl and
book also, but it will include a limited edition 7” chromogenic print of one of
the images from the exhibition. This offer is limited to the first 19
supporters as there are only 19 images in the show. You will also get one of
the first 19 editions of the vinyl/book. While this is a large amount of money,
it’s actually about 80% less than I usually sell chromogenic prints for. 
NOTE: Some of the images from the show are
rectangular, which means that they can’t be printed as a 7” square print. In
this case, the images will be 5.6 x 7”, and there will be a white strip of
paper at two of the edges (it will still be printed on a 7” square of
photographic paper).
The Impact
If I sell all 19 of the second option I'll raise AU$2000, that will pay
for all of the production costs of the artist book, vinyl, and the limited
edition prints. This would be a huge help. If these don’t sell during this campaign
they won’t be available at a later date, so this is the only place to get one! 
If I sell the remaining 71 vinyl/books, I’ll get a
total of AU$1065. This will be used to other cover costs associated with the
exhibition. This won’t by any means pay for the exhibition, but it will make my
practice ‘more’ sustainable! Any that don’t sell during this campaign will be
available for purchase on at the exhibition.
And also, pre-ordering gets you out of being ‘that
person’ that says ‘I’d totally buy one’ and then not buying one…. which makes
the world a better place. 
NOTE: There are 10 editions here that are not
mentioned. This is because they are being used for promotion and will be sent
interstate and overseas.
Other Ways You Can Help
So, if you can’t help financially, that’s totally
fine. But if you can spread the word to those that might be able to, that would
be a big help. 
You can also just turn up to the exhibition! And
invite some friends along too! Opening night in on Friday 21st
February from 6-9pm, and the exhibition runs until the 22nd March
2014. And if you enjoy it, drop me a line. That also helps too.

<h3>Project Summary</h3>

<div>
<p>I will head west from Chicago, following the <a href=""http://www.discoverytrail.org/news/parker/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">American Discovery Trail</a>, the nation's only coast-to-coast, non-motorized trail, spending the night in campgrounds, farms and in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>My journey will be about facing fears and fantasies.</p>
<p>I have always had a special fascination with horses. And I used to ride regularly when I was younger. I tend to forget the bad experiences: horses walking on my feet, biting me, getting scared and galloping off, (almost) crushing my chest with their hooves.</p>
<p><strong>My most persistent romantic dream is, to this day, to travel by horse through majestic landscapes and undergo some sort of heroic transformation</strong>. I haven’t been a teenager for thirteen years now. <strong>It is time to explore what was real about this desire, and face the reality of physical exhaustion, loneliness, fear</strong>. I will document my metamorphosis from irritable city dweller to whatever I will become after this epic feat. Failure is a possible outcome. Solitude will make me write.</p>
<p><strong>I will carry with me a DSLR camera (capable of shooting HD video), a digital sound recorder (with binaural microphones), a film camera, pen and paper</strong>. This equipment is already in my possession. I’m considering bringing an iPad and regularly updating a blog.</p>
<p><strong>I want to deconstruct my own myths but also interrogate the American myth of the Great Outdoors</strong>.</p>
<p>My journey will also echo the spiritual journeys undertaken by shamans in oral societies in order to reconnect with the non-human world and enrich human discourse with the stories embedded in the land and its animal inhabitants.</p>
<p>When I get back to Chicago I will turn my material into a documentary, several artist's books, a series of prints, an installation, maybe a performance.</p>
<p>I can’t make any of this happen without you. This is your chance to be involved in the development of my new line of inquiry, which will likely culminate in my MFA thesis project.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Elijah Kihlstadius. I'm 19 years old, and I want to make a difference in this world. My story starts many years back, really. Growing up, is was in a very emotionally and verbally abusive environment. I was always the odd kid out, the odd ball, and the misfit. Unfortunately that environment changed me for the worse, as I grew up hating myself and hating everyone around me as well.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As I grew into my teen years, simple self hate and low self esteem stemmed into real serious problems. At first, it was simple self neglect and social avoidance. Then growing into my later teen years, I began to develop an poor eating habits, depression, and extreme avoidance of everyone around me.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">In May
of this year I was diagnosed with extreme depression. I was told that
I should not be able to function. I was told that people in my mental
state should not be able to work or go to school. I was told that
people, like me, should be immediately admitted into a hospital for
intensive treatment and therapy. And yet, here I am. Still trying to
achieve my goals and show the world that God is not limited by my
weaknesses. </span>
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">“But he said to me, 'My grace is
sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.'
Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so
that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I
delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in
difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.” - 2
Corinthians 12:9-10</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">In addition to being diagnosed with
depression, I have also been fighting an eating disorder. Technically
classified as E.D.N.O.S. (Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified),
my disorder has caused me to maintain an unhealthy weight, and made
it difficult for me to have a healthy immune system due to the lack
of nutrients going into my body.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is me. I am learning to accept the things I cannot change, and I am fighting to change the things that I can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""><h3 style="""">The Opportunity</h3>
<div>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">I've been accepted to the <b>Creative
DTS (Discipleship Training School) </b>at the Youth With A Mission
base in Wiler, Switzerland. Additionally, they have asked <i>me</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">
to teach the photography portion of the training there at the base. I
could go into further details, but I want to refrain from possibly
boring you with mundane things that aren't particularly pertinent to
this letter.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">I
would be leaving mid September 2011 and returning early June 2012. My
time there would be split up between a seven month training and
lecture phase and two months of hard core global outreach, with four
weeks of skill specific training, in my case photography,
interspersed amongst the seven month lecture phase.</span></p>
</div></span></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe that before I can make a difference in other people lives, I need to first change myself. This opportunity to go to Switzerland will give me the chance to not only build a solid foundation for myself and my future, but more importantly this will give me the chance to heal. Away from the pain and darkness, I can begin to heal and put my life back together from the inside out.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The
lecture phase will cost 6600 CHF, which is approximately $7879 (it
varies depending on the given exchange rate at the time). The
outreach phase will cost 4500 CHF, which is approximately $5372.
There are also some additional expenses such as the flight and some
various supplies, which are detailed in a spreadsheet at the bottom
of this page.</span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">You can share this page on your Facebook, Twitter, or other social media profile! Check out the sharing tools and spread the word! </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Also, please
pray and ask God if He would have you support me in my efforts in
going to Switzerland. If you can help in any way, whether it be
through funds, providing a needed item (see list) or simply praying
for me, it would be greatly appreciated :) Also, above all else,
please pray that no matter what happens with this opportunity that
God's will would done and He would be glorified in all that I
accomplish.<br/></p>

</div></div>","My Story
My name is Elijah Kihlstadius. I'm 19 years old, and I want to make a difference in this world. My story starts many years back, really. Growing up, is was in a very emotionally and verbally abusive environment. I was always the odd kid out, the odd ball, and the misfit. Unfortunately that environment changed me for the worse, as I grew up hating myself and hating everyone around me as well.

As I grew into my teen years, simple self hate and low self esteem stemmed into real serious problems. At first, it was simple self neglect and social avoidance. Then growing into my later teen years, I began to develop an poor eating habits, depression, and extreme avoidance of everyone around me.


In May
of this year I was diagnosed with extreme depression. I was told that
I should not be able to function. I was told that people in my mental
state should not be able to work or go to school. I was told that
people, like me, should be immediately admitted into a hospital for
intensive treatment and therapy. And yet, here I am. Still trying to
achieve my goals and show the world that God is not limited by my
weaknesses. 


“But he said to me, 'My grace is
sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.'
Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so
that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I
delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in
difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.” - 2
Corinthians 12:9-10

In addition to being diagnosed with
depression, I have also been fighting an eating disorder. Technically
classified as E.D.N.O.S. (Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified),
my disorder has caused me to maintain an unhealthy weight, and made
it difficult for me to have a healthy immune system due to the lack
of nutrients going into my body.


This is me. I am learning to accept the things I cannot change, and I am fighting to change the things that I can.

The Opportunity

I've been accepted to the Creative
DTS (Discipleship Training School) at the Youth With A Mission
base in Wiler, Switzerland. Additionally, they have asked me
to teach the photography portion of the training there at the base. I
could go into further details, but I want to refrain from possibly
boring you with mundane things that aren't particularly pertinent to
this letter.

I
would be leaving mid September 2011 and returning early June 2012. My
time there would be split up between a seven month training and
lecture phase and two months of hard core global outreach, with four
weeks of skill specific training, in my case photography,
interspersed amongst the seven month lecture phase.

The Impact
I believe that before I can make a difference in other people lives, I need to first change myself. This opportunity to go to Switzerland will give me the chance to not only build a solid foundation for myself and my future, but more importantly this will give me the chance to heal. Away from the pain and darkness, I can begin to heal and put my life back together from the inside out.


What I Need

The
lecture phase will cost 6600 CHF, which is approximately $7879 (it
varies depending on the given exchange rate at the time). The
outreach phase will cost 4500 CHF, which is approximately $5372.
There are also some additional expenses such as the flight and some
various supplies, which are detailed in a spreadsheet at the bottom
of this page.



Other Ways You Can Help

You can share this page on your Facebook, Twitter, or other social media profile! Check out the sharing tools and spread the word! 

Also, please
pray and ask God if He would have you support me in my efforts in
going to Switzerland. If you can help in any way, whether it be
through funds, providing a needed item (see list) or simply praying
for me, it would be greatly appreciated :) Also, above all else,
please pray that no matter what happens with this opportunity that
God's will would done and He would be glorified in all that I
accomplish.

                Marines At Work
 
September, 2011 is the
the ten-year anniversary of the United States’ war on terror.  To capture the quiet, real courage and
unique strength of the men and women currently in the United States Armed
Services I will live and travel with a unit of US Marines on deployment in
Afghanistan to do portrait sittings of the Marines.

In over twenty years of
photography I have specialized in capturing individuals at work—from athletes

<h3>Feel The Spark.</h3>
<p><strong>An epidemic is sweeping our nation.</strong> We are discontent. Workaholics. Stressed.</p>
<p>Often what we need is engagement in a process that allows us to have a voice. We need places to make things without judgement. We need supportive communities of other creative people. <strong>We need space to make art and a creative community to join.</strong> </p>
<p>Painting saved me. My creative community never ceases to inspire me. <strong>Everyone deserves that. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We are about hosting 50 physical events that invite average adults to come find the creative outlet they have been searching for.</strong> There are opportunities waiting. The event may only last 2 hours, but attendees will walk away with resources to keep them going.</p>

An epidemic is sweeping our nation. We are discontent. Workaholics. Stressed.
Often what we need is engagement in a process that allows us to have a voice. We need places to make things without judgement. We need supportive communities of other creative people. We need space to make art and a creative community to join. 
Painting saved me. My creative community never ceases to inspire me. Everyone deserves that. 
We are about hosting 50 physical events that invite average adults to come find the creative outlet they have been searching for. There are opportunities waiting. The event may only last 2 hours, but attendees will walk away with resources to keep them going.


An Epic Creative Road Trip.
I leave June 16 for a 10,000+ mile road trip around the USA and Canada. The intinerary is just about complete and I am in the throws of planning each event. 
Each event will include:

An opportunity to make something. Choose between: a mixed media booklet, creative writing, or mail art. 
A raffle for creative books or products.
A chance to meet local artists/teachers.
Local creative resources.
Info on creative classes available through seekyourcourse.com

The execution leverages Joshua’s experience creating his own tops on his Mazak machining center.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501220527/xlqjpx6rzxjmrlm0swur.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Our combination of fundamentally sound design and meticulous execution creates a spinning top that delivers on the design objectives.

I have an introduction about myself at the bottom of the campaign story, but I think the one important thing I’d like you to know about me is that trust and reliability are two of my most closely held values. If you like what you see, back this campaign with the confidence of knowing we have the experience, tooling and materials on hand to deliver the perks on time. Ho’onalu - go with the flow. The Hawaiian language is very poetic and the name of this top embodies the meditative feeling I experience while spinning this top.  For this collaboration our objective was to create a pocketable, long spinning top with clean lines and my unique “look”.  The design leverages over three years of experience making custom tops, one at a time on my Logan 1917 manual lathe. The execution leverages Joshua’s experience creating his own tops on his Mazak machining center.  Our combination of fundamentally sound design and meticulous execution creates a spinning top that delivers on the design objectives. The stem is machined with my signature look, the Simonich-style GunnerGrip, which provides visual appeal both static and spinning but most importantly facilitates traction between your fingers and the top for a great launch.With it’s low design it is definitely not a “beginners” top, but with practice, backers should be able to hit spin time exceeding 10 minutes when spun on a smooth glass lens. If you are new to precision spinning tops, check out this link on spin technique: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8GdFXx25Qw To create a long spinning top you want the most dense (heaviest) material possible on the outer weight ring and the least dense (lightest) material at the core. Those to elements along with good design, sets the center of gravity low and the rotational inertia high.MT185 tungsten was chosen for it’s high density - at 97% tungsten it comes in over 8% higher density than the 90% pure alloys (https://www.tungsten.com/products/tungsten-alloy/).  While physics indicates that a less dense core material, like aluminum paired with a highly dense material like tungsten, would yield the longest spin times, through prototyping and testing we found copper, brass and stainless steel cores produced a more stable top with minimal sacrifice to spin time. Ho’onalu SpecsBody: MT185 alloy Tungsten, .740” diameterMachine finished or Flame blackenedCore Options: Copper, Brass, Stainless Steel, 0.185” diameter at stem w/ GunnerGrip textureBearing: .125” ceramic ballOverall Height: .85”Mass:

  Joshua Dawson and I have both been making custom spinning tops since 2014.  This is our first collaboration piece.  I utilized my experience making tungsten mini tops to design Ho’onalu in Autocad Fusion.  Joshua then took my design, translated it into Mazatrol and is crafting them on his Mazak CNC Lathe. The first prototypes were made with brass bodies and brass cores in June, 2017.  We started with brass so Joshua could program and test his machine and we could ensure the design produced a smooth spinner.  I have spun my brass prototype over 8 minutes, Joshua was breaking 10 minutes with his.The second wave of prototypes was made in MT185 Tungsten and both Brass and Copper to validate that we could indeed make a 10+ minute, ¾” pocket top.  I was getting anywhere from over 10 minutes to 14 minutes with these tungsten protos.  They are currently in the hands of a few collectors who I hope will leave comments with their impressions.   Once we finalized the design, Joshua created pre-production units, which I’ve personally tested and used for the photography in this campaign.Machining will start on these while the campaign is running in order to help get these delivered as quickly as possible.  Joshua ordered enough tungsten to make the first 100 tops - which we’ll be able to deliver in October, if not sooner.  If we surpass backing to produce more than 100 tops I will add additional Perks for a second batch that will come 30-60 days after the first batch.  The timing of the second batch is driven by lead time on the specific grade of tungsten we’ve chosen.When Joshua finishes machining the tops, they will come to me in Oregon, to get a satin finished tip like on my customs, as well as final inspection and shipping.  We would really appreciate your support in backing my first Indiegogo campaign.  Just hover over the option in the right hand column and click “Get This Perk”.Please share this campaign with anyone who would appreciate a well designed, precision crafted top.Keep in Touch If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask - just scroll to the top and click on the comments to ask - I should be able to get back to you quickly.For more information about our work, check out:https://www.facebook.com/mitchlumMachinedhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/mitchlumMachinedhttps://www.instagram.com/mitchlum/https://www.facebook.com/joshuadawsonprecisions...https://www.facebook.com/groups/joshuadawsonpre...https://www.instagram.com/dawson_precision_spin... About MeI was born and raised in Hawaii.  As a high schooler my first job was in a high end custom stereo shop where a creative eye and the utmost attention to detail was critical for the elaborate installations we did.  I carried these early learnings with me to the mainland where I went to college and grad school getting my formal education in electrical engineering.I have been a hobby machinist for over a decade and a half, mostly making custom rings and pens in Timascus until March 2014, when I made my first spinning top.  I thought I might make 10, optimistically 20 tops before I ran out of friends and family who would want them.  After over three years, having made 250 tops one at a time on my Logan 1917, I’m extremely excited to collaborate with Joshua to produce a Made in the USA long spinning precision top, at a reasonable price.Trust and reliability.  As stated in the section at the top - those are two values that are of utmost importance to me - in my personal life, my day job, my hobbies and most importantly to you - on this campaign.  I have plans for future campaigns, and this being my first, I want you to have the confidence that Joshua and I will deliver.  We’ve got material in hand to make the first 100 tops, which will start machining while the campaign is running.  While the delivery date for that first batch states October, we have line of sight for hitting an earlier date.Precision and artistry.  I became a hobby machinist after a few years of collecting custom knives and meeting some of the most amazing metal artists in the world.  Tight tolerances combined with aesthetically beautiful design and materials selection excite me.  Those aspects of custom knives translate directly into custom tops - which besides making I’m also passionate about collecting.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div> Hi! How are you? </div>
<div>Let me tell you a bit about ourselves and our dream. We are Kate and Michael Sofoulis, a fifty-something couple who live in Heavenly Beverley, the best kept secret in the Avon Valley, one hundred and thirty kilometres  east of Perth.</div>
<div>We came here by choice four and a half years ago after Michael was forced to retire from the mining industry due to ill health.

Our intention is to create an artists' precinct.</div>
<div>We need your help to finish this project. Michael is a metal artist. He is also chief renovator. With a loan of $100,000 we have poured our hearts and souls into the building. We have run out of money. Michael has complex health issues and receives a Disability Support Pension.We are not eligible for another loan as I was injured at work and I am unable to return to my profession. We are ineligible for other funding as we are the independent owners of the East End Gallery. </div>
<div>So far, we have renovated three shops, Michael's studio and part of the back two roomed accommodation unit.  The ""residence"" still needs a kitchen and new floorboards, due to existing holes in the floor.</div>
<div>The Gallery itself has been open since December 2014. We still have to complete the final forty-five square metres to extend the Gallery to its full potential. In addition, the building is moving due to its drying out after decades of neglect. We have repaired all the old cracks; now we have new cracks to revisit.</div>
<div>We also hope to install kitchenettes and bathrooms into the first two shops (each is fifty-seven square metres). We hope, in time, to build mezzanine floors in each of the shops to provide extra living space. That way, we can offer two separate units in Beverley town centre for artists to live and work in. The East End Precinct would then be a reality.</div>
<div>We realise that we have champagne tastes on a lemonade budget. Yet, we feel that we understand the building and her challenges. We are used to being frugal and very imaginative.

 Hi! How are you? 
Let me tell you a bit about ourselves and our dream. We are Kate and Michael Sofoulis, a fifty-something couple who live in Heavenly Beverley, the best kept secret in the Avon Valley, one hundred and thirty kilometres  east of Perth.
We came here by choice four and a half years ago after Michael was forced to retire from the mining industry due to ill health.

So far, we have renovated three shops, Michael's studio and part of the back two roomed accommodation unit.  The ""residence"" still needs a kitchen and new floorboards, due to existing holes in the floor.

<strong> </strong><h3>Our story about P.S. I Miss You:</h3>
<p>If you ever had someone you cherish, read this......</p>
<p>This is my first ever Indiegogo project and I hope that you will support my little project that was inspired by some of the most precious person in my life.</p>
<p>After a series of sad abrupt departures recently, I was left to pick up the pieces in my life and to move on without saying a “former goodbye”. I vividly remember some of the wonderful moments with the departed and regretted that I had not done enough when my loved ones were still within reach. </p>
<p>These series of incident got me thinking about how we can really create something for everyone to show appreciation for their loved ones. At the same time, this “Gift” should be one that will ensure that we do not leave our loved ones without a word in the event when life steals us away. </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FY5MHNLRDLNo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DY5MHNLRDLNo&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FY5MHNLRDLNo%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<strong> </strong><h3> The Start of The Final Gift </h3>
<p>The idea of a traditional old style handwritten letter evolved. Stored in some place safe, this letter will allow the “Depositor” to deposit a letter that will only be sent to the intended person in the event he passed away. It is like leaving a legacy behind. This intended person, the “<b>RECIPIENT</b>” will know what the depositor would like to say…. </p>

<div>
<p>To ensure the letter is known and not lost in the “safehouse”, the idea of “<b>KEEPERs</b>” began. <b>KEEPERs</b> safeguard the arrangement and make sure that in the event the Recipient does not remember the arrangement, they are there to remind the Recipient of the last letter.</p>
<p>The concept behind the <b>FINAL GIFT </b>is created.....</p>
<p></p>

I Miss You:
If you ever had someone you cherish, read this......
This is my first ever Indiegogo project and I hope that you will support my little project that was inspired by some of the most precious person in my life.
After a series of sad abrupt departures recently, I was left to pick up the pieces in my life and to move on without saying a “former goodbye”. I vividly remember some of the wonderful moments with the departed and regretted that I had not done enough when my loved ones were still within reach. 
These series of incident got me thinking about how we can really create something for everyone to show appreciation for their loved ones. At the same time, this “Gift” should be one that will ensure that we do not leave our loved ones without a word in the event when life steals us away. 

  The Start of The Final Gift 
The idea of a traditional old style handwritten letter evolved. Stored in some place safe, this letter will allow the “Depositor” to deposit a letter that will only be sent to the intended person in the event he passed away. It is like leaving a legacy behind. This intended person, the “RECIPIENT” will know what the depositor would like to say…. 


To ensure the letter is known and not lost in the “safehouse”, the idea of “KEEPERs” began. KEEPERs safeguard the arrangement and make sure that in the event the Recipient does not remember the arrangement, they are there to remind the Recipient of the last letter.
The concept behind the FINAL GIFT is created.....


We added additional items to ensure that the Final Gift is a world class arrangement worthy of any users who only want the best for their cherished ones. We respect this inspiration that we are pursuing and we make sure, even if it was the sleepless night or multiple revisions to the drawing boards and plans, we continue to develop the FINAL GIFT to the same standard like we respect this notion. Our commitment is that we will only launch our FINAL GIFT if and only if we want to use it ourselves.


Now, the FINAL GIFT is 100% ready after a year. We make sure that we include all the necessary items to create the best FINAL GIFT for your cherished ones in The Final Gift Pack. We are ready to push it to mass production but require your support.


Aim 
We want to share our project with the community as it is based on cherishing each and every loved ones in our life. Not tomorrow or only Christmas but TODAY and NOW. We strongly believe every person should have someone the Final Gift is meant for.

We require the funding in order to push our product to mass-launch. We have 45 finished products for our first batch of the Final Gift as “Ground Zero”.
All for one and one for all. Share your testimonials of the times when you wished that someone could have left some words of relief behind.
Volunteer to help us to make videos revolving around this concept of “cherishness”.



  Stretched Goals 
If we hit USD 5,000, we will personally make a video (something you saw in our video list) to be sent exclusively to all contributors for you to send to your special cherished ones this Christmas. We will throw in a specially sourced sticker in every Final Gift Pack for you to decorate your letter better.

                                   by Cheri A Ellis
                                                      www.cheriaellis.com
A Bee Story dress is created with original artwork that tells a story about the BEE and its awe-inspiring, collaborative work.......pollinating humanity's world and filling it with honey, color and abundance.
                                         ""Bees work for the good of the whole""
Cheri A Ellis is a fashion designer and visual artist,  combining the 2 mediums in a project that creates awareness around the Bees and Colony Collapse Disorder.
                                                 www.facebook/cheri/ellis1



How does the dress tell a story about the Bee?
It begins with a story about a Bee .....and then a painting is created to illustrate the story ........




A graphite sketch  (below), digitally edited into a Bee galaxy. This story is about how  Bees collaborate and work together to make a golden sweet product that is             nourishing for them, and for the whole planet. A story about seed planting and making dreams come true, working together as one, for the 'good of the whole', and                                                     for the good of the planet.



               fashion look book @ www.NOTJUSTALABEL.com/CHERI_A_ELLIS


A painting named ""Ether Bees"" (below) , as Bees are truly celestial in the heavenly ways  they dance to communicate their needs to each other. The zig zag line is the                         'Waggle Dance', and is the pattern of their dance movement.




Three designs were digitally created from the painting ""Ether Bees"", and made into fabric, the dress below was designed and created to use the three designs in the most interesting way.






            fashion Look Book @ www.NOTJUSTALABEL.com/CHERI_A_ELLIS

                        The fabric design made from the ""Ether Bees"" painting.



The ""Yellow Star Seed"" painting made a nice collar for the dress, calico bias adds a     touch of 'sweet', and East Indian sequined clusters were added for the pollen.



    A backpack and grocery tote were made from the fabric, with Bee fabric lining.



                                          A wallet made with the Bee fabric.



The inside of the wallet is lined with fabrics from different Bee Story paintings, and                                 small Bee cards that say ""Love for the Bees"" 


                                             Brilliant Blue Bee                                           Bioluminescent Bee                                                   Trinity Bee                                         Blood Moon Queen Bee                                                                                      Day of the Dead Bee                                                                                          Celestial Hive Bee                                                                                            Boom Dragon Bee

                    How did the idea come about?

The idea came to Cheri after she found herself creating a lot of 'Yellow and Black' 



the ""Day of the Dead Bee""
""I had come to this point in my life, in my evolution as an artist, where I needed to re-direct my work and use it to give voice to a social cause I felt passionate about.

  the ""Tribal Bee""
   She came up with idea of digitally re-creating the paintings, having the designs                                     printed onto fabric, and sewing them into dresses.




the ""Blood Moon Queen Bee""

</h3><p><i>With arts rapidly disappearing from today's school systems and children being forced into the adult world sooner and sooner, the imagination is being left by the wayside.</i></p><p>Summerfest provides a break for about 400 children from the Warren, Ohio area annually. It is two-weeks of creative art workshops, designed to inspire and encourage youngsters, from four years and up, in the arts. <br/></p><p>The 
highly imaginative, age-grouped, workshops are organized around a 
unifying theme and taught by qualified professional teaching and working
 artist-instructors from the surrounding area.  This year's program will be held in the last two weeks of June.<br/></p><p>Summerfest also sends 
instructors off-site to several participating children’s organizations, 
at no cost to the organization or to their students.</p><p>We'd like your help in sponsoring this program, where children can spend two weeks just being kids, coloring outside the lines without consequences and opening their minds to creativity.</p><p><b>This year's Summerfest: Fiber Makes Art!</b></p><p></p><p>Many materials are used by artists to create
their work….stone is carved, wood is carved, sawn and assembled … metal is
hammered, melted and poured into molds … clay from the riverbed is formed by
hand and molded into shape.  <br/></p><p>Many artists
choose to use softer, more easily pliable materials for their works.  Fibers from animals and plants are
manipulated in any number of ways.  In
their simplest forms they are twisted, spun, and woven into fabrics, mats and
baskets.  Paper (made from wood fibers
and discarded cloth) is used in many artistic ways, from origami to pop-up
cards to unique designer clothing and jewelry. 
We will be taking time this year to look at the ways something so near
to us in our everyday lives can be transformed by the creative spirit.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><p><b>About the Trumbull Art Gallery: </b>Began in 1957 as 
Trumbull Art Guild, by area artists to support each other and dedicated 
to engaging the community in the arts. Summerfest began as a TAG program
 in 2004, it has grown from 60 participants to over 400 annually.</p><br/><h3>What We Need:<br/>
</h3><p>Funding raised will be used for art supplies and scholarships. Since TAG, is a 501(c)3 non-profit, we rely on the generosity of donors for everything from paintbrushes to glue bottles.</p><p>Currently Summerfest workshops are available at a very nominal fee. Scholarships are also available. Funding will be used to offset class fees and provide more scholarships for children in the area who would otherwise be unable to attend.<br/></p>If the full goal of $3,000 is not completely reached the funding will still be used in the same manner.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/601712/files/20140524103454-100_1675.JPG?1400952894"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>This arts festival for children culminates on the final day in a 
uniquely creative noon hour Summerfest Art Parade around Courthouse

With arts rapidly disappearing from today's school systems and children being forced into the adult world sooner and sooner, the imagination is being left by the wayside.Summerfest provides a break for about 400 children from the Warren, Ohio area annually. It is two-weeks of creative art workshops, designed to inspire and encourage youngsters, from four years and up, in the arts. The 
highly imaginative, age-grouped, workshops are organized around a 
unifying theme and taught by qualified professional teaching and working
 artist-instructors from the surrounding area.  This year's program will be held in the last two weeks of June.Summerfest also sends 
instructors off-site to several participating children’s organizations, 
at no cost to the organization or to their students.We'd like your help in sponsoring this program, where children can spend two weeks just being kids, coloring outside the lines without consequences and opening their minds to creativity.This year's Summerfest: Fiber Makes Art!Many materials are used by artists to create
their work….stone is carved, wood is carved, sawn and assembled … metal is
hammered, melted and poured into molds … clay from the riverbed is formed by
hand and molded into shape.  Many artists
choose to use softer, more easily pliable materials for their works.  Fibers from animals and plants are
manipulated in any number of ways.  In
their simplest forms they are twisted, spun, and woven into fabrics, mats and
baskets.  Paper (made from wood fibers
and discarded cloth) is used in many artistic ways, from origami to pop-up
cards to unique designer clothing and jewelry. 
We will be taking time this year to look at the ways something so near
to us in our everyday lives can be transformed by the creative spirit.About the Trumbull Art Gallery: Began in 1957 as 
Trumbull Art Guild, by area artists to support each other and dedicated 
to engaging the community in the arts. Summerfest began as a TAG program
 in 2004, it has grown from 60 participants to over 400 annually.What We Need:
Funding raised will be used for art supplies and scholarships. Since TAG, is a 501(c)3 non-profit, we rely on the generosity of donors for everything from paintbrushes to glue bottles.Currently Summerfest workshops are available at a very nominal fee. Scholarships are also available. Funding will be used to offset class fees and provide more scholarships for children in the area who would otherwise be unable to attend.If the full goal of $3,000 is not completely reached the funding will still be used in the same manner.Other Ways You Can HelpThis arts festival for children culminates on the final day in a 
uniquely creative noon hour Summerfest Art Parade around Courthouse 
Square in downtown Warren with all the participants, their family and 
friends, carrying and/or wearing their fanciful creations.  You are invited to join the parade.  Family friendly activities 
follow for about an hour after the parade.Feel free to friend TAG on Facebook for updates on other gallery and Summerfest events.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

Me</b></p>My
name is Raven Creature, and I am an artist who has lived in New
Orleans for eleven years. I started with a pencil, and moved on to
painting and sculpture, but came back to the pencil. It's simple yet
complex, limiting oneself to the pencil and simple paper. But within
these confines can come a look through someone else's eyes. I'm a
decent painter, but pencil is what I'm best at.<p><br/></p><p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>The

<p>Since
October 10 I started a new series of portraits of famous authors.
Each one of these is a pleasure to draw. I'm hoping to sell quality
signed prints of them, but I don't have the money to make the prints
so I've started this campaign. I'm also selling the originals, and
more, for contributions.</p>
<p>I've come up with all sorts of fun rewards for your donation, from a print,
an original, or even drawing lessons from me if you live in town!</p>
<p>The
funds go directly into my costs, which are not great, namely printing

</div></div>","About
MeMy
name is Raven Creature, and I am an artist who has lived in New
Orleans for eleven years. I started with a pencil, and moved on to
painting and sculpture, but came back to the pencil. It's simple yet
complex, limiting oneself to the pencil and simple paper. But within
these confines can come a look through someone else's eyes. I'm a
decent painter, but pencil is what I'm best at.
The
Project
Since
October 10 I started a new series of portraits of famous authors.
Each one of these is a pleasure to draw. I'm hoping to sell quality
signed prints of them, but I don't have the money to make the prints
so I've started this campaign. I'm also selling the originals, and
more, for contributions.
I've come up with all sorts of fun rewards for your donation, from a print,
an original, or even drawing lessons from me if you live in town!
The
funds go directly into my costs, which are not great, namely printing
the prints and the packaging. This will also give me a chance to see
which prints I will need to print more or less of, dictated by
demand.
At
the end of the campaign all of the completed author drawings will go
up to my solo show on January 11 at Byrdie's Gallery here in New
Orleans. Therefore all originals will be available once the show is
down, mid February.
I
hope that this project will excite you as much as it does me! I have
so far completed 18 original author drawings, and I'm not done yet!
As the campaign progresses I will post more drawings as soon as they
are complete. And, one of the perks is that you can decide which
author I do next!
The
Authors
I
started with Franz Kafka, author of “The Metamorphosis”. I just
love his viewpoint throughout the entire story! The photo I used as
reference was fairly flat so I had to “make up” some of the
features.
I
wanted to honor one of the creepiest writers, H.P. Lovecraft for
inventing (discovering) Cthulhu. The original for this is still available: ignore what it says for the ""Art Lover"" perk. For some reason I wrote in Lovecraft instead of Burroughs.
Next
I drew Edna St Vincent Millay, the lyrical poet and playwright.
Then
I wanted to do someone who was a prominent figure in some magickal
circles, so I drew Aleister Crowley.
Emily
Dickinson was hard because the best photo I could find of her was of
poor quality and she looked rather flat. I did what I did with Kafka,
made up her features as I imagined her to be.
Going
back to horror writers, I did Stephen King for shits and giggles. The
glasses were a challenge.
Living
in New Orleans I just had to next draw Anne Rice, who started off my
love of vampires when The Vampire Lestat first went to paperback. She
was hard because I don't try to draw teeth unless I have to, and 99%
of pictures of her were of her with this lovely smile!
Ayn
Rand is a figure that everyone has a strong reaction to. You either
love or hate her politics. She is known for The Fountainhead and
Atlas Shrugged.
William
S. Burroughs is a lot of things, to a lot of people. I first knew him
as author of Junkie and Naked Lunch, which I saw in the theater when
it came out. Brilliant, mad. I loved doing each wrinkle! This one may be sold!
Anais
Nin is known for, among other things, her erotica and journals. She
is the woman that the movie Henry and June was written by.

Lou
Reed, beloved musician, songwriter, and yes, an author was an immense
icon to an entire generation, and then some. This original is sold already!
And,
did you think I forgot my all time favorite author, Edgar Allen Poe?
Here he is!
The French author Colette, by commission. You can commission one, too!The Beat poet, Jack Kerouac.One of my personal faves, science fiction author Philip K. Dick!Mary Shelley, author of Frankenstein.The beloved author, Neil Gaiman!And my most recent author and playwright, Tennessee Williams.

</p><p><b>""London Structural Sound Project""
by Florian Tuercke</b></p>
<p></p><p>Artist Florian Tuercke together with
arebyte gallery intends to transform the area of Hackney Wick, East London and
its surroundings, to one with the highest density of public microphones in the
world. The project is participatory in its nature and invites the public to
take a crucial part in its production through the distribution of the
microphones thought out the vicinity of the gallery and in return offers an
unheard experience of their local area and of the city of London in general.</p>
<p>The Microphones are given free of charge
on first come first get basis or reserved as part of the crowd funding campaign.</p>
<p>The artist will assemble 300 mini-contact
microphones which will be handed out to visitors of arebyte gallery to be
installed in different locations in the vicinity of the gallery. The
contact-microphones record sound-waves within solid materials and enable the
listener to hear sounds which are normally inaudible to the human ear. Each
microphone will be packed in a bag containing simple instructions and mounting
material.</p>
<p><b>This is how the project goes:</b></p>
<p>As a visitor of the gallery you will receive
a bag that contains one microphone, mounting material and instructions (Few
bags will be placed in community centres and libraries). You are encouraged to
explore public space with the intention to find a suitable spot for mounting
your microphone. </p>
<p>You send a photo of the installed
microphone and a precise description of its location (street address or

Possible installation method *
This project apart from existing for
artistic endeavour will also encourage the public to engage with their local
area, re-examine the streets and structure of their surroundings and eventually
aims to deliver new experiences of familiar neighbourhoods and public spaces.
The project aims to achieve a
world-record in mapping structure-borne urban sounds and to instil pride in all involved with the
great ambitions of the artwork, which relies more heavily on public engagement
than capital input.The project is planned to launch on the
22nd of May and run until the 13th of June.*Images are from a smaller project that was held by Florian Tuercke in Turku (Finland) in 2011 and from a workshop which was part of Tuerckes last years project in Zaragoza (Spain) http://urban-audio.org/zaragoza.html, which was dealing with the musical transformation of traffic noise.You find more examples of previous works by Florian Tuercke on his website: http://floriantuercke.net/works.htmlfollow us on Facebook for news about the progress of the preparations: https://www.facebook.com/structural.sound.projectProject powered by arebyte gallery",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

2015 and the tour will end on July 8th, 2015. Along the way, I have been
 writing a book, ""In North America,"" about what these experiences have 
been like. A stream of consciousness and a look into touring 
independently. I explain what it is like to grow up in Phoenix, my 
families past and many more topics. I have also been taking photos to 
accompany these words. Paper Cut Press (NY) and I have partnered to put 
this book out on September 29th. I am also completing and recording a 
new album, ""This World,"" that will be released with ""In North America."" 
After the release I will tour Europe for 2 months! I can't do any of 
this without your help!</p><p>A very crucial part of this crowd funding campaign is getting the resources in order to record, mix and master my own music. This is something that I attempted while recording ""Life As It Seems"" (2014 with Bri White) and also ""Histories"" (2014) on my own. Because of my lack of resources, I have been frequently forced to borrow other musicians recording gear and computers to achieve the sound I want. I believe if given the proper resources to record my own material, I could create higher quality sounds and have the time to mix and master them properly. <b>Here is an example of a song that I recorded, mixed and mastered myself.</b></p><p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/rarielmusic/phoenix-unwise"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/rarielmusic/phoenix-unwise</a> <br/></p><p><b>Here are some articles about my latest album, 2015 tour and upcoming book with Papercut Press:</b></p><p><a href=""https://oneam.squarespace.com/interviews/#/r-ariel/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://oneam.squarespace.com/interviews/#/r-ariel/</a><a href=""http://londonfuse.ca/blog/10969"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><br/></span></a></p><p><a href=""http://londonfuse.ca/blog/10969"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://londonfuse.ca/blog/10969</span></a><br/> <a href=""http://beatroute.ca/tag/r-ariel/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://beatroute.ca/tag/r-ariel/</a><br/> <a href=""http://noisefestival.com/user/unwise/work/phoenix"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://noisefestival.com/user/unwise/work/phoenix</a><br/> <a href=""http://www.vueweekly.com/music-notes-apr-16-apr-22/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.vueweekly.com/music-notes-apr-16-apr-22/</a><br/> <a href=""http://flymagazine.net/go-3-live-music-picks-weekend/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://flymagazine.net/go-3-live-music-picks-weekend/</a><br/> <a href=""http://swelltonemusic.com/2015/05/digging-deeper-r-ariel-changer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://swelltonemusic.com/2015/05/digging-deeper-r-ariel-changer/</a><br/></p><p><a href=""http://www.thelaurelofasheville.com/editorial/web-exclusive-musician-r-ariel-makes-asheville-debut-at-the-crow-quill"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thelaurelofasheville.com/editorial/web-exclusive-musician-r-ariel-makes-asheville-debut-at-the-crow-quill</a></p><p><a href=""http://onlineathens.com/marquee/2015-06-04/lush-lines-rariel-brings-reverb-laden-world"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://onlineathens.com/marquee/2015-06-04/lush...</a></p><p><b>Here is a TV interview I did:</b></p><p><a href=""http://www.knoe.com/news/goodmorningarklamiss/headlines/R-Ariel-discusses-book-tour-and-album-308429781.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.knoe.com/news/goodmorningarklamiss/h...</a><br/></p><p><b>Here are some quotes that have been said of my music, writing and performances:</b><br/></p> ""This sounds like what

2015 and the tour will end on July 8th, 2015. Along the way, I have been
 writing a book, ""In North America,"" about what these experiences have 
been like. A stream of consciousness and a look into touring 
independently. I explain what it is like to grow up in Phoenix, my 
families past and many more topics. I have also been taking photos to 
accompany these words. Paper Cut Press (NY) and I have partnered to put 
this book out on September 29th. I am also completing and recording a 
new album, ""This World,"" that will be released with ""In North America."" 
After the release I will tour Europe for 2 months! I can't do any of 
this without your help!A very crucial part of this crowd funding campaign is getting the resources in order to record, mix and master my own music. This is something that I attempted while recording ""Life As It Seems"" (2014 with Bri White) and also ""Histories"" (2014) on my own. Because of my lack of resources, I have been frequently forced to borrow other musicians recording gear and computers to achieve the sound I want. I believe if given the proper resources to record my own material, I could create higher quality sounds and have the time to mix and master them properly. Here is an example of a song that I recorded, mixed and mastered myself.https://soundcloud.com/rarielmusic/phoenix-unwise Here are some articles about my latest album, 2015 tour and upcoming book with Papercut Press:https://oneam.squarespace.com/interviews/#/r-ariel/http://londonfuse.ca/blog/10969 http://beatroute.ca/tag/r-ariel/ http://noisefestival.com/user/unwise/work/phoenix http://www.vueweekly.com/music-notes-apr-16-apr-22/ http://flymagazine.net/go-3-live-music-picks-weekend/ http://swelltonemusic.com/2015/05/digging-deeper-r-ariel-changer/http://www.thelaurelofasheville.com/editorial/web-exclusive-musician-r-ariel-makes-asheville-debut-at-the-crow-quillhttp://onlineathens.com/marquee/2015-06-04/lush...Here is a TV interview I did:http://www.knoe.com/news/goodmorningarklamiss/h...Here are some quotes that have been said of my music, writing and performances: ""This sounds like what

My environment is filled with imagery that begs to be drawn, and what could be better than creating books full of designs for others who like to color? </p>
<p></p>
<p>I love drawing these images! The meditative comfort that many of us are finding with coloring is only surpassed by the calm relaxation I find while
sketching, sculpting and inking these pieces. What a happy meeting of hearts!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Did you know coloring reduces your heart rate, produces
friendly brain chemicals, and relieves stress? I like to think of everyone taking a nice long break (or lots of short breaks!) to color away, grow peaceful inside, and let the world
breathe for an hour or two.</p>

My drawing is
influenced by Maxfield Parrish, Kandinsky, Hunterwasser, and Dr. Seuss, to name
a few. I love scenes with a bit of whimsy that evoke a sense of story.
Another great love of mine is architectural shapes. Many
drawings in Hidden Realms include aspects of castles as well as fanciful versions of
architectural design. Flowery swirls and leafy lanes in scenes of an imagined Camelot appear in this collection. Decorative bits of ancient kings and queens weave their way into patterns framed in handcrafted borders. My drawings contain ""brain-friendly"" repeating curves and varying lengths which contribute to the calming action of coloring. <br/><br/>I want my coloring books to be comfortable and reassuring, even if some images present a bit of a challenge. In addition to the more complex designs I call ""Gallery"" pieces, I've created more pages where you can freely experiment, archive your colors, and try things out without worrying about ""making it look good."" During this campaign I'll share samples of Gallery pieces, as well as ""Simplers"" (they take less time to complete than the Gallery pieces), and ""Little Quicklys,"" which are perfect for a break in your day, a coloring party, or for the kids around the table. My ""Color Keepers"" have special shapes for comparing your colors, trying out new pens or pencils, and keeping your notes. <br/><br/>In the Special Set for this campaign, the Gallery pieces are printed on card stock good for framing, and the other pages are printed on heavy, durable paper for a great coloring experience.<br/><br/><p>Your help with the Coloring Camelot campaign will allow me to bring these drawings into a fine print form, ready for your pens and pencils. <br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Goals and Outcomes</h3>
<div>The first goal is set at $750.00, which will allow me to bring Coloring Camelot's first set, ""Hidden Realms,"" into print, as well as making it available through a number of distribution vehicles. </div>Beyond the first goal, I'd like to continue with ""Fog-Fed Gardens,"" a purse-sized coloring book that is made for travel. If we reach $2500, I'll be able to produce this special set and bring it to print. The images in ""Fog-Fed Gardens"" come straight from my walks around Marin county, and include visitors from farther north along the verdant Pacific coast. Gardens full of flowers and lovely salvaged creations also make up the smaller images which can be colored in a half hour or so.<br/>
<div>
<br/>There are more goals to come, so let's find out how many coloring enthusiasts are out there! </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3> <p>How do these images come into being? I begin with pencil sketches in my journal.  In order to create the repeating images that so many color-ers enjoy, I employ some digital techniques. Then the image gets printed, redrawn, and inked by hand. The extra steps take me to a sweet spot, where the lines are flowing, which I want to attain before I decide it is finished. </p>
<p>Before anything gets drawn, however, I have to go off on a walk. Walking around Marin county and other points north, I find myself staring at endlessly entertaining gardens and structures, some traditional, some ridiculous, and many outrageously beautiful plantings. I may take a photo or sketch it on the spot. Sometimes, as I'm walking, I get an image in my head of a scene I want to draw. I'm captivated by certain shapes such as the fleur-de-lys and totem-like finials, so you may notice them here and there in my drawings. </p>
<p>I also listen closely to coloring enthusiasts I've joined in online forums. I have learned a great deal about what makes a drawing appealing for this use, and especially what makes them meditative and healing to color. Thank you to all the participants in forums who make it easier to know what and how to draw images for you!</p>
<p>If you love to color but can't contribute right now, you are certainly welcome to help share the word about Coloring Camelot! Everyone is invited to use the share tools here on the campaign.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a="""">I know what it's like to go hungry. I know what it's like to lose everything. But I also know what it's like to have everything change when someone lifted me up. Countless volunteers around the country give of their time and finances to help people that they may never meet, all without recognition or any form of compensation. Were it not for people like that, I wouldn't be here today. <br/><br/>This project is very personal to me. It's my attempt to repay those who have given me so much. At the same time, I hope to see the dialogue surrounding hunger change. It's not about statistics or some kind of political agenda - it's about people. So many folks are hurting and in need of a hand. By speaking with volunteers around the country and telling their stories, I hope to put a human face to the issue of hunger.<br/><br/>I believe that a strong community is one that looks out for the marginalized, the weak, and the hurting. Let's give them hope and recognize the men and women who work so hard to see that happen.<br/><br/><b>What the deuce is Ten Sixty-Six?<br/></b><br/>Ten Sixty-Six is the number of miles I will walk from my home in Columbus to reach the heart of Dallas, Texas. It's also the name of the book I will create when this journey is over. I think it sounds sweet.<br/><br/><b>How's this all going down?<br/><br/></b>I'm not affiliated with any organization. I'm just a dude who wants to do something good for my community. In order to do that, I've established a relationship with a local food bank who has provided me with contacts across the country and an inside look at what it takes to feed a city. <br/><br/>Over the next few months I will be making connections with food banks in major cities between Columbus and Dallas. I will depart on September 1 and plan to return home in early December. When I arrive in each city, I'll stay for 2 to 3 days to personally volunteer, meet the staff, and interview volunteers.<br/><br/>I'm beginning this journey on September 1 of this year, and the goal is to make it to Dallas in time for Thanksgiving. I'd like to be there to volunteer at a soup kitchen on Thanksgiving day.<br/><br/>After I complete my journey, I'll then fly home and begin the work of putting together a book that compiles all of the interviews and portraits of volunteers. Lucky for me, my roommate is a French Lit PhD and professor at OSU, and he will edit the writing so that the book is the best it can be. The end result will be a coffee table book full of illustrations and interviews that I hope will inspire others to volunteer in their own way. And the best thing of all is that half of the proceeds of the book will go directly to a local food bank here in central Ohio. It's a win/win.<br/><br/>Oh! And one last thing... Throughout the actual hike, I'll maintain a daily blog with photos and stories of the journey (blog site to be determined). This is a community endeavor, so I want to keep in touch with everyone involved.<br/><br/><b>Why hike to Texas?<br/></b><br/>A lot of people ask me this, and I have a few answers for those folks: <br/><br/>1. My story of hunger hit the hardest when I lived in Dallas in the summer of 2005. I think about those times often, so in a way it's a pilgrimage to where it all began for me. <br/><br/>2. I don't believe that anyone can fully sympathize with need unless they walk in it. To give the most honest account I possibly can, I will be living day to day out of my backpack for three months. It's not the easiest way to tell a story, but I believe that it's the most authentic way to connect with those in need and those who give.<br/><br/>3. The current discussion of hunger in this nation turns my stomach. I want to see every discussion about hunger involve reaching out to those in need, but unfortunately those aren't the stories that are most often told. I want to see the dialogue move from skepticism to compassion, and this type of project provides a platform to make voices heard. If walking halfway across the country creates buzz and elevates the discussion, then let's do this!<br/><br/><b>Where does the money go?</b><br/><br/>1. I'll need to buy more equipment to make the journey to Texas. I need a tent, all-weather clothing, boots, food, hotels for when I stop to volunteer in each city, and a plane ticket home.<br/><br/>2. I have a full-time job as an illustrator for a super awesome company, but I'll have to step away for a while to make this thing happen. By pledging above and beyond the 20k goal (please, please, please!), I'll be able to take a bit more time before heading back to work and make this the best art of my life. In short, the more you give, the more time I'll have to dedicate to make the best book possible (and your pledge perks!). A huge thanks in advance for this!<br/><br/>3. Last, but certainly not least, I believe that good work deserves to be fairly compensated. My wonderfully talented photographer and videographer has worked very hard to help me promote this project, and I refuse to ask for a discount for her services. So she gets a cut. I will also compensate my wicked-smart roommate for his editing prowess when the book is written. Again, good work deserves a good wage. <br/><br/><b>When do I receive my perks?</b><br/><br/>The very first thing to be sent out is the ""Thank You"" postcard. Those will be printed this summer and shipped by September 1. The rest of the art won't begin to be made until after I return home in December. Handmade art takes time, and that's why I've kept all of the custom pieces in short supply. I anticipate shipping finished art pieces from spring through summer 2016. The book will take longer to complete, and I am estimating closer to autumn or winter of 2016 before it's completed and printed. I will be sure to keep everyone posted with any updates as well as anticipated shipping dates. <br/><br/><b>What's up with all of the postcards?</b><br/><br/>When I think something is cool, I'm all about telling people about it.

But I also know what it's like to have everything change when someone lifted me up. Countless volunteers around the country give of their time and finances to help people that they may never meet, all without recognition or any form of compensation. Were it not for people like that, I wouldn't be here today. This project is very personal to me. It's my attempt to repay those who have given me so much. At the same time, I hope to see the dialogue surrounding hunger change. It's not about statistics or some kind of political agenda - it's about people. So many folks are hurting and in need of a hand. By speaking with volunteers around the country and telling their stories, I hope to put a human face to the issue of hunger.I believe that a strong community is one that looks out for the marginalized, the weak, and the hurting. Let's give them hope and recognize the men and women who work so hard to see that happen.What the deuce is Ten Sixty-Six?Ten Sixty-Six is the number of miles I will walk from my home in Columbus to reach the heart of Dallas, Texas. It's also the name of the book I will create when this journey is over. I think it sounds sweet.How's this all going down?I'm not affiliated with any organization. I'm just a dude who wants to do something good for my community. In order to do that, I've established a relationship with a local food bank who has provided me with contacts across the country and an inside look at what it takes to feed a city. Over the next few months I will be making connections with food banks in major cities between Columbus and Dallas. I will depart on September 1 and plan to return home in early December. When I arrive in each city, I'll stay for 2 to 3 days to personally volunteer, meet the staff, and interview volunteers.I'm beginning this journey on September 1 of this year, and the goal is to make it to Dallas in time for Thanksgiving. I'd like to be there to volunteer at a soup kitchen on Thanksgiving day.After I complete my journey, I'll then fly home and begin the work of putting together a book that compiles all of the interviews and portraits of volunteers. Lucky for me, my roommate is a French Lit PhD and professor at OSU, and he will edit the writing so that the book is the best it can be. The end result will be a coffee table book full of illustrations and interviews that I hope will inspire others to volunteer in their own way. And the best thing of all is that half of the proceeds of the book will go directly to a local food bank here in central Ohio. It's a win/win.Oh! And one last thing... Throughout the actual hike, I'll maintain a daily blog with photos and stories of the journey (blog site to be determined). This is a community endeavor, so I want to keep in touch with everyone involved.Why hike to Texas?A lot of people ask me this, and I have a few answers for those folks: 1. My story of hunger hit the hardest when I lived in Dallas in the summer of 2005. I think about those times often, so in a way it's a pilgrimage to where it all began for me. 2. I don't believe that anyone can fully sympathize with need unless they walk in it. To give the most honest account I possibly can, I will be living day to day out of my backpack for three months. It's not the easiest way to tell a story, but I believe that it's the most authentic way to connect with those in need and those who give.3. The current discussion of hunger in this nation turns my stomach. I want to see every discussion about hunger involve reaching out to those in need, but unfortunately those aren't the stories that are most often told. I want to see the dialogue move from skepticism to compassion, and this type of project provides a platform to make voices heard. If walking halfway across the country creates buzz and elevates the discussion, then let's do this!Where does the money go?1. I'll need to buy more equipment to make the journey to Texas. I need a tent, all-weather clothing, boots, food, hotels for when I stop to volunteer in each city, and a plane ticket home.2. I have a full-time job as an illustrator for a super awesome company, but I'll have to step away for a while to make this thing happen. By pledging above and beyond the 20k goal (please, please, please!), I'll be able to take a bit more time before heading back to work and make this the best art of my life. In short, the more you give, the more time I'll have to dedicate to make the best book possible (and your pledge perks!). A huge thanks in advance for this!3. Last, but certainly not least, I believe that good work deserves to be fairly compensated. My wonderfully talented photographer and videographer has worked very hard to help me promote this project, and I refuse to ask for a discount for her services. So she gets a cut. I will also compensate my wicked-smart roommate for his editing prowess when the book is written. Again, good work deserves a good wage. When do I receive my perks?The very first thing to be sent out is the ""Thank You"" postcard. Those will be printed this summer and shipped by September 1. The rest of the art won't begin to be made until after I return home in December. Handmade art takes time, and that's why I've kept all of the custom pieces in short supply. I anticipate shipping finished art pieces from spring through summer 2016. The book will take longer to complete, and I am estimating closer to autumn or winter of 2016 before it's completed and printed. I will be sure to keep everyone posted with any updates as well as anticipated shipping dates. What's up with all of the postcards?When I think something is cool, I'm all about telling people about it. Postcards give an opportunity to create tangible pieces of art that can be send to friends and family all over the country. I want to get people talking about hunger and volunteering in a different way. This gives me (and you!) that kind of platform. Plus, postcards just look really cool!I've never seen your art before, so what style can I expect?I have a few images that will give you an idea of what your perks will look like.""Thank You"" Postcard:This is a mockup of the image that ultimately become the ""Thank You"" postcard. The image will be redrawn over the next month to represent my more realistic style, but this gives you the direction of this particular piece.Portraits:I love black and white, and I love lines! When you see the lines in a person's face, you see a story that words can't tell. This mockup gives you an idea of what your portrait will look like, as well as the portrait postcards.Chalkboards:I've been very fortunate in my art career and it all started with chalkboards. I made this one for NHL player James Wisniewski. Everything I do is freehand, but I work very hard to make sure that everything is centered and consistent. No matter what you want on a chalkboard, I can recreate it. Bold colors, black and white, you name it. The only thing that I won't be able to do is blended colors (that takes traditional chalk, and that is something that I won't ship since it will smudge).Here's another example of chalk work that I've done in Columbus.

<p>No Going Back began in 2012, providing free legal advice and representation for LGBTQ immigrants seeking asylum in the UK on the grounds they would be persecuted (and often put to death) in their home countries because of their sexual orientation.  With major cutbacks in legal aid, major language barriers typically faced by applicants and a judicial system often biased against claimants and seeking 'proof' of sexuality, NGB's mandate was grounded in ensuring that at least cost would not be a barrier for its clients, and that we would do whatever was in our power to advocate on their behalf and seek the justice they deserve.</p>
<p>Duality Books is publishing a monograph series, '1 Model &amp; 100 Artists', the sales proceeds of which will go towards NGB's work with asylum seekers. </p>
<p>To complement their bold work we will be holding an exhibition and auction in Leeds and possibly London for all original pieces going towards to the publication. </p>
<p>We could use your help to really make this a successful, amazing event that both raises awareness and funds for a powerful and often overlooked cause!  Any and all funds raised would contribute to raising the exhibition(s) and covering any costs accruing from gallery hire, event promotions, framing, catering and transport of art work between depot and events sites as well as in sending costs (if required) to purchasers.  Hopefully, we can get as many donations as possible to increase the amount that can go back into our services, with raised funds making up the shortfall.</p>

<div>Like with anything there are risks.  This project is no exception.  There is the possibility art works don't sell, either at all or in only small quantities.  Of the 100 artists contributing to the book possibly very few may donate their originals for sale, even though there has been a significant amount of interest to the contrary. Horror of horrors, a gallery space that has been donated (if only in part) may pull out!  These funds would enable us to mitigate many of these circumstance, especially the last one.  And though we cannot guess on the turnout to the events, or the financial outcome, we at least have secured free gallery space in Leeds that comes with equally free promotion, and in a venue - The White Cloth Gallery - known for its trendy atmosphere and cutting-edge exhibitions.</div>

Working on the ideals and vision of Danna Nordin, past Las Vegas poet and resident who created a vision for the current poetry scene. With her inspiration the organization was created to bring unity to an artform that crosses and interwines with other artforms including music, theater, and art.  The organization was founded by local poet/artist Jorge Lara Santiago (www.immortalizer.net).The organization has gone through various iterations throughout the years, having in the past established an executive and advisory board as well as having created a volunteer board.

<p>The idea behind these shows is two-fold; We want to introduce artists from one

represented by galleries don't have to PAY to have their work shown. Artists
won't pay ""hanging fees” or a percentage of any sale to anyone. They get
all the money (the only POSSIBLE fee might be something nominal for
transportation...and if we make enough money with this? They won't even have to
pay that). </p>
<p>The money will be used to rent the space, pay for insurance, set up the
space, hang the art, transport the art (transporting art across the country is
expensive), pay for various non-sponsored refreshments and promotion of the
event.</p>
<p>The event will consist of an opening night and remain open a few days after
(ideally a Friday opening and remain open Saturday and Sunday). If we raise
enough money or get appropriate sponsors we may have some sort of brunch event

To meet this demand, event organizers are working closely with city officials and local businesses to keep this event safe, fun and FREE for zombies and spectators of all ages.-While it is exciting and humbling to have created such a successful event, it also means that the costs of producing an event of this size have also grown accordingly. The Sacramento Zombie Walk NEEDS YOUR HELP to continue this tradition in Sacramento. With the necessary expansions this year, costs have again increased and organizers need to raise $5000.00 to cover hard costs alone (permits, police street closures, security, insurance, porta-potties, waste management and entertainment costs).-For contributing, not only do you know that you are helping continue this exciting tradition of the Undead in Sacramento, but we'll also throw in some fun and unique perks for donating to the cause. Every dollar raised will go toward making this event even more awesome and exciting than any other year!  -Please help TFO celebrate 17 years of Zombie Walks in Sacramento, take over a city park and fill the streets with the Undead to make this the biggest and best local ZOMBIE event ever! Contribute if you can and please share and repost.NOTE: Most Perks will be available for pick up AT the 2017 ZOMBIE WALK August 26, 2017. If you are unable to attend, delivery can be arranged.**Paintings will be 11x14 on Canvas, donor must provide photo reference. Finished art will be delivered by June 30, 2018***To receive Carnival Tickets and Zombie Make-Up perks, you must attend the event Aug. 26th*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_walk",0.0,0,"13 Campaigns

<h3>We Need a Projector</h3>
<p>The Shed has the opportunity to exhibit the work of Lynn Hunter, but will need to purchase a video projector for the exhibition. The budget for this project includes the cost of a projector, and a modest honorarium for the artist. The video projector will remain the property of The Shed, and can be used for future exhibitions as well. </p>
<p>In her work, performance artist Lynn Hunter risks trusting the viewer. Her physically and emotionally vulnerable endurance pieces are steeped in the shared empathy between herself and those present for the performance. Viewers of her work confront their feelings towards the endurance of the everyday Black woman. A conversation which is specific and distinct to each individual, given their own relationship to Black imagination, pain, and triumph.</p>
<p>For her solo exhibition at The Shed, Hunter will perform one of her <i>Grounded</i> burial pieces, in which the artist lies on the ground buried under soil. Artifacts from this performance will remain in the space prior to and after the performance and a video projection on the ceiling adds context to the events in the space. Viewers may experience this work by witnessing Hunter’s live performance, or they may place themselves in the center of the work, lying in a hammock that will stand in place of the artist during the remainder of the exhibition.</p>
<h3>About Lynn Hunter</h3>
<p>Lynn Hunter is a multimedia performance artist and Baltimore native. Her work inspires empathy and engages audiences in deconstructing their preconceptions of amerikan identity and Black culture while exploring new boundaries of imagination and Black presence. Hunter earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree concentrated in Photography from the Maryland Institute College of Art. She has held internships at the Aperture Foundation in New York City and at the Baltimore Museum of Art. She has exhibited in Labbodies’ Annual Performance Art Reviews, Artscape, Free Fall Baltimore, Motor House, Eubie Blake, and several local collectives. Lynn recently completed a residency at the Lemon Tree House in Cetona, Italy.</p>
<h3>About The Shed</h3>
<p>The Shed is an artist-run exhibition space in the backyard of Baltimore artist, Bonnie Crawford. Crawford opened The Shed as a space where artists can exhibit their work through the pandemic, when traditional exhibition opportunities have been scarce.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Featuring over 70 national and international artists from France, Germany, Mexico, Japan, Spain, London, Austria, Italy, United Arab Emirites, Portugal, Ireland, Africa, and the US, the alchemy of CONTENT is in bringing artists together from all over the world via the web, and then placing their work in an exhibition space. </p>

<p class=""p1""><em>Although the dawn of the internet has graced us with more global perspectives philosophically, we believe that we also crave the physical accounts of current ideas. The event of curating beyond pixeled space results in an unusually personal international conversation and inspires a new wave of thinking and collaborating in reality. With the ease of technology we are able to connect beyond previously prohibitive boundaries and have the ability to collaborate via email, social media, and websites to make conversations happen from all points of the globe. Artists, writers, and thinkers together have a platform that is both global and intimate, usually without the restrictions and degradation of politics, religion, and war. Arthur Clarke pronounced that “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” This is our launching pad.</em></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">We take great joy in inviting <a href=""http://www.coffeeandsponge.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coffee &amp; Sponge</a> to Athens to be the inaugural artists in our artist-in-residence program. Their work was selected due to our joint commonalities and interests, in particular their interest in collaborating with our immediate community to create work specific to our location and its similarities and distinctions with their community in Bow, London. The host gallery, <a href=""http://www.athica.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ATHICA</a>, is located in a popular but low-income warehouse district that hosts a variety of creative enterprises and the participation of Coffee &amp; Sponge is invaluable - they will not only bring the dedication and perseverance that we cherish, but their conceptual backbone and interest in making the global local will enrich our community for years to come.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The first week of residency will comprise of Coffee &amp; Sponge getting to know Athens and its environs and people. When the research is ready, their studio hours will be held daily through September 22, with technical rehearsals happening September 23-26 and <strong>the world premiere of their new work debuting on September 28 at ATHICA*</strong>.</span></p>
<p>The first of its kind in Athens, the curators of CONTENT are arranging the following as part of our artist-in-residence program:</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>a work studio for one month with close proximity to the gallery that includes a part-time studio assistant/intern as well as a volunteer crew for installation/tech/sound</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>living accommodations in the neighborhood of the gallery</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>the opportunity to teach up to 10 workshops in the gallery with the rental fee waived</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>figure drawing classes for adults in various university settings &amp; in the gallery</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>figure drawing classes for children in the gallery</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>featured work in a full-color exhibition catalogue printed in an edition of 250</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>* Should we not reach our entire goal, all funds will go to the exhibition and publication as well as to artist stipends and shipping of artwork, and we will reintroduce our efforts in the future to create this very important residency</p>

What happens when something on the internet becomes tangible? When experiments leap off the screen and into real space? What shifts occur in our psyches?
CONTENT is an exhibition that connects the art of the essay, poetry, fiction, photography, drawing, sculpture, video, film, music, and performance - all culled from the internet. Hosted by ATHICA: Athens Institute for Contemporary Art, the curators, Darin Beasley (Marco Polo Arts Mag, Tiger Train) and Hope Hilton (Artistic Director, ATHICA), are bringing the world to Athens, Georgia, USA on September 7, 2013.
Featuring over 70 national and international artists from France, Germany, Mexico, Japan, Spain, London, Austria, Italy, United Arab Emirites, Portugal, Ireland, Africa, and the US, the alchemy of CONTENT is in bringing artists together from all over the world via the web, and then placing their work in an exhibition space. 

Although the dawn of the internet has graced us with more global perspectives philosophically, we believe that we also crave the physical accounts of current ideas. The event of curating beyond pixeled space results in an unusually personal international conversation and inspires a new wave of thinking and collaborating in reality. With the ease of technology we are able to connect beyond previously prohibitive boundaries and have the ability to collaborate via email, social media, and websites to make conversations happen from all points of the globe. Artists, writers, and thinkers together have a platform that is both global and intimate, usually without the restrictions and degradation of politics, religion, and war. Arthur Clarke pronounced that “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” This is our launching pad.
We are setting a precedent for exhibiting international artists alongside national and local artists in our small city. Please join us in creating an artist residency, printing a full-color publication, bringing world-renowned poets to read, and assisting with shipping expenses to make our exhibition come to life. You can help us create a global art conversation in Athens, Georgia.

ABOUT THE RESIDENCY

We take great joy in inviting Coffee & Sponge to Athens to be the inaugural artists in our artist-in-residence program. Their work was selected due to our joint commonalities and interests, in particular their interest in collaborating with our immediate community to create work specific to our location and its similarities and distinctions with their community in Bow, London. The host gallery, ATHICA, is located in a popular but low-income warehouse district that hosts a variety of creative enterprises and the participation of Coffee & Sponge is invaluable - they will not only bring the dedication and perseverance that we cherish, but their conceptual backbone and interest in making the global local will enrich our community for years to come.
The first week of residency will comprise of Coffee & Sponge getting to know Athens and its environs and people. When the research is ready, their studio hours will be held daily through September 22, with technical rehearsals happening September 23-26 and the world premiere of their new work debuting on September 28 at ATHICA*.
The first of its kind in Athens, the curators of CONTENT are arranging the following as part of our artist-in-residence program:


a work studio for one month with close proximity to the gallery that includes a part-time studio assistant/intern as well as a volunteer crew for installation/tech/sound




living accommodations in the neighborhood of the gallery


the opportunity to teach up to 10 workshops in the gallery with the rental fee waived


figure drawing classes for adults in various university settings & in the gallery


figure drawing classes for children in the gallery


featured work in a full-color exhibition catalogue printed in an edition of 250


* Should we not reach our entire goal, all funds will go to the exhibition and publication as well as to artist stipends and shipping of artwork, and we will reintroduce our efforts in the future to create this very important residency

THE IMPACT - YOUR IMPACT - OF BRING THE GLOBAL LOCAL
Athens, Georgia is a small city with unique and inventive cultural production and we aim to nurture a more global view and influence. With your contribution, we are able to access art that is otherwise only accessible via the internet, and create a conversation that impacts our city, propelling it into the global conversation about art for years to come. With the inclusion of the residency with Coffee & Sponge we are able to host a world premiere of new work created specifically for the gallery. As well as assisting with the hosting workshops, lectures, and events with special guests Ariana Reines, David Trinidad, Cody John Laplante, and Sabrina Orah Mark, we have musical events happening all over the city to coincide with gallery programming that include the bands Spirit Tramp, TONDA,  Rene' LeConte, Strays, Manny and the Deepthroats , The Visitations, Glasscrafts, T S Woodward, and Darnell Boys.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>For years, I’ve traveled the country in search of fallen, forgotten trees destined for landfills and chippers. My goal has always been to transform these hunks of waste wood into beautiful pieces of art -- to make people consider these objects from a new perspective. My most recent work, The Ball Project, features a collection of enormous wooden balls sourced from an array of different species, some of which are very rare. As an environmentalist dedicated to turning the mundane into the treasured, I began this project to showcase the crevices and distinctions these pieces of wood exhibit, exposing a depth of beauty that would otherwise be lost.</p>
<div>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The balls vary in size, many weighing in at over a ton. In order to create these balls on such a large scale, I modified my truck into a custom, unprecedented sculptural tool called The Scorpion. For me, the size matters. There’s a certain impact a piece of wood can have when it takes up so much space.</span></p>
<p><span>Each ball tells its own unique story -- from its particular species to the land that fostered its growth to the storm that took it down. My goal is to honor that history and display it in a way that’s interesting and thought provoking. The real art is in the process of exposing layer after layer of the wood's background, working with the wood to bring out its blemishes, bumps and fragments of decay.</span></p>
<p><span>Finding the raw material has become an intuitive and broad journey in itself, from stumbled-upon fallen tree trunks to calls from strangers offering to donate a rare species growing on their property. A few years ago I was the subject of a short video and to my surprise, it went viral. This experience has not only expanded my networks in terms of finding wood, but it’s also shown me that people are truly interested in supporting this project. You can watch that video here: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/41892788"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/41892788</a></span><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>About The Red Hook Woodlot</span></h3>
<p>After years of transient and limited workspaces, I’ve found the perfect place to house both The Scorpion and my growing collection of wood balls. The Red Hook Woodlot is an open air studio near the Brooklyn waterfront. With this space, I will finally to expand the project, preserving more trees into beautiful works of art. My ultimate goal is to create and display at total of 108 wooden balls at the Woodlot, inviting fellow artists, woodturners, musicians and neighbors alike to use the space as a gathering ground for ideas, collaboration and creativity.</p>

</div></div>","For years, I’ve traveled the country in search of fallen, forgotten trees destined for landfills and chippers. My goal has always been to transform these hunks of waste wood into beautiful pieces of art -- to make people consider these objects from a new perspective. My most recent work, The Ball Project, features a collection of enormous wooden balls sourced from an array of different species, some of which are very rare. As an environmentalist dedicated to turning the mundane into the treasured, I began this project to showcase the crevices and distinctions these pieces of wood exhibit, exposing a depth of beauty that would otherwise be lost.

The balls vary in size, many weighing in at over a ton. In order to create these balls on such a large scale, I modified my truck into a custom, unprecedented sculptural tool called The Scorpion. For me, the size matters. There’s a certain impact a piece of wood can have when it takes up so much space.
Each ball tells its own unique story -- from its particular species to the land that fostered its growth to the storm that took it down. My goal is to honor that history and display it in a way that’s interesting and thought provoking. The real art is in the process of exposing layer after layer of the wood's background, working with the wood to bring out its blemishes, bumps and fragments of decay.
Finding the raw material has become an intuitive and broad journey in itself, from stumbled-upon fallen tree trunks to calls from strangers offering to donate a rare species growing on their property. A few years ago I was the subject of a short video and to my surprise, it went viral. This experience has not only expanded my networks in terms of finding wood, but it’s also shown me that people are truly interested in supporting this project. You can watch that video here: https://vimeo.com/41892788

 
About The Red Hook Woodlot
After years of transient and limited workspaces, I’ve found the perfect place to house both The Scorpion and my growing collection of wood balls. The Red Hook Woodlot is an open air studio near the Brooklyn waterfront. With this space, I will finally to expand the project, preserving more trees into beautiful works of art. My ultimate goal is to create and display at total of 108 wooden balls at the Woodlot, inviting fellow artists, woodturners, musicians and neighbors alike to use the space as a gathering ground for ideas, collaboration and creativity.


What We Need & What You Get:
The money raised will go towards building the Red Hook Woodlot and keeping it open, providing a space for me to create and showcase The Ball Project. The space will also be used for community and art events. 
All donations made to this Indiegogo campaign are tax deductible. 
The Impact: 
The driving force behind my work is to value art, community and our environment. Each piece showcases a history, inviting viewers to consider the tree’s origin, its growth and its ultimate journey back into the earth.

Art Therapy Nepal - 
I first visited Nepal in 1992 as a wide-eyed traveler exploring the mountains, monasteries and the wonders of this amazing country.  My experiences there had a huge impact on my life and way of seeing the world.  Years later, when my friend Ashwin told me about his work with children in Nepal, I jumped at the opportunity to get involved. Since 2007, Nepal House counsellors have been using play, art and talk therapies to help children 
facing a range of challenges including trauma, poverty, illness, exploitation, and neglect.  This
 winter, I am very excited to be making my second trip as a volunteer with Nepal House.  I am part of a group of professionals who bring their knowledge and skills to Nepal, to help educate and build capacity for local people. This December, I will offer several child art therapy workshops to the Nepali counsellors and teachers working at Nepal House. This video is a short clip from our first art therapy training at Nepal House in 2008

The Artist-Humankind:
Location-Earth project was created by nationally board certified art therapist, Beth Ann Short, to provide any
individual the opportunity to share their own experience of life through mixed
media art making and self-portraiture.  The final outcome will be an exhibition and small press art book documenting the process.

The funding of this project will make it NO COST TO THE PARTICIPATING INDIVIDUALS in the pilot session!  Participants in the pilot session of this workshop will experience some basic fine art education in using fine art media as well as support through six scheduled meetings.  In addition to learning about
the historical use of self-portraiture and subject matter content in story
telling throughout time, participants will examine the concept of roles in life
that guide our behaviors, rights and obligations through the social experience in
social status, social community and expectations of others.  Throughout the process participants will have therapeutic support.  Artists will also have the opportunity to access the art studio individually, in addition to the scheduled group meetings if they wish.  Participants in this project may have, but need not have any experience in fine art technique.   

The pilot will focus on the roles of: Mother/Father/Parent/Caregiver.  Self-portraits created will be in response to the group process.    


The Impact
ART SAVES LIVES
The Benefits?  
In this pilot project participants will examine their own experience of mother/father/parent/caregiver in relation to the others in the group.  Individuals will experience increased ability to use
creativity in self-care, managing anxiety, as well as in problem solving while gaining insight
into past, present and future life choices through this process.  Furthermost, participants will explore
self-perception and personal role identity formation while exploring and
engaging with others in core group finding normalcy in their experience, while
translating their own experience in their unique art voice.


In addition to individual benefits, the community on a whole will also be impacted by the art show and publication.  Even people who don't make the art can learn from the experience just by coming into contact with the art!

<h3>Funk Yeah!  The Mothership   She needs you...</h3>
<p>To all those that have been touched by the Funk.....We need you now.</p>
<p><br/>We are obsessed with the funk! My name is Reilly and together with my wife and partner Misty, we own the FUNK YEAH! It has been our pleasure to ride the playa and bring funky transportation to all of you through the years. </p>
<p>The FUNK YEAH! rolled onto the playa for her debut in 2008 and has brought the funk in so many ways over the years it makes me happy everytime I think about her. Bringing the funk from old school to new school while keeping it fresh has been the FUNK YEAH!'s mission from day 1. </p>
<p>Our collection of FUNK music is a result of a lifetime of gathering rare grooves and old school collections. Our main collection is over 200 GB of music and it is quite an honor to bring it to BurningMan. Funk is such a necessary music form on the playa especially when it balances out the dubstep or house mix during sunrise.</p>
<p>I was lucky to aquire her for $3,000. Including the $700 annual storage fee at the Art Car Support Ranch I have put over $6,500 into her in 5 years. Until last year all she needed was gas and away we went. </p>
<p>Historically, the FunkYeah! has cost the fuel to run her. For those of you that have contributed to expenses over the years it has been greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Last year proved to be a challenge for her and she had to be towed off the playa to the ranch where she lives. </p>
<p>Misty and I need your help if we are to bring her to the playa this year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contributions will go toward the following:</p>
<p><br/>1. Engine replacement/rebuild. $1500</p>
<p>2. New carberaetor $350-$500</p>
<p>3. transmission seal replacement $500</p>
<p>4. Exhaust manifold leak repair. (x2) $500</p>
<p>5. New Silver wrap for cage and speakers $100</p>
<p>6. New Lighting system $250</p>
<p>7. Storage fee $700</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we reach our goal the FUNK YEAH! will shine like the star that is FUNKY.  </p>
<p>We have some really cool <strong>perks</strong> for your contributions including our funky<strong> FUNK YEAH! sticker</strong>, the official <strong>FUNK YEAH sweatband and T-shirt</strong>. The <strong>FUNK YEAH 2GB Flash Drive</strong> with select FUNK YEAH playlists will keep you movin and a groovin'. Our Night out on playa wine and cheese funk rambles have become famous and we are offerring a lucky group a <strong>private tour</strong>!</p>
<p>If for some reason, we dont quite reach our goal know that your contribution will go to the repairs that need to be done in order to ensure she makes it to the playa!</p>

The FUNK YEAH! rolled onto the playa for her debut in 2008 and has brought the funk in so many ways over the years it makes me happy everytime I think about her. Bringing the funk from old school to new school while keeping it fresh has been the FUNK YEAH!'s mission from day 1. 
Our collection of FUNK music is a result of a lifetime of gathering rare grooves and old school collections. Our main collection is over 200 GB of music and it is quite an honor to bring it to BurningMan. Funk is such a necessary music form on the playa especially when it balances out the dubstep or house mix during sunrise.
I was lucky to aquire her for $3,000. Including the $700 annual storage fee at the Art Car Support Ranch I have put over $6,500 into her in 5 years. Until last year all she needed was gas and away we went. 
Historically, the FunkYeah! has cost the fuel to run her. For those of you that have contributed to expenses over the years it has been greatly appreciated.
Last year proved to be a challenge for her and she had to be towed off the playa to the ranch where she lives. 
Misty and I need your help if we are to bring her to the playa this year.
 
Your contributions will go toward the following:
1. Engine replacement/rebuild. $1500
2. New carberaetor $350-$500
3. transmission seal replacement $500
4. Exhaust manifold leak repair. (x2) $500
5. New Silver wrap for cage and speakers $100
6. New Lighting system $250
7. Storage fee $700
 
If we reach our goal the FUNK YEAH! will shine like the star that is FUNKY.  
We have some really cool perks for your contributions including our funky FUNK YEAH! sticker, the official FUNK YEAH sweatband and T-shirt. The FUNK YEAH 2GB Flash Drive with select FUNK YEAH playlists will keep you movin and a groovin'. Our Night out on playa wine and cheese funk rambles have become famous and we are offerring a lucky group a private tour!
If for some reason, we dont quite reach our goal know that your contribution will go to the repairs that need to be done in order to ensure she makes it to the playa!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Singing Bridges: UFO Bridge Sculpture Singing Bridges is an urban sonic sculpture on a global scale, making music with the sound of bridges. Placing contact microphones directly on the cables, I record and compose with the sound from inside the bridge, listening to the voice of the structure as wind, traffic and tension create vibrations. Listen to more cable-stay and suspension bridge sounds here


April 2012 is the tenth anniversary of my first trip to record stay-cabled bridges worldwide. I'm celebrating with a brand new work giving a sculptural dimension to this incredible archive of bridge recordings. The Singing Bridge Sculpture is the first in a series of bridge designs, interrelated compositions and visual works that transmit and pay tribute to the wonderful and unexpectedly rich world of bridge sounds. 
An elegant bridge silhouette, the Singing Bridge sculpture features a soundscape composed from bridge recordings, played through custom-built electronics by Andy Holtin. The bridge is produced in plexiglas or metal and the sound of the bridge plays through the object, as 'exciters' or contact speakers turn the bridge into a speaker. Below is the UFO Bridge design for the first prototype to be cut in steel blue, slate grey, gold or silver coloured plexiglas or anodised aluminium and wired for sound. 

Now is your chance to support Singing Bridges, own a design prototype or other cool stuff!

Why make a Singing Bridges Sculpture?
Investing the past ten years in Singing Bridges, I've played and recorded over 60 bridges worldwide. This has created wonderful opportunities to share my passion for these unique voices, working in collaboration with artists, musicians and engineers in each location in ephemeral & site-specific works. I'm truly excited about making this sculpture to transmit the rich and diverse sonic experience, share the magic and celebrate Singing Bridges through a visual and sonic design for bridge, music and art lovers. Your generous support will help create this extraordinary sonic bridge sculpture!

The Story So Far

Singing Bridges is a poetic, philosophical and creative work that helps 
transform our perception and experience of the world by tuning in to the
 intangible. Connecting people, places and cultures, bridges are always singing, all we need to do is stop 
and listen. 
More than the acoustic properties or harmonics in the wires, the sound is also the voice of the bridge, released through the vibration that travels along the cables and reaches out  across the globe. Imagine the voice of bridges all over the world singing together in an Acoustic Indra's Net.

More about the design and materials.

The first three Singing Bridge sculpture designs are based on my favourite UFO Bridge (Novy Most), Bratislava; Santiago Calatrava's Alamillo Bridge, Seville: and the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco. 
Dimensions 900mm x 350mm x 5mm, with the original series laser cut in coloured plexiglas.
A touch sensor controls the bridge sound with electronics custom-built by Andy Holtin. 
Later versions will be fabricated in anodised aluminium, and I am approaching a specialist audio company in Sweden to make the bridges sound even more incredible.

What are the Perks?

The perks are lots of fun: everyone who contributes will receive a thank you on the website and eternally singing bridges in gratitude + digital thank you postcard + invitation to send me a postcard of your favourite bridge with a story to be part of a future exhibition!
Depending on your chosen contribution: download of digital release specially composed bridge songs; a real postcard sent with a lipstick kiss from wherever I am & signed print of glamour bridge photoshoot; the first small scale 10cm to 15cm cut out of the bridges in plexiglas - these come in different colours depending on which perk you claim, a screen print of the Singing Bridge on alu-dibond; your own aluminium bridge cut-out from the studio of Andy Holtin; or a gorgeous Soviet Printing press graphic bridge poster.
Step up to the plate and enjoy a fabulous 4 course meal at Vin Aqua Vin in Berlin, with the artist & highly esteemed chef Jan Kreuzinger, or take the Golden Bridge that comes with a hug & kiss at the VIP Private View*, a gold plexiglas 15cm bridge sculpture, artist made screen print and eternal singing bridges...
The Diamond Bridge gives you the actual Singing Bridge sculpture prototype - or the Singing Bridge and Bridge of Dreams where I will come to the suitable bridge location nearest you and create a live sonic event!
The Live Sonic Event on a bridge near you will take place during 2012. The graphic bridge poster will be created in the springtime in Tallinn. All other perks will be delivered between 4-6 weeks (postcards, plexiglas bridges, screen print) or 8-12 weeks (composition, private view, prototype) after the campaign ends. A sneak peek at previous sonic bridge events in Paris, Maastricht, Ljubljana, Ghent & Glasgow...

*NB All Invitations to private view in Berlin/BCN/Istanbul/Tallinn - Travel & accommodation not included



How will you use the money? 
This campaign is focused on the sculpture in the context of the 10th Anniversary of Singing Bridges. The money will help towards materials, production and promotion of the Singing Bridges Sculptures. Your generous support covers the production costs, time to produce new bridge designs, compositions and launch events. 
In addition to the prototypes; we will make the screen printed image on aluminium-dibond, have 10cm and 15cm bridges cut in plexiglas, continue to design the sculpture series and create new compositions for each bridge, go to Tallinn to learn and create graphic bridges with the Soviet Printing Press. 
Once the prototype is made, I will continue working on the design and 
compositions for the limited edition of seven bridges, make recording trips to create live sonic bridge events with unsung bridges and take the next steps in planning the Global Bridge Symphony. I have ten years experience in creative project management and have successfully realised a diverse range of cultural events with an exceptional network and international team.All supporters will be updated with details of the bridge sculpture, events and releases. Even with only part of the funding goal, I can still finish the prototype sculpture, send postcards and hand made screen prints. Launch events will be held in Berlin, Barcelona and if someone selects the Bosphorous Bridge, Istanbul!

<h2><strong> The Little Cafe that Could ...</strong></h2>
<h3><em>There are landlords and then there are, landlords.</em></h3>
<p>Welcome to EOA, East of Adelaide, the “wrong side of the tracks” in London, Ontario. “You’re opening a café in the east end? You must be mad!” This was the refrain we often heard in the early days of East Village Coffeehouse.  “But we live here, it’s our neighbourhood.” we responded. </p>
<p>In the spring of 2008 we rented a long neglected space (with a hole leading to the basement, no plumbing, no electricity) with the purpose of revitalizing our stigmatized community while pushing the limits on how sustainable our local business could be.  (See our 10 Guiding Principles on the Updates Page.)  A poster on our front window says it all - “A safe space where human rights are protected”. An open, independent café that celebrates local arts, and offers affordable healthy fair trade goods is the best sign of a community turning a corner. However, not everyone shares this vision.</p>
<h3><strong>The Long Bill of the Law</strong></h3>
<p>Our struggle with our landlord started during our renovation, with the many stressful set-backs and delays (look at our add on pages for updates on the details – they must be cleared with our lawyer before we can publish them).  We started legal proceedings after our landlord attempted to seize our premises by marching in a bailiff for alleged non-payment of rent.  Our landlord had post-dated cheques for the entire year in his hands when he did this.  We have been struggling to defend our dream ever since.</p>
<p>Now --- four years and over $70,000 in legal fees later --- we are close to the final trial date of our law suit, Sept. 17.  Judging from our experience, our landlord’s strategy has been to delay, obstruct, and backtrack whenever possible.  This has jacked up the costs exponentially. But we have more at stake here than just money or the success of our business. We are fighting to improve the quality of life for folks at all income levels in our stigmatized neighbourhood.</p>
<p>We need your help to finish this and move on to our even bigger goal of starting a local, independent small business association.  Our immediate goal is to raise $15,000 to help us win this lawsuit and our deadline is our trial date --  September 17, 2012.</p>
<h3><strong>Together We CAN...</strong></h3>
<p>We feel it's a tremendous privilege to have enough, enough that we can give back. We are givers and we don't find it easy to ask for anything, even when we need help. But this issue is different because it's about the continued survival -- nay, success -- of our safe space project in EOA. Ironic really, given what we have had to bear in order to keep operating. And it's about these unjust ""David and Goliath"" situations that kill off local independent small businesses in neighborhoods all over North America. We could say so much more about that. And its about growing and healing our stigmatized community. We see that if you give groups of people a safe space to gather, the neighborhood will heal itself.</p>
<p>We've kept these doors open 7 days a week for 4 years because we believe that David can win. We think we can...we think we can...we think we can...</p>
<h3><strong>Beyond Our Goal</strong></h3>
<p>3% of your donations will go back into Indiegogo causes no matter how much we raise.</p>
<p>If we go over our goal, we will put that money toward the lawsuit if it still hasn’t been paid.  When it is paid, any extra money will be used to renovate and move into an alternative café space in EOA since we clearly cannot stay where we are.</p>
<p>We have plans to start LILA – Local Independent London Association – to help foster and build a local economy in London that is safe and supportive of small businesses. No more David and Goliath stories!</p>
<p>We have started to inquire about what we can do to change an abandoned lot, right on Dundas Street in the centre of EOA, into a community garden and park with a splash pad for the kids. One model we may pursue is that of a community land trust.</p>
<p>Linda will buy a new pair of shoes and Glenn will purchase more than one pair of socks.</p>
<h3><strong>Updates and Additional Info</strong></h3>
<p>If you care about what we're doing, we'll have plenty of updates where we answer people's questions publicly and give more info. For example, we can tell you more about our gluten-free menu, efforts to remain affordable to our street folk while fighting this legal battle, ecological start-up renovation, scheme to book local musicians and make sure they get paid, and many other facets of our project that we don't mention here.</p>

And its about growing and healing our stigmatized community. We see that if you give groups of people a safe space to gather, the neighborhood will heal itself.
We've kept these doors open 7 days a week for 4 years because we believe that David can win. We think we can...we think we can...we think we can...
Beyond Our Goal
3% of your donations will go back into Indiegogo causes no matter how much we raise.
If we go over our goal, we will put that money toward the lawsuit if it still hasn’t been paid.  When it is paid, any extra money will be used to renovate and move into an alternative café space in EOA since we clearly cannot stay where we are.
We have plans to start LILA – Local Independent London Association – to help foster and build a local economy in London that is safe and supportive of small businesses. No more David and Goliath stories!
We have started to inquire about what we can do to change an abandoned lot, right on Dundas Street in the centre of EOA, into a community garden and park with a splash pad for the kids. One model we may pursue is that of a community land trust.
Linda will buy a new pair of shoes and Glenn will purchase more than one pair of socks.
Updates and Additional Info
If you care about what we're doing, we'll have plenty of updates where we answer people's questions publicly and give more info. For example, we can tell you more about our gluten-free menu, efforts to remain affordable to our street folk while fighting this legal battle, ecological start-up renovation, scheme to book local musicians and make sure they get paid, and many other facets of our project that we don't mention here.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are an Edmonton based arts administration duo who have started a new arts based initiative called, CREATIVE PRACTICES INSTITUTE. Our two principals Connor &amp; Brittney have been working in Alberta’s arts community for the past five years. We have experience in municipal government, public art galleries, artist run centres and as freelance creatives. We are opening a new studio rental, exhibition and alternative learning space within a character house in downtown Edmonton. We aim to become a hub for creatives to network and collaborate while opening up more dialogue between the art world and all others in Edmonton. As a startup with a non-profit model we are ineligible for most public funding until we have been operating for a year, as a result - we really need your help! Funds raised in this campaign are earmarked for artists fees and opening receptions.</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We are asking for $1000 </p><p>These funds will go towards paying artists fees to those artists who exhibit at CPI.</p><p>In return for sponsoring this project we offer a range of perks based on the amount pledged. Please see the right side of the site for details about the different tiers available.</p><p>If we do not meet our entire goal all the funds raised will go towards artist fees.</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>It is very hard for emerging artists to make a living, many people ask artist to provide their services for free. By helping fund this project you are ensuring that at least seven artists will be paid for their time and energy. The opening reception serves as a networking and self promotion opportunity for our artists, they will have the chance to meet other artists, collectors, curators and other art professionals. As well there will be curatorial texts for each exhibition that the artist can utilize in their portfolio. We hope that our exhibitions will serve as a key stepping stone for our resident artists. Your contributions help to counter the stereotype of the starving artists. Help us show the local arts community of Edmonton that we value our young emerging artists!</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>We understand if you are unable to support this campaign financially. We appreciate you taking the time to read about us. If you have a spare minute please make use of the Indiegogo share tools and help CREATIVE PRACTICES reach a wider audience! Also we are on facebook and twitter - like us via the icon's below :) <p></p></div>","Short SummaryHi!

We have experience in municipal government, public art galleries, artist run centres and as freelance creatives. We are opening a new studio rental, exhibition and alternative learning space within a character house in downtown Edmonton. We aim to become a hub for creatives to network and collaborate while opening up more dialogue between the art world and all others in Edmonton. As a startup with a non-profit model we are ineligible for most public funding until we have been operating for a year, as a result - we really need your help! Funds raised in this campaign are earmarked for artists fees and opening receptions.What We Need & What You GetWe are asking for $1000 These funds will go towards paying artists fees to those artists who exhibit at CPI.In return for sponsoring this project we offer a range of perks based on the amount pledged. Please see the right side of the site for details about the different tiers available.If we do not meet our entire goal all the funds raised will go towards artist fees.The ImpactIt is very hard for emerging artists to make a living, many people ask artist to provide their services for free. By helping fund this project you are ensuring that at least seven artists will be paid for their time and energy. The opening reception serves as a networking and self promotion opportunity for our artists, they will have the chance to meet other artists, collectors, curators and other art professionals. As well there will be curatorial texts for each exhibition that the artist can utilize in their portfolio. We hope that our exhibitions will serve as a key stepping stone for our resident artists. Your contributions help to counter the stereotype of the starving artists. Help us show the local arts community of Edmonton that we value our young emerging artists!Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand if you are unable to support this campaign financially. We appreciate you taking the time to read about us. If you have a spare minute please make use of the Indiegogo share tools and help CREATIVE PRACTICES reach a wider audience!

<p>'Young, Broke And About To Become Homeless'; the reasons behind the #kissmeonelasttime #washableart campaign!</p>
<p>It was a rainy December evening. I was walking home from Birkbeck, the university in London where I studied Theatre and Drama. The Tories had just announced that grants for low-income students were being cut for good and the Arts Council of England had just experienced another blow to their funding and started to encourage artists to turn into a money-making, self-funding commercial profit makers. If there was a future, it was not looking bright and shiny.</p>
<p>I was in my final year working on my dissertation, had two part-time jobs and could barely make ends meet when my landlord left an eviction note outside my room.</p>
<p>The timing couldn't have been better; I had just had a lecture on Protesting, Politics and Theatricality. We discussed all the ways in which politics is being performed and structured for the media, marching is being restricted, and people get kettled in by police to create false headlines for the press. Of course, the cherry on top was that if you wanted to organise a protest you had to ask permission first.</p>
<p>I wanted to cry and scream at the same time but knew that it wouldn't get me anywhere. I was frustrated and angry, my blood was boiling, and I was furiously pacing around Euston. Could I speak up? Who would listen to me and what could I do to stop and improve this political and economic grey madness which seemed to lurk at every possible angle? What do you do when you have no control over your housing situation, theatres and community centres are closing down, and there is nothing you can do to stop gentrification and social cleansing because you are part of it?</p>
<p>And I wanted to shout; I wanted to speak up, protect what’s dear to me and to you, to everyday people. So I marched into The Lamb, the pub where I used to work part-time and said to the first person I saw, who happened to be my colleague, also an actor, Wuzza, 'how do you feel about making graffiti?' 'Graffiti?' ‘Yes! Washable graffiti, a political message across London, interacting with the city. Places are being forced to close down because they can't afford to pay new, increased rent, people are being relocated from one side of London to the other, social cleansing and gentrification is destroying London as we know it, and it’s happening at lightning speed! Shall we celebrate what we have before it’s gone forever? It might be messy and we might get into trouble.' Without hesitation, he said ‘Let’s do this. When, now?’ ‘Yes, now.'</p>
<p>And that’s how the idea of washable art was born. Our performance will be documented and showcased as a sweet remembrance of times we had.</p>
<p>Lots of love,<br/>Elina and Wuzza</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In the fourth issue of UQ we want to analyse various concepts relating to intimacy. Through discussions and sharing of interests, we quickly discovered that we all have a preoccupation with reading diaries, letters, interviews and poetry that revolve around the personal and emotional text. With this issue we want to create a space that explores how private content can be presented for mass audience and in turn what happens to that content once it is available to the public realm. </p>
<p><strong>Our goal </strong>is to create a publication that is focused, accessible, engaging and visually stimulating. The publication aims to be personal and collective; it is as much about creating ongoing relationships and conversations, as it is about the collaborative interpretation of intimacy.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471350065/jrqn4qkc1etxvva4eep4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the openness of digital culture, we share our personal lives on public platforms, which results in a shift in the way we are intimate with thoughts, people and objects. We started by researching the questions: <i>what is intimacy? and what can intimacy mean today?</i> We discovered that it can be experienced emotionally, physically, intellectually, spiritually, individually, collectively and beyond. As intimacy is such an abstract and subjective concept, we want to open up the term to different interpretations.</p>
<p>Challenging the conventions of a publication, there will not only be a compilation of creative works inspired by intimacy and its interpretations from a range of contributors but also a day-long event. The production of the text and its content will have equal weight in our publication. The act of choosing and reframing is a story in itself. This opening up to interpretation provides opportunities for internal contributions from the team and external commissions from artists, writers and practitioners.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What Your Support Means</h3>
<p><strong>Your funding</strong> will be for commissioning texts and images for the publication and gratuity for invited collaborators which include artists, practitioners, and poets from various fields. They will share their perspectives by leading readings, workshops, and talks to generate new possibilities when thinking about and experiencing intimacy today. The event will take place on 4 September and will be open for the public to participate.</p>
<p>Funding needed:</p>
<ul><li>We aim to provide honorarium to commissioned writers, poets, artists and event collaborators</li></ul>
</div><div>
<p>The project is based on intensive collaboration and group work. As aspiring curators, writers, and designers, we are using this publication to reflect on our own development. It is an opportunity to work on skills and practices that are important to us, and also ones we haven't yet encountered.

</div></div>","Short Summary
In the fourth issue of UQ we want to analyse various concepts relating to intimacy. Through discussions and sharing of interests, we quickly discovered that we all have a preoccupation with reading diaries, letters, interviews and poetry that revolve around the personal and emotional text. With this issue we want to create a space that explores how private content can be presented for mass audience and in turn what happens to that content once it is available to the public realm. 
Our goal is to create a publication that is focused, accessible, engaging and visually stimulating. The publication aims to be personal and collective; it is as much about creating ongoing relationships and conversations, as it is about the collaborative interpretation of intimacy.


The Impact
In the openness of digital culture, we share our personal lives on public platforms, which results in a shift in the way we are intimate with thoughts, people and objects. We started by researching the questions: what is intimacy? and what can intimacy mean today? We discovered that it can be experienced emotionally, physically, intellectually, spiritually, individually, collectively and beyond. As intimacy is such an abstract and subjective concept, we want to open up the term to different interpretations.
Challenging the conventions of a publication, there will not only be a compilation of creative works inspired by intimacy and its interpretations from a range of contributors but also a day-long event. The production of the text and its content will have equal weight in our publication. The act of choosing and reframing is a story in itself. This opening up to interpretation provides opportunities for internal contributions from the team and external commissions from artists, writers and practitioners.
What We Need & What Your Support Means
Your funding will be for commissioning texts and images for the publication and gratuity for invited collaborators which include artists, practitioners, and poets from various fields. They will share their perspectives by leading readings, workshops, and talks to generate new possibilities when thinking about and experiencing intimacy today. The event will take place on 4 September and will be open for the public to participate.
Funding needed:
We aim to provide honorarium to commissioned writers, poets, artists and event collaborators

The project is based on intensive collaboration and group work. As aspiring curators, writers, and designers, we are using this publication to reflect on our own development. It is an opportunity to work on skills and practices that are important to us, and also ones we haven't yet encountered. As a funder, you are providing support to a group of students interested in critically reflecting upon practices when generating and presenting creative and cultural knowledge.

People could customize those Greymen during the week, and at the end of the event burn their own inner Greyman during 140 private rituals.In 2008 we protected the border between Dreams and Reality with the Department of Dreamland Security at Checkpoint Dreamyourtopia - a border control checkpoint to enter your own Dreams. A year later we tore down the walls between Dreams and Reality in an old swimming pool in Berlin with chainsaws and sledgehammers, exactly twenty years after the Berlin Wall fell.In 2011 people could sign a Spiritual Karma Laundering contract at the Exchanghibition Bank. That would bring their spiritual Karma debt back to Zero, and in return they'd get a Zero banknote.In 2012 the Exchanghibition Banknotes were hanging as leaves from the branches of the Transformoney Tree. People could draw and paint on real banknotes, turning their Money into Art, and then glue those banknotes onto the tree.In 2013 we guided people on their Spiritual Path to Enlikement with Like4Real. EpilogueReality still has more pixels than the screen of your iPhone.

We all need to come together and start a movement against hate, bullying, and help end teen suicide. The rate of death is higher now then its ever been. Not all people who hurt look sad.

<p> </p>
<p>Last year we were in the Dallas pride parade. I held a small sign that simply said ""it's ok to be different""  because it is ok and people need to know its ok. Thousands of people saw that sign and told me, ""Thank you"". It touched their hearts. It was raining that day, yet thousands came out to show support anyway. It didn't stop anyone. I didn't have an umbrella and a lady I had never seen came up to me and gave me hers. At one point prior to the parade beginning, I was holding my sign and a little girl about 4 or 5 years old came running up to me with her parents chasing behind her. She ran up and said ""I love you"" and gave me a huge hug. Right then I knew how it felt to be accepted. This little girl did not know me and told me she loved me. I want to share that love. Last week I thought to myself, ""What if I get a group together to march in the parade with us and carry a huge banner saying 'It's OK 2B Different' and 'More love. Less hate.', and then everyone have a sign that says something that they want the world to - know something from the heart - but I can't afford to do it on my own so I'm asking for help.</p>

<p>The entry fee is $300 and it's another $150 to throw beads and then the cost of the large banner for the front.

<p>I have created 50 quilts and I am going to create an exhibition of them February 18th of next year so I can share it with you and the world. </p>
<div>This is the latest and my greatest example of what I am learning and creating. <p></p>
<p>I want to share with you the ways that a medium can transform past our preconceptions. I have learned SO much in creating these 50 quilts. I want to bring that to you. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The reason I am doing this show is to create a series of works that visually explains the space between function and art and pushes the medium of ""quilt"" out of the realm of being relegated to the ""domestic"" and the [untrue] thoughts that they are monetarily valueless. <p></p>
<p>Quilts are important. Our global experience of textiles is important. I want to create an exhibition where that is the singular experience. </p>
<p>The artist Donald Judd, for whom the title takes its name, is a sculptor who's works are entirely about materials in environment. I chose to allude to his oeuvre with this series to illustrate the simple yet paramount task of this show: to take the focus of the viewing audience to the basic elements of a quilt. </p>
<p>The defining elements of this show are as follows:</p>
<p>The ""Log cabin"" block is arguably the most basic repeatable quilt-block unit so by using it I am working with the basic alphabet of patchwork. </p>
<p>I am also relegated to only black and white fabric after the red of the centers, which makes the pieces studies in graphic form and iteration rather than in colors and those relationships. </p>
<p>The quilting on each follows the same rules so that it doesn't add any variation to the already varied explorations in changes within the blocks and the orientation. </p>
<p>They are each the same size 90"" square</p>
<p>all the materials are reclaimed discarded textiles. </p>
<p>I have chosen materials and form and shape that are the most palatable to the viewer and to the concepts of the medium thereby allowing them to explore the intricacies of the  textures of the materials and the variation within each piece. </p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>I am funding this whole show myself. <p></p>
<p>I have used over a ton of materials in the construction of these 50 quilts. Over 2000 pounds of textiles saved from scraps or landfills as well 2000 pounds of textures with existing stories and histories from their usages. </p>
<p>There is a great deal of expense in creating these projects. </p>

<h3>My name is Monika Stockton Maddux</h3>
<p>I am a 3rd year Master of Fine Arts Candidate at Wichita State University. I have lived in Wichita, Kansas my entire life and plan to open a business in Wichita upon completion of my MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Artist Statement:</strong></p>
<p>A recurring theme is my obsession. I have been unable to conceive and deliver a baby girl and a profound obsession has developed and festered.  Because my family is such an important part of my life, it is natural that it is the inspiration from which I draw, and this is reflected in my work. I am a mother to four boys and have no daughters. My work mirrors intense and deep emotions, it is from these emotions that I pull, and therefore enable, an emotion from the viewer; the type of emotion which is felt instinctively; that becomes visceral yet cognitively unattainable.</p>
<p>My content is uncomfortable and relatable. Focused on portraying the emotions conjured through reenactment and visual conversation, I begin with the seemingly mundane, and upon further investigation, end with overwhelming obsessiveness. This work is a progression that creates an environment where the viewer is confronted with passion and compulsion sparked by loss.</p>
<p>I transform the viewer’s perception of their size and place, in their environment, to position them into what entering my mind would be like. An encounter within the emotionally disturbed consciousness of a mother who has lost and is obsessed with these notions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Exhibition Proposal:</strong></p>
<p>In my last year as candidate, I intend to explore other avenues of making while maintaining the same narratives; motherhood, loss caused by miscarriage, obsession and its manifestations, desperation, dealing with resolution and hard adoptions of reality. I will continue to use textiles, ready-made objects from my childhood, furniture and building materials with my thesis exhibition consisting of 8 - 10 sculptures as a continuous body of work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Research Concept:</strong></p>
<p>My research is into the multiple aspects of motherhood, being a mother and having a mother. Being raised with sisters and raising only sons. Being a mother losing a daughter and being a daughter losing a mother. I continue to investigate obsession that develops in response to the psychological impact of loss, specifically the effects of miscarriage. To that I add an investigation about the desire to become like my mother and the inability to do the same mother/daughter things I had anticipated and the idea developing into an obsession.</p>
<p>I am curious about my need to produce a female offspring. I wonder if it stems from a maternal need, or if it is ingrained in me by society. I was either naturally predisposed to nurture or I was trained, beginning when I received my first doll that I named, cared for, and pretended was my own child. My mother had 3 daughters and she made matching dresses for them and I couldn’t wait until I had a daughter to wear my handmade dresses. Do I want to be like my mother or am I expected to be like my mother?</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Gates of O’brillin is Brenda Konitzer &amp; Jai Atkinson, aka Miss Brenda &amp; Lady Jai. They are Gothic Steampunk artists who focus on upcycling, creating boxes, cameo jewelry, home decor &amp; more. They bring in elements of fantasy and sci-fi, including homages to favorite books &amp; shows. They are heavily influenced by the Victorian era writers including, Poe, Verne, Stoker, Shelly and Wells.</p>
<p>Gates of O’brillin started with Miss Brenda full time trying to fulfill a long time dream. Lady Jai started part time &amp; recently took the leap to full time by leaving her long time position as a social worker. Besides art markets &amp; Etsy, they travel the southeast sharing their art at comic cons. Each year they try to expand &amp; in 2018 they will be traveling to events in New Orleans, &amp; Madison, WI. That is where you come in!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our Short range goal is $5000. Here's what that will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Convention fees.</strong> We did 12 events in 2017, 8 of them were out of state. We paid $2400 in fees for space. In 2018 and 2019, we plan to do even more events farther out, starting with New Orleans. We are also hitting Madison, WI in September. We've found that the exposure of a corner booth increases our sales by huge amounts. Unfortunately, it also increases our con fees. Our most profitable event last year was in Raleigh &amp; the corner fee was $550 with a convenience fee of $50 when you pay for space.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hotel costs.</strong> All of those out of town events require a place to stay, both during the event &amp; for the long distance ones, while traveling. We stay at the con hotel when possible, for a variety of reasons, including networking and convenience. They tend to be Marriott or Hilton based, so we accumulate points that can lead to free rooms or food, which is a big help. </li>
<li>
<strong>Travel Expenses.</strong> Gas, food, parking and van maintenance all add up quickly.</li>
<li>
<strong>The little things.</strong> Or the not so little things that come up, like the $100 vendor license for Nashville &amp; the $142 insurance fee for a 6x2 foot table in Orlando.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We started this journey together &amp; want to include you every step of the way. We've come up with some great perks if you help us.</p>
<ul>
<li>$25 gets you right into the Adventure! A signed print of our travelers, Katie &amp; Nathaniel, plus an invitation into their online story where you are the star.</li>
<li>$50 will give you Zombified book 1, signed by Santiago Cirilo, our favorite Walker.</li>
<li>$250 is an ultimate package with cameo jewelry &amp; a matching box, all hand painted by the lovely Lady Jai &amp; Miss Brenda.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the other perks. You can find something for however much you have to give.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We chose Indiegogo for a very important reason, Flexible Funding. That means, if for some weird reason we don't make our goal, all hope is not lost. What you donate still comes to us (minus some handling fees of course) which means you will still get your perks no matter what! Plus, everything that is raised will help in some way. Whether it gets us to one con or 20, it is a huge burden off of us and will help us stay creative &amp; able to keep bringing our great work to you.</p>
<p>This also means that if we exceed our goal, we can go further. More cons, more states &amp; more advertising, so everyone can see what we do &amp; we can meet even more great people, like you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>People often say, ""life happens"" &amp; the same is true in business. Over the years we've had medical emergencies, vehicle problems, &amp; other unexpected occurrences. Things are bound to happen again. The key is how we react to them. We keep going.</p>
<p>A few years ago, my mom was in ICU and Jai was recovering from a major surgery, so I did an out of town event alone. We adapt and aren't afraid to rethink things. Flexibility is the key.</p>
<p>Minor things, like not getting the layout you expected, happen often. We work with what we have &amp; make it work to our advantage. That is what we will continue to do. Things may not happen 100% as planned &amp; that's okay, we will find a way to make it work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to funding our campaign, you can help in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the campaign</li>
<li>Share our posts (even if we're not your style, your friends may be interested)</li>
<li>Moral support is always appreciated. We are taking a chance, so it's always nice to feel the love.</li>

Lady Jai started part time & recently took the leap to full time by leaving her long time position as a social worker. Besides art markets & Etsy, they travel the southeast sharing their art at comic cons. Each year they try to expand & in 2018 they will be traveling to events in New Orleans, & Madison, WI. That is where you come in!

What We Need & What You Get
Our Short range goal is $5000. Here's what that will go towards:


Convention fees. We did 12 events in 2017, 8 of them were out of state. We paid $2400 in fees for space. In 2018 and 2019, we plan to do even more events farther out, starting with New Orleans. We are also hitting Madison, WI in September. We've found that the exposure of a corner booth increases our sales by huge amounts. Unfortunately, it also increases our con fees. Our most profitable event last year was in Raleigh & the corner fee was $550 with a convenience fee of $50 when you pay for space.

Hotel costs. All of those out of town events require a place to stay, both during the event & for the long distance ones, while traveling. We stay at the con hotel when possible, for a variety of reasons, including networking and convenience. They tend to be Marriott or Hilton based, so we accumulate points that can lead to free rooms or food, which is a big help. 

Travel Expenses. Gas, food, parking and van maintenance all add up quickly.

The little things. Or the not so little things that come up, like the $100 vendor license for Nashville & the $142 insurance fee for a 6x2 foot table in Orlando.

 
We started this journey together & want to include you every step of the way. We've come up with some great perks if you help us.

$25 gets you right into the Adventure! A signed print of our travelers, Katie & Nathaniel, plus an invitation into their online story where you are the star.
$50 will give you Zombified book 1, signed by Santiago Cirilo, our favorite Walker.
$250 is an ultimate package with cameo jewelry & a matching box, all hand painted by the lovely Lady Jai & Miss Brenda.

Check out the other perks. You can find something for however much you have to give.
 
We chose Indiegogo for a very important reason, Flexible Funding. That means, if for some weird reason we don't make our goal, all hope is not lost. What you donate still comes to us (minus some handling fees of course) which means you will still get your perks no matter what! Plus, everything that is raised will help in some way. Whether it gets us to one con or 20, it is a huge burden off of us and will help us stay creative & able to keep bringing our great work to you.
This also means that if we exceed our goal, we can go further. More cons, more states & more advertising, so everyone can see what we do & we can meet even more great people, like you!

Risks & Challenges
People often say, ""life happens"" & the same is true in business. Over the years we've had medical emergencies, vehicle problems, & other unexpected occurrences. Things are bound to happen again. The key is how we react to them. We keep going.
A few years ago, my mom was in ICU and Jai was recovering from a major surgery, so I did an out of town event alone. We adapt and aren't afraid to rethink things. Flexibility is the key.
Minor things, like not getting the layout you expected, happen often. We work with what we have & make it work to our advantage. That is what we will continue to do. Things may not happen 100% as planned & that's okay, we will find a way to make it work.
