</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Wily West Productions is an
award-winning Bay Area Theatre company devoted to presenting world premiere
plays by local playwrights.   We are scrappy, nimble, innovative, and
entirely dependent on private funding and the efforts of our team.  Creating,
maintaining, and sustaining an independent theatre company is hard work!  And
it’s risky! Like going to Mars. Or staying alive on Earth.  <br/>
<br/>
With your help, there may be hope for humanity (and independent theater) yet!</p>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What We Need</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Rather than just do a series of staged readings we actually want
to fully stage these plays!  We are working with up-and-coming Director
Ariel Craft (Co-Artistic Director of Bread Box Theatre Company) to create a
fully realized production at the Exit Theatre in San Francisco!    </p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">HOW YOUR CONTRIBUTION CAN HELP</b><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Your support is crucial.   Even a small
contribution will make a big difference for this campaign.  You will be
supporting over 20 local artists with this ONE project.  If we reach goal
we will be able to  present our two summer shows in full color and also
add an additional week of staged readings which could lead into Wily West
presenting shows in 2016.  </p>
<p>All funds will go to the essentials:
 </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Rehearsal
Space</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Costumes - we
need space suits!</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Sets -
materials for our set!</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Venue Rent -
we will be able to run more than 3 weeks!</p>

to buy over-priced tickets from scalpers when you can secure your seats now?</p>
<p><b>MORE ABOUT WILY WEST</b></p>
<p>Wily West Productions formed in 2008 to provide a locally
run, locally cast, locally produced outlet for new plays by Bay Area
playwrights.  The production team members have a combined background
totaling several dozen productions of various sizes and budgets from New York
to Salt Lake City and San Francisco.  Wily West is now in its sixth
full season and has produced critically acclaimed and award-winning
productions. We value not only quality production elements, but strive for
a creative and fun production environment. </p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">That we received any recognition, given our small budget, is a
testament to the excellent work of our team.  So donating funds to Wily West

<h3>You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help us meet our
goal.  No donation is too small.  Everything helps!  </p>
<p>For those among you
who have never attended one of our shows, this is your golden opportunity.
Attend an exciting, new theatrical production. And maybe even assuage some
guilt. (And guilt is bad.) You can be a true patron of the arts for
artists that actually live and work in San Francisco. And who hasn't secretly
imagined him or herself a Lorenzo de' Medici or a Queen Elizabeth I?</p>

What We Need



Rather than just do a series of staged readings we actually want
to fully stage these plays!  We are working with up-and-coming Director
Ariel Craft (Co-Artistic Director of Bread Box Theatre Company) to create a
fully realized production at the Exit Theatre in San Francisco!    
HOW YOUR CONTRIBUTION CAN HELP


Your support is crucial.   Even a small
contribution will make a big difference for this campaign.  You will be
supporting over 20 local artists with this ONE project.  If we reach goal
we will be able to  present our two summer shows in full color and also
add an additional week of staged readings which could lead into Wily West
presenting shows in 2016.  
All funds will go to the essentials:
 
· 
Rehearsal
Space
· 
Costumes - we
need space suits!
· 
Sets -
materials for our set!
· 
Venue Rent -
we will be able to run more than 3 weeks!
· 
Artist/writer
stipends


CONTRIBUTIONS OF $40 COME WITH TICKETS!
Seating to Mars is limited.   Why wait in line or be forced
to buy over-priced tickets from scalpers when you can secure your seats now?
MORE ABOUT WILY WEST
Wily West Productions formed in 2008 to provide a locally
run, locally cast, locally produced outlet for new plays by Bay Area
playwrights.  The production team members have a combined background
totaling several dozen productions of various sizes and budgets from New York
to Salt Lake City and San Francisco.  Wily West is now in its sixth
full season and has produced critically acclaimed and award-winning
productions. We value not only quality production elements, but strive for
a creative and fun production environment. 
AWARDS AND HONORS:
2010 Listed as one of the ""Top 10 Productions of 2010""
by SF BAY TIMES
2013 Bay Area Theatre Critics Circle Award for Best Original
Script 
2013 Bay Area Theatre Critics Circle Award Nomination for Best
Featured Actor
2014 Theatre Bay Area Award for Outstanding World Premiere
2014 Theatre Bay Area Award for Outstanding Featured Female Actor
and TWO shows were nominated for the 2014 Theatre Bay Area Award
for Outstanding Anthology
That we received any recognition, given our small budget, is a
testament to the excellent work of our team.  So donating funds to Wily West
means you are giving to an under dog...but the dog has talent!
You Can Help
Help us meet our
goal.  No donation is too small.  Everything helps!  
For those among you
who have never attended one of our shows, this is your golden opportunity.
Attend an exciting, new theatrical production. And maybe even assuage some
guilt. (And guilt is bad.) You can be a true patron of the arts for
artists that actually live and work in San Francisco. And who hasn't secretly
imagined him or herself a Lorenzo de' Medici or a Queen Elizabeth I?",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<br/><p>I was born at Secret Heart Medical Center at 12:53 am on December 5, 2000. I was 3 months early and 2 pounds. I was barely alive, but after two months in the hospital, I was brought home on the day of love February 14, 2001. My full name is Alaja Oni Le’alla Badalich, which means Understanding, Strength, and Adoration. I was a strong baby and considered a miracle baby. For being born so early I have athsma but that never gets in the way of anything. I’m from Eugene, OR. I attend Roosevelt middle school and I am a straight A student.</p>
<p>My family is also a big part of my life. I live with my mom, step-Dad, and my little half-brother. My grandparents also live in Eugene too, while my cousins and aunts all live in California. I love my family so much, they give so much support to me, and without them I am sure that I wouldn't be who I am today. I also love my friends, they are always lending a helping hand, and I can always count on them.</p>
<p>I’am a dancer! I dance to express not to impress. When I dance everything fades away in my life that is bothering me even if its dance stressing me out. I like to say that dance is my “escape.” Each movement, even if its just a turn, a balance, a pointed foot, A pile, or even one hand guiding your body through its movement, that little rise, ronde de jambe, any movement you think is small is really big. Because if you didn't have the small movements we wouldn't make the big ones so beautiful. Each moment of the movement gets me closer to finding myself, finding who I am on the inside. We are all different thats what makes us unique. I think if I didn’t dance I wouldn't be unique. </p>

We can't wait.  What We Need & How We’ll Say “Thank You”The $6,500 we need to raise will go directly into the production of Lolly Willowes. Your contribution will go toward:
Venue rental cost
Set design and costumes
Marketing and PR: ads, flyers, radio segments
And last but not least, remuneration for our incredible cast and crew, who are working for minimal rates to make this project happen
GOOD NEWS: thanks to our fiscal sponsorship by the distinguished Artaria String Quartet, all contributions to Lolly Willowes are tax-deductible non-profit donations.  Take a look at the right side of the page for some donation levels and associated perks! Or click ""Back It"" to enter any amount you choose.  The ImpactLolly Willowes is a dream come true: new music has become the ground on which a community of artists can do what they love to do, do what they do best, an opportunity for them to take their skills and their insights into unprecedented regions of technical and spiritual inquiry, giving their gifts not only to theater audiences, but to the larger and needful Houston community, which is still in the process of recovery from Hurricane Harvey.  On March 3, the Lolly Willowes cast is producing a Hurricane Harvey recovery and community engagement event in Houston’s Independence Heights neighborhood with our partner Rebuilding Together Houston, a disaster relief non-profit whose home rebuilding efforts have been focused on devastation in Independence Heights. The TeamMichael Alec Rose, composer and librettistDashiell Waterbury, directorChelsea Helm, sopranoBen Edquist, baritoneRaphaella Medina, mezzo-sopranoMatt Lammers, violinChandler Yu, violinNatasha Galitzine, violaMinzo Kim, celloA.J.

This funding assists with performance conceptualization, preparation, and actualization. 

 




The work traveling across the atlantic is PUNCTUATE. PUNCTUATE is the reading of a poem that directs a performance with its embedded punctuation marks.

<p><b>Résumé du spectacle</b></p>
<p><i>Lorsqu’un événement tragique vient secouer l’équilibre fragile de sa vie, Thomas s’en prend à sa mère, lui reprochant jusqu’à l’amour qu’elle lui a prodigué. Un blâme de trop dans la vie de Danielle, qui n’a plus d’autre choix que de dévoiler à son fils les secrets d’un passé familial restés trop longtemps enfouis. Thomas s’engage alors dans une guerre d’honneur dont il souhaite sortir vainqueur, portant l’histoire de sa mère comme sa propre croix. Sur le champ de bataille, six êtres en quête d’amour assisteront à l’éclatement de la vérité sous le regard d’un jeune homme qui a tout à gagner. Mais les règles du jeu sont cruelles, car au pays des têtes baissées, c’est la loi du plus fort.</i></p>

Résumé du spectacle
Lorsqu’un événement tragique vient secouer l’équilibre fragile de sa vie, Thomas s’en prend à sa mère, lui reprochant jusqu’à l’amour qu’elle lui a prodigué. Un blâme de trop dans la vie de Danielle, qui n’a plus d’autre choix que de dévoiler à son fils les secrets d’un passé familial restés trop longtemps enfouis. Thomas s’engage alors dans une guerre d’honneur dont il souhaite sortir vainqueur, portant l’histoire de sa mère comme sa propre croix. Sur le champ de bataille, six êtres en quête d’amour assisteront à l’éclatement de la vérité sous le regard d’un jeune homme qui a tout à gagner. Mais les règles du jeu sont cruelles, car au pays des têtes baissées, c’est la loi du plus fort.

</div></div>","Help us to play a role in putting some imagination back into education.
 We are facing a crisis as this is under threat.
Creativity is being squeezed out of schools across the UK. As a country we seem to have lost sight of its importance during those vital, formative years.
But what does this mean for future generations?

We expect many things from schools; we want our children to gain all sorts of skills. Amongst these, we want to see them listening with understanding, learning to work with others and experiencing what it means to take the lead. We hope they will learn to look, think and have ideas and, then, be confident about expressing those ideas. Taking part in cultural activities gives children the chance to develop and practice these skills. 
But with these experiences being increasingly rationed how will the challenges of an increasingly complex world be met?   


Who will be doing the creative thinking, the collaborating and communicating in the future?



If we are going to develop the next generation of politicians, scientists, entrepreneurs, artists… who will discover, imagine and lead, then it is imperative for creativity to thrive.
In a bid to combat the squeezing out of the creative spirit in schools, Into Opera has created a unique Education Project which will immerse children in an exciting cultural experience and encourage creativity and imagination across the whole curriculum.
Our creative team running a workshop with 11-year-olds to develop A King's Ransom (Norwich, 2012).
Help us play a role in securing the UK as a creative nation
Into Opera's project can make an impact. It will bring 200 children, from 4 schools, from different social backgrounds together. 200 children will be offered a truly unique experience. Integrating, collaborating and working side by side, these children will stage a brand new opera. They will work with a composer, a librettist and a range of professional artists to explore this all encompassing art form and discover how a production develops from its inception through to a full-scale production. Into Opera will work closely with teachers. In fact, the aim is for teachers, parents and children of all four schools to come together with this opera at its core.  
Into Opera hopes to demonstrate the numerous ways in which cultural activity can really encourage the creative imagination across the whole curriculum. All children deserve a high quality cultural education. The multifaceted nature of opera can inspire and empower children; it can help them become what UNESCO calls an 'all round complete person’.
A King's Ransom
Into Opera has teamed up with the acclaimed British Classical Composer, Patrick Hawes. The project is focussed upon working with children aged 7-11 to stage the Professional World Premiere of Patrick’s children’s opera, A King’s Ransom.
The opera offers an unusual twist on the well-known story of Robin Hood. It explores what happens when Robin is unable to save the day, and instead, the community must look within itself for answers to its problems.
A King’s Ransom was originally written in 1994. Now, 21 years later, Patrick and  brother Andy, the opera's librettist, are returning to this work with fresh eyes and collaborating with Into Opera to revise and expand the work. The characters in the opera clearly split into four chorus sections: the villagers, soldiers, bagmen and masons. Each of these chorus sections will be performed by an individual school.

A King's Ransom's creative team : Stage Director: Genevieve Raghu, Musical Director: Benjamin Hamilton, Composer: Patrick Hawes, Librettist: Andrew Hawes   (Norfolk, 2015). 
This is a wonderful opportunity for children to work closely with professional artists to develop, nurture and build skills in creativity and self-confidence.
Into Opera will also provide teachers with resources and workshops aimed at embedding creativity into the whole curriculum.
A King’s Ransom is the core of our education project and will enable us to carry out our mission: to put creativity at the pulse of education.
Into Opera has formed a partnership with the Prince's Foundation for Children and the Arts, a charity which helps disadvantaged children across the UK to become involved with the arts. With the support of the Prince’s Foundation, Into Opera plans to develop the project beyond the premiere of A King’s Ransom so that it becomes a national education project, reaching schools in need of it most.
At a time when school subjects engendering creativity and imagination seem to be valued less and less, Into Opera and Children and the Arts will endeavour to put some of the creative spirit back.
How Can You Help?
Into Opera's goal of raising £10,000 goal will help to secure major components of this project as shown below. 



1st Funding Goal: £5000. This will pay for each child to work with a professional designer to design and create their costume. For each child, this will cost £25.   










2nd Funding Goal: £2,200. This will pay for a professional 11 piece orchestra to perform alongside the children at the premiere. So, one individual donation of £200 will pay for one orchestral instrument!






3rd Funding Goal: £2,800. This will ensure we can pay the initial costs to secure a premiere class venue to stage A King's Ransom. We would love to give children the opportunity to perform and experience the inner workings of a professional theatre.



Your support counts. By actively helping us to raise £10,000 for some key components of this project, you will also help us to build a compelling case to present to the Arts Council in order to gain the remaining £65,000 required to bring this project to life. With your support, we can convince them that this is not a project to be dismissed.
Help us prove to the Arts Council that an investment in A King’s Ransom is an investment worth making.
The money applied for will be used to cover payment for the artists'  time, the educational resources for schools (Key Stage 2 Curriculum activity packs, learning aids for the music and vocal scores), the props and set, a workshop with the orchestra, rehearsal time at the venue and Into Opera's administration costs.
Who Are We?



Our company was founded by two good friends and colleagues, Genevieve Raghu and Benjamin Hamilton. They met at the University of Warwick in 2008 and quickly developed a shared passion for the way in which opera could touch people’s lives. Genevieve and Ben launched a tour of Henry Purcell's ‘Dido and Aeneas’ across the West Midlands and brought it to Covent Garden, London. Later, the pair staged a striking production of 'The Threepenny Opera' at Warwick Arts Centre.

Opera empowered those children and unlocked their imaginations. Our co-founders have continued working extensively in the arts across the UK and in other parts of Europe.
Now, Genevieve and Ben have united to make something special happen. 



Our aim: get more people Into Opera! 



How will we do it: Into Opera will stage new, bold opera productions integrated with imaginative education projects, starting with the children’s opera, A King’s Ransom.

</p>
<p><b>you &amp; i Theatre<i> </i></b>is run by Co-Artistic Directors Kevin
Kraussler and Ming Hudson.  Our mandate is to create works of devised physical
theatre that promote social change.</p>
<p>We are so excited to finally be bringing <b><i>The
Air Loom</i></b> to the stage this year! </p>
<p>We will have our world premiere performance
at the Edmonton International Fringe Festival in August 2016 (the largest
Fringe Theatre Festival in North America) and then tour our production to the
Vancouver International Fringe Festival in September. </p>
<p>This project has been a passion for
co-creators Ming Hudson and Kevin Kraussler since 2012. They have held various
development workshops and enlisted the dramaturgical assistance of Jan
Derbyshire and Jack Paterson to assist them in discovering this new play. Yoshié Bancroft is the latest co-creator to join forces with <b>you &amp; i Theatre</b> to direct <b><i>The Air Loom</i></b>. Costumes and graphic design for this
production have been created by Keira Daniels.</p>
<p><b><i>The</i> <i>Air</i> <i>Loom</i></b> has two parallel intersecting
storylines.  The first takes place in 18<sup>th</sup> Century London and follows the real-life story of James
Tilly Matthews, the first person to be diagnosed with schizophrenia. Matthews
believed himself to be antagonized by a gang of strange characters whom he
claimed had influence over his thoughts through the use of a loom made of air. The second story takes place in present day British Columbia, and centers around a young child whose parent is experiencing delusional behavior for the first time, and their subsequent diagnosis with schizophrenia.  Just as Matthews had experienced hundreds of years earlier, the parent too believes themselves to be stalked by mysterious strangers, the difference being that they are certain these villains are electronically monitoring and invading their home.  This aspect of the play draws on Kraussler’s personal experience growing up in a household with a schizophrenic family member. These two seemingly separate stories are linked by the Air Loom Gang, a
terrifying and complex group of mercenaries who exist outside of time.  They target both the parent and Matthews, altering
their victims’ behaviour with the symptoms of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>There is currently a stigma around issues concerning mental
wellness in Canada even though roughly 1 in every 4 people will be diagnosed
with some form of mental health issue within their lifetime.
 Approximately 1 in every 100 people are schizophrenic.  For this
community, and for the people who love them, it is important to tell the stories of those afflicted by schizophrenia in order to open up a dialogue about the condition,
and to reduce the stigma that interferes with integration and acceptance of
those with this illness.  </p>

</ul><br/></div>","The New England New Play Anthology is designed to show the rest of the world some of our most exciting New England playwrights and their plays. We are partnering with Smith & Kraus to publish the anthology.  They will do a 2,000 copy paperback print run, distributed nationally by them and on their web site, and it will also be an ebook.  We have already solicited scripts from New England theater companies and we have a selection committee in place who are working on selecting the plays to be published.  The Anthology will contain between 4 - 6 new full-length plays written by New England playwrights, as well as a handful of short plays. Each of the plays was nominated by a New England theater company, who produced that play on their stages.Though we have a vibrant new play scene in New England, it’s very difficult for our regional writers to find productions of their plays in other parts of the country. This book will put the script in the hands of theater lovers all across the country. Our hope is that these plays that first found life on stage here in New England will find new incarnations, for new audiences. We want New England to be a net-exporter of theatrical creativity, and this book can help that happen.The New Play Alliance- The New England New Play Alliance is a group of theater companies, playwrights, directors, arts advocates, and students coming together to support new plays created in New England. They work to:
Grow audiences for new plays.
Encourage more new play development and production.
Spread the word outside of Boston about plays/playwrights from Greater Boston/New England”
The New England New Play Alliance currently publishes a free weekly New Play Newsletter that details all the new play events happening in New England. We also released a study on new play attendance in Greater Boston from 2012-2014 and have many other working groups and projects underway.StageSource-StageSource provides leadership and services to advance the art of theater in the Greater Boston and New England region. Our mission is to unite theater artists, theater companies, and related organizations in vision and goals that inspire and empower our community to realize its greatest artistic potential.The lead fundraisers for this project include Patrick Gabridge, a local Boston playwright, Julie Hennrikus, Executive Director of StageSource.In order to get the book published, the publishing company needs us to guarantee that we can sell a minimum of 500 books.We have had Theater Companies around Boston pledge to buy 233 copies.
This means that we are 267 copies short. 
In addition to copies, we also need to raise money for author royalties, post-publication marketing, and to pay some our readers.
If we do not raise this money, the book will not be published and these fantastic plays won’t be shared with theaters, actors, directors, writers, and other theaters across the country. 
We are a group of theater artists in New England invested in showcasing new voices, ideas, and stories. As theater folk, we constantly put together projects that need to happen on budget, and on time.
We are working collaboratively with playwrights and theater companies. The playwrights have a lot at stake in seeing this book published and published well.
Patrick Gabridge and Julie Hennrikus are both published authors who value stories. They have gone through the publishing process. They know what to expect, and know how to approach this.
The selection committee has already been working tirelessly to select the plays for the Anthology.
The publisher, Smith & Kraus, is highly respected and publishes numerous anthologies of plays, scenes, and monologues.

The show is produced by Proof Doubt Closer co-founder, Trace Oakley (who will also direct) and Alena Bernardi (who will musical direct and play the glamorous Lily Garland).ON THE TWENTIETH CENTURY will be the third production of the Proof Doubt Closer Theatre Company, following its critically acclaimed re-imagining of Gilbert and Sullivan's RUDDIGORE, and the musical revue, CARRIE THAT TUNE: HIT SONGS FROM FLOP MUSICALS. Proof Doubt Closer Theatre Company is dedicated to revisiting plays and musicals that fell through the cracks: long-neglected hits, should-a-been successes, ahead-of-their-time flops, and other works that deserve a dusting-off, a hand-up and a new lease on life. We are also dedicated to developing new works, and adaptations. Our name is, in fact, and ironic twist on our mission, as we seek and embrace the rarely-performed buried treasures, and leave the PROOF, DOUBT and CLOSERs of the world to others.Being just a shade more than a year old, the Proof Doubt Closer Theatre Company has progressed well beyond our expectations, in terms of our audience reception, name recognition, but mostly in terms of the performers and other artists who have carried over from one show to the next. We know we are headed in the right direction when outstanding artists want to continue working with us, and also join our production team.We hope you can see, via this page, and through our videos and postings during this campaign, that we are truly passionate about this very special project, and about theatre itself. It is, after all, much more than just a ticket, a good seat or an excuse to dress up. It’s the live reactions, the actors and audience breathing the same air, the thrill, energy and even danger that only a live performance can bring.Part of our job, once we hit the stage, is to make it all look seamless and easy. Let us tell you, easy is hard work. And, even with many participants volunteering their artistic abilities, producing a musical is also rather expensive. Here's a look at the major items on the tab.

 
_____________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________Lead Actor/Musical Director/Producer/Campaign ManagerEver since she was 4 years old Alena had a passion for putting on plays and productions. Any chance she would get to order her little brother or cousins or friends at her daycare around and ""Make a Play"" as she would say; she would.

Alena has starred in all three of Proof Doubt's debut productions.

<p><b>ABOUT PILVAX PLAYERS
THEATER COMPANY AND THE JUNGLE BOOK<br/></b></p>
<p>In our fifth year of producing as Pilvax Players Theater Company, we present a fresh look
of our ""Jungle"" world through this Hungarian musical which is
our first intercontinental production. Also this is our first show where our
young actors, the new Hungarian American generation will be presenting their
talents. 
</p>
<h3></h3>
<p> Our Hungarian American theater company is located
in New York but our cast and creative team is an international group. Some
of our actors came from Hungary, studied acting in Europe. Others were born here just like our little Maugli (Márk Tárkány) or trained as an
American actor, singer or dancer.
All of them are really gifted and work really hard. </p>
<p>Artists at Pilvax Players envision a New York, New
Jersey community where Hungarian Americans are recognized as both
theater-makers and theater-goers. Our productions represent a new generation of
voices in American theater that transcend the label of ""Hungarian
American"" or ""minority.""  We believe to keep the Hungarian heritage alive is extremely important in the USA. We are happy to produce and create this international
theater performance which is based on a classic story, The Jungle Book by Rudyard
Kipling. However our show is totally contemporary. </p>
<p><b>ABOUT OUR HUNGARIAN
JUNGLE BOOK</b></p>
<p><b><i>The Jungle Book</i></b> from 1894 is a collection of stories which are
fables, using animals in an anthropomorphic<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
manner to give moral lessons. Because of its moral tone, it came to be used as
a motivational book in many countries. In Hungary in 1996 the amazing The
Jungle Book was brought to life. Since then it has been continuing to entrance
audiences not only in Hungary but also in cities of Central and Northern
Europe but not in the USA. <br/></p>
<p>László
Dés, the composer and jazz saxophonist, owns a precise sense of proportioning
the elements of jazz with songs for the wider audience. His professional jazz
talent was implemented in pop music creating a higher standard of the genre.
Des’ extraordinary work has been acknowledged by numerous Hungarian and
international awards.   </p>
<p>Péter
Geszti is the co-author of this musical. He is one of the most well-known and
acknowledged character of the Hungarian media and cultural scene. </p>
<p>Pál
Békés (libretto) is a Hungarian writer, playwright, translator. He has a
predilection for an experimental voice, his works are characterized by the
grotesque and the ironic.</p>
<p>This adaptation of The Jungle Book may take place anywhere, in any
jungle, even in a great city’s jungle. You can see the intrinsic qualities of
the characters and the features we, humans attributed to them. This is why Shere Khan’s sings a demagogue blood-demanding rock
song, the funeral entrepreneur vulture’s song cherishing their service reminds
us of the show business, the dangerously coiling python, Kaa’s music is more
Oriental and so on. The musical world of The Hungarian Jungle Book is
undoubtedly colorful and diversified.

</p>
<p>There is humor and irony in music as such as in our show itself. The
music reflects the features of the characters.</p>
<p>Our very gifted musical director, Laura Angyal creates an extraordinary musical adaptation with a world premiere live jazz band on stage.  <br/></p>
<p>Our director, Timea Zsedely has a very contemporary message with this new version of The Jungle Book which is very humanistic and artistic. <br/></p>
<p>Our costume and set designers (Agota Hodi &amp; Agnese Endresz) create an extraordinary visual imagination with a totally new interpretation. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT!</b></p>
<p>There are 5 important reasons to support this show.</p>
<p><b>1. YOU WILL HELP OUR US
PREMIERE! </b></p>
<p>From 1996 more than 1000 performances were in Hungary and Europe but
not in the United States. The show still continues to attract young and old,
children and adults, families and singles. It’s time to show our absolutely new
version of this play in New York and New Jersey than hopefully in more states. </p>
<p><b>2. YOU WILL HELP OUR HUNGARIAN LANGUAGE
TO SURVIVE!</b></p>
<p>Hungarian language is not easy but very poetic and unique. We should
protect and save our language and cultural values through this highly qualified
production. We will keep the original Hungarian language on stage but there
will be English subtitles. That moment when our US-born and not-US-born actors (children
and adults) will create a great show together in the USA by using contemporary
Hungarian language in an artistic way and perfectly, that must be a mesmerizing
and revolving event even in our globalized world. </p>
<p><b>3. YOU WILL HELP OUR YOUNG GIFTED
ARTISTS!</b></p>
<p>We are very proud to find and support our really talented young
artists on stage. <br/></p>
<p>We need your financial help to make the show and presents these young artists on stage.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>4. YOU WILL HELP THE HUNGARIAN AMERICAN
COMMUNITY TO BE MORE CREATIVE!</b></p>
<p>Your support for The Jungle Book will help promote more diversity and inclusion of Hungarian
American artists and stories in the local theater landscape. With our
latest show, we continue to further contribute to the New York and New Jersey
community as we strive to create entertaining and challenging work that is
accessible to anyone and everyone.</p>
<p><b>5. YOU WILL HELP TO SAVE
WILDLIFE!</b><br/></p>
<p>Our show is not only an artistic mission. There is a
very deep moral issue in our adaptation of The Jungle Book. Theater is always
about our surrounding world and often seriously critical. We believe in this
moral issue of the theater and art works. With your help we will support and
make donation to help ensure a future for the earth's most magnificent
creatures and the habitats critical to their survival. <br/></p>
<p>We will donate from our profit of The Jungle Book to help the main Rainforest Foundation and the Defenders of Wildlife. <br/></p>

<p><b>MAKING GOOD THEATER
IS EXPENSIVE</b></p>
<p>A creative process as working on custom and
set design, the rehearsals, marketing and reaching our
audience, having great technicians and an amazing rental space then
finally making a great show on stage, it costs a lot.   <br/></p>
<p>The typical budget for an Off-Broadway play can range from 
$50,000-$250,000. Thanks to the commitments from an extremely talented 
team who are all willing to work for less than their usual rates, we 
have been able to trim that down a bit.  But we still need to raise a 
total of $30,000 for this production.  We started to work (casting, rehearsals, design, marketing) and organize our show in order to get our goal but we 
need your help to rent the space and create the production on stage.<br/></p>
<p>We would like to give a memorable, joyful

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong><i><a href=""https://www.vervethemusical.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VERVE</a></i> is a 90 minute musical</strong> about the power of friendship and the importance of accepting ourselves as we are.  It's a fun-filled journey mixed with  serious moments, all magically uplifted by Karena Mendoza's richly textured, very tuneful music.<strong> </strong><i>VERVE</i> will have its first-ever workshop production at the Edge Off Broadway Theatre  in February as part of the <a href=""https://www.cmtf.org/tickets"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">6th annual Chicago Musical Theatre Festiva</a>l produced by <a href=""https://www.underscoretheatre.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Underscore Theatre</a>.  It is an honor that VERVE was chosen to be part of the festival and an honor that this program is partially supported  by a  grant from the Illinois Arts Council Agency.  As the producer of VERVE as well as bookwriter and lyricist, it is my responsibility to raise funds to match the Arts Council Grant and meet other expenses.</p>
<p><strong><i>VERVE </i>had several staged readings</strong> early in its development, produced by the former Midwest New Musicals Workshop and the Chicago Writers' Bloc, a collective of established and emerging playwrights.  Audience feedback from these performances helped us develop the show further.</p>
<p>Composer Karena Mendoza died five years ago at age 52, always believing in this show and its potential to reach a wide, enthusiastic audience.  I promised Karena before she died that <i>VERVE</i> would one day have a full production.  That day is now and with your support, we can meet our expenses and make <a href=""https://www.cmtf.org/verve"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>VERVE</i></a> the best production possible. I hope you will be able to contribute to this effort.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The total cost of this low budget</strong>, black-box production will be about $8300.

</div></div>","Short Summary
VERVE is a 90 minute musical about the power of friendship and the importance of accepting ourselves as we are.  It's a fun-filled journey mixed with  serious moments, all magically uplifted by Karena Mendoza's richly textured, very tuneful music. VERVE will have its first-ever workshop production at the Edge Off Broadway Theatre  in February as part of the 6th annual Chicago Musical Theatre Festival produced by Underscore Theatre.  It is an honor that VERVE was chosen to be part of the festival and an honor that this program is partially supported  by a  grant from the Illinois Arts Council Agency.  As the producer of VERVE as well as bookwriter and lyricist, it is my responsibility to raise funds to match the Arts Council Grant and meet other expenses.
VERVE had several staged readings early in its development, produced by the former Midwest New Musicals Workshop and the Chicago Writers' Bloc, a collective of established and emerging playwrights.  Audience feedback from these performances helped us develop the show further.
Composer Karena Mendoza died five years ago at age 52, always believing in this show and its potential to reach a wide, enthusiastic audience.  I promised Karena before she died that VERVE would one day have a full production.  That day is now and with your support, we can meet our expenses and make VERVE the best production possible. I hope you will be able to contribute to this effort.
 

What We Need & What


The total cost of this low budget, black-box production will be about $8300. That includes payment to actors, stage director, music director, choreographer and stage manager.  It includes theatre space rental, rehearsal space rental, props, costumes, publicity materials and design, online advertising, audio, and video expenses, and miscellaneous extras.
$4000 will be covered by the Illinois Arts Council Agency grant. We project ticket sales to net between $1000 to $2000.  We need to raise up to $3000 to cover the difference.
Perks for your generosity include:  Thank you in on social media and in  the VERVE program;  11 x 17 digital VERVE poster, a drink at Burke's Public House, appetizer at Pasteur Restaurant; tickets to VERVE;  VERVE T-shirt, 'psychedelic' brownie recipe and more.

<h3>About Our Campaign</h3>
<p>Same Boat Theater Collective was formed by seven San Francisco Bay Area playwrights and theater artists seeking to unite our passions for theater and for the environment. We're raising funds to help us launch our first projects, including a collaboratively-written full-length play that we hope to present this August. Every dollar you donate will go directly toward the creation of brand new work for the stage with an environmental focus.</p>
<p>Our mission is to bring innovative, meaningful theatrical experiences about environmental issues to as diverse a local audience as possible, with the goal of generating a critical mass of individuals to act against environmental degradation. We aim to change the current narrative by telling stories about our bioregion, the Bay Area, for all species who live here.</p>
<p>Environmental threats like climate change can feel both overwhelming and abstract, which makes them hard to fight. We want to change that. With your help, we want to move audiences from passive observers to active environmentalists, and to bring to life the impacts of environmental degradation in a way that is theatrical, engaging, inclusive and immediately actionable.</p>
<p>You can learn more about us at <a href=""http://www.sameboattheater.org.%C2%A0SBTC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sameboattheater.org</a>. SBTC is grateful to be fiscally sponsored by PlayGround, a 501(3)(c) not-for-profit theater, as part of the Innovator Incubator Program.</p>

<h3>Our Projects</h3>
<p>We have a lot in the works for 2019-20! Your donations will help us get the following projects on their feet:</p>
<ul>

<strong><i><span>T</span>he Emeryville Horror</i></strong>, a full-length play about the effects of climate change and environmental degradation on underprivileged populations in the Bay Area. The play, currently being collaboratively written by SBTC playwrights in consultation with diverse local  communities, concerns the mysterious disappearance of the city of Emeryville, piece by piece. We hope to hold a staged reading in June 2019 with a production later in the year.</li>
<li>
<strong>Site-specific performances</strong>,<strong> </strong>which will allow audiences to connect sensually and emotionally with the natural world in conjunction with exploring stories about that world.</li>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Following the success of their first production, Matt &amp; Ben, Blowfish Theatre Company presents ""Paani"". ""Paani"" is a devised theatre piece that chronicles experiences in, of, and around anti-Muslim racism in North America. It is a story that, in our current social and political climate, has to be presented and responded to. Catch the show’s premiere at the St. Ambroise Montreal Fringe Festival 2017, opening on June 8th at Venue 11- Studio Multimedia du Conservatoire.</p>
<p>""Paani"" is directed by Anurag Choudhury, who last directed Matt &amp; Ben (Blowfish Theatre Company, September 2016). It is produced by Nikita Bala and Rana Liu, who co-founded Blowfish Theatre Company in the summer of 2016.</p>
<p>The play, being a devised piece, has been a collaboration between the entire production and performance team. An amalgamation of live music, dance, spoken word, mask, and storytelling - performed by members of Blowfish. We would be nothing without our company.</p>

We follow the bustling life of <strong>Mama Nadi</strong> in her bar/brothel in a small mining town, experiencing the turmoil of war-torn DRC through the distinctive and gripping voices of the three women who work for her. <strong>Josephine</strong> - the daughter of a tribal chief who was taken by soldiers. <strong>Salima</strong> - who after being captured by rebels, spent five months in the bush as their concubine. And <strong>Sophie</strong> - ""ruined"" by sexual violence. We brush shoulders with Mama Nadi's customers and come to understand the war from many different perspectives.</p><p>Lynn Nottage is one of America's most important and compelling playwrights. <i>Ruined</i>, was born from a series of interviews she held with girls and women who experienced (and continue to experience) the traumas of war firsthand. It is a story of love, loss, self-sacrifice, and most importantly, hope.</p><p>By putting a human face on those caught in the struggle, we hope to raise awareness about what is happening in the Congo, and increase understanding and compassion for victims of sexual violence wherever they are.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509414069/iu0iu1hztrcmfckxll26.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Dark Glass Theatre exists to tell stories of people we might not otherwise meet, thereby decreasing judgement, increasing compassion, and fostering empathy.

As we see past labels and cultural differences, we are empowered to act in love. And that action can change the world.</p><p>Artistic Director, Angela Konrad is an award-winning director and educator who believes in the power of theatre as a force for good.

We follow the bustling life of Mama Nadi in her bar/brothel in a small mining town, experiencing the turmoil of war-torn DRC through the distinctive and gripping voices of the three women who work for her. Josephine - the daughter of a tribal chief who was taken by soldiers. Salima - who after being captured by rebels, spent five months in the bush as their concubine. And Sophie - ""ruined"" by sexual violence. We brush shoulders with Mama Nadi's customers and come to understand the war from many different perspectives.Lynn Nottage is one of America's most important and compelling playwrights. Ruined, was born from a series of interviews she held with girls and women who experienced (and continue to experience) the traumas of war firsthand. It is a story of love, loss, self-sacrifice, and most importantly, hope.By putting a human face on those caught in the struggle, we hope to raise awareness about what is happening in the Congo, and increase understanding and compassion for victims of sexual violence wherever they are.Dark Glass Theatre exists to tell stories of people we might not otherwise meet, thereby decreasing judgement, increasing compassion, and fostering empathy. We believe one of the most damaging forces in our world is the demonizing of ""the other"". By coming face to face with another’s perspective, without judgement, we are able to break down barriers that separate us and celebrate our common humanity. As we see past labels and cultural differences, we are empowered to act in love. And that action can change the world.Artistic Director, Angela Konrad is an award-winning director and educator who believes in the power of theatre as a force for good. Associate producer Jessica Garden is a freelance director and social justice advocate with a desire to make a difference through meaningful stories. They are grateful to Lynn Nottage for the gift of this remarkable play.RUINED has a large cast and therefore a large budget. With a dozen people on stage, it's easy to see why we need your help making this happen! Our Indiegogo campaign is a vital part of our fundraising, a way for you to join us in bringing this important story to the stage. Your dollars go to actors' salaries, to costumes, to set, to props, to publicity. Check out the pie chart for more info. The bottom line is that our bottom line needs you!We have assembled some fantastic perks to thank you for your donations. From jewelry and prints, to renderings and back stage passes, we want you to know how important you are to us. Choose the donation level and reward that fits you best. And then consider yourself a citizen of Dark Glass City.If you throw the word ""Congo"" into Google, you will get news stories with today's date. News stories with titles like, ""Rape in the DR Congo: An economic war on women's bodies"" or ""Visit with displaced women, children, touches Haley.""You will read how women in the Congo are working to dispel their country's image as the rape capital of the world and instead establish a new reputation as the ""world capital of sisterhood and solidarity."" You will also read how those working for change within the country risk their lives every day, and how many lose that battle. But despite the ongoing brutality of the conflict and the startling immediacy of the headlines, most in North America know very little about what is happening in this beautiful, ravaged country. Most have no sense of the extent of the conflict, the millions who have been killed, millions more displaced, the appalling poverty and starvation in such a wealthy country, the instability and of the illegitimate government, or the cost of this war on women. We want to do what we can to change that.RUINED brings us face to face with those caught in conflict. It enables us to see their humanity and understand their pain. And it motivates action.After each performance of RUINED, we will hold talkbacks with the cast, alongside special guest hosts who know something of the issues in the play -- the Congo, sexual exploitation, war, humanitarian aid... We will give voice to women who are oppressed and abused, in the Congo and here at home. And we will work together to be part of the solution.This is an audacious project for a young company. It's a huge cast and a huge budget. Its set and costumes must evoke an actual world and a metaphorical reality. It has live music and real guns. But we have stepped forward in faith believing that this story must be told, believing in the incredible artists who have assembled to tell it, believing in the support and generosity of those around us. Prove us right.We understand that not everyone is able to donate towards the campaign, however there are still many ways you can help! #1: Come and see our show! It runs January 25 - February 17, 2018. We'd love to see your friendly faces there. Tickets#2: Share our campaign with your friends and family, telling them why you think it is worthwhile. #3: Familiarize yourself with the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly the horrific toll the conflict is taking on women in that country. Find out what you can do to break the silence and stop the violence.",26.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>What is the Alumni Company?</strong></h2>
<p>Each summer, the Shakespeare Academy @ Stratford invites former students to return to Stratford to create and perform a four-actor mobile production of a play by Shakespeare.</p>
<p>With support from Community and Educational Outreach Director, Tia James and the entire SA@S faculty and staff, the Alumni Company is tasked with creating, directing, performing and producing a play of Shakespeare. Putting the skills they gained during their time as students at SA@S into practice and gaining real-world experience in all aspects of theater making.</p>

<li>planning and managing a tour</li>
<li>set, costume and sound design</li>
</ul>
<p>Last year's Alumni Company has passed the baton onto a quartet of intrepid theatremakers: <strong>Kaitlyn Fowler</strong>, <strong>Bridget Wagar</strong>, <strong>Steven Miles</strong>, and <strong>Chandler Vance</strong>.  To support their residence in Stratford and the tour this summer, we hope to raise $2500. That breaks down to $700 for travel expenses, $500 for production costs, $800 for actor pay, and $500 to cover living expenses while in Stratford.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Last summer, four actors (Mia DeLasho, Olivia Gregorich, Jacob Nurick, and Rebeka Rosales) took to the road with a trunk, a boombox, and their production of A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM. For two weeks, they travelled throughout the Northeast, making stops in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York City. The Alumni Company began and ended their tour at the home of SA@S, the White House.  They performed at summer camps, art galleries, people's homes, and parks. Last year's Alumni Company not only grew as artists and collaborators, but they engaged with communities and local businesses to bring Shakespeare to people of all ages and walks of life. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""One of the most rewarding parts of the experience (and also one of the biggest challenges) is creating a truly self-contained show. You have minimal sets and costume resources, just whatever you can pack into a trunk, the rest of the story really comes from yourselves as actors. You have to build the rest of that world with your bodies and voices, and the best part is when you can see the audience is in that world with you."" -</i>Mia DeLasho (Alumni Co. 2016)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""For company members, this is a unique opportunity to take ownership of our own theatre-making experience, experiment and explore collaboratively.  Confidence in choice making and cross-over in responsibility for production roles is the main benefit of this freedom--working on multiple aspects of one production expands the appreciation for the way those different threads interweave, and experiences as a director can feed one’s approach to acting and vice versa.  Theatre is a field where being able to generate, publicize, and produce one’s own work is an incredible asset. "" -</i>Olivia Gregorich (Alumni Co. 2016)</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""The most rewarding part of the experience was when audience members stumbled upon the performance, like when we were at Short Beach in Stratford, CT... When kids would just sit completely rapt in the play and what we were doing. They got it. That's a pretty amazing feeling as an actor.""</i>- Kelly Letourneau (Alumni Co. 2015)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""I think the energy and imagination that comes from switching spaces so often was exciting for the actors as well as the audience—it’s no wonder that so many of the venues were immediately excited to be on the docket for next season’s performances. We got to perform for children groups (wonderfully excitable audiences) and put on free performances for a lot of people that otherwise would not be seeing theater, much less Shakespeare, at all. It was wonderful to have people show up for the shows (a couple even followed us to other venues to see it again) but there was also a certain magic in a person turning a corner from the modern world and chancing upon a classic story they weren’t expecting—something like Bottom into the world of the fairies."" </i>-Nate Currier (Alumni Co. 2015)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>Nate Currier of the 2015 Alumni Company put it best:</p>
<p>""Projects like these necessitate myriad risks and challenges. It is not easy to cut down Shakespeare and put on a show, without a director, four actors and serious budget constraints, with staging versatile enough to be done in any manner of spaces. There is a lot of ego on the line, trying to put forward something you can be proud of. There is the challenge of working with your peers and managing different skill sets and deficiencies. There is the challenge of trying to balance creativity with time management. And of course, there is the main risk that after all this work, simply no one will show up.</p>
<p> But one amazing thing about theater is that often it is the risks and the challenges that lead to growth, to intrigue and to change. “Risk” is not a dirty word in theater. The truth is, we don’t watch movies and shows to be entertained. We see them to be challenged—our beliefs, our intellect, our convictions, our disbelief—and to overcome those challenges. Audiences see theater to challenge and learn about themselves. And if the actors are not challenged, how could the audience ever be?""</p>
<h2><strong>The Mighty Quinn Foundation, Inc. </strong></h2>
<p>SA@S and its Alumni Company are a project of the Mighty Quinn Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charity dedicated to providing educational and theatrical experiences for young artists. A lifelong Stratford resident, Quinn Rooney grew up next door to the theater grounds and always hoped to see them revitalized. He passed away in June 2012 from a rare form of brain cancer at age 19, having led life to the fullest. SA@S holds the example of Quinn's great joy, utmost generosity, indefatigable spirit, and love for the fellowship of sharing theater with friends at the heart of its founding values.</p>

There is a lot of ego on the line, trying to put forward something you can be proud of. There is the challenge of working with your peers and managing different skill sets and deficiencies. There is the challenge of trying to balance creativity with time management. And of course, there is the main risk that after all this work, simply no one will show up.
 But one amazing thing about theater is that often it is the risks and the challenges that lead to growth, to intrigue and to change. “Risk” is not a dirty word in theater. The truth is, we don’t watch movies and shows to be entertained. We see them to be challenged—our beliefs, our intellect, our convictions, our disbelief—and to overcome those challenges. Audiences see theater to challenge and learn about themselves. And if the actors are not challenged, how could the audience ever be?""
The Mighty Quinn Foundation, Inc. 
SA@S and its Alumni Company are a project of the Mighty Quinn Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charity dedicated to providing educational and theatrical experiences for young artists. A lifelong Stratford resident, Quinn Rooney grew up next door to the theater grounds and always hoped to see them revitalized. He passed away in June 2012 from a rare form of brain cancer at age 19, having led life to the fullest. SA@S holds the example of Quinn's great joy, utmost generosity, indefatigable spirit, and love for the fellowship of sharing theater with friends at the heart of its founding values.

<div class=""column"">
<p><span>When I was seventeen years old, I decided I was going to going to direct musical theater for the rest of my life. At the time, the most edgy piece of theater I knew was </span><span>RENT, </span><span>and so I cofounded a theater company and directed an entirely teen production of </span><span>RENT </span><span>as an AIDS benefit. Looking back, I had no clue what it was like for the characters living in the east village of 1989 with a fatal virus, had no clue what it was like to fall in love, and truly don’t know where my confidence as a director came from, seeing as I had only been doing high school theater for three years and had never worked with a professional director. All I know is that the music inspired me, and I cared about sharing the messages of the show. In </span><span>Passing Strange, </span><span>the narrator has a moment where he turns to the audience and says, “You know, it’s weird when you wake up that morning and realize that your entire adult life was based on a decision made by a teenager."" Looking back, I share Stew’s sentiment over the fact that a passionate teenager chose the path my life would take. I’ve never known where exactly that decision would lead me, nor do I know where I am headed next, but seventeen-­‐year-­‐old me knew that I wanted to make beautiful and socially relevant musical theater. At this point in my life, </span><span>Passing Strange </span><span>is the epitome of that goal. </span></p>
<p><span>Passing Strange </span><span>is the journey of a young, black (composer and lyricist Stew resents the use of the term “African American” because, after all, not all dark-­‐skinned people are from Africa) musician from his LA home—haunted by mom, Church, terrible punk music, and the notion that he has to fill a specific community-­‐determined role—through the sensual, pot haze paradise of happy Amsterdam, to fiery Berlin’s art riots. Haunted by his racial roots, distant phone calls from home, and a desire to make meaningful music that sets him apart as an individual, the Youth searches for his identity and “the real” until his </span><span>mother’s death brings him home. This homecoming forces him to finally see himself, and to look back on the mistakes that not only he, but all youth, make. He realizes that the most real thing in the world was right at his fingertips the whole time: love. For me, this piece is about so many things: how your roots define and influence you, what it means to be authentic, how we are shaped by our immediate surroundings, what it means to be young and what it means to be an adult, how to remain an individual without isolating yourself from love, and the power of art to heal. I find </span><span>Passing Strange </span><span>extremely relevant because these ideas are faced daily by artists and humans alike. </span></p>
<p><span>I am passionate about the message of this musical; in an age where we are becoming more and more excluded from one another, the show’s theme that “only love is real” radiates, and proves that by reconnecting us, art can heal this malady. </span><span>Passing Strange </span><span>does just that: the music fills our souls and connects everyone in the room to its messages and to each other. </span></p>

</div></div>","FROM CATIE DAVIS'S PAPER, PROPOSING THIS PROJECT TO THE NYU FACULTY:

When I was seventeen years old, I decided I was going to going to direct musical theater for the rest of my life. At the time, the most edgy piece of theater I knew was RENT, and so I cofounded a theater company and directed an entirely teen production of RENT as an AIDS benefit. Looking back, I had no clue what it was like for the characters living in the east village of 1989 with a fatal virus, had no clue what it was like to fall in love, and truly don’t know where my confidence as a director came from, seeing as I had only been doing high school theater for three years and had never worked with a professional director. All I know is that the music inspired me, and I cared about sharing the messages of the show. In Passing Strange, the narrator has a moment where he turns to the audience and says, “You know, it’s weird when you wake up that morning and realize that your entire adult life was based on a decision made by a teenager."" Looking back, I share Stew’s sentiment over the fact that a passionate teenager chose the path my life would take. I’ve never known where exactly that decision would lead me, nor do I know where I am headed next, but seventeen-­‐year-­‐old me knew that I wanted to make beautiful and socially relevant musical theater. At this point in my life, Passing Strange is the epitome of that goal. 
Passing Strange is the journey of a young, black (composer and lyricist Stew resents the use of the term “African American” because, after all, not all dark-­‐skinned people are from Africa) musician from his LA home—haunted by mom, Church, terrible punk music, and the notion that he has to fill a specific community-­‐determined role—through the sensual, pot haze paradise of happy Amsterdam, to fiery Berlin’s art riots. Haunted by his racial roots, distant phone calls from home, and a desire to make meaningful music that sets him apart as an individual, the Youth searches for his identity and “the real” until his mother’s death brings him home. This homecoming forces him to finally see himself, and to look back on the mistakes that not only he, but all youth, make. He realizes that the most real thing in the world was right at his fingertips the whole time: love. For me, this piece is about so many things: how your roots define and influence you, what it means to be authentic, how we are shaped by our immediate surroundings, what it means to be young and what it means to be an adult, how to remain an individual without isolating yourself from love, and the power of art to heal. I find Passing Strange extremely relevant because these ideas are faced daily by artists and humans alike. 
I am passionate about the message of this musical; in an age where we are becoming more and more excluded from one another, the show’s theme that “only love is real” radiates, and proves that by reconnecting us, art can heal this malady. Passing Strange does just that: the music fills our souls and connects everyone in the room to its messages and to each other.

</div></div>","Our Story



We are the Resident Artist Ensemble.  We have chosen to make Springfield, Missouri our home.  Located in the Ozark region of southwest Missouri, Springfield is experiencing exponential growth, accompanied by the ongoing emergence of a culturally rich, artistic community. In relation, we have discovered a need in the region for additional professional, AEA* sponsored, theatre. It is the Resident Artist Ensemble’s philosophy that the arts are a vital ingredient in the development of a vibrant, fiscally sound, community-centered city.  In response, we are laying the foundation for a permanent, resident artist ensemble, notably as a means to provide a long-term collaboration of regional professional theatre artists. Kicking off this new artist-led ensemble is the inaugural production of the Pulitzer Prize Winning play, Rabbit Hole, which features a core of founding members that includes three seasoned professional Equity actors, a beloved Springfield theatre veteran, and rising young local actor.  In order to produce Rabbit Hole’s inspiring portrayal of loss and forgiveness, we have partnered with the Springfield Contemporary Theatre at the Vandivort Center, a prolific, non-profit organization that has generously included us in their 16th season.  We are excited to present this award-winning play in a three-week run, opening September 9th 2011, and running through September 24th 2011.  It is our aim to utilize this inaugural production as a springboard for the development of the Resident Artist Ensemble as a long-term fixture in the southwest Missouri region.

 
*Actors' Equity Association (""AEA"" or ""Equity""), founded in 1913, is the labor union that represents more than 48,000 Actors and Stage Managers in the United States. Equity seeks to advance, promote and foster the art of live theatre as an essential component of our society.

THE IMPACT
 
It has long been the stance of Actors’ Equity Association that the professional arts are a catalyst for economic development, quality of life, and civic pride in an urban community.  Studies in urban development strongly support this outlook. In contrast, studies also demonstrate how mid-sized urban centers facilitating growth in the absence of the professional arts commonly experience significant economic and population recessions in the decades that follow. In short, the professional arts are a core part of successful, long-term, urban growth. In relation, The Springfield New leader states, “Springfield will be recognized for its innovation and creativity-laden arts, culture and tourism as a catalyst for economic development, quality of life and civic pride -- all while maintaining its place as the cultural hub of the Ozarks.” With large polulations of Americans currently searching for financial stability alongside a high quality of family-centered life, the mid-sized city of Springfield and the surrounding Ozark region is growing rapidly. Accompanying this population growth is a significant increase in the city’s corporate activity, real estate development, and the emergence of shopping districts.  In line with the New Leader’s trajectory and the AEA philosophy, Springfield and the Ozark region is ripe for the creation of additional high-level, professional, AEA sponsored theatre.




 
The Resident Arist Esemble will serve as a key new ingredient in Springfield’s existing theatre and arts infrastructure. It will contribute significantly to the presence of professional theatre in the Ozark region and fuel Springfield’s development as a vibrant, fiscally sound, and community-centered city.

<h2>Help Kidd Pivot take <i>The
Tempest Replica </i>on tour!</h2>
<p></p>
<p>After a year-long sabbatical, Kidd
Pivot is gearing up to take their most recent creation, <i>The Tempest Replica</i>, on a multi-city tour to Canada, the US, and
the UK.  Kidd Pivot is excited to bring
this work back to the stage, but we need your help to share it with new
audiences on two continents.</p>
<h2>A bit more about the project...</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Created by internationally acclaimed
choreographer Crystal Pite, <i>The Tempest
Replica </i>has been called “a triumph” by the New Jersey Star Ledger and “an
art work of astonishing beauty and thoughtfulness” by the New Yorker. Based on motifs from
Shakespeare’s <i>The Tempest</i>, Pite
stages a game of revenge and forgiveness, reality and imagination. <i>The Tempest Replica</i> explores these
motifs in two contexts: a maquette of Shakespeare’s island as a metaphor for
isolation, captivity and desire, and a nostalgic cityscape that evokes longing.</p>
<p>About
the piece, Pite says “<i>The Tempest Replica</i>
presents Shakespeare’s play in two parallel worlds...My hope for the viewer is
that, armed with the plot points of a narrative, he or she is more deeply
invested in the performance: the choreography becomes more than just a dance
between two people – rather, it is imbued with a story we have all shared”. </p>

Hi there! Thanks for popping in. We're the Saint John Theatre Company, the largest theatre company in southern New Brunswick and we're proud to say, volunteer-run. 
We're the people in your neighbourhood and we're getting ready to put on a show! We launch our 2013-14 season with Annie:The Musical, November 14-16, 2013 and this year, we're going to need your help.
Auditions have already started and rehearsals will stretch through the summer – which means our costs have started too. Our total budget for Annie is about $75,000 and while tickets sales are our largest revenue source, it won't be enough to get us to centre stage.


Here's How You Can Help 
We want to raise $7,500 – 10 per cent of our total production budget – by reaching out to you, our friends, neighbours, admirers and soon-to-be fans.
Your contribution will help us with hard costs of our productions including:

set design;
costumes;
props; and,
theatre rental of the majestic Imperial Theatre – one of the greatest theatres in Canada. (We're not kidding, it's a gorgeous place to perform.)

We've got some fun perks that will introduce you to some of the real life characters who bring the Theatre Company's productions to life. So join our campaign; we bet our bottom dollar you're going to like it here.
As for when the sun is going to come out...we'll leave that for one of our perks.


Other Ways You Can Help


No cash? No problem, you can help us by:

I’ve adapted my debut title “A Place for Ida into a “Stage Play, “IDA.” I produced it in September, 2012 at The Art Place, in Marietta, GA. I produced it on a shoe string budget because of my passion and belief in my work. “IDA” received great reviews however; my expenses were in the RED!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since writing the first paragraph of “A Place for Ida” I envisioned it being a Movie, Stage Play and a Sequel. I started writing the sequel before completing “Ida.” However, I was not that successful in getting it on the “Big Screen” or the Stage. It took me fourteen years of listening to lies and promises from people that lifted my spirit, hoping that someone was finally going to help me live my dream, to no avail! So I produced it myself and I’m doing it again on a shoe string budget.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“IDA” is scheduled to be performed, August 3, 2013 at 7 pm at Saint Philip AME Church-Atlanta, GA. Again, I’m stepping out on faith; with God’s grace I’ll have a better return this time. Oh, did I mention that “IDA” is a Christian based play.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please, no donation is too small. I don’t have fourteen more years for my dream to prevail. I’m 58 years old. Funding will be use to pay for: Venue, Cast, Wardrobe, Travel, Food and Advertisement.</p>

<h3>Why Fund All's Well?</h3>
<p>As far as we can tell, Shakespeare's ""All's Well That Ends Well"" has never been done in Chattanooga—and there's no time like the present. Shakespeare Chattanooga, founded in 2006, is the only company in town focused entirely on the classics. My goal in creating it was to bring a level of interpretation to Shakespeare's work that hasn't been seen here before, except in road shows.</p>
<p>This play's time has come. Long considered a ""problem play"" because its main characters and subject matter were unsympathetic to audiences of other ages, its themes and people will be very recognizable to the 21st century. We've assembled a super cast, director Stephanie Smith has a wonderful vision for the piece—now we just need your help.</p>
<p>Whatever you contribute will go one of two places: salaries for cast and crew, or productions costs. We keep things simple, but from the very beginning, have always attempted to compensate our company to some level at least.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>• We're looking to raise $3,000 through Indiegogo. This won't pay for the whole show, but we are doing other forms of fundraising as well. We expect the show to cost about $5,000, because we have a donated space, the theatre inside Grace Episcopal Church, so won't have to pay rent.</p>
<p>• Here are the perks we are offering at various levels of donations...but donate whatever you can! No donation is too small.</p>
<strong>Level 1 ($10): </strong>Shout-out in the program as ""Bud of the Bard""</div>
<div>
<strong>Level 2 ($25): </strong>1 plus one free ticket to any ""All's Well"" performance (August 16-18 and 23-25)</div>
<div>
<strong>Level 3: ($50): </strong>1 plus two free tickets to any ""All's Well"" performance</div>
<div>
<strong>Level 4: ($100): </strong>1 plus four free tickets to any ""All's Well"" performance</div>
<div>
<strong>Level 5: ($250): </strong>1 plus 4 plus one free tuition to the next session of ""Shakespeare for the Elizabethan Impaired"" (value $175)</div>
<div>
<strong>Level 6: ($500): </strong>1 plus 4 plus 5 plus a one-time walk-on during the ""All's Well"" performance of your choice for you or your proxy</div>
<div>
<strong>Level 7: ($1,000, limit 1): </strong>All of the above plus a private performance of ""All's Well"" at your home or the space you designate.<br/><p>If we do not reach our entire goal, all funds raised will be divided equally between salaries to performers and crew and production costs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
By helping us produce ""All's Well That Ends Well,"" you'll be contributing in a big way to the growing arts community in Chattanooga. Shakespeare Chattanooga hopes one day to be able to create a Shakespeare Festival here, and so far, we've produced ""Othello,"" ""Twelfth Night,"" ""Much Ado About Nothing"" and ""The Merchant of Venice,"" along with an original complilation, ""Songs, Sonnets and Soliloquies"", as well as doing workshops in schools, at the Main Library, and co-producing on projects with several other arts organizations.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If you can't contribute funds (and boy, do we sympathize!) please help us get the word out to as many people as possible about the show, and about this fundrasing campaign. We're also looking for volunteers to help work the show, so if you'd like to help that way, let us know!</div>

Whatever you contribute will go one of two places: salaries for cast and crew, or productions costs. We keep things simple, but from the very beginning, have always attempted to compensate our company to some level at least.


What We Need & What You Get
• We're looking to raise $3,000 through Indiegogo. This won't pay for the whole show, but we are doing other forms of fundraising as well. We expect the show to cost about $5,000, because we have a donated space, the theatre inside Grace Episcopal Church, so won't have to pay rent.
• Here are the perks we are offering at various levels of donations...but donate whatever you can! No donation is too small.
Level 1 ($10): Shout-out in the program as ""Bud of the Bard""

Level 2 ($25): 1 plus one free ticket to any ""All's Well"" performance (August 16-18 and 23-25)

Level 3: ($50): 1 plus two free tickets to any ""All's Well"" performance

Level 4: ($100): 1 plus four free tickets to any ""All's Well"" performance

Level 5: ($250): 1 plus 4 plus one free tuition to the next session of ""Shakespeare for the Elizabethan Impaired"" (value $175)

Level 6: ($500): 1 plus 4 plus 5 plus a one-time walk-on during the ""All's Well"" performance of your choice for you or your proxy

Level 7: ($1,000, limit 1): All of the above plus a private performance of ""All's Well"" at your home or the space you designate.If we do not reach our entire goal, all funds raised will be divided equally between salaries to performers and crew and production costs.


The Impact
By helping us produce ""All's Well That Ends Well,"" you'll be contributing in a big way to the growing arts community in Chattanooga. Shakespeare Chattanooga hopes one day to be able to create a Shakespeare Festival here, and so far, we've produced ""Othello,"" ""Twelfth Night,"" ""Much Ado About Nothing"" and ""The Merchant of Venice,"" along with an original complilation, ""Songs, Sonnets and Soliloquies"", as well as doing workshops in schools, at the Main Library, and co-producing on projects with several other arts organizations.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute funds (and boy, do we sympathize!) please help us get the word out to as many people as possible about the show, and about this fundrasing campaign. We're also looking for volunteers to help work the show, so if you'd like to help that way, let us know!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What are we Fundraising for?</h3>
<p><strong>&lt;UPDATE&gt;</strong></p>
<p>The Internship Team has finished interviews and has come to a consensus: <strong>we are extending two offers to two excellent candidates</strong>. One offer is for a full 13 weeks, while the other is for 7 weeks with an opportunity to extend to a full 13 weeks based on FreeGeek finances and Community consent.</p>
<p>The 13 week position has been offered to Alex CG, an awesome candidate who applied for the 2012 position and made last year’s choice difficult. This year we hope to have Alex CG do some great work in organizing a variety of regular workshops and our now annual Software Freedom Day.</p>
<p>Our 7 week position has been offered to Alex Cox, another outstanding candidate who is currently a student at Colombia College. We hope that she will bring some great talent to helping us develop an online store and marketing materials.</p>
<p>A full profile of each intern will be released upon acceptance of their position.</p>
<p>We hope that you can help us get the support we need to extend Alex Cox for a full summer position: <strong>An additional $1200</strong>. Though our campaign will close tomorrow evening, any financial help now and after this deadline will get us closer this new goal. If you have already contributed, please share this request.</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>
<p><strong>&lt;/UPDATE&gt;<br/></strong></p>
<p>FreeGeek Chicago will offer our third-annual, <strong>paid</strong> summer internship to an individual who can help expand our services to the community and our earned revenue sources. The intern will help lead our second-annual Software Freedom Day and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a regular program of educational workshops to be hosted at FreeGeek that will be open to the general public, OR</li>
<li>Research online marketplaces and develop a FreeGeek store for selling branded items (T-Shirts, Buttons, Stickers, etc.) and a vast array of odd-ball items that have value but can't be sold in our physical thrift shop, OR</li>
<li>Produce educational materials to take on-the-road and present to businesses, school groups, churches, civic groups, and other community organizations, OR</li>
<li>Create and accomplish an independent project or program that will help produce financial or other benefits for the FreeGeek Community.</li>
</ul>
<p>In exchange, FreeGeek will pay our Summer Intern $15.00 per hour for 160 hours of work for a total of $2,400.</p>
<p>A full internship description is available on our <a href=""http://freegeekchicago.org/internship"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Internship Application Page</a>.</p>
<h3>Campaign Goals</h3>
<p>We have set our campaign goal this year at $2800.</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,400 will be paid to the intern for 160 hours of work.</li>
<li>$400 will be retained by FreeGeek Chicago to cover staff time and expenses dedicated to the internship program (ex: Campaign fees will be about $150).</li>
<li>All donations that exceed the final published internship budget will go towards our general programming.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why are we Fundraising?</h3>
<p>The FreeGeek Community sees our Summer Intern program as a key investment in the growth of our organization. The intern will focus on projects that increase our service to the community and increase our revenue. As with all great investments, the financial pay-offs from an intern's work will come later while the costs will be up-front. Instead of applying for grants or loans, we are appealing to our diverse support network to help fund this program. Read more about this in our <a href=""https://freegeekchicago.hackpad.com/Statement-on-Funding-qJJmD3oNxTe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Statement of Funding</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Pay an Intern?</strong></h3>
<p>At FreeGeek, we strongly believe that those who put in effort above and beyond what is asked of regular volunteers be compensated in some way. In addition, unpaid internships are a luxury that many individuals, including many FreeGeek volunteers, can not afford. While a FreeGeek intern will receive incredible experience, we also want to ensure that they receive fair compensation for their work. Offering a paid internship will keep the program accessible to everyone and will give FreeGeek an even better pool of applicants.</p>
<h2>Intern Successes!</h2>
<h3>2012 Intern</h3>
<p>Our Summer Intern for 2012 was the wonderful Cecilia Calabria, who came to FreeGeek with a fantastic background in the open-source community as well as a ton of entrepreneurial experience. Originally from Argentina, Cecilia was establishing herself in the United States and FreeGeek's Internship gave her an opportunity to connect with the local FOSS community.</p>
<p>By the end of her internship, Cecilia produced a ton of fantastic work for FreeGeek including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translating of FreeGeek promotional materials into Spanish</li>
<li>Preparing for a variety of outreach events</li>
<li>Organizing the first FreeGeek-hosted <a href=""http://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org/2012/USA/IL/Chicago/FreeGeek"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Software Freedom Day</a> event, drawing in over 65 participants.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2011 Intern</h3>
<p>The first FreeGeek Summer Intern was Axel Rendon, a long-time volunteer. Axel had progressively increased his troubleshooting and repair skillset in our OpenBuild program and was a natural choice to work on our toughest problem at the time: getting laptops on the sales shelves. During his internship, he focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning, organizing, and running our laptop repair area.</li>
<li>Working through a backlog of laptops to repair for sale.</li>
<li>Lending help to our sole paid staff member to keep the shop open.</li>
</ul>
<p>Laptops are always in demand at FreeGeek and Axel's efforts produced some great summer revenue for the community.</p>
<p><strong>We are still benefiting from all of the work these individuals accomplished and with your help, we can repeat this success with this year's summer internship program!</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by our indiegogo page! We’re Johnny Lloyd and William Steinberger, but together we’re <strong>InVersion Theatre</strong>, a Philadelphia-based company started in 2011. Now in our third year of existence, we’re dedicated to exploring works that ask questions about the human condition. Past shows have included <em>SHEPARD/BECKETT</em>, <em>The Dutchman</em>, and <em>Miss Julie</em>.</p>
<p>This time around, we’re digging deep into the work of one of the most fascinating writers of the last 100 years, Caryl Churchill, with her play <em>Owners</em>. It’s a story about haves, have nots, and what it takes to attain and maintain control – all centering around a dispute between a landlord and her tenants. Sounds a little bit relevant? We thought so, too.</p>
<p>Of course, as a small theater company we’re always in the need of a little bit of support from our community.  Specifically, we need help with the following things:</p>
<p>1)      Space. We can’t have a show if we don’t have a venue!</p>
<p>2)      Compensating actors, designers, etc. We think the work our creative team members do is pretty rad, and while they like it when we tell them that, they like it even more (and can afford to do more rad work) when we’re able to give them a small stipend. It’s our way of letting them know we take them – and all artists – seriously, even if we’re a small company.</p>

<p>Johnny and Will</p></span></span></div>","Hi all-
Thanks for stopping by our indiegogo page! We’re Johnny Lloyd and William Steinberger, but together we’re InVersion Theatre, a Philadelphia-based company started in 2011. Now in our third year of existence, we’re dedicated to exploring works that ask questions about the human condition. Past shows have included SHEPARD/BECKETT, The Dutchman, and Miss Julie.
This time around, we’re digging deep into the work of one of the most fascinating writers of the last 100 years, Caryl Churchill, with her play Owners. It’s a story about haves, have nots, and what it takes to attain and maintain control – all centering around a dispute between a landlord and her tenants. Sounds a little bit relevant? We thought so, too.
Of course, as a small theater company we’re always in the need of a little bit of support from our community.  Specifically, we need help with the following things:
1)      Space. We can’t have a show if we don’t have a venue!
2)      Compensating actors, designers, etc. We think the work our creative team members do is pretty rad, and while they like it when we tell them that, they like it even more (and can afford to do more rad work) when we’re able to give them a small stipend. It’s our way of letting them know we take them – and all artists – seriously, even if we’re a small company.
3)      Technical capacity. InVersion believes in creating a world for our audience, and in order to do that we need money – to build, to clothe, to light, to create.
4)      Marketing. When we’re proud of our work (and we certainly always aim to be), we want everyone to know. Donations go to helping us create press materials and get them all around Philadelphia.
Will and I will occasionally be in this space to give you guys updates, but before you donate we just wanted to say thank you for supporting us. Whether you’re a long-time supporter or a first-time donator, it’s good to know that we’re loved by our community and hopefully we can do you all proud in 2013.
So – take a gander at our sweet perks, check out our webpage and facebook page, and tell all of your friends about us. Thanks so much!

<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p>Mnemonic Theatre began as the brainchild of Caleb McMullen and Jordan Dibe: two young, naïve theatre makers. Over three years, it has evolved into a unique crucible of production, artists development and community outreach.  Through workshopping new works, producing emerging artist showcases, full scale productions and networking events, we have developed <strong><em>4 CORE VALUES</em></strong> which speak to who we are and what we believe in.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>INNOVATION</strong> progress doesn't happen by following suit.  We say no to the status quo.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>ACCOUNTABILITY</strong> we insist on being held accountable to the quality of our work. Judge us please!</em></li>
<li><em><strong>VITALITY</strong> we tell stories that are worth remembering.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>COMMUNITY</strong> we're all in this together.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>More information about us can be found at <a href=""http://www.MnemonicTheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.MnemonicTheatre.com</a> </p>
<h3><strong>ROMEO AND JULIET</strong></h3>
<p>This production is the first in what we hope will be a yearly celebrated offering of free Summer Shakespeare at Vancouver's Sunset Beach!</p>
<p>Romeo and Juliet at Sunset Beach is our take on Shakespeare in the Park. The Public Theatre's Shakespeare in the Park, founded by Joseph Papp, was intended to 'give back' to the community as an introduction to the things that drive theatre artists and to remove the economic barriers that consistently isolate and attenuate the community reached through the theatre.  It is in this same spirit that we're offering this <em>FREE</em> production.  </p>
<p>We have cast some of the most exciting emerging artists in Vancouver and have given them the opportunity to share their newly developed talent. The casting process allowed us to make some unconventional choices by casting women for the roles of Romeo and Mercutio (to play the role as women). We cast the best actors in the roles that they rightfully deserved.</p>
<p>Casting women as the two lovers was a happy accident, but also proves that the greatest love story ever told transends the limitations of sex, sexuality and gender. <em>Love is love in all its forms.   </em>    </p>
<h3>WE NEED YOUR HELP</h3>
<p>We are doing this on a shoe-string budget (as we do most things). This is how our budget gets broken down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honorariums: $500</li>
<li>Sets: $150</li>
<li>Costumes: $310</li>
<li>Props: $50</li>
<li>Marketing: $300</li>
<li>Printing: $350</li>
<li>Misc: $100</li>
<li><strong>TOTAL: $1,710</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our campaign goal on Indiegogo is set at $1000 since that is the minimum amount with which we could pull this production together. So, we come to you, our friends, family, peers, supporters and theatre enthusists. Your generousity will help us acchieve our funding goals and accomplish our artistic endevour.</p>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We are proud of our track record of accomplishments.  When we decide to do something... it happens.  Follow-through is our speciality.  And <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is no exception.  </p>
<p>Our rehearsal process has been incredibly exciting.  Supporting this project means you are also supporting a slew of incredibly talented and passionate emerging artists in Vancouver: recent graduates of both UBC and Studio 58.</p>
<p>Your contribution will also help to diversify the theatre scene in Vancouver.  The more quality theatre that is produced, the stronger our community becomes, the further we can push our mandate to diversify the artform.</p>
<p>But most of all, your contribution supports a project designed not for an indiviudal's or company's benefit. This project is designed to be a gift of free theatre.</p>
<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h3>
</div>
<p>We know what it's like to love something, to want to help something or someone out. But being artists, we also know what it's like to be broke... Have no fear.  </p>
<p>Want to help out?  Shoot us an email! Sometimes an hour of your time, or donating some of your skills can be worth more than any dollar amount.  We love meeting new people who share our values.</p>
<p>Most importantly, if you want to help out... COME OUT.  It's FREE, FUN, and FAST. Bring a blanket, your friends and your loved ones.  Tell your friends, post on facebook, share, like, tweet, tumbl, insta, snap etc!   </p>

</p><p><b>Storyline</b></p>
<p><i>Transformatique</i> is a series of eight vignettes
that each represents moments of personal transformation within a larger journey of growth, fulfillment, reconciliation, and a sense of integration in a
broader collective. Based on a confessional short story and the paintings it
inspired, the piece incorporates theater/performance, dance, movement, music,
and visual art as it explores the ways in which life can be transformative,
even in the simplest of moments.</p>
<p>Co-creators Greg Serebuoh &amp; Travis Tyler Brimner bring
you a story of conscious transformation from spiritual isolation to a
heightened awareness of self.</p>
<p><b>Creating Work for NY
Artistic Community</b></p>
<p>Although the creative process for this piece began over a
year ago, <i>Transformatique </i>is buzzing with energy <i>right
now </i>as we’re taking all of our ideas and breathing life into them. We
have 8 incredible actors, a technical crew, and a creative team to pay,
rehearsals to hold in rented rehearsal space, and costumes and sets to be
dreamed up and brought to reality. The money we raise is going directly to
those individuals and activities so that we can premiere this work that we are
so excited about on December 4th at Dixon Place in
Manhattan. This production <i>directly</i> supports the creative
community of New York City.</p>
<p><b>The Difference Your
Contribution Makes</b></p>
<p>One of the things that makes New York City an awe-inspiring,
vibrant, and vital cultural mecca for people around the world is its
incredibly broad creative offerings.  Most of us were drawn to New York
City by the diverse spectrum of creative experiences for which it has always
been known. Performance art, Off-Broadway theatrical works, and
independent productions like <i>Transformatique</i> form an important part
of that spectrum.  Without them, there would be a major dynamic missing in
this magical city. Since we are not backed by big production
companies, we look to art lovers and supporters to help us fund our project and
share our creative vision.  This is the difference your contribution makes
to our production and to New York City - it helps to keep the city’s diverse
artistic spirit alive.</p>
<p><b>What’s Next?</b></p>
<p>We plan to use the premiere as a launching point for turning
this production into a regularly running show. This will be no small feat, but
we are enthusiastic about the piece and are dedicated to continuing to build
it.</p>

FadaDancers Heather Cameron and Fran Gilboy.

<p>
</p><p>“FadaDance?
 What's that?”</p>
<p>
</p><p>“FadaDance”
means a few things.  There's the FadaDance performing company,
comprised of the three founding members of FadaDance (Misty, Heather
and Fran).  These three ladies have been performing together as
FadaDance for 10 years and have become a vital piece of Regina's arts
community.  
</p>
<p>
</p><p>FadaDance
is also probably the coolest dance studio in Regina.  With almost 325 students who range in age from 2-50, FadaDance encourages creativity
and participation while still focussing on technique, flexibilty and
discipline.  
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And,
finally, the FadaDance Youth Company, 30 awesome kids who train at
the studio, many of whom have attended previous daCi conferences and
need your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For
more information about FadaDance, look here:  <a href=""http://fadadance.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://fadadance.ca/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's
not an easy or inexpensive thing to get 30 kids plus teachers and
chaperones from the Canadian prairie to the north of Europe.  All of
the kids and parents are working very hard, fundraising for this
trip.  Those kids who have attended previous daCi conferences can
(and will, if you let them) tell you what amazing experience meeting,
learning from and dancing with kids from all over the world is.  It's
not just a dance education, it's an education education.  
</p>
<p>
</p><p>“DaCi?
 Explain, please.”</p>
<p>
</p><p>DaCi,
or Dance and the Child International, is an international conference
which happens every three years, each time in a very different part
of the world.  Our kids will have the opportunity to meet, learn from
and dance with kids from every corner of the globe.  They will
perform work that they have helped create for an international
audience of dancers, dance teachers and enthusiasts.  It is, quite
simply, the chance of a lifetime.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>“Is
this the only thing you're doing to raise money?”</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of
course not!  The Fada community is a creative bunch of folks.  We've
done steak nights, bottle drives, flower sales, and arts camp,
performances of ALL kinds, and have quite a few other things up our
sleeves before we fly.</p>

and participation while still focussing on technique, flexibilty and
discipline.  


And,
finally, the FadaDance Youth Company, 30 awesome kids who train at
the studio, many of whom have attended previous daCi conferences and
need your help.

For
more information about FadaDance, look here:  http://fadadance.ca/

It's
not an easy or inexpensive thing to get 30 kids plus teachers and
chaperones from the Canadian prairie to the north of Europe.  All of
the kids and parents are working very hard, fundraising for this
trip.  Those kids who have attended previous daCi conferences can
(and will, if you let them) tell you what amazing experience meeting,
learning from and dancing with kids from all over the world is.  It's
not just a dance education, it's an education education.  


“DaCi?
 Explain, please.”

DaCi,
or Dance and the Child International, is an international conference
which happens every three years, each time in a very different part
of the world.  Our kids will have the opportunity to meet, learn from
and dance with kids from every corner of the globe.  They will
perform work that they have helped create for an international
audience of dancers, dance teachers and enthusiasts.  It is, quite
simply, the chance of a lifetime.

For
more information about daCi and what they do, look here:

“Is
this the only thing you're doing to raise money?”

Of
course not!  The Fada community is a creative bunch of folks.  We've
done steak nights, bottle drives, flower sales, and arts camp,
performances of ALL kinds, and have quite a few other things up our
sleeves before we fly.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

In addition to other fundraising opportunities, <strong>if we meet our fundraising goal we will be able to donate an entire night's worth of ticket profits to Bully-Free Florida Network</strong>. Fundraising and awareness efforts to support this cause will be intertwined with our show. </p><p>Utilizing iconic characters that we all know and love, our staging aims to push the boundaries of social identification. Through CB’s existential journey, we put the audience back into the uncomfortable stage of teenage adolescence. Utilizing realistic dialogue, circumstances and peer pressure, audience members revisit the awkward phases of figuring out who they are and who they want to be vs. who everyone else tells them they should be. We're not all “written”  to be a certain way. Our production challenges what others think of us in an effort to be the best version of ourselves, even in the face of adversity, all in an attempt to become a little less... predictable. </p><p>By funding our show you are not only supporting local arts you are standing up for everyone who has been bullied, pushed-around and put down. We are a local production, striving to provide community art and entertainment that has a heart and a message. We showcase talented young people aspiring to follow their dreams through the performing arts. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead</strong></p><p>Written by Bert V.

In addition to other fundraising opportunities, if we meet our fundraising goal we will be able to donate an entire night's worth of ticket profits to Bully-Free Florida Network. Fundraising and awareness efforts to support this cause will be intertwined with our show. Utilizing iconic characters that we all know and love, our staging aims to push the boundaries of social identification. Through CB’s existential journey, we put the audience back into the uncomfortable stage of teenage adolescence. Utilizing realistic dialogue, circumstances and peer pressure, audience members revisit the awkward phases of figuring out who they are and who they want to be vs. who everyone else tells them they should be. We're not all “written”  to be a certain way. Our production challenges what others think of us in an effort to be the best version of ourselves, even in the face of adversity, all in an attempt to become a little less... predictable. By funding our show you are not only supporting local arts you are standing up for everyone who has been bullied, pushed-around and put down. We are a local production, striving to provide community art and entertainment that has a heart and a message. We showcase talented young people aspiring to follow their dreams through the performing arts.  Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage BlockheadWritten by Bert V.

His best friend is too burnt out to provide any coherent speculation; his sister has gone goth; his ex-girlfriend has recently been institutionalized; and his other friends are too inebriated to give him any sort of solace.

It is also the name for Spain's operetta tradition. It alternates between music and dialogue, and usually has several dance numbers. It is heavily influenced by Spanish folkloric styles. Zarzuela is very popular in Spain and other Latin American countries, but has been mostly unknown in the United States. Thanks to the efforts of famed singer Plácido Domingo, zarzuela has recently raised curiosity and gained recognition in the U.S., especially in cities like L.A. and Miami. Like Mr. Domingo, I find zarzuela to be a marvelous art form that needs to be performed more often in the U.S., which has led me here to this campaign.</p><p><b>The Show</b></p><p>I am collaborating with Main Street Opera and Casa Italia Italian Cultural Institute of Chicago in producing our very first zarzuela, ""La Dolorosa"", by José Serrano. Zarzuela is rarely performed in Chicago, and this will be the Chicago premiere of ""La Dolorosa.""</p><p>In ""La Dolorosa"", Rafael, a novice monk, secludes himself in a
monastery after being disappointed in love. There, he comes across the woman
that he once loved and undergoes a terrible spiritual struggle between duty and
love 
Serrano's work is an excellent example of zarzuela at its eclectic best. It has drama, comedy, dance and romance - all in a neat one hour package. It is a show that can be enjoyed by anyone- one of zarzuela's great qualities.<br/></p><p>Furthermore, what makes our show so special is that it is perhaps one of the only, if not the only, zarzuela performed in Chicago in the original Spanish language. By honoring the original language, we have kept the witty libretto by Juan José Lorente intact. We have also catered this to a Spanish speaking audience, a community that is a very present entity in Chicago. Non-Spanish speakers can still enjoy the show as there will be English supertitles. The shows will be August 22nd at Casa Italia and September 19th at the Cervantes Institute.<br/></p><p><b>The Campaign</b></p><p>We need to fund raise <b>$500</b> for this production.

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>★★★★★ ""Physical Theatre at its finest. Unmissable!...The hairs on the back of my neck, all the way down my spine and along my arms stood straight up” <strong>Everything Theatre.</strong></p>
<p>Ephemeral Ensemble is an international physical theatre company. Combining the skilled physicality of the performers, playful stage craft and original music, Ephemeral Ensemble strives to create original, sincere and ambitious work that is inspired by human stories.Corporeal mime technique is at the centre of our devising process. We seek harmony on the stage that comes from varied voices from different backgrounds during our process. The ensemble was founded in 2016 by Eyglo Belafonte and Ramon Ayres.</p>
<p>OFFSTAGE responds to the subject suicide, which is often hidden behind the curtain in public life, not being treated with the respect that it deserves. A subject surrounded by stigma that usually enables people to talk openly about it, and to recognise and respond to suicidal behaviour. Using onstage and backstage as a metaphor for public and private lives, OFFSTAGE takes a look behind the curtain at loneliness and depression in a sensitive and timely  exploration of suicide. In a universe, where theatre is life and life is a dream we find two performers, Harley and Pedro. We capture their joys when they are onstage, facing the public with masks, hats and a beautiful smile on their faces. Out of the spotlight however, the mask comes off and they face their struggles. They do whatever they can to help each other through their show night after night.<br/>We interviewed those affected by suicide. People who have had contemplated suicide, suffering alone with thoughts or feelings of hopelessness. We also spoke to people, who went through the heartbreak of losing a loved one to suicide. <br/>Ultimately, our piece is about the fragility of life and the loneliness of those who suffer alone.</p>
<p>After the success of the rough first outing of the show, we have been given the opportunity to take OFFSTAGE to Edinburgh, where we'll be able to showcase it in the best possible environment with a daily slot at the prestigious PLEASANCE THEATRE. The donations gathered through this site will help us with our accommodation in Edinburgh, transportation of the team and set as well as our marketing during the Fringe Festival.<br/> </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Support so far </h3>
<p><strong>Funded by</strong> Arts Council England through Grant for the Arts</p>
<p><strong>Supported by :</strong></p>
<p>PAPYRUS -  Prevention of Young Suicide<br/>L.A.S - Life After Suicide<br/>SOAS Social Anthropology professor David Mosse<br/>Pleasance Theatre<br/>Haringey Council</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>This campaign's goal is a crowdfunding contribution towards our total fundraising target. We have already raised money in other ways, as well as putting money in ourselves.<br/>We want to leave the impact of our work with the audience and show the work to as many people as possible, sharing the subject of suicide sensitively with the respect it deserves. <br/>The financial support will help us to take the work to the festival where the work will grow in quality and visibility.</p>
<p>Your contribution will go towards:</p>
<p>ACCOMODATION:<br/>It’s a long way from home so we need somewhere to rest and keep warm during those long (and famously wet!) Scottish Summer nights. Your contributions will help us pay for a  base for our team during the run.</p>
<p>MARKETING AND PR: <br/>With over 3,000 other shows going on at Fringe, marketing and PR are key to raising awareness and standing out from the crowd during the Fringe. The money you donate will go towards registration fees, advertising, posters and flyers helping us to build a strong presence.</p>
<p>TRAVEL: <br/>There are over 400 miles between London and Edinburgh, money raised will help pay for the train fares of company members, as well as transportation for our set.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Any help you can give, however big or small, is incredible and helps this production to make a difference in the festival. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help us spread the message by sharing this campaign with your friends, family and any other person, who could possibly help. As well as promoting our shows through word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and any other way you can possibly think of!</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have any other resources that you feel could help us, please get in touch. Contributions in all forms are valued!</p>

★★★★★ ""Physical Theatre at its finest. Unmissable!...The hairs on the back of my neck, all the way down my spine and along my arms stood straight up” Everything Theatre.
Ephemeral Ensemble is an international physical theatre company. Combining the skilled physicality of the performers, playful stage craft and original music, Ephemeral Ensemble strives to create original, sincere and ambitious work that is inspired by human stories.Corporeal mime technique is at the centre of our devising process. We seek harmony on the stage that comes from varied voices from different backgrounds during our process. The ensemble was founded in 2016 by Eyglo Belafonte and Ramon Ayres.
OFFSTAGE responds to the subject suicide, which is often hidden behind the curtain in public life, not being treated with the respect that it deserves. A subject surrounded by stigma that usually enables people to talk openly about it, and to recognise and respond to suicidal behaviour. Using onstage and backstage as a metaphor for public and private lives, OFFSTAGE takes a look behind the curtain at loneliness and depression in a sensitive and timely  exploration of suicide. In a universe, where theatre is life and life is a dream we find two performers, Harley and Pedro. We capture their joys when they are onstage, facing the public with masks, hats and a beautiful smile on their faces. Out of the spotlight however, the mask comes off and they face their struggles. They do whatever they can to help each other through their show night after night.We interviewed those affected by suicide. People who have had contemplated suicide, suffering alone with thoughts or feelings of hopelessness. We also spoke to people, who went through the heartbreak of losing a loved one to suicide. Ultimately, our piece is about the fragility of life and the loneliness of those who suffer alone.
After the success of the rough first outing of the show, we have been given the opportunity to take OFFSTAGE to Edinburgh, where we'll be able to showcase it in the best possible environment with a daily slot at the prestigious PLEASANCE THEATRE. The donations gathered through this site will help us with our accommodation in Edinburgh, transportation of the team and set as well as our marketing during the Fringe Festival.

What we need
This campaign's goal is a crowdfunding contribution towards our total fundraising target. We have already raised money in other ways, as well as putting money in ourselves.We want to leave the impact of our work with the audience and show the work to as many people as possible, sharing the subject of suicide sensitively with the respect it deserves. The financial support will help us to take the work to the festival where the work will grow in quality and visibility.
Your contribution will go towards:
ACCOMODATION:It’s a long way from home so we need somewhere to rest and keep warm during those long (and famously wet!) Scottish Summer nights. Your contributions will help us pay for a  base for our team during the run.
MARKETING AND PR: With over 3,000 other shows going on at Fringe, marketing and PR are key to raising awareness and standing out from the crowd during the Fringe. The money you donate will go towards registration fees, advertising, posters and flyers helping us to build a strong presence.
TRAVEL: There are over 400 miles between London and Edinburgh, money raised will help pay for the train fares of company members, as well as transportation for our set.
 
Any help you can give, however big or small, is incredible and helps this production to make a difference in the festival.

<h3>The Story of an Author and the Work</h3>
<p>Greetings and good tidings dear viewers!</p>
<p>Back when I was performing “Romeo &amp; Juliet” during my time at Salt Lake Community College, I was struck by a novel idea: what if you replaced Romeo with Hamlet?</p>
<p>The more and more I worked on this story the more and more I knew it was a story worth telling. After spending YEARS working on the script I am utterly confidant that this is the project that will proves my worth as a writer and director to the world. “The Romance of Wind &amp; Fire” is a dramatic romance unlike any you have seen before! Watch how these timeless characters and timeless tale change from how the world knows them so well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goals</h3>
<p>There are a couple levels to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raise the $1200 necessary to fund the project for the festival performances.</li>
<li>Generate enough positive buzz to parlay that into a viable interest in seeing the full 5 act stageplay produced following our initial performance on our festival run.</li>
<li>Have a successful and strong fundraising campaign to encourage future fundraising efforts. The more we can raise the better footing we will have moving forward.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This might be the pivotal moment of several aspiring careers here.<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">.</span></p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Waspish Theatre Company was set up in 2018 by an all-female creative team, each with a passion to give a voice to the vulnerable. 'Ideology and Hair Gel', written by Lizzie Corscaden and directed by Bethany-Ann Wilkinson, is Waspish Theatre's first full-length production, and examines the effects of political turmoil on the young and powerless.</p>
<p>The Edinburgh Fringe is the perfect place to showcase this politically-charged piece and launch Waspish Theatre into the spotlight, so that we can continue to give a voice to the unheard.</p>
<p>'If I be waspish, best beware my sting'- The Taming of the Shrew by William Shakespeare</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While the Edinburgh Fringe is the perfect place to showcase new work, it is also expensive. Your money will go towards registration fees, accommodation, venue hire, sets, props, costumes and much much more. We believe that theatre has the power to create positive change, and even the smallest donation will go along way towards making that happen.</p>
<p>But there are benefits for you too! By donating, you could get anything from a social media shout out, to free tickets for the show, or even your own personalised photobook, signed by the entire cast and crew! Check out our perks for more details.</p>
<h3>Meet the Waspish Team</h3>
<p><strong>Artistic Director - Bethany-Ann Wilkinson</strong> is a director from Royal Holloway University, in her final year of studies. Bethany-Ann’s credits as a director include Shakespeare’s King Lear, Measure For Measure, A Midsummer Nightmare and The Nether by Jenifer Haley. Bethany enjoys creating moments of theatre out of everyday objects such as torches and sheets; having already workshopped some light play, she is extremely excited for audiences to experience what our workshop cast have created.  She is also interested in creating feminist, political theatre and so is extremely excited to take on the challenges of Ideology and Hair Gel. The play has some wonderful moments that emphasise the integrity and vulnerability that young women possess in a changing world. She can’t wait for you to watch this brilliant play!</p>
<p><strong>Associate Playwright - Lizzie Corscaden</strong> had her first play produced in 2007, when she was only twelve years old (it was about an irritating donkey). Since then, she has written and worked on many pieces for the theatre, as well as training at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama and becoming a published author of short fiction. Much of her work explores themes of mental health and wellbeing, and the effects of society upon the vulnerable. The idea for Ideology and Hair Gel first came to Lizzie seven years ago, and is based on a number of true stories that she has been aching to share with the world. Lizzie is thrilled to be working with the Waspish team on this production, and can't wait to see where Bethany-Ann's vision takes it.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Development Manager - Eleanor Rutter</strong> has past experience in directing, dramaturgy, producing, stage management and deputy stage management. Between the ages of four and eighteen she was a performer, with her interest in theatre beginning when she was four years old as a ballet and contemporary dancer. Her main interests in theatre are early modern drama, British and American contemporary dance and drama, musical theatre and poetry in performance. She loves Ideology and Hair Gel because it is a wonderful blend of history and drama. This production is important to her as it will be her first professional production outside of an amateur or university environment.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Manager - Emily Wilkinson</strong> has previously worked as both a stage manger and deputy stage manager, but is particularly excited to be taking a show to the Edinburgh Fringe for the very first time. Ideology and Hair Gel  has an interesting concept and Emily has enjoyed seeing it come to life through research and development workshops. She can’t wait to see what it will become.</p>
<p><strong>Company Producer - Eleanor Ball </strong>has previously worked with York Theatre Royal to direct and produce her first short film, and has experience in performance, directing, stage management and deputy stage management. This has included working with Ealing Studios and Pilot Theatre, where she first experienced political theatre performing in ‘Everything is Possible: The York Suffragettes’. Her interest mainly lies in the relationship between historical politics and theatre and is loving exploring the dynamic present in Ideology and Hair Gel. She is excited to expand her knowledge of theatre-making and travel to Edinburgh with the Waspish Team.</p>

<p>Mr. Berrent has toured internationally with <em>Cirque du Soleil</em> for 8 years, beginning in 2003 with <em>Alegría</em>.  In 2006, Jason's talents were discovered by writer and director David Shiner (Tony Award winner for Broadway’s Full Moon). Shiner invited Berrent to create the lead role of ‘The Trickster’ in Cirque du Soleil's multi-million dollar spectacle, KOOZA.  The character quickly became a Cirque favorite amongst fans and artists alike.  Jason received stellar reviews for his performance which can be seen on the live DVD recording of the show.</p>
<p>Other stage appearances include Nicky Silver’s Fit To Be Tied (Los Angeles), The Cohen Project (San Francisco) and <em>Alegría</em> by Cirque du Soleil (Int'l Tour).  Jason has appeared in commercials and ads for Adidas Originals, The Sundance Channel, Beatles Rockband, xBox Dance Central and Infiniti Motors.</p>

<p><strong>Cinda RamSeur  -  Sultry.</strong></p>
<p>Ms. RamSeur's sound has evolved into one that is rooted in pop, R&amp;B and Jazz.</p>
<p>Ms. RamSeur's music is straight up, no gimmicks, no heavy sequencing.  She invited the listener into her world putting her heart and soul into her lyrics and vocal delivery.  The result is reminiscent of a quiet fire - gentle, yet powerful.</p>
<p>Ms. RamSeur's voice embodies pure strength, purity and elegance.  She has long been respected among her colleagues in the music industry and has toured with many of the brightest stars of pop, R&amp;B and jazz including Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, Whitney Houston and Herbie Hancock to name a few.</p>
<p>Ms. RamSeur has appeared on Broadway with Dreamgirls and The Lion King.  Most recently she was the lead singer of <em>Cirque du Soleil</em>'s spectacle, Kooza.</p>

Mr. Berrent, a native of Washington, D.C., is an American actor and producer best known for his work with the world-renowned Cirque du Soleil.
Mr. Berrent has toured internationally with Cirque du Soleil for 8 years, beginning in 2003 with Alegría.  In 2006, Jason's talents were discovered by writer and director David Shiner (Tony Award winner for Broadway’s Full Moon). Shiner invited Berrent to create the lead role of ‘The Trickster’ in Cirque du Soleil's multi-million dollar spectacle, KOOZA.  The character quickly became a Cirque favorite amongst fans and artists alike.  Jason received stellar reviews for his performance which can be seen on the live DVD recording of the show.
Other stage appearances include Nicky Silver’s Fit To Be Tied (Los Angeles), The Cohen Project (San Francisco) and Alegría by Cirque du Soleil (Int'l Tour).  Jason has appeared in commercials and ads for Adidas Originals, The Sundance Channel, Beatles Rockband, xBox Dance Central and Infiniti Motors.

<h2><strong>THE GAY HERITAGE PROJECT</strong></h2>
<h3>World Premiere!</h3>
<p>November 17-Dec 8, 2013</p>
<p>The GHP Collective in association with Buddies In Bad Times Theatre, Toronto.</p>
<p>“Three of our country’s most gifted creator/performers set out to answer one question: <em>is there such a thing as gay heritage</em>? In their search, they uncover a rich history not often shared, shine new light on contemporary gay culture, and fantasize about the prospect of legacy. The result is a hilarious and moving homage to the people who came before us and the events that continue to shape our lives.”            -- <a href=""http://www.buddiesinbadtimes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.</strong><strong>buddiesinbadtimes.com</strong></a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What’s the GHP?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Gay Heritage Project Collective</strong> was formed in 2008 by the three of us: Damien Atkins, Paul Dunn, and Andrew Kushnir. We are all three award-winning theater artists who, in our early careers, created and performed solo plays that investigated growing up gay in our respective contexts.</p>
<p>Now in our thirties, we wanted to develop a theater piece that could reflect a more evolved perspective on queerness, history and community. As queer people, what is our relationship or connection to other queer people? Is there history we ought to know, but don’t? Are there things we shouldn’t forget? What sort of theatrical experience could we create to inspire an authentic and personal sense of togetherness – no matter what your sexual orientation or cultural background? Gay playwright/activist Larry Kramer’s imperative from <em>The Tragedy of Today’s Gays </em>rang in our ears: “GET OUT THERE! DO SOMETHING FOR EACH OTHER!”</p>
<p>We started to look at the concept of <strong>HERITAGE</strong> -- and not heritage as a noun, but heritage as a kind of <em>verb</em>. How do you search for heritage? We got excited about heritage being a <em>live</em> thing: a dialogue between individuals and community, between past and present, and in our case, between “storyteller” and “audience”. Heritage is a concept typically used to describe a particular cultural nationality – we wanted to create a piece of theatre that asks: <strong>is there a kind of nationhood among queer people? If yes, what does it look like? If not, can we imagine one together?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Show</strong></h3>
<p>The GHP Collective has been developing the show in residence at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre, <strong>the world’s largest and longest running queer theatre</strong>. What we’ve come up with is a kinetic, surprising, kaleidoscopic journey through the past, present and future. The play looks at everything from the Toronto bathhouse raids to homonationalism to Michel Foucault to the secret gay language of Polari to Canadian and international LGBT heroes. We take a good look at our own personal experiences and pasts. And naturally, a healthy look at The Wizard of Oz.</p>
<p><strong>The play is by no means a comprehensive or conclusive articulation of gay heritage for anyone and everyone to adopt.</strong> For us, it’s about demonstrating what can happen when you embark on a personal search for things like lineage, shared history and legacy.  <strong>On November 17, 2013, <em>The Gay Heritage Project </em></strong><strong>will have its World Premiere as part of Buddies’ 2013/14 season<em>. </em></strong><strong>It will also mark the “coming out” of a new Toronto collective that is interested in exploring the queer experience through a bold, theatrical lens.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GHP Collective needs your help to make this world premiere possible!</strong> Your donations will help us communally affirm the importance of manifesting, preserving, and passing on the ghosts, the stories, and the challenges of queer people that have walked before us. You will help us investigate, question, and celebrate aspects of the contemporary queer experience. You will help us illuminate our own particular strand of history and culture – not in order to emphasize it above other strands, but weave it into the human fabric with as much vitality and honesty as it demands and deserves. Your support will help create an engaging, entertaining and affirming piece of art.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p><em>The Gay Heritage Project </em>is a co-production between Buddies and the GHP Collective. That means the GHP Collective has to contribute our half. We are not an institution, we are three guys. And though we’ve been aggressively fundraising, the GHP Collective is $5000 shy of our overall budget.</p>
<p>Every single dime raised through this Indiegogo campaign is going towards covering the cost of building, rehearsing, and running <em>The Gay Heritage Project </em>for the fall of 2013. Funds raised will go towards covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>the design, materials and construction of our set and costumes</li>
<li>the rental of a rehearsal hall</li>
<li>artist fees (that includes equitable rates for actors, a director, lighting/set/costume/sound designers, a projection designer)</li>
<li>the fee for a stage manager</li>
<li>renting projecting equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>$5000 might not seem like a lot but it makes a huge impact on the realization of <em>The Gay Heritage Project</em>. $5000 means our designers can achieve the full extent of their design vision – that sum can cover both the cost of materials and the construction of our set. That $5000 lets us book a good rehearsal hall for the number of hours we need to get this play on its feet, it helps us launch a strong marketing/publicity campaign for the show. Perhaps most importantly, $5000 makes the difference between us affording a complete rehearsal process, or having to abridge our rehearsal period to save money. <strong>This $5000 will ensure that <em>The Gay Heritage Project </em>comes together in the way we dreamed it would and has the best possible premiere.</strong></p>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal, whatever you’ve generously donated will go directly into covering costs for the show. Every dime counts and every dime helps. We hope that everything from our Big Gay Thank You to a pair of Opening Night tickets (and a fruit pie!) are enough to entice you to give whatever you can. You are helping a group of artists serve their community in a singular and compelling way. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>The Big Gay Dream is to eventually tour <em>The Gay Heritage Project </em>nationally through Canada, and internationally to whoever will have us. This play examines LGBTQ narratives within a global context and we have a great interest in seeing our “community” beyond Church Street, beyond Toronto, even beyond Canada. We are committed – as three writer/performers who have been politically active and publicly “out” since the very beginning of our careers – to art that is rigorous, inclusive, and socially pertinent.</p>
<p>Gay history, gay culture, gay ideas don’t typically get passed on by blood relatives the way other cultural heritages do (be it Italian, Jewish, or even Canadian). We feel a particular responsibility to the young queer people and hope that our personal journeys through <em>The Gay Heritage Project </em>can inspire and educate. Again, it’s not that our version of heritage is in any way definitive. <strong>What we hope is that people from all walks-of-life get something out of witnessing three artists searching for a heritage.</strong></p>
<p>We look forward to partnering with various Toronto-based LGBTQ organizations during the run and provide space at the theater for their promotion and outreach. We plan to follow select performances with Q&amp;As with prominent Canadian LGBTQ figures. We plan to hold a creation workshop with Buddies’ queer youth group to offer some tools for putting <em>their </em>stories on stage. We hope to make this production a true community event.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the theatre community growing each year, c2c theatre seeks out challenging opportunities for theatre professionals working in the city of St. John's. We program contemporary theatre from around the world in an effort to showcase this city's talented artists and bring the world stage a little closer to home. While we continually work towards keeping expenses low and artist fees high, we depend on the support of municipal and provincial funding as well as members of the community. Small donations of $20-$50 go a long way to making a production like this possible and worthwhile for the artists involved. We've set our goal at $2000 but the more we raise the better we can produce this fantastic piece.</p>

c2c theatre is presenting Art by Yasmina Reza and we need your help! In order to put off this amazing comedy we need to raise funds to offset the production costs, namely the venue rental, performance rights and set materials. With these expenses covered all additional revenue can go right into the pockets of the artists involved. Since these professionals are donating their time we want to raise whatever we can! The artists involved are: Neil Butler, Rory Lambert, Dave Sullivan, Nicole Rousseau, Brian Bishop and Kirsti Mikoda. With your support we can bring their talents to the stage and offer St. John's this award winning comedy just in time for spring. 
 
About The Play
 
 
 
The story revolves around three friends—Serge, Marc and Yvan—who find their previously solid 15-year friendship on shaky ground when Serge buys an expensive painting. The canvas is white, with a few white lines. Serge is proud of his horribly expensive acquisition, fully expecting the approval of his friends.
Marc scornfully describes it as ""a piece of white shit,"" but is it the painting that offends him, or the uncharacteristic independence-of-thought that the purchase reveals in Serge?
For the insecure Yvan, burdened by the problems of his impending doom (wedding) and his dissatisfaction at his job as a stationery salesman, their friendship is his sanctuary...but his attempts at peace-making backfire. Eager to please he laughs about the painting with Marc but tells Serge he likes it. Pulled into the disagreement, his vacillations fuel the blazing row.
Lines are drawn and they square off over the canvas, using it as an excuse to relentlessly batter one another over various failures. As their arguments become less theoretical and more personal, they border on destroying their friendship.

<h3>Rock Bottom Movement </h3>
<p>""No stage, no lights, no gimmicks, no problem. We've hit rock bottom so we might as well dance."" The motto for this emerging dance company, started when a frustrated dance major student decided that enough was enough. Building upon the foundation that no two people are alike, the work of Rock Bottom Movement introduces the interpretors as artists and individuals celebrating unsual personality qualities and movement that is as much a personal investigation for the dancers as it is for the audience. Frustrated with not having enough opportunity to perform or to share her artistic vision, fourth year Ryerson Dance student Alyssa Martin, being her true stubborn self hopped on a bus and picked up her Toronto Busking Lisence, rounded up a few of her extremely talented yet gritty dance friends and started creating Rock Bottom Movement's first piece, ""plaything in two movements."" In June, they travelled around Toronto for many afternoons performing in parks, squares and ferry docks accompanied by a live saxophone quartet. Later that summer, the gang celebrated Canada Day with DES(S)ERT SESSIONS, a new work, while busking on Front Street accross from CanStage. In September, Rock Bottom Movement had their first gig. A piece for all females, ""venUS in furs"" was performed at the Cabbage Town Festival. Despite the cold rainy weather and the fact that the stage was the size of an IKEA kitchen table, the dancers threw their sneakers and sweaters on and performed the piece on the wet pavement rolling around in puddles and rain. Most recently, the group performed as part of Venetian Ball performing alongside acts such as Frankie Avalon in front of 800 paying guests. Rock Bottom Movement is an initiative to create fresh contemporary movement which can appeal to dance audiences and non-dance audiences alike.</p>

<p style=""""><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">In the early twentieth century, interest in the dramatic arts grew tremendously on college and university campuses. By 1920, most colleges had a dramatic organization staging plays annually for the campus and the community at large. Also around this time, little theatre productions and dramatic workshops began taking place. This furthered the interest in theatre on campuses everywhere, especially in the western part of the country. At this time, several honororary groups were formed to recognize </font><img align=""right"" alt=""Paul F. Opp, Founder"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.alphapsiomega.org/images/opp.jpg"" src="""" style=""border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial;""/><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">and reward exemplary student participation in those productions.</font></p>
<p style=""""><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">In 1921, at Fairmont State College in Fairmont, West Virginia, college theater took root. A faculty director was hired in 1923, and the Masquers were formed. The Masquers were charged with presenting a season of 4 to 5 major productions per year for students and the general public. In 1924, the Masquers began searching for a national honorary organization to join. As there was no truly national organization, Elinor B. Watson, Robert Sloan, and Fairmont faculty director Paul F. Opp researched forming such a national organization.</font></p>
<p style=""""><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">As a result of their research and work, a proposed national constitution was drawn up, and, on August 12, 1925, the first cast of Alpha Psi Omega members, drawn from the Masquers, was initiated. It was then decided that each chapter was to be called a ""cast,"" and Fairmont College became the Alpha Cast. Soon after, Marshall College in Huntington, West Virginia, expressed interest in chartering a cast of Alpha Psi Omega; they founded the Beta Cast. A member from Huntington suggested the name ""Playbill"" for the national magazine, which was thereafter adopted.</font></p>
<p style=""""><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">Throughout the country, Alpha Psi Omega has sponsored the formation of theatre honor societies in high schools and junior colleges, with the aim of encouraging dramatic production at every step in a person's academic career. In 1929, after significant interest on the junior college level, Delta Psi Omega was formed. In 1936, at the Alpha Psi Omega Grand Rehearsal, Delta Psi Omega was officially recognized as the junior college division of Alpha Psi Omega. Today, there are over 350 Delta Psi Omega casts.</font></p>
<p style=""""><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">Alpha Psi Omega has enjoyed continuous national growth and, with over 600 casts, is the largest national honor society in America. Colleges and universities of recognized standing, having an established theatre program or theatre club for the purpose of producing plays, will be eligible for membership.</font></p>

Along with doing tons of fundraisers, they're creating this IndieGoGo to reach out to donors off campus. 



What We Need & What You Get
To put up an amazing formal, this pledge cast needs $500. The money will go directly to putting up the best formal Millikin's Alpha Psi Omega has ever seen. With the theme being ""A Night At The Tonys,"" the money will go to the purchase of food, decorations, party favors, and the ingredients for mocktails. 

Any money not put toward the formal will go directly to Alpha Psi Omega's service programs and helping bring guest artists to Millikin.

With the small donation of $10 dollars you get a complimentary ticket to this formal event. But donating what ever amount of funds you can, from $1 to $500, helps these pledges put up this formal and helps Alpha Psi Omega bring and do great things for the Millikin University campus and Decatur community.

History of Who We Are (Alpha Psi Omega)
In the early twentieth century, interest in the dramatic arts grew tremendously on college and university campuses. By 1920, most colleges had a dramatic organization staging plays annually for the campus and the community at large. Also around this time, little theatre productions and dramatic workshops began taking place. This furthered the interest in theatre on campuses everywhere, especially in the western part of the country. At this time, several honororary groups were formed to recognize and reward exemplary student participation in those productions.
In 1921, at Fairmont State College in Fairmont, West Virginia, college theater took root. A faculty director was hired in 1923, and the Masquers were formed. The Masquers were charged with presenting a season of 4 to 5 major productions per year for students and the general public. In 1924, the Masquers began searching for a national honorary organization to join. As there was no truly national organization, Elinor B. Watson, Robert Sloan, and Fairmont faculty director Paul F. Opp researched forming such a national organization.
As a result of their research and work, a proposed national constitution was drawn up, and, on August 12, 1925, the first cast of Alpha Psi Omega members, drawn from the Masquers, was initiated. It was then decided that each chapter was to be called a ""cast,"" and Fairmont College became the Alpha Cast. Soon after, Marshall College in Huntington, West Virginia, expressed interest in chartering a cast of Alpha Psi Omega; they founded the Beta Cast. A member from Huntington suggested the name ""Playbill"" for the national magazine, which was thereafter adopted.
Throughout the country, Alpha Psi Omega has sponsored the formation of theatre honor societies in high schools and junior colleges, with the aim of encouraging dramatic production at every step in a person's academic career. In 1929, after significant interest on the junior college level, Delta Psi Omega was formed. In 1936, at the Alpha Psi Omega Grand Rehearsal, Delta Psi Omega was officially recognized as the junior college division of Alpha Psi Omega. Today, there are over 350 Delta Psi Omega casts.
Alpha Psi Omega has enjoyed continuous national growth and, with over 600 casts, is the largest national honor society in America. Colleges and universities of recognized standing, having an established theatre program or theatre club for the purpose of producing plays, will be eligible for membership.



Our Mission

The
purpose of this, the Omega Xi Cast of Alpha Psi Omega, is to stimulate interest
in dramatic activity at Millikin University, to secure to the college all the
advantages and mutual helpfulness provided by a large national honorary
fraternity, and by electing student to membership, serving as an honor for
their efforts in theatre while at Millikin University. In addition, Alpha Psi
Omega strives to bring quality theatre to the Decatur Community, as well as to
our own scholastic home. Our motto â€œseek a life useful,â€ is executed through
bringing our knowledge of theatre to others.

He has simply stopped communicating at all, and we are very, very worried about him. Still, for Sylvani, the show must go on!  We are hoping this wonderful man will contact us to let her know what happened, but even if he doesn't, she needs to go to her summer Intensive--this time she has chosen Texas Ballet Theater, which has offered her 90% tuition scholarship!  But there are many more expenses to get her there. So we are coming to you once again for help.Please read her new campaign, Help Sylvani Dance 2.0, here!
Here's a picture of Sylvani in Oregon Ballet Academy's Spring Concert: 
Our Story
What makes Sylvani Dance?  Love! To Sylvani, Love=DanceI'm Sylvani's mother. Since she was 3, Sylvani has wanted to “be a ballerina”. What little girl doesn’t? Most take a few classes, wear a tutu for awhile whenever they can, and change their minds later.  But she is now nearly 13, and I have never known anyone so dedicated. Still loving ballet profoundly, dance has been her favorite thing to do for 9 years, no matter how much work, no matter how many hours a week.  Sylvani says when life is hard and overwhelming, the one thing that helps her is dance class.  She says she ""forgets everything else, lets the music fill her, and just dances"".  So even when the steps are difficult, her pointe shoes hurt, or she is tired after a full day of school and dance class, she wants more. Everyone who sees Sylvani dance can see the gift she has, and comments on her talent. 


Sylvani's Got ""It""! 
Sylvani has had many blessings in her life: 


Serendipity to have John Grensback (NYC Ballet, Joffrey Ballet, and principal with the Houston Ballet) and his wife Megan Murphy (Houston Ballet), open the Oregon Ballet Academy just as Sylvani was ready to begin her training.  There is no better school for developing her talents in a spirit of support and cooperation, combined with all the professional knowledge to bring young students to their highest level. Their motto is ""Serious Dance. Serious Fun!"" Sylvani has been working with John as her primary ballet teacher since she was 6, and at the school since she was 3.

Destiny to have one grandmother who danced and still teaches dance, and the other grandmother, of Romanian Jewish heritage, who passed on her graceful lithe beauty.  It's in her genes! She has the talent and the ""look"". 

Kismet that each of Sylvani's parents also have musical talent and training that allowed us to recognize Sylvani's musicality from birth.  Sylvani has always had our support and we are determined to help her take this as far as she wishes to go! 

John Grensback says, she ""has all the ingredients""--talent, musicality, the right look, and love.  From a man who danced under such ballet phenomes as George Ballanchine and Robert Joffrey, this is high praise and predictive of Sylvani's chances for success.  
The Next Step.  Moving to pre-professional level training...Each summer, many ballet companies around the world offer summer dance intensives for serious students wishing to improve their form, round out their training, and maybe find their way into a company one day. This year, Sylvani auditioned for the Summer Dance Lab at Whitman College in Walla Walla, WA, the oldest such intensive in the country, and the American Ballet Theater Summer Intensive.  The audition tours go all around the country, auditioning thousands of students.  Since she is so young, and it was her first time auditioning, in a highly competitive environment against older and more experienced ballet students, we thought this would just be a good ""trial run"" to help her learn to audition. We were thrilled when she opened her response emails from BOTH and was accepted!  After careful consideration, Sylvani has decided that the 2-week Summer Dance Lab at Whitman College is best for her first experience.  

The Biggest Challenge...What else? $$$
These programs cost much more than our family can afford.  The Summer Dance Lab costs $2397 for tuition, room and board, plus transportation and other costs estimated at $1000 to get her there and back. I am supporting a whole family on one income, including many costs for two college students, Sylvani's older sisters. While I would happily do so if it were possible, I just can't afford to pay for this myself.
Will You Help Please?Sylvani has worked so hard to achieve her dream and shows so much promise!  Dance is the most important thing in her life. I don't want to see her miss this chance because I am unable to afford it. So, we are turning to you, our friends and family, patrons of dance and the performing arts, and supporters of dreams of all kinds! 
Just think how you will feel when, one day, you see Sylvani on a major dance stage and know that you helped get her there!
 
The Goal= $3000All money earned through this campaign will go directly towards the tuition ($1389), the administrative fee ($35) and housing ($973) costs for Summer Dance Lab, as well as transportation costs (estimated at $1000) to get her there and back. Sylvani actually needs $3397 to meet the projected costs, but to make it easier to reach our goal, and have more of your money go to her project, we set the amount here at $3000. Please feel free to donate more. If she raises more than she needs, we will put any additional funds into a ""dance support"" account for Sylvani's future dance needs, such as leotards, shoes (one pair of pointe shoes costs $85), and additional classes. We aren't stopping here. We are also approaching local businesses for donations, holding a garage sale, and possibly putting on a dance benefit. 
(Just in case this campaign doesn't meet it's goal, any money will still be kept in a fund to help Sylvani attend extra summer classes closer to home)
Your donation will all go to Sylvani's dance education.
Check out the great perks Sylvani is offering! When Sylvani danced for her godfather and godmother's wedding, their photographer, Roots, took this beautiful photo of her. Sylvani's Uncle Lawrence, a graphic designer, made it into an 11""x17"" poster. (Printing services donated by Premier Press, in Portland, OR).
If you donate $30 or more, Sylvani will send you a signed copy of this poster as a thank you gift. 


Other Ways You Can Help
The best other way you can help, after you donate of course, is to spread the word!!!  Tell your friends about Sylvani, and ask if they would like to help a young girl reach her dream of becoming a professional ballerina.  They could be contributing to the next great ballet star!  You can easily ""share"" that you donated by using the tools on this site.  Post the link on your Facebook page!  Put it on your friends' walls!  Send a Tweet!  And remember the power of positive thinking!  Go to see a ballet and visualize Sylvani dancing on that stage and that you are helping her get there!",7.0,0,"13 Campaigns

<p>Getting accepted into a prestigious festival like NYMF is only the first step.  Developing and producing a theater project has certain fixed costs.  For example, the substantial fee that NYMF requires you to pay, as well as technical and material needs (theater costs, equipment, sets, lighting, costumes, mics, etc.).  Many people who have been passionate about my project have alread starting working by donating their time.  However, the director, actors, company manager, stage crew, lighting / sound guys, projectionists, etc. all need to be paid.  There are 3 workshop performances happening at NYMF: Wednesday, July 11th at 8pm, Saturday July 14th at 10:30pm, and Sunday July, 15th at 4:30pm. </p>

<p>$2000 is the minimum I'm asking for in order to cover the cost of traveling and living expenses while I am in Sweden saving the poor Swiss from their doom.  A super human such as myself needs to sleep somewhere to recharge and knock the Swedes dead just by walking down the street. I must eat, because by boobs and booty don't jiggle on air alone. I need to get to and from each destination with ease as well, I'm a warrior princess, you don't expect me to walk do you? And once I'm done in Sweden, I head over to London and Paris where I plot and scheme on how to break in to their system and try to take over their performance scene. It should be relatively easy, as I'm sure once the press gets a hold of what I will do for Stockholm, there will be no stopping me. </p>
<p><b>FAQ's</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What if you make more than the $2000?</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> - My fairy godmother who made this trip all possible needs to be reimbursed the cost of that rather expensive airfare. And if there's anything after that, well I'm a super hero warrior princess performance artist. I often like to change my shell, and do more amazing tricks that change the world through my art. It will go to good use. And you will see the play by play on it.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Are you saying that if you don't perform in this showcase, that the Stockholm Fest will be deprived and not have good talent?</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> - No! What I'm saying is is that without me the entire Stockholm is doomed! Stockholm's Black population according to once source, is .8%. This is like a one Black boob giggle factor happening like every ten years. I will be the first..okay so I don't know about the first, but I'm the only this year and that's all that matters. Don't deprive the country of it's basic need to see my pastie covered boobs and my Black bottom in a g-string, repping for the Black Goddess herself, The Hottentot Venus. Do you really want me not to make history on top of leaving these people without the sight of my smooth chocolate flesh? I DIDN'T THINK SO! So kindly donate. :-D</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The perks you get will be AMAZING!!! And make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. From private performances, to glamorous photos that you can hang on your wall to brighten your day, to burlesque classes! How could you not want to contribute to this campaign knowing that there is a possibility that Akynos will be grateful and you helped save a part of the country with the world's eighth highest per capita income???? Like not helping me get there could completely devastate them and their resources. Don't let them go out like that. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>Funding performance dreams can be challenging due to the stigma put on bodies that are seen as explicit; women and Black bodies and movement. Especially those with a performance style that does not qualify as high art. By contributing you could help Akynos take over the world! Help her bring the beauty of Black stripteasing history to Europe. So much of Black performance history has been eliminated from history, as well as the images and history of many of the burlesque queens that helped contribute to the history of this rich art. </span></span><p>Your contribution also helps the community abroad witness that ""classic"" burlesque is not just limited to the slow striptease or Western aesthetic of disrobing. But be impacted with the knowledge of a long history Black bodies have had in burlesque with sometimes fast movements and stories in Black history.</p>
<p>Aaaaand, need I say it again? You save the country from an All White Stripper syndrome. One that has plagued burlesque stages for far too long, in too many places. So donate a dollar. Save the Swiss. Show a Black breast.</p>

What if you make more than the $2000? - My fairy godmother who made this trip all possible needs to be reimbursed the cost of that rather expensive airfare. And if there's anything after that, well I'm a super hero warrior princess performance artist. I often like to change my shell, and do more amazing tricks that change the world through my art. It will go to good use. And you will see the play by play on it.


Are you saying that if you don't perform in this showcase, that the Stockholm Fest will be deprived and not have good talent? - No! What I'm saying is is that without me the entire Stockholm is doomed! Stockholm's Black population according to once source, is .8%. This is like a one Black boob giggle factor happening like every ten years. I will be the first..okay so I don't know about the first, but I'm the only this year and that's all that matters. Don't deprive the country of it's basic need to see my pastie covered boobs and my Black bottom in a g-string, repping for the Black Goddess herself, The Hottentot Venus. Do you really want me not to make history on top of leaving these people without the sight of my smooth chocolate flesh? I DIDN'T THINK SO! So kindly donate. :-D



The perks you get will be AMAZING!!! And make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. From private performances, to glamorous photos that you can hang on your wall to brighten your day, to burlesque classes! How could you not want to contribute to this campaign knowing that there is a possibility that Akynos will be grateful and you helped save a part of the country with the world's eighth highest per capita income???? Like not helping me get there could completely devastate them and their resources. Don't let them go out like that. 


The Impact
Funding performance dreams can be challenging due to the stigma put on bodies that are seen as explicit; women and Black bodies and movement. Especially those with a performance style that does not qualify as high art. By contributing you could help Akynos take over the world! Help her bring the beauty of Black stripteasing history to Europe. So much of Black performance history has been eliminated from history, as well as the images and history of many of the burlesque queens that helped contribute to the history of this rich art. Your contribution also helps the community abroad witness that ""classic"" burlesque is not just limited to the slow striptease or Western aesthetic of disrobing. But be impacted with the knowledge of a long history Black bodies have had in burlesque with sometimes fast movements and stories in Black history.
Aaaaand, need I say it again? You save the country from an All White Stripper syndrome. One that has plagued burlesque stages for far too long, in too many places. So donate a dollar. Save the Swiss. Show a Black breast.



Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:

Tell your friends or others you know who are fans of live entertainment. URGE THEM to donate in your name and theirs. And be down with me for life.
Use hashtag #helpsavesweden on twitter and add me @akynos - spread the world! the Swiss needs me!
Come to one of my performances, and slide the money in my gstring. see here ---> http://ymlp.com/zZRfla

I'm a sex worker activist, spread the word to the groups you know. Post it to your sites and blogs! 
Even if the campaign has ended you can still logon to www.akynos.com and contribute there. Just click on the contact me option on the bottom left of the page.

individualistic, passionate antithesis to Reason, civility, and the myth of
perpetual progress. <br/>No final, didactically delivered conclusions here, but we’re

directly from the unique genius of his unfettered imagination. We’re smashing
that stale and more than a bit problematic formulation against a collaborative/ecological model: the powerful natural processes of birth and evolution, the simple
magnificence of biology at work. The result: a gallery of living physical/digital/embodied

Control Group but also Sweet Edge dance and several other truly righteous Denver

<br/><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong>

In addition, we are receiving an honorarium of $2,000 from The Public’s Under The Radar Festival. </p><p>This total of $12,000 is not enough to even pay the artists and technicians fair wages who will bring this show to life. The combined wages for all bodies hired for this project amounts to $14,715. The additional cost of set, costume, and lighting materials as well as transportation, contingency, and donation processing fees is $3,380, bringing us to a total of $18,095.

<h3>We've had such a fun time hosting a room party the last couple years, that we're back.</h3>
<h3>With this being the 20th anniversary of CONvergence, it had us strolling down the vestiges of our memories to 1999. There was a lot of craziness going on.</h3>

<p>We are the Earworm collective (Garrick/Liz/Maggie/Trish/Wade) and we've been attendees at CONvergence for the past 10 years (or so). We've hosted a party room the past 2 years, and this will be magical #3 (it is the magic number afterall). The more money we can raise, the more amenities the room can offer. There's party room rental, decorating, drinks, and more.</p>
<p>Luckily, in the future, nothing goes to waste, and due to our own lucrative investments in The Stuff company, drone technology, and appropriate handling of the wonderful tips from last year, we only need to raise about 1/3 of the cost to host a room.</p>
<p>Rough budget breakdown (will be tweaked as we go)</p>
<p>Cabana Room rental - $800</p>
<p>A brand new bar - $300</p>
<p>Decorations - $400</p>

<p>Flyers and Posters - $200</p>

<p>Last year we contracted with a local artist to come up with a logo for our room, He did an amazing job on the Earworm logo, and Singing Sandworm. This year he's graciously agreed to design a poster. </p>
<p>Also, what says 90's like pinback buttons? That's right, some of our donation levels include these wonderful buttons that you can attach to your lanyards. We're so excited to have a button making party!</p>
<p>Also, because it's an Earworm for many people, there might be a pop-up ""Hamilton"" sing-along during one of the convention days (Don't judge us too harshly on the timing. We know it's not from the new century but... timey wimey).</p>

<p>Hot Tramp's inaugural production is a new comedy by Hollis James (co-creator of the hit web series, <i>Teachers Lounge</i>), inspired by his knock-down-drag-out battle with drug addiction. It's about a guy named Jack, his friend Kyle, and Kyle's friend cocaine. Thanks to his new friends, Jack's life quickly begins to spiral out of control. He loses his job, his girlfriend, his health, and all sense of personal hygiene. Will Jack find the strength to get his life back on track or will Kyle ultimately win?</p>

But there is still a ton of stuff we're going to have to figure out how to pay for. Hopefully that's where you come in! </p>
<p>We need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay our actors </li>
<li>Pay our designers </li>
<li>Pay our stage manager</li>
<li>Hire a photographer to take press photos</li>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Eternal Theatre Collective is a youth not-for-profit organization dedicated to providing opportunities to young performing artists between the ages of 13 and 25. Too often young talent is overlooked in the performing arts world because they haven't gained enough real-world experience to book the work they need. We believe that young people are just as capable of creating amazing and beautiful theatre - especially when they collaborate with each other and learn from the process.</p>
<p>Everyone we work with, from the actors to the designers, the creative team to the managerial team and even the board of directors is under 25 years old. We offer fantastic opportunities for youth to experiment and grow in their craft in a professional and collaborative environment.</p>

<p><i>     ""A company like this is rare – I find most cast those who are recent graduates, have been in    the industry for years or (when necessary) children under 10 years of age.</i></p>
<p><i>     This is difficult for young artists in this industry as we are hired based off experience (not only talent), but what happens when you cannot find experience or roles that fit your age range? Eternal provides this. It does not matter the colour of your skin or your size: it is your personality and the character you bring to the show.""</i></p>
<p>          -Hailey Fowler, Choreographer for 13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The challenge with our work is that we don't have huge funding powers, which is why we always count on generous people like YOU to help us continue to create opportunities and make dreams a reality for young people in our community.</p>
<p>This summer, we're doing a musical with a rock score, so we really need microphones to be able to amplify the voices of our actors to be heard over the band. Renting microphones is an expensive task which is why we're asking YOU to help us reach our goal. With YOUR help, we can ensure that all the talented young actors in our production will have their voices heard loud and clear - and for many of them, it will be the first time that will happen on a professional stage.</p>

<p>  <i>""Growing up with dreams of working in ""big-city"" theatre, I am incredibly grateful to have the chance to work with ETC to turn my own ideas and designs into the sets for 13. I came to ETC with very little training and experience in set design and construction, but a strong interest in learning more and being able to put on an incredible show. 13 has given me and the other youths of ETC the chance to participate in a professional and constructive environment, where we can learn and showcase our skills for the thriving theatre community in Vancouver.""</i></p>

Experimentorium is looking for completion funding for its new production The Engagement.

Founded at RADA in 2017, Experimentorium is an award-winning film and theatre production company.
What we have
The Engagement tells the true story of how alcoholism tore apart a couple and their family. The play had a successful performance in Brighton and now Experimentorium are partnering with Steaming to bring the piece to London.
Initial support has been pledged by the Carne Trust.

What we need
In our latest film, Fragments, we interpreted our ideas through available locations and technology and the film has gone on to win awards in numerous international film festivals. In The Enemies (our most recent theatre production), we used real household waste as set-dressing to give more immediacy and recognisability to the political message. We engage with production limitations and make them work to our advantage, we know what we can do without and consequently, what we need. 
The campaign for The Engagement aims for £1,000 completion funding to cover some or all of:

Rehearsal space
Insurance
Stunt props 

These practical elements are the basic essentials needed to elevate the piece in a manner that is both safe and effective.
