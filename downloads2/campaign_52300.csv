any creative project, problems can arise throughout development that you can't

interactive and animation company Blue Arc Studios with the lead of Akçay
Karaazmak. We have already developed the main structure of the game. Now we
just need to create more and more ideas and put them into scenes. We have
decided build the game with the crowdfunding to spend all our energy just for the game. Crowdfunding speeds up development process.</p></div>","The Dark Inside Me, is a very unique psychological horror adventure game from a horror movie director Akçay Karaazmak, based on dynamic interactive scenario.
Game is 2d,5 next-gen and
unique 3rd person point & click psychological horror adventure game. Main
aim is to reflect the real characteristic of a player through the game and see
how far players would push their limits through the stages of game. Game is +18
and has disturbing gore, sex and intense violence scenes.



Game is based on a dynamic scenario and the game-flow changes according to player decisions and how they face with the situations and solve the puzzles. Puzzles can be solved with more then one way and each way will effect and change the rest of the gameplay.


Sometimes players has to give serious decisions which will completely affect the following game stages. And those decisions could be the reflection of the player’s real characteristic.

It’s said everyone has angels. One of
them leads us to the light and the other take us into dark. We give our own
decisions through the path of the life and now we’ll give our own decisions
through The Dark Inside Me.


Dark Inside Me is blurring the thin
line between madness and reality, darkness and light, love and hate, forgive
and vengeance.


You awake in
a hospital room, handcuffed to a bed. You hear some detectives speaking about
you. They are speaking that they are surprised that how you can be still alive
after that terrifying event. And one of the said it would be better if they
caught you dead. You don’t understand and don’t remember much but to learn
first you should find a way to escape. 

The first question come to minds is if
you are guilty or not? But its much more beyond the guiltiness or guiltless.
You have given a chance to face with your past and how far you would go and
sacrifice from yourself to enlighten the darkness and fight with your demons.





The Dark Inside Me gameplay builds upon the decisions and sacrifices between the user and the events. Puzzles in the game may solved with more then one way. And each way will lead you different ways and change the flow of the scenario. You can kill some one that stopping you from your way, by finding a tool to use on. Or you will find a way to pass him or her without killing. And if you didn't kill then that person could help you later in the game to solve a puzzle or can kill you or and make the things harder for you. When time comes for the vengeance, you will decide to forgive or no. You will torture or kill or let him or her go .You will face with the decisions you gave through the game. You take or find many tools and items, use them on other objects, combine them to create new items to solve new things.


Game is very synchronized with the
amazing sounds effects and music. It will take you into the game and make you
feel that you are the part of it.
Even the game is a point & click
adventure game, there will be some action scenes as well including torture,
fight and sex. 





For example; you start to play in indoor scenes and then continue outdoors then take a bus and play in the bus and then goto other places. Goto airport find a way to enter plane. Travel with plane and play in it. Then continue your journey in another country, search things and then travel to a town. You should find a way to enter a club and solve the puzzles. There will be also some fun scenes as well; for example you will play in a rock bar with a band. You’ll be the lead singer and guitarist on the stage. Sure this scene isn't designed just for fun, it’s a part of a puzzle.


Game always will bring you new things and surprises. It will always keep the tension up and let you to lead the game-flow and the events. The Dark Inside me, will push the limits to give you a unique experience and make it more then just a game.

programa televisivo que mezcla entrevistas y sketches cómicos. El
concepto “meter la pata” es el nexo entre ambos bloques. En las
entrevistas, la persona que presente el programa conversará con una
persona conocida por la audiencia y otra desconocida por los
espectadores. Los sketches desarrollarán situaciones verosímiles
ideadas por nuestro guionista, quien para su creación ha partido de
experiencias tanto ficticias como reales.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Las entrevistas se harán
en una localización interior, preferiblemente un plató. El
conductor del espacio mantendrá una actitud respetuosa y cordial con
los invitados. El deseo es que el entrevistado conocido pase un buen
rato en la grabación, promocionando además su actualidad
profesional, y que el espectador disfrute con la cercanía del
invitado; en cuanto al entrevistado desconocido, la intención es que
pase un rato ameno en la grabación, compartiendo sus vivencias con
la audiencia y conociendo a un rostro popular. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Los sketches tendrán una
estética naturalista y una puesta en escena más cercana al cine que
al clásico sketch televisivo. Para dar vida a los diferentes
personajes contamos con un solvente reparto fijo, al que cada edición
se sumará un artista invitado.

presentación, que puedes ver al inicio de la página, hemos
tenido el inmenso placer de contar con el apoyo de los músicos Dani

“Tierra
Trágame” es un programa televisiu per a tots els públics que
barreja entrevistes i sketchos còmics. El concepte “Ficar la pota”
és el nexe entre ambdós blocs. Amb una durada total de 40 minuts.
En les entrevistes, la persona que presenta el programa conversarà
amb una persona coneguda per l’audiència i una altre desconeguda
pels espectadors. Els sketchos desenvoluparan situacions vera símils
ideades pel nostre guionista Jordi Cantavella, autor de quinze
llibres com <i>Em
vull fondre 100 ficades de peus a la galleda glorioses, El Brigadista</i>
i la biografia d´Albert Llovera <i>No
Límits</i>,
qui per la seva creació ha partit d’experiències tan fictícies
com reals.</p>
<p>
Per donar vida als
diferents personatges contem amb un solvent repartiment fix, que
desvetllarem poc a poc, al que cada edició s’hi sumarà un artista
convidat.</p>
<p>
Les
entrevistes es faran en una localització interior, preferiblement un
plató. El conductor de l´espai mantindrà una actitud respectuosa i
cordial amb els convidats. El desig es que l´entrevistat conegut
passi una bona estona en la gravació, promocionant a més la seva
actualitat professional, i que l´espectador disfruti de la
proximitat del convidat; en quant a l´entrevistat desconegut, la
intenció és que passi una estona amena en la gravació, compartint
les seves vivències amb l´audiència i coneixent un rostre popular.

</p>
<p>
Els sketchos tindran una
estètica naturalista i una posada en escena més propera al cine que
al clàssic sketch televisiu. Per donar vida als diferents
personatges contem amb un solvent repartiment fix, que desvetllarem
poc a poc, al que cada edició s’hi sumarà un artista convidat.</p>

SPQRally è il nome che abbiamo scelto per il nostro team in partenza il prossimo 19 luglio. SPQRally non è solo questo ma anche la nostra idea di viaggio, l'avventura  dalla quale nascerà il documentario che racconterà com'è andata veramente. Nessun percorso definito, nessun supporto, nessun'assistenza. La nostra vita non sarà più come prima, figuriamoci la macchina. What is SPQRally?

SPQRally is the name we chose for our team departing on 19th July.
SPQRally is not only that but also our idea of traveling, the adventure from which will be born the documentary that will tell what really happened.
No defined path, no support, no assistance.Our life will never be as before. Neither the car.
Puoi fare la differenzaEquipaggiamento, viveri e rullini fotografici? Non solo a questo servirà il tuo contributo.Il tuo aiuto è di fondamentale importanza per raggiungere un importo da devolvere ad un'associazione romana che sceglieremo insieme a te, sulla base delle tue proposte. Abbiamo bisogno della massima partecipazione e dei tuoi suggerimenti per realizzare tutto questo.Il nostro progetto è portare Roma nel mondo, ma soprattutto far crescere il mondo dentro Roma. You can make a difference
Equipment, supplies and photographic films? Your contribution will be used not only for that.
Your help is crucial to reach an amount of money to be donated to a Roman association that we will choose with you, with the help of your suggestions. We need maximum participation and you to make this happen.
Our project is to bring Rome around in the world, but especially to grow the world inside of Rome.

Di cosa abbiamo bisogno?Abbiamo fissato come obiettivo il raggiungimento di una somma pari a 10000€, circa 0,77 centesimi di euro a chilometro.Dove andranno i tuoi fondi? A cominciare dal veicolo in uso, benzina, equipaggiamento vario e pezzi di ricambio, viveri, tende e sacchi a pelo, visti, permessi e tutto quello che di imprevisto può nascere in circa 13000 km di viaggio.Raggiunta la soglia minima? Sarai tu a suggerirci cosa fare con il resto dei fondi raccolti, indicandoci chi credi abbia davvero bisogno del nostro aiuto e chi ritieni più meritevole della nostra beneficenza.
Se non dovessimo riuscire a raccogliere tutta la somma per intero, ma almeno il necessario a partire ed a girare per te questo documentario unico nel suo genere, l'SPQRally partirà e affronterà ugualmente questa avventura.Se, invece, tutto ciò non sarà possibile, la totalità dei fondi già raccolti sarà comunque devoluta in beneficenza, per non lasciare vano lo sforzo di chi in questo progetto ha creduto veramente. What do we need?We have set as our goal to achieve a sum of € 10,000, about 0.77 cents per kilometer.But how will your funds be really used?

<p>Buying the house was supposed to be a dream come true. But for Drew and Kara Townsend the nightmare has just begun.</p>
<p>Drew’s responsibilities as a dailies editor in Hollywood means he works nights while his wife – a nurse – works with the elderly during the day. But neither really ever seem to be home alone. When Drew wakes up paralyzed by an unseen force, his wife mentions that sleep paralysis is fairly common, and almost always includes feeling like an evil being is present.</p>
<p>Drew decides to power through the nightmares, and chalks it all up to a figment of his sleep paralysis. But Kara is experiencing something too, and she begins to question if it’s all in their heads, or if something sinister is watching them sleep.</p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Need </h3>
<div><p>Allow us to start with a declarative statement: This film
is happening. Now we need YOUR help to make it the best experience possible. </p></div>
<div>
<p>As a startup production house, we are very fortunate to have
some private backing as well as myriad connections within the industry. More
than anything, we need permits and legal protection in order to do this
properly. Aside from the cost of operations, we also believe that actors and
artists should be paid for their work. Art is not a ""great networking
opportunity"" or a ""chance for exposure."" Art is passion-turned-obsession
and ultimately a life's work. This is a job. 
Industry standard also requires that we feed the cast and crew, and hey,
who doesn’t like food, right? Finally, we’d like to sink a little money into
special effects and higher-caliber effects make up. Hey, I know a guy, ya know?
We have the knowledge, and the connections, we just need your help with the funding. Our
locations are secure, our actors and crew signed on and are chomping to get
started,  and we own about half of the equipment
we need thanks to our investors. The Figment is just the first of several films
on the slate. </p>
<p>Essentially it breaks down like this:</p>

</h3>
</div><div> <p></p>
<p>We are fortunate to live in the digital age. Our horror film
hopes to bring better understanding of sleep paralysis and sleep disorders in
general. We also hope to frighten you immensely along the way. Sleep paralysis
is a little understood condition in which a person wakes from sleep unable to
move. Often times it is accompanied by the feeling of a terrible presence in
the room. Call them ghosts. Call them demons. Over the centuries, the condition
has given rise to myths and legends including The Old Hag, The Incubus and
Succubus legends, and according to some researchers, even the widely-known
alien form, The Greys. But it's more than legend to those afflicted. True fear
doesn't live out in the shadows, or in vampire's castles, or in werewolves'
dens. True fear lives in your own bedroom, stands beside you while you sleep,
watches you squirm in pain and panic, and dreams of stealing your very soul. Upon
completion of the film, we hope the awareness of sleep paralysis can help lead
to better treatments, a little bit of peace - before it's too late. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Gamble</h3> <p></p>
<p>There are risks to any investment, but make no mistake -
this film is going to happen. We already have enough resource to make it, we
just need your help to make it even better. You can think of us like that new
Chinese restaurant in town. You know how Generals Tso's chicken tastes, but
what if that new place makes it the best you've ever had? You're going to spend
money on dinner anyway, why not get dinner somewhere new?</p>
<p>We are committed to making the best possible product - like
any business, and we will do our best to serve your twisted, psychotic
impulses. On film anyhow.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, when you get to work, ask your co-workers how they're
doing. And if they say they didn't sleep well, ask them why - and then listen -
really listen to why. Maybe they'll confide in you. Maybe you'll make a new
friend. Maybe you'll help them relieve a burden, such as waking up in the
middle of the night to find creatures scratching at their door, or a horned-demon
resting against the vanity. </p>

<h3><b><u>What We
Need &amp; What You Get</u></b></h3>
<p>Now, Paranormal Central has an opportunity
to take the next step and take their talk show to television. People from all
walks of life have had encounters with the paranormal: rock stars, celebrities,
police officers, military personnel… Let’s get them on the couch and hear their
real-life stories. It’ll be a one-hour show that you won’t want to end. </p>
<p>When Jeffrey Gonzalez approached KMPH FOX 26 with their pilot for Paranormal Central, they immediately liked it and
offered to run it on their station. With the first
episode produced, KMPH FOX 26 recommended that producing 26 episodes would keep the project fresh all year long! While the
first 8 episodes were already budgeted for, the remaining 18 episodes were not.

Paranormal Central: TV Series to
stream online!
In addition to airing on TV, the
Paranormal Central: TV series will now stream online as well. This is a huge
deal for our international audience who've pointed out that without the ability
to see the show online, there's no way for them to ever see the new
programming. 
Each episode of Paranormal Central
that airs on TV will be made available online to stream the same day.
Please share this information and the campaign on social
media, and consider contributing today!----------------------------------------------
About the ShowParanormal Central is the #1 paranormal
show on both Livestream and Art Bell’s
Dark Matter Network. This internet
talk show unearths the truth behind the mysteries and conspiracies of the supernatural
and extraterrestrial. 
Host and founder of the Sanger Paranormal
Society, Jeffrey Gonzalez, is not just a talk show host. He's an investigator.
Investigating the paranormal for over 10 years across the globe, he has found a
way to show his discoveries to the world! 
After being #1 on the Internet for so
long, Paranormal Central is now ready to become #1 on syndicated television.
Who’s
Involved
Behind every great show is an even greater
team collaborating together to make it happen. This collection of individuals
and groups are what will make this show truly an unbeatable success and help
this show rise to the top.
Jeffrey
GonzalezFounder of Paranormal Central and the Sanger Paranormal Society. You may have
seen him on several TV shows like Monsters
and Mystery's in America on the
Discovery Channel, Chasing UFOs on
National Geographic, or on several news stories around the world. College Humor even did a skit with
Jeffrey on the topic of the paranormal. 
Allen
ThomasThe co-host of Paranormal Central and part of the investigation team. Allen actually
saw a Bigfoot in 1987. His knowledge in the Occult and Religion brings a whole
new twist to the show. Possessed
TranquilityThe house band for Paranormal Central is an electronic, alternative rock band
formed in 2012 by lead singer/programmer, Anthony, and guitarist, Kaylie. Both
were solo artists that chose to combine their talents in digital creating,
composition, writing, and production. Possessed Tranquility has shared the
stage with the likes of Orgy, Wes Borland’s Black Light Burns, and many others.
Their debut single, “Hear You Calling,” won the award for Best Song from
Akademia Music. 
What We
Need & What You Get
Now, Paranormal Central has an opportunity
to take the next step and take their talk show to television. People from all
walks of life have had encounters with the paranormal: rock stars, celebrities,
police officers, military personnel… Let’s get them on the couch and hear their
real-life stories. It’ll be a one-hour show that you won’t want to end. 
When Jeffrey Gonzalez approached KMPH FOX 26 with their pilot for Paranormal Central, they immediately liked it and
offered to run it on their station. With the first
episode produced, KMPH FOX 26 recommended that producing 26 episodes would keep the project fresh all year long! While the
first 8 episodes were already budgeted for, the remaining 18 episodes were not.


This is
where you come in.We know that when Paranormal Central hits the FOX Network, it’ll be a
hit. However, we need your help covering the
remaining production costs to film the entire first season of the show. This includes, but is not limited to, studio costs, film crew, guest
accommodations, on-location filming, post-production and distribution. Check out the side panel
to the right to check out all the unique perks we offer when you choose to give
today! 
We Need
Your Help!
If our monetary goal isn’t reached, a couple things
can happen:
1. 
We could miss this rare
opportunity with the FOX Network, which may or may not arise again in the
future
2. 
We would have to sell part of the
show to a third-party investor, giving up our creative control over the direction
of the show
Neither of which we want.
This show is and has always been for our fans and
paranormal enthusiasts worldwide. The only way for us to maintain that
integrity is if we produce this show together. By making a donation, you can become a part
of the show’s history.

<h3>Regicide: The Tale</h3>
<p>At it's core, Regicide, is a story. It is a story that has woken me up in the middle of the night, interrupted me at work, and whispered to me in my dreams. It's a love story between me and a world that started over two years ago. The engine is now complete. It is finally time for the game itself to be created and shared with the world.</p>
<p>Regicide: Tale of the Forgotten Thief explores a multitude of themes, both current and timeless. When playing Regicide, gamers will encounter and explore themes such as amnesia, family conflict, privilege, ethics, a police state, etc. </p>
<p>Gaming is my passion. And, I've been an innovator in the industry before: I worked on a game called ""Dungeon Overlord"" which brought German-style tabletop gaming to Facebook.</p>

<p><b>AND WHY IT MATTERS...</b></p>
<p>This project for us is not only about being able to create and express ourselves as artists, but also to make accessible to the general public this amazing knowledge that somehow is hidden from us. </p>
<p><b>Ley Lines, Sacred Geometry,  Submerged Pyramids</b>... When we started researching for the series, we were amazed at how so many historical facts are not being told. How so many wonderful information are not part of our everyday lives...</p>
<p>Yes, we could write a blog or a book.  But what if we could make a series, an entertaining series and at the same time, talk about all this information? We could change the World! :) </p>
<p>That's ""Alesia: Ground Zero"".  That's our series.</p>

<p>To make a series, with compelling visuals and professional artists involved, we need money. Of course, the more we have, the better the production quality, but we decided to start little by little. And as you can see with the images we got in France, we can really achieve a high production value with a small amount of money. </p>
<p>So for now, with this amount, we will pay the <b>production/filming</b> of the series.</p>
<p><b>Actors, Crew, Locations, Costumes and Set, Light Equipment, Camera, Lenses and -- food</b>... A hungry crew is an unhappy crew.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">                      </span></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are paying the minimum of the minimum and most of the actors involved are donating their time because they love the project. </span></p>
<p>Among them, besides Emiliano and I, is the actor <b>Steve Tom</b>. He is an accomplished American actor with numerous credits in films and television. His latest work was with <b>Jim Carrey on ""Dumb &amp; Dumber To"".</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>

<p></p>
<p>And if we don't reach our entire goal, we will use what we raised to finish editing the scenes we have in France and use it to show investors. But you know, this is a long and riskier way. That's why we need your contribution, so that we, together, have the power to make it happen.  No more gatekeepers! <br/></p>

<p>Our major challenge is, of course, to eventually be seen. There are so many web series around the Globe that get lost on the Internet... </p>
<p>That's why we did our research and we know there are thousands, if not millions of people interested in the subjects we will be talking about. We will reach out to these people. We will share our series on Blogs, Sites, Newspapers and Magazines. For this, we will hire a PR Firm to help us.</p>
<p>Also, we already have a Distributor in France interested in our series. Once it's produced, of course. They are the the company behind the European distribution of Brian Singer's web series ""H+"".</p>
<p>So we know our work will be seen by a considerable audience. Your contribution will not be in vain.  </p>

The line between present and future gets blurrier than ever and she finds herself involved in an Ancient conspiracy.


Created by actors/producers Larissa Vereza and Emiliano Ruschel ""Alesia"" has as a background Ancient Knowledge, Secret Societies and much more.  ""The DaVince Code"" mystery with the adventures of ""Indiana Jones"". A very interesting project, but it would need more time and money since the series is intended to be filmed around the world. 
So, as we are really passionate and really believe in this project, we decided to create a prequel: ""Alesia: Ground Zero"".  A 10 episode original streaming series where we will use some of the characters but with a different story. A story of how everything begins with 15 minutes per episode.
That's the project we are asking help to fund.







This First Season will be divided between France and Los Angeles and with our own investment, we already shot all the sequences in France.  
And now, for the Los Angeles part, we would love to have your support!




Different from France, where you can shoot in amazing locations for free (Eiffel Tower, Louvre, etc), Los Angeles is a very expensive city. 


AND WHY IT MATTERS...
This project for us is not only about being able to create and express ourselves as artists, but also to make accessible to the general public this amazing knowledge that somehow is hidden from us. 
Ley Lines, Sacred Geometry,  Submerged Pyramids... When we started researching for the series, we were amazed at how so many historical facts are not being told. How so many wonderful information are not part of our everyday lives...
Yes, we could write a blog or a book.  But what if we could make a series, an entertaining series and at the same time, talk about all this information? We could change the World! :) 
That's ""Alesia: Ground Zero"".  That's our series.

                           
A recent study
estimated that film and television productions in California alone produce 8 400 000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. 
It's our responsibility as individuals and artists to reduce our carbon
footprint, so we compromise ourselves to go Green on the Set of Alesia: Ground Zero. 







                                            Some of our guidelines:








Purchase or rent wardrobe from environmentally preferable sources (i.e.: certified organic materials, second-hand clothing and accessorie)


Use rechargeable batteries;


Aim to use washable plates and cups;  


and many more... 









To make a series, with compelling visuals and professional artists involved, we need money. Of course, the more we have, the better the production quality, but we decided to start little by little. And as you can see with the images we got in France, we can really achieve a high production value with a small amount of money. 
So for now, with this amount, we will pay the production/filming of the series.
Actors, Crew, Locations, Costumes and Set, Light Equipment, Camera, Lenses and -- food... A hungry crew is an unhappy crew.                      

                                                          

                       
We are paying the minimum of the minimum and most of the actors involved are donating their time because they love the project. 
Among them, besides Emiliano and I, is the actor Steve Tom. He is an accomplished American actor with numerous credits in films and television. His latest work was with Jim Carrey on ""Dumb & Dumber To"".



And if we don't reach our entire goal, we will use what we raised to finish editing the scenes we have in France and use it to show investors. But you know, this is a long and riskier way. That's why we need your contribution, so that we, together, have the power to make it happen.  No more gatekeepers! 
SCHEDULE:
* Scenes in France were already shot

We know we can make a compelling series. We just need your support to make it happen!



Our major challenge is, of course, to eventually be seen. There are so many web series around the Globe that get lost on the Internet... 
That's why we did our research and we know there are thousands, if not millions of people interested in the subjects we will be talking about. We will reach out to these people. We will share our series on Blogs, Sites, Newspapers and Magazines. For this, we will hire a PR Firm to help us.
Also, we already have a Distributor in France interested in our series. Once it's produced, of course. They are the the company behind the European distribution of Brian Singer's web series ""H+"".
So we know our work will be seen by a considerable audience. Your contribution will not be in vain.  




But if you can't contribute, that's okay! We totally understand! 
We would really appreciate if you can spread the word... 
If you are excited with this project, help us by sharing this campaign with your friends and family! 
Just share it by using the Indiegogo share tools!
 And that's all for now! We will be posting updates as we go along! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO SUPPORT US! IT MEANS THE WORLD TO US!",33.0,2,"1 Campaign

About a year ago I wanted a way to make my artwork and pictures stand out from the crowd. I wanted to illuminate my images but didn’t want to have to run cables and plug them in, I also didn’t want to have to switch them on and off, I wanted an illuminated picture frame that would work automatically, have a long battery life and be no bigger than a standard picture frame.

I named the product the illuminAte and started designing a range of personalised and non-personalised versions. During 2014 I designed and build a website named iLightUpWhenYouMove.com, took the pictures to various art and craft markets and events and started selling them online and found that they were proving very popular and that people loved the idea.  
  After a year of product testing and my own thoughts on how I could evolve the idea I designed the illuminAte FRAMETM. Using the same motion-activated principle, the FRAMETM is a blank picture frame no larger than a standard frame measuring 42cmx32cmx3.2cm, in which you can insert your own image up to size A4. 


In January this year I attended the Top Drawer retail exhibition and received an enormous amount of interest from numerous retailers including Fenwicks and Photobox. With this level of interest I have been encouraged to expand my hobby business into a full retail business and for that I need your help. In order to sell these unique gifts through traditional retail channels I need to get the build cost down as so far each picture has to be hand made.
The next steps...
So far I’ve done everything on my own from product design and testing, to brand and website design and build, to running market stalls and retail exhibitions. For the business to continue I need to accept that I can’t do everything myself, and so I need help.

What do I need?
I need to set up for mass production in order to reduce the production cost and be able to offer at a profit through retail outlets.Additionally I need to expand my online marketing in order to raise awareness and increase sales.To do all of this I need to employ (at least in a part time capacity) some help with the day to day running on the company while I set up for mass production.I have a Patent pending for the design and community design rights for all our designs.TimescaleAs soon as my target is reached I will be able to initiate mass-production which should take between 8-12 weeks. At the same time I will invest in online marketing and be in a position to promote the product to high street retailers.PerksAs perks I am offering a pre-order of an actual FRAME as soon as we get them into production, in black/white or natural wood at the estimated retail price of £50. I'm also offering a minor donation entitling you to a 10% discount when the FRAMEs are available.In addition, I'm offering a several of our current hand-made range of motion-activated illuminated pictures, which if payed for via Paypal will be delivered before the end of the campaign usually within 7-10 days.I will be adding  other products from the current hand made range as the campaign runs, but if there's something from our main site www.ilightupwhenyoumove.com that you really like please feel free to contact me and I'll arrange for a discount.Hope you like both the current ranger and the FRAME and with your help I hope to be able to sell them to a much wider market in the near future.Many thanks                                                                                                                      These product is self-contained, battery powered and does not require external wiring.Can be used as a motion-activated nightlight.Wall or desk/shelf mounted.Battery life: 1-6 months depending on usage.Please note the product requires 3xAA batteries.Measures 25cmx25cmx4cm.© 2015 DisenoUK Ltd.",13.0,1,"1 Campaign

<div>...centers around Andie, a woman in the midst of a very personal journey that has entered a very dark time--her thirties.  She's just ended a relationship, moved to a city she doesn't like for a job she loathes, and is facing family pressure to fall in line and do what women, according to her mother, are inherently supposed to do--marry and have children.  She's taken the path less traveled thus far, and while taking stock of the lives of the people around her who are seemingly thriving and are fulfilled, hers has stalled in this desolate place near rock bottom.  What we don't know is behind the scenes, Andie is struggling to deal with her inner-conflict surrounding a secret she's been keeping from everyone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>The Location:  Portland</h3>
<div>Portland has served as home to both Director Charlie Vaughn, and Executive Producer/Writer/Actress Julie Kristine Sullivan.  Both Charlie and Julie relocated to Portland from Los Angeles in order to feel more embraced as independent filmmakers.  While there, they found a thriving artistic community, eager to create art in all its forms, but especially film.</div>
<div>

<p>Julie wrote <i>33</i> while living in Portland, with the beautiful city as its backdrop (she currently resides in California).  So it was only fitting to return to the place which gave her so much inspiration, and hire local talent to serve on the crew and hold a casting call specific to Portland actors.  The result was a group of exceptionally wonderful individuals (<i><b>including actors: Kelsey Tucker, Kellie Holway, Jeffrey Arrington, and Dana Shea Miller</b></i>) who came together on a wholly collaborative and fun set.<br/></p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Need...</h3> <p>We were very lucky to have such a talented cast and crew, who generously donated their time, expertise, and equipment to the film, as well as local business, Zach's Shack, and Portland area residents who allowed us to freely film in their locations.  Any costs associated with our two-day film shoot (i.e., travel, food, etc.) were out-of-(small)pocket.</p>
<p>Now we've reached the post-production part of the process where editing, sound mixing and design, as well as ADR studio rentals come into play.  Furthermore, in order to get our film into as many festivals as we can, to reach a wide audience, promote our film, and independent filmmakers/filmmaking as a whole, we need additional funding for submission, promotional, and publicity purposes.  Estimated costs are around $3,500 (though we'd happily accept funding beyond that!).</p>
<p>Of course, in return for your gracious contributions, there are incentives--from social media shout-outs and on-screen credits, to free admission to a festival screening and a meet and greet with the film's Writer and Executive Producer!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The importance of getting this film finished and seen by audiences goes beyond showcasing our cast and dedicated crew's love of creativity and storytelling.  This story will hopefully serve to resonate with women who go against the grain no matter what anyone else's idea of what their life should look like is, who gather strength from the difficult life decisions they may face--whether related to their careers, relationships (familial or romantic), or personal journeys--and what it means to be a strong female despite obstacles, and to do what's right for each of us, even if the journey is a long, challenging, and lonely one.  </p>
<p>This story, written by Julie Kristine Sullivan (who also serves as Executive Producer and Lead Actress) is but a 12-minute glimpse into one woman's struggle in life, one with which audiences can hopefully sympathize, or empathize, and perhaps gain courage to go their own way.</p>

<p>Though we aren't asking for much, we know money can be tight (boy, do we know!).  Indie film needs as much support and word-of-mouth publicity as possible since us indie filmmakers are often up against studio films with much larger budgets that can employ TEAMS of marketing people and PR legends who will make it difficult for the public to go anywhere or watch anything without seeing some sort of promotion of their blockbuster.  We don't have an endless budget, BUT you can be our publicity team!</p>

so much for visiting us and reading about our film. <i>Amazing Space</i>
is, quite simply, an hour-long audio/visual meditation on space that will both
entertain and mystically guide you through a visually mind-blowing
tour of the cosmos. The footage and
cosmic images along with the stirringly beautiful music composed and performed by
Kristin Hoffmann, will take you on a spiritual journey from Earth to the depths
of the Universe and back. It is intended
not for educational purposes, but for the viewer to become immersed in the
music and to enjoy and reflect upon the immense awesomeness of space.</span><br/></p>
<p>For
many thousands of years, humankind had little else to do in the darkness of
evening but to lie back and watch the only show in town; the night sky. The heavens were a source of mystery, wonderment, and entertainment for our
ancient ancestors. They still are today, but we are often too busy and too
wired into technology to contemplate the constellations. And even if we
wanted to, our excessive use of outdoor ambient lighting, unfortunately, obscures
our vision of the night sky. <i>Amazing Space</i> puts us back in touch with the cosmos and reminds us to occasionally look up to take in its beauty and to
appreciate how mysterious and miraculous it all is.</p>
<p>The
ethereal music and spectacular images in our film will lead you away from the
stressful minutia of the daily grind and allow your mind to pause and
contemplate the enormity of the universe and how we are immersed in this great
fabric of humanity and space. Your
support will help us complete the project and bring it to market. We look
forward to sharing this cosmic road trip that we have enjoyed so much creating.</p>

<p><i>Amazing Space</i> is all about the music. It’s the music that
grips your mind’s attention and carries you on waves throughout the
cosmos. Kristin Hoffmann composed the soundtrack to be a sonic rise
through the chakra energy centers of the body/soul…a resonant ascent through
inner space mirroring the visual ascent through outer space. In the first
track, the whole journey begins with a guttural, earthy, root chakra, ancestral
call of didgeridoo and bullroarer, immediately demanding your full attention with
a vibe that penetrates into your spiritual core. In the following pieces,
you peacefully travel deeper into space carried along by the hypnotic sounds of
piano, strings, wind instruments, sarrod, cello, and voices. The music is
captivating and transformational…the perfect vehicle to immediately immerse
yourself in wonder and to quiet the fast-paced wandering of the day-to-day
mind. The film was beautifully edited by Elan Alexenberg to transition
and flow perfectly with the sonic landscape, creating a seamless synchrony of
sound and space.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1250250/files/20150226003823-WhyMeditation.jpg?1424939903"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>There is overwhelming evidence of the profoundly
beneficial effects that mediation has on our mental, physical, and spiritual health
in our daily lives. Study after study
clearly demonstrates the positive results when practiced daily in one form or
another. People think of good health in
terms of a nutritious diet and regular exercise, but in reality, stress and
mental distractions are also the root causes of many sicknesses, physical
injuries, professional mistakes, accidents, etc. The need for mental and spiritual reprieve is
especially true today as we are more “wired” than ever resulting in very little
mental “downtime.” Unwinding the mind
takes discipline and extra effort, but meditation is available to anyone who is
willing to give it a try. The flexible
design of <i>Amazing Space</i> means that it can be viewed in its entirety or in
segments so you can tune in to your favorite musical portion or randomly watch
a few minutes simply to become focused, to relax
your body and elevate your spirit; in other words, put your life back into
balance. The positive effects of
meditation can be felt almost instantaneously and it only takes a few minutes
throughout the day as needed. Tune in
to any portion of the <i>Amazing Space</i> movie and set your thoughts free to ponder the
riddles of the universe, and you will experience the tremendous benefits of
simply calming the mind. </p><p><br/></p><div>

</div><p><b>The Story so Far……</b></p>
<p>HCR Films Ltd. is an independent film production company based in Bradford. In 2013 we launched our short film Gatecrasher which became an international success. With your help we now hope to shoot the full feature length version of the film this year in Bradford.</p>
<p>Gatecrasher is a drama, written by a young Yorkshire writer Adam Hughes, a winner of last years Kenneth Brannagh New Writers Awards. It is a film about obsession, ambition, sexuality and about how far you are prepared to go to attain your dreams. Set in the world of Theatre, TV and Film, it tells the story of young up and coming actor Mark Jenkins, played by the immensely talented Ryan Prescott (Emmerdale, Casualty, Holby City, Marshlands and Vampire Academy etc.) and his growing obsession with the hugely successful author and playwright James Francis, played by Frank Ryan (Vacation Hunter, Clean Slate, Hobgoblyn, Heartbeat etc.).</p>
<p>The Short film can be viewed on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf0yE51i5uo"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf0yE51i5uo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a></p>

<p>The short received excellent reviews from film critics in London, New York, Los Angeles and Toronto. It was screened around the World from Kiev to Rio de Janeiro, was nominated Best International Short at the Puerto Rico International Film Festival and won the Jury Award at the Frech Frivoles Festival in Berlin. The films reputation was further enhanced when Digital FilmMaker magazine published a full colour 6 page article on the making of the short last year.</p>

<p>Following it's festival run Gatecrasher was posted on YouTube and to date it has attained over a quarter of a million views, amazing for a British short film. We recently heard it is now very popular in China where they have added sub-titles and are even selling posters. In China it accumulated over 360,000 views. All of which augers well for the feature version.</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We had virtually no budget when it came to making the short, but what we lacked in hard cash we made up for in talent, sheer passion and a never say die attitude. That said a feature film, is about as different to a short, as a Mini is to a Ferrari and the difference in the costs involved in production are equally as great. In order to help raise the funds required to shoot the film to the standard required so it can compete with the best, we are launching this crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo and are urging Companies and Individuals  to support this endeavour.</span><br/></p>

HCR Films Ltd. is an independent film production company based in Bradford. In 2013 we launched our short film Gatecrasher which became an international success. With your help we now hope to shoot the full feature length version of the film this year in Bradford.
Gatecrasher is a drama, written by a young Yorkshire writer Adam Hughes, a winner of last years Kenneth Brannagh New Writers Awards. It is a film about obsession, ambition, sexuality and about how far you are prepared to go to attain your dreams. Set in the world of Theatre, TV and Film, it tells the story of young up and coming actor Mark Jenkins, played by the immensely talented Ryan Prescott (Emmerdale, Casualty, Holby City, Marshlands and Vampire Academy etc.) and his growing obsession with the hugely successful author and playwright James Francis, played by Frank Ryan (Vacation Hunter, Clean Slate, Hobgoblyn, Heartbeat etc.).
The Short film can be viewed on here
“One of the best indie films I have seen. 
Slick and polished, you have put together something 
that is awesome to watch, a real treat” 
Indyred Toronto

The short received excellent reviews from film critics in London, New York, Los Angeles and Toronto. It was screened around the World from Kiev to Rio de Janeiro, was nominated Best International Short at the Puerto Rico International Film Festival and won the Jury Award at the Frech Frivoles Festival in Berlin. The films reputation was further enhanced when Digital FilmMaker magazine published a full colour 6 page article on the making of the short last year.
“The films production quality is definitely a notch above what one usually finds”
The Independent Critic

Following it's festival run Gatecrasher was posted on YouTube and to date it has attained over a quarter of a million views, amazing for a British short film. We recently heard it is now very popular in China where they have added sub-titles and are even selling posters. In China it accumulated over 360,000 views. All of which augers well for the feature version.
“£60 film makes waves around the world”
Telegraph & Argus

We had virtually no budget when it came to making the short, but what we lacked in hard cash we made up for in talent, sheer passion and a never say die attitude. That said a feature film, is about as different to a short, as a Mini is to a Ferrari and the difference in the costs involved in production are equally as great. In order to help raise the funds required to shoot the film to the standard required so it can compete with the best, we are launching this crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo and are urging Companies and Individuals  to support this endeavour.

</p><p>SEDUCTIVE AFFAIR<br/><br/>""Seductive
 Affair"" is a story about a Latin-American husband and wife, Amber and 
Jose Picena.  Amber Picena  endured a lot of heart-aches and lonely 
nights being married to Jose Picena; a United States Marine. Amber spent
  many years glued to the television in turmoil, cringing in fear 
whenever reports came in of American troops being killed;  praying 
whole-heartily that it wasn't her husband. Every night, she sat on the 
sofa motionless praying for new dreams and a new life. Once Jose Picena 
return home from Afghanistan both his and Amber's worlds will shatter. 
while Jose Picena struggled with life away from war, Amber began to lose
 patience with her husbands' lack of affection towards her. One day in a
 state of rage, Amber got up from her sofa and demanded a divorce. Jose 
Picena who's been raised Catholic becomes conflicted with the idea of 
divorce and tries to attempt to get Amber to change her mind. Dealing 
with her own afflictions,  Amber turns down the road of deceit and sends
 Jose on a roller-coaster of events.</p><p>I am really passionate about this story for
many reasons. I wrote this story with a simple idea of wanting to direct a
project that had a strong message, but one that I could be able to relate.<span>  I wanted to tell a story that contains
authenticity, revolve around human relationship, and contain dramatic
situations. I am extremely passionate on how humans interact with one another,
especially with the opposite sex. As I wrote, the story <i>Seductive Affair</i> came to life. This is a story that is about
divorce and how it conflicts with Catholic beliefs. I included a military
aspect to the character since a vast majority of my family is in the military.
The story started to take on a lot of my own personal experience without me realizing
it. I come from a divorce family. I wanted to show that divorce usually sends
both individuals into negative areas and the lack of communication is what's
lost as the marriage start to fall apart. </span>
</p><p>This story is important for its unique way
of touching on the topic of divorce and showing how the breakdown of
communication can drive a wife to do extreme things (luring her husband into an
affair to get a divorce). On the other hand, her husband is face with a
dilemma that turns him against his Catholic beliefs. This story carries a
powerful message about divorce and the key component that either person
(husband or wife) can make or break a marriage. I am the voice of many children
who seen the destructive nature of divorce. I hope that I magnified the
breakdown of communication or inability to compromise that leads to two people

 Affair"" is a story about a Latin-American husband and wife, Amber and 
Jose Picena.  Amber Picena  endured a lot of heart-aches and lonely 
nights being married to Jose Picena; a United States Marine. Amber spent
  many years glued to the television in turmoil, cringing in fear 
whenever reports came in of American troops being killed;  praying 
whole-heartily that it wasn't her husband. Every night, she sat on the 
sofa motionless praying for new dreams and a new life. Once Jose Picena 
return home from Afghanistan both his and Amber's worlds will shatter. 
while Jose Picena struggled with life away from war, Amber began to lose
 patience with her husbands' lack of affection towards her. One day in a
 state of rage, Amber got up from her sofa and demanded a divorce. Jose 
Picena who's been raised Catholic becomes conflicted with the idea of 
divorce and tries to attempt to get Amber to change her mind. Dealing 
with her own afflictions,  Amber turns down the road of deceit and sends
 Jose on a roller-coaster of events.I am really passionate about this story for
many reasons. I wrote this story with a simple idea of wanting to direct a
project that had a strong message, but one that I could be able to relate.  I wanted to tell a story that contains
authenticity, revolve around human relationship, and contain dramatic
situations. I am extremely passionate on how humans interact with one another,
especially with the opposite sex. As I wrote, the story Seductive Affair came to life. This is a story that is about
divorce and how it conflicts with Catholic beliefs. I included a military
aspect to the character since a vast majority of my family is in the military.
The story started to take on a lot of my own personal experience without me realizing
it. I come from a divorce family. I wanted to show that divorce usually sends
both individuals into negative areas and the lack of communication is what's
lost as the marriage start to fall apart. 
This story is important for its unique way
of touching on the topic of divorce and showing how the breakdown of
communication can drive a wife to do extreme things (luring her husband into an
affair to get a divorce). On the other hand, her husband is face with a
dilemma that turns him against his Catholic beliefs. This story carries a
powerful message about divorce and the key component that either person
(husband or wife) can make or break a marriage. I am the voice of many children
who seen the destructive nature of divorce. I hope that I magnified the
breakdown of communication or inability to compromise that leads to two people
going from best friends to complete stranger who cannot tolerate each other.

</div></div>","The cartoon deepens the knowledge, understanding and responsible attitude towards animals. In a non-preachy, friendly manner, it educates about various areas in our society where animals are used. It teaches respect for the life and wellbeing of all animals, the environment and promotes understanding of the interdependence between animals and humans.





To prevent the ill-treatment of animals amongst adolescents and improve the welfare of animals, through:



Formation of such fundamental qualities
as responsibility, compassion and kindness in youngsters.


Helping children become educated and
active members of society who can make informed decisions and think about their
consequences.


Promotion of moral and ethical values.


Raising awareness of the links between
human consumption of animal-derived products and animal suffering.






Every year in Russia millions of
homeless dogs and cats suffer and die. Cases of animal cruelty by children have
reached horrendous proportions. One of the main causes of irresponsible pet
ownership and violence towards animals is the absence of systemic approach to
teaching children the principles of humanism and personal responsibility.

Big Hearts Foundation believe that
Russia's future depends on the younger generation, so today, we are working on
tomorrow's success! This is why we have started the creation of the cartoon
series under the title of ‘Big Hearts’.
We believe, cartoons can be one of the
most effective ways of teaching    children. In addition, these cartoons can play
a supporting role in the upbringing of the child, which is important in
countries with low standards of living.
Not only does this unique project touch
upon issues that children in Russian-speaking countries encounter every day –
stray cats and dogs, but also includes a follow-up series which gently
approaches such issues as farm animal treatment and the use of animals for fur.
The goal is to teach children about the link between our daily actions and the
use of animals.














The creation of the Big Hearts series is
an expensive and complex process. The first episode, which highlights the issue
of the trade in exotic animals and real fur production, took 6 months to
produce. However, we have already created the characters and draft scenarios
for the remaining 9 episodes, therefore it will be much quicker and cheaper to
shoot the remaining episodes. And once 5-10 episodes have been produced, the
cartoon is guaranteed to be shown on at least 3 national TV channels, and
several online streaming channels.
The series is created under the
supervision of a qualified child psychologist, Veronika Savina, so no shocking
or inappropriate material for children appears in it.

                                                                                             










Big Hearts Foundation has already paid
GBP 30,000 for production of one episode and creation of the scenarios for the
remaining nine episodes. Each remaining episode will cost GBP30, 000 (this is the fee for the studio who creates them), totalling
a whopping GBP 270,000!To kick-start this project we are asking for your help
to initially raise GBP 120,000, which will be enough to create four more
episodes and enable us to broadcast them nationwide. When some of them are on air, we are confident to be able to get funding for the rest. Our charity will cover the Indiegogo fee, so every penny donated will go to the cause. If everyone makes a small
contribution, together we could build a foundation for the brighter future of
our children and animals! 










You will be helping to create the basis for a completely different outlook and attitude towards animals in the Russian-speaking society! It could lead to decreased animal abandonment and abuse, and fewer people purchasing fur! It could create a new generation which takes responsibility for animal welfare in their country, and creates functioning laws and mechanisms to benefit the animals and people!
P.S. In case we don't manage to raise the full amount, we will keep trying to fundraising the balance for this project  elsewhere . If that fails too all of the money will be used for humane education lessons in schools across Russia and other former Soviet countries.














Big Hearts Foundation is an
international charity, the purpose of which is ensuring adaptation and
application of Western practices for the protection and welfare of animals in
the territory of Russia and former Soviet countries.
The team consists mainly of volunteers,
as all donations received are spent on the NGO’s projects, including
legislative and educational programs as well as programs aimed at protecting
the rights of animals in general.
We are fighting for the day that animal
welfare is endorsed by effective legislation and has been understood and
accepted by everyone in the region.

<br/><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Interview with Scott Wilson <br/>
</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">(Taken 1 week before launch)<br/>
</h3>
<p><b>WG: </b>Okay, we're here today with Scott Wilson and we're talking about an exciting motorcycle trip to Sri Lanka this April and May. Scott, give us a rundown if you will please.<br/></p>
<p><b>SW: </b>Sure Bill, and yes, my name is Scott Wilson, I'm a filmmaker and writer. Now if you want more detailed information about me, you can check out my website below, but right now I'd rather focus on 'Tea on Two Wheels: This is Sri Lanka<i>.</i>
</p>
<p><b>WG:</b> Okay then, Tea on Two Wheels.<br/></p>
<p><b>SW:</b> Yes Bill, that's the working title of a documentary and book I'll be bringing out this summer. As we all know the world's becoming a well worn place, but believe it or not there still remain a few destinations that give pause for thought. You know, destinations that have been on the backburner for years, destinations that have just recently 'opened up.' Sri Lanka is such a place. I mean it's not unheard of, but many stayed away because of the civil war there. They were fighting right up til 2009, imagine that, a 26 year civil war that only ended 6 years ago! But the doors are open again and Sri Lanka's a fascinating place, bit of a time capsule if you will, it has beautiful beaches, stunning temples, fascinating architecture and quite the selection of wildlife...and let's not forget the food! The documentary will envelop the whole country and use tea as a backdrop.</p>
<p><b>WG: </b>Tea?</p>
<p><b>SW:</b> Yes, tea. Tea is huge in Sri Lanka. I mean they're the fourth largest producer in the world and one of the largest employers on the island and as it's harvested in the lowlands, the midlands and even in the higher elevations it'll provide a certain continuity to the documentary.<br/></p>
<p><b>WG:</b> Tea on Two Wheels...it has a certain ring about it, I'll give you that, but I don't drink tea so why would I care about it?</p>
<p><b>SW:</b> Well the documentary isn't 'just' tea Bill, but it is so prevalent in Sri Lankan culture and throughout the island that it makes a great through-line to tell my story. By tracking tea on motorcycle we'll track history and geography as well. Plus there will be time spent on non tea related shooting as we travel from region to region.<br/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Give and Get - Get and Give!</h3>
<p align=""left"" style=""""><b>WG:</b> So what's in it for us Scott? Why would I want to give you money, and if I did, not saying I'm going to, but if I did, where would it go?</p>
<p align=""left""><b>SW:</b> You're a very blunt man Bill.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>WG: </b>Just saying....there are a lot of good ideas out there.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>SW:</b> You're right, there are. So where will the money go? Well, for a start I need to get there so there will be an airfare to Sri Lanka, and once I arrive there will be some additional travel costs. There are accommodation costs to factor in as well. I'm hoping that I can stay at three separate tea estates but there's no guarantee of that. That's still in the workings. All the shooting gear is already taken care of but I will need some voice-over gear when I return. The recent shoot in Bolivia highlighted that little issue. I will be editing the documentary myself and depending what I bring back music may or may not have to be locked down. In a sense the amount I am seeking seems like a lot, but when you factor in a 1 hour documentary and a travel book on top of that, I don't think it is, especially in this industry. </p>
<p align=""left""><b>WG:</b> And perks?<br/></p>
<p align=""left""><b>SW:</b> Oh yes. 'There will be swag!' The end product of this campaign will be the documentary and book, so they will be up first as perks. I believe more every day in the digital medium and as a result the film and book will be initially offered in digital format. I know this isn't to everyone's taste, but when you stand hard copy costs next to digital ones in reference to the money being spent here, digital is the only way to go. For me the important thing is to finish and share the product with as many people as possible. Digital also allows a lower price point to attract sales further down the road, and to be honest I believe it's a nicer product. No you can't put it on a shelf but the picture quality will be on a par with film, and in the case of the book the images will be better then anything print can offer. There will also be copies of the book on Bolivia I'm finishing off as we speak<b>. </b></p>

<p align=""left""><b>WG:</b> Very nice. Okay Scott, what happens if you don't hit the mark. Let's say you're a thousand short. You going to call it off?<br/></p>
<p align=""left""><b>SW:</b> Well, if my dollar goal isn't met the trip will proceed as planned, there will be some obvious cuts, either in purchases or trip length, but I'm still going. Tea, Temples &amp; Tigers will be filmed and there will be a book. Now, if the goal is exceeded, wouldn't that be nice, all excess monies will go towards production equipment for 'The Shunting Yard' and towards the next doc (possibly Madagascar or Colombia).</p>
<p align=""left""><b>WG:</b> The Shunting Yard?</p>
<p align=""left""><b>SW:</b> Yes, but I'll get into that below Bill.</p>

</div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact - Today and Tomorrow<br/>
</h3> <p><b>WG:</b> Okay, so what's the ultimate goal here Scott?</p>
<p><b>SW:</b> Good question Bill, because it's so much more than just a book and a documentary. I used to be in the military and learned from experience that sometimes the most effective solutions come from a smaller footprint. As we all know film has never been a cheap medium, but thanks to digital development the costs have dropped dramatically. I mean the basic cost of putting an image on the screen is a fraction of what it used to be. I'm talking just about the image here, the rest remains the same. We still need a location, lights, props, actors, narrators, special effects and on and on and on. But if we look at the total breakdown of costs, and we were to separate the actual act of filming from the rest of the parts it has the potential to be a very cheap medium. That's where I'm focusing my attention.</p>
<p><b>WG:</b> Okay, tell me more.<br/></p>
<p><b>SW:</b> Look at the footage below. It was taken from a recent 6 week trip to Bolivia with a good friend, <i><a href=""http://www.paintingjourneys.com/HOME.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dominik Modlinski</a></i>. He's a landscape artist and I went with him to film him in the field. Now I directed, filmed, narrated and edited the film myself, and we had a crew of two, Dominik and myself. It's just a short clip, but you can see when you have a micro-crew you can access people and spaces that larger crews would find difficult.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F119214162&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F119214162&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F506388772_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>'The Shunting Yard' is going to be a place where my 'run and gun' docs come to life. 'Tea on Two Wheels' is going to be the blueprint for future docs. This trip will be used to not only create a product, but the DNA for a 'travel series' and a specific style of shooting for that series, and with your collaboration and whoever else might want to pitch in 'The Shunting Yard' has the potential to bring many interesting places and people to the medium, hence to you.</p>
<p><b>WG:</b> So you're looking at a production house?</p>
<p><b>SW:</b> Well, collaboration at any rate. I don't think you need a bricks and mortar production house any more...maybe a 'Production Site' would be more appropriate today. Many people look at Indiegogo as a means to raise money, which it is, that's why I'm here, but it also provides a platform for like minded people to connect, and potentially work together in the future. Collaboration can break down doors, we just need to know who's out there.</p>

</div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><b>WG: </b>And what do you see as your biggest challenge and risk?<b><br/>SW:</b> The challenge is money. It's always money. Behind just about every endeavour isn't a lack of passion or vision, it's usually a lack of funds. Money brings life to projects, simple as that. But with so many people out there pitching their ideas there's no doubt a 
weariness creeping in regarding 'yet another pitch.' It's hard to 
validate putting your money up to fund someone else's goal. But is it 
any different today than a 100 years a go when Hiram Bingham was funded 
to go after Machu Picchu. Absolutely not. Am I Bingham? No! I was born a 
century late and lack his background and knowledge, but I do believe in 
interesting stories and truths, just as he did. This is no different, it simply comes down to whether you believe in 
the person and their project or goal. This is just the beginning, there 
will be more to come and it would be great to start networking now and 
forging new alliances right here on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>As for the risks, I don't really see any to be honest. Personally I love the adventure and challenge and I'm confident of a great product and an expanding scope in the future.</p>

</div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways to Help</h3>
<b>WG: </b>And what about those who're hesitant financially but would like to perhaps give some moral support?<b><br/>SW: </b>The biggest thing here is getting the word out Bill. Telling people on Facebook and Twitter or even around the dinner table is invaluable. Word of mouth IS HUGE!!!

</div></div>","Interview with Scott Wilson 

(Taken 1 week before launch)

WG: Okay, we're here today with Scott Wilson and we're talking about an exciting motorcycle trip to Sri Lanka this April and May. Scott, give us a rundown if you will please.
SW: Sure Bill, and yes, my name is Scott Wilson, I'm a filmmaker and writer. Now if you want more detailed information about me, you can check out my website below, but right now I'd rather focus on 'Tea on Two Wheels: This is Sri Lanka.

WG: Okay then, Tea on Two Wheels.
SW: Yes Bill, that's the working title of a documentary and book I'll be bringing out this summer. As we all know the world's becoming a well worn place, but believe it or not there still remain a few destinations that give pause for thought. You know, destinations that have been on the backburner for years, destinations that have just recently 'opened up.' Sri Lanka is such a place. I mean it's not unheard of, but many stayed away because of the civil war there. They were fighting right up til 2009, imagine that, a 26 year civil war that only ended 6 years ago! But the doors are open again and Sri Lanka's a fascinating place, bit of a time capsule if you will, it has beautiful beaches, stunning temples, fascinating architecture and quite the selection of wildlife...and let's not forget the food! The documentary will envelop the whole country and use tea as a backdrop.
WG: Tea?
SW: Yes, tea. Tea is huge in Sri Lanka. I mean they're the fourth largest producer in the world and one of the largest employers on the island and as it's harvested in the lowlands, the midlands and even in the higher elevations it'll provide a certain continuity to the documentary.
WG: Tea on Two Wheels...it has a certain ring about it, I'll give you that, but I don't drink tea so why would I care about it?
SW: Well the documentary isn't 'just' tea Bill, but it is so prevalent in Sri Lankan culture and throughout the island that it makes a great through-line to tell my story. By tracking tea on motorcycle we'll track history and geography as well. Plus there will be time spent on non tea related shooting as we travel from region to region.
 


Give and Get - Get and Give!
WG: So what's in it for us Scott? Why would I want to give you money, and if I did, not saying I'm going to, but if I did, where would it go?
SW: You're a very blunt man Bill.
WG: Just saying....there are a lot of good ideas out there.
SW: You're right, there are. So where will the money go? Well, for a start I need to get there so there will be an airfare to Sri Lanka, and once I arrive there will be some additional travel costs. There are accommodation costs to factor in as well. I'm hoping that I can stay at three separate tea estates but there's no guarantee of that. That's still in the workings. All the shooting gear is already taken care of but I will need some voice-over gear when I return. The recent shoot in Bolivia highlighted that little issue. I will be editing the documentary myself and depending what I bring back music may or may not have to be locked down. In a sense the amount I am seeking seems like a lot, but when you factor in a 1 hour documentary and a travel book on top of that, I don't think it is, especially in this industry. 
WG: And perks?
SW: Oh yes. 'There will be swag!' The end product of this campaign will be the documentary and book, so they will be up first as perks. I believe more every day in the digital medium and as a result the film and book will be initially offered in digital format. I know this isn't to everyone's taste, but when you stand hard copy costs next to digital ones in reference to the money being spent here, digital is the only way to go. For me the important thing is to finish and share the product with as many people as possible. Digital also allows a lower price point to attract sales further down the road, and to be honest I believe it's a nicer product. No you can't put it on a shelf but the picture quality will be on a par with film, and in the case of the book the images will be better then anything print can offer. There will also be copies of the book on Bolivia I'm finishing off as we speak. 
Morning Drizzle, Dust for Lunch, Evo Morales: This is Bolivia



For those investing more there will be complimentary stays at:
 The Nomadic Bull Bed and Breakfast on Gabriola Island. 
Gabe has been my home for the last seven years and the house I built on the island has become the Nomadic Bull B&B. Just as the film and book hopefully will lure you to Sri Lanka, I hope the thought of a stay at the Nomadic Bull lures you to make a contribution towards this venture. Gabriola is a sweet place and the Nomadic Bull Bed and Breakfast is a nice slice of West Coast ambiance. 



WG: Very nice. Okay Scott, what happens if you don't hit the mark. Let's say you're a thousand short. You going to call it off?
SW: Well, if my dollar goal isn't met the trip will proceed as planned, there will be some obvious cuts, either in purchases or trip length, but I'm still going. Tea, Temples & Tigers will be filmed and there will be a book. Now, if the goal is exceeded, wouldn't that be nice, all excess monies will go towards production equipment for 'The Shunting Yard' and towards the next doc (possibly Madagascar or Colombia).
WG: The Shunting Yard?
SW: Yes, but I'll get into that below Bill.


  The Impact - Today and Tomorrow
 WG: Okay, so what's the ultimate goal here Scott?
SW: Good question Bill, because it's so much more than just a book and a documentary. I used to be in the military and learned from experience that sometimes the most effective solutions come from a smaller footprint. As we all know film has never been a cheap medium, but thanks to digital development the costs have dropped dramatically. I mean the basic cost of putting an image on the screen is a fraction of what it used to be. I'm talking just about the image here, the rest remains the same. We still need a location, lights, props, actors, narrators, special effects and on and on and on. But if we look at the total breakdown of costs, and we were to separate the actual act of filming from the rest of the parts it has the potential to be a very cheap medium. That's where I'm focusing my attention.
WG: Okay, tell me more.
SW: Look at the footage below. It was taken from a recent 6 week trip to Bolivia with a good friend, Dominik Modlinski. He's a landscape artist and I went with him to film him in the field. Now I directed, filmed, narrated and edited the film myself, and we had a crew of two, Dominik and myself. It's just a short clip, but you can see when you have a micro-crew you can access people and spaces that larger crews would find difficult.

'The Shunting Yard' is going to be a place where my 'run and gun' docs come to life. 'Tea on Two Wheels' is going to be the blueprint for future docs. This trip will be used to not only create a product, but the DNA for a 'travel series' and a specific style of shooting for that series, and with your collaboration and whoever else might want to pitch in 'The Shunting Yard' has the potential to bring many interesting places and people to the medium, hence to you.
WG: So you're looking at a production house?
SW: Well, collaboration at any rate. I don't think you need a bricks and mortar production house any more...maybe a 'Production Site' would be more appropriate today. Many people look at Indiegogo as a means to raise money, which it is, that's why I'm here, but it also provides a platform for like minded people to connect, and potentially work together in the future. Collaboration can break down doors, we just need to know who's out there.


  Risks & Challenges
WG: And what do you see as your biggest challenge and risk?SW: The challenge is money. It's always money. Behind just about every endeavour isn't a lack of passion or vision, it's usually a lack of funds. Money brings life to projects, simple as that. But with so many people out there pitching their ideas there's no doubt a 
weariness creeping in regarding 'yet another pitch.' It's hard to 
validate putting your money up to fund someone else's goal. But is it 
any different today than a 100 years a go when Hiram Bingham was funded 
to go after Machu Picchu. Absolutely not. Am I Bingham? No! I was born a 
century late and lack his background and knowledge, but I do believe in 
interesting stories and truths, just as he did. This is no different, it simply comes down to whether you believe in 
the person and their project or goal. This is just the beginning, there 
will be more to come and it would be great to start networking now and 
forging new alliances right here on Indiegogo.
As for the risks, I don't really see any to be honest. Personally I love the adventure and challenge and I'm confident of a great product and an expanding scope in the future.


  Other Ways to Help
WG: And what about those who're hesitant financially but would like to perhaps give some moral support?SW: The biggest thing here is getting the word out Bill. Telling people on Facebook and Twitter or even around the dinner table is invaluable. Word of mouth IS HUGE!!! Point folks in the right direction and let them decide....who knows, maybe they'll become involved in Tea on Two Wheels.WG: Okay, sounds like we have all we need for now Scott. I'd like to wish you all the best on this campaign and I look forward to seeing the doc and reading the book.SW: And I'd like to thank you for having me here today Bill, and I'd also like to thank all those that have taken time to peruse my campaign. Thank you.Now let's go to Sri Lanka and have a cuppa tea shall we?!

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>As a society, we take vastly more images than we ever have before. We shoot more video than we ever have before. We created a trillion new images in 2014 - more every minute than the entire 19th century. We use our cameras to document our lives, take notes, talk, share, expose, create, and spy. Major news events are driven increasingly by bystander captured media. </div><div><br/></div><div>Something big is happening across the globe, across industries, and across different elements of our lives. This project takes stock of how the recent developments of internet connected cameras, coupled with infinite storage and algorithmic power, have shaped our society and our identities over the last ten years.<p></p> </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3></h3>

<br/>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We're looking for $45,000 to fund equipment and travel expenses for two short and productive trips to help us finish the shooting phase of this project.  If we are able to reach our goal the first will be a trip to London, Dubai, Istanbul and Tanzania, the second will bring us to Seoul and Tokyo.</p>
<p>We've budgeted out two separate trips, the first to Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the second to Asia and India to pursue these stories as well as others that we are cultivating right now. We've budgeted that the first leg will cost roughly $24,000, inclusive of equipment, storage, travel and crew. The second we have budgeted out to approximately $21,000. <br/></p>
<p>What you'll get from this, is a deeper, more diverse, and more richly told story about how this phenomenon is playing out globally. A few specific stories we are hoping to explore:</p>
<p>-We have a group of noted thinkers at universities and private companies in nearly every one of these locations that we have direct connections to, we're hoping to interview all of them, as well as any other individuals we are able to connect with between now and the trip to help explore as many angles of this complex story as possible. </p>
<p>-We have a relationship with a film production company in Tanzania, where local residents were first able to access the internet recently through smartphones. We want to look at how this has influenced the way they use and interact with images and video. </p>
<p>-We have a direct connection to upper level management at mobile companies headquartered in South Korea and Japan, as well as some fascinating smaller stories like the possibility of tracking down the designer of the very first cell phone camera. </p>
<p>If you know of a global story you think that we should work into our trip and this story, please contact us and let us know. </p>
<p>If we are able to exceed our goal, we'll be able to begin hiring professionals to work the post production end of the project, editing, sound mixing, color correcting, licensing music and building the project from a huge hard drive of raw footage into a beautiful and exciting film for you all to enjoy. </p>

<br/>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The impact of this project we hope will be really significant. We are taking a birds eye view of this phenomenon, so the final result will be exciting, entertaining, educational and thought provoking. Along the way we hope we'll be able to tell some stories and share some of the incredible information and ideas that our interviewees and travels have allowed us to collect. This will give our viewers the opportunity to understand what an incredible and dramatic phenomenon this is on a visceral level that only a feature length film can provide. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary As a society, we take vastly more images than we ever have before. We shoot more video than we ever have before. We created a trillion new images in 2014 - more every minute than the entire 19th century. We use our cameras to document our lives, take notes, talk, share, expose, create, and spy. Major news events are driven increasingly by bystander captured media. Something big is happening across the globe, across industries, and across different elements of our lives. This project takes stock of how the recent developments of internet connected cameras, coupled with infinite storage and algorithmic power, have shaped our society and our identities over the last ten years.   


What We Need & What You Get We're looking for $45,000 to fund equipment and travel expenses for two short and productive trips to help us finish the shooting phase of this project.  If we are able to reach our goal the first will be a trip to London, Dubai, Istanbul and Tanzania, the second will bring us to Seoul and Tokyo.
We've budgeted out two separate trips, the first to Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the second to Asia and India to pursue these stories as well as others that we are cultivating right now. We've budgeted that the first leg will cost roughly $24,000, inclusive of equipment, storage, travel and crew. The second we have budgeted out to approximately $21,000. 
What you'll get from this, is a deeper, more diverse, and more richly told story about how this phenomenon is playing out globally. A few specific stories we are hoping to explore:
-We have a group of noted thinkers at universities and private companies in nearly every one of these locations that we have direct connections to, we're hoping to interview all of them, as well as any other individuals we are able to connect with between now and the trip to help explore as many angles of this complex story as possible. 
-We have a relationship with a film production company in Tanzania, where local residents were first able to access the internet recently through smartphones. We want to look at how this has influenced the way they use and interact with images and video. 
-We have a direct connection to upper level management at mobile companies headquartered in South Korea and Japan, as well as some fascinating smaller stories like the possibility of tracking down the designer of the very first cell phone camera. 
If you know of a global story you think that we should work into our trip and this story, please contact us and let us know. 
If we are able to exceed our goal, we'll be able to begin hiring professionals to work the post production end of the project, editing, sound mixing, color correcting, licensing music and building the project from a huge hard drive of raw footage into a beautiful and exciting film for you all to enjoy. 


    


The Impact The impact of this project we hope will be really significant. We are taking a birds eye view of this phenomenon, so the final result will be exciting, entertaining, educational and thought provoking. Along the way we hope we'll be able to tell some stories and share some of the incredible information and ideas that our interviewees and travels have allowed us to collect. This will give our viewers the opportunity to understand what an incredible and dramatic phenomenon this is on a visceral level that only a feature length film can provide.

<p>Based on the doctoral research of Shella R. Zelenz, this film will offer a glimpse into the impact that colonization has had on various cultures, but more specifically the epigenetic traumatic inheritance passed on generationally and how it is manifesting in students today. Within this film we will uncover a deeper understanding of core human values, in-depth explanation of the science of epigenetics, and pro-active educational solutions that respect the human dignity of every student in America. The purpose of this film isn’t to target any particular group, but to offer evidence from well-documented historical experience to demonstrate the impact that epigenetic traumatic inheritance plays in the way in which our society develops and how educational institutions are the ideal platform to change this passing on of trauma from one generation to the next. This will not only offer a more stable society, it will also offer solutions that address the poor educational outcomes for so many American students, the joblessness that has transpired from our lack of providing proper human development in the educational settings, and ways in which we, as a society, can bring change to our own communities through the use of mindful educational practices.</p>
<p>Film Synopsis:</p>
<p>The film, RootEd, will focus on education, tribal values, and epigenetics. We will focus on students from different cultures and economic backgrounds. We will illustrate how varied their educational experiences are, and how epigenetics has impacted their educational outcomes. Our information sources and interviews include university professors, epigenetic scientific researchers, educators, students, and families. We will also delve into the different educational concepts including mainstream public schools and private schools, democratic schools and the unschooling movement.</p>All donors will receive special mention in the credits.

<p></p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>On Sunday January 31, 2015 the civil movement “Centennial without
this Regime” had organized a motorcade to Artsakh with the purpose of informing
the citizens about their initiative which is to do away with the existing
criminal regime in Armenia headed by Serzh Sargsyan (for further information
about the movement please visit <a href=""http://www.preparliament.com/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.preparliament.com/en/</a>
or email <a href=""mailto:foundingparliament@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">foundingparliament@gmail.com</a>
with any questions or inquiries). The participants of the movement and their
families, including women and children, had set out to disperse literature,
DVDs and to speak to local citizens about their cause. They have been doing
this for months throughout regions in Armenia.</p>
<p>The subordinates of the regime in Stepanakert organized and
committed a large-scale terrorist act in Berdzor on the Syunik to Artsakh
highway.  The police, including Special Forces units armed with sniper
rifles and automatic weapons, blockaded the motorcade and then brutally
attacked the participants and their vehicles.  Despite the fact that the participants obeyed the demand of
the police that the motorcade should turn around, the police attacked them as
they were trying to turn around and leave. The participants of the motorcade
were completely peaceful before, during and after the attack. There was
ABSOLUTELY no provocation on the part of the participants, which leads one to
believe that this was a maliciously premeditated and mandated attack. Several
of the participants, among them Artsakh war heroes and an independent journalist,
were brutally beaten and required hospitalization.  Others, including
women and children, were assaulted; all the while the vehicles themselves were
being attacked and severely damaged.</p>
<p>As a result of this violent attack, organized by the regime, 20
vehicles were damaged, 3 professional cameras were seized from the journalists,
numerous smart phones, which were being used to record the mayhem, were
violently taken from the participants.  The total amount of the damages is
around $40,000.00.</p>
<p>Most of the individuals who have suffered monetary damages have
modest economic means, which makes it very difficult for them to replace or
repair their material losses.  We must help them compensate their damages.
 We must do it not just because they need and deserve it, but because
whatever our beliefs we must keep Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Movement
safe in Armenia.  The way to do that is to lend a helping hand to the
innocent people who suffered only because they exercised what should be their
right in their own country.</p>
<p>In whatever way you can, take this small but incredibly valuable
moment to help, and share this story with your friends and family!</p>

ПАРЛАМЕНТА
К финансовой поддержке пострадавших
от насильственных
действий 31-го января, 2015 года;
Дорогим соотечественникам, 
31-го января 2015 года ереванский режим, совместно со своим
степанакертским филиалом, используя силы полиции и сборища лиц в штатском, осуществили
масштабную акцию террора по отношению к участникам просветительского
автопробега Движения ""100-летие Геноцида без режима"".
На границе между Сюником и Арцахом полицейские запретили участникам
автопробега въезд в Арцах. Затем, несмотря на повиновение участников
автопробега данному запрету, полицейские и неустановленные лица в штатском
подвергли участников автопробега жестокому избиению дубинками и камнями, не
пощадив при этом ни женщин, ни детей. Автомобили были также безжалостно
разбиты.
В результате организованной режимом акции террора нанесен
материальный ущерб 20 автомобилям участников пробега, отобрано и уничтожено 3
видеокамер пресс-центра Движения. Общий ущерб достиг 40,000 долларов США. 
Большинство владельцев поврежденных автомобилей являются людьми
скромного достатка и не в состоянии своими силами восстановить испорченное
имущество. 
Кроме того, Движению крайне необходимо приобрести новые
видеокамеры. 
Дорогие соотечественники!
Учитывая вышеперечисленные обстоятельства, Секретариат Учредительного
Парламента призывает вас оказать финансовую поддержку участникам автопробега,
 пострадавшим в ходе насильственных действий 31-го января 2015 года. Все
собранные средства будут направлены на возмещение ущерба, нанесенного
автотранспорту и на приобретение новых видеокамер. Если у вас нет возможности сделать денежное пожертвование по системе Indiegogo с помощью Pay Pal или  кредитной карты, то вы можете передать денежную сумму Учредительному Парламенту другими путями, чьи координаты помечены на данной странице http://himnadir.am/donate
В приведенном ниже видео наглядно проиллюстрирован антиармянский и
бесчеловечный почерк режима. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbF33yx8jpo:",0.0,3,"1 Campaign

If I had to pick one thing I did right with Snip, it was trusting the most talented people I could find to make my story come alive.  Just like last year, I'm proud to say that the whole cast and crew lives in or is from Northwest Louisiana. It's wonderful to be able to prove that the Shreveport area has all the talent needed to make a great film.  I spent months getting a team together that can be described with one word: Epic.

<p>Let's admit it: everyone's made fun of emo kids before. You usually can't tell boys apart from girls, which can get awkward (only for you, though), they take themselves more seriously than they should and they are just generally considered as moping, unproductive members of society. They're gloomy, depressing, they feel too much, sometimes they scream or, god forbid, cry. Some do it for the clothes, some do it for the music, and some do it to belong. Sonny did it for a reason.</p>
<p>Haunted by the memory of his recently deceased younger brother Gavin (sorry Supernatural fans, it's JUST a memory), all the while trying to cope with his devastated mother and his absentee father (or, you know, his absence), Sonny is having a hard time staying cool. And who wouldn't?</p>
<p>That's why Sonny makes a room in his mind where he retreats to when he wants to find something he's lost... or someone. He's not crazy though, it's not that kind of a movie. Like Shutter Island, what the hell. We're not making Shutter Island.</p>

<h3>Where is your money going?<br/>
</h3> <p> </p>As any true artists knows, we're constantly selling our 
grandmothers for the next big project that's going to change everyone's 
lives. Alas, grandmothers come in limited supply and some are still able
 to complain, and movies don't come cheap, even the inexpensive ones.<br/><br/>Most people want to eat for some reason, so there's that; if we could only shoot in one room, we would, but the movie would probably be somewhat bland, ergo some of the dough needs to go for moving the cast, crew and equipment round town and then paying the owner of whatever place we end up in. We even have a couple of blokes who are calling themselves ""professionals"" and expect to be paid, but our main cast and crew are working pro bono (sounds much better than ""for free"") so that we can afford to expend our main budget on the equipment itself.<br/><br/>Therefore any kind strangers passing by on the 
currents of Internet are kindly invited to spare some spare change so we
 change and spare our spare grandmothers for a change. You can then surf
 on, knowing that you've made a lasting impact (even in this economy!) 
on some grateful young artisan, who will in turn envision a personalized
 thank you message in his head. “Whoa, thanks dude, you're awesome.”</div><div>

that will lend a voice to the often misrepresented subculture. Thus
Sonny warped into existence, continuing to grow until it became her
Final Thesis at the Film Studies course of Kingston University, as
well as her biggest undertaking so far.



Where is your money going?
  As any true artists knows, we're constantly selling our 
grandmothers for the next big project that's going to change everyone's 
lives. Alas, grandmothers come in limited supply and some are still able
 to complain, and movies don't come cheap, even the inexpensive ones.Most people want to eat for some reason, so there's that; if we could only shoot in one room, we would, but the movie would probably be somewhat bland, ergo some of the dough needs to go for moving the cast, crew and equipment round town and then paying the owner of whatever place we end up in. We even have a couple of blokes who are calling themselves ""professionals"" and expect to be paid, but our main cast and crew are working pro bono (sounds much better than ""for free"") so that we can afford to expend our main budget on the equipment itself.Therefore any kind strangers passing by on the 
currents of Internet are kindly invited to spare some spare change so we
 change and spare our spare grandmothers for a change. You can then surf
 on, knowing that you've made a lasting impact (even in this economy!) 
on some grateful young artisan, who will in turn envision a personalized
 thank you message in his head. “Whoa, thanks dude, you're awesome.”



Can I buy some shares?
 We'll give them to you for free! You can share as many times as you want, and are even encouraged to do so! Crazy! We are going bankrupt, giving shares away like that! What's happening!
It's all part of our clever financial plan which dictates that the more shares there are, the greater the return. Even the old proverb states: ""He who doth share, doth verily care! Indeed, nyes, quite."" You can look it up.
Every word of mouth, link, whisper and nudge you pass on will be greatly appreciated and will help us reach our goal faster, so that we can go do what we're good at; and it comes at no cost to you at all. Just, y'know, think about it.Follow us on Twitter and Istagram to get the latest updates @ayscollective

You can attract whatever it is you want into your life and it is alright not to have all the answers. You don't have to know the HOW, only that you WILL. My hope with this film is for people to push themselves... creatively, physically, and mentally. Go somewhere that you have been terrified to explore. You just might be surprised with what you gain from the experience. Every person involved with this has had many successes of their own for doing just that.

<li>Laralee has been writing, producing and directing theatre since 1985, including 10 years in Los Angeles.  She has directed and produced over 100 live productions.  Half of Twenty Two is her film debut, and is thrilled to bring this much needed film to life.  This film is currently being submitted to film festivals around the world, and was accepted to the very first festival to which it was submitted!  </li>
<li>Half of Twenty Two is dedicated to tween girls EVERYWHERE, because there is very little, if any, entertainment specifically for tween girls.  This is unusual, because it seems to be one of the most harrowing times in a girl's life.  Ask ANYONE, female or male, about their junior high years and they will shiver at the thought.  Half of Twenty Two's goal is to give a voice and role models to tween girls all over the world.   It is our pleasure to recognize this group of magical beings and create something specifically for them.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Part YOU Play!</h3><p>The film is complete.  We just need help with Marketing to secure distribution:</p><ul>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">OUR FILM IS ALREADY COMPLETE!  :D  So, there is no reason to meet pre-production, production, or post funding.  Our film has already begun it's journey out into the world through private screenings and submissions to film festivals and was ACCEPTED to the very first festival it was submitted to!  What we need now is funding to market and promote this film.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Your contributions, in any denomination, will fund our marketing campaign, cover licensing and legal paperwork fees, film festival entrance fees, DVD and Blu-ray replicating necessary for promotion and marketing, expenses in printing, travel expenses to festival destinations as we are accepted to film festivals around the world, and so many other costs associated with marketing,  and promoting a film.</span></li>
<li>If for any reason we do not reach our goal, every penny you have contributed will be utilized by priority, to make certain we complete our necessary expenditures.  We will continue to fund-raise in other locations as well, until we reach our final fundraising goals.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>YOU are Helping Us Give Positive Choices to Tween Girls! </h3><p>This film has an EXTREMELY POSITIVE and IMPORTANT MESSAGE for tween girls, as well as younger girls between the ages of 9 to 11 :</p><ul>
<li>Currently, we are not aware of more than a handful of Positive Image, Girl Power Films with Intelligent, Motivated Characters as role models for our young and tween girls. On the contrary, young girls today are subject to an incessant barrage of inappropriate role models, sporting completely nude or ""next to nothing"" as they bump and grind across their hot pink media screens.  This concerns us, because we all know the decisions we make between 6th and 8th grades, can lead us to who we will eventually be.  This precarious, junior school experimentation time, is where major trips and falls can, and often do occur. </li>
<li> We NEED young girls to know, it's PERFECTLY OKAY and PREFERABLE to keep their clothes on.  They should expect all people to respect them as PEOPLE not OBJECTS.  I truly wonder what those dedicated to women's suffrage  across the globe would have thought they were fighting for, if we could show them just 15 seconds of some of our most popular female music videos.  </li>

</ul><p></p><p><br/></p></div>","Half of Twenty Two SummaryHalf of Twenty Two ~ is a feature film dedicated to tween girls, and the daily trials they encounter. Miranda, an 11 year old lover of books, who yearns to someday be a famous author, begins her day in her usual way...shall we just say, she is not a morning person? Miranda attends 6th grade at St. Joan of Arc Catholic School.  On this day we become familiar with Miranda and 5 of her closest girl friends as they discuss what it's like to be an 11 year old girl in the 21st century. Having lunch in the park during a field trip, where they've gone to gather fossils, they hilariously reveal their preteen insecurities and complaints of having no control over, not only their lives, but the daily changes in their own bodies.We take a comical journey through Miranda's imaginary music video and possibly meet her true love.Everything is fun and gleeful...until Miranda's world is turned dramatically upside down and she is hurled sideways into reality.Writer, Producer, Director ~ Laralee List
Laralee has been writing, producing and directing theatre since 1985, including 10 years in Los Angeles.  She has directed and produced over 100 live productions.  Half of Twenty Two is her film debut, and is thrilled to bring this much needed film to life.  This film is currently being submitted to film festivals around the world, and was accepted to the very first festival to which it was submitted!  
Half of Twenty Two is dedicated to tween girls EVERYWHERE, because there is very little, if any, entertainment specifically for tween girls.  This is unusual, because it seems to be one of the most harrowing times in a girl's life.  Ask ANYONE, female or male, about their junior high years and they will shiver at the thought.  Half of Twenty Two's goal is to give a voice and role models to tween girls all over the world.   It is our pleasure to recognize this group of magical beings and create something specifically for them.
The Part YOU Play!The film is complete.  We just need help with Marketing to secure distribution:
OUR FILM IS ALREADY COMPLETE!  :D  So, there is no reason to meet pre-production, production, or post funding.  Our film has already begun it's journey out into the world through private screenings and submissions to film festivals and was ACCEPTED to the very first festival it was submitted to!  What we need now is funding to market and promote this film.
Your contributions, in any denomination, will fund our marketing campaign, cover licensing and legal paperwork fees, film festival entrance fees, DVD and Blu-ray replicating necessary for promotion and marketing, expenses in printing, travel expenses to festival destinations as we are accepted to film festivals around the world, and so many other costs associated with marketing,  and promoting a film.
If for any reason we do not reach our goal, every penny you have contributed will be utilized by priority, to make certain we complete our necessary expenditures.  We will continue to fund-raise in other locations as well, until we reach our final fundraising goals.
YOU are Helping Us Give Positive Choices to Tween Girls! This film has an EXTREMELY POSITIVE and IMPORTANT MESSAGE for tween girls, as well as younger girls between the ages of 9 to 11 :
Currently, we are not aware of more than a handful of Positive Image, Girl Power Films with Intelligent, Motivated Characters as role models for our young and tween girls. On the contrary, young girls today are subject to an incessant barrage of inappropriate role models, sporting completely nude or ""next to nothing"" as they bump and grind across their hot pink media screens.  This concerns us, because we all know the decisions we make between 6th and 8th grades, can lead us to who we will eventually be.  This precarious, junior school experimentation time, is where major trips and falls can, and often do occur. 
 We NEED young girls to know, it's PERFECTLY OKAY and PREFERABLE to keep their clothes on.  They should expect all people to respect them as PEOPLE not OBJECTS.  I truly wonder what those dedicated to women's suffrage  across the globe would have thought they were fighting for, if we could show them just 15 seconds of some of our most popular female music videos.  
The twerking model for mentorship is fine for some, but as an alternative, we might want to fund more opportunities to create positive, real-world role models, readily available to our girls, in our many forms of media.  Our planet is filled with awesome women doing so many more miracles every day than ever before.  With female executives in every field of employment, women have made huge strides in the world, but for the most part, let's be honest, our most popular entertainment options offer our girls not much more, than the hope they will look great in a bikini.  
All forms of art and entertainment should be funded, but maybe it's time to ADD to the mix a little MORE POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT FOR OUR DAUGHTERS, to help them make better choices for their future,

Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

<h3>Why do I think CRIME is the Answer?</h3>
by Creator Alex P. Michaels
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It may seem a little odd to say doing a crime show is my way of showing I love Cleveland, but it is. I see the potential in this place and I know with the right kind of story, we don't have to wait for Hollywood to come save us. We can save ourselves. We have a beautiful, diverse city. Like every place, it has problems, but we face them and we grow and become better. You can never count us out.  </p>
<p>My love of this city can be summed up in this quote.</p>
<p><i>""Some men see things as they are and say, why; I dream things that never were and say, why not.”</i><br/></p>
<p><b>""de la Oscuridad""</b> is a homage to Rod Serling who used 
""The Twilight Zone"" to address social issues through a good story.  My 
intention with <b>""de la Oscuridad""</b> is to tell a story that entertains, but 
also show what a difficult job the police have in protecting people and 
how some have lost touch with the very community they are seeking to 
protect. Some believe Protests will change things. Because I am an 
artist, I think ART will change things. </p>

We have brought back aboard our first sponsor Lucy's Sweet Surrender, a great Renowned local Hungarian bakery on Chagrin Blvd, which is right down the street from LaunchHouse, where Prelude2Cinema is housed. 
The Teaser below features Lucy's Sweet Surrender

Where does the Money Go?


This is our first SAG (Screen Actors Guild) production, so most of the funding will go for cast. We also have ROLES open for our Contributors. Yes, we want to Make you a ""Star.""


Story                        $ 6,000
Producers               $ 3,000
Director                   $ 3,500
Sound                       $ 3,000

Cast                         $46,000
Set Dressing            $ 2,000

Camera Labor         $ 2,500
Studio                        $ 1,200
Wardrobe Supplies $ 2,500

Props                          $ 2,300

Digital Storage          $   500

Total Production Budget $72,500After shooting, Prelude2Cinema will begin editing. We will absorb the cost of post-production (editing) and we are working on finding corporate sponsorship for other episodes in the first season (which is a planned six half hour episode arc).What if We Don't Reach Our Goal?
Being indie filmmakers, we have managed to make a little go a long way. Thanks to this experience, we will put every dollar to use and also lessen our fees and work to defer some fees if we do not meet our goal. We are seeking a New Media contract from the Screen Actor's Guild, which allows us to negotiate rates with actors. We will also seek funding off-line in the ""real world.""We believe this Budget is reachable and the story has gathered support and talent who are excited to bring it to life. 
""de la Oscuridad"" is the Reboot 
""This isn't our First Rodeo.""""de la Oscuridad"" is the Reboot (or Re-imaging) of a series we did titled ""Out of Darkness."" We think we were way ahead of the curve in creating a TV Series here in Cleveland. Although we had some great, great sponsors, there was not enough funds to support a long term series. A scene from the Original Series ""Out of Darkness"" Episode Three ""Hot for Teacher"" which has been veiwed over 94,000 times on our YouTube Channel

We Want You to Be Involved
We would love to connect with the Men and Women who put their lives on the Line to Protect Us. We also want ""de la Oscuridad"" to act as Bridge bringing the Police and the Community together.Getting to Know You

South-East Asia, Myanmar was an isolated place for half a century. Inaccessible
to foreigners before 2010, it can now be explored and brings joy to whoever is
in search for genuine, unchanged traditions. Its culture is even more beautiful
and valuable than the gems enriching its lands: capital cities of former
kingdoms have been preserved almost intact for thousands of years, a cultural
and religious beauty hard to find anywhere else. Yet, in spite of the troubles
in the last decades, this land’s treasure is the people themselves. More than a
hundred and thirty ethnic groups, with two hundred languages and dialects
currently spoken, form a tremendously picturesque mosaic. The royal majesty
each and every person radiates, their warm smiles, honesty, and generosity, as

<p></p>
<p>Completely isolated areas until a few years ago are now opening to travelers. That is why we focus on such remote places,
lacking in infrastructure, with disputable validity of special permits and overall
costs, but immensely attractive because of the culture and civilization that
have been preserved intact by various ethic groups living there: the golden stupas
of Yangon and its vast colonial heritage, Loikaw – the isolated capital of Kayah,
the Shwe Oo Min pagoda from the caves of Pindaya, the U-Bein wooden teak bridge of Amarapura,
the boat trip on Ayeyarwady from Mandalay to Bagan, the sunset at Shwesandaw –
one of the two thousand temples of Bagan, the rice fields and the
archeological sites of Mrauk-U – the old capital of Rakhine, the fishing
villages of the Bay of Bengal. </p>
<p>The waves of civilization are now storming the country. Apart
from improvements, they are also bringing about the dissolution of many
traditions and values that have been highly respected and preserved since
immemorial times. Women with tattooed faces living on the hills of Chin province are among the last generations preserving the tradition. The smoothness
and peacefulness of Inle Lake are only troubled now by the fishermen who acrobatically
row with their feet through floating vegetable gardens. Such traditions and many
more are likely to disappear or to be transformed. Given the circumstances,
writing about and taking pictures of little or great Burmese wonders will have a
documentary value in the not so distant future.</p>

<p>Photography is my only hobby, my only source of inspiration and
my only purpose in life. It may seem simple, ordinary, beautiful, even poetic.
Every day I find myself overwhelmed and born again by art. Art takes my worries
away, comforts my heart ache, teaches me the importance of every single moment.
Above all, there is this dream I used to have and I still cherish: to travel and
to take photos at the same time. You may find it hard to believe, but once I
return from a journey, I hardly remember any visual elements; all there is left
is nothing but feelings and photos. Nothing else. It may seem a little, but in
fact, there is a whole world around me, a vast space I deeply want to share
with everybody else. I would really love to make people happy, to encourage
them to discover places they have never consider visiting or they just cannot
reach. I am totally committed to both photos and journeys, especially when I
mix them. When I travel, I don't eat, I don't sleep, a<span>ll I do is taking pictures,
communicate, discover, try to make the most of every minute. I have but one
goal: to share what I saw with as many people as I can. I want them to smile,
to think about what they see in pictures, to breathe the same air and to hear
the same sounds. I believe a good photography can spread the flavor of a
whole life, captured in a single moment. </span></p>

<p>I have been seriously thinking for a while now that my traveling genes are dominant. They remained hidden for years, but genes cannot be fooled, nor can
they be influenced or prevented from blooming. The simple facts that I was born on the very
line of the Earth’s equator, in Gabon, on the west coast of Central Africa and that until I started school I had been walking o<span>n the footsteps of Indonesian ants, could not be without consequences. My following trips to Nepal, Tibet,
Iceland, Peru, Morocco and many other countries were nothing but natural
developments of the journey I started on the very day I was born. I decided to
write down my experiences as I really needed to better understand what I had
been through, to keep my senses and my mind in good shape. Thus, I was able to
reflect upon what I had seen and felt. The positive feedback I got strengthened
my confidence in me as a story writer and I went on with writing more stories which I truly hope they might be sources of inspiration for all the travelers I'll come across through my writing. </span></p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><b>The Tarot Series</b><br/><br/>The Tarot has always fascinated me. Some view the cards as a fortune telling device, fun playing cards, or some source of devious magic. None of those perceptions hold up entirely, but the Tarot is in essence an intuitive guide that opens doors to one's sub and unconsciousness.  <br/><br/>A little historical fact, our modern day playing cards come directly from the Tarot, minus 21 of the 22 major arcana cards (the Joker aka The Fool got to stay) invented in the late Middle Ages. Also, the printing of Tarot cards was a major source of work for woodblock printmakers until the late Renaissance in addition to works for the church.<br/><br/>So why the Tarot? I've gravitated toward the Carl Jung school of thought that the Tarot cards, in particular the 22 major arcana cards, represent archetypes that surface in our dreams and are part of the great collective unconscious. The cards laid out in order tell the story of self-actualization.

I've done the reading, so now it's my job to visualize.<br/><br/>Ideally, I want my Tarot series to stimulate people to see what archetypes they relate to, pay more attention to their dreams, and realize that the pictorial images in dreams are the same across all cultures.  Or maybe the viewer just wants to enjoy the photographs. Or not. That outcome is not mine to own! Much like a Tarot reading...<br/><br/>I am drawing inspiration from the Tarot de Marseilles, Jungian Tarot, the Motherpeace Tarot, The Rider-Waite deck, and a set based on Mythology. Basically you can find a Tarot deck based on anything you like: angels, zombies, vampires, saints…that part is just fun. My guides in my photographic journey are Carl Jung, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Joseph Campbell and the entire camp from the Surrealist art and literary movement as their fascination with dreams directly correlates to the basics of this series.<br/><br/>I am raising money for the Tarot series in order that I may procure 22 costumes for the 22 major arcana cards, the building of a few sets, source objects that contribute to the imagery and symbolism in the cards, get Epson Fine Art Fiber paper for the perks, hair and make-up as needed, location fees, and misc. camera accessories to complete the images. And like the magic, your contribution turns into a photo with a contribution of $35 or more. No need for a Tarot reading to predict that one.<br/><br/>I sincerely appreciate your belief in me if you decide to help fund my project. I want the Tarot series to be beautiful, timeless, ethereal, and make an artistic impact. Come along with me on this journey!</div>","The Tarot SeriesThe Tarot has always fascinated me. Some view the cards as a fortune telling device, fun playing cards, or some source of devious magic. None of those perceptions hold up entirely, but the Tarot is in essence an intuitive guide that opens doors to one's sub and unconsciousness.  A little historical fact, our modern day playing cards come directly from the Tarot, minus 21 of the 22 major arcana cards (the Joker aka The Fool got to stay) invented in the late Middle Ages. Also, the printing of Tarot cards was a major source of work for woodblock printmakers until the late Renaissance in addition to works for the church.So why the Tarot?

Our passion are stories that make our world a more beautiful place. Filmmaking is a way to express ourselves and to share with our community and the world fascinating people that have a story to tell. </p>
<p>We gained a lot of experience working on Televizija Student (<a href=""http://www.televizijastudent.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.televizijastudent.com</a>) a student television network that produces smart, informative, fun and compelling programme.</p>
<p>Through our work we encountered a lot of very interesting and inspirational people and naturally an idea started to develop amongst us.</p>
<p>''We should make a documentary film!''</p>
<p>So our journey began with our first film ''Petite Ballerine''. The story is about a young ballerina named Leda Šeparović whose talent and hard work are evidence that although achievement doesn't come overnight it does comes to those who deserve it.</p>
<p>We see a lot of ourselves in Leda and it was a very eye opening experience to meet somebody so young yet so determined and focused on the one thing she loves most - ballet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She has finished ballet school in Zagreb and now she is going to Stuttgart to study ballet at a prestige ballet dance academy.  </p>
<p>The film also features Leda's ballet professor and former croatian prima ballerina Mrs. Mihaela Devald and the famous ballet choreographer Mr. Milko Sparemblek who at one time was the director of New York Metropolitan ballet opera. They will tell their story about ballet, about their ballet path and what it takes to become a professional ballet dancer.</p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>Helping us</h3> <p>The film is almost completed. Our current status is that we have edited most of the final version but the film needs more work. We need work done in the department of sound mixing and color grading. Since our team is very small we require outside assistance on that.  Also, we need to cover festival fees (in some cases), digital cinema package copy costs, promotional costs, travel costs etc. Our entire work so far was completely self budgeted but our savings have run their course and we need just that extra push to cross the finish line. The film's story demands of us to provide the highest quality we can manage so post production is very important to us. </p>
<p>As the work on the film enters in the final stage before distribution we will focus our effort to have the farthest possible reach to our audience by applying it to festivals and screening it to dance/ballet schools. In addition to that plan we are even hoping to screen the film in smaller towns and theaters for children and adults alike to enjoy. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">For your help you will get cool perks :)</span></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Quality is something all filmmakers strive to.  For us it was no different when we set out to make this film but we knew from the very start that we have to work around the technical limitations we had. Instead of renting and buying expensive gear, lights etc. we focused our energy on storytelling.  That way instead of talking about fancy cameras and lenses (and believe me we love our toys :) ) we talked about the people whose story we wanted to tell and about the structure of the film. In a way our budget limitations gave us time and freedom to discuss other things that in the end made the film very personal. It's not just another project for us you see. Leda's story is also ours, it's really a story about every person that wanted to do something but had to overcome doubts, fears, hardships and even criticism from those closest to them. That's why we want to show this film to as many people as we possibly can.</p>
<p>Our first cut was much shorter, it was about 11 minutes long. The first time we watched it together on  a big TV no words were spoken. Eyes wide open and complete silence in the room made for a moment we will always fondly remember. The happiness of watching something for the first time that you directed and created is a indeed a special thing.</p>
<p>But then you watch it again and again...and some things start to bug you. You know you can do better but you just can't because of limited resources. And it really bothers you. So what do you do? </p>
<p>The team got together and decided to reach out to the community! We hope to reach the goal together with the wonderful people who decide to help the film to shine the way we all want.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Reaching the goal together!</h3> <p>Being aware of the obstacles was our way of life for the first couple of weeks. No camera, no lenses, no audio equipment and no money whatsoever. But still we managed. Savings accounts and selling our personal items gave as a chance to start making our ballet journey. Some of the more specialised equipment we were able to borrow and so one after the other, we were able to take our obstacles down. But now at the finish line we ran out of dancing moves :) So that is why we need some dancing partners. You!</p>

<p>Sara Armstrong is an internationally-acclaimed, interdisciplinary artist who practices in both fashion and industrial design. Sara creates ready to wear pieces for Men and Women, with an androgynous blur, at once loyal to the functionality of heritage craftsmanship and subversive in their welcoming of innovative details.</p>
<p>With a focus on architecturally inspired urban luxury, Sara’s formal training in sculpture is immediately apparent in pieces that balance complex geometries with pared-down simplicity. Lucid yet intuitive, Sara’s work is hinged upon a tactile, hand-worked approach to design and an uncompromising appreciation for authenticity and quality. Carefully curated, lovingly handcrafted here in Vancouver, BC, Canada.</p>

I make these things to be lived in, with a set of community-minded values that I can live <i>with</i>. To this end, your donation will help me buy locally-sourced fabrics, and allot the time and materials to realize the collection to our standards of hand craft.  </p>
<p>For Sara Armstrong, each new season is very cathartic.

Sara Armstrong is an internationally-acclaimed, interdisciplinary artist who practices in both fashion and industrial design. Sara creates ready to wear pieces for Men and Women, with an androgynous blur, at once loyal to the functionality of heritage craftsmanship and subversive in their welcoming of innovative details.
With a focus on architecturally inspired urban luxury, Sara’s formal training in sculpture is immediately apparent in pieces that balance complex geometries with pared-down simplicity. Lucid yet intuitive, Sara’s work is hinged upon a tactile, hand-worked approach to design and an uncompromising appreciation for authenticity and quality. Carefully curated, lovingly handcrafted here in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

   WHAT WE NEED 
Conceive, design and purchase with purpose, with quality, process, and people in mind. I make these things to be lived in, with a set of community-minded values that I can live with. To this end, your donation will help me buy locally-sourced fabrics, and allot the time and materials to realize the collection to our standards of hand craft.  
For Sara Armstrong, each new season is very cathartic. But it is not a process that I take on alone. From photographers, to videographers, to musicians and makeup artists, it's about creating a compelling experience through the collective creative energy of other local emerging talent. It’s the only way to really take your practice to the next level – you need next level people. Your investment will help me to bring video, sound, photography, graphics and artists – all of the elements that go into the production of a season – together into an impactful Vancouver Fashion Week runway show, as well as an ensuing trunk show pop up project at @thisopenspace, that will help propel my brand forwards for seasons to come.

<p><b>THE BACKSTORY</b></p>
<p>I fell in love with classic Hollywood 'mythology' when I was very young, and have always been a fan of noir. <a href=""http://creativedistrict.com/project/6267/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Newsraven</a> allows me to recreate that world and redress the gender status quo to my liking. The project's seeds were planted when I moved to Los Angeles and began working for the '<a href=""http://disney.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mouse</a>'. On weekends I visited iconic locations and during lunchtimes I trawled old book stores near the studio, listening to fascinating stories about vintage Hollywood crimes, and the gutsy, wise-cracking female crime reporters of the 1930s and 1940s who happily covered the tough turf, purportedly a 'man's world'. </p>
<p>So inspired, I devised <b>a memorable female character, of the era, for the screen - Audrey Corbeau, and flipped a few <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tropes</a></b> . This is about a <b>woman journalist with moxie, cracking tough crime cases, aided and abetted by her unique posse</b>. Audrey's network are the people <b>the white men of noir generally ignore or despise.</b> In Newsraven they are Audrey's strength and trusted sources. In Newsraven, <b>men become the 'homme fatale'</b>, and <b>Audrey's best weapon is her feminine instinct, symbolised by a raven</b>. When I created Audrey I held this quote in my mind , <b>'Why try to fit in, when you were born to stand out'?</b></p>

<p><b>THE MOXIE</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Behind the scenes we're stirring things up too, because quite frankly I'm sick of just complaining about <b>the dearth of women in front of and behind the cameras. </b></p>
<p>You know the shtick - per the DGA’s research, for the <b>2012-13 season, women directors accounted for just 14% of primetime episodic TV</b> across broadcast and cable outlets. In a study run by the <a href=""http://www.seejane.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media</a>, discovered that the <b>ratio of men to women on the screen was 5.4 to 1 on TV</b>, with the percentages of <b>speaking female characters: only 28.3 percent</b> in prime time. Don't even get me started on the crew role inequalities.</p>
<p>But enough whining and waiting around for when we're told we can play. It's time to <b>'be part of the change we want to see in the world'</b>. </p>
<p>And fellas - this is not about exclusion. I'm all about <b>creating a level playing field for women and men to work together with gender equality and diversity respected across the board. </b></p>
<p>So please join the community to help me bring Audrey to the screen, <b>be entertained while making change happen - after all it's tax deductible!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</b></p>
</div>
</div>
<div> <p> Without your support and generosity Newsraven as a fully fledged pilot won't happen. Instead I'll be making a proof of concept video and shlepping that around Hollywood, and we know how that goes…<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It's a fact of life that it's not easy to break into the system. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It's also a fact that it's even harder if you're a woman or from a minority. Despite drama experience, without prior TV involvement or a pilot under your belt if you fit in this classification by today's standard you have little to no chance, whether you're a writer, director, producer, actor, cinematographer, sound recordist, make-up artist, hair stylist, costume designer, production designer, art director, sound mixer, composer or any other crew/post production member of the team to </span>be employed<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>

</div></div>","What a world, what a time, what a dame...Welcome to the Newsraven community. THE LOWDOWNTV Series. Neo-Noir Pilot Episode Los Angeles, 1934. Inspired by creative, gutsy, female journalists of yesteryear such as Dorothy Dix, and Agness Underwood, 'Newsraven' introduces sultry, tenacious, intrepid, crime reporter Audrey Corbeau. Torn between career and family, in a time when her choice was considered outrageous, Audrey delves behind the glamorous facade of Hollywood's glitz, solving some of the city's goriest crimes with instinct and moxie. Determined, she unravels felonies by gut instinct with the support of her fabulous network of female informers and cross-cultural pals spread out across the hotbed of crime that was LA in the 1930s. Everyone's trying to hide something in this game, even our gal Audrey.THE FACTSThe script has been drafted, so the focus of this campaign is production of the TV pilot and bringing Audrey to the screen, with the ultimate aim of using the success of the pilot to secure a series deal about this fabulous, galvanizing, wise-cracking crime reporter. Please join the Newsraven community and be part of this exciting 21century production of a feisty dame driven neo-noir TV pilot. Belief in the project has secured a partnership with the dynamic non-profit organisation From The Heart, which guarantees that your donation is TAX DEDUCTIBLE. The opportunity to produce Newsraven has been developed through the David Lynch MA in Film. With that kind of backing, I'm out to catch a big fish as David Lynch would say, and bring this gutsy and highly entertaining dame, created and to be produced by women, to the screen for all to enjoy.  And we're proud to say that Newsraven passes the Bechdel, Maki Mori and the Russo tests. How could you not join in the fun?Shoot dates are between March 31 to April 17.THE PILOT PLOTThe storyline for the pilot episode, Newsraven -'White Devil' is a riveting noir ride into 1930s Los Angeles. I was given some fantastic help through the David Lynch MA in Film to develop it, and now the script is ready to shoot. It's a real 'whodunnit', and we have some talented actors ready to play and crew ready to shoot. All we need is your help to make it happen! On this steamy summer's day in 1934, Hollywood's darling, Thelma Todd is opening her Pacific Palisades Café. Meanwhile downtown a young girl, who was brutally attacked at Jerry's Joynt in Chinatown overnight, is admitted to hospital.Who's the perp'? Is it one of Chinatown's community whom they're protecting? Is it an unknown felon terrorising Chinatown, unhindered by the disinterested LA Cops? Or is it sleaze bag, exploitation flick Producer Anton Goldfinch, under the squeeze from the Hayes Office Production Code? Audrey's aided, and stymied in equal measure at every turn by the handsome, enigmatic Barry Fulton, press photographer for the competitor newspaper, and by Chinatown's heavy hitter, the debonaire and mysterious Peter Yue.She'll need to dig deep,and work fast, racing against time to solve the mystery and write up the story before the ill-will brewing erupts into a race riot.
How passionate am I about this project? I  bought this beautiful, 1926, No.5 Underwood  because my inspiration, Aggie Underwood had the exact same one!
SHOWRUNNERAs a filmmaker I forged my professional career in both Australia and the USA, and am now combining my myriad of experiences as producer, writer and director to be showrunner on this entertaining and enthralling TV pilot. CREW - Watch this list grow during the Indiegogo campaign!Karen Borger | Director, Writer, ShowrunnerVelinda Wardell | Director of PhotographyMelissa Chaconas | Camera AssistantChandler Baucom | Camera AssistantMary Veronica Sweeney | Scenic ArtLaura Bustillos Jaquez | Scenic ArtRudoflo Rincones |Scenic ArtMichelle Kelling |Make Up (Fairfield)Simone Cozens|Hair & Make Up (Los Angeles)Max Sharam |  Title Track, 'Coma'Skunk River Medicine Show |  Music TracksCAST - Exciting announcements coming soon after the script 'table read' being help in Los Angeles on Tuesday, February 17, 2015!                                            Aggie Underwood interviewing a victim, or is this gal really the perp' !MULLA - FOR WHAT?The David Lynch MA in Film program is supplying goods-in-kind support in the shape of RED camera gear and sound equipment, plus a studio to shoot in. The 1930s-looking town of Fairfield is being generous with locations. Many incredibly talented actors are keen to play roles, and eager crew ready to work on the project, but we need to cover shoot expenses, look after cast & crew, create viable 1930s sets and shoot a few days in LA for exteriors.Thus, your generous gift of a tax deductible donation will fund a myriad of production expenses for the shooting of the TV pilot: 

Travel, accommodation, fees for our actors and crew. 


Costumes, make-up & art department rentals and hires


On set catering and safety provisions


Additional camera, grip and electrical gear


Insurance, location and production expenses to ensure we run a safe and productive set.  

I can just make it work for $30,000 which will cover a frugal production budget. But if we garner a higher sum through your belief in the project and support for our agenda of fostering greater equality in the industry, additional donations will be put to great use, ensuring better fees for actors and crew. 
We'll be running a second campaign for post -production at a later stage.


                                     

REWARDS 
Donors will be the first to be able to download the pilot and watch it! Based on your level of contribution you'll be rewarded with other cool opportunities - such as being invited to 'set' if you live locally to meet the stars, and also chances to enjoy some first edition retro 'prop' perks or a signed script - available only through this Newsraven Indiegogo campaign. 
So please check out the perks! Decide which one is a good fit for your donation and join the Newsraven community via your tax deductible donation. You'll be warmly welcomed in the fold, and given first hand news as the project travels through pre-pro, the shoot, and post-production.
THE BACKSTORY
I fell in love with classic Hollywood 'mythology' when I was very young, and have always been a fan of noir. Newsraven allows me to recreate that world and redress the gender status quo to my liking. The project's seeds were planted when I moved to Los Angeles and began working for the 'Mouse'. On weekends I visited iconic locations and during lunchtimes I trawled old book stores near the studio, listening to fascinating stories about vintage Hollywood crimes, and the gutsy, wise-cracking female crime reporters of the 1930s and 1940s who happily covered the tough turf, purportedly a 'man's world'. 
So inspired, I devised a memorable female character, of the era, for the screen - Audrey Corbeau, and flipped a few tropes . This is about a woman journalist with moxie, cracking tough crime cases, aided and abetted by her unique posse. Audrey's network are the people the white men of noir generally ignore or despise. In Newsraven they are Audrey's strength and trusted sources. In Newsraven, men become the 'homme fatale', and Audrey's best weapon is her feminine instinct, symbolised by a raven. When I created Audrey I held this quote in my mind , 'Why try to fit in, when you were born to stand out'?





THE MOXIE

Behind the scenes we're stirring things up too, because quite frankly I'm sick of just complaining about the dearth of women in front of and behind the cameras. 
You know the shtick - per the DGA’s research, for the 2012-13 season, women directors accounted for just 14% of primetime episodic TV across broadcast and cable outlets. In a study run by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, discovered that the ratio of men to women on the screen was 5.4 to 1 on TV, with the percentages of speaking female characters: only 28.3 percent in prime time. Don't even get me started on the crew role inequalities.
But enough whining and waiting around for when we're told we can play. It's time to 'be part of the change we want to see in the world'. 
And fellas - this is not about exclusion. I'm all about creating a level playing field for women and men to work together with gender equality and diversity respected across the board. 
So please join the community to help me bring Audrey to the screen, be entertained while making change happen - after all it's tax deductible!

RISKS & CHALLENGES


  Without your support and generosity Newsraven as a fully fledged pilot won't happen. Instead I'll be making a proof of concept video and shlepping that around Hollywood, and we know how that goes…It's a fact of life that it's not easy to break into the system. 
It's also a fact that it's even harder if you're a woman or from a minority. Despite drama experience, without prior TV involvement or a pilot under your belt if you fit in this classification by today's standard you have little to no chance, whether you're a writer, director, producer, actor, cinematographer, sound recordist, make-up artist, hair stylist, costume designer, production designer, art director, sound mixer, composer or any other crew/post production member of the team to be employed. 

So I am personally trying to make a change to the status quo, and aim take a team of women with me by giving them a first chance at TV on this project too. 
You can join the community of active contributors to that will make this happen through your tax deductible donation. 

And on a personal note, after 2 years out of the industry due to a spinal injury and too much time sitting around in hospitals, I'm re-entering the game in a way that works with my limitations. I may not be able to sling a camera and tripod over my shoulder and climb a mountain any more, but I sure can showrun. There's absolutely nothing wrong with my smarts, my talent and my will power (just a sore back!). All I need is for you to take a chance, back Newsraven and I'll make it happen.

I have puppet makers working very hard to make this film happen, but they don't come free!  My goal is simply to make people smile, and to have fun while doing it. However, I can't do that if I can't pay for the props needed.   What We Need & What You Get Does that sound like a lot of money for a silly little puppet film? Well, here's exactly what I'm looking for & why:  I'm asking for $3000 (or more, if you love me) because the puppets themselves were $1000. On top of that there are location fees of $1200 that I'm facing, and of course, a hungry cast and crew to feed! We're going ALL over to shoot this -- you'll see puppets in places you'd never think of! (They might even get put in the slammer! *Hint Hint*) Even if the goal of $3000 isn't reached, your donations will go towards the purchases that have already been made for this film, and to feeding my amazing and always hungry crew of wonderful people. They really are great.    The Impact 
The goal is to HAVE FUN throughout the entire process! (And if the stress of money is taken away...whew, that would be a whole lot easier.)
 I've worked on many, many productions before, but I want to be able to take a crew through my own work from start to finish and show everyone a product I am proud of -- not something thrown together out of desperation. This is the last thing I'll be doing at Drexel. I want to walk out with a smile, knowing I did my best to create a piece with major production value, knowing I didn't skimp on anything I didn't have to, that I put everything I had into this. I know that will happen if we have the funds to make this world I've created on the page feel as real on the screen.



    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  We're already partly on our way through pre-production, but we're not there yet! We film March 6th through the 8th, and we need all the help we can get before then.
Tell your friends! Tell your Mom! Tell your old teachers! Tell your dog! Tell strangers in the supermarket (oh jeez, who says supermarket? I meant grocery store)! Tell everyone you know and everyone you meet to check us out and donate. If you can't donate at this time, or your friends can't, you guys should still share our page! Hey, it's got my doodly sticky notes on it, what more could you want?   Thanks for sticking with me through this!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h4>$10,000 - 3 Months Development</h4>
<p>Your money buys us time and focus. If we reach $10,000 then we will open source the code on 1st May 2015.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We already have a working demo and with a bit more time we will be able to release a fully functional beta version.</p>
<p><b>The beta will contain:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>An Open Source Browser Plugin -</b> follows the time spent on websites and tips automatically</p></li>
<li><p><b>Privacy by Default</b> - all data is stored locally in the browser, ProTip does not collect your data without your permission.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Easy To Use Interface -</b> with automatic tipping.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Subscription Feature -</b> allows users to set a weekly allowance and reward content creators automatically.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>$10,000 is only our first goal.  If you really want this software, we can do so much more...</p>
<h4>$25,000 - 6 Months Development</h4>
<p>With this kind of money we can really give ProTip the kind of care and attention that it needs. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Advanced Subscription Features</b> - we would like to explore business models for artists to further develop the app. We will listen to ideas from the people themselves and we can work together improving ways to help you get paid.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Community Outreach</b> - let's create a movement where people are rewarded for their work online.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Software Automated Testing Suite</b> - for developers and documentation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>$50,000+ - Full Time Jobs - Killer Features</h4>
<p>Now we're cooking with gas! This is our vision:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Firefox Extension</b> - we hear you! We are privacy conscious, open source advocates.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Secure Feedback System</b> - we want to help artists and audiences to communicate directly.  No  email addresses or social media sign-in needed. Goodbye spam and unwanted newsletters!</p></li>
<li><p><b>Content Pass</b> - this idea would allow content creators to charge more for special content. This would allow creators to charge more for their most loyal audience.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Subscriptions -</b> for media such as podcasts, live streaming and API based services.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Following our first beta in May if we raise our intended goal we pledge to spend another 6-9 months fixing bugs, developing new features, responding to user feedback and translating the user interface.</p>
<p><b>Our goal is to have the first release ready by December 2015.</b></p>
<h4>What If We Don’t Get the Funding?</h4>
<p>Our pledge is to be long term contributors and stewards of this project, after all it’s our baby and we will try to deliver as much as we can. But it will take more time if we have to get jobs to pay the bills and put food on the table.</p>
<p>We will be using an iterative, open development process which means you won't have to wait long to see results.</p>
<p>The project is also Open Source meaning the code will be freely available in case someone more capable comes along.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><b>Can I Pay In Bitcoin?</b></p>
<p>Anonymous donors can pledge to the following address: <b>1ProTip9x3uoqKDJeMQJdQUCQawDLauNiF</b></p>
<p>
<b>How does ProTip measure the time I spend on each page?</b>
</p>
<p>
  ProTip can recognise if the mouse is active and which tab you are currently
  focused on. Once a minute it re-calculates the elapsed time.
</p>
<p>
<b>How does ProTip find the bitcoin addresses on the page?</b>
</p>
<p>
  ProTip looks for bitcoin addresses in three places in order of priority:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>1. In the header of the HTML:</strong><br/>
    &lt;meta name=""microtip"" content=""13U4gmroMmFwxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"" data-currency='btc' data-recipient=""John Doe""&gt;
  </p>
<p>
<strong>2. In bitcoin payment hyperlinks:</strong><br/>

<p>
<b>Is my personal data safe?</b>
</p>
<p>
  The browsing history is cleared immediately after your weekly donation.
  Simply not retaining data is a good privacy measure, which we think
  deserves to be a default setting.
</p>
<p>
  You can clear the browsing history anytime. When you run your browser in privacy mode the app is de-activated.
</p>
<p>
<b>Are my Bitcoins securely stored?</b>
</p>
<p>
  At the default security level the private keys are stored on your own
  computer, in a datastore that only ProTip can access. We believe that
  this is a good compromise of security and usability, given the wallet
  is never intended to hold large sums of money.
</p>
<p>
  At the higher level of security, you can encrypt the private key with a
  password. This password is required for each transaction. Like any Bitcoin wallet if you forget this password, your bitcoins will be lost.
</p>
<p>
<b>Can I backup my Bitcoins?</b>
</p>
<p>
  Yes, ProTip can provide an exportable backup for your public and private keys.

Our mission

The Waterford Wolves have a dream, and it’s a big
one! Our mission is to provide, live athletic entertainment that features adrenaline
filled excitement; to promote the discipline and character of American Football
in Ireland and to improve the community in Waterford as a whole. American
football is currently one of the fastest growing sports in the Nation and The Waterford Wolves are at the forefront.

Waterford
Wolves is a 100% player-owned and operated, non-profit organisation. This means
all Waterford Wolves' equipment and events to-date, have been conceived, orchestrated, and run
exclusively by its members and volunteers.
Why we're doing this We're creating this fundraising goal as playing American Football safely can be expensive. The Wolves get players from all different backgrounds and ages interested in playing with us, but unfortunately the club is very limited on the kit we can supply and sadly this means that some players cannot afford to join our pack.
We are aiming to make the game
more affordable for players that show great talent and deserve to play but may
struggle with the financial commitments that come with purchasing protective
gear, registration and insurance. 

We would love to have the means to encourage more players and especially get young players involved in something productive in our community. The Wolves provide a network of security, comradery, discipline and pride for out team mates and we aim to cast the net as wide as we can reach. 
What you can do.With your help you can help the Wolves widen our reach and involve all players from every background.

what's your new film project?
YETUT LIJ /የጡት ልጅ/ is an Amharic phrase, that crudely translates to ""Child of the Breast."" It’s a term typically used to refer to any child taken in and raised by someone, other than their biological parent.The title imitates the harsh and complex realities that I want to address in this film.My story takes place in 1960’s Ethiopia, 20 years after the Italian occupation. Aynalem, a 13-year-old peasant girl, gets adopted by a wealthy judge's family and taken away from her own, with the promise of an educated upbringing and a better life. Contrary to this promise, she is instead forced to work as a domestic servant. Yet, despite the close watch and cruelty of her employers, she meets and falls in love with an ordinary police man, named Tilahun.Though, he manages to help her escape her circumstances, Tilahun finds Aynalem years later, in the clutches of another formidable captor.why are you crowd-funding?YETUT LIJ is a fictional drama with very real implications about human rights, specifically the right to love in the face of local and global forces. Though, the film is set in Ethiopia, Aynalem, for me, represents a vulnerable population of women and girls, who are trafficked exploited and enslaved all over the world.The film’s script has been finished for more than 7 years, but unfortunately, the majority of that time has been spent trying to secure financing for the film.I now have close to $500,000 secured in co-production funds, that will be lost if I am unable to raise the rest of the funds that I need to start shooting on-location in Ethiopia. In order to ensure this does not happen, I need a minimum of $500,000 in matching funds to help finance the YETUT LIJ production.why do you need all that money?Though $500,000 is no small favor to ask of you, it does make for a small budget.Having directed and produced many of my past productions abroad, I can attest that filming on-location, especially in Africa, is expensive. But I know that with a minimum of $1 million, I can achieve the same level of production value that I have demonstrated with past films, like TEZA (2008), winner of the Golden Stallion Award at FESPACO and the special jury prize at the Venice Film Festival, among other recognition.Award-winning films of this caliber would generally cost tens of millions of dollars, but I take pride in my ability to accomplish more with less.Your matching contributions, will go directly toward the expenses of filming on-location (54%), namely, air travel, ground transportation & lodging. Though most of the actors will already be in Ethiopia, some of the cast and most of the crew will need to be flown in, as will most of our equipment (29%).Cast & crew salary (17%) also includes training opportunities for 3-4 emerging filmmakers.why should I support you?By asking you to support the YETUT LIJ production, I am not just asking you to help me make my film, I am asking you to make a statement about the kind of films that you want to support, and the kind of films that you want to see.For over 40 years, I’ve worked as an independent filmmaker, fighting tooth-and-nail to tell personal stories that I feel passionate about. YETUT LIJ is no different.  Under my companies Negod Gwad Productions and Mypheduh Films, Inc. respectively, I have produced and distributed, such critically-acclaimed and award-winning films as, TEZA, SANKOFA, ASHES & EMBERS, BUSH MAMA and the Cannes Classic, HARVEST 3000 YEARS.I made these high-value, low-budget films by applying skills that I developed during my film school days at UCLA, where I worked alongside other independent filmmakers of color, like Charles Burnett, Billy Woodberry and Larry Clark.The historical circumstances that we found ourselves in, at that time in 1960's America, forced us to be creative and innovative with our production techniques. To make films that we could claim as our own, stories that reflected our own cultural accents, we had to learn how to operate outside of the commercial and mainstream institutions.Do your homework. Watch my past films, and those of my contemporaries. Then, decide for yourself, whether or not our work warrants your support. Just know that we cannot continue to create these films without you.

After each screening, viewers, especially African and African-American viewers, would be so moved by the film that they would dig into their pockets and offer $5, $10, whatever they had, just to help keep the film in theaters and expand its distribution.Galvanized by the reception of that film, my wife Shirikiana Aina, a fellow filmmaker, my sister Selome, and I established it’s namesake, Sankofa Video & Books Cafe, in Washington, D.C., right across from Howard University, where I have taught film since 1975. Sankofa, the place, has become what I like to call “a liberated space:” a base of operations for Negod Gwad productions and a setting to engage critical discussion, not just around my films, but also around the work of other artists and intellectuals.With the YETUT LIJ film campaign, I hope to inspire the same grassroots energy and engagement that made SANKOFA a success.

</h3><h3>
</h3><p>Франсис Форд Копола казва, че правенето на филм е като рисуване с армия. </p><p>За да се случи точно такъв филм е необходима просто чета
сърцати хора. Работим с
консултанти-историци, колекционери, родолюбци от форум Традиция и съвременни ""хайдушки"" чети. Всеки автентичен детайл
от филма изисква отношение:
ятагани и каракулаци, преднопълнещи пушки, носии, къщи. За да  пренесем зрителите в 19 век.<br/></p><p>Изборът на актьори се оказа малко като избор за истински хайдути! Издирвахме изненадващи, неочаквани лица, някои дори са непрофесионалисти. Те вече  репетират и тренират в лагер с потури и цървули - езда, стрелба или просто тичане по баира със силях с по 7 кила оръжия в него.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433339105/svcn9xoojowbeanz9lsk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">HOW IS SUCH A FILM PRODUCED</span><br/></p><p>Francis Ford Coppola says: filmmaking is like painting with an army.</p><p>It takes an enthusiastic tribe to create such a film. We work with consultants, historians, collectors and fans of Bulgarian traditions, who really amaze us with the fire they carry in their hearts, just like the 19c. rebels did. Every little detail in this film requires attention: we have to restore original weaponry, traditional costumes and houses... so they work as a ""time machine"".<br/></p><p>The casting was a little bit like casting for real rebels. We searched for surprising faces, some of them even non-professionals. They already rehearse and train in a special camp dressed in 19c. clothes: shooting, riding or just running uphill, carrying 7 kilo weapons.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433339048/kotwhwomugpup1xduhgo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">ЗА КАКВО СА НИ ТЕЗИ СРЕДСТВА</span><br/></p>
<p>Основната част от финансирането на филма е осигурена със спечелването на
държавна субсидия от Национален Филмов Център, ко-продуцентите Дрийм Тийм Филмс и нови партньори и спонсори с жар в сърцето. Но
исторически филми се правят рядко по очевидни причини. Една част от бюджета все още липсва. С наличният - филмът ще бъде заснет в убийствен снимачен график, при който раните няма да са само грим по актьорите. Всеки лев е от
значение за качеството!<br/></p><p><b>НАШАТА ЦЕЛ</b>: При събирането на 90,000$ с твоя помощ компромиси няма да има и ще спасиш екипа от унищожение!<br/></p><b>ЕКСТРА ЦЕЛ 1: </b>Ако ни помогнеш да съберем 140,000$, ще разполагаме с 3 дни повече

<p>The film won funding from the Bulgarian National Film
Center and is also backed up by co-producers Dream Team Films and generous partners and sponsors. But period films
in Bulgaria are rare for a reason. We are still missing a small but necessary part of the budget.
Every single dollar counts! With the current budget VOEVODA will be shot in an impossible schedule. Scars will not be only actors’ make-up, we are
afraid. <br/></p>
<p><b>OUR GOAL:</b> When your contributions reach <span>90,000$ - the quality rises with no compromises! And you
will be saving the crew!  </span>
</p>
<p><b>STRETCH GOAL 1:</b> If you help us get to 140,000$, we
will have 3 more days for  shooting the battle scenes. Invest in more action and surprises!</p>
<p><b>STRETCH GOAL 2:</b> If you help us get to 150,000$ together we
will restore part of the 200 y.o. primary school in Zheravna 
Cultural
Reserve, that could not live through the last winter snow. Once a 
school, now - a gallery, in September - a film 
set. And it will last after us!<br/></p>

Forced to leave home she discovers the fighter in herself but she has to pay the price. A film about standing up for one's choices and about chieftainship through the struggles of a mother.

BASED ON REAL CHARACTERS AND A SHORT STORY BY                        BULGARIAN CLASSIC WRITER NIKOLAY HAITOV.                                                     SHOOTING: FALL 2015. RELEASE: WINTER 2016/2017.
СКЪПИ ПРИЯТЕЛЮ, вярваме, че не трябва да оставим уникални истории да потънат в забрава. 
Знаеш 
ли, че България има женски аналог на Робин Худ и Уилям Уолъс? Не една, а над 50 жени оставят хурка и грабват пушка в борба за справедливост и нито една не става редови хайдутин, а всички - воеводи на мъжки чети. Николай Хайтов, по чийто разказ е написан сценарият, нарича това феномен.Подготвяме се
5 години за да направим автентичен хайдушки филм и в течение на работата открихме вселена, която искаме да съхраним и споделим.

We believe that we should not let exceptional stories fall

of Robin Hood and William Wallace? Not one or two,
but more than 50 women fought for justice and became not just regular rebels, but leaders of gangs - voevodas. A phenomenon
few know about.

за отстояването.

Румена Воeвода е реална историческа личност. Преди век и
половина, все едно е днес, тя се бори да помири мъжките с женските си качества,
бунтовника - с майката и любимата, в конфликт с нормите на обществото и на
собствените си другари. Как  се превръща шайката разбойници в
робин-худовци? Ако
отстояването на себе си ти коства най-скъпото, би ли платил цената?THIS IS A FILM ABOUT...standing up.
Roumena Voevoda is a real person from 19th century Bulgaria. 150 years ago, as if it is today, she strives to reconcile the warrior and the female nature within herself, the fighter - with the mother and the lover against the status quo and her own comrades. What  transforms the outlaw thugs into Robin-Hood-type of fighters? If standing up for your choices comes at a dear price, would you pay it?ТОЗИ ФИЛМ НЕ...
...следва клишето ‘хайдути се борят с турци
и мюсюлмани’. Интересува ни отношението чoвeк-човек. Не в един случай от историята свой - свой убива, а ръка се подава и от враг - с респект.
...ползва бутафорен реквизит, оръжия и
стилизирани носии. С помощта на ентусиасти и колекционери на съкровища от Възраждането - съвременни хайдути - ние възстановяваме истински реликви и умения от време оно. 
...е холивудски екшън със супер герои и огромни масовки. Нашите герои са земни и корави, а повечето ни актьори са или малко познати лица, или хора от живота, които ще видим за първи път на екран.
THIS FILM IS NOT ABOUT......the cliche rebels fight against the Ottomans only. We are interested in the human relationships. Not once in history the traitor was once a friend and an enemy becomes an ally - out of respect....artificial props, costumes and weapons. With the help of collectors who will take part in the film - we restore real treasures of national heritage. ...copying Hollywood action with super heroes and giant battle scenes. We feature down-to-earth characters and actors mostly unknown and fresh for the big screen.

КАК СЕ ПРАВИ ТАКЪВ ФИЛМ

Франсис Форд Копола казва, че правенето на филм е като рисуване с армия. За да се случи точно такъв филм е необходима просто чета
сърцати хора. Работим с
консултанти-историци, колекционери, родолюбци от форум Традиция и съвременни ""хайдушки"" чети. Всеки автентичен детайл
от филма изисква отношение:
ятагани и каракулаци, преднопълнещи пушки, носии, къщи. За да  пренесем зрителите в 19 век.Изборът на актьори се оказа малко като избор за истински хайдути! Издирвахме изненадващи, неочаквани лица, някои дори са непрофесионалисти. Те вече  репетират и тренират в лагер с потури и цървули - езда, стрелба или просто тичане по баира със силях с по 7 кила оръжия в него.HOW IS SUCH A FILM PRODUCEDFrancis Ford Coppola says: filmmaking is like painting with an army.It takes an enthusiastic tribe to create such a film. We work with consultants, historians, collectors and fans of Bulgarian traditions, who really amaze us with the fire they carry in their hearts, just like the 19c. rebels did. Every little detail in this film requires attention: we have to restore original weaponry, traditional costumes and houses... so they work as a ""time machine"".The casting was a little bit like casting for real rebels. We searched for surprising faces, some of them even non-professionals. They already rehearse and train in a special camp dressed in 19c. clothes: shooting, riding or just running uphill, carrying 7 kilo weapons.ЗА КАКВО СА НИ ТЕЗИ СРЕДСТВА
Основната част от финансирането на филма е осигурена със спечелването на
държавна субсидия от Национален Филмов Център, ко-продуцентите Дрийм Тийм Филмс и нови партньори и спонсори с жар в сърцето. Но
исторически филми се правят рядко по очевидни причини. Една част от бюджета все още липсва. С наличният - филмът ще бъде заснет в убийствен снимачен график, при който раните няма да са само грим по актьорите. Всеки лев е от
значение за качеството!НАШАТА ЦЕЛ: При събирането на 90,000$ с твоя помощ компромиси няма да има и ще спасиш екипа от унищожение!ЕКСТРА ЦЕЛ 1: Ако ни помогнеш да съберем 140,000$, ще разполагаме с 3 дни повече 
снимачно време за екшън сцените, а оттам - с повече каскади и изненади!ЕКСТРА ЦЕЛ 2: Ако с твоя помощ съберем 150,000$, заедно ще вдигнем отново падналия от 
снеговете 4 метров дувар на училището в архитектурен резерват Жеравна, 
понастоящем галерия, а през септември - декор във филма Воевода. За да остане нещо след нас!Освен с добро дело можеш да се похвалиш на своите другари и с хайдушки ДАРОВЕ от филма, виж вдясно: PERKS!
Очакваме те в четата! Заедно с теб ще направим този
филм специален.WHAT DO WE NEED THIS MONEY FOR
The film won funding from the Bulgarian National Film
Center and is also backed up by co-producers Dream Team Films and generous partners and sponsors. But period films
in Bulgaria are rare for a reason. We are still missing a small but necessary part of the budget.
Every single dollar counts! With the current budget VOEVODA will be shot in an impossible schedule. Scars will not be only actors’ make-up, we are
afraid. 
OUR GOAL: When your contributions reach 90,000$ - the quality rises with no compromises! And you
will be saving the crew!  

STRETCH GOAL 1: If you help us get to 140,000$, we
will have 3 more days for  shooting the battle scenes. Invest in more action and surprises!
STRETCH GOAL 2: If you help us get to 150,000$ together we
will restore part of the 200 y.o. primary school in Zheravna 
Cultural
Reserve, that could not live through the last winter snow. Once a 
school, now - a gallery, in September - a film 
set. And it will last after us!
You can do good now and tell all your friends
about it. And apart from the good karma, you can get rebellious PERKS in return –
check them to the right and below!
Join the gang! Let's make this film special!

Четата ни си има оригинална униформа, която ще
имаш и ти! С дизайнера Мира Бъчварова сътворихме тениски с традиционни елементи за времето, през което
не сме по хайдушки премени. Пафти за жените, пълен силях - хайдушки кожен колан за оръжие - за мъжете – освен
етно красотата, древните български символи имат сила, която пази енергията на
тялото в най-важната му част. 

ETHNO T-SHIRTS VOEVODA
Our gang has its crew
uniform and now you also have it! We created these unique T-shirts with
traditional Bulgarian elements to wear something while not in period costumes with the help of designer Mira Bachvarova.
For women – pafti decoration and fully
equipted silyah (Bulgarian baldric) for men. Apart from reviving the traditional beauty of these
decorations, we use the power of the ancient symbols they carry and convey it to
the body at its most important parts.
ДАР ЕДИН ВЪЗРОЖДЕНСКИ НАКИТ

Автентичните накити от 19в.
се намират вече само в
колекциите на фенове на българските традиции. Някога майсторите правили нещата така,
че да издържат вечно, а
символиката им е архаична и магическа.
Гривна–рогатка, или трепка, или
наушник, или дамски брачен накит – според наличностите... Даряваме те с уникат-накит срещу помощта ти и
се радваме, че отива в ръце, които творят добро.

ANTIQUE

These are authentic treasures from the 19 c.,which
nowadays are only to find in the hands of collectors. They are exquisitely
crafted to last forever, the way things were made in the old days and bring magic
to the lady, who wears them. Rogatka-bracelet

jewelry – upon availability... Your help is priceless for us and we are happy to
give you such a treasure in return. We believe it goes in a hand that creates
good.
ДАР ЖЕНСКИ/МЪЖКИ КОСТЮМ ""ИГРАЛ"" ВЪВ
ФИЛМА
Български автентични над 100 годишни носии, вече на изчезване. Златната сърма, с която са извезани женските, вече не се произвежда. Дълговечните
им символи и красота днес са грубо
стилизирани в кичозни подобия.
Можеш заедно с нас да спасиш ИСТИНСКА ДРЕХА ОТ СТАРИ ВРЕМЕНА и да се грижиш за нея
с уважението, което й се полага. И да блеснеш сред гостите! 

AN AUTHENTIC COSTUME FROM THE FILM

garments from the 19c., embroidered with golden thread, nowhere to be found
today. During the last century, their ancient symbolic and beauty have been
manipulated into kitsch custom clothes. Together with us you can save an
AUTHENTIC GARMENT FROM OLD TIMES and take care of it with the due respect,
shining in it at appropriate events.
ДАР СИЛЯХ С ЕДИН ХАЙДУШКИ РЕКВИЗИТ-ИЗНЕНАДА

и хайдушки потреби. Пази мъжкия кръст от студа и злобата на света. Доверени
майстори ръчно изработват силяси за филма и коват ключови елементи от реквизита

<p>Hey there, hi there! My name is Schro errrr. Let me hand this off to HH's director, Bryan Ribeiro.... *ahem* Hey there guys! Sorry about that. So, HH is our first feature. We've been prepping this film for months but production is going to be a massive undertaking. Pre-production is wrapped and post-production is covered. From here on end, we're in your hands. And production is starting in August! </p>

After playing visual novel adventure video game, Virtue’s Last Reward for the 3DS, I was inspired to tell a similar story. Virtue's Last Reward tries to explore humanity put into a pressure cooker and scopes in on what happens as a result. This kind of story is important. It examines people and watches their ability to survive unfold as they struggle with numerous obstacles. I wanted to explore the idea of trust and the eternal strife we have with one another. In HH, compounding the situation with an exaggerated setting, crazy omniscient cat head, a time limit, and challenging puzzles, the characters will be put to a test that will challenge their faith, trust, love, fear and understanding of each other. Would you help or hinder your fellows to survive?  </span></p>

What happens when you put combustible elements like people, a time limit, puzzles, death-inducing watches, and a crazy omniscient virtual warden together? The results are quite sporadic and, in a way, beautiful. Its easy to assume people will work together and try and help but paranoia can easily settle in. HH isn't special in that its a psychological thriller with sci-fi elements. I believe its special because of the characters and interactions involved; how they work together. How Schrödinger<i> </i>can entice someone or how a character can justify hindering their partner or how love can be sown in 90 minutes.  These moments of humanity truly show something fascinating about the human ability. <br/></p>

<p>HH depicts the story of prisoners trying to escape a mysterious facility. Vi, an amnesiac with a penchant for puzzles, wakes up to find herself locked in a room with a watch she can’t remove and a man she’s never met. Without knowing where they are or why they’re there, Vi and the rest of the prisoners attempt to solve brainteasing puzzles, earn points for freedom, and survive the maniacal master program Schro, a giant virtual cat head. <br/></p>

</p>
<p>A type of game theory, the prisoner’s dilemma is the cornerstone of HH. During multiple points in the film, partnered prisoners have to choose one of two options, <b>help </b>or<b> hinder</b>. In our version of the prisoner’s dilemma, titled HH, each option will give or take points that go towards the freedom of each prisoner. So, an example, would be if both me and my partner, who were strangers, happened to gel and we decided to “help” each other. We would both gain two points. If we didn’t trust each other, and decided to “hinder” each other, we wouldn’t gain any points. But if I chose help and my partner chose hinder, I would lose one point and my partner would three gain points. Egos, combustible personalities, and trust will mix and match these choices and characters and produce massively different results. </p>

I've learned that budget can be like water sometimes. It can crash and spike up to new levels like a tsunami or it can come in gently like a ripple. But the team has a decided at a concrete $8000. Though, it is a lot to ask for and it can be confidently said that mainly location, props/gear, and cast/crew will take up the majority to honestly deliver the best out of each of them- 50% for location, 20% for cast/crew and props/gear, and 10% for festivals. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""></span></p>

</div></div>","Hey there, hi there! My name is Schro errrr. Let me hand this off to HH's director, Bryan Ribeiro.... *ahem* Hey there guys! Sorry about that. So, HH is our first feature. We've been prepping this film for months but production is going to be a massive undertaking. Pre-production is wrapped and post-production is covered. From here on end, we're in your hands. And production is starting in August! 


As The Matrix is about the understanding of the human conscience; Ex Machina about the human identity, and Blade Runner about the human soul; HH is the story about the human capacity to struggle. After playing visual novel adventure video game, Virtue’s Last Reward for the 3DS, I was inspired to tell a similar story. Virtue's Last Reward tries to explore humanity put into a pressure cooker and scopes in on what happens as a result. This kind of story is important. It examines people and watches their ability to survive unfold as they struggle with numerous obstacles. I wanted to explore the idea of trust and the eternal strife we have with one another. In HH, compounding the situation with an exaggerated setting, crazy omniscient cat head, a time limit, and challenging puzzles, the characters will be put to a test that will challenge their faith, trust, love, fear and understanding of each other. Would you help or hinder your fellows to survive?  
                                         This film is an attempt at an introspective look at conflict. What happens when you put combustible elements like people, a time limit, puzzles, death-inducing watches, and a crazy omniscient virtual warden together? The results are quite sporadic and, in a way, beautiful. Its easy to assume people will work together and try and help but paranoia can easily settle in. HH isn't special in that its a psychological thriller with sci-fi elements. I believe its special because of the characters and interactions involved; how they work together. How Schrödinger can entice someone or how a character can justify hindering their partner or how love can be sown in 90 minutes.  These moments of humanity truly show something fascinating about the human ability. 




HH depicts the story of prisoners trying to escape a mysterious facility. Vi, an amnesiac with a penchant for puzzles, wakes up to find herself locked in a room with a watch she can’t remove and a man she’s never met. Without knowing where they are or why they’re there, Vi and the rest of the prisoners attempt to solve brainteasing puzzles, earn points for freedom, and survive the maniacal master program Schro, a giant virtual cat head. 





A type of game theory, the prisoner’s dilemma is the cornerstone of HH. During multiple points in the film, partnered prisoners have to choose one of two options, help or hinder. In our version of the prisoner’s dilemma, titled HH, each option will give or take points that go towards the freedom of each prisoner. So, an example, would be if both me and my partner, who were strangers, happened to gel and we decided to “help” each other. We would both gain two points. If we didn’t trust each other, and decided to “hinder” each other, we wouldn’t gain any points. But if I chose help and my partner chose hinder, I would lose one point and my partner would three gain points. Egos, combustible personalities, and trust will mix and match these choices and characters and produce massively different results. 
   
To imagine HH you have to imagine films Cube and Saw put together in addition to a pixelated cat head with Robin Williams's persona mixed in for good measure. This kind of visual scope is bigger then anything I've ever done. Long dull hallways, open rooms for fights, and very specific utilitarian rooms for puzzles need to be fully encapsulated. I've learned that budget can be like water sometimes. It can crash and spike up to new levels like a tsunami or it can come in gently like a ripple. But the team has a decided at a concrete $8000. Though, it is a lot to ask for and it can be confidently said that mainly location, props/gear, and cast/crew will take up the majority to honestly deliver the best out of each of them- 50% for location, 20% for cast/crew and props/gear, and 10% for festivals. 


Since the locations require a special touch of sci-fi and mystery to it, we'll be arranging a lot of the rooms in multiple locations throughout NY and NJ. Some at a school, others in a mostly abandoned building, basements, rooftops, and so much more! 

The characters have to solve puzzles and each puzzle, located in a specific room, has its own quirk to it. Each puzzle will test the character's mental capacity while hinting at the bigger plot. If you think you may have a prop essential to the film, please check out the link below. This includes dice, blank books, streamers, bottles, and lots of household items you may have! https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/1UADMH5LBUOXC/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go_o?The rewards are some of the most fun parts of making a film because, often enough, you're not just making a film, you're building a brand. A universe with its own characters, mindsets; its very own gravity. That can lead to a plethora of untapped resources. One of which is a prequel comic book that goes onto to divulge more information about the mysterious complex that holds HH's prisoners. It also gives us insight into Shrodinger as well. Check out the rewards below to get an idea of all the great incentives we have. 
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    

Having crowd-funded my short film last year, Modieval, on Kickstarter, I was lucky enough to reach my goal and learn a ton about filmmaking and campaigning. I was doubly lucky for my film to get numerous nominations, awards, and venues throughout 2014-2015. You can find it here: https://vimeo.com/bryanribeiro/modieval  



HH has a very talented and diverse cast and crew. Respected theater nerds, video game geeks, experienced and intelligent filmmakers and awesomely talented throughout, the cast and crew we've obtained are absolutely the best! We're thrilled to be working with them as they seem with us. Check out the players yo! 

                                                     






Amelia Dudley - Vi - an amnesiac with a penchant for puzzles. Amelia is a Baltimore native and recent graduate of NYU Tisch School of the Arts where she received her BFA in acting. She knew she wanted to be an actor from a very young age, as it would allow her to continue playing dress up well into adulthood. When not onstage she enjoys cats (both on the Internet and in real life) and trying to figure out which of Shakespeare's plays would work best in space (Coriolanus, probably). What drew her most to the film is the examination of the behaviors of ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances; the high-stakes nature of the games test the limits of each character's humanity, as well as identity. Amelia is thrilled to be a part of this project and to be working with this amazing team.""Website: www.ameliadudley.com                                       



Reginald Keith Jackson - Ray - an emotional but enduring jokester. Reginald is an alum of the American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA) and graduate of The New School for Public Engagement where he focused on cinema studies. Born and raised in Aurora, Colorado, Reginald ventured to New York City with dreams of becoming a professional actor, screenwriter, and poet. ""I was immediately drawn to this film because of its mature, existential tone while still appealing to a casual sci-fi-loving audience. I have also had the pleasure of working with Bryan on his previous short film, Modieval, where I witnessed his unique style and post-modern take on storytelling. With a kick-ass script masking thought-provoking themes, and an incredibly imaginative director, I know this project is bound to be a real gem; and I can't begin to express how exciting it is to be a part of it."" 
                                          
Corrie Legge - Matty - a sweet, unassuming nymph with hidden intentions. Corrie was born and raise in a small suburb of Portland, ME (the real Portland). She has been performing on stage and screen since she was old enough to create improvised action films with brother as her co-star and her father as DP. In addition to acting, she loves anything outdoors including skiing and triathlons. She is also a die-hard Patriots fan (please don't hold it against her). ""What interested me most about HH was the psychology behind each character. The film makes you wonder, what would I do if that were me? There are no evil characters, and no saint; they are simply people trying to survive in unimaginable circumstances. I'm particularly excited to explore the many conflicting layers that create Matty. She's such a incredibly character; I can't wait to bring her to life.""

Kenneth Kriheli - J.T. - a shy, gentle giant with sparks of insight. A native of Rego Park, Queens, Kenneth is fresh out of NYU Tisch with a B.A. (Bad Assery) in Cinema Studies and minors in Music and Film Production and is still figuring out what to do with his life. He enjoys cooking and eating, acting, animation, being on film sets, nerdgasms, reading books and articles out loud, keyboard music, water, talking and humming to himself, independent cinemas, weird references, and opera. Please don't ask him what his favorite movie is. While I fit the shy giant archetype pretty easily, I was eager to play JT before I'd finished reading the script precisely because he proved so much more than that. His quiet humanity convinced me that Bryan at least knew how to write characters, if not a whole feature-length film! And of course, he's done both.""                 
                                               


Alysia Dorhout - Schrödinger- A stage and film actress based in NYC, Alysia is an alum of the American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA) and graduate of The New School for Public engagement. Favorite On-screen credits include Modieval (Short Film), A River Through Milkwoods(Feature). Favorite stage credits include: Moliere's ""Tartuffe"" (Elmire), and Tinkerbell Theater Company's puppet-theater ""Cinderella (Stepsisters). ""My interest in 'Help and Hinder' was sparked by a familiar and friendly invitation. Having worked with Bryan before, I was stoked to know that he was up to his unique style of filmmaking again. Having attended the first couple of readings of the film and getting myself worked up over the awesomeness of Schrödinger, Bryan asked for my interpretation...and here we are! I am delighted to bring this crazy cat to life with the help of a few espresso shots and a spark of madness.""


                                              


Louis Cox - Director of Photography - ""I'm a writer and aspiring director. 
I work at The New School, where I’ve earned the nickname: “the lighting guru” while
instructing for a wide variety of film production courses.  I’ve also
worked at The International Center of Photography in midtown.  I've crewed
on more independent and student films than I can count.  I work hard; I
learn a lot. 
I was drawn to this project
because of my friendship with the director, Bryan.  I believe him to be a talented and wonderfully astute
observer of the world that surrounds him, as well as a hard-worker when it
comes to accomplishing his goals. 
One time when I was a kid I
put a metal toy in the microwave even though I knew it was dangerous, I suppose
I just wanted to see for myself what would actually happen: a miniaturized
lightning bolt materialized out of thin air and struck the toy. I learned my lesson. ""

Hello everyone my name is Rob and I'm excited to work on this wonderful project. Two things I bring to the project is a passion for retro gaming and making the sure the project goes smoothly for everyone involved. Here are some random facts about me. My favorite food is mahi mahi tacos and my favorite film as of right now is The Big Chill. When it comes to retro gaming my system is the Sega Genesis. I recently just beat Alien 3 for it, a great movie title and rare game for the system. When I'm not gaming I love watching HBO, my favorite show as of right now is Ballers with Dwayne Johnson.

Brandon attended two art schools in North Carolina before moving to New York City and transferring to Parsons in 2012 to finish his BFA in Illustration in 2014. His work is a playful blend of haunting, sci-fi, and comical elements that often comments on politics and society through pop surrealism. What drew me to this project is the strong narrative. I love the descriptions of the rooms and the action, because it makes me feel like I'm watching a well composed movie that has me wanting more and builds in suspense.

<p>My name is Shameka Cole...But my long time nickname and Industry name is Meca Cole. I started out in the Entertainment Industry as a Music Video Director. Which is my second love. My first love is Film and Television. Every since I could remember I was able to visually create stories and movie/tv scenario. As a child I would write books and draw the pictures...lol...the good ole days. Needless to say my creative mind is still on full speed. </p>
<p>There are countless Movies and Television Series out here. Most of them are ultimately the same concept. For example, there are Medical Series such as Grey's Anatomy. Law Enforcement Series such as Blue Bloods and Government/Political  Series is such as Scandal. I am defiantly a fan of all of the above...but what if there was a TV Series about oh I don't know maybe ANYTHING other than the same concepts. Would it catch your attention? of course it would!! Well, consider ME to the rescue!! lol.</p>
<p>I have created a ground breaking TV Series geared to capture the minds of suspense, thriller and drama lovers all over the world. Get ready for a  completely different concept, plot and not to mention betrayal,lies,motives,pasts,reasons why and OMG moments!!! The suspense filled TV Series I am referring to my friends  is <b>BACKGROUND</b>. <b>BACKGROUND</b> was born two years ago while I was working a job I completely hated (not to mention it bored me half to death). But now I am ready to share this amazing series that has so many people already asking ""what happens next"" with all of you. Trust me young and older, Male or Female it makes no difference<b> BACKGROUND</b> is the next HIT! But I need your help! </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>BACKGROUND</b> is a TV Series. Which means the story unfolds over a period Episodes and Seasons. My goal is to produce the ""Pilot"" which is the first Episode and present it to Netflix by the end of this year 2015. This is a realistic and doable goal...but I will need your help!! This is the process in chronological order.</p> <ul> <li>
<b>Produce the ""Pilot""</b> which is the first Episode. In order to do so I have to <span style=""background-color: initial;""> hire the Production Team for a 6 day shoot..</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">.the actual cost is $20,000.</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Secure Location</b> My goal is to bring in Sponsors for Location, wardrobe,makeup, hair...However, if I am not able to get Sponsors I will need to pay for their services. The maximum budget for such is $5,000.</span></li>
<li>
<b>Main Actors Fee's and Travel Expenses </b>I was blessed to land my Main Actress. A seasoned SAG Actress  already known in the Entertainment Industry which means she has required fees, also I would need to fly her into Atlanta, GA and take care of all the Travel Expenses. The Maximum budget for such is $5,000.</li>
<li>
<b>Casting Directors</b> play a huge part in hiring the most talented Actors...My maximum budget for such is $2,000.</li>
<li>
<b>Miscellaneous Expenses</b> also known as petty cash <span style=""background-color: initial;"">because on a production things happen</span> such as needing <span style=""background-color: initial;"">more food </span>to feed the production team and cast to needing to buy an extra Hard drive to load more footage...for such I have to set aside a budget of $3,000.</li>
<li>
<b>Sounds like a lot??</b> it is..but for experienced Production people like myself its actually not a lot at all. However, each part of the puzzle is vital in making a quality production happen.</li>
<li>

My name is Shameka Cole...But my long time nickname and Industry name is Meca Cole. I started out in the Entertainment Industry as a Music Video Director. Which is my second love. My first love is Film and Television. Every since I could remember I was able to visually create stories and movie/tv scenario. As a child I would write books and draw the pictures...lol...the good ole days. Needless to say my creative mind is still on full speed. 
There are countless Movies and Television Series out here. Most of them are ultimately the same concept. For example, there are Medical Series such as Grey's Anatomy. Law Enforcement Series such as Blue Bloods and Government/Political  Series is such as Scandal. I am defiantly a fan of all of the above...but what if there was a TV Series about oh I don't know maybe ANYTHING other than the same concepts. Would it catch your attention? of course it would!! Well, consider ME to the rescue!! lol.
I have created a ground breaking TV Series geared to capture the minds of suspense, thriller and drama lovers all over the world. Get ready for a  completely different concept, plot and not to mention betrayal,lies,motives,pasts,reasons why and OMG moments!!! The suspense filled TV Series I am referring to my friends  is BACKGROUND. BACKGROUND was born two years ago while I was working a job I completely hated (not to mention it bored me half to death). But now I am ready to share this amazing series that has so many people already asking ""what happens next"" with all of you. Trust me young and older, Male or Female it makes no difference BACKGROUND is the next HIT! But I need your help!    What We Need & What You Get
BACKGROUND is a TV Series. Which means the story unfolds over a period Episodes and Seasons. My goal is to produce the ""Pilot"" which is the first Episode and present it to Netflix by the end of this year 2015. This is a realistic and doable goal...but I will need your help!! This is the process in chronological order.  
Produce the ""Pilot"" which is the first Episode. In order to do so I have to  hire the Production Team for a 6 day shoot...the actual cost is $20,000.

Secure Location My goal is to bring in Sponsors for Location, wardrobe,makeup, hair...However, if I am not able to get Sponsors I will need to pay for their services. The maximum budget for such is $5,000.

Main Actors Fee's and Travel Expenses I was blessed to land my Main Actress. A seasoned SAG Actress  already known in the Entertainment Industry which means she has required fees, also I would need to fly her into Atlanta, GA and take care of all the Travel Expenses. The Maximum budget for such is $5,000.

Casting Directors play a huge part in hiring the most talented Actors...My maximum budget for such is $2,000.

Miscellaneous Expenses also known as petty cash because on a production things happen such as needing more food to feed the production team and cast to needing to buy an extra Hard drive to load more footage...for such I have to set aside a budget of $3,000.

Sounds like a lot?? it is..but for experienced Production people like myself its actually not a lot at all. However, each part of the puzzle is vital in making a quality production happen.

So what do you get for believing in BACKGROUND by funding and or helping create a massive BUZZ!!! I'm glad you asked...because your going to LOVE the PERKS of being a BACKGROUND DIE HARD!!!


Autographed Pictures of the Main Character.

Exclusive BTS (behind the scenes) footage of the production!!

BACKGROUND pens, and other fun accessories!!
A chance to WIN Dinner with ME the Creator, Writer and Director of the next HIT TV Series!!!

Participation in BACKGROUNDS Social Media Contest...The Winner will get a chance to spend a day on set!!!!
Grand Prize such as winning a chance to be an extra in the actual Episode!!!
 ARE YOU EXCITED YET!!! I AM!!! I honestly have the utmost faith in BACKGROUND'S DIE HARD'S helping me fund and create a massive BUZZ for BACKGROUND. However, if BACKGROUND does not reach its goal we will be extremely great full to all the DIE HARD'S who have supported BACKGROUND and use the funds we were blessed to raise to  continue to   produce this incredible, sit on the edge of your seat TV Series.    The Impact BACKGROUND'S campaign will also consist of creating a massive BUZZ on all social media platforms...such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest. I really need your help to push and spread the word about our campaign on Indiegogo. With out you guys this campaign will not be a success.

<p><b>Who we are</b></p>
<p>Inside Life Outside is a project hosted by three third year Arts and Events Management students at the Arts University Bournemouth. The aim of the project is to creatively share the stories of the homeless, and through this, raise awareness of a contemporary and serious issue.</p>
<p>Inside Life Outside comprised of a set of workshops for both Big Issue vendors and residents of the BCHA St Pauls Shelter in Bournemouth. These workshops were hosted by professional arts facilitators and focused on exploring and telling the stories of what it is like to be homeless. The artworks and stories produced at these workshops have been into a small publication to share their stories. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Our Legacy Project</b></p>
<p>The Inside Life Outside team were humbled at the amount of positive feedback we received from the participants after every workshop. </p>
<p>“When are you coming back?”, “Thank you so much”, “It was great fun”.</p>
<p>Frustrated that we had neither time nor funds to continue hosting workshops, we decided to create a <b>legacy project</b>.</p>
<p>Working with the BCHA and AUB, we are hoping to continue offering regular art workshops for the residents of the BCHA St Pauls Shelter as of September. </p>
<p>A number of things are already in place:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Interest and enthusiasm from residents at the BCHA St Pauls Shelter</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Support from AUB tutors, who will continue to oversee the project</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Time dedicated by Arts and Events Management students, who will take on the Legacy project as part of their degree</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The one thing we are missing is the money to fund the workshops! </p>
<p>Currently, the Inside Life Outside team is busy setting up a fundraising page. </p>
<p>It costs <b>£75 to host each workshop</b>. This covers hiring a professional arts facilitator for the afternoon (at a discounted charity price!) and the art materials required.</p>
<p>Our goal is to <b>raise enough money for 10 more workshops</b>. We are setting a fundraising aim of <b>£750</b>. </p>
<p>We need your help to make this happen.</p>
<p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Who we are
Inside Life Outside is a project hosted by three third year Arts and Events Management students at the Arts University Bournemouth. The aim of the project is to creatively share the stories of the homeless, and through this, raise awareness of a contemporary and serious issue.
Inside Life Outside comprised of a set of workshops for both Big Issue vendors and residents of the BCHA St Pauls Shelter in Bournemouth. These workshops were hosted by professional arts facilitators and focused on exploring and telling the stories of what it is like to be homeless. The artworks and stories produced at these workshops have been into a small publication to share their stories. 

Our Legacy Project
The Inside Life Outside team were humbled at the amount of positive feedback we received from the participants after every workshop. 
“When are you coming back?”, “Thank you so much”, “It was great fun”.
Frustrated that we had neither time nor funds to continue hosting workshops, we decided to create a legacy project.
Working with the BCHA and AUB, we are hoping to continue offering regular art workshops for the residents of the BCHA St Pauls Shelter as of September. 
A number of things are already in place:

Interest and enthusiasm from residents at the BCHA St Pauls Shelter
Support from AUB tutors, who will continue to oversee the project
Time dedicated by Arts and Events Management students, who will take on the Legacy project as part of their degree

The one thing we are missing is the money to fund the workshops! 
Currently, the Inside Life Outside team is busy setting up a fundraising page. 
It costs £75 to host each workshop. This covers hiring a professional arts facilitator for the afternoon (at a discounted charity price!) and the art materials required.
Our goal is to raise enough money for 10 more workshops. We are setting a fundraising aim of £750. 
We need your help to make this happen.

The Impact
Funding an additional 10 workshops will have a great impact on the BCHA residents. 
Not only is participating in art activities a fun outlet for everyone but the art workshops at the BCHA provide a positive atmosphere and time away from any troubles in the resident's lives. They encourage the development of relationships within the shelter and provide an outlet for expression. 
Inside Life Outside received a lot of feedback, a common one being ""What you're doing here is good"". 
With your help, we hope to continue having this impact. 

Thank you
Thank you to anyone who decides to donate and to anyone showing interest. We really appreciate your support and we know the residents at the BCHA do as well.

<h3>NEWS!</h3>
<p>We need $15,000 to make this film and, thanks to offline donations from Sagamok Anishnabek First Nations ($10,000), Gary Sundown of Western Door Productions ($2600), Lesley Piche ($766) and many others, we have raised about $13,000!  We still need your help.  As this campaign is about to close, we will still be collecting donations and honouring perks. For details, visit:<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.judgementfilms.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.judgementfilms.com</a></p>
<br/>Short Summary <p></p>
<p>I surround myself with people who are passionate about film making, story telling and harnessing communal creativity.  I am also engaged by stories that are fun to watch but also have a deeper message.  Lastly, I am forever incensed by the lousy portrayal of aboriginal people in film and television.  Canada's indigenous people deserve to have their stories told, to see heroes that look like them and to have their modern and historical lives talked about.<br/><br/>This project will be important to you if <u>any</u> of these are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>You think Northern Ontario artists have incredible talent and need more opportunities to collaborate and share their skills.</li>
<li>You believe that any movie genre, especially zombie horror that hits a raw visceral nerve, can also carry important political messages.</li>
<li>You like zombie movies, gritty dramas and realistic horror.</li>
</ul>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Are Doing</h3> <p></p>Laps In Judgement Films is a collaboration of over 40 actors, film makers and movie fans.  We are filming a short film called REZilience, which is the opening scene of the future full length film of the same name.   It is Canada's first and only aboriginal zombie adventure and is sure to chill, thrill and entertain while warning Canadians to take aboriginal treaty rights more seriously.<br/><br/><p><b></b></p>

Der Kurzfilm Resurgence, der in einer nicht allzufernen Zukunft spielt, erzählt von dem Willen und dem Versuch
eines Individuums, sich selbst definieren zu können und der Unmöglichkeit
dessen, alleine „gegen den Strom zu schwimmen"". Genre: Drama/Sci-Fi  

In Union there is strength
Das Kernteam von Resurgence besteht aus :
Sabrina Norte, Sarah Kristen, Verena Mühling und Esther Brestak.
Wir sind Studentinnen am SAE Institute Wien und studieren Digital Film und Animation.

Der eine oder andere wird etwas skeptisch sein bei der Vorstellung von vier Frauen, vereint in einem Team. Da
fragt man sich bestimmt, wie es möglich sein soll, dass vier Frauen mit eigener Persönlichkeit und Meinung es
schaffen, auf einen gemeinsamen Nenner zu kommen.
Genau das ist es aber, das uns ausmacht und zusammenschweißt! Aufgrund unserer unterschiedlichen Stärken ergänzen wir uns ausgezeichnet. Um unser Projekt so zu verwirklichen wie wir es geplant haben, braucht es diese Girlpower in eine Team vereint.  

Was du uns gibst & was du bekommst

Vor allem finanziell steht ihr uns zur Seite, damit wir das was wir können umsetzen, und lernen unsere Ideen, Visionen, Projekte, Ziele umzusetzen und einer Öffentlichkeit zu präsentieren. 
 
Wir möchten insgesamt 4000 Euro sammeln, damit wir alle Kosten komplett abdecken können. Es kostet alles  sehr viel Geld und wir möchten vor allem in die Ausstattung, Set, Equipment, Schauspieler, Catering investieren.

Für das Kostümbild haben wir hervorragende und talentierte Designer  von TrueYou Fashion gewinnen können: www.trueyou-fashion.com


Wir haben uns einzigartige Perks überlegt die du dir nicht entgehen lassen solltest zb.: T-Shirts, Polaroid Fotos, Besuch am Set...

   Die Folgen
Wir möchten mit dem Kurzfilm jeden, aber vor allem Jugendliche und heranwachsende Erwachsene, erreichen und dazu anregen
und animieren, ihren Standpunkt in der Gesellschaft kritisch zu überdenken. Ebenso
aber auch, sich bewusst zu werden, welchen Stellenwert Erinnerungen und Träume für
jeden individuell und in Bezug auf die Gesellschaft, in der wir leben, haben. 

Identität und deren eigene, wie kollektive, Generation bleiben zeitlebens
ein wichtiges Thema und eine stetige Aufgabe eines jeden Individuums. 
Die Frage ist, wer definiert Identität?
Wir wollen mit unserem Film einen Anstoß geben, sich selbst zu fragen, was
wir als wahr und/oder real anerkennen und warum wir das eigentlich tun. 
Etwa weil jemand anderes von uns möchte, dass wir das glauben? Sind wir gar
imstande, unsere eigene Identität, unsere eigenen Erinnerungen und Träume, die
so persönlich sind, selbst in der Hand zu halten und zu hüten?

Synopsis


'Sheltered Life' is the story of Will, a young lone survivor following a nuclear attack. Will comes across an abandoned farmhouse and finds solace with an unlikely trio, Oscar and his sister Leya and a man suffering from severe radiation poisoning, Pete. Will's far right political views quickly creates tension and dis-harmony among the group and they are unsure if they can place their trust in him, but ultimately their morality overcomes this, and they are unable to turn their backs on a human in need. 

Lonely, starving and down on his luck, Will's whole view of the world is thrown into a whirlwind of emotion, where he questions whether his own racist views are even relevant any more, let alone morally correct. Through the understanding and caring Nature of Leya and the animosity from her older brother Oscar, Will begins a journey of reflection and self discovery that is both turbulent and painful. 
Can he change the person is he? Is there any point when facing the baron waste lands and  anarchy filled cities that now occupy the once beautiful country?
 Topped with the fear of an approaching group of strangers that may be hostile, the group are faced with the difficult decision of staying put or putting faith and trust into Will and following him further into the mountains and safe from danger.

</h3> <p>Casey S and Kayla D grew up in a tight knit, rural part of Rhode Island. Around the age of 14 they started exploring The Dr. Joseph H. Ladd Center, locally known as The Ladd School. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431825138/wjbup4uacmuqwoachxie.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It was almost a right of passage to sneak onto the property with a small flash light, and wander around the old buildings until your mind started fabricating images and sounds. The first time they went was mid-day, Kayla jumped in through a shattered window on the base level, not surprisingly their first exploration only lasted about five minutes. Not too long after, their curiosity dragged them back.  Their visits got longer, they started exploring more rooms in several different buildings on the grounds.  A few months later they heard word that their favorite spot, like many others, was soon to be demolished. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431825180/bhb7ktukupgsbirwlhu2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This information lead them to start searching for other locations with similar histories. Since then they have been on a mission to try to capture the beauty and unique history of these old buildings, before they are gone forever. </p>
<p><b>Vacant</b>, the documentary, is tying together the work of Casey, a film major at the School of Visual Arts in NYC, with her and Kayla's love of exploration. This film is not only informative, but also raw. Capturing the real emotions and fear of two girls experiencing the dark corridors of buildings that have been closed off to the public for decades.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Casey and Kayla's goal is to preserve a large part of the history of small New England towns. Many of these buildings were opened in the early 1800s or 1900s and served a substantial role in their communities. Most older generations lived during the facilities hay-days, some even heard legends about the atrocities committed within the buildings walls. The younger generation has never seen these buildings in working condition, thus leaving them to assume they are old and have no sentiment or interesting history...only a place to break into and destroy.</p>
<p>Casey and Kayla set out to sort fact from fiction, answer all the age old questions and deliver you the entire story from the very construction of the building, up until its current state. </p>

</div></div>","Vacant: a documentary
 Casey S and Kayla D grew up in a tight knit, rural part of Rhode Island. Around the age of 14 they started exploring The Dr. Joseph H. Ladd Center, locally known as The Ladd School. 


It was almost a right of passage to sneak onto the property with a small flash light, and wander around the old buildings until your mind started fabricating images and sounds. The first time they went was mid-day, Kayla jumped in through a shattered window on the base level, not surprisingly their first exploration only lasted about five minutes. Not too long after, their curiosity dragged them back.  Their visits got longer, they started exploring more rooms in several different buildings on the grounds.  A few months later they heard word that their favorite spot, like many others, was soon to be demolished. 


This information lead them to start searching for other locations with similar histories. Since then they have been on a mission to try to capture the beauty and unique history of these old buildings, before they are gone forever. 
Vacant, the documentary, is tying together the work of Casey, a film major at the School of Visual Arts in NYC, with her and Kayla's love of exploration. This film is not only informative, but also raw. Capturing the real emotions and fear of two girls experiencing the dark corridors of buildings that have been closed off to the public for decades.
Funding Vacant will help with the cost of supplies, travel, production and public fees.  Donations will help us expose our viewers to as much as possible, for example, maps and local records.

<p>Artists, Musicians, Promoters and Fans from all around the World are welcome to join us, however, many of our fans come from third World Countries and can't afford a flight to join us. </p>
<p>This campaign aims to make a short film (minimum 7 mins) in order to keep the World Citizen Artists community connected. </p>
<p>Initially, we had engaged a well known film director, with over 20 years experience for BBC, PBS, ARTE, etc. who was willing to volunteer for free to do the camera work for the event. Unfortunately, he's had to cancel for urgent professional matters.</p>
<p>Since World Citizen Artists is only one year old, the non profit organisation can't afford a professional with such skills.</p>
<p>World Citizen Artists believes that together, we can make this film for our fans and for artists who will come all the way to Paris from Brazil, Canada, Haiti, Ireland and Argentina to perform.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Summary 
World Citizen Artists (WCA) first year attracted artists, musicians and fans from all continents, backgrounds, styles, ages, political views, religious beliefs, levels of wealth and poverty, etc…
Despite our differences, we all share the same world and our WCA team and members have been working actively to reunite those who believe that together, we can create positive change in the World.

On 20th June 2014 (World Refugee Day) WCA created its website and Facebook page in order to Raise Awareness through Creativity. Artists contributed their ‘Voices‘ to issues covered by the United Nations World Days.
Within the first three months, WCA reached over 10 000 fans.
On 21st September 2014 (International Day of Peace), WCA launched its first Worldwide Competition on the theme of Peace, in partnership with Playing For Change Foundation (worldwide music foundation, operated in association with world-class musicians and producers, which assists children to learn music.) Belgravia Gallery (named Gallery of the Year 2013. One of Europe’s leading art galleries, it regularly features the work of renowned artists and celebrities such as: Picasso, Andy Warhol, Matisse, HRH The Prince of Wales, Nelson Mandela, Sir Peter Blake and others) and Issuu (one of the world’s leading digital publishing platforms, which gives publishers tools to deliver over 5 billion page views each month to more than 80 million readers.)

WCA Competition Slogan: “Compete for Peace – Not War”
This competition has been a key opportunity for emerging and established artists to exhibit their work in the prestigious Belgravia Gallery, Mayfair, London, and for musicians to have their name featured by the renowned Playing for Change Foundation on their website and social media channels.
Yosvany Terry, the famous Cuban saxophonist/percussionist/composer and Grammy Award Nominee 2015 joined the WCA jury and Nomfusi (the South African celebrity singer and actress portrayed the character of Miriam Makeba in the Golden Globe winning film about Mandela “Long Walk To Freedom” with appearances at both the Hollywood and Berlin premieres) announced the results on 5th December 2014.

issuu gave free premium memberships to the winners and finalists and the first WCA Art, the music winners were featured on Playing For Change Foundation and the visual artists winners saw their one month exhibition taking place at the Belgravia Gallery on 11th December 2014.

On 21st June 2015 (World Music Day), WCA will celebrate its first Anniversary in partnership with International Day of Peace (Established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1981 “Peace Day” is an opportunity for individuals, organizations and nations to create practical acts of peace on a shared date. Pathways To Peace, working with members of the UN, helped obtain historic levels of support for Peace Day. In 1984, PTP held the first major International Day of Peace celebration in San Francisco with major events including the Minute of Silence Moment of Peace, when business cash registers stopped, a TV station was silent, and global Peace Wave bringing the Day to everyone, everywhere. Media called it – A silence heard around the world) and the prestigious Bataclan Café (attached to the famous venue ‘The Bataclan‘ known for leading-edge concerts and gigs. The adjacent cafe, modelled on a Chinese Theatre, is known as a hangout for musicians and fans. Musicians who play there include Alpha Blondy, Paul Weller and Jimmy Cliff, etc) and Playing For Change Foundation.

The World Citizen Artists First Anniversary will be celebrated on World Music Day .
This event is also supported by Radio France Internationale (RFI) who will provide the publicity of the event on their social media channels.  RFI generally referred to by its acronym RFI, is a French public radio service that broadcasts in Paris and all over the world. With 35.6 million listeners in 2008, it is one of the most listened to international radio stations in the world, along with BBC World Service, Voice of America and Deutsche Welle. 
The event will take place on 21 June 2015 at the Bataclan Café – 50 Boulevard Voltaire – 75011 Paris – Metro Oberkampf
WCA Musicians will start performing @ 7pm and BélO will be receiving his Award during the event. All the musicians have financed their own flight and accomodation with their own savings, in order to make a difference in the World and show that with solidarity, great things happen! 

Artists, Musicians, Promoters and Fans from all around the World are welcome to join us, however, many of our fans come from third World Countries and can't afford a flight to join us. 
This campaign aims to make a short film (minimum 7 mins) in order to keep the World Citizen Artists community connected. 
Initially, we had engaged a well known film director, with over 20 years experience for BBC, PBS, ARTE, etc. who was willing to volunteer for free to do the camera work for the event. Unfortunately, he's had to cancel for urgent professional matters.
Since World Citizen Artists is only one year old, the non profit organisation can't afford a professional with such skills.
World Citizen Artists believes that together, we can make this film for our fans and for artists who will come all the way to Paris from Brazil, Canada, Haiti, Ireland and Argentina to perform.

What We Need & What You Get The film director we have chosen has agreed to edit and pre-direct the film, which will reduce the cost of hiring professionals. So we need a:



Cameraman (U$ 1000)

Videographer (U$ 500) 

Break it down for folks in more detail:  Were budgeting $1000 for the professional camera person, to include time, equipment.  In addition, we're budgeting $500 for a videographer, again including time and equipment and an overnight in Paris. The best perks for getting involved are the opportunity to associate with a rapidly growing arts and music humanitarian organisation, the chance to meet the musicians on the evening of the event, and a copy of the recorded music after the event. If we don't raise sufficient funds for the filming, we will use the money towards publicity for the event and to help the musicians hire equipment they need.    The Impact  Your contribution will make a huge impact towards the success of this event, and in turn assist its impact more widely out there in the arts and humanitarian worlds:  The project is valuable because it connects passionate and engaged artists and musicians with humanitarian causes. We have an established track record dealing with demanding partners, and high-profile events. We've engaged serious partners for this event. To learn more about what world system artists stands for  and the ethics that underpin our organisation, simply visit our website at www.worldcitizenartists.org
    Risks & Challenges
We know it won't be easy to raise this amount of money  in such a short period of time, but with your engagement and passion we will get there!   Other Ways You Can Help It's just possible that you can help us directly!   If you know how to use a video camera to a reasonable level, and own  one and can be in Paris on the evening of 21 June, we would be delighted to discuss with you the possibility of you filming the event for us.",0.0,5,"1 Campaign

<b>
<div><br/></div></b><p></p>
<p><b>Harvest Moon is a suspense/thriller</b> set among the landscape of small town America. It's focused around the love of two young people who end up in the middle of a small town blood bath, and asks the question. How far will you go to bring back what you've lost?</p>
<p>This will be shot in the vein of ""<b>No Country for Old Men</b>"" with a hitchcock feel. Bringing suspense and terror out of the depths of the viewer's mind. </p>
<p><b>We are shooting and delivering in 4K</b> using <b>all practical stunts and effects</b>. We strive for realism and that's what we get. </p>
<p>This isn't another hack and slash teen horror, this will be a <b>suspenseful masterpiece </b>and we want you to be a part of it.  </p>
<p>Indiegogo is vital to the production of this film. Not only will it bring us closer to our full production costs but it will also allow us to connect with our fanbase and spread the word about Harvest Moon even further. There is an intrinsic value with creating a close relationship to people who really enjoy these types of film and the Harvest Moon Team thanks Indiegogo for helping grow those bonds. </p>
<p><b><br/><b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>Our Team</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our team is a mixture of superb visual artists, special effects masters, and skilled leaders who have worked on everything from ""<b>Castle to August: Osage County"".</b> We work as a community to create beautiful and entertaining works of art that appeal to a wide audience and offer a great experience. We have <b>over 50 years of combined film and TV experience</b> as well as some of the top mentors in the industry. </p>
<p>We <b>fully support the local workforce</b>, so to fill out the rest of our team we're hiring <b>local Oklahomans</b> who have been underutilized in the film industry. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>What We Have</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Our list </b>keeps getting <b>bigger and bigger</b>. We have an <b>awesome script</b>, and an <b>amazing director and DP</b>. We've been able to lock down almost 95% of our locations in and around Enid OK. That includes an old city jail, a 100 year plus church, and of course the grain elevator. </p>
<p>We have awesome production equipment, shooting on the <b>RED Epic</b> using <b>DJI Ronin Gimbals, helicopter drones, cranes, jibs,</b> and many more. </p>
<p>We have an awesome list of <b>local Oklahoma</b> production people with many years of experience. </p>
<p>We have the massive support of the Enid community as well as the<b> Oklahoma Film Commission</b>. </p>
<p>Most importantly we have the never <b>stopping drive to succeed</b>. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>What We Need</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>You!</b> And your ability to spread the word about the film. Once you become part of the Harvest Moon Team tell others to do the same. Before long we'll all be sitting in the theater eating popcorn and gripping our neighbor tight as the suspense builds. <b>Best of all you'll know you made it happen. </b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>Where the Money Goes</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Every cent of this money will go directly into the production. </p>
<p>We have food costs, housing costs, crew payments, grip and lighting rentals, prop design, set design, advertising... The list keeps going. Long story short, it takes money to make a movie, but it takes a bigger chunk of money to make it amazing. With all the locations and favors, we're getting a good <b>$750,000 worth of extra production value that goes directly into the film. </b></p>
<p>When you add all that up, <b>the value far exceeds the costs </b>to make this amazing movie. </p>
<p>We have a good chunk of our budget already secured, but it's not quite enough to bring this amazing film to the big screen. </p>
<p>We're going to be pushing this campaign past its benchmark and when we <b>double our goal</b> the bells will ring as sad children all over the world begin to play again. We'll be able to secure <b>theatrical distribution</b> <b>(already in talking with 3 distribution companies)</b> and will be holding <b>massive block parties</b> all over the US. Of course you're invited. </p>
<p>Get ready to see some <b>awesome stunts</b> and <b>big name talent</b> jump in that we're in negotiations with. <b>(trust me, this is more than worth it especially if you're one of the lucy people to come to set) </b> </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>As with any film there will be unforeseen challenges and obstacles to overcome, but I assure you that we will never stop until we have our finished film in all it's glory. </p>
<p><b>This is what we do, this is our love, and this is what we're great at. </b></p>
<p>The only part that's left is getting the word out and <b>funding this project!</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>It's super easy to share this with your friends with the links right next to the opening video. </b></p>

Noget som sjældent ses på dansk. Vores formål er at tage elementerne fra de bedste amerikanske ungdomsgysere og bygge en dansk film op efter samme principper. Det betyder mindre socialrealisme, og flere eventyrlige, underholdende og fede elementer. </p><p>Vores hovedperson, Jimmy, er en outsider i sin gymnasieklasse med hang til gys og alt okkult. Han socialiserer ikke meget, men forsøger i stedet at kontakte sin afdøde mor gennem ældgamle ritualer. Kontakten med de døde bliver kun til vage fornemmelser, indtil den nye dreng i klassen, Amir overtaler ham til at imponere de populære piger Louise og Anna med en hemmelig seance. Pludselig er Jimmys ånder blevet en virkelig trussel, og derfor må han overtale Louise, Anna og Amir til at hjælpe. For at stoppe det onde må Jimmy lære at få kontakt til de levende.</p>

Vi er Sohail A. Hassan og Jannick Raunow og sammen vil vi lave denne spillefilm. Sohail har mere end 20 års erfaring med at lave film i kortere formater og føler at nu er tiden moden til at opgradere til spillefilm. Derfor opsøgte han en producer, der deler hans passion for genrefilm. Og det er hvad Jannick leverer: Evnen til at koordinere, samle og holde styr på alle trådene, mens Sohail fokuserer på at lave en fantastisk film.<p></p>

En spillefilm. Skræk, spænding, ånder og monstre. Noget som sjældent ses på dansk. Vores formål er at tage elementerne fra de bedste amerikanske ungdomsgysere og bygge en dansk film op efter samme principper. Det betyder mindre socialrealisme, og flere eventyrlige, underholdende og fede elementer. Vores hovedperson, Jimmy, er en outsider i sin gymnasieklasse med hang til gys og alt okkult. Han socialiserer ikke meget, men forsøger i stedet at kontakte sin afdøde mor gennem ældgamle ritualer. Kontakten med de døde bliver kun til vage fornemmelser, indtil den nye dreng i klassen, Amir overtaler ham til at imponere de populære piger Louise og Anna med en hemmelig seance. Pludselig er Jimmys ånder blevet en virkelig trussel, og derfor må han overtale Louise, Anna og Amir til at hjælpe. For at stoppe det onde må Jimmy lære at få kontakt til de levende.


Vi er Sohail A. Hassan og Jannick Raunow og sammen vil vi lave denne spillefilm. Sohail har mere end 20 års erfaring med at lave film i kortere formater og føler at nu er tiden moden til at opgradere til spillefilm. Derfor opsøgte han en producer, der deler hans passion for genrefilm. Og det er hvad Jannick leverer: Evnen til at koordinere, samle og holde styr på alle trådene, mens Sohail fokuserer på at lave en fantastisk film.
Vi vil gerne have din hjælp. Kun på den måde kan filmen nemlig blive endnu bedre end det vi kan præstere alene. Med din deltagelse kan vi hæve det overordnede “look” af filmen, så alting bare ser meget bedre ud.

   



Med hundredevis af videoproduktioner bag sig, heriblandt prisvindende kortfilm fra CPH PIX, har Sohail i 20 år arbejdet med film. Bl.a. ved Zentropa og som én af stifterne bag filmskolen Station Next i Valby.


DU skal være en del af Lad De Døde HvileFilmen er undervejs, og vi har absolut planer om at gøre den fantastisk. Men, effekter er dyre og der er andre udgifter der skal dækkes. Det betyder at din deltagelse vil gøre forskellen mellem en simpelt produceret film og en lækker film med Hollywood-look og effekter, så gyset bliver rigtig effektivt.Lad De Døde Hvile er en fandependant produktion. Det betyder at vi laver filmen til fans af genrefilm. Er du til gys og underholdning, så vil det være en film for dig. En del af målet med kampagnen er at opbygge en fanbase, så vi kan gå til filmdistributører og vise hvor populært projektet er.Om vi når vores mål eller ej, er ikke afgørende for filmens tilblivelse. Det er udelukkende en faktor for, hvor fantastisk vi kan få det færdige produkt til at se ud. Så kig på listen over vores Perks til højre og se om der er noget for dig!Hvorfor lade de døde hvile?Efter vores mening er der for lidt rigtige genrefilm i dansk film. Der er for meget socialrealisme, og for lidt magi og gys. Selv varulvefilm bliver mere socialrealistiske end rigtige genrefilm. Derfor vil vi lave en film, hvor virkemidlerne er i fokus. Det betyder ikke at historien skal være rodet, eller at figurerne ikke har dybde, men at fokus er på gys, magi og gru.Som det kan ses på vores billeder, har vi allerede fundet et fantastisk cast af unge skuespillere, såvel som et hold af talentfulde mennesker til bl.a. rekvisitter, special effects og makeup. Manuskriptet gennemgår de sidste finredigeringer, pre-produktionen er i fuld sving og der bygges rekvisitter og effekter til den helt store guldmedalje. 


Udfordringer og løsninger


Som ved ethvert spillefilmsprojekt, er der mange ting, der kan gå galt. Men vi har allerede et ekstremt stærkt hold og er vi stærkt hjulpet af at have Sohail ved roret, som med sine 20 års erfaring med at lave film, kender alt til, hvad der kan opstå undervejs, og har både evner og erfaring til at fixe selv det mest umulige.Hvad vigtigst er, er at vi brænder for projektet og ikke har tænkt os at lade noget som helst stå i vejen for at filmen bliver lavet. Og med din hjælp har vi endnu mere overskud til at den bliver så fed som overhovedet muligt!

   



Uddannet både civiløkonom og skuespiller, har Jannick haft drevet og produceret kortfilm, teaterforestillinger, performanceevents, forumteatervirksomhed og konsulentvirksomhed i årevis.

""High Treason at the Highest Level""




“Senior General Staff are directly involved in a Cover-up.”




""We Were Betrayed""







“The
Congress and the military
need


to lift the curtain of deceit.


This MUST be made into a film.”



On August 6, 2011, Taliban forces shot down a United States
helicopter, call sign, “Extortion 17.” The attack killed eight mysterious Afghans and the following US Special forces:
                            15 - Navy Special Warfare Development Group (DevGru)                               2 - Navy West Coast
SEALs                               5 - Top-tier Navy Servicemen (DevGru Support)                              3 - Top-tier USAF Personnel (DevGru Support)                               1 - Navy SEAL combat service dog (DevGru Support)
The SEAL Team Six fallen warriors were all
from the same team that had killed Osama Bin Laden just 90 days before the
shoot-down. Extortion 17 was the largest loss of life for
America in the Afghan war and the largest loss of life in the history of Naval
Special Warfare.

                                   

(Actual crash site - Extortion 17)
Fallen Angel, our
investigative documentary, re-creates the wartime action, tells the stories of
the heroic warriors our nation lost on that day and tears apart the official
military explanation of the incident contained in the infamous Colt Report,
a SECRET document produced by the Department of Defense, which reveals either gross incompetence
or a massive cover-up. 
Fallen Angel
focuses on a series of key factors pointing to a massive government cover-up and/or gross negligence, including:


A rush-to-completion 30 day investigation
An inexplicable disappearance of the flight data recorder (black box)
Critical autopsy evidence excluded from final report listing bullets found in the bodies of SEALs 

Critical evidence arbitrarily destroyed (bullets found in bodies) and thrown away by government

A failure to address US State Department reports and warnings of massive Taliban infiltration (at least 50%) in the
Afghan military
A failure to address the Taliban’s vengeful campaign of targeting SEAL Team Six
after the US government revealed that DevGru was
responsible for killing Osama Bin Laden
Rushing eight un-vetted and unidentified Afghans on board in the last minutes with SEAL Team Six
A flight manifest that has gone missing, lost, or has been destroyed 


The government's “Lucky Shot” theory that a flying helicopter was hit by a RPG from 3 1/2 football fields away in total complete darkness with no night visioning
equipment


Begin with us an unbelievable
journey that takes you deeply into the fight against Islamic
jihad by way of the operational activity of the U.S. Navy's Special Warfare Development Group (DevGru) - SEAL Team Six.
Through our investigative movie, you will be confronted with forensic evidence
that will illustrate a series of lies, a pattern of deception, and a blatant cover-up surrounding the single one day largest loss
of life in U.S. Naval Special Warfare - a journey which may uncover a


US Helicopter Shot Down in Taliban Trap

as reported by the Agence France-Presse (AFP), the third largest
international press agency (after AP and Reuters).
                                                         

""A total of 38 people --
25 US special forces members, five US crew members, seven Afghan commandos plus
an interpreter - were killed when their Chinook came down during an
anti-Taliban operation late Friday.""
""a
well respected senior Afghan government official told AFP on condition of
anonymity that Taliban commander Qari Tahir (a.k.a. Lefty Grove) lured US forces to the scene by
tipping them off  that a Taliban meeting was taking place. He also said four
Pakistanis helped Tahir carry out the strike,"" said the official, citing intelligence gathered from the area.


""Now it's confirmed that the
helicopter was shot down and it was a trap that was set by a Taliban
commander."" 


""The Taliban knew which route the
helicopter would take,"" he continued. 
""That's the only route, so they took
position on the either side of the valley on mountains and as the helicopter
approached, they attacked it with rockets and other modern weapons. It was
brought down by multiple shots,"" said the senior Afghan government official.  (See full AFP Story here)


For Investigation Details: FallenAngelTheMovie.org

Who ordered the crash investigation rush-to-completion in 30 days and why?
Why was a one Star General, untrained and unqualified in Crash Investigation with no CSI experience, selected as Lead Crash Investigator?
Who were the eight
mysterious Afghan Nationals on board Extortion 17? 
Who vetted the mysterious Afghans and how was it performed?

Why were Afghan forces sympathetic to the Taliban embedded with SEAL Team Six? 

Were the eight unidentified
     Afghans supplying information to the Taliban and/or al-Qaeda? 

Only three
autopsy reports have been obtained. Where are the dog's and the 35 other autopsy reports?
Why were
all autopsy reports excluded from the Colt Report?
How did bullets 
get into the bodies of two SEALs wearing Kevlar vests?
Why were these bullets, critical evidence, thrown away?
Where is the flight data recorder (Black Box)?
Where are the videos of the three gunships flying overhead?
Why was the AC-130 gunship and an AH-64 Apache gunship denied permission to fire?

Why was this mission even flown in the first place?

Why was SEAL Team Six flown into ""combat zone"" in
a loud and slow Vietnam era ""transport helicopter?""
Why did Extortion 16 (the sister ship) fly empty and only half of the mission?
Are the Rules of Engagement primarily responsible for this disaster?



The documentary ""Fallen Angel: Cover-up of SEAL Team Six Shoot-down"" is an adaptation of Don Brown's non-fiction investigative book, ""Call Sign Extortion 17: The Shoot-Down of SEAL Team Six.""
Don Brown is a former U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General (JAG) Officer, stationed at
the Pentagon, and an author of ten published novels and is perhaps best known
for his bestselling novel, Treason. Brown studied at the U.S.
Naval War College earning the Navy's nonresident
certificate in International Law. 
As an JAG action officer at the Pentagon in 1992,
Brown drafted legal memoranda for the Secretary of the Navy. He was published
in the US Navy Law Review, drafting a law review article instructing United
States Military Lawyers on defending against temporary injunctions filed
against the military. Serving as a U.S. Navy JAG officer, Brown was
appointed Special Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of
California. 

Dan Gordon is a reserve officer with the Israel Defense Forces and an
accomplished Hollywood Screenwriter/Director. He will be a special consultant
on Fallen Angel assisting with writing, production, distribution and marketing.

 Our Investigation Will Expose

 
Our investigative movie,
“Fallen Angel” will present a comprehensive evidentiary case that
exposes the U.S. Government's unprofessional and improper investigation on
significant elements including but not limited to the following:


The government's gross failure and implementation of the Rules of Engagement 



The
government’s crash investigation violated the National Transportation Safety
Board's (NTSB) minimal and basic investigative requirements



There was no proper investigation into the deaths of America's finest
warriors and a
independent federal investigation must be conducted




The governments failure to provide special forces with the best equipment available



A possible criminal
cover-up to hide a well planned coordinated attack by the Taliban for blood-money
revenge on SEAL Team Six in retribution for killing Osama Bin Laden, the
world’s most wanted terrorist, on May 1, 2011, ninety seven days before the
shoot-down of Extortion 17 on August 6, 2011




A possible improper
handling, cremation, disposal and internment of US Servicemen
and Afghan Nationals



The government's foolish, reckless, and routine practice of embedding Green Afghan forces with special forces units


A failure to provide special forces with the best equipment available


A gross violation of security in
providing green forces Top Secret intelligence on US troop movements and
special forces operations 




A possible gross dereliction of duty
     by many senior military leaders in the planning and operation of this mission






The government's criminal
destruction of crime scene evidence regarding bullets found in the bodies
of two SEALs






Numerous Gross violations of the UCMJ (Uniform Code of Military Justice) by Senior military officers 



A possible gross
Dereliction of Duty in times of war by allowing questionable
Afghan Nationals to board an aircraft with a highly
targeted special forces unit - SEAL Team Six

To fully expose a government cover-up of the
     single largest loss of life in Naval Special Warfare history.  

To initiate a congressional investigation by a special

     to hold those responsible for their deaths.

To change the Rules of Engagement for which are
     unnecessarily putting American troops in grave danger when they are engaged
     in combat operations.














Minimally, the producers of Fallen Angel want the absurd
Rules of Engagement changed so that our war fighters can fight wars, to win. Our documentary will call for a proper and professional Congressional
Investigation: 


To initiate a full congressional investigation
headed by an independent special federal prosecutor in order to investigate the
deaths of 30 US Service members and to hold those responsible for this tragedy. 


To fully expose a government cover-up behind the shoot-down of the
single largest loss of life in Special Forces history. 


To bring about major policy changes in
the military for our fighting forces to include but not limited to:





Change the Rules of Engagement (ROE) – The current rules of engagement state, “units
engaged in firefights must first be fired upon and cannot call in air strikes
to protect their positions unless they can convince commanders that no
civilians will be harmed.”


Rewrite current ROE
to protect US Soldiers to allow them pre-support fire when enemy combatants are
present 

To fire first when enemy combatants are identified. 

Define civilians as those not harboring, nor giving protection, nor military aid to the enemy force.
No sanctuary provided in places of worship when used to hide military personnel and weapons.  

 



Change current Green on Blue policies &
procedures. Note: In Military terms
Green [neutral force], Blue [friendly force], Yellow [unknown force], Red
[enemy force]:

The
US military states that one out of four (25%) of Afghan Army personnel (Green
Forces) are enemy infiltrators and sympathetic to the Taliban. The US
Ambassador to Afghanistan states that the Army has underestimated drastically,
and it is much higher than 25%.
No US Forces are to be embedded with Green forces in
combat situations. 

No US Forces shall be required to brief Green Forces
on operational, Top Secret or classified information concerning combat
operations – especially those of Special Forces
units. 

Green forces shall not be given the authority to cancel or
veto any US mission at any time they desire. 

Green Forces shall not be embedded with any military units
(combat and non-combat) until fully vetted and given security clearance by
investigators. 


Current military procedures and tactics call for Special Forces and
combat units to be flown into live fire combat situations in slow moving
Vietnam era transport helicopters and require Special Forces and combat units
to be embedded with Green Forces on many missions. 



Combat soldiers must not be flown into live fire
combat situations in non-combat aircraft. 



Special forces units must be assigned the latest
technological combat aircraft for combat missions. 

Special Forces personal shall not be required to
share planning, operational procedures, or tactics with neutral Green
forces. 


All US
Military aircraft will be required
to have installed a Flight Data Recorder (Black Box) in the event of a
disaster. Those aircraft without Flight Data Recorders shall be immediately
grounded. 

Combat units must have combat trained pilots flying aircraft
designed for combat.

Transport aircraft may be used to transport military
personnel to non-combat areas. 

Special Warfare Development Group (DevGru) must be
assigned the best specially trained combat pilots and permanently assigned the
military’s latest and greatest helicopters and combat aircraft.

Special Forces units must have specially trained
combat pilots trained to fly with Special Forces. Specially trained combat
pilots must be assigned to fly Special Forces units for combat and non-combat
missions in combat zones.

</div>","Short SummaryMy name is Braden Smith. I am a Veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and a student at The Los Angeles Film School.  My campaign is to fund a short film called ""The Other Side"". The story follows a distraught combat Veteran in search for a cure to clear the thoughts of his past. The passion to create this film stems from many of my friends who have been in similar situations. This film will bring you on a psychological journey you will never forget. 
If we were able to reach the goal of $4,000, it would allow me to fund the location for the shoot.  This is crucial for the story, I want to use a practical location that best fits our main character. This not only makes the film more believable but it also sets it aside from most student thesis films.  
All of the $4,000 would go towards the shooting location, which is an authentic secluded desert house. Some of the funds will also be put towards our state of the art camera package.  It will provide us with two days of shooting at the location, which is perfect for the story we want to tell. 
If you aren't able to contribute but are willing to help, please spread the word! Thank you for your time. 
Our leading actor is the very talented Joe Coffey!Check out his work below.

I recently wrote &amp; premiered my first short film ""Valley of The Sun"" with the help of Tony Kure &amp; a gang of talented actors &amp; actresses here in Phoenix, AZ. </p>

<p>March 2015 I found myself in Tucson with my team recording some new songs for my project. As I was brainstorming which direction to go I decided instead of going the traditional route with a bunch of music videos, why not turn these songs into a MOVIE??? I wanted to give a <b>FULL</b> experience this time and not hold  anything back! So I turned to the best director I know, Tony Kure, we put our minds together and designed a draft for the script. Next thing you know, we had a teaser trailer for Valley of the Sun, a small cast, crew, and half of the film done by July- but this was only the beginning. The film did so great we <b>sold out</b> the premiere at Arizona Mills Harkins Theater &amp; <b>now</b> have decided to bring the film to my hometown, <b>Cedar Rapids, IA</b>!!! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>The reason why I decided to go the Indiegogo route this time is because I would like to take a percentage of the proceeds from this project as well as ticket sales from the premiere &amp; donate to the Boys &amp; Girls club of Cedar Rapids. The Boys &amp; Girls club was one of the places which kept me focused and out of the streets. My wish is to do the same with this donation to help the Boy's and Girl's Club for kids in the community.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> To be honest, looking forward, we have challenges ahead and no doubt they are tough, However, I believe we will be able to excel and achieve not just this goal but our stretch goal set for the film. We now have less than <b>30 days </b>to accomplish this goal as well as complete the sound for the film. 7 Months ago this started as an <i>idea</i> and grew into a sold out premiere. Many nights we have sacrificed sleep, money, savings, even the clothes on our backs to bring this vision into a reality. I am blessed to be in this position to bring a film to the big screen, the ultimate goal is to bring it to my hometown, and here I am which is a dream come true.</p>

<p>--From the Executive Producer, Joseph James--</p>
<p>My name is Joseph James, I've been in freemasonry for about 10 years. I'm a Master Mason and a 32nd Degree Freemason in the Scottish Rite. I have also been initiated into the Shriners Organization and I am a member of the York Rite (Knights Templar) and a life member of Gul Reazee Grotto. </p>
<p>Ever since my initiation into Freemasonry I have consistently learned a lot from the men and women who are involved with the various organizations. As Freemasonry continues to grow, it has been an honor to associate myself with people of all ages, backgrounds and countries who are all a part of the worldwide Masonic organization. I've also personally seen the positive effects that the Masonic charities have on the world. I also find it exciting to learn about the symbolism and the influence Freemasonry has on both past and current events.</p>

For the past few years, my team & I have been doing a lot of research to find sites where shipwrecks have been long forgotten.   Recently you may have heard in the news about divers who recovered 350 gold coins off the coast of Florida worth $4.5 million.  My team & I have located more treasure that is awaiting and we want to document our journey.  Watch us every step of the way as we uncover history from the depths of the ocean.  Meet Our Team!Richard VanoverMr. Vanover, is a businessman and successfully ran an encyclopedia company for 12 years. He currently runs a successful paint contracting business.

Mr. Vanover staff and crew conducted salvage operations on the 1715 Plate Fleet under contract with Mel Fisher’s Salver’s Inc. He also completed a search and salvage contract with Salver’s Inc. to salvage emeralds on the Atocha shipwreck, part of a Spanish treasure fleet lost in 1622.Mr. Vanover and his crew recovered approximately $1,068,000 in emeralds during the 1994 season. In 1995, Mr. Vanover completed two exploratory trips to the Republic of Haiti, where he has located three shipwrecks, and is negotiating with the Haitian government for a lease contract to salvage ancient shipwrecks in the Republic of Haiti.Technical Support on Equipment, Researcher and Adviser -Greg HawleyMr. Hawley, is an avid treasure hunter and scuba diver with over 20 years of diving experience.

<p>I’ve trained dogs my

<p>The woman who started
All Herding Breed Dog Rescue, Robin Carberry, is a good friend. I met her when
she was judging an agility dog show in Western New York. We became friends
right off the bat. When she found out I was going to school in Missouri she
invited me to her home in Illinois for a party and offered to house me for a
night or two whenever I needed to break from school as well as on my way home
to New York.</p>
<p>I ended up fostering a dog from the rescue. His name was Spotley. He was by far the most
emotionally damaged dog that I’ve ever worked with. He was terrified of people
and lived under my bed for three weeks before I was able to coax him out. He
was so much work, but the bond that formed between us over the three months that
he was in my care was amazing. I cried when I left at him at his new home.
After that experience, I contacted Robin about making a documentary about them
and they were more than excited to help in any way that they could! </p>

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Hello everyone, My name is Montetré.  I am a filmmaker <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3761418/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3761418/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3761418/#director"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(credentials) </a>with six movies under my belt.  My newest romp in film was/is Zombie Cats from Mars.  I am making a new feature film that is a whole lot of fun, a whole lot of work and a whole lot of prep.  The film is to be completed while using only one continuous shot.  The movie is called Marty in Transit.  In this one, long take (to be anywhere from 85-110 Minutes, dependent on traffic), the audience will go on an adventure with Marty (the undercover FBI Agent), even go as far as experiencing his past moments, zipping from the real world to his memories with fluid motion.  This is based off of a 96 page script and it is being rehearsed with the full cast beginning July 7th, 2015.  A lot of us are already rehearsing together, to be prepared and off-book, since we shoot our rehearsal on Monday, July 13th.  That was actually a roaring success (tons of mishaps, but such a good rehearsal).  All actors and actresses have been cast, the crew has been found, equipment/camera necessary. We are merely missing the funds to make it happen.</span></div>

Old wounds reopen in this place of lost love and hate, creeping up on him as faces of the past reemerge, always knowing that the killer is out there.  He or she could be one of many people, including Mob Boss and RadioCab Owner George Lively (Marty's old boss), or it could be the new, ridiculous and mysterious hitman Knick, or maybe it's the elusive femme fatale....Veronica.  The list of suspects gets smaller as the day wears on.  One thing is certain, Marty wants his life to go back to normal.  He wants out of this town.  The only way to do that, is to track and snare The Cabby Killer.</span></div>

<div>My last feature film had a turnaround time of 6 months, from conception to release.  It was called Zombie Cats from Mars.  You may have heard of it.  With that film, we desired to make fun of schlocky movies from the 50's.  Above is the DVD Cover Art.</div>
<div></div>
<div>With <i>Marty in Transit </i>the film is about love lost, killers on the run and self-discovery.  It's also hilarious and bad-ass. <i> Marty</i> will be entirely in color, but the sound design is something quite ingenious, as it involves the main character's wire tap (the FBI Agent wears a wire), so wherever that wire goes, that is what the audience hears.  It gets kind of trippy, as sometimes the camera will be away from the wire, watching another character as we can still hear the main character with their wire.  That isn't to say that there is only one microphone being used in the film, but actually a great glob of them (8, to be precise, all brought precisely throughout the city of Portland with the actors and camera crew, in some instances set-up in advance). </div>
<div><b><i>Here is a map of our actual expenditure on that we performed on July 13th.  Things got crazy in the downtown region, so we have decided to shoot the actual film in the Eastside of Portland, where there is much less traffic, but, it'll have a lot of twists and turns similar to our original route below:</i></b></div>

<p>I did not go to film school.  Everything that I have learned has been through doing.  The long take is something that I believe will help strengthen/inspire independent filmmakers like myself. I can and will make a feature film on a very low budget with your support.  Here is why:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">1. = It's only one day of work/filming.  We have technical meetings with the crew twice a week (one in person, one through conference call).  We have 3 rehearsals with the entire cast and crew coming up (below is an exterior picture of our rehearsal space for three days, an old furniture warehouse being run by Multicultural organization Jade/APANO.  The pictures after that is the inside (what it looks like now).  That entire room is ours to use!  It's huge!!!: </span><br/>

<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">......On July 13th, we actually did a complete run-through in the city, with all of the crew and actors (following the map above by memory).  This was very important to us as it helped enable everyone to know exactly where to stand. We also will have a few drive-arounds in our new region (that is, driving the new route in the Eastside with the crew before the run-through), before finally filming with the camera-ready cast.  Once again, we began rehearsals on July 7th.  We plan to shoot it Late August.  Check out our 5th update to see a great example of what our rehearsals accomplish!</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">2. = </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Money, I know how to save it on and off set.  The fact is that you don't need a great amount of money to make a movie </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">if</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> that small budget suits the film in question.  With my Marty in Transit, I'd like to shoot at a budget of $2,500 a day and like I said, for only one day.  Most films (even the indies), can cost much more during filming (even without A-List Actors, as these films tend to have a comparably gigantic -and I am sure a very talented - lot of crew members), but if the film were to be shot at 2.5k a day for 20 days (a normal filming timeframe), you'd end up with a film that cost $50,000.  And we aren't even talking post-production costs (for us, there are NO Post-Production costs, as I will be editing the sound design and doing the Black and White Color Correction; simply promotional costs are what Post-Production holds for us).  Marty in Transit will cost a grand total of $3,500 to make (including production/color-correcting/promotion), all because we're making a high-end movie with only one day of filming. </span>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">3. = Time, I know how to use it.  My standard is this, really: I want to make a movie.  So, you know, I'm already inspired, the script's written, blah, blah, blah, but now...  I'm in the position to find a cast and a crew.  I have to be on a major hunt for people willing to commit.  These people are REAL PEOPLE, they have real lives and I must work around them.  Inevitably, I still want to make this movie.  So, without compromising artistic integrity, ""Ha, artistic integrity coming from the guy who made Zombie Cats from Mars,"" like I was saying, I must be willing to work around people's lives.  These people want to be in this movie, they have these, ""Obligations,"" but in the end, if I'm honest and good at hearing them out, we can make a movie together.  Basically, to successfully shoot a movie it's all scheduling (as long as you have the money).  </span></li>

</div> <p>Let me break it down for folks in more detail:</p> <ul> <li>To make this movie we will need $3,500 total.  Why are we only asking for $2,500 on IndieGoGo?  </li>
<li>This cost covers production with cast and crew (with their own equipment) payments, totaling at: $2,300 ...  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Another $200 goes to food, gas and any extra equipment rentals (we need to buy/return a motion stabilizer Z1-PROUND for our GoPro, the only piece of equipment that we do not have).  Once again, to shoot the film we will need $2,500.  The extra cost of $1,000 will go to Promotional Costs and Fulfilling Rewards.  This $1,000 is money that I have already saved up.  I used to pay for all of my movies, but I learned that since I am working for backend (potentially for free), I'd rather not go broke doing it.</span>
</li> <li>Speaking of rewards...  have you seen ours?  They're pretty amazing.  We're giving away producer packages (you can be a producer, as seen in the film and on IMDB, and there are only a few of these positions available), signed memorabilia, the product itself through Bluray, DVD or VOD (we plan to be on Amazon, much like our predecessor Zombie Cats is about to appear on), and much more stuff.  It's worth a look...</li> <li>If we do not make our goal, but get to keep the funds raised, we will continue to raise more money to make the film.   </li>
<li>If we raise more than our goal on IndieGoGo, we will do some cool reward add-ons.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>So for me to say that I want to make a feature film but that I need your help to do it, that's easy for me.  I could say dabababa, but it doesn't ensure that it means anything.  Why are you important?  <br/></p> <ul> <li>You are important to me if you like the yarn that we can spin.  You are important, because you're, like me, looking to make something brazen, different and totally unique.</li> <li>As you saw above, I'm not foreign to making feature films.  In fact, if you have seen either one of my most recent features, you will see that they contain very long and eloquent shots.  If you'd like to see me take it to the next level, I will surprise you in a good way.</li>
</ul>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435687745/blpminnvimc3ucyuqz2p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<ul> <li>This is a team effort.  I talk a lot about myself here, but really, none of it is possible without my friends and co-workers in the film industry.  We've got actors that have to learn all of their lines in this 96-Page Script (avg. 10 pages of dialogue per actor), crew members that have to choreograph where they point and shoot, lighting gurus that must be set up hours in advance to bring that awesome shot further, sound engineers that will be running a minimum of 8 microphones and moving them to different people/locations all throughout the film, plus the fact that anything can happen.</li>
<li>Understudies, the actors/actresses who show up to our rehearsals and learn all of the lines, just in case somebody drops out.  We have 4 understudies.  We are ready for anything.</li>
<li>You can help make it happen.  We can help advance and inspire indie films. </li>
</ul>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/>

Hello everyone, My name is Montetré.  I am a filmmaker (credentials) with six movies under my belt.  My newest romp in film was/is Zombie Cats from Mars.  I am making a new feature film that is a whole lot of fun, a whole lot of work and a whole lot of prep.  The film is to be completed while using only one continuous shot.  The movie is called Marty in Transit.  In this one, long take (to be anywhere from 85-110 Minutes, dependent on traffic), the audience will go on an adventure with Marty (the undercover FBI Agent), even go as far as experiencing his past moments, zipping from the real world to his memories with fluid motion.  This is based off of a 96 page script and it is being rehearsed with the full cast beginning July 7th, 2015.  A lot of us are already rehearsing together, to be prepared and off-book, since we shoot our rehearsal on Monday, July 13th.  That was actually a roaring success (tons of mishaps, but such a good rehearsal).  All actors and actresses have been cast, the crew has been found, equipment/camera necessary. We are merely missing the funds to make it happen.



The Story
Someone is going around killing Uber Cab Drivers and FBI Agent Marty has been sent undercover to track them down, posing as a driver for hire in his old, home town.  Chasing down rumors in a world that becomes smaller and smaller everyday, our story begins as Marty drives around picking seemingly normal people up.... Old wounds reopen in this place of lost love and hate, creeping up on him as faces of the past reemerge, always knowing that the killer is out there.  He or she could be one of many people, including Mob Boss and RadioCab Owner George Lively (Marty's old boss), or it could be the new, ridiculous and mysterious hitman Knick, or maybe it's the elusive femme fatale....Veronica.  The list of suspects gets smaller as the day wears on.  One thing is certain, Marty wants his life to go back to normal.  He wants out of this town.  The only way to do that, is to track and snare The Cabby Killer.

My last feature film had a turnaround time of 6 months, from conception to release.  It was called Zombie Cats from Mars.  You may have heard of it.  With that film, we desired to make fun of schlocky movies from the 50's.  Above is the DVD Cover Art.

With Marty in Transit the film is about love lost, killers on the run and self-discovery.  It's also hilarious and bad-ass.  Marty will be entirely in color, but the sound design is something quite ingenious, as it involves the main character's wire tap (the FBI Agent wears a wire), so wherever that wire goes, that is what the audience hears.  It gets kind of trippy, as sometimes the camera will be away from the wire, watching another character as we can still hear the main character with their wire.  That isn't to say that there is only one microphone being used in the film, but actually a great glob of them (8, to be precise, all brought precisely throughout the city of Portland with the actors and camera crew, in some instances set-up in advance). 
Here is a map of our actual expenditure on that we performed on July 13th.  Things got crazy in the downtown region, so we have decided to shoot the actual film in the Eastside of Portland, where there is much less traffic, but, it'll have a lot of twists and turns similar to our original route below:


 Can I do This?
I did not go to film school.  Everything that I have learned has been through doing.  The long take is something that I believe will help strengthen/inspire independent filmmakers like myself. I can and will make a feature film on a very low budget with your support.  Here is why:


1. = It's only one day of work/filming.  We have technical meetings with the crew twice a week (one in person, one through conference call).  We have 3 rehearsals with the entire cast and crew coming up (below is an exterior picture of our rehearsal space for three days, an old furniture warehouse being run by Multicultural organization Jade/APANO.  The pictures after that is the inside (what it looks like now).  That entire room is ours to use!  It's huge!!!: 







......On July 13th, we actually did a complete run-through in the city, with all of the crew and actors (following the map above by memory).  This was very important to us as it helped enable everyone to know exactly where to stand. We also will have a few drive-arounds in our new region (that is, driving the new route in the Eastside with the crew before the run-through), before finally filming with the camera-ready cast.  Once again, we began rehearsals on July 7th.  We plan to shoot it Late August.  Check out our 5th update to see a great example of what our rehearsals accomplish!


2. = Money, I know how to save it on and off set.  The fact is that you don't need a great amount of money to make a movie if that small budget suits the film in question.  With my Marty in Transit, I'd like to shoot at a budget of $2,500 a day and like I said, for only one day.  Most films (even the indies), can cost much more during filming (even without A-List Actors, as these films tend to have a comparably gigantic -and I am sure a very talented - lot of crew members), but if the film were to be shot at 2.5k a day for 20 days (a normal filming timeframe), you'd end up with a film that cost $50,000.  And we aren't even talking post-production costs (for us, there are NO Post-Production costs, as I will be editing the sound design and doing the Black and White Color Correction; simply promotional costs are what Post-Production holds for us).  Marty in Transit will cost a grand total of $3,500 to make (including production/color-correcting/promotion), all because we're making a high-end movie with only one day of filming. 

3. = Time, I know how to use it.  My standard is this, really: I want to make a movie.  So, you know, I'm already inspired, the script's written, blah, blah, blah, but now...  I'm in the position to find a cast and a crew.  I have to be on a major hunt for people willing to commit.  These people are REAL PEOPLE, they have real lives and I must work around them.  Inevitably, I still want to make this movie.  So, without compromising artistic integrity, ""Ha, artistic integrity coming from the guy who made Zombie Cats from Mars,"" like I was saying, I must be willing to work around people's lives.  These people want to be in this movie, they have these, ""Obligations,"" but in the end, if I'm honest and good at hearing them out, we can make a movie together.  Basically, to successfully shoot a movie it's all scheduling (as long as you have the money).  
   What We Need & What You Get




 Let me break it down for folks in more detail:  To make this movie we will need $3,500 total.  Why are we only asking for $2,500 on IndieGoGo?  
This cost covers production with cast and crew (with their own equipment) payments, totaling at: $2,300 ...  Another $200 goes to food, gas and any extra equipment rentals (we need to buy/return a motion stabilizer Z1-PROUND for our GoPro, the only piece of equipment that we do not have).  Once again, to shoot the film we will need $2,500.  The extra cost of $1,000 will go to Promotional Costs and Fulfilling Rewards.  This $1,000 is money that I have already saved up.  I used to pay for all of my movies, but I learned that since I am working for backend (potentially for free), I'd rather not go broke doing it.
 Speaking of rewards...  have you seen ours?  They're pretty amazing.  We're giving away producer packages (you can be a producer, as seen in the film and on IMDB, and there are only a few of these positions available), signed memorabilia, the product itself through Bluray, DVD or VOD (we plan to be on Amazon, much like our predecessor Zombie Cats is about to appear on), and much more stuff.  It's worth a look... If we do not make our goal, but get to keep the funds raised, we will continue to raise more money to make the film.   
If we raise more than our goal on IndieGoGo, we will do some cool reward add-ons.

The Equipment We are using a GoPro HERO4 Black with 2.7 K Quality for three main reasons:  Small Size (Maneuverability inside of the Car), Wide Lens (More to See, Plus it's all in Focus, So no need to cram a Focus Puller in our trunk), Weight (Have to Carry it for 2 hours Straight, Camera Operators will Actually have to Switch Hands at a few Checkpoints):

The GoPro will be Stabilized (No Shaky Cam), with the BeStableCam, a piece of Equipment that Just Released and also allows us to Have Motion Tilt (there is a remote on the handle that allows the user to actually look around without physically moving the camera yourself), see below:
The Go Pro and BeStableCam will hook up to an HDMI splitter, with one Cord going to an individual LCD Screen attached to the back of the GoPro (for viewing purposes),  and the other running to our Atomos Ninja.  The shogun allows us to record directly to hard drive, as we will need at the most 500 GB of space for what will become one long take (an average 3 to 4 GB a minute!!).  To keep the Shogun from Over-heating, it will be placed in a shoulder-strapped bag with covered ice packs and a hole made in the bag so that the Device can Breathe:


The Impact So for me to say that I want to make a feature film but that I need your help to do it, that's easy for me.  I could say dabababa, but it doesn't ensure that it means anything.  Why are you important?    You are important to me if you like the yarn that we can spin.  You are important, because you're, like me, looking to make something brazen, different and totally unique. As you saw above, I'm not foreign to making feature films.  In fact, if you have seen either one of my most recent features, you will see that they contain very long and eloquent shots.  If you'd like to see me take it to the next level, I will surprise you in a good way.


 This is a team effort.  I talk a lot about myself here, but really, none of it is possible without my friends and co-workers in the film industry.  We've got actors that have to learn all of their lines in this 96-Page Script (avg. 10 pages of dialogue per actor), crew members that have to choreograph where they point and shoot, lighting gurus that must be set up hours in advance to bring that awesome shot further, sound engineers that will be running a minimum of 8 microphones and moving them to different people/locations all throughout the film, plus the fact that anything can happen.
Understudies, the actors/actresses who show up to our rehearsals and learn all of the lines, just in case somebody drops out.  We have 4 understudies.  We are ready for anything.
You can help make it happen.  We can help advance and inspire indie films. 

Risks & Challenges
 It should really be called Murphy's Law in Transit, huh?  Who do we think we are, trying to do this?  Well, we are excited and outgoing, ready for the challenges that will face us.  And trust me, there is a new challenge everyday, as half of the film takes place in a car, we are lucky as everyone (minus camera movement), is stationary during these scenes.  You may ask, what if there's traffic?  Yes, this is a concern.  As the other half of the film has us all on foot, we will be walking around town and being nuts directly in full view of the public.  So, you may ask, what if somebody disturbs us, or what if an actor/actress cannot remember a line?  Finally, what about this whole, one long shot idea?  And intermixing Uber, what's that about?  Traffic is a part of human existence.  For instance, if we are 4 minutes late to a location that happens near the end of the film, we will have a dedicated crew with walkie-talkie communication, informing all cast/crew of our set-backs in time. With the police, we are on good terms with them in Portland and they know what we will be doing, mostly in the privacy of our own car for anywhere from 85 - 110 minutes.
If somebody disturbs us, or if an actor drops a line, it will be okay.  We have a total of at least 10 three to five hour rehearsals with the entire cast (which includes going out during the doing a real world run-throughs), plus tech rehearsals for good knowledge of the equipment.  As it stands, right now every actor is learning their lines, to be off-book by our first rehearsal on July 7th.  These actors are all also very skilled at improvisation.  They were hand-picked by yours truly.  Every time that I have had the pleasure to act with or direct them their improvisational skills, mixed with their high-degree for learning lines, leaves a great impression on me.  
The outlandishness of the real world captured by our cameras makes for the silliness of our film seem more sound of mind, that is to say, more real (traffic is this way, too).  Actually, without giving much away, what if I told you that the actors break the fourth wall at times?  Well, they do.  And these lines are deep, funny, awkward, weird, you know, the actors when talking to the camera, they feel real....  Therefore, any mistakes made in the film will truly feel intentional.  I hate to say that the script is foolproof, but...  There's a lot of leeway in this exciting tale.  This particular idea is very much inspired by the Dogme 95 films, or even older films from the likes of Godard and Truffaut; the public act as a natural order of things, giving a sense of realism (as it is really a consistent parade of people), even though the film itself could seem so outlandish.

Marty in Transit  was born out of a desire to make a feature film with one shot, done by a masterful cinematographer and with amazing, unknown actors involved.  The film is planned to premiere one week to a month after shooting, as there is no editing that needs to be done.  We only need to work on sound design and color correction.  A real test of this movie is seeing how fast a feature film can be made, correctly.

<p><b>Upside Town </b>is a short fiction film that aims to expose sexism and speciesism in our society with a light comedy tone. </p>
<p>For some people everyday life revolves around daily routines that we have become a custom to over time. These are social codes. Even though we're know in the 20th century these so called 'rules of conduct' are slowly breaking apart however they still exist to some extent. Ask yourself,  What would life be like if for one day the social codes and 'rules' of behaviour suddenly got inverted? Would we still follow this rules unquestionably or would things start to change. For Barney this question becomes reality and this film is going to explore the  numerous possibilities.</p>
</div><div>Everybody Welcome ... Barney!  A quite stocky balding man in his late 30's who loves nothing more than sitting around in his underwear, watching TV, surrounded by food leftovers while his wife, Rita, runs around the house cleaning up after him. When Barney suddenly chokes on a chicken wing one day, he's world is turned upside down and he discovers over time with help from his friend, James, that the parallel universe he's be placed in has its social codes inverted. Barney is now expected to look presentable all the time. Clean cut hair, perfectly manicured nails, teeth scrubbed and flossed, legs and armpits to be waxed so there silky smooth, eyebrows to be plucked to perfection and last but not least, to get some fancy perfume on to smell nice and finish it all off with a big sparkling smile. </div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Unfortunately Barney is confused by this and slowly starts to reject the social codes. Once Barney and James have finished cooking dinner for their not so presentable wives, Barney becomes the laughing stock because of his looks, weight, questions on his house-husband duties and also because he's not so keen on trying out the lovely roast Cat for dinner.  When Barney starts choking on his first piece of roast Cat he gets flung back into everyday reality. He is sat on his favourite chair surrounded by food leftovers feeling bewildered when his wife Rita walks into the room. He turns the TV off, throws away his carton of fried chicken and goes over to his wife.  The big question is, has Barney been changed by his experience and will it change his lifestyle? Maybe, once in a blue moon we should all stop and look around just to see and think about the social rules we are accepting and wether they are fair and just or not.</span>

Women themselves also sometimes refuse to see the problem and are unaware of the social rules we just take on without questioning"" - Adele Biraghi, Director and Writer of Upside Town.<div>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Unfortunately</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> making a film costs quite a bit, Hiring locations and equipment to paying for our cast and production design, in the end it all adds up. And this is why where asking for your </span>generosity<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to please donate and help us make Upside Town reality. So here is a a break down of our costs to make this film in a nice little pie chart. </span></span></p>

<b></b><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Pre Production</b><br/></p>
<p>For Pre-Production we've put 10% aside of our budget to pay for location scouting, the deposit on locations, inviting actors for auditions and meeting them for rehearsals as well as all the research that will be needed for this project (it'll shock you how much research goes into making a short film).</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Cast</b></span></p>
<p>For our Cast we've put 26% aside of our budget. For this film were not focused on the looks of our actors we want pure talent so we might as well do this the proper way and that is the costly way too. Were going to have 4 different actors for this film, 2 males to play Barney and James and two women to play their wives Rita and Laura.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Locations</b></span></p>
<p>Locations in London for free or a cheap price is literally a mission impossible. Usually you find the perfect location and then find out there's an extra filming fee on top. We don't want to cut any corners and are refusing to do so, So when we find that perfect location that will make our film complete we have reserved 30% of our budget to cover all the costs. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Production Design</b></span></p>
<p>Probably one of the most important parts of a film, without production design you don't get the real feel of the film, there will be no atmosphere. If part of the script says a scene is in a living room you've got to make it look and feel like a proper living room that someone lives in, it can't just be an empty room with a chair. So for Production Design we've put 15% of our budget aside to turn our locations and sets into the home of Barney and Rita, as well as this our production designer will be in charge of our characters costumes to complete the perfect look to our film.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Set Expenses</b></span></p>
<p>The time flies by when your having fun and shockingly a 12 hour day filming does just fly by however, without food or drink this is impossible! We need to feed our cast and crew and make sure everyone is happy and content to get the full out of our team so for this we've allocated 10% of our budget.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Festival Submissio</b></span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">ns</b></p>
<p>Where all in this for the long run and to help us get recognised what better way is there than entering the completed film into some film festivals around the UK and rest of the world! Even though we've allocated 9% of our budget towards this we also would like to use some of this money towards post production costs i.e. colour grading and hiring a sound proof room in a studio for our sound designer.</p>

Upside Town is a short fiction film that aims to expose sexism and speciesism in our society with a light comedy tone. 
For some people everyday life revolves around daily routines that we have become a custom to over time. These are social codes. Even though we're know in the 20th century these so called 'rules of conduct' are slowly breaking apart however they still exist to some extent. Ask yourself,  What would life be like if for one day the social codes and 'rules' of behaviour suddenly got inverted? Would we still follow this rules unquestionably or would things start to change. For Barney this question becomes reality and this film is going to explore the  numerous possibilities.
Everybody Welcome ... Barney!  A quite stocky balding man in his late 30's who loves nothing more than sitting around in his underwear, watching TV, surrounded by food leftovers while his wife, Rita, runs around the house cleaning up after him. When Barney suddenly chokes on a chicken wing one day, he's world is turned upside down and he discovers over time with help from his friend, James, that the parallel universe he's be placed in has its social codes inverted. Barney is now expected to look presentable all the time. Clean cut hair, perfectly manicured nails, teeth scrubbed and flossed, legs and armpits to be waxed so there silky smooth, eyebrows to be plucked to perfection and last but not least, to get some fancy perfume on to smell nice and finish it all off with a big sparkling smile. 
Unfortunately Barney is confused by this and slowly starts to reject the social codes. Once Barney and James have finished cooking dinner for their not so presentable wives, Barney becomes the laughing stock because of his looks, weight, questions on his house-husband duties and also because he's not so keen on trying out the lovely roast Cat for dinner.  When Barney starts choking on his first piece of roast Cat he gets flung back into everyday reality. He is sat on his favourite chair surrounded by food leftovers feeling bewildered when his wife Rita walks into the room. He turns the TV off, throws away his carton of fried chicken and goes over to his wife.  The big question is, has Barney been changed by his experience and will it change his lifestyle? Maybe, once in a blue moon we should all stop and look around just to see and think about the social rules we are accepting and wether they are fair and just or not.
Directors Cut: ""I want to make this film because it's a subject that's really close to my heart, to find a way to expose sexism in a light that can be understood by everyone without being boring, cheesy or pedantic about it. I feel like sexism and speciesism are so rooted in western society's that men - not the bad, not the violent, but the good and tender men that women choose to spend the rest of their lives with struggle to see the existence of the problem. Women themselves also sometimes refuse to see the problem and are unaware of the social rules we just take on without questioning"" - Adele Biraghi, Director and Writer of Upside Town.

Unfortunately making a film costs quite a bit, Hiring locations and equipment to paying for our cast and production design, in the end it all adds up. And this is why where asking for your generosity to please donate and help us make Upside Town reality. So here is a a break down of our costs to make this film in a nice little pie chart. 


Pre Production
For Pre-Production we've put 10% aside of our budget to pay for location scouting, the deposit on locations, inviting actors for auditions and meeting them for rehearsals as well as all the research that will be needed for this project (it'll shock you how much research goes into making a short film).

Cast
For our Cast we've put 26% aside of our budget. For this film were not focused on the looks of our actors we want pure talent so we might as well do this the proper way and that is the costly way too. Were going to have 4 different actors for this film, 2 males to play Barney and James and two women to play their wives Rita and Laura.
Locations
Locations in London for free or a cheap price is literally a mission impossible. Usually you find the perfect location and then find out there's an extra filming fee on top. We don't want to cut any corners and are refusing to do so, So when we find that perfect location that will make our film complete we have reserved 30% of our budget to cover all the costs. 
Production Design
Probably one of the most important parts of a film, without production design you don't get the real feel of the film, there will be no atmosphere. If part of the script says a scene is in a living room you've got to make it look and feel like a proper living room that someone lives in, it can't just be an empty room with a chair. So for Production Design we've put 15% of our budget aside to turn our locations and sets into the home of Barney and Rita, as well as this our production designer will be in charge of our characters costumes to complete the perfect look to our film.
Set Expenses
The time flies by when your having fun and shockingly a 12 hour day filming does just fly by however, without food or drink this is impossible! We need to feed our cast and crew and make sure everyone is happy and content to get the full out of our team so for this we've allocated 10% of our budget.
Festival Submissions
Where all in this for the long run and to help us get recognised what better way is there than entering the completed film into some film festivals around the UK and rest of the world! Even though we've allocated 9% of our budget towards this we also would like to use some of this money towards post production costs i.e. colour grading and hiring a sound proof room in a studio for our sound designer.



For the special people who wish to donate and help share and support our campaign we have some very special rewards for you! These range from personalised postcards, to special thank you video messages right down to getting the chance to be our executive or associate producer and being invited to a special screening of the film with a meet and greet of the crew where you can ask us anything your heart desires about the film.

Your helping us with our careers and can give us the publicity we need to make this film and also our futures. Any donations will help, if its from £1 up to £100 any amount will help and every bit of support counts and we will be eternally grateful!

We are looking to change the game in how fighting films are told, and how women are perceived. In this day and age, we have seen a revolution in women's roles in society and we hope our film will kick off what will be a trend in the genre.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<div>My name is Darren MacDonald, and my idea is a short film called ""Drunken Bastard"".  This will be my first film outside of film school, and I need YOUR help making it.   <br/>
</div>
<div>
<p>Drunken Bastard is a Post-Apocalyptic western comedy
about a character, called The Mountie and he is being hunted down the antagonist Willie
“The Man Jack”, and his gang. But with one problem; the Mountie character is a
drunk.  The Mountie basically fumbles his
way past the gang to finally face off with Willie “The Man Jack” in the climax
of the film.  Does Mountie learn his
lesson and overcome his addiction? And why is Willie hunting down The
Mountie?  You’ll have to watch the film
to find out. <br/>It's like a mix of a typical western plot, mixed with Drunken Master and Mad Max.</p>Most film makers make movies based on experience, but my favourite director Edgar Wright tends to make movies about movies.  He takes the genres he loves, and makes films in those genres, and I like that style.  It's not about taking what other movies have done and putting it onto a screen, it's about making the movies I would watch, which motivates me to make this movie.  The morals of this story can be about overcoming personal barriers, about greed, and about not judging a book by its cover, all struggles I have had to overcome at one point of my life, making the idea that much more dear to me. </div>

<i>Character Posters for both The Mountie and Willie ""The Man Jack"".  Both shot on a DSLR we have, using normal house hold lights in our cluttered basement. </i>
</div>
<div>The movie is a fairly simple idea.  It's shot outside eliminating light set ups.  Keeping in the nature of Post-Apocalyptic a lot of the wardrobe ""Scavenger"" like, it makes it easier to make than if it was just western.  As of now we are gifted with a film crew that wants to just make movies and have agreed to shoot the film for free, all people who have gear they are willing to donate their gear, to help make a the film.  But with all the bonuses we have there are some things that need to be funded.  Food for the crew, gas to get to locations, wardrobe/props, and use for some post-production facilities that we do not have access to (Recording spaces and proper Colouring rooms).  Contribution is not mandatory which makes me even more greatful who wants to help make this film happen with your donations.  But your help won't go unnoticed, and there will be rewards to your kindness. <br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Basically here is what's needed:  <b>A grand total of $1000</b>.  The project is very wardrobe and prop heavy.  The style is very scavenger style but there are key things <span style=""background-color: initial;"">that are needed.  </span>

<p><b>IF WE DON'T REACH OUT GOAL</b></p>
<p>It's a question that I'd like to pretend didn't exist, but it's something that needs to be asked.  If the goal isn't reached, we plan on re-adjusting the money got.  Wardrobe and Props will stay the same (to a certain point), and money will be taken from the Post-Production to help with wardrobe. <br/><br/><b>If the goal is not met</b> the money will be redistributed.   Getting anything around 500$ would probably see <b>Wardrobe</b> bumping up to <b>35%</b>, and <b>props</b> up to <b>19%</b> but <b>gas</b> would drop down to <b>8%</b>, <b>craft services</b> would be down to <b>10%</b>.  <b>Perks</b> would stay at <b>10%</b>, while <b>post-production</b> costs would be<b> removed entirely</b>, and both <b>Contingency and Indiegogo</b> remain at<b> 9% </b>each.  <b>These percentages are based around $500 donations instead of $1000.</b> The quality of the film might dip if the goal isn't met, but quality would be based around wardrobe and props.  <br/></p>
<p>The advantage of having a film that's like this is that we can settle for less than is wanted for wardrobe, because the style of ""Post-Apocalyptic"" is very scavengerish.  More work will be needed to make it fit, but we have an Art-Department team of three who want to make good wardrobe and props.  Kevin Smith said in an interview for Tusk that sometimes you get creative when you are hurting in the money department, ways that help in the long run that would never happen if you have a full budget.  I am confident that our team can cope and roll with the punches if funding is not met. We have crew members already working for free with their own cameras, sound recording devices, so the look and sound will stay consistent.  I guarantee that the quality of the shots and the sound will be the best that we can make them despite not reaching the goal. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign determines whether or not this film is made.  The money donated will make this film.  Right now, I want this film made by people who want to see it made or by those who just want to help out.  This project is going to be open, I want people to be kept up to date, I want them to see the progress that is being made, and I want them to get into the making of it.  I get to make a film I want to make, and people get to see what their money is going towards.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Now the fun part about film isn't the numbers and raising and spending of money.  If you have talents or clothes help will be greatly appreciated!  </p>
<p>If you can design and create posters, write music, have props fitting to the movie, clothes fitting to the movie, love to cook for the crew (given how much we raise), painting, or ANYTHING contact me at Darren.MacDonald@live.com.  Nothing is better than seeing something you did up on the screen.  Community makes great films!</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cast and Crew</h3>
<div>Let us take a look at the nice women and men that are going to make this happen.  We might have someone for Lee, but it's still on the fence, but we are currently looking for an actress to play Eastwood.  I (the director) have worked on mostly everyone on this list before; <b>Rick</b>, <b>Mika</b>, <b>Renee</b> all worked on my Student thesis ""<b>The Killer Is Me</b>"", a Weird Western Film.  I've worked with <b>Kiefer</b> on many projects, I've worked with<b> Brendan</b> on the film he's making now; <b>Darkslide.</b> <b> KC</b> and <b>Sari </b>I look forward to working with.  </div>

   What We Need & What You Get

If the goal is not met the money will be redistributed.   Getting anything around 500$ would probably see Wardrobe bumping up to 35%, and props up to 19% but gas would drop down to 8%, craft services would be down to 10%.  Perks would stay at 10%, while post-production costs would be removed entirely, and both Contingency and Indiegogo remain at 9% each.  These percentages are based around $500 donations instead of $1000. The quality of the film might dip if the goal isn't met, but quality would be based around wardrobe and props.  
The advantage of having a film that's like this is that we can settle for less than is wanted for wardrobe, because the style of ""Post-Apocalyptic"" is very scavengerish.  More work will be needed to make it fit, but we have an Art-Department team of three who want to make good wardrobe and props.  Kevin Smith said in an interview for Tusk that sometimes you get creative when you are hurting in the money department, ways that help in the long run that would never happen if you have a full budget.  I am confident that our team can cope and roll with the punches if funding is not met. We have crew members already working for free with their own cameras, sound recording devices, so the look and sound will stay consistent.  I guarantee that the quality of the shots and the sound will be the best that we can make them despite not reaching the goal. 


The Impact
This campaign determines whether or not this film is made.  The money donated will make this film.  Right now, I want this film made by people who want to see it made or by those who just want to help out.  This project is going to be open, I want people to be kept up to date, I want them to see the progress that is being made, and I want them to get into the making of it.  I get to make a film I want to make, and people get to see what their money is going towards.   

Risks & Challenges
There are a lot of Risks and Challenges when it comes to making a film alone.  With this film the biggest risk is not meeting the goal.  If the goal isn't met the film will take longer to make.  We'll have more work, more scavenging and more saving up of personal money to make it happen.  Certain areas will hurt more than others if funding isn't met.  

Other Ways You Can Help
Now the fun part about film isn't the numbers and raising and spending of money.  If you have talents or clothes help will be greatly appreciated!  
If you can design and create posters, write music, have props fitting to the movie, clothes fitting to the movie, love to cook for the crew (given how much we raise), painting, or ANYTHING contact me at Darren.MacDonald@live.com.  Nothing is better than seeing something you did up on the screen.  Community makes great films!


Cast and Crew
Let us take a look at the nice women and men that are going to make this happen.  We might have someone for Lee, but it's still on the fence, but we are currently looking for an actress to play Eastwood.  I (the director) have worked on mostly everyone on this list before; Rick, Mika, Renee all worked on my Student thesis ""The Killer Is Me"", a Weird Western Film.  I've worked with Kiefer on many projects, I've worked with Brendan on the film he's making now; Darkslide.  KC and Sari I look forward to working with.

<h1>TOXIC TEMPTATION</h1>
<p><b>Logline: A short art film combining a poetic spoken word and strong cinematic visuals rich with subtext, debating the inability of a woman to find love based on fairytale expectations and her own life choices. </b></p>
<p><b>Toxic Temptation</b> is an open cinematic letter to the hearts of women and the minds of men. </p>
<p>Project creator, director, actress, and all around super girl, <b>Tatum Miranda</b>, sources the piece from her own personal life experiences and the desire to help others grow through the profession of her own hopes and dreams juxtaposed beautifully with her fears and faults. <b>It is the concept of the fairytale verse reality.</b> For in a world where a person’s value is determined in the time it takes for your thumb to swipe left or right, how can we accept the idea of the fairytale being anything else then a childhood fantasy. A spell to bewitch the dreams of young women to revolve around the idea of a man completing her verses a man complimenting her. And yet, that is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431718004/xqswayezcbjy1cp7schz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The fairytale idea of love is the temptation. The reality is what we are given and betrayed by. The prize is not the woman but rather her body. Lust dictates drive. It becomes hard to see who you truly are when another’s interpretation dictates your reality. <b>Every girl is raised to be a princess</b>… but a princess is destined to marry a prince. Their lives are dictated by the desire to complete that connection.</p>
<p><b>Thus we are left with a strange conclusion:</b> Beauty is a double edged sword. Men lust for it, women strive for it…but actually being considered a “beauty”…its more curse then blessing. The irony of being beautiful, is that the feature that should make you more attractive to people suddenly has more problems then it is worth. When a man encounters the embodiment of his purest attraction, one of two things generally happens. Faced with rejection many men don’t even talk to her, but of those that do, most think her talking back means she is easy. It’s funny how fast beauty metamorphosis’s into pretty…hot…sexy… and suddenly it’s all about sex. Lust steps forward and all thoughts of the real woman get thrown out the window. In a matter of moments the fairytale has ended before it was even given a chance to begin. And yet, there is no solace in other woman. Seeing the object of their wishes, most women shun this Beauty for fear of being overshadowed by her presence, or losing what they already have. Fear rises, jealousy takes over, and the object of men’s lust becomes the object of their cruelty. For what better way to crush a threat then stifle its voice. Reputations are such fragile things. In the end, both parties mark her as outcast… desired by all, but loved by few…for who would willingly choose to walk next to this perfect pariah, this breathtaking beast, this fairytale figure…the beauty with the unsung ending.</p>

<p><b>This piece is about opposites. </b>It is about Beauty and Ugliness. Pain and Pleasure. Fire and Water. Symmetry and Asymmetry. Power and Subjugation. Society and Self. Fairytales and Realities. True love…and the Lies we find instead. This is an <b>experimental film</b>seeking to purge the chains someone has placed on themselves in an attempt to awaken those still bound by their own. Like any one person, this piece is more then its individual parts and its true value can only be gleaned with an open mind and a willingness to understand. We are the sum of our parts…both seen and unseen… both the good and the bad… incredibly simple, and yet utterly complex.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Toxic Temptation is about finding oneself </b>within this maelstrom of opposites life throws our way, taking from it what we will, and reimagining ourselves outside of the regurgitated interpretations society spits back. </p>

<p>This idea of opposites will be reiterated over and over again. As such, the project has a very demanding challenge for the crew. Emphasis will be placed on creating incredibly strong visuals that showcase this beauty and its counterpart. Certain areas will be rich with colors, while some will have almost none. Barren dungeons verses densely decorated gardens. Tight frames with heavy movement verses wide frames focusing on stillness. An epic score sweeping in cut by moments of dense silence. Beautiful soft lighting in a colorful room verses a single hard backlight cutting the darkness through prison bars… <b>Starting to get the picture?</b></p>
<p><b>But, why spoken word?</b> Well, there is something compelling about the simplicity of this poetry based platform that combines passion and vulnerability with a sense of truth. Truth being, the deconstruction of strong beliefs imbued with the strength of the reader that somehow divulges into a sense of self. It is not an act, but rather a ritual to impart a true sense of someone’s emotions tied to ideas. Like the shamans of old, experiences are being passed on through these “words of power” that open the listeners mind to their own thoughts and discussions. <b>Toxic Temptation doesn’t need discussion…it craves it.</b></p>

</div></div>","THE HUNTING PARTY FILM


Three bohemian boys have their last epic night together. With nothing else to lose, they escape into the heart of Antigua looking for love, adventure and answers.
They find them in the form of Agnes, a mysterious Israelite and Genevieve, the french globetrotter.  Between booze and the backdrop of this colonial town, the three of them fall in love with the two. 
A story about world travellers, home, and what it means to find oneself in a place where you can be anyone you want to be.
