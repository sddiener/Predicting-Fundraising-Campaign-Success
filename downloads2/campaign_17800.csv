technical crew, as well as paying for props, costumes, the hire of the

<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p><span><span><span>While
Alice Springs has a healthy theatre sector, there is a strong need
for further, ongoing stimulation of theatre production in this
community. My project will deliver needed stimulation through a production grown and owned in Alice Springs. The presentation of this
project as a theatrical production is dependent on support from
artists and art workers within a community – it cannot be a
'one-woman' show. This is the biggest and most ambitious show I've ever created. Previously, I've have created and performed short pieces of stand-up comedy, short plays and spoken word. This is the first full length play that I have written and I am also producing it and performing in it. However, its success also depends on your support. I hope you will make a donation and I hope you will come to see it! By helping to make this production a success, you will be contributing to building a show which could be toured interstate, such as to the Adelaide Fringe Festival.<br/></span></span></span></p>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>All projects are not without risks. For example, a member of the cast may fall ill. Or the 100 year flood may actually arrive before the show starts and the Totem Theatre may be swept away!</p>
<p>But I can improvise and so can my team. I am a problem solver and I have the skills to make this project work. While undertaking a Bachelor of Information Studies over the past six years, I have learned about project management and leading and managing teams, among many other things. I also have many years of experience in organising and managing community events.

  Risks & Challenges All projects are not without risks. For example, a member of the cast may fall ill. Or the 100 year flood may actually arrive before the show starts and the Totem Theatre may be swept away!

Other Ways You Can Help If you can't afford to contribute, you can still help my campaign. You can:  Get the word out and make some noise about Welcome To My Cuntry and my fundraising campaign. 
 You can use the Indiegogo share tools to put the word out on social media!   Thank you and I hope to see you at the Totem Theatre in Alice Springs in September, 2016!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The Festival and the Play</h3>
<p>The Thespis Festival in New York City has only been around for five years, and is already one of the largest and most highly renowned one-act play festivals in the country.  It was created by a group of playwrights who—after their own experiences having their plays produced in festivals—came together to create the ultimate festival.  It takes place at the Hudson Guild Theatre in downtown Manhattan, a beautiful and well-appointed 99-seat proscenium space.</p>
<p>I’m Jonathan Samarro, and my recently published play, <i>Grandma Serafina’s Famous Tiramisu</i>, has been one of the plays selected for this year’s festival.</p>
<p>The play, itself, is an homage to my grandparents—both Italian immigrants who lived on the outskirts of New York, just across the river in Hackensack, New Jersey. While the play certainly takes great pleasure in celebrating their culture, it also explores how its patriarchal traditions leave little room for people to honor their authentic selves. Through its comedy, the play examines the pain of not being “seen” by one’s family and the pain of surrendering one’s true self to accommodate familial expectations. At the comic center of the play is Serafina, whose lifelong surrender has at long last taken a wicked little turn.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>If you don’t already know, in festival theatre, playwrights act as their own producers, but with the Thespis Festival, playwrights are not only provided with a beautiful theatre space, but also an online ticketing service and access to a wide selection of furnishings, lights, and audio equipment—keeping production costs to a minimum.</p>
<p>To make our show happen at this year’s festival, we need your help to cover some of the remaining production costs—including costumes, props, programs, and renting rehearsal space.  Any donation you can make would be appreciated.</p>

I am a graduate of the Devised Theatre &amp; Design program at York University. Concurrent with my education, I have worked (in some aspect of theatre, or another) internationally in cities such as Antwerp, Prague and Edinburgh. I have assisted renown theatre designers such as Peter McKinnon, Phillip Silver and most recently, Broadway and television actress, Tovah Feldshuh who is best known for her role as Golda in <i>Golda's Balcony </i>and as Deanna Monroe in <i>The Walking Dead.</i></p>
<p>I realize most independent theatre does not speak to a large portion of my generation. Truthfully, is also not necessarily their first choice on the ""things to do tonight"" list...and understandably so due to the popularity of ""home-comfort entertainment"" -- the internet, movies, television, video games. In response to this observation, our company wants to create theatre that <i>absolutely needs to be seen live</i> by using the power of surprise: an experience the comfort of your home cannot give you. We primarily focus on creating unexpected musical events within a theatrical setting that make our audience feel part of a shared experience.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>We need $5,000 for this project. You will be contributing to the following project fundamentals: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Venue rental </b>(The Baltimore House, 43 King William Street, Hamilton, Ontario. Includes full sound and lighting fixtures, light control console, mixer, licensed and operational bar, SOCAN licensed, capacity: 80-100)</li>
<li>
<b>Sound equipment purchases/rentals </b>(Pyle vintage-style microphone and swing stand, 1 monitor, 4 amplifers [vocal, electric piano, electric guitar &amp; bass], 7 headset microphone wireless systems, 1 drum kit harness, 1 clarinet rental etc.)</li>
<li><b>A professional tuning of the in-house piano</b></li>
<li>
<b>Prop purchases </b>(2 domestic fans, pack of confetti, earphones, 10 slices of fresh cheese pizza [for every show] and 10 different toppings etc.)</li>
<li>
<b>Printing costs </b>(15 copies of the script, schedule, contract, full score/libretto, 50 posters, 120 postcards, 100 show programs etc.)</li>
<li>
<b>Costume purchases/rentals </b>(13 jazz hats, white dress shirts, black pants, fabric for waist/neck scarves, various styles of suspenders, ornamented and custom design suit jacket for pianist, fox-onesie for singer etc.)</li>
<li>
<b>Transportation </b>(van rental for load-in/load-out, car/GO Bus fare to and from Hamilton for festival events such as Art Crawl, Hamilton Fringe Company Launch etc.)</li>

<h3>The Perks</h3>
<div><ul>
<li>Two free tickets to the show</li>
<li>A bound, transposed copy of our pianist, Luc Gaylie's insanely complicated piano solo</li>
<li>An original love song written FOR YOU by Hayley Pace and Luc Gaylie. The song will be recorded by the band and emailed to you as a .mp3 file</li>
<li>A cover of your favourite song</li>

<li>If you're really nice, the full band will play right at your doorstep!</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The power of surprise removes us temporarily from everyday life and inspires us to believe the unexpected is possible. This is especially powerful when there is no division between the performer and the audience. In the midst of excitement and ecstasy, we watch a musician pour their heart into their music and we, as the spectator, relate with this passion and vulnerability.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We want to create something that is loud, energetic and accessible to a non-theatre going audience -- something impossible to feel from the comfort of the home. With your contribution, we are working towards making a shared music experience that is affordable and with respect to the limitations of budgeting for independent theatre.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Previous projects include YUFFA Fringe's <i>Nudity, Free Beer, Good For Kids </i>which premiered at the 2015 Edinburgh Festival Fringe raising nearly $800 with the help of a campaign. Because of your help, the show could tour to The Box Toronto and we played to a sold-out house, taking home the 2015 Audience Choice Award.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We are mostly comprised of university students and/or recent graduates of music and theatre programs. Our experience in show-making and music making is limited professionally to our time of study. To combat this challenge, we are seeking mentorship from our professors who are well-versed in these fields to guide the development of the show.

We strive to give our audiences an intimate and unique experience every time they join us and we believe this script fits perfectly into that vision.</p><p> </p><p>Dog Sees God is an “unauthorized parody” of the Peanuts. The kids are all grown up and hardly recognizable.  And of course, Charlie Brown - now CB - is at the center of it all.</p><p> </p><p>The loss of a childhood friend forces our guy into an identity crisis .... Good Grief! … and nobody seems to care. His sister is too busy with drama club, his ex-girlfriend is in lock up, and his friends are too high to help. With nowhere else to turn, he pours his heart out to a piano player – one of the kids he normally bullies – and their friendship has the entire school on edge</p><p>This play has so many wonderful things for us to explore … bullying, loss, friendship, drug uses … and it’s all through the lense of these characters that we all thought we knew.</p><p> </p><p>On top of a stellar story, we’ve assembled an incredible cast and booked a really neat and intimate venue for this show, but of course we still need to raise some funds to make this the best production possible.

We strive to give our audiences an intimate and unique experience every time they join us and we believe this script fits perfectly into that vision. Dog Sees God is an “unauthorized parody” of the Peanuts. The kids are all grown up and hardly recognizable.  And of course, Charlie Brown - now CB - is at the center of it all. The loss of a childhood friend forces our guy into an identity crisis .... Good Grief! … and nobody seems to care. His sister is too busy with drama club, his ex-girlfriend is in lock up, and his friends are too high to help. With nowhere else to turn, he pours his heart out to a piano player – one of the kids he normally bullies – and their friendship has the entire school on edgeThis play has so many wonderful things for us to explore … bullying, loss, friendship, drug uses … and it’s all through the lense of these characters that we all thought we knew. On top of a stellar story, we’ve assembled an incredible cast and booked a really neat and intimate venue for this show, but of course we still need to raise some funds to make this the best production possible. Anything raised will go towards costumes, props, renting set pieces, marketing and paying our actors for the time and effort they’ve dedicated to telling this story. If enough is raised, we would also use some of the funds raised to sponsor a few free performances, or  pay-what-you-can performances. We want to ensure that all members of our community, no matter their circumstances, have the opportunity to see our show. There are so many fantastic projects you can donate to this Holiday Season, we would be beyond grateful if you would consider contributing to our campaign.  Dog Sees God opens February 23rd at Pinwheel Arts & Movement Studio. For dates and ticket information, check out our website.  We’d love to see you there!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<b>What is a Batizado?</b>
</h1>
<p>A <i>batizado</i>
is a Capoeira ceremony where new students are symbolically introduced to the world-wide
Capoeira community and receive their first belt (corda). Other Capoeira Mestres, instructors and students are invited to the
ceremony, where they joyfully welcome the new <i>Capoeiristas </i>(people that play
Capoeira). As in many aspects of Capoeira, the <i>batizado</i> has its own symbolism and is a
very special event. It is not a competition but rather a weekend-long event filled
with community and activities where Capoeiristas share their knowledge and love
of this beautiful art form.</p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Helio Luiz</b>
has been a Bay Area resident since 2010, when he moved from Michigan. In the Capoeira
world, Helio is known as <i>Professor Sereno</i>.
He began his Capoeira training in 1992 with his uncle, and then trained in
different schools in Salvador, Brazil. He
also took dance classes with the respected Brazilian dance Masters Clyde Morgan,
Master King and Master Paquito. In 1999, through a project for low-income
families, Helio joined the Capoeira school A.C.M.B, directed by Mestre Bamba (which
Helio still belongs to today). For the past six years Helio has taught Capoeira in
Brazil and throughout the United States and Canada. For the past three years he
has been teaching Capoeira for families of all social-economic levels at the Berkeley YMCA,
Truve, Birdland Social Club, for at-risk kids in a program run by the city of San Francisco, at the Brazilian Center
in Sacramento and in other locations throughout the Bay Area and California.</p>
<p><b>Jadson Souza</b>
moved to the Bay Area in 2010 when he started his local Capoeira practice by giving
lessons on a playground of a nearby elementary school. He soon joined the team
at <i>Destiny Arts</i>, a twenty-five year old
nonprofit that teaches Bay Area youth violence-prevention through the arts.
Since working with <i>Destiny Arts</i>,
Jadson has taught in various elementary schools, dance and martial arts studios.
Jadson’s most rewarding work has been teaching Capoeira and music to
developmentally disabled adults at the <i>Clausen
House</i> in Oakland. Jadson currently offers an adult Capoeira program, a
children’s program in Alameda, and is part of the city of San Pablo’s <i>COPT</i> (<i>Childhood Obesity Prevention Task Force</i>). Jadson has
introduced Capoeira to more than fifty kids from San Pablo, California (in one year alone).  A city that has the third highest
rate of obesity in California. <br/></p>
<p><b>Instructor Alice (Piu-Piu) </b></p>
<p>Though originally from the Bay Area, Alice Riegert (Piu Piu) first 
laid eyes on capoeira at the Associacao de Capoeira Mestre Bimba in 
Salvador, Brazil. While on summer vacation in 2005, she went to a 
performance at the school and was so awe-struck by the martial art that 
she immediately started taking capoeira classes back in the US. She 
trained under Mestre Mariano of Capoeira Batuque in her university town 
of Santa Barbara and spent the summers training with Mestre Acordeon and
 Mestra Suelly at UCA in Berkeley. In 2008 she studied abroad in Brazil 
and came full circle, joining the Associacao the following year.</p>

<h3>What is Capoeira?</h3>
<p>Capoeira is a African Brazilian dance and martial art. The word Capoeira (pronounced KAP-oooo-ERA) can be defined as two separate things in Portuguese. The word ""capoeira"" refers to a small, remote clearing in a field of grass or sugarcane, or it can also mean a style of ritualistic, playful dance that emerged in Brazilian culture during slavery. These two things are connected: the clearing in the field was frequently a place where Capoeiristas practiced their dance, which needed to be held in secret. </p>
<ul></ul>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Capoeira's Impact</h3> <p></p>Capoeira is an incredible and unique African-Brazilian Art Form that not only strengthens and units the community, but also builds strong children, morally, mentally, and physically. For instance, when playing Capoeira, children make their own decisions - simple and complexes ones. It allows them to develop empathy, and care for one another, and it also promotes healthy competitive instincts that are necessary in a capitalist society. The main goal as a teacher, is to encourage and instill confidence into every student by way of this unique dance and martial art.</div><div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Katherine Cartusciello, Nick Cartusciello, and Coya Pruden have teamed up to bring this heartwarming short tale to the New Works Play Series theater festival in NYC. </p>
<p>Katherine, who graduated from Columbia University in 2016, majored in music composition in order to expand on her sound design background. </p>
<p>Coya Pruden, who graduated from Columbia University in 2017, danced, acted, and cirque'd around professionally for 10 years before returning to school to study politics, human rights, and Slavic studies.</p>
<p>Nick Cartusciello, who graduated from Rutgers University, is an actor, dancer, singer, mime, director, and teacher of theater to children all around the world.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Latchkey Kid is an interdisciplinary musical, with a heavy focus on dance and movement. Since we will depend on dancers to depict the tale (while the Narrator describes their actions and eggs them on), we need rehearsal space with proper floors and a decent amount of space in which to move around.</p>
<p>Our cast is small (8 performers, total!) which means that our actors and dancers will be playing multiple roles in rapid succession. To execute this without confusion, we will rely on costumes and props to help differentiate between the roles. </p>
<p>Finally, we believe in the power of theater and imagination, and the good they can contribute to the world. We want to pay homage to that.  We not only want to produce a good quality show that appeals to the emotions of our audiences, but be ethical by offering a small stipend to our non-equity talent.</p>
<p>Our funds will go, first and foremost, to rehearsal space. Once we have that squared away, we will use our funds to provide our performers with costumes and props. Any remaining funds will go towards the stipends we offer to our performers and crew. </p>
<p>In return, we will send you downloadable versions of the artwork, as well as the full soundtrack!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Latchkey Kid is an equal-opportunity show. We, the creative team, strongly believe that art is a universal language, and therefore should be all-inclusive, and a celebration of the diversity that exists in this world.  The Latchkey Kid aims to use art as a tool to bring people together, and allow them to share the joys of theater, dance, and music, through the wonders of a child's imagination. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We want The Latchkey Kid to be a performance enjoyed by all, and in order to do so we require funds to help ease the financial burden involved. Putting on a show in New York City is difficult as it is, and we, the creative team, are recent graduates and are therefore just starting out. That is why we humbly ask for any help you can provide, as it is crucial to our success. </p>

<p>Hi! My name is Keely Cobb and I am the founder and artistic director of Around the Stage | Modern Dance Company. I am a graduate from the University of Nevada, Reno with a B.A in theater and a minor in dance. After graduation I began self-producing my own evening length works including<i> The Showbiz Cabaret </i>and<i> Relations </i>in Reno, NV. I am so excited to now be producing <i>Synopsis of This. </i>while presenting Reno's newest modern dance company, Around the Stage.</p>

<h3><strong>Here's the Synopsis: </strong></h3>
<p><i>Synopsis of This.</i> is a modern dance show mixed with some traditional acting techniques that explores the struggle of dependence versus independence found in our everyday lives. The word “synopsis” is added to the title because it references a general survey or summary of something. Within this work, the goal is to create a summary of events, objects, emotions, instances and connections that the audience can themselves relate to as being dependent on or as a reference of independence they have or once had in their own lives. It’s a show that breaks this fourth wall between audience and performer and allows a conversation to happen between them. This work contains multiple story lines told through a series of vignettes, or short scenes, that are at times quirky and silly and other times vulnerable and raw. The dancers have worked together to share their own stories of dependence and independence, through dressing yourself for the first time, needing that first cup of coffee in the morning, moving out, getting your first real job and asking that question of: “who am I in this relationship?” This is a show of failure, achievement, learning and growth and simply put, it’s the synopsis of life.</p>

In this production we bring together the ""realistic school"" of acting with Shakespeare. Acting in the realistic school is real life that happens in the context of a play. To achieve that with Shakespeare we maintain respect for the 400-year old language in its historical context while we look for contemporary resonance, as well. In short, we ""make sense"" of the language in a modern context.</p><p>Your contribution will help us bring the techniques and insights of the realistic school to bear on Shakespeare, as we revisit a venerable classic ""from the inside out,"" and experience it from the point of view of a character who in the original is a keen observer, but most often at the side commenting.</p><p>Our cast includes Elizabeth Bell, Sean Demers, Stephen Dym, George Enders, Judy Krause, Robert McKay, Mark Peters, Valerie Redd, Mike Roche, Henry Shikongo, Perri Yaniv, and Katie Zaffrann.</p><p>Producers have applied to present The Fool's Lear under the AEA Showcase Code.</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Your contribution will help pay for:</p><ul>
<li>Artist fees.</li>
<li>Space rental, for rehearsal and performance.</li>
<li> Graphics and media.</li>
</ul><p>In return, you could receive perks including:</p><ul>
<li>Your name in the program.</li>
<li>A program autographed by the cast and crew.</li>
<li>Special invitation to the dress rehearsal.</li>
<li>All of the above, plus associate producer credit.</li>
</ul><p>Contributions are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>With few exceptions, when one thinks of acting Shakespeare, one thinks of the precision and control of British actors. When one thinks of American acting, at least during the heyday of the Actors Studio, one thinks of gritty reality. With The Fool's Lear we are embarking on a journey to bring together the life in the context of the play, that is the hallmark of the realistic school, with the physical and vocal demands of Shakespeare. And the audience will see the play from the perspective of the Fool -- a character with a unique and privileged insight into the court, the family, the associates, and the person of King Lear.</p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><div>Producing in the Off-off Broadway setting is always challenging. Our production will compete with many others for the attention of the theater-going public. With the short rehearsal period and limited number of productions there's a risk that the production  will be unfinished, even in the closing performances.</div><div> </div><div>In the face of these risks and challenges we have our commitment to process. And we agree with the poet W.H.

In this production we bring together the ""realistic school"" of acting with Shakespeare. Acting in the realistic school is real life that happens in the context of a play. To achieve that with Shakespeare we maintain respect for the 400-year old language in its historical context while we look for contemporary resonance, as well. In short, we ""make sense"" of the language in a modern context.Your contribution will help us bring the techniques and insights of the realistic school to bear on Shakespeare, as we revisit a venerable classic ""from the inside out,"" and experience it from the point of view of a character who in the original is a keen observer, but most often at the side commenting.Our cast includes Elizabeth Bell, Sean Demers, Stephen Dym, George Enders, Judy Krause, Robert McKay, Mark Peters, Valerie Redd, Mike Roche, Henry Shikongo, Perri Yaniv, and Katie Zaffrann.Producers have applied to present The Fool's Lear under the AEA Showcase Code.What We Need & What You GetYour contribution will help pay for:
Artist fees.
Space rental, for rehearsal and performance.
 Graphics and media.
In return, you could receive perks including:
Your name in the program.
A program autographed by the cast and crew.
Special invitation to the dress rehearsal.
All of the above, plus associate producer credit.
Contributions are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.The ImpactWith few exceptions, when one thinks of acting Shakespeare, one thinks of the precision and control of British actors. When one thinks of American acting, at least during the heyday of the Actors Studio, one thinks of gritty reality. With The Fool's Lear we are embarking on a journey to bring together the life in the context of the play, that is the hallmark of the realistic school, with the physical and vocal demands of Shakespeare. And the audience will see the play from the perspective of the Fool -- a character with a unique and privileged insight into the court, the family, the associates, and the person of King Lear.Risks & ChallengesProducing in the Off-off Broadway setting is always challenging. Our production will compete with many others for the attention of the theater-going public. With the short rehearsal period and limited number of productions there's a risk that the production  will be unfinished, even in the closing performances. In the face of these risks and challenges we have our commitment to process. And we agree with the poet W.H. Auden that creating a work of art is itself a political act -- political not in a partisan sense, but in the sense of representing a community. Other Ways You Can HelpCan't contribute? You can still help by spreading the word among your friends and associates, particularly through social media.  You can use the Indiegogo share tools to help spread the word.***The Fool's Lear is being produced, in part, through Kori Rushton and IRT's Residency Season.

<h3>Like Me - The Social Media Musical<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>I like, therefore I am...</strong></p>
<p>A twist on the romantic comedy in which four young adults navigate the social media minefield, looking for each 
other, for love, for validation and ultimately, for themselves – in 
amongst a cyber world populated by thousands of ‘followers’ and 
‘friends’. Haunted by a lack of self-confidence and self-respect, <em>Emma</em>, <em>Ashley</em>, <em>Luke</em> and <em>Charlie</em>
 face physical, emotional and psychological challenges, leading them to 
question their very identity. Are they hiding behind their online profiles , or is there conviction in their tweets, pins, selfies, posts 
and status updates? Like the rest of the population, they’re digitally 
aware, armed with Wi-Fi enabled devices and online. <br/></p>
<p>Let the tagging 
begin...</p>
<p>Funny, touching and timely, <strong>Like Me</strong> explores 
how reliant we’ve all become on social media and how we live our digital
 lives often in stark contrast to our real world personae.</p>

<b></b><p><b>Like Me<i> </i></b>is a four-hand, full-book musical

altering how we communicate as human beings, how we present and promote
ourselves online and how we communicate with others – brands now enter into

post the photo evidence of those reunions through digital channels. Family
members choose to communicate with each other via social media platforms, rather

Like Me - The Social Media Musical



I like, therefore I am...
A twist on the romantic comedy in which four young adults navigate the social media minefield, looking for each

amongst a cyber world populated by thousands of ‘followers’ and

Funny, touching and timely, Like Me explores 
how reliant we’ve all become on social media and how we live our digital

Why this show? Why now?

Like Me is a four-hand, full-book musical

altering how we communicate as human beings, how we present and promote
ourselves online and how we communicate with others – brands now enter into

     on the stage, and driving Investors to that stage, which is exactly where
     you want them.
The
     Like Me Creative Team is uniquely qualified to produce this show. Over the
     course of the last decade we have written and starred in West End
     productions and have a background in social media, online marketing and
     communications.
We
     promise to treat our Funders as valued partners – we will keep you
     constantly updated with progress, casting and creative decisions through
     our exclusive ‘Backers’ e-Newsletter, for all backers contributing at over £10.


What happens to the money?

Like Me has built up a strong
following and with the help of an army of talented creatives, cast and
musicians we are ready to make this next big step, but we need your help to
make it as big as we possibly can! Funds from Indiegogo will be used for:

Cast, Creative Team and Crew: we
     will be casting talent from all across the country and recruiting some
     great people for behind the curtain as well.  The more money we
     raise, the bigger the Investor Showcase becomes and the more talent we can attract.
Stage/Set Design: With more money
     we can add value to the production with an exciting, innovative and
     digital stage design to enhance the stage experience. 
Investor Development: With so much quality on the stage we want to let potential show Investors know about it! We will be engaging Investors via social media to build awareness

<p>Allo!</p>
<p>Je suis Donya et je pratique la danse orientale depuis déjà 14 ans. Je
danse depuis que je suis toute petite et je compte bien encore danser quand je
serai toute vieille!</p>
<p>Quand je danse, rien d'autre ne compte que de vivre l'émotion et de la
faire vivre à mon public. En arabe, Donya veut dire « monde ». La
danse, c'est toute ma vie : mon monde tourne autour de cet art millénaire.
J'ai mon style propre, des tonnes de connaissances et surtout, l’immense
passion de partager ce que je sais!</p>
<p>Je rêve d'une carrière internationale et pour y arriver, je dois me
faire connaître. J'ai déjà commencé sur la côte est des États-Unis en
remportant la deuxième place ainsi que le choix du public au Delaware à
l’occasion de l’événement Jewels of the Orient. J’ai aussi remporté la deuxième
place au East Coast Classic. Pour poursuivre sur cette lancée, j’ai l'intention
de participer à plusieurs compétitions internationales dans la prochaine année,
notamment en Orégon, en Floride et en France.</p>
<p>Une carrière internationale, ça signifie d’enseigner dans des événements
à l’extérieur du Québec, de danser lors des galas, d’être juge lors des
compétitions et peut-être même de produire un CD et un DVD!</p>

<div>TalkSimple Productions, as well as producing a brand new show, is also starting up as a brand new company entirely in its own right.

<h3>Your Money!</h3>
<div>So, how will what you generously donate help us make 'Hearts of Folk' as good as it possibly can be? The breakdown of our major costs are as follows:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Venue Hire - £2600. We are performing at the very aptly named Paradise in the                                   Vault and this is the cost of hiring their theatre for the full run of the                                 Fringe between the 8th and 31st of August. There is no better place                                 than the Fringe for theatre so the longer we can be there the better!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Instruments/Cases - £200. No good, or indeed terrible band, can function without                                              these and the more the merrier! Sadly they don't come cheap                                            and we need your help to ensure <i>Hearts of Folk </i>are as kitted                                                out as possible!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Transport- £200. All those instruments that we need also need to get up to                                        Edinburgh and then back home again at the end, this means hiring vans                        and driving plenty!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Anything that you can give would be massively appreciated. It would help make this excellent show a reality and, better than that alone, a success.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you don't feel able to donate anything at this moment in time, but do think that this project sounds like something worth getting behind and supporting, then please please do share it with your friends via any method of social media you have access to or indeed that old fashioned way of word of mouth! Anything you can do to show us a little bit of love would be amazing and would genuinely mean the world to everyone involved. </p>
<p>Thank you so much in advance, we are truly grateful.</p>

<b>Kasuli
Francis is a trained and experienced dance performer and an aspiring
choreographer. Dancing is her way of living and a great source of
energy. Although Kasuli never got the chance to receive training
before entering Secondary School, she took the opportunity to watch
and practice movements and sequences from dance classes held at
former Primary School, Dunrobin Primary, music videos, and social
events and performances. She was often times laughed at by many,
including her high school dance teacher and dance mates, and even by
some of her family members. They poorly believed that she was good at
dancing. But with passion, dedication and practice she certainly
proved them wrong. Her family was not a big fan of the idea for
dancing as a career, but over time they realized how talented she was
and how much she could achieve. Kasuli's passion and drive for her
craft now inspires her family.</b></p>
<p>
<b>Dancing
is only one of the many talents that Kasuli has. She is also talented
in numerous areas such as; track and field, hair styling, sewing,
drawing, painting, cooking, and singing. Between the ages of seven
and thirteen she assisted her father, in his carpentry business. He
thought that she would have been an excellent carpenter. In Primary
School between the ages of six and eleven, Kasuli had an admiration
for her Aunt's career in nursing; who always saw it necessary to
assist and care for others.</b></p>
<p>
<b>Kasuli's
interest in teaching and choreographing sprung from an early age
group. On the weekends she would either play school with her dolls or
with the younger children in the neighborhood. At times, she would
even compose dance sequences for community events.<br/><br/>Between the
year 2002-2007, Kasuli gained her first dance experience at The
Queen's School, where she joined the dance team and participated in a
number of shows. It was also where she gained her first Latin dance
experience; Salsa, Merengue, and Cha Cha Cha. In the final year of
her attendance at the Queen's School 2006-2007 a friend introduced
her to the Caribbean Regals Entertainment, where she traveled around
Jamaica dancing and playing the bass steel pan.</b></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434666103/j7n4xwbzpcl7wny4n39l.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 606.863157894737px; height: 406px;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""<b>Phaedra</b>” is a Solo Dance performance. The aim is to deconstruct the classic text of ΄Hippolytus΄ by Euripides, while using pre-recorded sound on stage as well as narration of the Ancient Greek text. This fragmented narration is focused on the female figure and the negative emotions that the main character has been deluged. The dramaturgy and kinesiology are a study of gestures and movements coming straight from Ancient Greek culture and historical statues.</p>

<p>""Phaedra"" has been staged and successfully performed in <i>Platform Theatre</i> in London and <i>Conference and Cultural Centre</i> in Patras. We are delighted to announce that ""Phaedra"" is being accepted in Camden Fringe 2015 at <i>The Cockpit Theatre</i> as well as in the <i>Dansarte Centre</i>  in Patras, Greece and at the <i>UnityGate Festival</i>, Portugal. Furthermore, we are under discussion of touring ""Phaedra"" in other international venues within autumn/winter for the period of 2015-2016.<br/></p>

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Funding </h3> <p>The amount of funding we are aiming to raise in 45 days is £1,000 in order to complete and stage ""Phaedra"" in <i>London Camden Fringe 2015, Patras' Dansarte Centre, UnityGate in Portugal</i> and upcoming performances in different venues internationally. As evidence from the past few months of 2015, we have spent £600 out of our pocket in making the show, rehearsing and touring. The breakdown of the potential spending, so far, is as follows: £250.00 on venue hiring / The Cockpit Theatre, £60.00 on Camden Fringe festival participation, £150.00 on rehearsal space (15hours), £150.00 on sets &amp; props, £100.00 on flyer &amp; posters, £100.00 (approx.) on the operator and lighting designer, £200.00 (approx.) on travel expenses to Greece and Portugal and the rest of the amount to help us in buying advertisments and press release at both festivals. </p>

<br/><h3><b>Why Crowdfunding?</b></h3>
<p>""Phaedra"" is an ambitious project to date in collaboration between <i>Eirini Apostolatou  </i>and<i> Christiana Ioannou</i>. Although, is being truly successful in both London and Greece, all the expenses were covered by us. </p>
<p>To begin with, ""Phaedra"" has the possibility to become a big scale piece, due to its content that allows us to make a further development and research on its dramaturgy and kinesiology as a piece. By 'dramaturgy and kinesiology' we refer to bigger sets, more props and extensive rehearsals for research in the movement which is demanded. </p>

To conclude, ""Phaedra"" will be touring once again in Greece, Cyprus, Portugal, Spain and according to being successful upon application in other venues and festivals.</span><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px; text-align: center; background-color: initial;""></b></p>

</div>
</div></div>","Summary



""Phaedra” is a Solo Dance performance. The aim is to deconstruct the classic text of ΄Hippolytus΄ by Euripides, while using pre-recorded sound on stage as well as narration of the Ancient Greek text. This fragmented narration is focused on the female figure and the negative emotions that the main character has been deluged. The dramaturgy and kinesiology are a study of gestures and movements coming straight from Ancient Greek culture and historical statues.


""Phaedra"" has been staged and successfully performed in Platform Theatre in London and Conference and Cultural Centre in Patras. We are delighted to announce that ""Phaedra"" is being accepted in Camden Fringe 2015 at The Cockpit Theatre as well as in the Dansarte Centre  in Patras, Greece and at the UnityGate Festival, Portugal. Furthermore, we are under discussion of touring ""Phaedra"" in other international venues within autumn/winter for the period of 2015-2016.

   The Funding  The amount of funding we are aiming to raise in 45 days is £1,000 in order to complete and stage ""Phaedra"" in London Camden Fringe 2015, Patras' Dansarte Centre, UnityGate in Portugal and upcoming performances in different venues internationally. As evidence from the past few months of 2015, we have spent £600 out of our pocket in making the show, rehearsing and touring. The breakdown of the potential spending, so far, is as follows: £250.00 on venue hiring / The Cockpit Theatre, £60.00 on Camden Fringe festival participation, £150.00 on rehearsal space (15hours), £150.00 on sets & props, £100.00 on flyer & posters, £100.00 (approx.) on the operator and lighting designer, £200.00 (approx.) on travel expenses to Greece and Portugal and the rest of the amount to help us in buying advertisments and press release at both festivals. 



Why Crowdfunding?
""Phaedra"" is an ambitious project to date in collaboration between Eirini Apostolatou  and Christiana Ioannou. Although, is being truly successful in both London and Greece, all the expenses were covered by us. 
To begin with, ""Phaedra"" has the possibility to become a big scale piece, due to its content that allows us to make a further development and research on its dramaturgy and kinesiology as a piece. By 'dramaturgy and kinesiology' we refer to bigger sets, more props and extensive rehearsals for research in the movement which is demanded. 
Furthermore, The Camden Fringe festival is a golden chance for us to get exposed as well as promote our performance but on the other hand is a competitive and expensive market to advertise a show. To conclude, ""Phaedra"" will be touring once again in Greece, Cyprus, Portugal, Spain and according to being successful upon application in other venues and festivals.

<p>Using actual emails from soldiers in
Iraq, news footage, the poetry of Rumi, poetry from soldiers <i>Sanctuary</i>,
a new play written and performed by theater and film actress Susanne
Sulby, will play a theatre festival circuit followed by an Off-Broadway
run. Staged by veteran Off Broadway director Stephen Stahl, the play
will intrigue theatre audiences with a poignant and touching look on the impact
of war on women over the centuries. The multi-character play features a
suburban housewife, a TV news reporter (inspired by CNN correspondent
Christiane Amanpour), and a P.O.W.  in Kosovo -- among other
characters.   Having been particularly moved by the Serbo-Croatian
conflict in the 1990‘s and the 9/11 tragedy, Sulby was inspired to write <i>Sanctuary</i> from
her relationship with television news and its ability to bring the journeys of
those surrounded by war into her home. The heart-felt stories made her question
her own various roles as a woman in these conflicts --- as the observer,
victim, mother, and wife. She watched, from the comfort of her Pennsylvania
home, a passive participant, as its horrors unfolded. “I was compelled to watch
but struggled to understand the bleak absurdity of this slaughter. Although I
was mesmerized by the news coverage, I initially felt impotent to respond. I
searched so I could find my own path to <i>sanctuary</i>, simply put
action, however small,” says Sulby.An established actor, designated Linklater
voice instructor, dialect coach and voiceover artist, Ms. Sulby has performed
for over 20 years. Favorite roles include Gertrude in Hamlet with Rev Theatre,
Aunt Bobbie in American Sligo with New City Stage Company, Yelena in <i>Black
Russian </i>with InterAct Theatre , Molly Bloom in <i>A
Dublin Bloom </i>based on James Joyce’s Ulysses , directed by Gregory
Doran of the Royal Shakespeare Company and Queen Elizabeth in <i>Richard
III</i> with Novel Stages. Her first film role was playing opposite Billy
Crudup in the 2000 award-winning Evenstar feature film, <i>Jesus’ Son</i>.
Her film credits as dialect coach include the recent feature film, <i>Silver
Linings Playbook</i> (nominated for 8 Academy Awards) directed by David O.
Russell, starring Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver.Fresh from
having penned and staged last season’s Off Broadway hit musical “Lady Day”
starring Dee Dee Bridgewater, Stephen Stahl comes to <i>Sanctuary</i> as
a seasoned writer and director. His production, directorial and industrial
credits include numerous professional stage shows, award-winning films and a
decade of writing, producing and directing the Philadelphia Music Awards. Mr. Stahl
has directed, written for, produced and worked with Billy Joel, Bill Cosby,
Patti LaBelle, Kathy Sledge, Sandy Duncan, Jason Bateman, Phyllis Hyman, Kitty

Why did I write this?<div><p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p></div>This project began for me many years ago when I was watching coverage of the conflict in serbo- croatia. As it
unfolded I was shocked and appalled that this could be happening. I couldn’t believe that after the tragedy of
the Holocaust that the world could still tolerate ‘Ethnic Cleansing.’ I couldn’t understand how this could
happen.What does it take for a group of people to decide to slaughter each other.What do the dissenters do ?
How do the women react? And of course conversely I was aware that it appeared the only way to stop this
violence was to use even greater force.Which seamed incongruous. Many years later my own life has unfolded,
I have children, I have experienced 9-11 and the following wars, I have experienced CNN,ABC,CBS,
NBC,BBC, CNBC, etc. and what seems like a constant barrage of horrors in the world. I have become
fascinated with news coverage and the question of how a reporter remains impartial. In those many years I still
had not figured out what to do to make the world a better place. I felt completely and utterly impotent. When
9-11 happened I decided I had to do something, anything. I began small, donating money or used clothing or
shoes, helping at food banks, I said yes to as many things as I could. None of these things had a direct link to
9-11. It did not matter to me. I was learning that every small thing makes a difference. I was beginning to have
faith in humanity again. I was walking toward my sanctuary. I sealed the envelope, affixed the stamp and mailed
my application to the Fringe Festival.When I did that the gears were set in motion and opportunities, allies and
teachers were put in my path. I began to believe in synchronicity again.This has been a big step. My purpose is
to say out loud, we need to do better.We can do better.We are obligated to support Iraq and rebuild and we
should be obligated to caring for our own as well.We can do both. Peace is inevitable. I will keep saying that
otherwise it will never happen. My goal is to leave the world a little better than when I found it.

<p>“American exceptionalism gone interstellar”</p>
<p><b>Giant Leap</b> is a punchy, fast-talking,
foul-mouthed comedy-drama. Set in a top-secret subterranean room, we join three

“American exceptionalism gone interstellar”
Giant Leap is a punchy, fast-talking,
foul-mouthed comedy-drama. Set in a top-secret subterranean room, we join three
writers, a secretary, a psychotic hollywood producer and a colonel as they spar
and fret over a script integral to the hoaxing of the 1969 moon ‘landing.’
This production examines the stories we tell
ourselves to justify our actions, the role of myth in a nation’s conception of
itself, and the powerful narcotic that lies in promising each individual their
own American Dream. Featuring brutally funny dialogue and starring
internationally acclaimed comedians Phil
Nichol and Tom Stade, GIANT
LEAP needs to be seen at this summer's Edinburgh Fringe.
Fresh from the recent critical and popular success of
their British Independent Film Award nominated debut feature GREGOR (www.gregormovie.com) starring Matt King (PEEP SHOW), GIANT LEAP
represents writers Mickey and Konrad’s first project for the stage -  a
unique moment in the creative life of these rising talents. 
After a spell working for the Royal Shakespeare
Company as Assistant Director on West End hit play OPPENHEIMER, GIANT LEAP will be a significant independent
production for young director Alexander Lass.

</p>
<p><b>Finding
Margo, Losing Gus</b>
draws its inspiration from the work of bestselling author John Green,
whose Young Adult novels portray teens struggling to make sense out
of life and answer the big questions – from learning to empathize
and “imagine others complexly” to dealing with tragedy and loss
and the unromantic realities of life. Green is best known for his
novel “The Fault in Our Stars,” which deals with sixteen-year-old
cancer survivors confronting their own mortality and attempting to
love and support each other with the little time they have left.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Throughout
all four of Green’s bestselling novels run the themes of love and
loss, the intricate reality of relationships, and the complex
emotions that go along with them. Finding Margo, Losing Gus
investigates these themes further, jumping into the space between the
novels to explore both the similarities between characters and the
diversity of relationships, with particular focus on the
un-romanticized reality of so-called “romantic” relationships,
and the idea that being there to support your partner in everyday
problems is sometimes more important than physical attraction.</p>

<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>To make this performance really
special, we need a larger budget.  We've got more costume pieces and
props than usual, and we've upped our publicity game with
custom-designed bookmarks handed out at local bookstores.  We're also
on a longer time frame, which means higher compensation for the
dancers.  Plus, we have an assortment of beautifully-creative
original music selections that were composed for us by a full
half-dozen independent composers – all fans of John Green's work –
and they need to be compensated for their amazing work as well.  Over three-quarters of our goal is
dedicated to performer compensation.  Once we pass the $700 mark all
of our necessary production costs will be covered, and every penny
donated past that mark goes towards our performers – the more you
donate, the more these amazing people get paid!</p>

Artistic Director, an invitation to a private rehearsal, or dinner
with the whole company!  At several reward levels you can also
receive the special honor of having officially sponsored a dancer or
fulfilled a specific production need, such as paying for our costumes
or our promotional materials.  There's something for everyone –
check them out and choose your favorite!</p>

<p>Geeksdanz’s
mission is to introduce dance to audiences that would not normally be

of emotional expression. Geeksdanz achieves this by systematically
applying the context of dance to an enormous variety of topics and
interests, and targeting performances towards the specific audiences
who share those interests.</p>
<p>In
April of 2013, we presented Challenge Mode, a concert about video
games, to an audience comprised of both dance patrons and gamers.  As
part of our mission, we presented an excerpt of Challenge Mode at
Tekkoshocon X-2, a Japanese Pop Culture convention, and Artistic
Director Ellen Deutsch led a discussion panel titled ""An
Artist's Views on the Games-As-Art Debate."" Our
second feature work, ""Up to Chance,"" was a real-time dance
interpretation of a live Dungeons and Dragons game, which we
presented at the Pittsburgh Fringe Festival in May 2014.  In
anticipation of our Halloween concert each year, we present excerpts
from our storytelling shows at the Ghost Stories concert at the Three
Rivers Storytelling Festival.  All of these
works continue our mission to introduce dance to other audiences.

<p>
</p>
<p>In
anticipation of Finding Margo, Losing Gus, we presented an excerpt at
the Carnegie Library's 2015 Summer Reading Extravaganza.  Our
performance sparked interest in our work among the reading enthusiast

<p><i>Let
It Come Down</i>
portrays the relationship between therapist and patient as a seductive love
more powerful and volatile than any romance and unmasks a doctor who attempts
to destroy her patient in order to save herself. Rachel is a vivacious yet distraught
young woman exploring her family secrets and fears about children with her
maternal therapist Marilyn. But when Marilyn faces questions in a lawsuit for
abruptly terminating Rachel’s treatment, she paints her as violent. Is Rachel
dangerous as her therapist claims? Or is the doctor hiding her own emotional
and ethical violations? Inspired by actual deposition transcripts, this
tale of betrayal ignites a dialogue about the
dynamics of therapy and the blurry line between obsession and love.<br/></p>

<p>The project
is a direct response to the vulnerabilities of at-risk young people in Broome,
promoting Indigenous culture and heritage, encouraging creativity and physical
exercise and building self-confidence.</p>
<p>We’re now
hoping to embark on our most ambitious project to date – a whole new dance
known as <b>Nyul Nyul Traditional Stories</b>.
In order to do this we need to employ a dance choreographer from Perth (circa
$4,000), secure a rehearsal studio (circa $2,000), and create new costumes
(circa $4,000). The plan is for the troupe to travel over 2,000km and perform
the dance at the Perth International Arts Festival in 2016. If we’re
successful, we hope to tour it nationally in 2017 and internationally in 2018,
and any funds we raise over the $10,000 goal will go towards making this a
reality. </p>

Robert Dann is an Indigenous Australian and Nyul Nyul man, recognised in
Australia and internationally as a dancer, choreographer and didgeridoo player.
He promotes Indigenous culture and heritage wherever he goes. Dreamtime
Dance Project workshops are open to any young people who wish to participate.
We’ve performed at more than a dozen events and over 40 students

</p><b>Why Dreamtime Dancers Is Important</b><br/><br/>A
recent survey on the social and emotional wellbeing of Indigenous young people
in the Broome region found that young women are just as vulnerable to mental
health problems as men – problems that include but are by no means limited to
suicide and suicidal ideation. As the
report concludes, the importance of fostering strong, positive and supportive
environments cannot be overstated. Robert Dann aims to develop just such an
environment in and through the Dreamtime Dancers Project.<br/><br/><p>Workshops in
contemporary Aboriginal dance are delivered on Thursday and Friday afternoons.
The workshops are free of charge and provide young people with an opportunity
to come together and dance, learn contemporary Aboriginal dance technique and
choreography, develop a repertoire of work, and perform together at events and
festivals in the Broome area. In and through that process, students are
encouraged to dance without shame (and to support each other in that), to become
aware of themselves and others as creative agents, and to see themselves as an
important part of something larger than themselves, whether that be the nascent
dance troupe or the broader community.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438836662/nnca5vgzccbwmkgg57r1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>While the
project has principally been developed and implemented for Aboriginal young
people in Broome and, even more specifically, for those whose circumstances
and/or behaviour means that they are subject to heightened levels of risk, the
workshops are open. Irrespective of culture or personal circumstance, if you
are a young person and you want to participate, you are welcome.

<p>The
underlying idea is that in and through common endeavour – in this case, a
shared practice in dance and the gradual development of career pathways –
differences can be celebrated and divisions overcome. And it is through such a
shared endeavour, and through its engagement with the broader Broome community
(through the medium of performance and the living web of mutual effort and care
that underwrites the project), that Dreamtime Dancers will foster a strong,
positive and supportive environment.</p>
<p>The direct
costs of the project are prohibitive of salaries (except in the case of
budgeted involvement from guest teachers and/choreographers) and, consequently,
the project is fuelled by the pro bono work of Robert, his sister Cecelia and
the project team, the in- kind contributions of Burdekin Youth in Action (the
importance of whose much needed assistance transporting students to an from the
workshops cannot be overestimated), and the generosity of volunteers.</p>
<p>At present,
Broome lacks a cultural dance troupe and it is anticipated that the
performances will eventually generate a small but symbolic income for the
project (to be reinvested in the project) and, in the process, will enrich the Broome
community. </p>
<p>Despite the
generosity of our patrons, the project is underfunded. There are direct costs
associated with the engagement dimension of the project, including but by no
means limited to the provision of transport to and from the workshops, adequate
support and supervision during the workshops and development of future events.</p>
<p>In terms of
student participation, the response to the project has been overwhelming.
Attendance fluctuates from week to week but the workshops are frequently
delivered to over 40 students (an attendance rate that combines both younger
and older students). In terms of enjoyment, the response is evident in the
peals of laughter during workshops, the focus that students bring to the
dances, and reports from families that their children speak with pride of their
dancing.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438836723/dnmggor6e35dyvftljzs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b><br/>Perks<br/><br/></b>

</h3> <p></p>
<p>I'm Ethan Fishbane, the writer and director of ""A Presentation by the
 People of Lake Victory for Our Leader"".  This is an expanded, full-length production that I've been 
working on for the past few years, and I am so excited to present its 15-performance run at The Gym at Judson Memorial Church here in NYC 
from July 13-August 2, 2015! This piece works to explore the interactions and lifestyle of the 
people of Lake Victory, my own vision of the last true communist state 
on earth.  Lake Victory is an imagined village where rules dominate and love is reserved for one great man who rules over all.  The show first debuted in 2014 at The Assembly at Judson Church to an extremely positive response.  With the wonderful creative playground that is Judson, we have worked to bring this show to life again in an even greater way. <br/></p>
<p>We are working with a top-notch cast and crew, but this show 
can't happen without you!</p>
<p>We need to raise money to make Lake Victory become more than just words on a page.  Aside from the ideas and the script, we need to pay for the theatre, rent 
rehearsal space, make costumes, purchase properties, assemble promotional materials, and of 
course pay our incredibly talented cast and creative team!  And the list goes on!<br/></p>With 
your assistance, we not only get to put on this show, (which I am so 
excited to share), we also get to keep asking questions about people, 
governments, and how we see the world.  You can become a part of this 
dialogue and all it takes is a small contribution!<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>We need to raise money for the theatre, costumes, set, rehearsal studio rentals, 
space rentals, properties, lights, sound, and to pay the team making this world come to life!<br/><br/>We have some really exciting 
perks that should pump you up about donating! From an exciting new poster 
designed by Denny Khurniawan (as well as the original Lake Victory artwork), to some amazing original music by Eric Namaky, to dinner and drinks!  Everyone gets to 
be a part of the fun!<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In 2013, I brought my show ""ASBA: The American Suicide Bomber 
Association"" to South Africa.  I raised funds through a similar campaign
 and was so lucky to meet my goal and tour my show to Johannesburg.  
Without the kindness and assistance of the global citizens who 
contributed along the way, I wouldn't have been able to create the 
discussion I lent way to in South Africa as I did here in NYC.  </p>
<p>Let's all be part of this conversation!<br/><br/>My
 performances are about more than the show itself.  I want to inspire 
conversation and new understanding of the world.  By donating to this 
project, you are donating to a book that is just opening.  The impact 
may not seem outwardly effective, but the impact you are making will be 
tremendous!  <br/><br/>By donating, you are sharing in this process with all of us!<br/></p>

biggest party of the year for greater Boston’s theater community for an evening
of celebration and appreciation of a year in the theater.  There are
nominees in 54 categories, recognizing the companies, directors, playwrights,
actors, designers, and choreographers who strive to keep Boston’s audiences
enthralled with vibrant, exciting and challenging theater.</p><p>See this year's nominees on our Facebook Page at this link: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=897802880242843&amp;id=351248908231579"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The 2015 IRNE Award Nominees</a>.<br/></p>

consecutive year, we insist it’s FREE to attend, no ticket required.  All are welcome to celebrate the theater
community.</span></p>
<p>The IRNE Committee is comprised of
theater critics dedicated to celebrating the extraordinary talent in Boston
Theater Community. No individual on the IRNE Committee receives any
compensation and once again we’re reaching out to friends to lend some
assistance in throwing one heck of a party.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>It’s central to our mission that
attending the IRNE Awards is free and open to all and that the whole world knows
about it.  We are generously hosted again this year by the Boston Center
for the Arts, but this year we need some additional assistance for some
logistics like chair rentals, bar set up, and sound equipment.</p>
<p>We plan to celebrate those that help
make this party happen, and this is where you come in.  All contributors
will be recognized at the party – traditionally attended by well over 500
theater artists, supporters, and friends.  Let them know you appreciate
their work, and that all their work, nominated or not, is a critical part of
Boston’s cultural landscape.</p>
<p>Make no mistake – the nominees and

appreciate them and all who strive to bring magic to the stage.  But we
all benefit from their contributions to art of theater, their talents, and
their exploration of humanity on our stages.  </p>

and all too frequently for few rewards beyond applause.<span>  The IRNE Award is a small way to celebrate
the achievements of some, but the impact of all.  Please join us in making
this celebration worthy of their work.</span></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Contributions will be dedicated to
practical things like rental of a sound system (so everyone can hear who the
winners are), an audiovisual show (so everyone can see what the nominees look
like), something to eat, places to sit and to promote what is the BIGGEST
theater awards program in New England.  </p>
<p>Contributions at any level will be
appreciated and recognized at the event.  </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We’ll confess – it’s been suggested
we just sell the tickets.  We refuse.  All are welcome.  No
ticket required.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Many in the theater community work
hard often for little or no pay, some even spend their own money on shows and
give it their all.  Whether nominated or simply wishing to applaud their

THE PLAY

A young woman, Marjorie, is attacked in her home by a would-be rapist, Raul, and manages to turn the tables on him, tying him up in her fireplace.  Threatening to set him on fire, she finds that he has been stalking her and watching her house for weeks.  Marjorie’s roommates come home to discover the attacker bound with cords, belts and other household items and imprisoned in the fireplace. Marjorie wants to kill him, thinking he will play the victim in court and will walk free to attack her another day. Terry and Patricia, the roommates, express different points of view about the assailant and rape in society. One roommate has always had faith in the justice system and wants to turn him in, and the other fears Marjorie will be will be in trouble with the law if she admits to defending herself.

But you can help, I am meant to be performing on the 22nd of January in Perth at the Fringeworld Festival with The Doorway Cabaret. But now I have no stage, no Doorway Cabaret.<br/><br/>For me to be ready to entertain and do shows on the 22nd I now have to; first find the money to rebuild, then find the people to help me rebuild. I am in Germany now and fly to Perth on the 16th. We will be arriving ready to hit the ground running, prepare for the show and start. <br/><br/>When you donate you will be helping me rebuild The Doorway Cabaret and giving me the ability to continue entertaining 1,000's of people just like you. Being a Fringe performer is not about the glamour (there is none) or making buckets of money (none of that either), it's about being able to share my work with everyone. The ""Doorway Cabaret"" is the only way for me to make money daily to cover  the expenses of being at the Fringe.<br/><br/>

<p>For the last 4 years I have been at the Perth Fringeworld Festival entertaining audiences with the ""Doorway Cabaret"". It's become a favorite and something that people are excited to see each year. The same in Adelaide. I have been supported by the crew of Gluttony at the Adelaide Fringe over the last few years.

Luckily I have some good connections in Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne.  Hopefully with these connections and people like you we will make it happen.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to get the curtain built first so that at a bare minimum I can be ready to do shows on the opening night of the Perth Fringeworld Festival (Jan.22). <br/></p>
<p>Luckily being an artist I have some artist connections and other great artists that can help. I just need to find them, and get the money to pay them for the materials and their skills.</p>

<p>Lovers of fine art are looking for something completely different―something that<br/>cannot
 be found anywhere else. Paul Vigil's unique style of performance art 
can be found only where he happens to be. He performs his original 
pieces of magic and mind reading in some of the most exclusive theaters 
in the world, and it is our mission to bring the memorable moments he 
creates to a more permanent location: a home base for Paul to further 
develop his art and a theatrical attraction that will bring in audiences
 from all over the globe.<br/></p><p>Contributors will receive items from our selection of memorabilia. The funds generated by this campaign will finance four shows at The Olympic Collection  Banquet, Conference and Entertainment Center in Los Angeles on the evenings of October 23 and 24, 2015. Performances begin at 7:30 PM &amp; 9:30 PM.</p><p>Seats will be limited to approximately 50 spots per show to ensure that everyone has an ideal vantage.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Art of <i>Legerdemain</i></b><br/></p><p>While magic is the world's oldest art form, the performance of expert, artistic magic is still very rare. There may be a lot of comedy, many “tricks,” lots of fanfare, and hype, but there is little in the way of true astonishment, especially of the kind delivered with class and style right before your eyes. Paul Vigil, who has trained with some of the great masters of the 20th century, is one of the few artists in the world who performs this scarce form of theatrical conjuring.</p><p>The art of legerdemain (French for ""lightness of hand"") is also known as ""prestidigitation."" In its modern form, this art is only about 100 years old. As a practitioner of this style, Paul invites everyone in the audience to look as closely as they can. Even if you don't have a literal front-row seat, you feel as if you do. <br/></p><p>Paul performs in front of a table, using ordinary objects, from playing cards and dice to cocktail olives and lemons, to playfully manipulate the viewers' perceptions. he can also use an assistant with a roaming camera to blast his manipulations onto large screens that can be seen from the back of the theater, if needed.</p><p>No matter the size of his audience, Paul somehow connects with each person's mind on an individual level. This is especially true when he transitions into the pure mind-reading portion of his performance. Even someone in the last row could be called upon to participate, perhaps by thinking of the contents of her purse or even a dream she's been having. Paul, despite the distance between them, can tell her exactly what her thoughts are.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Contributions for the Purposes of the

<p><b>About Two-time Merlin Award Winner Paul Vigil </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Paul
Vigil is an American magician and mentalist. He is also an inventor, writer
and lecturer, who has twice won the Merlin Award from the International Magicians Society. A specialist in
sleight of hand and perceptual manipulation, he
focuses on close-up and intimate magic and mind reading. His shows are designed to take discerning minds on a wild intellectual ride where fantasy and reality become indistinguishable. <br/></p>
<p>Magic's cognoscenti have awarded “Magic Trick of the Year"" to Paul numerous times. One such effect, ""The Ladybug"" was recently performed by Penn &amp; Teller on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon. Paul's recent book on theatrical magic, <i>Classic Fantastic</i>, which was limited to 500
copies, virtually sold out the moment it was offered to the magic community.<br/></p>
<p>Paul
first discovered the magical arts when he was around six years
old. Strolling around the local library, he stumbled upon <i>Greater Magic</i> by John Northern Hilliard, a tome that featured the magic of some of the greatest artists of the  1920s and 30s. During his ten years behind the counter as a demonstrator at Showplace Magic he gained a scholarly knowledge
of classical magic and honed his performing chops. <br/></p>
<p>Paul would go on to study with some of the 20th century's greatest magical thinkers, including Johnny Thompson, Channing Pollock, and Eugene Burger.<br/></p>
<p>For several years, Paul performed his evening show at The Mirage Hotel &amp; Casino to rave reviews:</p>
<p><b>""… Better than even Copperfield… In fact, were we feeling hyperbolic, we’d go all out and say this was the least cheesy, most mystifying, and definitely the most satisfying magic experience that we have had in Vegas. </b></p>

</div></div>","Our Mission
Lovers of fine art are looking for something completely different―something thatcannot
 be found anywhere else. Paul Vigil's unique style of performance art 
can be found only where he happens to be. He performs his original 
pieces of magic and mind reading in some of the most exclusive theaters 
in the world, and it is our mission to bring the memorable moments he 
creates to a more permanent location: a home base for Paul to further 
develop his art and a theatrical attraction that will bring in audiences
 from all over the globe.Contributors will receive items from our selection of memorabilia. The funds generated by this campaign will finance four shows at The Olympic Collection  Banquet, Conference and Entertainment Center in Los Angeles on the evenings of October 23 and 24, 2015. Performances begin at 7:30 PM & 9:30 PM.Seats will be limited to approximately 50 spots per show to ensure that everyone has an ideal vantage.The Art of LegerdemainWhile magic is the world's oldest art form, the performance of expert, artistic magic is still very rare. There may be a lot of comedy, many “tricks,” lots of fanfare, and hype, but there is little in the way of true astonishment, especially of the kind delivered with class and style right before your eyes. Paul Vigil, who has trained with some of the great masters of the 20th century, is one of the few artists in the world who performs this scarce form of theatrical conjuring.The art of legerdemain (French for ""lightness of hand"") is also known as ""prestidigitation."" In its modern form, this art is only about 100 years old. As a practitioner of this style, Paul invites everyone in the audience to look as closely as they can. Even if you don't have a literal front-row seat, you feel as if you do. Paul performs in front of a table, using ordinary objects, from playing cards and dice to cocktail olives and lemons, to playfully manipulate the viewers' perceptions. he can also use an assistant with a roaming camera to blast his manipulations onto large screens that can be seen from the back of the theater, if needed.No matter the size of his audience, Paul somehow connects with each person's mind on an individual level. This is especially true when he transitions into the pure mind-reading portion of his performance. Even someone in the last row could be called upon to participate, perhaps by thinking of the contents of her purse or even a dream she's been having. Paul, despite the distance between them, can tell her exactly what her thoughts are.Contributions for the Purposes of the

About Two-time Merlin Award Winner Paul Vigil 

Paul
Vigil is an American magician and mentalist. He is also an inventor, writer
and lecturer, who has twice won the Merlin Award from the International Magicians Society. A specialist in
sleight of hand and perceptual manipulation, he
focuses on close-up and intimate magic and mind reading. His shows are designed to take discerning minds on a wild intellectual ride where fantasy and reality become indistinguishable. 
Magic's cognoscenti have awarded “Magic Trick of the Year"" to Paul numerous times. One such effect, ""The Ladybug"" was recently performed by Penn & Teller on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon. Paul's recent book on theatrical magic, Classic Fantastic, which was limited to 500
copies, virtually sold out the moment it was offered to the magic community.
Paul
first discovered the magical arts when he was around six years
old. Strolling around the local library, he stumbled upon Greater Magic by John Northern Hilliard, a tome that featured the magic of some of the greatest artists of the  1920s and 30s. During his ten years behind the counter as a demonstrator at Showplace Magic he gained a scholarly knowledge
of classical magic and honed his performing chops. 
Paul would go on to study with some of the 20th century's greatest magical thinkers, including Johnny Thompson, Channing Pollock, and Eugene Burger.
For several years, Paul performed his evening show at The Mirage Hotel & Casino to rave reviews:
""… Better than even Copperfield… In fact, were we feeling hyperbolic, we’d go all out and say this was the least cheesy, most mystifying, and definitely the most satisfying magic experience that we have had in Vegas. 
""We’re going to re-introduce you to the finest entertainment deal on the strip. Paul Vigil performs only one hour a week, to a very limited audience . . . It's still the best hour of mystery you’ll see on your trip.""
- Vegas Chatter


""If you love illusion, magic, mystery and just enjoy witnessing amazing feats of mysticism, go see Paul."" 
- Yelp (5 Stars)


""Paul Vigil is one of the most engaging, original, and provocative close-up performers of the 21st century.""
- Johnny Thompson, aka The Great Tomsoni


""Paul Vigil is soft-spoken and humble, but behind that compelling demeanor is a diabolical mind. He is one of the best magicians working today!""
 ― Lance Burton, Master Magician




""I have been around magic and great magicians all my life. I can appreciate and respect good magic. I can be amused. I can be compelled. But I have never before been completely blown away . . . Paul Vigil blew me away.""

<h3><i>Story</i></h3>
<p>The performance tackles female genital mutilation (FGM) and its effect on women who are suffering as a result of this practise.</p>
<p>The project is aimed at the mainstream theatre audience and local urban communities to expose the issue and bring support to the victims.</p>
<p>The plot focuses on Cleo, a young woman in London who has been living with type 3 female genital mutilation since she was 7. Scarred by her husband in a brutal sexual assault, she finds the strength to seek a reversal surgery at the African Women’s Health Clinic in London. Her family oppose the decision and send her to stay with her aunt Winnie in an attempt to force FGM as a “gift”. On the journey of healing she meets Eve, a fellow victim who is instantly drawn to her.</p>

<h3>WHY THE BIG EVENT?</h3>
<p>Because three plays about politics, drugs, Elvis, Nixon, Coca Cola, the Watergate break-in, the JFK assassination and football should be seen all at once. Well, maybe it's not necessary but it sure is a cool and sexy thing to pull off.  It will be an huge treat for those brave souls who dare to see all three shows. It's not vital to see them all, as each stands on their own, but these plays work very well together and those who see more than one will be rewarded by the connections. Christian Levatino's writing and characters are rich and extremely satisfying. Plus, you will learn something about three seminal moments in American history. </p>

<p>This is a process that started five years ago at the 2013 Hollywood Fringe Festival. <strong>SUNNY AFTERNOON</strong> was performed 12 times in a workshop production. It went through many edits during those 12 performances. Like the bionic man, it grew stronger.

It was very successful and received much critical praise for its writing, directing and acting.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Nine years ago I began my journey as a Kathak teacher - taking an ancient art form that I had been practicing for over two decades, and passing it on to the next generation of Indian-Americans. They were only six or seven years of age, and out of the dozens that I taught, these five remained true to their commitment of the art form. </p>
<p>Antara Asthaayi Dance proudly presents its first generation of Kathak dancers - featuring the debut performances of five extraordinary dancers who embark on their first milestone performance in a lifetime of learning, performing, and eventually teaching. </p>
<p>An art form that was once traditionally passed down through the patriarchy from father-to-son, now is predominantly upheld and preserved by women. A dance form that was once outlawed in India by the British, now thrives 10,000 miles away here in the United States. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>In order to realize this dream, we are reaching out to our amazing community of artists and dance lovers across the globe to help generate the necessary funds for Anokhi Ada. Most people are unaware that ticket sales only comprise of 10-20% of the cost of putting on a show like this. </p>
<p>Antara Asthaayi Dance needs to raise $5,000 to help with production costs as we present at the prestigious Mountain View Center of Performing Arts - right in the heart of Silicon Valley, home of Google! This includes hiring a professional lighting designer, a sound technician, production manager, and stage hands to help load &amp; unload all our equipment. </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Tutorials, postcards, jewellery, tickets, our eternal thanks, free hugs, and more!!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""Anokhi Ada"" is the debut performance of a new generation of Kathak artists, trained by Antara Bhardwaj, disciple of Pandit Chitresh Das. Your contribution helps directly in preserving this art form, so that the next generation can pass this on with integrity to the future generations. The work we present in this one evening is 9 years in the making - and your support will help bring this to the stage - just as this art form was meant to be shared. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Nine years ago I began my journey as a Kathak teacher - taking an ancient art form that I had been practicing for over two decades, and passing it on to the next generation of Indian-Americans. They were only six or seven years of age, and out of the dozens that I taught, these five remained true to their commitment of the art form. 
Antara Asthaayi Dance proudly presents its first generation of Kathak dancers - featuring the debut performances of five extraordinary dancers who embark on their first milestone performance in a lifetime of learning, performing, and eventually teaching. 
An art form that was once traditionally passed down through the patriarchy from father-to-son, now is predominantly upheld and preserved by women. A dance form that was once outlawed in India by the British, now thrives 10,000 miles away here in the United States. 

What We Need
In order to realize this dream, we are reaching out to our amazing community of artists and dance lovers across the globe to help generate the necessary funds for Anokhi Ada. Most people are unaware that ticket sales only comprise of 10-20% of the cost of putting on a show like this. 
Antara Asthaayi Dance needs to raise $5,000 to help with production costs as we present at the prestigious Mountain View Center of Performing Arts - right in the heart of Silicon Valley, home of Google! This includes hiring a professional lighting designer, a sound technician, production manager, and stage hands to help load & unload all our equipment. 
What You Get
Tutorials, postcards, jewellery, tickets, our eternal thanks, free hugs, and more!!
 

The Impact
""Anokhi Ada"" is the debut performance of a new generation of Kathak artists, trained by Antara Bhardwaj, disciple of Pandit Chitresh Das. Your contribution helps directly in preserving this art form, so that the next generation can pass this on with integrity to the future generations. The work we present in this one evening is 9 years in the making - and your support will help bring this to the stage - just as this art form was meant to be shared.

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Avinoam Silverman.  I am presently a freelance choreographer and ballet teacher and a former National Ballet of Canada soloist.  I am excited to tell you about “Waiting for the Fall” a new dance creation for my company.   This new work is multifaceted.   The original idea first came to me from an allegory I encountered in a book describing a leaf falling down from a tree and suggesting how beautiful and simple the leaf is in “being” itself completely. The author compares this falling leaf to human beings who all too often do not see the simplicity of ‘just being’ in themselves.  </p>
<p>This idea opened up a lot of questions in my mind about what it means to be human, and how can we find peace in all this complexity?   A year ago I suffered a great loss of a very dear person in my life.  I was devastated and it took me a long time to come to terms with this great loss.  In this new work l explore the ways we confront the loss of people we love and possible ways to move forward from it.  </p>
<p>This work will also explore how our close relationships affect us as we grow up, and contribute to whom we become as adults.   This theme will focus mainly on selected interpersonal episodes that took place in my nuclear family. This theme will be addressed by a collage of some decisive situations and moments from my life that had a considerable impact on me as a child. Moments of dance in its purest form as an expression of joy and freedom will be intertwined into this collage.   </p>
<p>I approach this work in ways through which to articulate that movement in life isn't always linear.   As adults we sometimes go back in time and analyze certain moments and situations that happened to us as children that still have an emotional hold on us today.  This process helps us bring more clarity to our inner emotional state and ultimately frees us from our past.  It allows us to create the story that we choose for our life.    </p>
<p>The main underlying theme in this work is this journey of examining our past, seeing it clearly, and then moving into freedom with limitless possibilities.   Although this work is deeply personal it's themes are very universal. It's a work about all of us. It’s about hardships and how we fall while choosing  to get back up – sometimes, against all odds.  By supporting this project you will help us bring this work to life from an idea to concrete physical reality. We can’t do it without you!  Please help us make this happen. We will be forever grateful to you.</p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p> Both in 2015 (Diversion dance film)  and 2017 (A full evening of dance) I used Indiegogo in order to fund these projects . Both of the campaigns were successful thanks to the generosity of all our backers. We truly couldn't have done it without them!  All our hard work paid off and we were able to complete our projects with all expenses covered.  Now the dance film exists and we can share it with everyone.  It also was accepted into several film festivals. Here is the link: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poiiapWKc8E"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poiiapWKc8E</a>,   Anvil 18 and Shedding Eve the works I created for the full evening in 2017 went on to be performed in Dance Ontario Weekend and in Spotlight on Israeli Culture Festival.</p>
<p>This time around we are preparing another live evening for the stage.  I am excited to venture into a work that is deeply personal yet very universal where people can relate it to their story and come out of the show with a fresh perspective on their own life.  This work will offer an opportunity to look deeper into the intricacy and majesty of life to explore the complex nature of our relationships  and the wide spectrum of our emotions in an artistic and creative way.   Hopefully it will lend a fresh perspective on how we can learn from the past in order to move forward with more freedom into new paths.   Your help will bring to life an exciting evening of dance.</p>
<p>We would be most grateful for your support.</p>

<p>As we are living in uncertain times due to the Covid-19 pandemic as we move forward with the rehearsals for this project there is a chance we might have to change the dates around according to the situation at hand both for rehearsals and the shows.  Yes,  Covid-19 could create more challenges on the way but we believe there  is nothing like a live performance and we are looking forward to sharing it with people! We will take all the necessary precautions on the way,  Our priority is peoples safety first!   If it does turn out to be the case that there are safety protocols in place that force us to postpone our shows we will do so and reschedule the dates to when it is safe again.   But you can be rest assured the shows will take place when it is safe to do so!</p>

<p><strong>To Our Community:</strong></p>
<p>After a three-year development process, Dohee Lee Puri Arts is months away from premiering our new performance, MU/巫: 9 Goddesses, May 21-23 @ Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco, after which we’ll head to REDCAT, LA and then EastSide Cultural Center, Oakland in the Fall.</p>
<p>We have been granted $13,000 by the East Bay Community Foundation to support the completion of MU/巫 – rehearsing, building the set, paying artists’ fees, community participation fees, Puri Arts administration and more.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch! East Bay Community Foundation will only give us the $13,000 if we can match it dollar-for-dollar in donations.</p>
<p>Raising these funds are essential for us to premiere and tour MU/巫 and to keep Puri Arts thriving into the future. If we cannot raise these funds, we may not be able to finish the performance and we’re facing the possibility that Puri Arts may cease to exist. At this moment, everything depends upon our ability to pay the artists to make this performance.</p>
<p>We believe that art is integral to the fabric of society and that we can transform people’s lives through art. As artists, we serve as vessels for people to discover and connect to their roots. We dedicate our lives to this vision. We are reaching out to you, our community, because we believe the work that Dohee is doing on the stage and in the community is vitally important. More than ever, the voices and actions of artists are needed. However, less resources than ever are available to support artists’ work. So, as in traditional times, we turn to our urban village to seek the resources to keep teaching and making work for the community. Without this support, we cannot keep doing our work.</p>
<p>The good news is, not only do you get a tax write off for your donation (via our fiscal sponsor, Dancers’ Group) but also, every dollar you are able to give will be doubled. At this moment, even a small donation will have an outsized impact.</p>
<p>One of the ways you can support our work is by pre-purchasing a new collection of music by Dohee Lee and Adria Otte, which will be released at the MU/巫 premiere in May. If that’s something you might have purchased anyway, this is a moment where that money can be DOUBLED and make a big difference in sustaining the very existence of Dohee Lee Puri Arts.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are some rare and valuable experiences (check out the “perks”) that Dohee is humbly offering at higher levels of donation. <br/><br/>Stay tuned for more project updates soon and thank you so much for your support!  </p>

<p>BECOME A PATRON OF OPS FEST</p>
<p>Please support our efforts by making a monetary gift to WIL Festival. Our performers step into the shoes of 16th century professionals and walk miles in them all summer long, discovering how Original Practice succeeds in the 21st century.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to give, check out the sidebar to the right of your screen and find a level of giving that matches your means and your corresponding gift. If you want to learn more, read below!</p>
<p>HOW YOU CAN GIVE...</p>
<p>Our shows are always admission free. To pay our bills and our actors in this year's WIL Festival will cost approximately $2,500! We need your help to make that happen!</p>
<p>Help us raise $2,500 - a substantial portion of our operating budget, symbolic of mounting the WIL Festival!</p>
<p>Of course we don't expect all our supporters to be substantial contributors. When you join us in the park, we'll ask you to drop a small contribution into a post-show bucket (our version of passing the hat), and if you are able to give more than spare change or cash on hand, we gladly accept a check or credit card on site. THANK YOU to everyone who has given and continues to give. We simply cannot do it without you.</p>
<p>...AND WHAT YOU WILL GET</p>
<p>Patrons of Shakespeare's company were known to favor individual actors, sometimes directly supporting them with personal tips or gifts or voting with their wallets in other ways: expanding an actor's wardrobe, perhaps in turn helping him win larger, more impressive roles.</p>
<p>We've taken some inspiration from the older economic structure in designing your perks:</p>
<p>SPONSOR AN ACTOR and you have the option to have a creative exchange over a role, perhaps inspiring the kind of character, costume, or behaviors you'll see on stage.</p>
<p>BUSINESS OWNER? Shakespeare's plays are notoriously referential - his audience was used to hearing jabs at rival playwrights, shout outs to favorite taverns, or send ups of contemporary political figures.</p>
<p>FIND A LEVEL OF SUPPORT THAT WORKS FOR YOU! (See the full list of perks and levels of giving to the right.)</p>
<p>YOUR IMPACT</p>
<p>Many of our performers have begun to master the combination of text analysis, vocal and physical athleticism, and improvisation skills that cue script performance demands. Through a combination of training and rigorous experience, impossible to recreate without a viable company.</p>
<p>With the help of Ronni Lacroute, as well as The Swinford Family Foundation, Starseed Foundation, and Many Horses Productions, we've been able to hire professional actors at competitive rates and find a home in the local theatre community.</p>
<p>We keep costs low so we can expand the reach of our season into more neighborhoods. Relative to the modern tradition of massive set construction and architectural verisimilitude, our universal set is lightweight, compact, and reusable. Our tents, costumes, weapons, and minimal properties are available on-location via our spectacular trailer, so we are able travel the Portland metro area and beyond!</p>
<p>We need you! This Indegogo campaign must earn $2,500. If you can help us meet our goal, we’ll be on track for next summer's festival, able to recruit and retain experienced actors, and staffing 12-hour production marathons. Come see for yourself why folks of all ages make our seasons an integral part of their summer!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.tosinger.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tosinger</a>. I am a Singer/Storyteller/Actress who creates and promotes African art, music and culture through events and concerts which contributes immensely to cultural knowledge and entertainment in the Americas. Currently in pre-production stage is an African theatrical one woman musical in collaboration with world renowned Cameroonian Guitarist, <a href=""http://www.franckbiyong.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Franck Biyong</a>, from Paris as the music composer and arranger. This project will be taking place in the summer (June/July) and/or fall (Oct/Nov) of 2019 touring two cities – New York and Atlanta respectively and other cities based on request.</p>
<p>It is obvious that more people are being sensitized to the diversity and relevance of the continent of Africa especially since the release of the Black Panther movie, there has been a growing admiration of the aesthetics of the arts, music and culture of Africa.  Although it's a fictional movie, some reality topics were insinuated but not distinctly addressed.  This project aims to use the art of authentic oral theatrical African storytelling to sonically and dramatically trigger and evoke emotions to confront the elephant in the room, it will address deep issues that come from a place of misinformation and ignorance; using stories and music to draw from the past to affect the present about the relationship between African immigrants and African Americans and the black diaspora.</p>
<p>This one-hour stage production performance through monologue, devising collaborations, singing and live band musicians on an aesthetically appropriate stage. It will also be on a recorded format for entertainment, educational and informational purposes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We <i>(my team and I)</i> need some head start financially to kick this off the ground that is why we’re cordially inviting you to partner with us to make this a reality by becoming a contributor.  Our needs include Venue fees, Sound and Light System, Musicians, Music production, travel and accommodation, Rehearsal space, Costumes, Stage and Tech Professionals, Photography and Videography, Advertising, Media and Marketing personnel; Hospitality, Food and Beverage; Graphic Design and Printing. We realize how important our sponsors are to an event's success that is why we have made the benefit options simple and value worthy, which include marketing exposure for your business, product or service in our event brochure and if you are an individual, there are awesome perks as can be seen on the right hand side for different levels and of course our heartfelt expression of gratitude through recognition.</p>
</div><div>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
My name is Tosinger. I am a Singer/Storyteller/Actress who creates and promotes African art, music and culture through events and concerts which contributes immensely to cultural knowledge and entertainment in the Americas. Currently in pre-production stage is an African theatrical one woman musical in collaboration with world renowned Cameroonian Guitarist, Franck Biyong, from Paris as the music composer and arranger. This project will be taking place in the summer (June/July) and/or fall (Oct/Nov) of 2019 touring two cities – New York and Atlanta respectively and other cities based on request.
It is obvious that more people are being sensitized to the diversity and relevance of the continent of Africa especially since the release of the Black Panther movie, there has been a growing admiration of the aesthetics of the arts, music and culture of Africa.  Although it's a fictional movie, some reality topics were insinuated but not distinctly addressed.  This project aims to use the art of authentic oral theatrical African storytelling to sonically and dramatically trigger and evoke emotions to confront the elephant in the room, it will address deep issues that come from a place of misinformation and ignorance; using stories and music to draw from the past to affect the present about the relationship between African immigrants and African Americans and the black diaspora.
This one-hour stage production performance through monologue, devising collaborations, singing and live band musicians on an aesthetically appropriate stage. It will also be on a recorded format for entertainment, educational and informational purposes.

<h3>Dads Dancing? What's the Big Whoop?</h3>
<p>Oh really? You must be formally trained. Well, we're not. We're just four dads dancing like nobody's watching! I guess we're hoping to change that so when we dance, everyone's watching! Or, at least more dads are dancing!</p>
<p>We like to think of our ""style"" as a blend of improvisational and inspirational! Paired with some fresh beats, it's quite the combination. And, we hope that you'll catch the vision and help us raise money for some pretty remarkable organizations. </p>

<h3>What This Is All About</h3>
<p>F.R.E.E. International &amp; Water Wells for Africa are just two of the organizations that we're focusing on raising funds for. A little more about them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>F.R.E.E International</strong> is <i>working to abolish sex and labor trafficking primarily in the U.S. with innovative collaborations through public and private partnerships. (<a href=""http://freeinternational.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">more info</a>)</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Water Wells for Africa </strong>installs water wells in the rural African villages and <i>promotes community development by providing sustainable water sources and reducing health risks associated with contaminated water. (<a href=""https://waterwellsforafrica.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">more info</a>)</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">People should not have to live under such opression, and should have access to some of their most basic needs being met to live life where they're at. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We can help by making sure we're doing our part in our communities, but there are such simple ways we can help encourage organizations like these to continue with their mission of freedom and empowerment. Consider donating.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Your Donations + More MA$KDAD$ = Meaningful Change!</h3>
<p> Any donation you're willing to make will go towards helping two very important causes. Plus, Indiegogo makes it very easy to contribute.  So, consider: </p>
<ul>
<li>Converting one of your daily lattes, or scones, to a contribution towards the MaskDads campaign. </li>
<li>Contributing $2, $3, $5, $25... heck, how about $500? Your generosity will help in a big way and we'll continue to put out content that will inspire all generations! Sounds dramatic, but our dancing is dramatic! Also, be sure to follow us at our social channels to keep updated on what we're up to. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><strong>Tell others about us! Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. </strong>Maybe you can't contribute financially. That's okay! Just help us spread the word like wildfire!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your part in supporting these life changing organizations. And, for giving a few dads a reason to cut a serious rug!</p>

F.R.E.E. International & Water Wells for Africa are just two of the organizations that we're focusing on raising funds for. A little more about them:


F.R.E.E International is working to abolish sex and labor trafficking primarily in the U.S. with innovative collaborations through public and private partnerships. (more info)


Water Wells for Africa installs water wells in the rural African villages and promotes community development by providing sustainable water sources and reducing health risks associated with contaminated water. (more info)


People should not have to live under such opression, and should have access to some of their most basic needs being met to live life where they're at. 
We can help by making sure we're doing our part in our communities, but there are such simple ways we can help encourage organizations like these to continue with their mission of freedom and empowerment. Consider donating.
 
Your Donations + More MA$KDAD$ = Meaningful Change!
 Any donation you're willing to make will go towards helping two very important causes. Plus, Indiegogo makes it very easy to contribute.  So, consider: 

Converting one of your daily lattes, or scones, to a contribution towards the MaskDads campaign. 
Contributing $2, $3, $5, $25... heck, how about $500? Your generosity will help in a big way and we'll continue to put out content that will inspire all generations! Sounds dramatic, but our dancing is dramatic! Also, be sure to follow us at our social channels to keep updated on what we're up to. 

 

 
Other Ways You Can Help
Tell others about us! Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Maybe you can't contribute financially. That's okay! Just help us spread the word like wildfire!
Thank you so much for your part in supporting these life changing organizations. And, for giving a few dads a reason to cut a serious rug!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><br/></p>
<h3>About EagerRisk Theater<br/>
</h3>
<p>As R. Admiral Grace Hooper famously said, ""A ship in port is safe, but<br/>that is not what ships are built for."" Eager Risk Theater, a New York-based<br/>company founded by three alumni from the Ira Brind School of Theater<br/>Arts at the University of the Arts, applies this motto in every venture,<br/>proving in theatre, there is no ruin among the risky. Headed by Artistic<br/>Director and actor/playwright Annie R. Such, Eager Risk Theater dedicates<br/>itself to producing and supporting young, eager, and risky theatre.<br/>Committing itself to predominately new, original work, and rich, rare<br/>revivals, Eager Risk Productions cultivates the artist as well as the art by<br/>incorporating multiple medias with live performance. With cultural and<br/>thematic specific seasons, Eager Risk Theater integrates each program<br/>with a different visual art movement or artist, exemplifying the theatrical<br/>components and educating audiences with poignancy and truth. Eager<br/>Risk Theater seeks to find beauty in not only the winsome, but also the<br/>grotesque aspects of human nature, by challenging conventional<br/>aesthetics with the highest form of new, inventive theater.<br/></p>
<p>Eager Risk Theater formed in 2012 as the YeuxVeuxBelle Collective,<br/>producing their first collaborative, multi-media play The Artists’ Women in<br/>the Philadelphia Fringe Festival. Under the guidance of<br/>Producer/Marketing Director Jarrod Markman, and after receiving the Ira<br/>Brind Alumni Grant, The Artists’ Women opened to mass acclaim, and<br/>sold-out shows for the entirety of the run. Reviewer Alaina Mabasco said<br/>of the production, “The cast brims with as much physical and emotional<br/>passion as the script. Such packs the play with sensual imagery and ripe,<br/>time-honored artistic dilemmas, and she also contributes a digital<br/>slideshow, projected on the set’s backdrop, which peppers the stage with<br/>images of the characters’ most famous art. The artists’ women suffer the<br/>sublime pain of coming second to their lovers’ genius, or watching their<br/>own talents consumed by a male-dominated world, where they’ll be<br/>remembered by history not for what they did, but for who they loved….<br/>This new acquaintance with the artists, their long-suffering lovers, and the<br/>imagined muse behind it all will leave you wanting to revisit the<br/>masterpieces themselves.”<br/></p>
<p>Since 2012, Eager Risk Theater has continued to create dialogue among<br/>theatre-goers, with successful productions of My Generation Festival, a<br/>series of short plays commenting on the Millennial Generation from the<br/>perspectives of both Generation Y playwrights and Generation X/Baby<br/>Boomer playwrights, Down With Love, a Valentine’s Cabaret, showcasing<br/>the young talent of Philadelphia, and Crumble: Lay Me Down Justin<br/>Timberlake by Sheila Callaghan, Eager Risk Theater’s NYC Debut!<br/>The 2015/2016 season marks Eager Risk Theater’s inaugural full season in<br/>NYC, and  will involve collaborations with other small companies!<br/>The Season of Magical Realism will integrate conceptual design inspired<br/>by Joseph Cornell, and is organized to be self-sustaining for an entire year.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>EagerRisk marries all art forms together!</h3>
<p>Each Season is inspired by an artist or art Movement, marrying concepts and principles into theatrical direction and design, expanding audiences appreciation of not only live performance, but also fine art. Learn more about This Season's Inspiration, Joseph Cornell:</p>
<p>Joseph Cornell (December 24, 1903 – December 29, 1972) was<br/>an American artist and sculptor, one of the pioneers and most celebrated<br/>exponents of assemblage. Influenced by the Surrealists, he was also<br/>an avant-garde experimental filmmaker.</p>
<p>Cornell's most characteristic art works were boxed assemblages created<br/>from found objects. These are simple shadow boxes, usually fronted with a<br/>glass pane, in which he arranged eclectic fragments of photographs<br/>or Victorian bric a brac, in a way that combines the formal austerity<br/>of Constructivism with the lively fantasy of Surrealism.

About EagerRisk Theater

As R. Admiral Grace Hooper famously said, ""A ship in port is safe, butthat is not what ships are built for."" Eager Risk Theater, a New York-basedcompany founded by three alumni from the Ira Brind School of TheaterArts at the University of the Arts, applies this motto in every venture,proving in theatre, there is no ruin among the risky. Headed by ArtisticDirector and actor/playwright Annie R. Such, Eager Risk Theater dedicatesitself to producing and supporting young, eager, and risky theatre.Committing itself to predominately new, original work, and rich, rarerevivals, Eager Risk Productions cultivates the artist as well as the art byincorporating multiple medias with live performance. With cultural andthematic specific seasons, Eager Risk Theater integrates each programwith a different visual art movement or artist, exemplifying the theatricalcomponents and educating audiences with poignancy and truth. EagerRisk Theater seeks to find beauty in not only the winsome, but also thegrotesque aspects of human nature, by challenging conventionalaesthetics with the highest form of new, inventive theater.
Eager Risk Theater formed in 2012 as the YeuxVeuxBelle Collective,producing their first collaborative, multi-media play The Artists’ Women inthe Philadelphia Fringe Festival. Under the guidance ofProducer/Marketing Director Jarrod Markman, and after receiving the IraBrind Alumni Grant, The Artists’ Women opened to mass acclaim, andsold-out shows for the entirety of the run. Reviewer Alaina Mabasco saidof the production, “The cast brims with as much physical and emotionalpassion as the script. Such packs the play with sensual imagery and ripe,time-honored artistic dilemmas, and she also contributes a digitalslideshow, projected on the set’s backdrop, which peppers the stage withimages of the characters’ most famous art. The artists’ women suffer thesublime pain of coming second to their lovers’ genius, or watching theirown talents consumed by a male-dominated world, where they’ll beremembered by history not for what they did, but for who they loved….This new acquaintance with the artists, their long-suffering lovers, and theimagined muse behind it all will leave you wanting to revisit themasterpieces themselves.”
Since 2012, Eager Risk Theater has continued to create dialogue amongtheatre-goers, with successful productions of My Generation Festival, aseries of short plays commenting on the Millennial Generation from theperspectives of both Generation Y playwrights and Generation X/BabyBoomer playwrights, Down With Love, a Valentine’s Cabaret, showcasingthe young talent of Philadelphia, and Crumble: Lay Me Down JustinTimberlake by Sheila Callaghan, Eager Risk Theater’s NYC Debut!The 2015/2016 season marks Eager Risk Theater’s inaugural full season inNYC, and  will involve collaborations with other small companies!The Season of Magical Realism will integrate conceptual design inspiredby Joseph Cornell, and is organized to be self-sustaining for an entire year.


EagerRisk marries all art forms together!
Each Season is inspired by an artist or art Movement, marrying concepts and principles into theatrical direction and design, expanding audiences appreciation of not only live performance, but also fine art. Learn more about This Season's Inspiration, Joseph Cornell:
Joseph Cornell (December 24, 1903 – December 29, 1972) wasan American artist and sculptor, one of the pioneers and most celebratedexponents of assemblage. Influenced by the Surrealists, he was alsoan avant-garde experimental filmmaker.
Cornell's most characteristic art works were boxed assemblages createdfrom found objects. These are simple shadow boxes, usually fronted with aglass pane, in which he arranged eclectic fragments of photographsor Victorian bric a brac, in a way that combines the formal austerityof Constructivism with the lively fantasy of Surrealism. Many of his boxes,such as the famous Medici Slot Machine boxes, are interactive and aremeant to be handled.
Cornell often made series of boxed assemblages that reflected his variousinterests: the Soap Bubble Sets, the Medici Slot Machine series, the PinkPalace series, the Hotel series, the Observatory series, and the SpaceObject Boxes, among others. Also captivated with birds, Cornell createdan Aviary series of boxes, in which colorful images of various birds weremounted on wood, cut out, and set against harsh white backgrounds.[2]In addition to creating boxes and flat collages and making short art films,Cornell also kept a filing system of over 160 visual-documentary ""dossiers""on themes that interested him; the dossiers served as repositories fromwhich Cornell drew material and inspiration for boxes like his ""pennyarcade"" portrait of Lauren Bacall. He had no formal training in art,although he was extremely well-read and was conversant with the NewYork art scene from the 1940s through to the 1960s.

</div><p> </p><h3>The My True Colors Festival Presents:</h3>
<p>America, and the Adventures of Nat Turn-Up!

</p><h3>Short Summary</h3>Nat Turn-Up, is an 18 year old rapper from Brooklyn, New York. After a taste of the
 ills of America's justice system, via the lens of a short stay in a 
juvenile detention center, he returns home to his community of family 
and friends on a mission. He is determined to become a 
revolutionary. To uplift and resurrect the minds of his people. Nat, 
along with his community are all fighting for their right to be heard, 
to be seen, to discover who they are and thrive in a world that both at 
times covertly and overtly oppresses them from being able to bask in the
 freedom which they all seek. As Gil Scott Heron once so poignantly said
 ""Who Will Survive in America?"" The characters in this play all ask this
 same question. What will it take to truly be free? Is it possible, and 
for who?<br/><br/><div>
<h3>What We Need 
<ul>
<li>""America, and The Adventures of Nat Turn-Up!"" is in the early stages
 of it's development. In the past I've jumped right into production mode
 but this time I want to take the time to really flesh this piece out 
because I believe it to be both powerful and special. It's extremely 
personal to me. Therefore, my goal is to produce a week and a half long 
developmental workshop that will culminate in 2-3 performances of the 
play being presented as a staged reading at The Faison Firehouse Theatre
 in Harlem, N.Y. this summer.</li>
<li>Everything we raise will be going right into making this Staged Reading/Developmental workshop a success.</li>
<li>Your very generous donations will contribute to things such as 
allowing us to secure a rehearsal space, acquire rehearsal materials, 
provide transportation funds &amp; compensation for an extremely gifted 
and dope creative team, among other costs that may arise in the process 
of putting this project on it's feet. </li>
</ul> </h3>
<p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>I was born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y. The same borough that this 
play takes place in. It is really important to me to see my community 
reflected not only in the media, but on stage. I've always been very 
inspired by what August Wilson did in depicting the lives and stories of
 African American people in Pittsburgh, PA in his ten play cycle which 
spanned over the course of the twentieth century. My goal is to do 
something similar for Brooklyn. This play is to be the first part of a 
much longer cycle, giving voice to people and a community that often 
goes misrepresented and unheard. I too want to leave a legacy that 
honors those from which I come from and also delves into the 
complexities of our existence. I want my people to feel seen. I think 
that it's important for art to speak. To bring about social and 
revolutionary change. I want this play to inspire people to mobilize. To
 awaken and unite. I want my community to rise above the system that 
attempts to silence them, heal and feel empowered to reclaim the glory 
and royalty that has always been running through our veins. For any of 
these things to happen, it is essential that this developmental process 
has all of the tools that it needs. This is where you come in. : ) I 
really hope that you will consider donating to this project today.</li></ul>

<p>Hi there! Firstly I want to thank you for your
interest in our campaign! I am Anna Carfora and I am running this campaign so
that I can get my show “Circular – Strada Circolare” (a play I wrote myself a
few years back) on the road towards this year’s Edinburgh Fringe Festival. I am a performer, and I am also producing this show. I
have studied drama and worked as an actress for the past 10 years in Italy,
Milano (that’s where I am from). In 2012 I performed at the Edinburgh Fringe,
and I fell in love with this country, this arts system and the whole atmosphere
of the Festival. Therefore I decided to attend an MA in Ensemble Theatre in
London, which I did in 2013-2014. Once I had completed my studies, my passion
for the arts was bigger than ever which led me to create my very own theatre
company where I intend to pursue all of my and my colleagues’ artistic goals
and make a difference to our world.  We
are mainly Italian performers (or from Italian families) and the show Circular
is very much based on Italian modern culture, society and history. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As for my own personal history and my
culture, they  are very important to me,
but most of all the people who I cherish and loved deeply from my past are the
ones who still give me strength to persue my artistic goals. Some of these
people are no longer alive, and it’s to them my show is dedicated to. This is
why this project is so important to me, I wrote this play dedicating it to my
Aunt Zia Lidia (1924-2011), who never failed o feed my theatrical motivation
and my mind. It will mean everything if I can share my story in an artistic and
theatrical manner in order to keep her memory alive. </p>

As a student I started to plan my own Theater Company and now I want to make it a reality but I need your help!!</p>
<p>I have a clear simple Goal : To Make Contemporary Theater both original and reinvent established works that a Younger Generation can connect to in a way they haven't before. And to give back to the Buffalo Region through Charitably events spreading peace, love and, compassion through Theater.</p>
<p>I feel as a young person just entering the Professional world there are ways of doing Theater that I believe could be more cost effective, environmentally, friendlier, and more sustainable for the Future. I want to create Minimalistic but effective peaces of theater and revisit some well known shows such as. ""Tick Tick Boom"", ""RENT"", ""The Rocky Horror Show"", and many others.

<p>Artistic Director</p> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","Short Summary Hello My name is Andrew J Rogers a recent Graduate of Buffalo State College and a Former Member of Casting Hall. As a student I started to plan my own Theater Company and now I want to make it a reality but I need your help!!
I have a clear simple Goal : To Make Contemporary Theater both original and reinvent established works that a Younger Generation can connect to in a way they haven't before. And to give back to the Buffalo Region through Charitably events spreading peace, love and, compassion through Theater.
I feel as a young person just entering the Professional world there are ways of doing Theater that I believe could be more cost effective, environmentally, friendlier, and more sustainable for the Future. I want to create Minimalistic but effective peaces of theater and revisit some well known shows such as. ""Tick Tick Boom"", ""RENT"", ""The Rocky Horror Show"", and many others. I would also be interested in holding workshops and working with Buffalo's Youth I believe our Youth deserve to be exposed to Live Theater and get a chance to be the Star they truly are.
But I need YOU!!   What We Need & What You Get 1,000 Dollars at the bare minimum would allow me to raise the money I need to get the Company on its feet by holding a Fundraiser featuring Local Buffalo Talent for a night of Musical Theater, Poetry, and other Live Acts. If this happens I would also like to have a Basket Raffle so donations for that would be greatly appreciated. It would also be helpful to be able to have at least Tee Shirts created to be able to sell if possible. To anyone that donates they will be entered into a drawing to win Two Free Tickets to the first Production of the Company when it is up and running and Founder Status in each and every Program from the Beginning till the End!!   The Impact Right now in Buffalo there are many Theaters But no Theater truly pushing the limits of Theater through innovation, inspiring others especially our youth and to try new and exciting things. I want to make a safe collaborative environment where we as artists can try new things and do it in a way that we can support each other and work towards one common goal which is to make Theater that speaks to everyone. I also want to build a environment where our audience is heard and can help us grow by listening and taking suggestions to heart. I believe constructive criticism is needed to make us all stronger in our craft.   Risks & Challenges  This entire Project won't be easy but having your support means the difference between its success and failure If 100 people donate each 10 dollars I would reach my goal tomorrow and be able to get this entire project off the ground.
It will not be easy I realize that I need to find the people to make this Company a reality. Artists that truly care about there craft and that want to make Theater that actually is meaningful. I need to find a space to produce shows which will be the biggest challenge and I need to fine stable and committed long-term donors that believe in my Mission Statement and are willing to help me make it a reality.
Getting Youth into the seats will be a challenge but creating entertainment they are interested in will help.
I also have a Price Structure to help with this issue.
Youth 18 and Under $10 Dollars
College Students and Seniors 65+ $15
General Admission $25
This is Subject to Change but I feel would be fair. I would also consider a Pay what you can Night.
   Other Ways You Can Help If you can't donate all I ask is you spread the word to people who can on Facebook, Twitter, Word of Mouth, Messenger Pigeon, Morris Code, etc.
But you can still be a part of making this all a reality.
I need the following.
1) Volunteers
2) A Board of Directors
3) Technical Staff including Stage Managers etc.

</div></div>","Short Summary Since 1979, King'sPlayers Theater has been providing accessible theater to the Seattle/Edmonds community. 
Artists of all backgrounds and experience levels come together to create one, singular moment of theater excellence
Maybe it's a stay at home mom who enjoyed theater in high school and wants to try again, or perhaps it's the actor who is just starting out, waiting to get experience on the stage before moving on to bigger venues, or even if it's someone who is just looking to try something new. We welcome all.

King'sPlayers is a learning and mentoring environment where support and encouragement are follow under the pursuit of theater excellence. What We Need
 Theater, even small theater, is expensive. Costumes, artistic personnel, musicians, sets, rights and venue rental all cost thousands of dollars. We are hoping YOU can put a dent in that!

</p><p>My name is Natalie J Kolosci, I
am the owner and artistic director (choreographer, teacher, music editor,
costume designer and administrative director) of <b>Civic Dance Center</b> located in
Portage, IN. I have been involved with dance for over 50 years with my
forte being ballet.  My ballet beginnings were with the<em> <strong>Allegro</strong> <strong>Ballet Company<em></em></strong></em><em></em> in Chicago where I was later introduced to <i><em><em><em><i>Miss</i> <i>Ann Barzel</i></em></em></em></i>, dance critic for the Chicago Tribune and Dance Magazine, and <i><em><i>Miss Elisa Stigler</i></em></i> who became  central figures in launching many acquaintances for me in the dance field during the next several years. </p><p>I made my ballet debut at age 8, dancing with the <strong>Bolshoi Ballet</strong> from Moscow, Russia as an 'extra' for their Chicago performances.  For the following six years, I continued to perform, alternating each year with the <strong>Kirov Ballet</strong> from Leningrad.  I received a medal of the Bolshoi Theatre from <em><i>Asaf Messerer</i></em>, Artistic Director of the company, and was asked to be the assistant coach for the Children' roles, while on tour in Chicago.  My professional debut came at age 15, dancing the lead role of the ""Sugar Plum Fairy"" with the Allegro Company.  <i>Richard Ellis </i>(of <strong>Ellis -DuBoulay Ballet School </strong>in Chicago) was another great inspiration for me, dancing parts in <em><em>Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella</em></em>, and <em>Giselle</em>.  For eight years I also performed in <strong>Ruth Page's</strong> production of the <em>Nutcracke</em>r Ballet in Chicago, directed by <i>Dolores </i>and <i>Larry Long</i>, progressing yearly to more advanced roles.</p><p>I was the owner of <strong>Natalie's School of Dance</strong> in Lake Station, IN, for over 20 years and traveled throughout the U.S. with my dance troupe, <em>""<b>FABULOUS FEET</b>,""</em> participating in regional and national competitions, conventions, lectures and performances, accumulating over 500 awards.  Several of my students have continued their dance education in college, while others have gone on to dance with major ballet companies in the U.S.  I did free-lance teaching and choreography in the Indiana/Illinois region for several years before I decided on settling with a new dance center in Portage, IN.  I've been there for over 10 years and continue to expand my technical classes and choreography.  I try to encourage students in the dance field who would otherwise have chosen a different arena.  Civic Dance Center's annual production of the Nutcracker and Winter Showcase has become a yearly holiday tradition in the community as it was for me many years ago!</p><p>
<br/><strong>MISSION STATEMENT</strong></p><p>Being a dancer is not only a physical activity – it is a state of mind. The longer one studies, the more each of the attributes is developed. The gifts of ballet training forever enrich who we are and remain with us throughout our lives. </p><p><strong><br/>MY CAMPAIGN</strong>
</p><p>My campaign is to raise funds to
be able to produce the full length ‘Nutcracker’ Ballet without asking for
donations from parents or using my own limited funds to pay for all the extra
expenses that go into a production such as this. This includes, but not limited
to, guest artists, costumes, scenery, props,  rehearsal
space/time, travel and storage expenses. 
Every day there are other expenses that put strains on our financial
budget.  We are a small group of students
and parents that volunteer time to work back stage, fix costumes, put together
props and many other functions that bring together this production. They love
the ballet and most importantly are excited to present the Nutcracker to our
community. </p>
<p>This campaign is important to me
because while with the <strong>Ruth Page Company</strong>, the first ballet I performed with them was the ""Nutcracker,"" at the McCormick Place in Chicago – being on stage with all the
professional dancers made me feel important; all the hard work I did in the
classroom was paying off while dancing on stage.  I want my students, in turn, to feel the same
way.  I want them to get excited about
the role they obtained, the costumes they are wearing, the people they are
dancing with and more importantly to feel good about themselves that they got
up on stage to perform for mom, dad, family and friends!</p><p><br/><strong>HOW YOU HELP</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The magnitude of what
contributors will help me achieve is a truly professional ballet along with an
opportunity to continue to produce such performances well into the future. </p>
<p></p><p>Nearly $10,000 was spent on our first production, purchasing over 100 costumes and materials for backdrops and props. I took on that debt myself and it took quite a few years to recover, but the production was absolutely beautiful and I couldn't have been more proud of my students. Each year more costumes are always added along with all the aforementioned expenses. Since this is our 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary, I wanted so passionately to present the full length ballet. This year, we have roughly $5200.00 in unaccounted expenses. We were able to raise nearly $2000.00 from a fund raiser, which leaves $3200.00 that I'd rather not put on my credit card again. I would like to do my best to avoid all the debt going forward, with help from others who love and are willing to support the arts in our community. Any contribution you can provide would have my utmost gratitude and be appreciated by all those involved. Thank you so very much!</p><br/><p><br/></p><br/>

<p>In 2015, Emily Berry, Artistic Director of B3W Performance Group (B3W), traveled for seven months around the world, initially implementing the The FORGIVENESS Project’s Community Workshop component across 6 continents and within 11 countries, including: China, India, Australia, Italy, Greece, Brazil, Thailand, South Africa, Scotland, England, and Denmark; as well as in Michigan and New York in the United States. During her travels, Emily discovered that creating a space for the expression of stories on forgiveness through art, words, and movement, provided an opportunity for transformation, regardless of culture, age, religion, or occupation.</p>
<p>Following this expedition, from 2016 to 2019, B3W will shift from multi-month incubation periods to a culmination of this research by performances in three parts, both locally in New York City, and internationally:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Through devised intermedia performances integrating words, live music, new media scenography, and movement, each body of work will highlight personal accounts from B3W artistic collaborators, in response to the FORGIVENESS Community Workshops. The FORGIVENESS Project hopes to intersect the arts with community by exploring the unraveling, the consequences, and the expressions of multiple viewpoints and stories of forgiving.</p>

Emily Berry and artistic collaborators of B3W Performance Group (B3W) bring The FORGIVENESS Project from workshops across the globe to the forefront of the stage from Friday to Sunday, May 20, 21, & 22, 2016 at BMCC Tribeca Performing Arts Center in New York City. Part community-building, part performance, The FORGIVENESS Project is a pursuit to recognize the hardships of forgiving through storytelling, hoping to come together as a unified people and share perspective, both at a personal and a global scale. Funds for this campaign will go directly towards the payment of artist and collaborator fees, as well as production costs for “FORGIVENESS - Part I: Forgiving the Personal,” and will play a vital role in bridging the gap with our $32,000 budget.

ABOUT THE FORGIVENESS PROJECT: PART COMMUNITY-BUILDING, PART PERFORMANCE



""You also learn from other people's stories. You feel less lonely in your own pain and are encouraged to move along on your path because you feel like people are walking with you."" - Workshop participant from Portici, Italy

In 2015, Emily Berry, Artistic Director of B3W Performance Group (B3W), traveled for seven months around the world, initially implementing the The FORGIVENESS Project’s Community Workshop component across 6 continents and within 11 countries, including: China, India, Australia, Italy, Greece, Brazil, Thailand, South Africa, Scotland, England, and Denmark; as well as in Michigan and New York in the United States. During her travels, Emily discovered that creating a space for the expression of stories on forgiveness through art, words, and movement, provided an opportunity for transformation, regardless of culture, age, religion, or occupation.
Following this expedition, from 2016 to 2019, B3W will shift from multi-month incubation periods to a culmination of this research by performances in three parts, both locally in New York City, and internationally:



Part I: Forgiving the Personal


Part II: How Can Forgiveness Play a Role in Dismantling Systems of Oppression


Part III: Self-Forgiveness


Through devised intermedia performances integrating words, live music, new media scenography, and movement, each body of work will highlight personal accounts from B3W artistic collaborators, in response to the FORGIVENESS Community Workshops. The FORGIVENESS Project hopes to intersect the arts with community by exploring the unraveling, the consequences, and the expressions of multiple viewpoints and stories of forgiving.

</h3>
<p>
Bonjour, 
</p>
<p>
Je m’appelle
Ruth Salama. Je suis née à Barcelone et ça fait déjà quelques
années que je travaille entre la France et l’Espagne.</p>
<p>
Je fais du
cirque,  du funambule et de l’aérien aux tissus. J’ai traversé
sur le fil avec mon balancier des fleuves et fait des ascensions aux
clochers des églises. Sous le chapiteau du cirque, j’ai tourné
avec un numéro de danse sur le fil, comme fil de fériste. En
France, j’ai découvert le cirque contemporain, donc, j’invente
des histoires que je raconte à l’aide du fil, les tissus… Ça,
c’est la partie cirque de ma vie.</p>
<p>
L’autre partie
de ma vie, c’est le flamenco que j’ai appris à danser quand
j’étais enfant. La danse ne m’a jamais abandonné et moi, je n’ai
jamais abandonné la danse. J’adore
le flamenco, c’est ma drogue!</p>
<p>
Le spectacle “Quiroquo flamenco”,  « Locura flamenca » en espagnol,
est notre nouveau projet : la rencontre du clown et du flamenco. Du
burlesque et du flamenco  avec, sur scène, moi et Roman « el
afilao » avec le regard complice de Gino, du cirque  la famille
Morallès.</p>
<p>
Cette création
mêlant burlesque et art flamenco est fait avec un immense amour et
respect , mais avec un grain de follie . Une danseuse naïve et
bavarde, maladroite avec ses éventails et ses robes, un musicien à
l’humour anglais qui suit sa danseuse comme il peut…Ces
personnages sont les ingrédients que le clown utilise pour créer de
la poésie et révéler une autre image du flamenco, loin des
sentiers battus.</p>

<h3>
Nos besoins</h3>
<p>
C’est la
première fois que nous lançons une campagne de financement
participatif.</p>
<p>
Nous travaillons
en Mayenne,   une zone rurale près de la Bretagne française  et
nous avons besoin des temps de répétition pour  créer et le temps
c’est de l’argent !</p>
<p>
En plus, les
professionnels sollicités ont besoin d’être payés pour
s’impliquer dans ce projet et pas dans un autre ! Bref, ce
sont des professionnels.</p>
<p>
Nous avons
par le moment, trois théâtres coproducteurs et nous avons reçu une
subvention mais ce n’est pas assez.</p>
<p>
Pour arriver
à la première avec sérénité, le 21 mai, avec un spectacle
susceptible d’être acheté par les programmateurs et les théâtres,
 nous avons besoin de récolter 5000 €.</p>
<p>
Avec cet
argent, nous pourrons payer les artistes, les costumes, l’affiche,
des micros spécifiques pour la guitare…</p>
<p>
Si nous ne
réussissons pas à récolter la totalité nous investirons surtout
dans  salaires et la communication.</p>
<p>
Si nous
récoltons plus, nous investirons surtout en une chargée de
diffusion pour faire tourner le spectacle après la première.</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
L’impacte</h3>
<p>
Nous sommes
une petite compagnie , Le cirque perdu, installée en zone  qui fait
partie des déserts ruraux du pays…</p>
<p>
Il y a des
grandes salles polyvalentes, mais souvent il n’y a pas de
spectacles. Nous faisons des spectacles dans des lieux insolites et
dans des petites villes. Nous amenons culture et art là où nous
nous posons, là où les institutions de l’état ne sont pas
présentes.</p>
<p>
Nous sommes
indépendants artistiquement et politiquement. Nous créons un peu
d’emploi quand même, dans notre territoire, faisant appel aux
artisans et commerçants de proximité.</p>
<p>
Des
spectacles mêlant burlesque et flamenco, il y en a pas à ma
connaissance… pas encore !</p>
<p>
Nous sommes
dans la dernière ligne droite à 1 mois de la première, le 21 mai.</p>
<p>
La prochaine
répétition avec public aura lieu le 15 avril à l’espace culturel
Colmont à Gorron, à 18h. 
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>D’autres
façons de donner un coup de pouce</b></h3>
<p>
Si ce projet
te plaît, aide nous à diffuser cette campagne : partage la,
s’il te plaît.</p>
<p>
Si le

Résumé


Bonjour, 


Je m’appelle
Ruth Salama. Je suis née à Barcelone et ça fait déjà quelques
années que je travaille entre la France et l’Espagne.

Je fais du
cirque,  du funambule et de l’aérien aux tissus. J’ai traversé
sur le fil avec mon balancier des fleuves et fait des ascensions aux
clochers des églises. Sous le chapiteau du cirque, j’ai tourné
avec un numéro de danse sur le fil, comme fil de fériste. En
France, j’ai découvert le cirque contemporain, donc, j’invente
des histoires que je raconte à l’aide du fil, les tissus… Ça,
c’est la partie cirque de ma vie.

L’autre partie
de ma vie, c’est le flamenco que j’ai appris à danser quand
j’étais enfant. La danse ne m’a jamais abandonné et moi, je n’ai
jamais abandonné la danse. J’adore
le flamenco, c’est ma drogue!

Le spectacle “Quiroquo flamenco”,  « Locura flamenca » en espagnol,
est notre nouveau projet : la rencontre du clown et du flamenco. Du
burlesque et du flamenco  avec, sur scène, moi et Roman « el
afilao » avec le regard complice de Gino, du cirque  la famille
Morallès.

Cette création
mêlant burlesque et art flamenco est fait avec un immense amour et
respect , mais avec un grain de follie . Une danseuse naïve et
bavarde, maladroite avec ses éventails et ses robes, un musicien à
l’humour anglais qui suit sa danseuse comme il peut…Ces
personnages sont les ingrédients que le clown utilise pour créer de
la poésie et révéler une autre image du flamenco, loin des
sentiers battus.



Equipe
artistique: Ruth Salama, Roman “el afilao”, Gino Moralles


Costumes: Cara
Murfin


Lumières et
son: Franck Biard, Laura Boutilly.


Graphisme :
Les presses du bocage, Gorron.


Communication:
Joseph de la Paz, Toc-toc diffusion


Conseil chorégraphique: école
de danse  Paca Garcia, Barcelone.




Nos besoins

C’est la
première fois que nous lançons une campagne de financement
participatif.

Nous travaillons
en Mayenne,   une zone rurale près de la Bretagne française  et
nous avons besoin des temps de répétition pour  créer et le temps
c’est de l’argent !

En plus, les
professionnels sollicités ont besoin d’être payés pour
s’impliquer dans ce projet et pas dans un autre ! Bref, ce
sont des professionnels.

Nous avons
par le moment, trois théâtres coproducteurs et nous avons reçu une
subvention mais ce n’est pas assez.

Pour arriver
à la première avec sérénité, le 21 mai, avec un spectacle
susceptible d’être acheté par les programmateurs et les théâtres,
 nous avons besoin de récolter 5000 €.

Avec cet
argent, nous pourrons payer les artistes, les costumes, l’affiche,
des micros spécifiques pour la guitare…

Si nous ne
réussissons pas à récolter la totalité nous investirons surtout
dans  salaires et la communication.

Si nous
récoltons plus, nous investirons surtout en une chargée de
diffusion pour faire tourner le spectacle après la première.






L’impacte

Nous sommes
une petite compagnie , Le cirque perdu, installée en zone  qui fait
partie des déserts ruraux du pays…

Il y a des
grandes salles polyvalentes, mais souvent il n’y a pas de
spectacles. Nous faisons des spectacles dans des lieux insolites et
dans des petites villes. Nous amenons culture et art là où nous
nous posons, là où les institutions de l’état ne sont pas
présentes.

Nous sommes
indépendants artistiquement et politiquement. Nous créons un peu
d’emploi quand même, dans notre territoire, faisant appel aux
artisans et commerçants de proximité.

Des
spectacles mêlant burlesque et flamenco, il y en a pas à ma
connaissance… pas encore !

Nous sommes
dans la dernière ligne droite à 1 mois de la première, le 21 mai.

La prochaine
répétition avec public aura lieu le 15 avril à l’espace culturel
Colmont à Gorron, à 18h. 


D’autres
façons de donner un coup de pouce

Si ce projet
te plaît, aide nous à diffuser cette campagne : partage la,
s’il te plaît.

Si le
flamenco ne t’emballe pas, pense que cette création aborde cet art
de manière originale et inattendue, tendre et avec un clin
d’œil…clownesquement !

Si tu ne
peux pas contribuer financièrement, mais tu veux nous aider,
bienvenu ! Si tu as des connaissances en graphisme,
photographie, informatique, si tu as des contactes, un ami producteur, une adresse… n’hésite pas.

Tout ce que
tu nous apporteras signifie beaucoup pour nous. Chaque grain de sable
aide et nous donne des forces ! Ecris
à cirqueperdu@ruthsalama.com

 Ton aide
est vitale. Avec créativité et ingéniosité nous y arriverons.
Merci infiniment!



Resumen

¡Hola! 
Me llamo Ruth Salama, he nacido en Barcelona, y llevo años
trabajando entre Francia y Barcelona.

Hago
circo. He hecho funambulismo a gran altura cruzando ríos  y plazas
encima de un cable. Bajo la carpa  del circo he girado con un número
de danza en la cuerda tensa en varios circos en Europa. En Francia
descubrí el circo contemporáneo así que invento historias que
cuento con el cable, con las telas… Esta es la parte circo de mi
vida.

Mi
otra parte es el flamenco que aprendí  a bailar cuando era una niña. Ni eso me ha abandonado nunca, ni yo he dejado de bailar. Me 
chifla el flamenco, soy adicta.

El
espectáculo” Locura flamenca”, (Quiproquo Flamenco en francés)
es nuestro nuevo proyecto: clown y flamenco. Humor y arte flamenco,
con el guitarrista Roman “el afilao” y la mirada externa de Gino, del circo: la familia Moralles.

El
proyecto rebosa amor y respeto a este arte, pero le añadimos
mucha locura: una
bata de cola mágica, unos abanicos sorprendentes, unas castañuelas
despistadas... Estos
son los  ingredientes. El clown lo guisa a su manera con ingenuidad,
poesía y humanidad.

<p>I first met Peter Freestone, Freddie Mercury's best friend, personal assistant and biographer, in 2006 while touring the world as bass guitarist for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6D5B8x67eY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Queen It's A Kinda Magic</a>, a large-scale theatre reproduction of rock's most majestic band.</p>
<p></p>

<p>We got to know each other over many dinners, drinks and stories during a 6-month world tour dubbed 'The Freddie Mercury 60th Birthday Tour' which Peter had agreed to endorse at the time. As a Queen fan and performer of the band's music, I was very fortunate to be granted such rare and revealing insights into the life of the man who's music I loved.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464413907/2006_Barcelona_front_wcpcup.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Fast forward to 2016. Peter and I have remained friends over the intervening decade, running into each other in various cities around the world on our respective travels. My work in the music industry has lead me to a tour manager position for an Australian-based booking agency called <a href=""http://www.firstbase.net.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">First Base</a>. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">And once again Peter has agreed to share his stories. This time with Australian audiences on a tour to c</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">elebrate what would have been Freddie’s 70</span><sup style=""background-color: initial;"">th</sup><span style=""background-color: initial;""> birthday in September 2016.</span></p>
<p>Presented
by First Base Events, <i><a href=""http://www.peterfreestone.com/tour"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You’re My Best Friend: An Evening With Peter Freestone</a> </i>will be an intimate evening of personal
stories, rock anecdotes, rare photos, unheard audio and audience Q&amp;A
covering the 12 years Peter spent living with and working for the Queen
frontman.</p>
<p>The
pair, who met in 1979 whilst Peter was working in wardrobe for London’s Royal Ballet, formed an immediate
friendship which saw Peter become Freddie’s personal assistant, a role he
continued daily until the singer’s untimely
death in 1991.</p>
<p>Author
of the memoir, <i>Freddie Mercury</i>
(Omnibus Press), Peter currently resides in the Czech Republic,
a place he has called home for the last 13 years between stints travelling the
world to make regular guest speaking appearances at AIDS awareness events and
Queen fan conventions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464414212/41wA3WWYUpL._SX328_BO1_204_203_200__gcq98m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In the lead up to the tour, Queen and
Freddie Mercury fans will have the chance to pre-purchase merchandise and limited spots on
private VIP events with Peter during his two weeks in Australia. This will be a unique opportunity to get up
close and personal with the man who knew Freddie Mercury best.<br/><br/>On offer will be signed prints from Peter's private collection, signed copies of his book, <i>Freddie Mercury: An Intimate Memoir</i>, t-shirts, tour posters, fan Polaroids, and the piece de resistance: a very limited number of seats at either breakfast, lunch or dinner tables with Peter for various dates and cities during the tour.</p>
<p>This is a rare opportunity for Queen and Freddie fans to meet, spend time with and hear first hand accounts of their hero from one of the people who knew Freddie best - Peter Freestone:</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“The whole world knew the musical genius, the master
of the stage. For me he was also the
kindest, most generous and loyal friend I could ever wish to have. </i></p>
<p><i>I was Freddie's chief cook and bottle washer, waiter,
butler, secretary, cleaner and agony aunt. I travelled the world with him,
acted as his bodyguard when needed and in the end, of course, I was one of his
nurses.”</i></p>
<p>So why are we doing this?</p>
<p>First and foremost, myself and my business partner at First Base are Queen fans. I ended up in a Queen tribute show and travelled the world simply because my absolute love of the band and their music lead me along that particular path of destiny. </p>
<p>As booking agents we wanted to take that passion and turn it into a successful tour aimed squarely at the fans. In doing so, we have been hands on, from our initial proposal to Peter on Facebook (""Hey Phoebe, this year will be Freddie's 70th and we've started a booking agency. Wanna tour Australia to celebrate?"") right up to booking the venues, organising national press and making sure that Peter's day to day needs will be met along the way.</p>
<p>As such we are<span style=""background-color: initial;""> underwriting all the expenses of a 2-week tour at our own financial risk; international flights to get Peter to Australia, appearance fees, marketing and promotion, venue hire, in-house production staff, domestic flights, accommodation in each city, daily meals, hire cars, fuel, parking, per diems, entertainment expenses, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">While we have secured some financial backing, it's still not the amount required to get us over the line to cover the initial tour set up and running expenses. Therefore, this campaign is all about inviting fans to be part of our journey and in the deal giving them access to something that they can't get elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">By purchasing any of the perks we have on offer here at our campaign you will not only be rewarded with some amazing experiences, but you'll also be helping us to make this a successful tour and increasing our scope to make many more such tours in the future with people like Peter Freestone. In fact we've already reached out to one of David Bowie's former producers - watch this space.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">All funds raised from our campaign will go toward tour running expenses. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">So head over to the'PERKS' section of this campaign and see what's available! All purchases can be made via credit card or Paypal.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We look forward to meeting some of you out on the road and hope that some of what we have on offer here can help make a wish or two come true for Queen and Freddie Mercury fans alike. Just as mine did many years before.</span></p>

Fast forward to 2016. Peter and I have remained friends over the intervening decade, running into each other in various cities around the world on our respective travels. My work in the music industry has lead me to a tour manager position for an Australian-based booking agency called First Base. 
And once again Peter has agreed to share his stories. This time with Australian audiences on a tour to celebrate what would have been Freddie’s 70th birthday in September 2016.
Presented
by First Base Events, You’re My Best Friend: An Evening With Peter Freestone will be an intimate evening of personal
stories, rock anecdotes, rare photos, unheard audio and audience Q&A
covering the 12 years Peter spent living with and working for the Queen
frontman.
The
pair, who met in 1979 whilst Peter was working in wardrobe for London’s Royal Ballet, formed an immediate
friendship which saw Peter become Freddie’s personal assistant, a role he
continued daily until the singer’s untimely
death in 1991.
Author
of the memoir, Freddie Mercury
(Omnibus Press), Peter currently resides in the Czech Republic,
a place he has called home for the last 13 years between stints travelling the
world to make regular guest speaking appearances at AIDS awareness events and
Queen fan conventions.


In the lead up to the tour, Queen and
Freddie Mercury fans will have the chance to pre-purchase merchandise and limited spots on
private VIP events with Peter during his two weeks in Australia. This will be a unique opportunity to get up
close and personal with the man who knew Freddie Mercury best.On offer will be signed prints from Peter's private collection, signed copies of his book, Freddie Mercury: An Intimate Memoir, t-shirts, tour posters, fan Polaroids, and the piece de resistance: a very limited number of seats at either breakfast, lunch or dinner tables with Peter for various dates and cities during the tour.
This is a rare opportunity for Queen and Freddie fans to meet, spend time with and hear first hand accounts of their hero from one of the people who knew Freddie best - Peter Freestone:

“The whole world knew the musical genius, the master
of the stage. For me he was also the
kindest, most generous and loyal friend I could ever wish to have. 
I was Freddie's chief cook and bottle washer, waiter,
butler, secretary, cleaner and agony aunt. I travelled the world with him,
acted as his bodyguard when needed and in the end, of course, I was one of his
nurses.”
So why are we doing this?
First and foremost, myself and my business partner at First Base are Queen fans. I ended up in a Queen tribute show and travelled the world simply because my absolute love of the band and their music lead me along that particular path of destiny. 
As booking agents we wanted to take that passion and turn it into a successful tour aimed squarely at the fans. In doing so, we have been hands on, from our initial proposal to Peter on Facebook (""Hey Phoebe, this year will be Freddie's 70th and we've started a booking agency. Wanna tour Australia to celebrate?"") right up to booking the venues, organising national press and making sure that Peter's day to day needs will be met along the way.
As such we are underwriting all the expenses of a 2-week tour at our own financial risk; international flights to get Peter to Australia, appearance fees, marketing and promotion, venue hire, in-house production staff, domestic flights, accommodation in each city, daily meals, hire cars, fuel, parking, per diems, entertainment expenses, etc.
While we have secured some financial backing, it's still not the amount required to get us over the line to cover the initial tour set up and running expenses. Therefore, this campaign is all about inviting fans to be part of our journey and in the deal giving them access to something that they can't get elsewhere. 
By purchasing any of the perks we have on offer here at our campaign you will not only be rewarded with some amazing experiences, but you'll also be helping us to make this a successful tour and increasing our scope to make many more such tours in the future with people like Peter Freestone. In fact we've already reached out to one of David Bowie's former producers - watch this space.
All funds raised from our campaign will go toward tour running expenses. So head over to the'PERKS' section of this campaign and see what's available! All purchases can be made via credit card or Paypal.
We look forward to meeting some of you out on the road and hope that some of what we have on offer here can help make a wish or two come true for Queen and Freddie Mercury fans alike. Just as mine did many years before.
Thank you!David Christopher*First Base*

<div>Is World Domination.</div>
<div>My name is Catherine Waller and I am the creator of ""The Creeps"", an award winning dark solo clown show that has been accepted into 3 of the most prestigious theatre festivals in the world. I was born in New Zealand and trained at Toi Whakaari: the New Zealand National Drama school, where I learnt and fell in love with the art of clowning and bouffon (dark clown). In 2014 I devised The Creeps as part of the Hollywood Fringe Festival and received awards such as Best Female Performer and Producer's Encore Award.</div>
<div>Now, I'm taking it on tour.</div>
<div>It has been a dream of mine to work as an artist on a global scale since I graduated school. I am a passionate story teller, a driven performer, and someone who is committed to impacting the world on a global scale by making moving, visceral and beautiful art. I have the capacity and the commitment to achieve all I've ever wanted for myself and my life. I want to be A World Renowned Superstar, and I want you to help me.</div>
<div>On August 1st, my producer Elle Shaw and I will fly from Los Angeles to Scotland where I will perform 6 shows in the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. We then travel to London where I perform in the Camden Fringe. We will travel through Europe by train and then fly to New York City to perform in the New York Clown Festival, before going to Boston to perform, back to LA, then back to New York in October to perform in the United Solo Festival; the largest solo festival in the world, on 42nd street in Times Square of New York City.</div>
<div>I told myself 4 years ago I wanted to take my show to Broadway, and for it to actually be happening, is almost unbelievable.</div>
<div>What we need to do this is $25,000, and your help.</div> <p></p>
<p>“Catherine Waller has created a piece of art in the truest sense of the word. For 45 minutes you are glued to your seat watching her transform from one character to another in a dark world. One second there’s humor and the next a glimmer into the depressing reality of this underworld she’s created using only herself. She wonderfully inhabits the empty space, bringing it to life through her physicality within the space. Her performance is fearless and moving and even in its extremities it is laced with heartfelt truth and comedy. This show is proof that there is still creativity and wonderful originality in theatre.” <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">-</span><em style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Eve Danzeisen</em></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What is The Creeps? And how does it impact?</h3>
<div>The Creeps is a dark, visceral, emotional and physical clown show where I play 5 characters, all completely different in their physical traits, who all exist in a lonely and mysterious world, and who all interact directly with audience. The show is transformative, interactive, and personal, and offers a unique experience for an audience that is truly alive. In fact, I literally demand the audience is a part of it. The reason why I love this show so much, and why I believe it can exist on an international level, is because I am providing a transformative experience, one that is odd and absurd and yet to its core is about humanity and connection. It provokes the question: ""What is theater in 2016?"" and how can a simple solo black box show provide such a potent experience. I'm on a mission to find out.<br/>
</div>
<div>Reviews of the show, and the impact it has had on audiences:</div>
<div>
<em>""Catherine schizophrenically slips from one character to the next, pulling us through the rooms of the asylum she effortlessly creates. You have no choice but to go along and be teased, seduced, intimidated, and entertained.""  </em><em>- Alek Tomkiw</em>
</div>
<div><em>“Catherine Waller is a creature apart. In her new solo show <strong>THE CREEPS</strong> she manages to summon four highly distinct personalities that will seer themselves into your mind for days and days to come. I don’t want to give anything away but the title is a perfect description of the vibe from beginning to end. Her body morphs almost supernaturally into distinct personalities so pathetic, disturbed and disturbingly relatable. At times it feels like a horror movie – by horror I mean the horrors of the soul and the mirror is constantly turned on the audience in its interactive format. She crawls around the floor doing things with light and sound that are so perfectly timed that she seems to surpass the physical world entirely."" - Michael Shaw Fisher<br/></em></div>
<div>
<p>“<strong>THE CREEPS</strong> was a superb show that I wish I would’ve caught before its closing night. The Creeps follows 4 characters and leaves you at the edge of your seat the whole time. Catherine Waller is an absolute genius in combining a comedy with dark truths whilst breaking the fourth wall and interacting in conversation with the audience. I never knew one person could bring so many emotions to me in a 45-minute production.  The lighting was creative and accented the mood entirely. The background noise brought the show to life and though it was just a plain black box theatre, the set was perfect. Waller has core strength beyond belief and used her dance background throughout the show in lyrical ways. It was honestly such an amazing experience, watching a show where I could ask questions and access the minds of the characters, and it was so perfectly timed in how Waller would say open ended things compelling you to speak up and ask.  Throughout the story, one of the characters said repeatedly “I’ve got what you want” and Waller gave just that. Waller gave me everything I’ve wanted to see in a show before I even knew what I wanted to see, and I can’t stress enough how much I wish there were more shows so I could go again and bring more people, and with such an interactive show, it could’ve been completely different the next time. Swag.”<em> -Marcus Wells</em></p>
<p>“Distortion reveals—-darkness liberates—-hysteria serves as the foot soldier of truth. <strong>THE CREEPS </strong>forces us to confront our broken counterparts.  Talk, literally talk, to creatures that don’t exist, funneled through one woman metamorphosing into vastly different physical and psychological figures in the space of a blackout.  Catherine Waller frees these creeps from the corner of your eyes and the edges of your limbic system. In this dark comedy, you laugh as your hair stands on end, trying to escape.  Intentions turn ambiguous, reality shifts in a moment, and paradoxes dance—-when the most hospitable is the most sinister, when the most pathetic is the most noble, when the most exploited is the most in need, when the most battered is the most cruel.  Twisted by their own evil or their own need for salvation, each creep is both abuser and abused: Cast-offs, relegated/exiled to a basement of terrors where modern-day and fairy-tale detritus decay in the same heap.  Anything can happen, because the creeps can see you. You can’t hide. You’re paralyzed in your chair.  You think: I can’t become one of these creeps. I have to get out of here. I can’t be associated with them. And as they treat you as their own, you feel yourself distorting, disintegrating, becoming grotesque.  Will you listen to the evil and fall for it? Will you embrace the good, even if it is damaged, infected, deadly? Can you save anyone? Will you dare? Can you save yourself?  <strong>THE CREEPS</strong> are isolated——they enjoy the company——but you might not be able to leave. They might keep you there forever. Indulge them, and let them mingle with your own enigmas, demons and malformations.  You will leave relieved. At least you’re not doomed, controlled, locked in eternal pain and confusion like the creeps.  Except we are. And that’s the comedy of “The Creeps.””<em>-Isaac Mell</em></p>
<p>“My only regret is that I didn’t see this show earlier in its run because I would’ve seen it again and again and again. I’ve tried to start this review many times but can’t seem to find the words to justly describe how amazing the world was that Catherine Waller created. Her performance was genuine and perfect and present and everything great acting should be. I don’t think anyone in that theatre wanted it to end. As I said to her after seeing the show, my mind was blown.” -<em>Courtney Cunningham</em></p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>If we do not reach our goal we will create new pathways to fundraise the money we need to tour, such as private investments and art grants. The challenge with this is making sure we have it in time to book our flights, accommodation, and completing payments to all theatres by the date we have agreed to. However, this tour is happening!

<h3>in a nutshell</h3>
<p>Gutted is a play written by Sharon Byrne.</p>
<p>Three women working in a Dublin fish factory tell the stories of their lives - sometimes painfully tragic, sometimes shocking and funny. They swear and sing, transporting you away from the chill water and bloodied fish, with the music, social mores and politics of 1980's Ireland.</p>
<p>The fine and insightful team at the Marlowe Theatre, Canterbury, has invited Sharon Byrne to produce Gutted for seven whole performances from 21-25 February 2017.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>we need to raise £2,000</b></h3>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<p>We are working with talented actors and a committed production team including, an award-winning set designer and an expert technical crew.  What we need now, is a chance to pay our cast and crew in more than just fish. We need your help to raise £2,000 to produce Gutted in February 2017.</p>
<p>With your help we'll be able to pay for:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>set design and build</li>
<li>costumes and props</li>
<li>PRS music licence</li>
<li>cast, stage manager &amp; director pay and expenses</li>
<li>producer fees </li>
</ul>
<p>If we reach our stretch targets, </p>
<p>The more we raise, the more we'll do. Exceeding our targets will help us to create opportunities to put Gutted on the road to other regional and London theatres. With your help we will be able to produce programmes, Gutted jewellery and make printed copies of the script available for our keen audience (in the theatre and here on Indiegogo). </p>
<p>We are also applying for other Arts/Theatre grants, so we aren't putting all our eggs in the crowdfunding basket. The Marlowe Theatre is being incredibly supportive with a range of staffing, publicity, technical and rehearsal space support. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>to show you how good Gutted feels</h3>
<p>Gutted: a feeling. When you miss an opportunity. When you lose a friend. When you feel betrayed and your heart is left in a bloody mess on the floor. You're gutted, but you know you have to go on. You've got one life and you're going to live it.</p>
<p>This play is about three women working in a fish factory in Dublin in the 1980s. Work here everyday and you'll understand why someone would want to talk about life outside - even if that life is difficult and the people you trust let you down. </p>
<p>Everyone has dreams though. And this play is ultimately about surviving, thriving and a shared understanding of how gutted <i>feels</i>.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>because no-one can predict the future</h3>
<p>Our biggest risk if we don't achieve our funding target is that we won't be able to pay our cast and crew. We'd be gutted, they'd be gutted, and you? Well, maybe you'd be gutted too. Please help us to put on an amazing performance.</p>
<p>We are looking at lots of ways to achieve our goal through a range of perks being made available through this crowdfunding campaign but also through networking and sales to the people and businesses we know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising &amp; sponsorship packages</li>
<li>Gutted t-shirts and sweatshirts</li>
<li>Rehearsal insights</li>
<li>Script sales</li>
