<p><i><span style=""font-size:0.85em;color:#0070C0;"">In the morning a mop guy woke me up. He started to poke me and speak something in his own way. What language does he speak?

As I left outside, I was struck by the heat. Macabre! I am in Africa only a few days and my body has not yet adjusted to the heat. I'm wet all the time, the sun is so sharp, even the dark sunglasses does not help much, and on my skin, I feel as if someone is stabbing a million thin pins in it. Well, I have to survive, somehow.

</div>
<p> </p>
<p>It's a fragment of a traveler's diary that describes one day of his hero's journey. It would be nice to be able to write such a relationship of your own experiences...</p>

<p><b><span style=""font-size:1.5em;color:#0070C0;"">What do you think about traveling?</span></b></p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image002.png"" hspace=""12"" src=""""/> When we think of an influx of extra cash (e.g., banished on a lottery, higher than the usual bonus, the completion of a long work), travels are almost always being on our list of planned expenses. When we are overworked, we would mostly like to go somewhere. We often want to visit ""warm countries"", we also dream of traveling around the world. Or maybe a short break in Rome, to see how people lived in the times of the emperors and a quick look at the Vatican.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image003.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It usually ends with a trip to the hotel e.g. in Greece and laze on the beach for a week or two. More active travel remains in the sphere of dreams because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image004.png"" hspace=""12"" src=""""/>They cost too much and just exceed your financial capacity...</li>
<li>If we have money, we have no time...</li>
<li>It would be nice to fly somewhere far away, but we are afraid to fly...</li>
<li>We do not have anyone to go with...</li>
<li>We do not speak foreign languages...</li>
<li>We do not know the customs of the people in the countries we want to visit... We do not want to be ridiculous in the eyes of the natives...</li>
<li>We fear diseases, thefts, robberies, terrorists...</li>
<li>We do not like touts, beggars... We do not like to be hounded and forced to get rid of money...</li>
<li>We do not really know what and where we can see and generally how to spend time...</li>
<li>We are afraid that we will be able to handle this...</li>
</ol>
<p>Only obstacles...</p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image005.png"" hspace=""12"" src=""""/>Let me show up at this place (a middle-aged guy, who has seen something in his life and knows a bit, from not so rich (in terms of available funds) European country), with the concept of an unusual online game ""BavelTravel"" that allows you to virtually travel around the world without these obstacles. </p>
<p>This is not a real journey but its high fidelity simulation. but:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image006.png"" hspace=""12"" src=""""/> Forget about costs – you play completely free. You can buy some facilities to increase your chances for better result (up to $4.99 per month).</li>
<li>No doubt you will find some time. You can break the game any time and then continue from the break point.</li>
<li>You fly virtually, so fear disappears. The effect of clogged ears and time shift too.</li>
<li>To play the game you only need an Internet connection and web browser. You are competing with other players of the game. You can even meet them virtually and travel together.</li>
<li>You only need basic knowledge of English. You can use internet translator. During the game you will see pages from Wikipedia that describes visited places – you can change the language there.</li>
<li>You do not need knowledge of customs. You will find interesting trivia about a given country or place.</li>
<li>I warn you. You can fall into the habit of traveling! It's a very serious illness! ☺</li>
<li>Costs only in virtual money.</li>
<li>The game has big educational value. By playing, you will learn a lot about the most interesting places to visit all over the world, what you can use in real journeys.</li>
<li>Surely you can manage! You can only win, even a real prize (mostly cash).</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><b><span style=""font-size:1.5em;color:#0070C0;"">What is it all about?</span></b></p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image007.png"" hspace=""12"" src=""""/> You can travel to more than 2500 airports in all countries and territories around the world. You can choose air connections from more than half a milion flights! You can also use public transport, taxis, buses, ferries, you can rent a car or even hitchhike. You can visit more than 8,000 places (cities, islands, nature reserves, etc.) and see over 20,000 sights (historical monuments, natural wonders, amusement parks, etc.) – in several dozens of categories or take advantage of the available activities (several dozens of types), e.g. diving, downhill typing, swimming with dolphins, climbing, etc.</p>
<p>The goal is to get as many points as possible in the varying monthly tasks. ""+"" points are: visited countries, airports, places, sights and their categories, activities and their types, online meetings with other users of the application, creating electronic ""postcards"", completing tasks, distance traveled. The number of points decreases the amount of money spent and the duration of the task (not the real time – you can play as long as you want, but the ""game time"" associated with the real time spent on given place in the real world).</p>
<p>The whole game is based on the most real information! All the elements of the game are real – you are traveling through really existing countries, airports, places and visit real tourist attractions. You need a real amount of time and money.</p>
<p><b><span style=""font-size:1.5em;color:#0070C0;"">What gives you points?</span></b></p>
<p>Each element of the game gives you different amounts of points.</p>
<p>The point value of the visited country is related to the ease of arriving in a given country. You will get more points for visiting Kiribati or Chad, than for visiting France or USA.</p>
<p>Similarly, with airports – big Fumicino Airport near Rome will give you fewer points than any local airport, e.g. in Colombia.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image008.png"" hspace=""12"" src=""""/> In the case of places, sights and activities, the opposite principle applies –more familiar places gives you more points</p>
<p>Places and sights were chosen from publicly available information. The most important sources include:</p>
<ul>
<li>UNESCO World Heritage List,</li>
<li>Hilmans list – 1000 of the most worth a visit places in the world,</li>
<li>Recommended places from tourist portals such as Trip Advisor, Lonely Planet and more.</li>
</ul>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image009.png"" hspace=""12"" src=""""/> Activities also have their scoring algorithm – for example, more points you will get for diving on a known Caribbean coral reef than at a swimming pool in a big city. In general, the amount of activity points depends on the popularity of the place.</p>
<p>For the categories of sights and types of activities, you get a fixed amount of points of each and in addition ""stamps"" to the status resembling scout skills.</p>
<p>You will also get a fixed amount of points for ""meeting"" with another player. This is the only ""unreal"" element of the game, it reminds to read in mind and travel in time ☺. You can look at where a different player is at a given moment, but on his ""game clock"" it will probably be a different date and time. To meet, you have to ""wait"" for the player in our game time until he arrives at that time or asks him to wait for you.</p>
<p align=""center&lt;img"" height=""289"" src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image010.png"" width=""343""> </p>
<p>It's like a multidimensional world, in which every player ""lives"" in another dimension/time! Futuristic!. Believe me, in the game it is simpler than my explanation.☺ Meetings with players can be the beginning of a shared journey. You can reduce costs (you can share rooms in hotels, share costs of car renting and taxi), and gain more points (you can use more experience of other players).</p>
<p>Generally, in the game, points for a given element of the trip can only be obtained once. This means that revisiting a given site does not give you additional points.</p>
<p><b><span style=""font-size:1.5em;color:#0070C0;"">Everything costs... virtual money</span></b></p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image011.png"" hspace=""12"" src=""""/> Traveling costs money and time. In the game I introduced virtual money – Goldies (abbreviated GLD). All prices are in GLD. 1 GLD is about ¼ USD. Why such a value? It allows practically not to use fractional parts. All prices are rounded to 1 GLD.</p>
<p>Admission prices to sights (as well as their opening hours) are based on data from the Internet. Airline tickets prices are based partly on real prices (including ""low cost"" connections) as well as the results of statistical surveys (price per passenger per kilometer for an airline). However, I do not take into account the fact of the possibility of buying cheaper tickets in advance – in the game we pay for the ticket just before departure! Prices for accommodation, meals, car rental, taxis, public transportation, buses, etc. are based on the country or city statistical data.</p>
<p>In most tasks you have unlimited money – but you count how much you spent. However, there are tasks with a limited amount of funds. This kind of task ends when you spend the last GLD.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image012.png"" hspace=""12"" src=""""/> The journey time is also based on reality. This applies to air connections and to travel times by other means of communication. Also, the time of the sightseeing is also real – the minimum amount of time you have to spend on the sight is counted. Sometimes it goes wrong with reality – for example, to ""beach"" in the game, you have to spend 1 hour on it, but in reality, if the beach is beautiful, the weather is great, the company is cool, we will be happy to spend a few hours there. Time is important because it reduces the number of points earned. Some of the tasks are ""sprinters tasks"", where time has a big impact on the final result.</p>
<p><b><span style=""font-size:1.5em;color:#0070C0;"">Types of tasks</span></b></p>
<p>Tasks can be constructed in many ways. In general, there is a form of movement in each task. Each has a clearly defined purpose. All the ways to earn points are also available.</p>
<p>But the score in each task may be counted differently. All game elements gives points. Usually, most of the game elements have a standard score. This can be defined as the multiplier x 1. In sprint-like tasks, the overall score of the game is more affected by time – it has an exemplary x 5 multiplier with respect to the standard. For tasks that involve visiting a mandatory list of sights, the multiplier x 5 is used for visiting exactly those sights. Other sights are also counted towards the result but with a multiplier of x 1 or even lower. In tasks with limited funds multiplier x 5 is used for the amount of money spent. In tasks where you have to return to the starting point, for the completion of the task, usually the final result is multiplied by 2...</p>
<p>Changing the ways of counting points and ""mandatory"" places to visit can create virtually unlimited number of different tasks.</p>
<p>Descriptions of tasks introduces the user to a situation, start a story, that the user will continue performing the task. A simple example. The task is to visit Buenos Aires. The description of the task may look like this:&lt;</p>
<div style=""width:80%;margin:auto;""><p><i><span style=""font-size:0.85em;color:#0070C0;"">I like to watch music movies since I remember. I admire the artistry of singers and dancers in them. I would also like to move on the stage, to take on various characters... I went dancing classes, but I thought classical dances was not for me. In modern films, most popular are hip-hop, modern dance, popping, etc. Waltz, foxtrot are out-of-date ... But lately, I changed my mind. I saw the movie ""Moulin Rouge"" and fell in love with the Argentine tango. Those emotions, until my cries passed my back as I saw the dance to ""Roxanne""... This dancer, as he made his partner... just ""world championship"" ;). I decided – I want to dance the Argentine tango. I immediately started to search for courses, but in my city, they teach only classical tango... Small research – the ""capital"" of Argentine tango is, as expected, Buenos Aires. There are two-week courses taught in English. I'm going! I will be there a lot of time, classes take 2-3 hours a day, so by the way I'm going to explore a bit. Or maybe we'll meet there and go out together? And lessons will be more fun... I'm leaving next week...</span></i></p></div>
<p>An additional element in this task is a need to come to one of the dance schools in Buenos Aires at a specific time each day... Each ""lesson learned"" will give you extra points.</p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">Sponsored and user tasks</span></i></b></p>
<p>Tasks can be constructed by a team of people serving the game (today it is a single man team ☺), these can be user tasks (the blog is the place where I invite you to build tasks) or sponsored tasks. The scoring rules are always tailored to the nature of the task. There are also extra points of unusual things to do</p>
<p><b><span style=""color:red;"">SPONSORS WELCOME</span></b><b><span style=""font-family:Wingdings;color:red;"">J</span></b><b><span style=""color:red;"">.</span></b></p>
<p>Let's assume that the task sponsor is a company that owns hotels in many places around the world. The task may consist in visiting hotels from the sponsor's network. For example, to complete the task player must visit the official websites of the hotels and make a ""postcard"" from pictures on this page or read materials from a sponsor prepared especially for the game and pass a simple quiz. Virtual accommodation in such a hotel can be virtually free and will give players extra points.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image013.png"" hspace=""12"" src=""""/> Another idea of a sponsored task may be, for example, doing virtual shopping in a sponsor's store chain. Suppose it is a clothing company and you want to complete some clothing (for example for a young woman), and the difficulty will be that shoes can only be bought in one group of stores with different locations, another group of shops will offer underwear and yet another coat, etc.</p>
<p>It is possible to construct various tasks. The only condition is that the task action <b><span style=""color:red;"">MUST</span></b> be located in real places in the world! The locations of the sponsors' shops, in the example above, must correspond to their actual locations, but the assortment to buy does not have to be exactly the same.</p>
<p>Each user can present his concept of the task. The most interesting tasks will be published in tasks list with the annotation of originator. I invite you to cooperation!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And Now for Something Completely Different!</p>
<p><b><span style=""font-size:1.5em;color:#0070C0;"">Why is the game called BavelTravel?</span></b></p>
<p>The simplest answer – the baveltravel.com domain was available ☺</p>
<p>But that's not true – I was looking for a name for the game that would be associated with travel. At first, it was ""Incredible Journeys"", but it turned out that there are already web pages with addresses containing this name and I did not know how it should be correctly pronounced in English ☺. I wanted the name of the game to be associated with travel and then ""accidentally"" saw a video of Katy Perry – ""Chained To The Rhythm"" (see YouTube). Katy pronounces the words ""bubble"" and ""trouble"" in the very interesting way (and an amusement park, especially roller coaster makes an impression ☺).</p>
<p align=""center""><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image014.jpg"" src=""""/></b></p>
<p>It inspired me to come up with a similarly named ""Babel Travel"" – the associations are OK – travels and tower of Babel – that is the confusion of languages. But babel is a service/language learning software, occupied website... I started rummaging through the net... and I found ☺ – bavel means babel in ancient Hebrew language!</p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image015.png"" hspace=""12"" src=""""/> And so was the name of the game and the initial logo version, a little like a pin – it can be a marker on the map.</p>
<p><b><span style=""font-size:1.5em;color:#0070C0;"">Why I need crowdfunding?</span></b></p>
<p>The concept of this type of game, with cool playability and educational values, was born 15 years ago when I worked on inventing games, mainly tabletop games. Even one of that games is suitable for publication, but I ran out of funds... <span style=""font-family:Wingdings;"">L</span>. I recently released it for free, in the form of a PDF file with game supplies for printing and scissors cuttings. I will mention here my new idea – a platform for publishing various types of our ""creativity"" in the form of free PDFs – the working name ""pdfidea"". Maybe details will be presented in future on Indiegogo ☺ This project is in the preliminary stage now.</p>
<p>I have been working on BavelTravel for a year and a half! Most of the time takes the creation of various databases related to traveling.</p>
<p>The creation of database of more than half a million flights took several months... But it's finished. It is based on real connections from mid-2016. I analyzed the traffic of over 21,000 commercial aircraft from over 700 airlines!. Of course, real airline connections are changing very often, schedules are associated with the seasonality, but for the purposes of the game, such a database is completely sufficient.</p>
<p>The most laborious database of tourist attractions and activities is almost finished. I estimate that ¾ work has already been done. I need about 2 months to finish it.</p>
<p>There is also a database of multi-day tours – another attraction of the game. It is waiting for integration with the tourist attractions and will be added to the next version of the game.</p>
<p>Similarly, finished cruise lines and ferry connections databases will be added in the future. I'm still working on one-day-trips database.</p>
<p>There is a question about software and graphics. These elements need your support! I need funds to hire a client-server application programmer with knowledge of Python, Django, SQL, JavaScript, Ajax, JQuery, responsive web pages and a few other tools. Theoretically, I can write the software myself (I have 30 years of experience in this field) but it will take a long time.</p>
<p>The graphic designer is the second indispensable person to cooperate with. As you continue reading, you will see preliminary page designs. As mockups such graphics are sufficient, but to the final version is still far away. I have a few ideas about dynamic, attractive user interface but I need someone to do it.</p>
<p>Speaking of ""music"" today's state of work on the graphics can be described as composition almost ready, but I still have to write down instruments, add a few solos and other decorations ☺. As instruments, I understand computers, tablets, smartphones, etc. And as decorators – the choice of colors, fonts, animations, navigation techniques. Here is work for graphic designer.</p>
<p>Assuming gathering $10,000 I plan to finish the project until June/July break of 2018, the beta version should be available at baveltravel.com in early spring. More money will accelerate the development of the app and increase its visual quality. There will also be additional bonuses for the users I'm referring to later.</p>
<p>An unsuccessful attempt to raise funds will not end the application. However, it will significantly increase the time it takes to build it. I will not be able to hire co-workers... so the graphics page will suffer... Working on this application gives me a lot of satisfaction, I consult my ideas with friends and strangers from different backgrounds. The ""moral"" support, what I get from it, confirms my belief in the ""value"" of this project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed my presentation. Thank you for your attention, I apologize for the language mistakes (I'm not from an English-speaking country) and please remember to support the project ☺</p>
<p>I will be happy to answer any questions you may have to help your decision to support.</p>
<p>I invite you to a virtual tour of the world! Soon...</p>

<p>The difficulty of the task is determined by the opinion of the players.</p>
<p>The new task has an ""unknown"" <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image017.png"" src=""""/> difficulty at the beginning. Each player after completing the task is asked to determine his difficulty scale:</p>
<div style=""width:80%;margin:auto;"">
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image018.png"" src=""""/> easy</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image019.png"" src=""""/> rather easy</p>

<p><b><span style=""color:red;"">Warning!</span></b> User can perform each task any number of times, but only the best result will be saved in the task history. The best result will also affect the total number of visited countries, airports, places, sights, activities, categories of sights and types of activities – that is, the values accumulated from all user completed tasks affecting its status in the game.</p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">User panel</span></i></b></p>
<p>At any time by clicking on the username, you can access the user panel, where you can see your status, achievements (tasks history, rankings, best results). You can also log out and change the user. Here you can also change some parameters of your account – for example, change your profile picture.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image025.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-size:0.85em;"">The countries visited by the user in all the tasks in which he participated and his status.</span></i></p>
<p>In the user panel, you can also see what you have purchased, the expiration date and purchase new facilities... Generally, payments can be made through PayPal. Financial prizes are transferred to the user through PayPal as well.</p>

<p>Some of the information contained in this panel is available to other users via chat (achievements in the game, a map of visited countries, public postcards, profile picture, a country you represent).</p>
<p>In the user panel, you will also find <b><span style=""color:red;"">your unique link</span></b> to send to friends as a game invitation. Inviting friends to play affects the prize pool (see Prizes section). In addition, for successful invitations to every 10 people (successful invitation = new user visit <a href=""http://www.baveltravel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.baveltravel.com</a> with your unique link sent to him, sign up and start doing any task) you will get a free ""<b><span style=""color:red;""> starter pack</span></b>"" – the same as when registering to the game. You can use this package yourself or transfer it to another player.</p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">Statuses</span></i></b></p>
<p>There are no classic levels in this game. The status of the user is determined by a number of visited countries for all tasks in which the user participated. The remaining parameters (number of completed tasks, visited airports, places, etc.) are included in the overall rating of the users with the same number of visited countries. Statuses are updated with the appearance of new tasks on the first day of the month.</p>
<p>Depending on the number of countries visited, users receive statuses according to the scheme:</p>

<p>I plan the possibility to buy (for the lowest levels)/receive free (for higher levels – from the globetrotter up) scarfs in status color with logo and game name. However, this requires additional organizational activities – such as ordering appropriate scarfs and organizing cheap shipping. However, I need information of the needs, which will come out only after the game release. If my campaign collects 200% of the required founds then scarfs will be for sure and will be given to the donors first.</p>
<p>Let's return to the tasks.</p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">Performing tasks</span></i></b></p>
<p>You can start the task, continue the interrupted task or restart it. When you perform a task for the first time (or restart it), the task always starts at an airport. This is the <b><span style=""color:red;"">starting point</span></b>, where, in many tasks, you must return to complete the task.</p>
<p>When you play in the free version – airport and the start time is drawn – this is the only random element in the game! You may not accept the draw result and draw a different starting point, but each repetition of the draw will cost you a couple of points.</p>
<p>Once you have purchased ""Starting Point"" feature you will be able to choose your starting point and start time, and you can also draw airport without loss of points. This makes it easier for you to get a better result of task because you can choose a popular airport (e.g. Amsterdam (AMS)) with a lot of connections and choose an optimal departure time. When unhappily you draw the airport at the ""end of the world"" with the nearest plane in 3 days, you may lose a lot of time... but also gain on visited sights, airports or countries! Starting point does not count for rankings – only the places to which you reach count. The starting point airport will count only when you return to this place...</p>
<p>The game starts at the departure time or any other move from the airport to another place (while you are waiting for the plane, you can explore the area).</p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">Navigation in the game</span></i></b></p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image032.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The screen in the game is divided into panels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Menu – general game options,</li>
<li>Position – your geographical location or in-game location,</li>
<li>The main panel – shows maps, basic information, checklists (e.g. schedule); you will also find buttons to continue playing here,</li>
<li>Go back – a button that allows you to return to the previously displayed page/option,</li>
<li>Auxiliary panel – shows additional information: descriptions of selected items in the main panel, description of markings on maps, selection options,</li>
<li>Score – your current score,</li>
<li>Navigation – Main panel content selection buttons,</li>
<li>Game time – current time in the game – local time in the place, time zone and day of the week; below is an ""artificial horizon"" visualization of time of day.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""center"" style=""margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image033.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-size:0.85em;"">Examples of ""artificial horizons"" with the default background colors of the application.</span></i></p>
<p>User interface consists of cards in responsive design. The location of the cards varies depending on the screen size of the device on which you play. This is a mockup only!. The final appearance of the application will be determined later, as a result of planned cooperation with the graphic designer.</p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">When do you earn points?</span></i></b></p>
<p>In the case of airports – when you get there. In the case of countries – when you leave the airport (when you are just going to another plane, the airports are treated extraterritorially – they have no assigned country or place). Points for places – when you get there. Points for sights and activities – when you finish visiting/participating.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the basic possibilities of moving in the game.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image034.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In all places, you can just wait – only move the game clock. This may be needed when you are waiting for a plane, you are waiting for a meeting, you are waiting to open a sight, etc. Clock shifts cost you only a correction of the task time.</p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">Virtual backpack</span></i></b></p>
<p>You can also use the virtual backpack and check its contents. You have souvenirs (see below) and diary there. In the diary you have information on whether you have rented a car, when and where to return it, whether you have a valid daily public transport ticket in the place where you are and notes like your planned aircraft departure time, bus departure time – in due course diary will remind you that you need to go to the airport/bus stop. In the backpack, you can also find SOLVER – a useful travel planning tool (see section Paid Facilities).</p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">When you are at the airport:</span></i></b></p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image035.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-size:0.85em;"">Sample airport connection map</span></i></p>
<p>You can wait and change to another plane. You have an up-to-date schedule, with all available flights, their prices, duration and time of arrival at other airports, including time zones. But if you plane departures after midnight or waiting for the plane is longer than 8h then you have to go to the city center, near the airport, to the hotel for the accommodation or you can visit some sights.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image036.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-size:0.85em;"">Sample timetable</span></i></p>
<p>In the user panel, you can buy the ""Flying miles"" facility, which gives you a 50% discount on the next connection. More precisely, if at the airport you only change plane – that is, you arrived and before 8 hours fly away somewhere else, you get a discount – 50% of the standard price of cheaper of these two connections. This does not apply to the ""cheap lines"" – there are no discounts! But in the meantime, you can go to the city center and get some points visiting available sights ☺ You only have to return within 8 hours...</p>
<p>You can rent a car. Prices depend on country and city. In each country there is also a different fuel price.</p>
<p>In some cities, you can buy a 24-hour public transport ticket.</p>
<p>You can go to the city center by public transport, special airport-center connection (e.g. in Shanghai by magnetic rail), taxi or rented car. All travel options have their price and duration.</p>
<p>You can go to another city or airport by rented car, taxi, bus or hitch.</p>
<p>You can ""save"" to the diary, in your virtual backpack, departure time of selected connection, you want to use after spending time in the area. Diary reminds you when you must return to the airport.</p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">When you are in the city center</span></i></b></p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image037.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-size:0.85em;"">Sample map of sights</span></i></p>
<p>Just like at the airport you can rent a car and/or buy a 24-hour public transport ticket.</p>
<p>You can use the hotel (actually, the application will tell you that the night is approaching, all the facilities for sightseeing are closed and will direct you to the hotel automatically, where you have to spend at least 8 hours). You will be charged daily for meals and accommodation depending on your actual location. In the user panel, you can purchase a ""Hotel facility"" – 25% hotel discount. The hotels are located in the city center and if you are anywhere in the city center you need 10 minutes walk to the hotel. You can also come directly to the hotel from the airport.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image038.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-size:0.85em;"">Sample list of sights available from the city center</span></i></p>
<p>You can explore the city center on foot. There is a standard time of 10 minutes to go among sights. How to visit the sight? About that later...</p>
<p>You can go to visit a sight outside the center. Various options are available – a pedestrian crossing, public transportation, taxi hire, rented car.</p>
<p>You can go to visit a sight outside the city by rented car, taxi, bus or hitch.</p>
<p>You can buy activity. Activities are not related to a particular place on the map. Treat it as an organized trip, someone will come up for you, take you to the right place, and then take you back. Activities take a certain amount of time, you have to pay for them and take place in a ""logical"" time interval (e.g. dive trips must start after dawn, a certain amount of time is required, but must end e.g. one hour after dusk; you choose the departure time yourself).</p>
<p>You can return to the airport (same options as the airport transfer to the center). But remember one rule – <b><span style=""color:red;"">ALWAYS</span></b> you must be at the airport at least 40 minutes before departure!</p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">Once you reach the sight outside the city center </span></i></b></p>
<p>You can return to the center/hotel – transport options such as the road from the center to the sight. You can do it after visiting the attractions or without visiting it – because you have a plane soon or upon arrival, it turned out that the object is already closed and you did not notice it ☺</p>
<p>In some cities apart from the center are separated ""zones"" – these are areas with several sights located close to each other, but outside the center. In such cases, you can go within the standard 10 minutes to another sight.</p>
<p>Traveling directly between sights placed not in the city center or not in the same ""zone"" is not permitted. In this case, you must first return to the center and then move on to another sight.</p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">Summary of transport options</span></i></b></p>
<p>Plane – departs according to the timetable, moves very quickly, the price is partly related to the distance traveled. Planes always lands at the airport, from which you have to go by other means of communication to the nearest city or other selected place. You need to be at the airport at least 40 minutes before the departure.</p>
<p>On foot – only for short distances, slowly but for free and you are not waiting. There is a standard time of 10 minutes to travel among the sights in the city center and in the ""zones"".</p>
<p>Airport-to-airport communication – sometimes there are dedicated connections on the airport-center-airport route, such as fast train – such connections may have a special price, they can also be accounted as other connections in the public transport system.</p>
<p>Public transport – the primary way of moving around cities. In many cities, you can also use the 24-hour ticket. With such a ticket, you can go for the duration of 24 hours after first use of the communication free of charge, otherwise, single-pass charges are charged when you get on the city bus, subway, tram. The overall average fast but cheap. For simplicity, you leave after 5 minutes of waiting.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image039.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Taxi – you can go anywhere, relatively fast, but expensive. You pay for the distance traveled. A taxi can carry between 1 and 4 passengers. You can share the cost with other passengers. Time from order to taxi arrival – 5 minutes</p>
<p>Bus – is used to travel between cities, airports, or between a city and a sight. A scheduling algorithm was created, simulating the rules of operation of real bus operators. I assume that the buses leave the city center and finish the route in the center of another city, at the airport or at a distant sight. There are courses in reverse directions, too. Cheap, slower than a rented car, you have to adjust to the schedule.</p>
<p>Rented car – you pay for a 24-hour rental in advance. You can extend your rent for another 24 hours. Usually, you have the option of standard renting with the return in the same point or more expensive options with the ability to return anywhere in the same country or even abroad. You pay the fuel costs for each km you drive – the fuel cost is charged at the return of the car. You can ride ""bus routes"", but you are not limited by schedules. You must take breaks during your trip. The rented car can take from 1 to 4 people. The fastest means of land transport, guaranteeing temporary independence. Rented car can also travel in cities at the same speed as taxis, but access to the center ""costs"" you 15 minutes to find a car park ☺</p>
<p>Hitchhikers also go on ""bus routes"", but on other terms. I think hitchhiking is everywhere popular (but I plan to research how it looks in reality in different countries – for now, it's a fresh idea and needs to be refined ☺). You can catch cars from dawn to dusk. Each time you catch a hitch for 30 minutes and then it carries you for max 1 hour.</p>
<p>Same as fast as a rented car. If you do not reach the destination within an hour, you will lose 30 minutes to catch another hitch and you will be traveling another hour. You can ride alone or with one extra person. You can hitch efficiently using souvenirs whose way of buying is described further. You can ""pay"" the driver who will chase you with a <b><span style=""color:red;"">souvenir</span></b>. Each souvenir has its own strength, which you can express in the distance you are carried by the hitch. When you catch a hitch in the afternoon and pay by a valuable souvenir, you can drive even through the night and save money on the hotel – you just fall asleep during the hitch!</p>
<p>I also plan to introduce rail connections and some water communication: ferries, boats to hire, cruisers. Ferries are partially implemented but in undisclosed form – travel time takes into account ferry time but does not generate extra travel expenses.</p>
<p>Railway connections require additional research – each country needs to be treated very individually. It would be interesting to introduce the possibility of moving TGV or another high-speed rail system, but developing a simulation of the right quality can be very time-consuming to prepare.</p>
<p>I am tempted by the option of renting airplanes – but it is more about my fascination with aviation than with the needs of the game ☺. But on the other hand, it would be possible to use small airports that are not used for day-to-day communication and facilitate getting into interesting sights located far from large airports... For now, the flight of the small plane is available as one of the type of activities.</p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">How to visit the sight?</span></i></b></p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image040.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-size:0.85em;"">An example Wikipedia page describing the tourist attraction and sightseeing options</span></i></p>
<p>Once you reach the sight, a page from Wikipedia will appear on the screen describing this sight. To earn points for visiting sight, you must have at least one interaction with this site – scroll through the page to the end, click on any photo or change the language of the page. This is done <b><span style=""color:red;"">ESPECIALLY</span></b> – the goal of the game is to learn something! I hope that your general knowledge will increase ☺</p>
<p>When you select the tour option, you will see a short animation of the elapsed time. Every 5 minutes of game time equals 1 second of animation. Visiting an example object will, in fact, last 12 to 18 seconds! Similar animations will appear during virtual travel by any means of transport.</p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">Postcards </span></i></b></p>
<p>Once you have visited the sight, before deciding where you are going, you can generate your own ""postcard"". You can use any of the Wikipedia commons pictures (copyright issues) and simply insert into picture your profile photo or other picture previously uploaded via user panel, your username and some text (from ready-made templates or at your own choice). You can change the size, location, and color of these items. The application will add a BavelTravel logo and signature to the post containing the location of the object, original signature, and picture author data (license requirements). For making a ""postcard"" you will get points and you will be able to put it in your postcard album and send it to whom you want (see User panel).</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image041.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-size:0.85em;"">Sample ""postcard""</span></i></p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">Souvenirs</span></i></b></p>
<p>When you visit sights or participate in activities in some places you can buy souvenirs. These are, of course, virtual souvenirs, they are not named, but they ""remember"" the place of their purchase. As part of the ""education"" of the game, I will try to determine what are the real souvenirs characteristic of the country and place ☺.</p>
<p>Every souvenir has a reasonable price – about 20 GLD. But souvenirs are not so easy to buy... You have to look for them. You can buy them on average every fifth tourist attraction. When you do not have a place in your virtual backpack, before you buy a new souvenir, you have to use an older one.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image042.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Each souvenir has variable strength, which depends on the distance between the place where you are located and the place of purchase of the souvenir (air distance by the orthodox – it is such information for curious ☺). What is the use of souvenirs? To ""pay"" for hitchhiking, to ""pay"" for accommodation while hitchhiking and to ""bribe"" staff to let you visit sights outside opening hours/days.☺</p>
<p>You can hitch a distance of 1/10 of its current strength, i.e. the distance from the place of purchase in kilometers. Suppose you bought a souvenir in Brazil. You are now somewhere in Europe. From the place of purchase is e.g. 8000 km, that is, you will ride hitchhiking 800 km, and if you choose the right moment of its use you will not pay the cost of accommodation – you will just sleep in the car.</p>
<p>If you want to pay for the hotel souvenir strength is converted to GLD. Souvenir value in GLD is 1/10 of its current strength. For example, if a hotel costs 200 GLD then look for a souvenir in the backpack purchased at least 2000 km from your actual location Note: souvenir cannot be paid in part, nor does it get ""rest"". So if you have to pay 200 GLD and you have a souvenir of 1500 km ""strength"" you cannot use it. When you have a souvenir of 3500 km ""strength"" using it you ""overpay"".</p>
<p>Little bribe. Example: You want to visit the museum on Monday and it turns out to be closed. You can try to ""bribe"" the staff to let you in. Of course, cash does not come into play! But if the strength of your souvenir converted into GLD (as for paying for a hotel) will exceed the price of an admission +20 GLD you will be admitted to. ☺ The same applies to visiting the sight after the official closing time or before opening.</p>
<p>You do not have to remember all these conversions. The game itself will tell you if you can use a souvenir.</p>
<p>Perhaps during the development of the game or in some specific tasks, the souvenirs will be used in some other way. Remember! There is a strength in souvenirs ☺</p>
<p><b><i><span style=""font-size:1.2em;color:#00B050;"">Meetings, chat, and blog</span></i></b></p>
<p>These functionalities have already been described in previous chapters...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is the end of my description of the game. In case of doubt please ask questions. A lot of this and I could skip something...</p>
<p>There are still 2 topics:</p>
<p><b><span style=""font-size:1.5em;color:#0070C0;"">Paid facilities</span></b></p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image043.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-size:0.85em;"">Purchased facilities, terms of their validity, prices</span></i></p>
<p>Discounts on hotels and air connections have already been described. Just like choosing a starting point.</p>
<p>Another facility is obvious nowadays – no ads. By displaying ads, app users can play for free. But many are upset. Hence, this possibility.</p>
<p>And the latest facility – useful for more advanced players in the planning of travel. I called them NEXT HOP. It allows you to view, without moving from the airport, flight schedules of another airport connected with current airport. This allows you to check, for example, what time you have to fly from the ""actual"" airport, to catch another plane at another airport.</p>
<p>If you purchase the NEXT HOP, you will find in your backpack an additional, very useful route planning tool – SOLVER. This tool can answer you where is the best place to get to the place you are looking for. You can also set the day and time when you want to get there. You can use SOLVER at any time and ask for access to any location – you can search for a country, airport, city, sight. SOLVER also allows you to search for the nearest places where selected type of activity or sight category is available. Finally, it shows the location of various ""useful"" places to perform a specific task.</p>
<p>You can buy one facility or a bundle of all facilities for one month. Of course, I recommend buying the bundle ☺</p>
<p>Facilities can be paid from any PayPal account (such as parents, adult friends)</p>
<p>Facilities may change during game development. But you will <b><span style=""color:red;"">always</span></b> be able to buy a bundle of all the facilities for a fixed price of <b><span style=""color:red;"">$4.99 per month</span></b>. I only reserve the possibility of changing the price in the case of major currency market changes or changes in the PayPal commissions.</p>
<p><b><span style=""font-size:1.5em;color:#0070C0;"">Prizes</span></b></p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://baveltravel.com/img/image044.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Those who achieve the best results in the given task will be rewarded. Prizes may vary in each task.</p>
<p>Generally, for the best result in a given task or some best results (2nd and 3rd place, the top ten) financial awards are provided (or material prizes from the sponsors). The prize pool is given for each task in the tasks list. More detailed information can be found in the task description.</p>
<p>The ""+"" of the prize amount means that the prize will increase as the number of players performing the given task increases (both free and paid). Therefore, it is beneficial of the players i<b><span style=""color:red;"">to invite friends to play</span></b>, for example through social networking sites.</p>
<p><b><span style=""color:red;"">Important note!</span></b> Prizes are given as gross amounts, which does not include any applicable taxes in your country and money transfer costs. Depending on the user's residence, taxes can be settled automatically or the user will receive a tax-deductible email. In most countries, there are certain amounts of tax-free winnings. Usually, such amounts are around $500, so there should not be a problem with settling typical winnings<b><span style=""color:red;"">. Financial awards can only be received by adults who have an active PayPal account registered for the same email address as given when registering for the game!</span></b></p>
<p>In addition, the best players get ""status rewards"" – public information about the user in the form of icons and descriptions, for results in a given task:</p>
<ul>
<li>1, 2, 3 places</li>
<li>Placement in the top 10</li>
<li>Placement in the top 100</li>
<li>Placement in the first 10% of players</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, depending on the number of players in a given task, you can get a free ""starter pack"" – the same as a new player signing up. This package can be used by itself or given to any user of the game.</p>
<p>At the end of each month, the user status is updated. As I have written before, I plan to introduce the scarfs/bandanas as status symbols. Obtaining a globetrotter or higher status will be associated with a gift in the form of a corresponding scarf surface-mailed to a previously set e-mail physical address. <b><span style=""color:red;"">Minors are also involved</span></b>.</p>
<p>There are also status icons for reaching each sight category and type of activity. It's a bit like picking scout skills. <span style=""font-family:Wingdings;"">J</span></p>

Interested? Time to start your virtual journey...
 

May 1, 2020, Bamako, Mali
In the morning a mop guy woke me up. He started to poke me and speak something in his own way. What language does he speak? I understood only ""aller, aller"", what in French means go or faster. Fortunately, his gestures cleared my doubts. I jumped out of the uncomfortable plastic bench and fell nearly on the wet floor tangled in the straps of my own backpack.
It turned out that I was at the airport in Bamako, in Mali and I do not really remember how I got here. As I left outside, I was struck by the heat. Macabre! I am in Africa only a few days and my body has not yet adjusted to the heat. I'm wet all the time, the sun is so sharp, even the dark sunglasses does not help much, and on my skin, I feel as if someone is stabbing a million thin pins in it. Well, I have to survive, somehow. I have some memory loss, maybe it's the case of a solar stroke?

 
It's a fragment of a traveler's diary that describes one day of his hero's journey. It would be nice to be able to write such a relationship of your own experiences...
Traveling is one of our most common dreams, we like to talk about travel and share experiences.But...
What do you think about traveling?
 When we think of an influx of extra cash (e.g., banished on a lottery, higher than the usual bonus, the completion of a long work), travels are almost always being on our list of planned expenses. When we are overworked, we would mostly like to go somewhere. We often want to visit ""warm countries"", we also dream of traveling around the world. Or maybe a short break in Rome, to see how people lived in the times of the emperors and a quick look at the Vatican.
 

It usually ends with a trip to the hotel e.g. in Greece and laze on the beach for a week or two. More active travel remains in the sphere of dreams because:


They cost too much and just exceed your financial capacity...
If we have money, we have no time...
It would be nice to fly somewhere far away, but we are afraid to fly...
We do not have anyone to go with...
We do not speak foreign languages...
We do not know the customs of the people in the countries we want to visit... We do not want to be ridiculous in the eyes of the natives...
We fear diseases, thefts, robberies, terrorists...
We do not like touts, beggars... We do not like to be hounded and forced to get rid of money...
We do not really know what and where we can see and generally how to spend time...
We are afraid that we will be able to handle this...

Only obstacles...
Let me show up at this place (a middle-aged guy, who has seen something in his life and knows a bit, from not so rich (in terms of available funds) European country), with the concept of an unusual online game ""BavelTravel"" that allows you to virtually travel around the world without these obstacles. 
This is not a real journey but its high fidelity simulation. but:


 Forget about costs – you play completely free. You can buy some facilities to increase your chances for better result (up to $4.99 per month).
No doubt you will find some time. You can break the game any time and then continue from the break point.
You fly virtually, so fear disappears. The effect of clogged ears and time shift too.
To play the game you only need an Internet connection and web browser. You are competing with other players of the game. You can even meet them virtually and travel together.
You only need basic knowledge of English. You can use internet translator. During the game you will see pages from Wikipedia that describes visited places – you can change the language there.
You do not need knowledge of customs. You will find interesting trivia about a given country or place.
I warn you. You can fall into the habit of traveling! It's a very serious illness! ☺
Costs only in virtual money.
The game has big educational value. By playing, you will learn a lot about the most interesting places to visit all over the world, what you can use in real journeys.
Surely you can manage! You can only win, even a real prize (mostly cash).

 
What is it all about?
 You can travel to more than 2500 airports in all countries and territories around the world. You can choose air connections from more than half a milion flights! You can also use public transport, taxis, buses, ferries, you can rent a car or even hitchhike. You can visit more than 8,000 places (cities, islands, nature reserves, etc.) and see over 20,000 sights (historical monuments, natural wonders, amusement parks, etc.) – in several dozens of categories or take advantage of the available activities (several dozens of types), e.g. diving, downhill typing, swimming with dolphins, climbing, etc.
The goal is to get as many points as possible in the varying monthly tasks. ""+"" points are: visited countries, airports, places, sights and their categories, activities and their types, online meetings with other users of the application, creating electronic ""postcards"", completing tasks, distance traveled. The number of points decreases the amount of money spent and the duration of the task (not the real time – you can play as long as you want, but the ""game time"" associated with the real time spent on given place in the real world).
The whole game is based on the most real information! All the elements of the game are real – you are traveling through really existing countries, airports, places and visit real tourist attractions. You need a real amount of time and money.
What gives you points?
Each element of the game gives you different amounts of points.
The point value of the visited country is related to the ease of arriving in a given country. You will get more points for visiting Kiribati or Chad, than for visiting France or USA.
Similarly, with airports – big Fumicino Airport near Rome will give you fewer points than any local airport, e.g. in Colombia.
 In the case of places, sights and activities, the opposite principle applies –more familiar places gives you more points
Places and sights were chosen from publicly available information. The most important sources include:

UNESCO World Heritage List,
Hilmans list – 1000 of the most worth a visit places in the world,
Recommended places from tourist portals such as Trip Advisor, Lonely Planet and more.

 Activities also have their scoring algorithm – for example, more points you will get for diving on a known Caribbean coral reef than at a swimming pool in a big city. In general, the amount of activity points depends on the popularity of the place.
For the categories of sights and types of activities, you get a fixed amount of points of each and in addition ""stamps"" to the status resembling scout skills.
You will also get a fixed amount of points for ""meeting"" with another player. This is the only ""unreal"" element of the game, it reminds to read in mind and travel in time ☺. You can look at where a different player is at a given moment, but on his ""game clock"" it will probably be a different date and time. To meet, you have to ""wait"" for the player in our game time until he arrives at that time or asks him to wait for you.
 
It's like a multidimensional world, in which every player ""lives"" in another dimension/time! Futuristic!. Believe me, in the game it is simpler than my explanation.☺ Meetings with players can be the beginning of a shared journey. You can reduce costs (you can share rooms in hotels, share costs of car renting and taxi), and gain more points (you can use more experience of other players).
Generally, in the game, points for a given element of the trip can only be obtained once. This means that revisiting a given site does not give you additional points.
Everything costs... virtual money
 Traveling costs money and time. In the game I introduced virtual money – Goldies (abbreviated GLD). All prices are in GLD. 1 GLD is about ¼ USD. Why such a value? It allows practically not to use fractional parts. All prices are rounded to 1 GLD.
Admission prices to sights (as well as their opening hours) are based on data from the Internet. Airline tickets prices are based partly on real prices (including ""low cost"" connections) as well as the results of statistical surveys (price per passenger per kilometer for an airline). However, I do not take into account the fact of the possibility of buying cheaper tickets in advance – in the game we pay for the ticket just before departure! Prices for accommodation, meals, car rental, taxis, public transportation, buses, etc. are based on the country or city statistical data.
In most tasks you have unlimited money – but you count how much you spent. However, there are tasks with a limited amount of funds. This kind of task ends when you spend the last GLD.
 The journey time is also based on reality. This applies to air connections and to travel times by other means of communication. Also, the time of the sightseeing is also real – the minimum amount of time you have to spend on the sight is counted. Sometimes it goes wrong with reality – for example, to ""beach"" in the game, you have to spend 1 hour on it, but in reality, if the beach is beautiful, the weather is great, the company is cool, we will be happy to spend a few hours there. Time is important because it reduces the number of points earned. Some of the tasks are ""sprinters tasks"", where time has a big impact on the final result.
Types of tasks
Tasks can be constructed in many ways. In general, there is a form of movement in each task. Each has a clearly defined purpose. All the ways to earn points are also available.
But the score in each task may be counted differently. All game elements gives points. Usually, most of the game elements have a standard score. This can be defined as the multiplier x 1. In sprint-like tasks, the overall score of the game is more affected by time – it has an exemplary x 5 multiplier with respect to the standard. For tasks that involve visiting a mandatory list of sights, the multiplier x 5 is used for visiting exactly those sights. Other sights are also counted towards the result but with a multiplier of x 1 or even lower. In tasks with limited funds multiplier x 5 is used for the amount of money spent. In tasks where you have to return to the starting point, for the completion of the task, usually the final result is multiplied by 2...
Changing the ways of counting points and ""mandatory"" places to visit can create virtually unlimited number of different tasks.
Descriptions of tasks introduces the user to a situation, start a story, that the user will continue performing the task. A simple example. The task is to visit Buenos Aires. The description of the task may look like this:<
I like to watch music movies since I remember. I admire the artistry of singers and dancers in them. I would also like to move on the stage, to take on various characters... I went dancing classes, but I thought classical dances was not for me. In modern films, most popular are hip-hop, modern dance, popping, etc. Waltz, foxtrot are out-of-date ... But lately, I changed my mind. I saw the movie ""Moulin Rouge"" and fell in love with the Argentine tango. Those emotions, until my cries passed my back as I saw the dance to ""Roxanne""... This dancer, as he made his partner... just ""world championship"" ;). I decided – I want to dance the Argentine tango. I immediately started to search for courses, but in my city, they teach only classical tango... Small research – the ""capital"" of Argentine tango is, as expected, Buenos Aires. There are two-week courses taught in English. I'm going! I will be there a lot of time, classes take 2-3 hours a day, so by the way I'm going to explore a bit. Or maybe we'll meet there and go out together? And lessons will be more fun... I'm leaving next week...
An additional element in this task is a need to come to one of the dance schools in Buenos Aires at a specific time each day... Each ""lesson learned"" will give you extra points.
Sponsored and user tasks
Tasks can be constructed by a team of people serving the game (today it is a single man team ☺), these can be user tasks (the blog is the place where I invite you to build tasks) or sponsored tasks. The scoring rules are always tailored to the nature of the task. There are also extra points of unusual things to do
SPONSORS WELCOMEJ.
Let's assume that the task sponsor is a company that owns hotels in many places around the world. The task may consist in visiting hotels from the sponsor's network. For example, to complete the task player must visit the official websites of the hotels and make a ""postcard"" from pictures on this page or read materials from a sponsor prepared especially for the game and pass a simple quiz. Virtual accommodation in such a hotel can be virtually free and will give players extra points.
 Another idea of a sponsored task may be, for example, doing virtual shopping in a sponsor's store chain. Suppose it is a clothing company and you want to complete some clothing (for example for a young woman), and the difficulty will be that shoes can only be bought in one group of stores with different locations, another group of shops will offer underwear and yet another coat, etc.
It is possible to construct various tasks. The only condition is that the task action MUST be located in real places in the world! The locations of the sponsors' shops, in the example above, must correspond to their actual locations, but the assortment to buy does not have to be exactly the same.
Each user can present his concept of the task. The most interesting tasks will be published in tasks list with the annotation of originator. I invite you to cooperation!
 
And Now for Something Completely Different!
Why is the game called BavelTravel?
The simplest answer – the baveltravel.com domain was available ☺
But that's not true – I was looking for a name for the game that would be associated with travel. At first, it was ""Incredible Journeys"", but it turned out that there are already web pages with addresses containing this name and I did not know how it should be correctly pronounced in English ☺. I wanted the name of the game to be associated with travel and then ""accidentally"" saw a video of Katy Perry – ""Chained To The Rhythm"" (see YouTube). Katy pronounces the words ""bubble"" and ""trouble"" in the very interesting way (and an amusement park, especially roller coaster makes an impression ☺).

It inspired me to come up with a similarly named ""Babel Travel"" – the associations are OK – travels and tower of Babel – that is the confusion of languages. But babel is a service/language learning software, occupied website... I started rummaging through the net... and I found ☺ – bavel means babel in ancient Hebrew language!
 And so was the name of the game and the initial logo version, a little like a pin – it can be a marker on the map.
Why I need crowdfunding?
The concept of this type of game, with cool playability and educational values, was born 15 years ago when I worked on inventing games, mainly tabletop games. Even one of that games is suitable for publication, but I ran out of funds... L. I recently released it for free, in the form of a PDF file with game supplies for printing and scissors cuttings. I will mention here my new idea – a platform for publishing various types of our ""creativity"" in the form of free PDFs – the working name ""pdfidea"". Maybe details will be presented in future on Indiegogo ☺ This project is in the preliminary stage now.
I have been working on BavelTravel for a year and a half! Most of the time takes the creation of various databases related to traveling.
The creation of database of more than half a million flights took several months... But it's finished. It is based on real connections from mid-2016. I analyzed the traffic of over 21,000 commercial aircraft from over 700 airlines!. Of course, real airline connections are changing very often, schedules are associated with the seasonality, but for the purposes of the game, such a database is completely sufficient.
The most laborious database of tourist attractions and activities is almost finished. I estimate that ¾ work has already been done. I need about 2 months to finish it.
There is also a database of multi-day tours – another attraction of the game. It is waiting for integration with the tourist attractions and will be added to the next version of the game.
Similarly, finished cruise lines and ferry connections databases will be added in the future. I'm still working on one-day-trips database.
There is a question about software and graphics. These elements need your support! I need funds to hire a client-server application programmer with knowledge of Python, Django, SQL, JavaScript, Ajax, JQuery, responsive web pages and a few other tools. Theoretically, I can write the software myself (I have 30 years of experience in this field) but it will take a long time.
The graphic designer is the second indispensable person to cooperate with. As you continue reading, you will see preliminary page designs. As mockups such graphics are sufficient, but to the final version is still far away. I have a few ideas about dynamic, attractive user interface but I need someone to do it.
Speaking of ""music"" today's state of work on the graphics can be described as composition almost ready, but I still have to write down instruments, add a few solos and other decorations ☺. As instruments, I understand computers, tablets, smartphones, etc. And as decorators – the choice of colors, fonts, animations, navigation techniques. Here is work for graphic designer.
Assuming gathering $10,000 I plan to finish the project until June/July break of 2018, the beta version should be available at baveltravel.com in early spring. More money will accelerate the development of the app and increase its visual quality. There will also be additional bonuses for the users I'm referring to later.
An unsuccessful attempt to raise funds will not end the application. However, it will significantly increase the time it takes to build it. I will not be able to hire co-workers... so the graphics page will suffer... Working on this application gives me a lot of satisfaction, I consult my ideas with friends and strangers from different backgrounds. The ""moral"" support, what I get from it, confirms my belief in the ""value"" of this project.
 
I hope you enjoyed my presentation. Thank you for your attention, I apologize for the language mistakes (I'm not from an English-speaking country) and please remember to support the project ☺
I will be happy to answer any questions you may have to help your decision to support.
I invite you to a virtual tour of the world! Soon...
 
If you want to know how to play BavelTravel read below.
 
How to play BavelTravel?
Log in
Once you have entered www.baveltravel.com for the first time, you need to create an account with your email address. the username and the password. You can also log in via Facebook.
You will be asked to read and accept the Terms of Service and agree to share some of your data with other application users (username, country of residence, status in the game, profile photo, postcards). No data will be shared outside the game users community!
If you answer a few questions: a country where you live, birth year, sex, or these data will be available on your Facebook account you will be given a ""starter pack"" with all game play facilities (except one banner ad at the top of the window) for 7 days. You can also optionally change/load a profile photo and a photo used to create ""electronic postcards.""
The next entry requires only standard logging.
Blog
Once logged in, you may see a blog page with basic information for players with recent changes in the game. This can include information such as the appearance of new tasks, the results of tasks from last month, the introduction of new opportunities in the game.
You can access the blog any time during the game – you will find various tips, answers to questions and you can also express your own opinion about the game and the articles there.
Tasks list
Then you go to the page with current tasks. Tasks are generally changed every month on the 1st day of each month. Other periods of activity may also be available (e.g. for tasks related to current events in the real world).

Sample tasks list
On the screen you will see current tasks to choose from, with basic information: task name, difficulty level, predicted rewards, number of players. You will also find information on whether this is a sponsored task or a user task.
The difficulty of the task is determined by the opinion of the players.
The new task has an ""unknown""  difficulty at the beginning. Each player after completing the task is asked to determine his difficulty scale:

 easy
 rather easy
 average
 rather difficult
 difficult
 hard

The current difficulty of the task is determined by these subjective opinions. The opinions of advanced players (higher status) is more important than the beginners opinions.
You will find out about the award system later...
Selecting a task
Selecting a task from the tasks list will take you go to the current task window. You will find here all information about the terms of the task, the rules of his scoring, or the secondary maps and your task history.
Sample task conditions:

Task: 8 new wonders of the world
Goal: Visit 8 new wonders of the world in the shortest possible time and return to the starting airport
Start: Any airport in the world, any day and time.
List of mandatory sights to visit:

Great Wall of China, Beijing +, China
Petra, Wadi Musa +, Jordan
Statue of Christ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Machu Picchu, Cusco +, Peru
Chichen Itza, Merida +, Mexico
Colosseum, Rome, Italy
Taj Mahal, Agra, India
Great Pyramids of Giza, Cairo +, Egypt


Note: A ""+"" sign means that the sight is located near the place.
Sample scoring rules:

Countries: standard
Airports: standard
Places: standard
Mandatory sights: x5
Other sights: standard
Sights categories: standard
Activities: standard
Activity types: standard
Meetings: standard
Postcards: standard
Money spent: standard
Time: x5
Task completing: standard

 
After reviewing the task, you can start, continue or restart it. During the task, you can check your current detailed results and your place in the task classification. You can also see the current classification of a given task, a map showing the places visited and to visit, the location of other players online.

Sample appearance of the current task page 
Warning! User can perform each task any number of times, but only the best result will be saved in the task history. The best result will also affect the total number of visited countries, airports, places, sights, activities, categories of sights and types of activities – that is, the values accumulated from all user completed tasks affecting its status in the game.
User panel
At any time by clicking on the username, you can access the user panel, where you can see your status, achievements (tasks history, rankings, best results). You can also log out and change the user. Here you can also change some parameters of your account – for example, change your profile picture.

The countries visited by the user in all the tasks in which he participated and his status.
In the user panel, you can also see what you have purchased, the expiration date and purchase new facilities... Generally, payments can be made through PayPal. Financial prizes are transferred to the user through PayPal as well.
From the user panel, you can manage postcards made during game play – edit them, change their status from public to private and vice versa. You can also send postcards in the form of posts on Facebook or finished JPG images via e-mails, instant messengers, other social networking sites.
Some of the information contained in this panel is available to other users via chat (achievements in the game, a map of visited countries, public postcards, profile picture, a country you represent).
In the user panel, you will also find your unique link to send to friends as a game invitation. Inviting friends to play affects the prize pool (see Prizes section). In addition, for successful invitations to every 10 people (successful invitation = new user visit www.baveltravel.com with your unique link sent to him, sign up and start doing any task) you will get a free "" starter pack"" – the same as when registering to the game. You can use this package yourself or transfer it to another player.
Statuses
There are no classic levels in this game. The status of the user is determined by a number of visited countries for all tasks in which the user participated. The remaining parameters (number of completed tasks, visited airports, places, etc.) are included in the overall rating of the users with the same number of visited countries. Statuses are updated with the appearance of new tasks on the first day of the month.
Depending on the number of countries visited, users receive statuses according to the scheme:


Visited countries
Status
Status symbol
 


1-25
Rookie
yellow scarf



26-50
Traveler
red scarf



51-100
Guide
green scarf



101-150
Globetrotter
blue scarf



151-200
Conqueror
brown scarf



201+
Master
black scarf



I plan the possibility to buy (for the lowest levels)/receive free (for higher levels – from the globetrotter up) scarfs in status color with logo and game name. However, this requires additional organizational activities – such as ordering appropriate scarfs and organizing cheap shipping. However, I need information of the needs, which will come out only after the game release. If my campaign collects 200% of the required founds then scarfs will be for sure and will be given to the donors first.
Let's return to the tasks.
Performing tasks
You can start the task, continue the interrupted task or restart it. When you perform a task for the first time (or restart it), the task always starts at an airport. This is the starting point, where, in many tasks, you must return to complete the task.
When you play in the free version – airport and the start time is drawn – this is the only random element in the game! You may not accept the draw result and draw a different starting point, but each repetition of the draw will cost you a couple of points.
Once you have purchased ""Starting Point"" feature you will be able to choose your starting point and start time, and you can also draw airport without loss of points. This makes it easier for you to get a better result of task because you can choose a popular airport (e.g. Amsterdam (AMS)) with a lot of connections and choose an optimal departure time. When unhappily you draw the airport at the ""end of the world"" with the nearest plane in 3 days, you may lose a lot of time... but also gain on visited sights, airports or countries! Starting point does not count for rankings – only the places to which you reach count. The starting point airport will count only when you return to this place...
The game starts at the departure time or any other move from the airport to another place (while you are waiting for the plane, you can explore the area).
Navigation in the game

The screen in the game is divided into panels:

Menu – general game options,
Position – your geographical location or in-game location,
The main panel – shows maps, basic information, checklists (e.g. schedule); you will also find buttons to continue playing here,
Go back – a button that allows you to return to the previously displayed page/option,
Auxiliary panel – shows additional information: descriptions of selected items in the main panel, description of markings on maps, selection options,
Score – your current score,
Navigation – Main panel content selection buttons,
Game time – current time in the game – local time in the place, time zone and day of the week; below is an ""artificial horizon"" visualization of time of day.


Examples of ""artificial horizons"" with the default background colors of the application.
User interface consists of cards in responsive design. The location of the cards varies depending on the screen size of the device on which you play. This is a mockup only!. The final appearance of the application will be determined later, as a result of planned cooperation with the graphic designer.
When do you earn points?
In the case of airports – when you get there. In the case of countries – when you leave the airport (when you are just going to another plane, the airports are treated extraterritorially – they have no assigned country or place). Points for places – when you get there. Points for sights and activities – when you finish visiting/participating.
The diagram below shows the basic possibilities of moving in the game.

In all places, you can just wait – only move the game clock. This may be needed when you are waiting for a plane, you are waiting for a meeting, you are waiting to open a sight, etc. Clock shifts cost you only a correction of the task time.
Virtual backpack
You can also use the virtual backpack and check its contents. You have souvenirs (see below) and diary there. In the diary you have information on whether you have rented a car, when and where to return it, whether you have a valid daily public transport ticket in the place where you are and notes like your planned aircraft departure time, bus departure time – in due course diary will remind you that you need to go to the airport/bus stop. In the backpack, you can also find SOLVER – a useful travel planning tool (see section Paid Facilities).
When you are at the airport:

Sample airport connection map
You can wait and change to another plane. You have an up-to-date schedule, with all available flights, their prices, duration and time of arrival at other airports, including time zones. But if you plane departures after midnight or waiting for the plane is longer than 8h then you have to go to the city center, near the airport, to the hotel for the accommodation or you can visit some sights.

Sample timetable
In the user panel, you can buy the ""Flying miles"" facility, which gives you a 50% discount on the next connection. More precisely, if at the airport you only change plane – that is, you arrived and before 8 hours fly away somewhere else, you get a discount – 50% of the standard price of cheaper of these two connections. This does not apply to the ""cheap lines"" – there are no discounts! But in the meantime, you can go to the city center and get some points visiting available sights ☺ You only have to return within 8 hours...
You can rent a car. Prices depend on country and city. In each country there is also a different fuel price.
In some cities, you can buy a 24-hour public transport ticket.
You can go to the city center by public transport, special airport-center connection (e.g. in Shanghai by magnetic rail), taxi or rented car. All travel options have their price and duration.
You can go to another city or airport by rented car, taxi, bus or hitch.
You can ""save"" to the diary, in your virtual backpack, departure time of selected connection, you want to use after spending time in the area. Diary reminds you when you must return to the airport.
When you are in the city center

Sample map of sights
Just like at the airport you can rent a car and/or buy a 24-hour public transport ticket.
You can use the hotel (actually, the application will tell you that the night is approaching, all the facilities for sightseeing are closed and will direct you to the hotel automatically, where you have to spend at least 8 hours). You will be charged daily for meals and accommodation depending on your actual location. In the user panel, you can purchase a ""Hotel facility"" – 25% hotel discount. The hotels are located in the city center and if you are anywhere in the city center you need 10 minutes walk to the hotel. You can also come directly to the hotel from the airport.

Sample list of sights available from the city center
You can explore the city center on foot. There is a standard time of 10 minutes to go among sights. How to visit the sight? About that later...
You can go to visit a sight outside the center. Various options are available – a pedestrian crossing, public transportation, taxi hire, rented car.
You can go to visit a sight outside the city by rented car, taxi, bus or hitch.
You can buy activity. Activities are not related to a particular place on the map. Treat it as an organized trip, someone will come up for you, take you to the right place, and then take you back. Activities take a certain amount of time, you have to pay for them and take place in a ""logical"" time interval (e.g. dive trips must start after dawn, a certain amount of time is required, but must end e.g. one hour after dusk; you choose the departure time yourself).
You can return to the airport (same options as the airport transfer to the center). But remember one rule – ALWAYS you must be at the airport at least 40 minutes before departure!
Once you reach the sight outside the city center 
You can return to the center/hotel – transport options such as the road from the center to the sight. You can do it after visiting the attractions or without visiting it – because you have a plane soon or upon arrival, it turned out that the object is already closed and you did not notice it ☺
In some cities apart from the center are separated ""zones"" – these are areas with several sights located close to each other, but outside the center. In such cases, you can go within the standard 10 minutes to another sight.
Traveling directly between sights placed not in the city center or not in the same ""zone"" is not permitted. In this case, you must first return to the center and then move on to another sight.
Summary of transport options
Plane – departs according to the timetable, moves very quickly, the price is partly related to the distance traveled. Planes always lands at the airport, from which you have to go by other means of communication to the nearest city or other selected place. You need to be at the airport at least 40 minutes before the departure.
On foot – only for short distances, slowly but for free and you are not waiting. There is a standard time of 10 minutes to travel among the sights in the city center and in the ""zones"".
Airport-to-airport communication – sometimes there are dedicated connections on the airport-center-airport route, such as fast train – such connections may have a special price, they can also be accounted as other connections in the public transport system.
Public transport – the primary way of moving around cities. In many cities, you can also use the 24-hour ticket. With such a ticket, you can go for the duration of 24 hours after first use of the communication free of charge, otherwise, single-pass charges are charged when you get on the city bus, subway, tram. The overall average fast but cheap. For simplicity, you leave after 5 minutes of waiting.

Taxi – you can go anywhere, relatively fast, but expensive. You pay for the distance traveled. A taxi can carry between 1 and 4 passengers. You can share the cost with other passengers. Time from order to taxi arrival – 5 minutes
Bus – is used to travel between cities, airports, or between a city and a sight. A scheduling algorithm was created, simulating the rules of operation of real bus operators. I assume that the buses leave the city center and finish the route in the center of another city, at the airport or at a distant sight. There are courses in reverse directions, too. Cheap, slower than a rented car, you have to adjust to the schedule.
Rented car – you pay for a 24-hour rental in advance. You can extend your rent for another 24 hours. Usually, you have the option of standard renting with the return in the same point or more expensive options with the ability to return anywhere in the same country or even abroad. You pay the fuel costs for each km you drive – the fuel cost is charged at the return of the car. You can ride ""bus routes"", but you are not limited by schedules. You must take breaks during your trip. The rented car can take from 1 to 4 people. The fastest means of land transport, guaranteeing temporary independence. Rented car can also travel in cities at the same speed as taxis, but access to the center ""costs"" you 15 minutes to find a car park ☺
Hitchhikers also go on ""bus routes"", but on other terms. I think hitchhiking is everywhere popular (but I plan to research how it looks in reality in different countries – for now, it's a fresh idea and needs to be refined ☺). You can catch cars from dawn to dusk. Each time you catch a hitch for 30 minutes and then it carries you for max 1 hour.
Same as fast as a rented car. If you do not reach the destination within an hour, you will lose 30 minutes to catch another hitch and you will be traveling another hour. You can ride alone or with one extra person. You can hitch efficiently using souvenirs whose way of buying is described further. You can ""pay"" the driver who will chase you with a souvenir. Each souvenir has its own strength, which you can express in the distance you are carried by the hitch. When you catch a hitch in the afternoon and pay by a valuable souvenir, you can drive even through the night and save money on the hotel – you just fall asleep during the hitch!
I also plan to introduce rail connections and some water communication: ferries, boats to hire, cruisers. Ferries are partially implemented but in undisclosed form – travel time takes into account ferry time but does not generate extra travel expenses.
Railway connections require additional research – each country needs to be treated very individually. It would be interesting to introduce the possibility of moving TGV or another high-speed rail system, but developing a simulation of the right quality can be very time-consuming to prepare.
I am tempted by the option of renting airplanes – but it is more about my fascination with aviation than with the needs of the game ☺. But on the other hand, it would be possible to use small airports that are not used for day-to-day communication and facilitate getting into interesting sights located far from large airports... For now, the flight of the small plane is available as one of the type of activities.
How to visit the sight?

An example Wikipedia page describing the tourist attraction and sightseeing options
Once you reach the sight, a page from Wikipedia will appear on the screen describing this sight. To earn points for visiting sight, you must have at least one interaction with this site – scroll through the page to the end, click on any photo or change the language of the page. This is done ESPECIALLY – the goal of the game is to learn something! I hope that your general knowledge will increase ☺
When you select the tour option, you will see a short animation of the elapsed time. Every 5 minutes of game time equals 1 second of animation. Visiting an example object will, in fact, last 12 to 18 seconds! Similar animations will appear during virtual travel by any means of transport.
Postcards 
Once you have visited the sight, before deciding where you are going, you can generate your own ""postcard"". You can use any of the Wikipedia commons pictures (copyright issues) and simply insert into picture your profile photo or other picture previously uploaded via user panel, your username and some text (from ready-made templates or at your own choice). You can change the size, location, and color of these items. The application will add a BavelTravel logo and signature to the post containing the location of the object, original signature, and picture author data (license requirements). For making a ""postcard"" you will get points and you will be able to put it in your postcard album and send it to whom you want (see User panel).

Sample ""postcard""
Souvenirs
When you visit sights or participate in activities in some places you can buy souvenirs. These are, of course, virtual souvenirs, they are not named, but they ""remember"" the place of their purchase. As part of the ""education"" of the game, I will try to determine what are the real souvenirs characteristic of the country and place ☺.
Every souvenir has a reasonable price – about 20 GLD. But souvenirs are not so easy to buy... You have to look for them. You can buy them on average every fifth tourist attraction. When you do not have a place in your virtual backpack, before you buy a new souvenir, you have to use an older one.

Each souvenir has variable strength, which depends on the distance between the place where you are located and the place of purchase of the souvenir (air distance by the orthodox – it is such information for curious ☺). What is the use of souvenirs? To ""pay"" for hitchhiking, to ""pay"" for accommodation while hitchhiking and to ""bribe"" staff to let you visit sights outside opening hours/days.☺
You can hitch a distance of 1/10 of its current strength, i.e. the distance from the place of purchase in kilometers. Suppose you bought a souvenir in Brazil. You are now somewhere in Europe. From the place of purchase is e.g. 8000 km, that is, you will ride hitchhiking 800 km, and if you choose the right moment of its use you will not pay the cost of accommodation – you will just sleep in the car.
If you want to pay for the hotel souvenir strength is converted to GLD. Souvenir value in GLD is 1/10 of its current strength. For example, if a hotel costs 200 GLD then look for a souvenir in the backpack purchased at least 2000 km from your actual location Note: souvenir cannot be paid in part, nor does it get ""rest"". So if you have to pay 200 GLD and you have a souvenir of 1500 km ""strength"" you cannot use it. When you have a souvenir of 3500 km ""strength"" using it you ""overpay"".
Little bribe. Example: You want to visit the museum on Monday and it turns out to be closed. You can try to ""bribe"" the staff to let you in. Of course, cash does not come into play! But if the strength of your souvenir converted into GLD (as for paying for a hotel) will exceed the price of an admission +20 GLD you will be admitted to. ☺ The same applies to visiting the sight after the official closing time or before opening.
You do not have to remember all these conversions. The game itself will tell you if you can use a souvenir.
Perhaps during the development of the game or in some specific tasks, the souvenirs will be used in some other way. Remember! There is a strength in souvenirs ☺
Meetings, chat, and blog
These functionalities have already been described in previous chapters...
 
Here is the end of my description of the game. In case of doubt please ask questions. A lot of this and I could skip something...
There are still 2 topics:
Paid facilities

Purchased facilities, terms of their validity, prices
Discounts on hotels and air connections have already been described. Just like choosing a starting point.
Another facility is obvious nowadays – no ads. By displaying ads, app users can play for free. But many are upset. Hence, this possibility.
And the latest facility – useful for more advanced players in the planning of travel. I called them NEXT HOP. It allows you to view, without moving from the airport, flight schedules of another airport connected with current airport. This allows you to check, for example, what time you have to fly from the ""actual"" airport, to catch another plane at another airport.
If you purchase the NEXT HOP, you will find in your backpack an additional, very useful route planning tool – SOLVER. This tool can answer you where is the best place to get to the place you are looking for. You can also set the day and time when you want to get there. You can use SOLVER at any time and ask for access to any location – you can search for a country, airport, city, sight. SOLVER also allows you to search for the nearest places where selected type of activity or sight category is available. Finally, it shows the location of various ""useful"" places to perform a specific task.
You can buy one facility or a bundle of all facilities for one month. Of course, I recommend buying the bundle ☺
Facilities can be paid from any PayPal account (such as parents, adult friends)
Facilities may change during game development. But you will always be able to buy a bundle of all the facilities for a fixed price of $4.99 per month. I only reserve the possibility of changing the price in the case of major currency market changes or changes in the PayPal commissions.
Prizes

Those who achieve the best results in the given task will be rewarded. Prizes may vary in each task.
Generally, for the best result in a given task or some best results (2nd and 3rd place, the top ten) financial awards are provided (or material prizes from the sponsors). The prize pool is given for each task in the tasks list. More detailed information can be found in the task description.
The ""+"" of the prize amount means that the prize will increase as the number of players performing the given task increases (both free and paid). Therefore, it is beneficial of the players ito invite friends to play, for example through social networking sites.
Important note! Prizes are given as gross amounts, which does not include any applicable taxes in your country and money transfer costs. Depending on the user's residence, taxes can be settled automatically or the user will receive a tax-deductible email. In most countries, there are certain amounts of tax-free winnings. Usually, such amounts are around $500, so there should not be a problem with settling typical winnings. Financial awards can only be received by adults who have an active PayPal account registered for the same email address as given when registering for the game!
In addition, the best players get ""status rewards"" – public information about the user in the form of icons and descriptions, for results in a given task:

1, 2, 3 places
Placement in the top 10
Placement in the top 100
Placement in the first 10% of players

In addition, depending on the number of players in a given task, you can get a free ""starter pack"" – the same as a new player signing up. This package can be used by itself or given to any user of the game.
At the end of each month, the user status is updated. As I have written before, I plan to introduce the scarfs/bandanas as status symbols. Obtaining a globetrotter or higher status will be associated with a gift in the form of a corresponding scarf surface-mailed to a previously set e-mail physical address. Minors are also involved.
There are also status icons for reaching each sight category and type of activity. It's a bit like picking scout skills. J

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
</div><p>GoldenChip is a gaming platform that shares its profit and is based on the EOS.IO blockchain. The blockchain ecosystem has enabled us to form a new gambling platform that provides a safe, trustworthy and unlimited gambling system. All games found on the platform are extremely fair because they are maintained by the blockchain. The GCHIP tokens provide their holders with the dividends obtained from the game profits on the platform. At the same time due to the cross-platform, users can play at any time and from any device.</p><p>The team of GoldenChip has a large experience of working as a developer of mobile games on Web, IOS, and Android on the blockchain there are many DApps, but we are sure that our expertise in developing games, operatingand marketing them will enable us to become market leaders.</p><p> </p><p><strong>1. ​Introduction</strong></p><p>Our team started its professional activity in developing games in 2010. In 2012 the whole industry started being involved into the mobile world. Therefore, we started developing mobile games, too. We performed all actions – including design, development, operation and marketing – on our own without attracting any third parties. It allowed us to obtain perfect gaming experience. We have learnt how to attract users and publicity, how to maintain users, and how to prolong the game popularity. It took us only several years to achieve more than 10 million downloads and gain above 1 million users who actively played our games.</p><p>Our deep involvement in the cryptocurrency industry has started since 2015. Certainly, it set some challenges, but at the same time it allowed us looking at our activity in a new and unprejudiced way. We started developing unique games that made us different from our competitors. Moreover, it allowed us to become absolute market leaders. Step by step we launched our own mining pool and thus made our own contribution to the network. We fixed daemon bugs and provided feedback. The industry was growing, so were we. We learnt how to add something exciting and entirely new to the network. We based our gaming philosophy on three presumptions: firstly, people love games, secondly, they prefer simple games and avoid complexity, and thirdly, they do not like high cost and high risks. Thanks to the EOS.IO blockchain, we have a perfect platform where we can easily achieve our goals. As soon as the blockchainwas launched, our team began to plan and find the best method to develop on it. The code of implementing the node was read, our own endpoints were built, and as a result a sustainable and safe network on the cloud was provided. Each step was taken as carefully as possible until the whole blockchain was perfectly understood. At last, our first project – <strong>GoldenChip</strong> – was launched.</p><p>The EOS.IO blockchain is the basis of GoldenChip. It offers a reliable, profitable and top-quality gambling expertise on the Internet. It involves the principles of not only traditional online gambling platforms, but also online cryptocurrency casinos. At the same time it has not the disadvantages of those above, including high commission fees, slow depositing and withdrawing, and lack of reliability. Our company has the aim to become the largest cryptocurrency gambling platform. We know that we can achieve this goal only by sharing our own profits with holders of our tokens. Thus, we invite every user to join us and help us to increase our community. We are sure that in addition to our own team and our offer, these are users who create the value. Joining us, you contribute to working out a perfect solution on developing and marketing that is sure to benefit each owner of our tokens.</p><p> </p><p><strong>2. Market Analysis</strong></p><p><strong>2.1 General Data</strong></p><p>The following activities are thought to be online gambling:</p><ul>
<li>casino games,</li>
<li>bingo,</li>
<li>lotteries,</li>
<li>sports betting</li>
<li>poker.</li>
</ul><p>The largest share of the market is made by sports betting and casino games. The latter include such activities as slot machines, dice and roulette. According to some forecasts, by 2022 online gambling will have achieved USD 59.79 billion.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553769080/d9bccnikwxpav5apptjg.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Fig. 1. Global Market of Gambling from 2009 to 2015, Including Forecasts for 2016-2020</strong></p><p><strong><a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/270728/market-volume-of-online-gaming-worldwide/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.statista.com/statistics/270728/market-volume-of-online-gaming-worldwide/</a></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>2.2 ChallengesTraditional Casinos Face</strong></p><p>This is not a secret that traditional casinos face a lot of difficulties and shortcomingsthat complicate the attraction of new users. We are sure that the operation performed on the EOS.IO blockchain will make it possible to avoidthe above problems.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Challenge 1. Tokens are insignificant</u></strong></p><p>In some traditional casinos tokens are issued for their users, but the majority of them are insignificant because they are not circulated and there are no loyal users. Sometimes issuers pump and dump their tokens to increase the price by making recommendations that are based on incorrect, false or greatly dramatized statements. Besides, some issuers even betray the users’ confidence as soon as they issue the ICO.</p><p>In order to issue the most trustable tokens, our team made the decision to launch the platform. It showed our hard work at developing and marketing for the game success. Our tokens are actively circulating on the exchange and market, and we entirely control them. Moreover, each token owner can fully control them by auditing how coins are spent. We share our profits, and thus we make up a foundation value for all coins. It means that the value will never become zero. When tokens are issued by the users who play the game, it means that we have sufficient profit and it will never be zero. Only a little part of the tokens is reserved for ourselves. It means that it never stops developing because we personally have a great interest in the token success and value. We conducted a small and short-term token sale. Our task was to prove that we do not scam or deceive our users. All we want is to start the project that has enough budget to let us achieve our success.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Challenge 2: </u></strong><strong><u>Slow withdrawals and deposits</u></strong></p><p>The players attending ordinary casinos have to change chips or credit a definite amount of money. However, they often wait for a long period time to get a cashback. The progress itself is too slow. In fact, it is far from reliable and the results are not too good. These are the most common issues:</p><ol>
<li>It is easy to deposit money but it is difficult to withdraw it.</li>
<li>The balance is displayed incorrectly.</li>
<li>Depositing and withdrawing are slow. It may take users up to several hours to complete the action.</li>
<li>Audit is not provided.</li>
<li>New users are not trusted.</li>
<li>High withdrawal fees are demanded.</li>
</ol><p>To solve these problems, any EOS-based tokens are accepted for our games. EOS enables users toapply their coins without making any deposits and/or withdrawals. Instant payments and payoutsonly provefull confidence and safety. It also diminishes the risk of bugs. The blockchain records all transactions. It means that all records can be easily audited by any user at any time.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Challenge 3: Attacks of bots</u></strong></p><p>Attacks of bots are the most ordinary attack an online casino may suffer. Especially in relation to smart contracts, users can push actions directly to the blockchain without using the gaming platform. Besides, creating bots, it is possible to get benefits from every event organized by us. Of course, it is not fair in relation to any other players, when the majority of the rewards are taken by attacker. This is not our aim.</p><p>To solve this problem and in general to eliminate this situation, our team will implement a special mechanism on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">checking sums</a> to make sure that all players are pushing actions on our platform. It is hard for attackers to forge the request because the checksum mechanism is calculated in private. It requires a lot of work to understand and get the answer. This is how we can decrease the number of bots and protect the rights of all our users.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Challenge 4: Almost unsecure</u></strong></p><p>Traditional online casinos tend to collect personal information. Users are required to providetheir passport number, details of bank accounts, real name, etc. for verification and payouts. In spite of the fact that all these details are sensitive, they are stored in unsafe servers that can be easily accessed by hackers. As a result, some valuable information can leak.</p><p>These and other associated problems can be eliminated by using the EOS Scatter wallet. Users can access our platform by signing up and logging in through Scatter. The only data you need to use is your own device. It is up to the user whether to provide or hide his or her private information.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Challenge 5: The random function is unsafe</u></strong></p><p>In case the random function is unwell designed, it can be vulnerable, and hackers can easily break it. Random is thought to be the most difficult part on modern computers. This is not a secret that some developers do not have enough expertise to form true random values.</p><p>These are some frequent mistakes made by developers:</p><p>1. The use of easily estimated seed for random,</p><p>2. The use of any deterministic value (user id, time) as a seed for generating random value,</p><p>3. The use of hashing functions for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">generating pseudorandom number</a></p><p>4. The use of unequal distributed random values.</p><p>Real random function is extremely important for an online casino. It is unfair in relation to users when a weak random function is selected because in spite of the correct nature of probability, the output is still biased.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553769207/tpw5wwcwomnhxactitoh.png"" src=""""/></p><p>        Real Random Function               Weak Random Function</p><p>To solve this problem, we aim at generating a random value, and use a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cryptographically secure generator of pseudorandom numbers</a>. In this case it is difficult for attackers to guess or evaluate the future value. Thus, it provides our platform and our token owners with the best safety.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Challenge 6: Games are not proved to be fair</u></strong></p><p>Most of active casinos are proved to be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provably_fair"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">unfair</a>. It means that the site can cheat any user by selecting a lottery winner they favor. All winners are selected on a random basis.</p><p>As for our games, all of them are completely transparent and fair. All of them are smart contracts that are executed by the EOS.IO blockchain. They are maintained by all producers. As soon as it is released, no part of it can be changed or modified. Its fair nature can be proved by the way it works. Every play is calculated by using three parameters – the client seed, the server seed, and nonce.</p><p>The user can see the client seed and nonce used for the next roll, as well as a hash of the server seed. At the user’s request, it is possible to change the client seed. The server seed is kept in secret before dice rolling. After rolling, the user will get a receipt about the use of the server seed. Then it is possible to check out whether this was the same server seed we mentioned before the roll by checking if the hash of this seed matches the hash shown before the roll.</p><p> </p><p><strong>3 GoldenChip Platform</strong></p><p>The market comprises many gambling platforms. Ours is special because</p><ul>
<li>We support multi-currency,</li>
<li>We share our profit, and</li>
<li>We develop a lot of various games.</li>
</ul><p>More than that, we provide the most sustainable servers by means of covering CDN that is protected by the cloud firewall. Smart AI is used to momentary detect suspicions actions. The cross-platform allows our users to play our games at any time and in any place they want.</p><p> </p><p><strong>3.1 Variety of Games </strong></p><p>We are planning to develop all types of games. We will not stop at dice betting game only. We are going to release about 1-3 games per month. We want to offer a full win-win solution among all holders of tokens. We will develop all kinds of games on the platform and make them long-lasting. This will allow us to protect our tokens and achieve our main goal – to create the first gambling platform that immediately shares profit in the world.</p><p> </p><p><strong>3.2 Multi-Currency</strong></p><p>On the EOS.IO blockchain there are a lot of various coins. In addition to the main EOS, we will support all coins on the platform. Thus, users will be free to choose any coin for betting. Moreover, our team supports betting by using GCHIP tokens. It means that users can use tokens both for sharing the profit, and playing our games.</p><p> </p><p><strong>3.3 Dynamic Max Bet</strong></p><p>Max bet is set to prevent from running out of our bankroll. At the same time when a higher max bet is allowed, it can benefit large players and let them play by using many various strategies. Numbers and probability are calculated accurately, it is still possible for players to consecutively win. In order to prevent bankruptcy, there are platforms that set a fixed max bet in ratio to their bankroll. For example, 1,000 is set as a cap for every bet if the bankroll comprises 100K. Thus, there is a room for some lucky players. However, it is difficult to increase the max bet because much bankroll is required to do this. We have invented another method:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553771351/cw7ku2x9unijwsi3pl6y.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/>Using our formula, various kinds of players can be satisfied by dynamic max bet. It is possible for them to bet large amounts with low expected value, as well as small amounts with high expected value. Typically, the max bet is increased ~100x with the same bankroll by using this mechanism. Our team does not need manual setting of the max bet. Our system automatically protects us from the bankruptcy.</p><p> </p><p><strong>3.4 Private EOS Endpoints</strong></p><p>Outside there are many sites, but they are not sustainable because it is possible for an EOS node to run on a single <a href=""https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/4046"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">core</a>, and no multithreading implementation is possible. It is difficult to grow if the team does not have enough expertise. That is why it is necessary to create and maintain private load balanced sites.</p><p>To do this, it is necessary to apply a load balancer and establish a lot of single core servers to run only one EOS node per one server. Since there is too short block time for EOS, it is impossible to synchronize all nodes. Some of them can be outdated and cause the head block number to jump up and down. We know how to solve this problem. It is necessary to implement our own custom load balancer. However, this requires special knowledge and expertise.</p><p>The GoldenChip team is lucky to have several years’ experience of operating data centers and managing servers. That is why this is not a big problem for us. To provide our users with a sustainable and top-quality service, we have brought to life our own private site with the ability of AI load balancing. We select the best backup node and automatically filter bad and outdated nodes. Thus, we provide modern and scalable sites, and efficiently make a single core EOS official node that runs on various nodes.</p><p>Of course, it takes extra cost to maintain our own private site. However, in spite of this we are sure that it is worth it because it allows us to provide our users with the best gaming environment.</p><p> </p><p><strong>3.5 Leaderboard</strong></p><p><i>“Wishing to win” against “wishing to avoid loss” is a crucial distinction. According to Murayama and Elliot (2012), the competition effects depend on this distinction in the players’ minds. When someone wants to be better than others, they try to benefit from the competition. But when they wish to avoid acting worse than others, competing tends to decrease their performance.</i></p><p>The quote is based on: <a href=""https://medium.com/practical-motivation-science/how-to-motivate-with-leaderboards-da5a461fb2f6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://medium.com/practical-motivation-science/how-to-motivate-with-leaderboards-da5a461fb2f6</a></p><p>The leaderboard is designed on the basis of self-determination theory. According to this theory, people take part in various activities to meet their fundamental psychological needs. The leaderboardcan satisfy one’s conceit. Users set accurate goals when they play in our platform. They want to get the first ranking in the board. Besides, users learn about their progress when they check the leaderboard. This is also one of the ways to interact with other players. We are sure that competition has a motivating nature and stimulates users to achieve even more. We will offer an online leaderboard next to the game. It will show top users.</p><p> </p><p><strong>3.6 Lotteries</strong></p><p>Lottery is one more way to keep users playing on our platform. It does not matter when a user places a bet in any game, 10% of this fee is placed in the lottery pot. It will ensure our pot from lacking tokens.</p><p>1 lottery ticket is provided to users for 1 token they bet. It is also possible to buy 1,000 tickets with 1 token. 80% of the income obtained from selling tickets will be placed in the lottery pot. The rest of the funds will be the profit.</p><p>Every ticket will be numbered in sequence. Ten numbers of lottery tickets will be taken out each hour, and their holders will share the lottery pot as the distribution below.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553772378/itx1bji9nrflb2bcwbjs.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/>Our platform supports multi-token. That is why every token will run its own lottery. Thus, all users have an opportunity to win a large prize when betting in any of our games, and it does not matter whether they win or lose.</p><p>It motivates users to go on using our platform and contributes to retaining users.</p><p> </p><p><strong>3.7 Lucky Payment</strong></p><p>All users can roll a number to win free EOS on a daily basis without any additional expenses and any risk.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553772450/mvf6grq0bdx4u2tvunbr.png"" src=""""/></p><p>We are sure that this strategy is good because it increases the user involvement and attracts a lot of users. We have to pay tokens for prizes, but in spite of this we realize this is relatively cheap as compared to other types of marketing campaigns.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553772806/gunidjgaaiuvxu7l20rk.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Besides, providing users with free tokens is better than spending them on advertising and promotional campaigns. On the one hand, it can increase the brand and user loyalty, and on the other hand, it retains our user base. The higher the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">customer lifetime value</a> is, the more profit we can obtain at the end.</p><p>The rewards based on the statistics collected over time will be reviewed and adjusted to make sure that the rewards are attractive for users and profitable for us.</p><p> </p><p><strong>3.8 Achievements</strong></p><p>Achievements are a perfect way to rise the users’ involvement on our platform. We offer users several missions to complete. Achievements are unlocked afterwards. These missions encourage and motivate our users to pass on various features they might not make a try of on their own initiative. Achievements can also be a wonderful approach to design missions to get greater user retention rate. Users will wish to go on playing on our platform even more.</p><p> </p><p><strong>3.9 GCHIP tokens</strong></p><p>We are motivated by the users who continue playing on our platform and it makes them happy. We enjoy immediately sharing our profit with them. At the same time immediate payout is a great challenge because it comprises a high degree of server workload, a swift change of the balance, and a high cost of network fees. We have made an accurate investigation and learnt how to make immediate payout. Now our users can get their own profit quickly and without any worries. What have we done? We have invented an entirely new token – <strong>GCHIP</strong>.</p><p> </p><p align=""center""><strong><i><u>Max Supply: 18.022.400.000</u></i></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><u>What does the name mean?</u></strong></p><p>The GCHIP name is not originated from “Gambling”. On the contrary, it symbolizes “Fate” and “Gold”. All our existence looks like a GCHIP game. Every new step is made of luck and randomness, while the future itself is the result of this arbitrariness. Moreover, like life itself, GCHIP is exciting and unexpected because you can both win and lose.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Why large max supply?</u></strong></p><p>We made a decision to use a large max supply for marketing because most of users prefer big numbers. Tosucceed, it is necessary to focus on marketing rather than on anything else. This is an important point, although manytoken issuers do not pay due attention to it. No negative effect is here because profit is shared on theproportional basis.

In order to create this value, our company is going to launch an entirely new gambling platform. All owners of tokens will be able to share the platform profits.

They include network, server, marketing and other fees. We will issue 1 token as the startup cost for each 10 tokens that are issued from the overall supply. This will confirm that at the same time large amounts of tokens are not issued. It will allow protect rights of all token holders. More than that, these tokens will not be staked for sharing profit.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Prize Fund (50%)</u></strong></p><p>The fund of prize is the most crucial in our business.It is motivating for our users and makes them bet. It is known that themore tokens are bet by our users, the more profit is made, and the more dividends are received by our token owners. It is the same as in the case of mining bitcoins.To earn more, it is necessary to invest more.This strategy is based on the<i> betting is mining</i> principle. It is the solution that never loses. 204.8 tokens will be issued for each 1 EOS bet, and the final reward is divided into two after every 5% tokens are issued in this manner.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Tokens Sale (20%)</u></strong></p><p>We need to have a considerable budget for operating the site. It is necessary to secure the servers to offer our users the safest and most reliable environment. It is necessary to make a private EOS site to eliminate the unstable nature of a public site. Moreover, this is a great challenge to manage wallets and make immediate payouts.</p><p>The token sale will be launched for 15 days. All tokens that remain are going to be transformed into the fund for motivating the team. After the token sale, we will start sharing the profit. This is when owners of tokens can claim their dividends. Moreover, we have managed to contract exchange platforms. As a result, our coin will be listed after the token sale. 10,000 GCHIP will be issued to the buyer for every EOS. Thus, in total about 360,448 EOS will be funded.</p><p>We will use the raised funds for:</p><p>1. Developing more gaming products,</p><p>2. Fees for law consultations,</p><p>3. Maintaining the platform cost,</p><p>4. Larger bankroll to invite more serious players,</p><p>5. Paying network fees, predominantly staking NET and CPU, and buying RAM,</p><p>6. Marketing costs, and</p><p>7. Maintaining cost of the private efficient sites.</p><p>According to our latest calculations and evaluations, it is necessary to stake at least 30K+ EOS. This amount will let us provide our users with the best user experience.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Motivating the Team (10%)</u></strong></p><p>We are going to continue developing new games. We plan to release from 1 to 3 games each month. To do this, we need to encourage our team. It also includes compensation. Thus, we are going to provide them with token after 50% of all tokens have been issued. 2 tokens are issued from every 10 tokens of the total supply to make sure that no larger number of tokens is issued simultaneously. It will allow to protect rights of everyone. Besides, in the first half of the year they will not be staked for sharing profit.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Bounty Program (10%)</u></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Bug Reports</u></strong></p><p>We believe that for our business the contract we offer is perfect. We will not let any bugs. Every user who reports about bugs is sure to be rewarded 1,000 GCHIP. As for serious bug reports that, for example, cause the loss of platform, the reward will be 100,000 GCHIP for each reporter.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Referral Program</u></strong></p><p>It is extremely important to launch and implement a referral program. In fact, it does not require many funds to get new users. A small motivation fee is a perfect incentive for users to invite their friends to the platform. Sharing positive feedbacks about the platform is a wonderful marketing tool that will allow attracting more and more new loyal users. We are sure it will enable us to expend the platform and increase profits. We will inform about the details later.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Rewards for Signup</u></strong></p><p>During some period of time users will be given 1,000 GCHIP upon signup. We think that a reward for signupis crucial to attract new users.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Events</u></strong></p><p>We are planning to organize various events to efficiently boost the revenues. It will also allow us saving on marketing. This is because our users will act as promoters sharing information about our platform with their friends and acquaintances. Our experience shows that events are effective for attracting public attention. Positive gaming experience and funs on the platform will allow growing our user base.</p><p> </p><p><strong>3.10 Revenues Use and Profit Sharing</strong></p><p>We are going to become a stable platform that will continue operating for a long period of time. We do not aim at instant profits and escaping. We want to expand our business. That is why we need a good and efficient strategy. It is not easy to adjust the use. To compete, we need power and the ability to make our users happy. We have made much research and investigations, and came to the conclusion that the following revenue distribution scheme will be the most efficient one:</p><p><strong><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553773151/r1450u1gob8ggl1ofhfq.png"" src=""""/></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Bankroll (40%)</u></strong></p><p>Bankroll must include the downward side of the variation expected for a certain stake.

In fact, according to mathematics, this strategy is a high risk. It is not that difficult to lose 10 rounds in a row. The table below demonstrates the statistic when 50% is chosen as the expected value and starting with $1:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553774300/fu03uyoquuwexj83y8dp.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The actual payout is similar to the expected one, but the user needs much money to bet for a dollar.

If there is no enough bankroll, it is necessary to limit the amount for betting to avoid the use of this strategy. The bankroll supports the betting limit. A larger bankroll means our ability to support a higher betting limit. In its turn, it enables users to bet at a higher amount. Having a high limit, users can use more betting strategies. It makes them feel comfortable and they do not stop playing even using large amounts. It increases the odds of losing more eventually.</p><p>But what will happen if we add the tax?</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553774391/zyky1i0pkdgxoyqbdg1h.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The user loses money after round 5 when the tax is used because of the wrong calculation.

According to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pareto principle</a>, 80% of the profit is generated by 20% of the players.

Thus, we take more expenses for the bankroll purposes.</p><p>As the time goes on, the bankroll ratio is adjusted in order to make sure that the platform has enough bankroll for supporting games and is attractive for serious players. Since there are difficulties in sharing the bankroll across all games and there is a risk of attacks, the bankroll must be separated into different contracts and accounts. That is why we are in need of more bankroll to support more games. The bankroll ratio will be adjusted on the quarterly basis by using the following formula:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553774592/e6lbcgkzr6uypy7wut0i.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Besides, when the project is over, all bankroll will be spent for dividends.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Operating Cost (10%)</u></strong></p><p>In order to make our competitiveness better, our team has to go on developing new games.

GoldenChip is a gaming platform that shares its profit and is based on the EOS.IO blockchain. The blockchain ecosystem has enabled us to form a new gambling platform that provides a safe, trustworthy and unlimited gambling system. All games found on the platform are extremely fair because they are maintained by the blockchain. The GCHIP tokens provide their holders with the dividends obtained from the game profits on the platform. At the same time due to the cross-platform, users can play at any time and from any device.The team of GoldenChip has a large experience of working as a developer of mobile games on Web, IOS, and Android on the blockchain there are many DApps, but we are sure that our expertise in developing games, operatingand marketing them will enable us to become market leaders. 1. ​IntroductionOur team started its professional activity in developing games in 2010. In 2012 the whole industry started being involved into the mobile world. Therefore, we started developing mobile games, too. We performed all actions – including design, development, operation and marketing – on our own without attracting any third parties. It allowed us to obtain perfect gaming experience. We have learnt how to attract users and publicity, how to maintain users, and how to prolong the game popularity. It took us only several years to achieve more than 10 million downloads and gain above 1 million users who actively played our games.Our deep involvement in the cryptocurrency industry has started since 2015. Certainly, it set some challenges, but at the same time it allowed us looking at our activity in a new and unprejudiced way. We started developing unique games that made us different from our competitors. Moreover, it allowed us to become absolute market leaders. Step by step we launched our own mining pool and thus made our own contribution to the network. We fixed daemon bugs and provided feedback. The industry was growing, so were we. We learnt how to add something exciting and entirely new to the network. We based our gaming philosophy on three presumptions: firstly, people love games, secondly, they prefer simple games and avoid complexity, and thirdly, they do not like high cost and high risks. Thanks to the EOS.IO blockchain, we have a perfect platform where we can easily achieve our goals. As soon as the blockchainwas launched, our team began to plan and find the best method to develop on it. The code of implementing the node was read, our own endpoints were built, and as a result a sustainable and safe network on the cloud was provided. Each step was taken as carefully as possible until the whole blockchain was perfectly understood. At last, our first project – GoldenChip – was launched.The EOS.IO blockchain is the basis of GoldenChip. It offers a reliable, profitable and top-quality gambling expertise on the Internet. It involves the principles of not only traditional online gambling platforms, but also online cryptocurrency casinos. At the same time it has not the disadvantages of those above, including high commission fees, slow depositing and withdrawing, and lack of reliability. Our company has the aim to become the largest cryptocurrency gambling platform. We know that we can achieve this goal only by sharing our own profits with holders of our tokens. Thus, we invite every user to join us and help us to increase our community. We are sure that in addition to our own team and our offer, these are users who create the value. Joining us, you contribute to working out a perfect solution on developing and marketing that is sure to benefit each owner of our tokens. 2. Market Analysis2.1 General DataThe following activities are thought to be online gambling:
casino games,
bingo,
lotteries,
sports betting
poker.
The largest share of the market is made by sports betting and casino games. The latter include such activities as slot machines, dice and roulette. According to some forecasts, by 2022 online gambling will have achieved USD 59.79 billion. Fig. 1. Global Market of Gambling from 2009 to 2015, Including Forecasts for 2016-2020https://www.statista.com/statistics/270728/market-volume-of-online-gaming-worldwide/ 2.2 ChallengesTraditional Casinos FaceThis is not a secret that traditional casinos face a lot of difficulties and shortcomingsthat complicate the attraction of new users. We are sure that the operation performed on the EOS.IO blockchain will make it possible to avoidthe above problems. Challenge 1. Tokens are insignificantIn some traditional casinos tokens are issued for their users, but the majority of them are insignificant because they are not circulated and there are no loyal users. Sometimes issuers pump and dump their tokens to increase the price by making recommendations that are based on incorrect, false or greatly dramatized statements. Besides, some issuers even betray the users’ confidence as soon as they issue the ICO.In order to issue the most trustable tokens, our team made the decision to launch the platform. It showed our hard work at developing and marketing for the game success. Our tokens are actively circulating on the exchange and market, and we entirely control them. Moreover, each token owner can fully control them by auditing how coins are spent. We share our profits, and thus we make up a foundation value for all coins. It means that the value will never become zero. When tokens are issued by the users who play the game, it means that we have sufficient profit and it will never be zero. Only a little part of the tokens is reserved for ourselves. It means that it never stops developing because we personally have a great interest in the token success and value. We conducted a small and short-term token sale. Our task was to prove that we do not scam or deceive our users. All we want is to start the project that has enough budget to let us achieve our success. Challenge 2: Slow withdrawals and depositsThe players attending ordinary casinos have to change chips or credit a definite amount of money. However, they often wait for a long period time to get a cashback. The progress itself is too slow. In fact, it is far from reliable and the results are not too good. These are the most common issues:
It is easy to deposit money but it is difficult to withdraw it.
The balance is displayed incorrectly.
Depositing and withdrawing are slow. It may take users up to several hours to complete the action.
Audit is not provided.
New users are not trusted.
High withdrawal fees are demanded.
To solve these problems, any EOS-based tokens are accepted for our games. EOS enables users toapply their coins without making any deposits and/or withdrawals. Instant payments and payoutsonly provefull confidence and safety. It also diminishes the risk of bugs. The blockchain records all transactions. It means that all records can be easily audited by any user at any time. Challenge 3: Attacks of botsAttacks of bots are the most ordinary attack an online casino may suffer. Especially in relation to smart contracts, users can push actions directly to the blockchain without using the gaming platform. Besides, creating bots, it is possible to get benefits from every event organized by us. Of course, it is not fair in relation to any other players, when the majority of the rewards are taken by attacker. This is not our aim.To solve this problem and in general to eliminate this situation, our team will implement a special mechanism on checking sums to make sure that all players are pushing actions on our platform. It is hard for attackers to forge the request because the checksum mechanism is calculated in private. It requires a lot of work to understand and get the answer. This is how we can decrease the number of bots and protect the rights of all our users. Challenge 4: Almost unsecureTraditional online casinos tend to collect personal information. Users are required to providetheir passport number, details of bank accounts, real name, etc. for verification and payouts. In spite of the fact that all these details are sensitive, they are stored in unsafe servers that can be easily accessed by hackers. As a result, some valuable information can leak.These and other associated problems can be eliminated by using the EOS Scatter wallet. Users can access our platform by signing up and logging in through Scatter. The only data you need to use is your own device. It is up to the user whether to provide or hide his or her private information. Challenge 5: The random function is unsafeIn case the random function is unwell designed, it can be vulnerable, and hackers can easily break it. Random is thought to be the most difficult part on modern computers. This is not a secret that some developers do not have enough expertise to form true random values.These are some frequent mistakes made by developers:1. The use of easily estimated seed for random,2. The use of any deterministic value (user id, time) as a seed for generating random value,3. The use of hashing functions for generating pseudorandom number4. The use of unequal distributed random values.Real random function is extremely important for an online casino. It is unfair in relation to users when a weak random function is selected because in spite of the correct nature of probability, the output is still biased.        Real Random Function               Weak Random FunctionTo solve this problem, we aim at generating a random value, and use a cryptographically secure generator of pseudorandom numbers. In this case it is difficult for attackers to guess or evaluate the future value. Thus, it provides our platform and our token owners with the best safety. Challenge 6: Games are not proved to be fairMost of active casinos are proved to be unfair. It means that the site can cheat any user by selecting a lottery winner they favor. All winners are selected on a random basis.As for our games, all of them are completely transparent and fair. All of them are smart contracts that are executed by the EOS.IO blockchain. They are maintained by all producers. As soon as it is released, no part of it can be changed or modified. Its fair nature can be proved by the way it works. Every play is calculated by using three parameters – the client seed, the server seed, and nonce.The user can see the client seed and nonce used for the next roll, as well as a hash of the server seed. At the user’s request, it is possible to change the client seed. The server seed is kept in secret before dice rolling. After rolling, the user will get a receipt about the use of the server seed. Then it is possible to check out whether this was the same server seed we mentioned before the roll by checking if the hash of this seed matches the hash shown before the roll. 3 GoldenChip PlatformThe market comprises many gambling platforms. Ours is special because
We support multi-currency,
We share our profit, and
We develop a lot of various games.
More than that, we provide the most sustainable servers by means of covering CDN that is protected by the cloud firewall. Smart AI is used to momentary detect suspicions actions. The cross-platform allows our users to play our games at any time and in any place they want. 3.1 Variety of Games We are planning to develop all types of games. We will not stop at dice betting game only. We are going to release about 1-3 games per month. We want to offer a full win-win solution among all holders of tokens. We will develop all kinds of games on the platform and make them long-lasting. This will allow us to protect our tokens and achieve our main goal – to create the first gambling platform that immediately shares profit in the world. 3.2 Multi-CurrencyOn the EOS.IO blockchain there are a lot of various coins. In addition to the main EOS, we will support all coins on the platform. Thus, users will be free to choose any coin for betting. Moreover, our team supports betting by using GCHIP tokens. It means that users can use tokens both for sharing the profit, and playing our games. 3.3 Dynamic Max BetMax bet is set to prevent from running out of our bankroll. At the same time when a higher max bet is allowed, it can benefit large players and let them play by using many various strategies. Numbers and probability are calculated accurately, it is still possible for players to consecutively win. In order to prevent bankruptcy, there are platforms that set a fixed max bet in ratio to their bankroll. For example, 1,000 is set as a cap for every bet if the bankroll comprises 100K. Thus, there is a room for some lucky players. However, it is difficult to increase the max bet because much bankroll is required to do this. We have invented another method:Using our formula, various kinds of players can be satisfied by dynamic max bet. It is possible for them to bet large amounts with low expected value, as well as small amounts with high expected value. Typically, the max bet is increased ~100x with the same bankroll by using this mechanism. Our team does not need manual setting of the max bet. Our system automatically protects us from the bankruptcy. 3.4 Private EOS EndpointsOutside there are many sites, but they are not sustainable because it is possible for an EOS node to run on a single core, and no multithreading implementation is possible. It is difficult to grow if the team does not have enough expertise. That is why it is necessary to create and maintain private load balanced sites.To do this, it is necessary to apply a load balancer and establish a lot of single core servers to run only one EOS node per one server. Since there is too short block time for EOS, it is impossible to synchronize all nodes. Some of them can be outdated and cause the head block number to jump up and down. We know how to solve this problem. It is necessary to implement our own custom load balancer. However, this requires special knowledge and expertise.The GoldenChip team is lucky to have several years’ experience of operating data centers and managing servers. That is why this is not a big problem for us. To provide our users with a sustainable and top-quality service, we have brought to life our own private site with the ability of AI load balancing. We select the best backup node and automatically filter bad and outdated nodes. Thus, we provide modern and scalable sites, and efficiently make a single core EOS official node that runs on various nodes.Of course, it takes extra cost to maintain our own private site. However, in spite of this we are sure that it is worth it because it allows us to provide our users with the best gaming environment. 3.5 Leaderboard“Wishing to win” against “wishing to avoid loss” is a crucial distinction. According to Murayama and Elliot (2012), the competition effects depend on this distinction in the players’ minds. When someone wants to be better than others, they try to benefit from the competition. But when they wish to avoid acting worse than others, competing tends to decrease their performance.The quote is based on: https://medium.com/practical-motivation-science/how-to-motivate-with-leaderboards-da5a461fb2f6The leaderboard is designed on the basis of self-determination theory. According to this theory, people take part in various activities to meet their fundamental psychological needs. The leaderboardcan satisfy one’s conceit. Users set accurate goals when they play in our platform. They want to get the first ranking in the board. Besides, users learn about their progress when they check the leaderboard. This is also one of the ways to interact with other players. We are sure that competition has a motivating nature and stimulates users to achieve even more. We will offer an online leaderboard next to the game. It will show top users. 3.6 LotteriesLottery is one more way to keep users playing on our platform. It does not matter when a user places a bet in any game, 10% of this fee is placed in the lottery pot. It will ensure our pot from lacking tokens.1 lottery ticket is provided to users for 1 token they bet. It is also possible to buy 1,000 tickets with 1 token. 80% of the income obtained from selling tickets will be placed in the lottery pot. The rest of the funds will be the profit.Every ticket will be numbered in sequence. Ten numbers of lottery tickets will be taken out each hour, and their holders will share the lottery pot as the distribution below.Our platform supports multi-token. That is why every token will run its own lottery. Thus, all users have an opportunity to win a large prize when betting in any of our games, and it does not matter whether they win or lose.It motivates users to go on using our platform and contributes to retaining users. 3.7 Lucky PaymentAll users can roll a number to win free EOS on a daily basis without any additional expenses and any risk.We are sure that this strategy is good because it increases the user involvement and attracts a lot of users. We have to pay tokens for prizes, but in spite of this we realize this is relatively cheap as compared to other types of marketing campaigns.Besides, providing users with free tokens is better than spending them on advertising and promotional campaigns. On the one hand, it can increase the brand and user loyalty, and on the other hand, it retains our user base. The higher the customer lifetime value is, the more profit we can obtain at the end.The rewards based on the statistics collected over time will be reviewed and adjusted to make sure that the rewards are attractive for users and profitable for us. 3.8 AchievementsAchievements are a perfect way to rise the users’ involvement on our platform. We offer users several missions to complete. Achievements are unlocked afterwards. These missions encourage and motivate our users to pass on various features they might not make a try of on their own initiative. Achievements can also be a wonderful approach to design missions to get greater user retention rate. Users will wish to go on playing on our platform even more. 3.9 GCHIP tokensWe are motivated by the users who continue playing on our platform and it makes them happy. We enjoy immediately sharing our profit with them. At the same time immediate payout is a great challenge because it comprises a high degree of server workload, a swift change of the balance, and a high cost of network fees. We have made an accurate investigation and learnt how to make immediate payout. Now our users can get their own profit quickly and without any worries. What have we done? We have invented an entirely new token – GCHIP. Max Supply: 18.022.400.000 What does the name mean?The GCHIP name is not originated from “Gambling”. On the contrary, it symbolizes “Fate” and “Gold”. All our existence looks like a GCHIP game. Every new step is made of luck and randomness, while the future itself is the result of this arbitrariness. Moreover, like life itself, GCHIP is exciting and unexpected because you can both win and lose. Why large max supply?We made a decision to use a large max supply for marketing because most of users prefer big numbers. Tosucceed, it is necessary to focus on marketing rather than on anything else. This is an important point, although manytoken issuers do not pay due attention to it. No negative effect is here because profit is shared on theproportional basis. It also simplifies immediate payouts. How to create GCHIP value?There is no sense to issue tokens that have no value. In order to create this value, our company is going to launch an entirely new gambling platform. All owners of tokens will be able to share the platform profits. Our goal is to develop an entirely winning solution. We believe that GCHIP will become one of the most valuable tokens on theexchange. Detailed Distribution Cost of Startup (10%)High costs are required for operating a gambling site. They include network, server, marketing and other fees. We will issue 1 token as the startup cost for each 10 tokens that are issued from the overall supply. This will confirm that at the same time large amounts of tokens are not issued. It will allow protect rights of all token holders. More than that, these tokens will not be staked for sharing profit. Prize Fund (50%)The fund of prize is the most crucial in our business.It is motivating for our users and makes them bet. It is known that themore tokens are bet by our users, the more profit is made, and the more dividends are received by our token owners. It is the same as in the case of mining bitcoins.To earn more, it is necessary to invest more.This strategy is based on the betting is mining principle. It is the solution that never loses. 204.8 tokens will be issued for each 1 EOS bet, and the final reward is divided into two after every 5% tokens are issued in this manner. Tokens Sale (20%)We need to have a considerable budget for operating the site. It is necessary to secure the servers to offer our users the safest and most reliable environment. It is necessary to make a private EOS site to eliminate the unstable nature of a public site. Moreover, this is a great challenge to manage wallets and make immediate payouts.The token sale will be launched for 15 days. All tokens that remain are going to be transformed into the fund for motivating the team. After the token sale, we will start sharing the profit. This is when owners of tokens can claim their dividends. Moreover, we have managed to contract exchange platforms. As a result, our coin will be listed after the token sale. 10,000 GCHIP will be issued to the buyer for every EOS. Thus, in total about 360,448 EOS will be funded.We will use the raised funds for:1. Developing more gaming products,2. Fees for law consultations,3. Maintaining the platform cost,4. Larger bankroll to invite more serious players,5. Paying network fees, predominantly staking NET and CPU, and buying RAM,6. Marketing costs, and7. Maintaining cost of the private efficient sites.According to our latest calculations and evaluations, it is necessary to stake at least 30K+ EOS. This amount will let us provide our users with the best user experience. Motivating the Team (10%)We are going to continue developing new games. We plan to release from 1 to 3 games each month. To do this, we need to encourage our team. It also includes compensation. Thus, we are going to provide them with token after 50% of all tokens have been issued. 2 tokens are issued from every 10 tokens of the total supply to make sure that no larger number of tokens is issued simultaneously. It will allow to protect rights of everyone. Besides, in the first half of the year they will not be staked for sharing profit. Bounty Program (10%) Bug ReportsWe believe that for our business the contract we offer is perfect. We will not let any bugs. Every user who reports about bugs is sure to be rewarded 1,000 GCHIP. As for serious bug reports that, for example, cause the loss of platform, the reward will be 100,000 GCHIP for each reporter. Referral ProgramIt is extremely important to launch and implement a referral program. In fact, it does not require many funds to get new users. A small motivation fee is a perfect incentive for users to invite their friends to the platform. Sharing positive feedbacks about the platform is a wonderful marketing tool that will allow attracting more and more new loyal users. We are sure it will enable us to expend the platform and increase profits. We will inform about the details later. Rewards for SignupDuring some period of time users will be given 1,000 GCHIP upon signup. We think that a reward for signupis crucial to attract new users. EventsWe are planning to organize various events to efficiently boost the revenues. It will also allow us saving on marketing. This is because our users will act as promoters sharing information about our platform with their friends and acquaintances. Our experience shows that events are effective for attracting public attention. Positive gaming experience and funs on the platform will allow growing our user base. 3.10 Revenues Use and Profit SharingWe are going to become a stable platform that will continue operating for a long period of time. We do not aim at instant profits and escaping. We want to expand our business. That is why we need a good and efficient strategy. It is not easy to adjust the use. To compete, we need power and the ability to make our users happy. We have made much research and investigations, and came to the conclusion that the following revenue distribution scheme will be the most efficient one: Bankroll (40%)Bankroll must include the downward side of the variation expected for a certain stake. The platform cannot withhold a certain amount as the funds.A famous strategy based on double up betting is used by many players because they are persuaded that it is always winning. In fact, according to mathematics, this strategy is a high risk. It is not that difficult to lose 10 rounds in a row. The table below demonstrates the statistic when 50% is chosen as the expected value and starting with $1: The actual payout is similar to the expected one, but the user needs much money to bet for a dollar. If you have the bankrollover, you will become a bankrupt. In case of a cap in the game, this strategy is very difficult to play.It is the same about the casino. If there is no enough bankroll, it is necessary to limit the amount for betting to avoid the use of this strategy. The bankroll supports the betting limit. A larger bankroll means our ability to support a higher betting limit. In its turn, it enables users to bet at a higher amount. Having a high limit, users can use more betting strategies. It makes them feel comfortable and they do not stop playing even using large amounts. It increases the odds of losing more eventually.But what will happen if we add the tax? The user loses money after round 5 when the tax is used because of the wrong calculation. We must not double the wager, it is also necessary to consider the tax in the calculation to eliminate this flaw. There are still a lot of players who fail to understand this flaw and go on playing.There are also a lot of players who bet non-stop. They are mainly small players. According to the Pareto principle, 80% of the profit is generated by 20% of the players. If the limit for betting is too low, there is the risk to lose that part of income.A larger bankroll also means our ability to launch more games. In its turn, it will attract more players and thus generate more revenues and make the competitiveness better.We need to increase the bankroll as quickly as possible. This will allow us to compete with others. A higher bankroll is crucial for getting a competitive benefit. Besides, they are better in the long run. Thus, we take more expenses for the bankroll purposes.As the time goes on, the bankroll ratio is adjusted in order to make sure that the platform has enough bankroll for supporting games and is attractive for serious players. Since there are difficulties in sharing the bankroll across all games and there is a risk of attacks, the bankroll must be separated into different contracts and accounts. That is why we are in need of more bankroll to support more games. The bankroll ratio will be adjusted on the quarterly basis by using the following formula:Besides, when the project is over, all bankroll will be spent for dividends. Operating Cost (10%)In order to make our competitiveness better, our team has to go on developing new games. The more games arelaunched, the more revenues can be generated. It is necessary to employ more and more talented and highly professionaldevelopers. This will allow us expanding globally.We aim at providing the most stable, best and safest gaming platform. To do this, we need to maintainour own servers and network. This may require funds, but we want to minimize the costs. Using ourlarge experience, we want to make sure that our setup can support the traffic and offer the best service withlow cost.It is not a secret that in order to become famous and popular, it is necessary to promote the platform. We are not going to spend large sums for advertising campaigns. Instead we want to use a small budget for attracting people’s attention by organizing various types of events. We are thought to be a decentralized gaming platform. Some methods of our work include contests, bonus tokens for newcomers, and media coordination. Net Profit (50%)We believe that all holders of our tokens can share their success. We are thankful to them for their contributions. We want them to be happy, highly motivated and interested. We also want to share our wealth with them. That is why we are going to share the largest part of our profit as the prize. Immediate payoutwill be adopted. To learn more, please read Section 3.12 Immediate payout.We want to offer a gaming platform where everyone will win. It will be based on friendly entertainment and profit sharing principles. 3.11 Immediate PayoutWe want users of our platform to accumulate and get the profit we share without any additional actions. It may seem to be difficult technically. If we want to share our profit immediately, we must know the number of the tokens that are circulating at the moment when the profit is shared. This will allow us to distribute the profit fairly. We can achieve it by taking snapshot of the EOS blockchain. Although in case of immediate profit sharing, we will need a lot of snapshots which may cause our servers over-load. Besides, it will take time to send tokens directly to holders of tokens.In order to solve this problem, we have developed a new payout system. Now users do not need to oftenstate about theirpayout. However,it does not mean that they will miss any. All holders of the tokens who wish to share the profit should stake their GCHIP token. After that our system will accumulate the profit everyhour. They can state the accumulated rewards at any time they wish. We are going to share all profitsfrom the platform, including EOS and all tokens we support and managed to earn. Profit = Current bankroll− Last bankroll Foraccurately and quicklycalculating the profit, each hour will be taken as a calculationpoint. If it is positive, it will be taken as revenue. After that it will be processed for the distribution. If it is negative, it will be accumulated to the next round until becoming positiveagain. It will be processed.The interval can be shortened later. If the interval is a minuteor even a second, the payout will be made immediately.Whenautomatically implementing the payout, the payout can be made without any additional actions. If usersset the automaticthreshold of the payout, the payout will be automatically sent by the system to their accounts in casetheir balance is above the threshold.If users intend to use GCHIP that is staked, they will have to unstack first. GCHIP will be refunded in 24 hours. In the future it is possible to decrease it, but first it is set as 24 hours.It will allow decreasing the server workload needed to take the EOS blockchain snapshot. Besides, it will let us share the profit in a short period of time. The reduction of the tokens circulation will also increase the tokens price. 4 Roadmap",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Zombie with a Shotgun is going to be that zombie GAME where all the rules we know about zombie GAMES go right out the window.​</p>
<p>It begins:</p>
<p><i>You’re getting chased! Quickly you hurry through the front door of an old apartment complex.<br/>For a second you think you’re safe, but better think again! Accomplices to the ones that are after you are already inside, hiding in the dank hallway for you to show up.<br/>You have a room here, where you have your belongings. You left the apartment-key on the dresser so get to your place , pick up that key and lock the door behind you!<br/>You pull a tucked away handgun and prepare to face your enemies.</i></p>
<p><i>GAME ON!!!</i></p>
<p><i>Shoot down the bad guys, pick up some weapons, pet and rescue some rabbits and be careful around all those zombies roaming 'round the dark. They're hungry!...</i></p>
<p><i>Feel like wasting ammo? Blast away your enemies, cupboards, chairs, vases, and whatever else gets in the way! Though some things may be better left alone as they'll keep you covered from enemy fire - at least a little while.</i></p>

Zombie with a Shotgun is going to be that zombie GAME where all the rules we know about zombie GAMES go right out the window.​
It begins:
You’re getting chased! Quickly you hurry through the front door of an old apartment complex.For a second you think you’re safe, but better think again! Accomplices to the ones that are after you are already inside, hiding in the dank hallway for you to show up.You have a room here, where you have your belongings. You left the apartment-key on the dresser so get to your place , pick up that key and lock the door behind you!You pull a tucked away handgun and prepare to face your enemies.
GAME ON!!!
Shoot down the bad guys, pick up some weapons, pet and rescue some rabbits and be careful around all those zombies roaming 'round the dark. They're hungry!...
Feel like wasting ammo? Blast away your enemies, cupboards, chairs, vases, and whatever else gets in the way! Though some things may be better left alone as they'll keep you covered from enemy fire - at least a little while.

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><br/><strong>Q:</strong> Can I buy more laps after the campaign has ended? <br/><strong>A:</strong>
 Based on our projections we are expecting to sell out of laps offered 
in the funded vehicle. We are expecting to sell available laps in other 
vehicles in our fleet. We will have a capacity number based on required 
days to fulfill our offer during the tour. In the event we do end up 
offering additional laps in the funded vehicle, we will be increasing 
these rates after the campaign has ended.<br/><strong><br/>Q:</strong> What are your age Restrictions? <br/><strong>A:</strong> Driving:18+ with a valid drivers license. Ride-Along: 6+ with a parent or guardian <br/><strong><br/>Q:</strong> My daughter is a car fanatic, she is 10 year old. Question, do you offer ride-along experiences? <br/><strong>A:</strong>
 Quick answer, YES! This is is the part of the business we love THE 
most. She will be in the hands of a professional and she will go 
nuts...You're about to be the parent of the year! <br/></p>
<strong>Q:</strong> Can I bring a passenger in the car?<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 Sorry, on our traveling tour we will be requiring a professional 
instructor to sit shot-gun. All of our Supercars are 2 seat vehicles. 
Come out to Denver and you can join one of our YOU+1 Canyon driving 
tours, in this setting you can bring a passenger.<strong><br/><br/>Q:</strong> Do I pick a car when I get to the event?<br/><strong>A:</strong> No, you need to get on the schedule and join a heat.<br/><strong><br/>Q:</strong> Will you sell out?<br/><strong>A:</strong> We sure hope so, if your a registered backer we will deliver.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><strong><br/>Q:</strong>
 Not being a downer, but if you don't make the goal to get the P1 can I 
pick any of the Supercars to drive if I back your campaign?<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 We know it's a huge undertaking and we are hopeful the car community 
will want to make this happen... However we are grounded and down to 
earth. If it does not happen and we meet one of the other goals, Yes you
 can drive any of our cars using your allocated lap(s)<br/><br/><strong>Q:</strong> I can't drive, can I sit in the Ferrari 458 Italia and take a picture with the 458 ?<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 It's going to be an action packed day when we are in your city. If you 
grab an Oxotic team member we will see if we can make it happen!<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><strong><br/>Q:</strong>
 I like the idea of driving a P1 but I LOVE LAMBOS! Can I just drive 
your Superleggera with my 3 Laps instead of the Funded vehicle?<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 When registering you will pick the city and the vehicle you would like 
to reserve. We have two tiers of laps Funded vehicle and fleet vehicle. 
Funded vehicle laps can be used on any cars in the fleet. Fleet laps can
 not be used on funded vehicle(s). So, Yes... you can have at it with 
the Superleggera! Great choice BTW!<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><br/><strong>Q:</strong> When will the tour dates be release ?<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 As you can imagine there is a lot of planning that will go into 
delivering a world-class event. We need a few months to get our ducks in
 a row. Our guess, late Summer 2015 dates will be released. We will have
 a newsletter that goes out twice a month with updates. If you back us 
you will automatically be on the list.<br/><strong><br/>Q:</strong> I want your job. Let's make that happen. ok?<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 ;), It's pretty RAD, yes. But it's still work. FUN work, but work. Get 
involved when we come to your city, we will need volunteers. Join our 
mailing list and you will be notified when we have volunteer sign ups. 
Our boss will even feed you and give you free stuff!<strong><br/><br/>Q:</strong> Will there be food and drinks at the event?<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 We are putting on a World-Class experience here... not some hack show 
;) We will arrange to have food-trucks in attendance, Drinks will be 
sold at multiple stations throughout the event area. You're welcome to 
bring coolers, food/drinks, shade tents, lawn chairs etc.<strong><br/><br/>Q:</strong> Can I buy additional laps at the event. <br/><strong>A:</strong>
 This is a question we would LOVE to say yes. At this point, we really 
don't know if we will have flexibility to offer additional appointments 
above and beyond those reserved by the initial backers. Our advice is to
 contribute and fund based on the laps you think you need. If we have 
openings and can add additional laps then we will offer to our backers 
prior to the event.<br/><strong><br/>Q:</strong> Do I need to bring a helmet?<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 We will provide Helmets and head socks are available for purchase at 
the event. You're welcome to bring your own Motor Racing helmet 
(restrictions apply)<strong><br/><br/>Q:</strong> Say you get the P1, What happens to it after the tour? <br/><strong>A:</strong>
 Well we put it in our fleet and offer it to the general public. We are 
doing this for the community and want to continue to offer it as we 
offer the rest of our Supercars. You will need to come to Denver to 
visit the P1 after the Tour has been completed<strong>.<br/><br/>Q:</strong> Are your fleet cars modified, do they have governors.<br/><strong>A:</strong> No, they are all bone stock as they came from the factory.<br/><strong><br/>Q:</strong> Can I take my own Pictures or do I have to buy yours?<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 Most packages include a free key to download our professional pictures.
 However, we do allow cameras at the event, snap away cowboy!<br/><strong><br/>Q:</strong> My package does not include a Hat, can I buy one at the event or now?<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 Once we have designs finalized we will open an e-commerce site, where 
you can order merchandise. We will also have a merchandise booth at the 
event. Please send us feedback on items you would like to see.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><strong><br/>Q:</strong> Is this really going to happen?<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 Honestly, We sure do hope so. We've put a ton of time and money to get 
it to this point. We are not going anywhere if the campaign falls short.
 We operate a busy Supercar Experience company in Colorado. We conduct 
on average 100 Driving tours a week. Often our cars are booked 2 months 
in advance. So, It will happen if the community wants to back it. If 
they do we are the team that can deliver. In fact we are super excited 
to take our experience on the road. We know how to throw an event<strong>.<br/><br/>Q:</strong> I've never been on a track. Can I still do this experience.<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 Everyone has to start somewhere. Why not in a Hypercar or Supercar! LOL
 We would prefer that you get a package that has both a Supercar and 
Hypercar lap included. If not we will get you comfortable in the funded 
car. If everything works out as we hope, and you have a lap in the 
funded car and a lap in one of our fleet supercars. We will start with 
the Supercar first.<br/><strong><br/>Q:</strong> I thought all of the P1's were sold?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can not order a P1 but there are a number on the 2nd hand market. This is where we will source ours.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><strong><br/>Q:</strong> Can I bring my GoPro camera?<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 Yes, we will have mounts inside the car, ready for GoPro cameras. We 
will also have GoPro cameras available for rental and SD cards for 
purchase at the event.<br/><br/><strong>Q:</strong> What's the catch? Like will I have the equivalent to a city block to drive the P1?<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 Actually we are going by the lap in most cases. Certain Perks have 
actual  mile route experiences offered (in Denver). At the track, it's 
the track lap. Distance obviously differs from track to track. Seriously
 we are not into funny businesses or fine print. We do these drives year
 round and have almost 4,000  under our belt. We want you to walk away 
saying WOW, that's the best money i've ever spent!<strong><br/><br/>Q:</strong> I'm 6'5 can I fit in these cars?<br/><strong>A:</strong>
 We would say all cars should accommodate, with the exception of the 
Superleggera. It has a fixed carbon fiber seat that has just backwards 
and forward seat adjustments.<strong><br/><br/>Q:</strong> Take my money, take my money!!!!... I MUST to drive a P1. <br/><strong>A:</strong>
 We get it, and we are doing everything we can to make this happen! We 
need to get  the campaign fully funded to get to the P1. We feel bullish
 that it can happen. Tell your friends and support our effort!<br/><strong><br/>Q:</strong> Will there be other things to do at your event? <br/><strong>A:</strong>
 Yes, we are planning to have a car corral area.  Trendy Food trucks, 
Drink vendors, etc. We are trying to bring the local car communities 
together in every city we visit.<br/><strong><br/>Q:</strong> Can I bring a passenger in the car with me? <br/><strong>A:</strong>
 Sorry but they're not gonna fit, We will have a professional driving 
instructor riding shotgun with you. If it's a ride-along we can only 
allow one passenger to ride safely. <br/></div>","Do you have a dream of driving a Supercar or even a Hypercar at Circuit of The Americas, the greatest Formula One track in North America? This is a community project that we can and will deliver... We are an established driving experience

novel. This means like a novel, it would have an engrossing story line that one
can be captivated by. But unlike a regular novel, this will be interactive. The
reader creates their own story! How cool is that? </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435835372/hgv2e4mlmgeziyji1ujv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Let me explain further: At certain points in the story, the
reader will be given a number of options to choose from that will determine how
the story progresses further. Every choice will lead to a different ending. So
essentially, you can’t play it once, because every time you play and make a
different choice, it leads to a different ending.</p><p>Here's an exclusive trailer that I think will explain it better.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F41jKYrFDxaw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D41jKYrFDxaw&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F41jKYrFDxaw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><b>3. Why i think it's important...</b></p>
<p>I feel the need to develop this game because I love an
interesting story. I always have. And I know a lot of women out there do too.
But in addition to that and most importantly, this game will be an educational
tool for young women. Because our stories will be about societal ills we
experience or hear about on a daily basis. The story follows the life of
Cecelia, a teenage girl growing up in unenviable circumstances and trying to
navigate the pitfalls of early marriage, abuse, promiscuity, drugs and a host
of other things. Playing the game as Cecelia gives the reader an immersive
experience that I hope will help them relate with her circumstances and thus
know how some of the choices we make in life will impact our future for good or
otherwise.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p>I feel I’m not doing the description much justice. When we
launch, you all will better understand what I am trying to say. Trust me, it’ll
be awesome!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436125413/knqnllyrlnlvppph7hmu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>4.  </b><b>Why we need a little help...</b></p>
<p>So from the description above, you can tell that as awesome
as this project is, it’s also a massive one. We’ll need to hire a number of
amazing writers to create amazing story lines full of plot twists and cliff hangers.
The success of the whole project hinges on the quality of the story really. So
we need writers who are worth their salt and that isn’t going to come cheap. In
addition, we also need kick-ass graphic artists to bring the story alive with
unbelievable lines and colors. That isn’t going to come cheap either. Then
there are also voice actors, music/sound producers and programmers.</p>
<p>It helps that we have a bunch of young, vibrant, independent
artisans who are totally on-board with this project and will not charge the
full price they would normally do but we all have to feed while we are working
on this and it’s always good to encourage talent.</p>
<p>That is why we need your help and your donations. Without
you all, this project will not have the kind of impact we would like it to. We
believe anything worth doing is worth doing well and so we would love you to
throw your lot in with us and let us all create this masterpiece together.</p>
<p><b>5.  H</b><b>ow much we need and where
it's going...</b></p>
<p>For the completion of Episode 1 of Choices: an interactive
novel, we are looking to raise at least $6,000. We are keeping our fingers
crossed and hoping to surpass that amount but $6,000 is the barest minimum we
can use to do an incredible job. Here’s a breakdown of what we intend to use
that money for.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435835443/kyqx1gsclrswpolavjw3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Indiegogo fees – 7%</p>
<p>Perk fulfillment – 20%</p>
<p>Writers – 10%</p>
<p>Voice actors – 10%</p>
<p>Graphic artists – 25%</p>
<p>Music/sound engineers – 5%</p>
<p>Programmers – 20%</p>
<p>Miscellaneous – 3%</p>
<p>If we do surpass our target though, that will be a whole
other picnic altogether. Depending on how much we are able to raise, we could
even start work on Episodes 2 and 3! That will be so great!!</p>
<p><b>6.  </b><b>What you get...</b></p>
<p>“So, what’s in it for me if I give you my money?”</p>
<p>That’s the question running through your mind right about
now and we have an answer for that. We aren’t selfish individuals and we aren’t
looking for charity……… per se. You will definitely get something. It might not
be commensurate to the amount you are donating but please know that a lot of
thought went into it and every unique present carries a wealth of gratitude
from each and every one of us.</p>

<p><b>7.  Suppose we do not make our target..</b><b>.</b></p>
<p>If we do not reach our $6,000 goal, it’ll cause us a lot of
heartache but we will still complete the game. Because we did a lot
of number crunching before we arrived at $6,000. It is at this amount that we
can comfortably pay for all the perks, settle indiegogo fees and still be able
to output a finished project to the standards we want. </p><p>If we still don't achieve this target, we WILL finish the game, it might take a little longer than scheduled since we would have to raise the funds ourselves but we will ensure everyone gets the perks promised. </p>
<p>I sincerely believe we can reach that goal and surpass it
greatly though. </p>
<p><b>8.  </b><b>Why you should be involved in the development of this project...</b></p>
<p>I live in a part of the world where news of under-age
marriage, sexual abuse, violence against women, prostitution… to name just a
few, is really not news anymore. We’ve seen and encountered it so many times
that we’ve grown numb. Feeling indifferent about these evils doesn’t make them
any less horrible. Almost all the victims of these crimes suffer in silence.
The ones who dare voice out are told to be brave and endure it! Something is
horribly wrong with our psyche and our awareness. </p>
<p>Choices will provide players with first-hand experience of
what these voiceless victims are going through. We hope it brings about the re-education
our society so desperately needs. </p>

This is entirely mostly our fault since some unexpected personal issues came up which didn't allow us devote the time required to make this campaign a success.Never the less, we really appreciate everyone who contribuited, shared or supported us in any way. We have already directed most of you to request refunds before the camapign ends from Indiegogo.We will be keeping you updated on how we intend to proceed with this project in future. Thanks againElizabeth1.  A little background...
Hello. My name is Elizabeth Eremie and I am the founder of
Lizzie’s Creations. Lizzie’s Creations is a mobile app and game development
outfit that seeks to educate and entertain women and children using mobile
technology. We launched our outfit with the release of AfroTalez. It’s an
educative and interactive app for children that narrates African folk-stories.
When we launched it, it was a passion project but it received such acclaim that
we were honored and felt encouraged to go further.

2.  About our project...
For our next project, we would like to develop an episodic
game for women and young girls. Its titled ‘Choices’ and its an interactive

the story progresses further. Every choice will lead to a different ending. So
essentially, you can’t play it once, because every time you play and make a

<p>HMS (Hispania
Modelling Solutions) has accomplished great economic and resourceful efforts to
create the 3D design and make the “Graveyard Battle Arena” board physical
prototype.</p>
<p>All board parts have
been already printed in 3D using SLA technology (50 microns) and high
definition UV photo-hardening resins for a completely professional result.</p>
<p>Prototype has been
made with high quality PUR resins, the same materials that will be used in the
final production.</p>
<p>For the board
production we will use vacuum casting technology, completed with PUR resins in
pressure chamber.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can
proudly say that first two project phases (design and prototype) have been
successfully reached, so now we want to start with production phase.</p>

<p>By this time you may already
know this campaign is a platform to ease the “Graveyard Battle Arena”
pre-orders.</p>
<p><b>We offer you different options
to acquire the game board</b>, which you can see below in the <b>“perks” section</b>.</p>
<p>Of course, this campaign also
offers juicy rewards <b>(free)</b> for all backers, as you can see in the <b>“goals”</b> section
below.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466157388/BANNER_TEXTO_ALTO_-_Perks_k7yh9d.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;height: 301px;""/></p>
<p>Here you can find a detailed
list of all perks we offer you, including all content you will find in each of
them:</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466160761/BANNER_OPCION_-_Basic_option_ct6xp4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>(Assembly and painting not
included)</b>. If you choose this option, you will obtain tiles in resin,
demarcating board walls, and detailed instructions where we will let you know
step by step how to assemble the board and which other materials you will need
to give stability and consistency to the ensemble. <b>This option doesn’t include
magnetic tiles.</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466160958/PLANTILLA_-_Foto_despiece_BASIC_-_Pagina_01_j5fr4i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>(Assembly and painting not
included)</b>. With this option, in addition to the resin tiles and the demarcating
board walls, you will also get some plywood sheets, a frame for higher
stability and consistency, and a metallic sheet. With this option, all tiles
come with a magnetic base (expect walls, as they will always be fixed in the
same position): now your game board is steadier, more consistent and <b>versatile!</b>
Now you won’t have to resign yourself to a closed board configuration, as you
will be able to design alternative maps just changing the tiles in the board.
But this is not all, because with this perk option you assure your board will
be compatible with future board releases, as you will only need to change tiles
to enjoy new experiences.</p>
<p>Of course, this option also
includes a step by step guide so you can easily assemble your board.</p>

<div>Todas las piezas del tablero ya han sido impresas en 3D utilizando tecnología SLA (50 micras) y resinas de alta resolución fotocurables UV para que el resultado sea totalmente profesional.</div>
<div>El prototipo se ha fabricado en resinas PU de alta calidad. Estos mismos materiales son los que utilizaremos en la producción.</div>
<div>Para la producción del mismo utilizaremos tecnología de casteado al vacío y acabados en cámara de presión para resinas PU.</div>
<div>Por lo tanto, podemos decir con orgullo, que las dos primeras fases del proyecto (diseño y prototipo) han sido alcanzadas con éxito y tan sólo nos quedaría poner en marcha la producción.</div>

""Graveyard Battle Arena"" is the final result of
an ambitious project based in the design, making and production of a 3D
table-top game board, aiming the huge Battle Arena players’ community spread
all around the world.
Since a while ago we have been observing how this
large players’ community manage to play their games in printed paper boards, so
now we want to offer you the opportunity of having an attractive, versatile,
tough and quality board that will meet the expectations of the most demanding
players.

Playing area measures 40 x 40 cm. approximately.
Mounted board measures 50 x 50 cm. + 12 cm. height approximately.








HMS (Hispania
Modelling Solutions) has accomplished great economic and resourceful efforts to
create the 3D design and make the “Graveyard Battle Arena” board physical
prototype.
All board parts have
been already printed in 3D using SLA technology (50 microns) and high
definition UV photo-hardening resins for a completely professional result.
Prototype has been
made with high quality PUR resins, the same materials that will be used in the
final production.
For the board
production we will use vacuum casting technology, completed with PUR resins in
pressure chamber.
Therefore, we can
proudly say that first two project phases (design and prototype) have been
successfully reached, so now we want to start with production phase.






This campaign
intention is to ease to all those interested the purchase of our product in a
reliable and economic way, so we will start a production process based in
pre-orders. This method will allow us to acquire all the necessary materials
and equipment to create the boards with less cost, what will be reflected in
the product final price, which will be much cheaper than in future direct
sales. 
We achieve to slash
production prices thanks to the company Kudo 3D, a world-wide reference in SLA
printing who wants to support us being our exclusive sponsorship.

                                             
                      

Estimated time of
arrival will be December 2016.



By this time you may already
know this campaign is a platform to ease the “Graveyard Battle Arena”
pre-orders.
We offer you different options
to acquire the game board, which you can see below in the “perks” section.
Of course, this campaign also
offers juicy rewards (free) for all backers, as you can see in the “goals” section
below.

Here you can find a detailed
list of all perks we offer you, including all content you will find in each of
them:


(Assembly and painting not
included). If you choose this option, you will obtain tiles in resin,
demarcating board walls, and detailed instructions where we will let you know
step by step how to assemble the board and which other materials you will need
to give stability and consistency to the ensemble. This option doesn’t include
magnetic tiles.





(Assembly and painting not
included). With this option, in addition to the resin tiles and the demarcating
board walls, you will also get some plywood sheets, a frame for higher
stability and consistency, and a metallic sheet. With this option, all tiles
come with a magnetic base (expect walls, as they will always be fixed in the
same position): now your game board is steadier, more consistent and versatile!
Now you won’t have to resign yourself to a closed board configuration, as you
will be able to design alternative maps just changing the tiles in the board.
But this is not all, because with this perk option you assure your board will
be compatible with future board releases, as you will only need to change tiles
to enjoy new experiences.
Of course, this option also
includes a step by step guide so you can easily assemble your board.



(Painting required). This
option includes all offered in Full Option as well as the game board totally
assembled. We also include an attractive and tough box where you can keep and
carry your game board easily and safe.


With this option you will just
have to wait for your board, as we will send it totally assembled and painted
with an amazing quality, all ready to play. We also include the transportation
box included in FULL OPTION 2.






(In this attached image you can see the board
final look. Although they are not appearing in the image, you will receive
starting tiles and coins with your order. You can see how they look in the FULL
OPTION 2 rendered image)


CUSTOM BOARD PAINTING (only available for backers purchasing the LUXE OPTION). 
If you acquire this option, our team will customise the board following your instructions and taking as reference a colour palette we will publish during the campaign. Also, as an extra, we will include a metallic plate in one of the board’s sides carved with your name or whatever you prefer (30 characters maximum).

“Graveyard Battle Arena” is totally hand-made,
fabricated, casted, assembled and painted, so you could appreciate slightly
differences in the pieces final touch.

Due to this product features, its use is not
recommended for children under the age of 12 without adult supervision.

Shipping costs will be paid before shipment, and after
we contact to inform you about the total amount. This way both sides will have
a better control about the shipment.

                           CAMPAÑA EN ESPAÑOL





 


""Graveyard Battle Arena"" es el resultado final de un ambicioso proyecto basado en el diseño, fabricación y producción de un tablero de juego físico 3D, destinado a esa gran comunidad de jugadores de Battle Arena que hay repartidos por todo el mundo.

Desde hace mucho tiempo, hemos observado cómo esta numerosa comunidad de jugadores se las ingenia para poder jugar sus partidas en algo más que un mero tapete impreso. Por ese motivo queremos ofreceros la oportunidad de tener un tablero atractivo, versátil, resistente y de calidad que cumpla las expectativas de los más exigentes.
Medidas del área de juego 40 x 40 cm. aproximadamente.
Medidas del tablero montado 50 x 50 cm. + 12 cm. altura aproximadamente.








HMS (Hispania Modelling Solutions) ha realizado un gran esfuerzo tanto económico como en recursos humanos para crear el diseño 3D y fabricar el prototipo físico del tablero de juego ""Graveyard Battle Arena"". 
Todas las piezas del tablero ya han sido impresas en 3D utilizando tecnología SLA (50 micras) y resinas de alta resolución fotocurables UV para que el resultado sea totalmente profesional.
El prototipo se ha fabricado en resinas PU de alta calidad. Estos mismos materiales son los que utilizaremos en la producción.
Para la producción del mismo utilizaremos tecnología de casteado al vacío y acabados en cámara de presión para resinas PU.
Por lo tanto, podemos decir con orgullo, que las dos primeras fases del proyecto (diseño y prototipo) han sido alcanzadas con éxito y tan sólo nos quedaría poner en marcha la producción.




La intención de esta campaña es facilitar a todos los interesados la adquisición de nuestro producto de la forma más económica posible. Para ello pondremos en marcha un proceso de producción basado en pedidos formato pre-orders. 


Trabajar de esta manera nos va a permitir adquirir materiales y maquinaria para la producción de los tableros de juego a costos más reducidos. Este aspecto se verá reflejado en el precio final del producto, que siempre será mucho más económico que el ofrecido en una futura venta directa.
Además, 
Hemos conseguido abaratar considerablemente
los costes de producción gracias a que la empresa Kudo 3D (referente mundial en impresión SLA) ha apostado por
nuestro producto entrando como sponsor
exclusivo.
                          

El plazo de entrega estimado sería a lo largo del mes de diciembre del 2016.




Si habéis leído los apartados anteriores, ya tendréis claro que nuestra campaña es una plataforma para facilitaros los pedidos o pre-orders de ""Graveyard Battle Arena"".


Os ofrecemos distintas opciones para adquirir vuestro tablero de juego que os presentamos con más detalle en el apartado ""Opciones de Pedido"".

- ¿Esto quiere decir que no existen recompensas en esta campaña?
En absoluto, en esta campaña también vais a poder disfrutar de jugosas recompensas (totalmente gratuitas y desbloqueadas desde el primer momento) para todos los mecenas tal y como podréis comprobar en el apartado ""Metas"".




Aquí vais a encontrar una relación detallada de cada una de las opciones de pedido que tenemos a vuestra disposición así como del contenido incluido en cada una de ellas.



(Requiere montaje y pintado).   Si os decidís por esta opción, obtendréis todas las casillas en resina,  los muros que delimitan el tablero de juego, así como las instrucciones detalladas donde os indicaremos paso a paso, tanto el proceso de montaje, como el resto de materiales que os harían falta para dar más estabilidad y consistencia al conjunto. (En esta opción las casillas no son magnéticas),








(Requiere montaje y pintado). En esta opción, además de obtener todas las casillas en resina y los muros que delimitan el terreno de juego, también recibiréis varias láminas de contrachapado, un bastidor para aportar mayor estabilidad y consistencia al conjunto y una base metálica. A diferencia de la opción anterior, esta vez las casillas sí tienen base magnética (exceptuando los muros, ya que estos siempre serán fijos). Ahora vuestro tablero de juego es más estable, consistente y ¡¡ versátil !! Ya no tendréis que conformaros con una configuración cerrada, sino que podréis diseñar mapas alternativos simplemente cambiando la disposición de las casillas del tablero. Pero las posibilidades no terminan aquí, porque eligiendo esta opción, os aseguráis tener una base de juego totalmente compatible con futuros lanzamientos de nuevos tableros de juego, en los que tan sólo tendréis que sustituir unas casillas por otras para disfrutar de nuevas experiencias. 
Por supuesto, también incluimos las instrucciones paso a paso para que vosotros mismos podáis montar el conjunto fácilmente.






(Requiere pintado). Esta opción incluye todo lo que aparece en OPCIÓN FULL y además servimos el tablero de juego completamente montado. También incluimos una atractiva y resistente caja para poder guardar y transportar el tablero de juego de forma fácil y segura.



Con esta opción sólo tendréis que preocuparos de recibir vuestro tablero de juego y poneros a jugar al instante, porque os lo servimos completamente montado y pintado con unos acabados que os sorprenderán por su calidad. También incluimos la caja anteriormente mencionada en  la OPCIÓN FULL 2.



(Adjuntamos esta imagen, para que podáis ver de primera mano el acabado final del tablero. Aunque en esta imagen no aparezcan las casillas de salida ni las de monedas, en el tablero que recibiréis en vuestro domicilio si estarán presentes. Podéis ver el diseño de las mismas en el render mostrado en la opción FULL 2)



PINTADO DE TABLERO PERSONALIZADO (Sólo disponible para los mecenas que adquieran la OPCIÓN LUXE)


Al adquirir esta opción, nuestro equipo personalizará el tablero siguiendo  vuestras instrucciones y tomando como referencia una paleta de colores que publicaremos a lo largo de la campaña.
Además como extra, incluiremos una placa metálica en uno de los laterales del  tablero de juego en la que irá grabado   vuestro nombre o lo que deseéis (hasta 30 caracteres).



""Graveyard Battle Arena"" es un producto manufacturado, casteado, ensamblado y pintado a mano en su totalidad. Debido a ello pueden existir pequeñas diferencias de acabado entre piezas distintas de la misma producción.
Este es un producto que por su particularidad no es recomendable para ser usado por menores de 12 años de edad sin supervisión adulta.


Los gastos de envío se deberán abonar antes de enviar el pedido, y después de contactar con vosotros e indicaros el total requerido. De este modo, tanto los contribuyentes como nosotros tendremos más control sobre el envío.

<p>Game development is a difficult task. Because of various unforeseen events, it is common for game production to be delayed. I am doing everything I can to avoid extended deadlines or delayed development, but there is always a risk that this could happen. To keep you updated, I post regular articles about the progress on my DEV blog.</p>
<p>Another big problem is an unknown player base at this moment. It is a big difference to provide computer infrastructure for one hundred players and for one hundred thousand players. No one wants to play a game that is laggy and slow. Running crowdfunding campaigns is a great way to get at least a basic prediction for this.</p>
<p>With your help, I can deal with various obstacles that are in the way, and make sure you will be able to enjoy <strong>Next.Land</strong> soon.</p>

The Funds
All funds raised by the crowdfunding campaign will be used primary for computer and network infrastructure. With a solid server performance the game will be able to run without issues. Insufficient server performance could disappoint many players and ruin the gameplay completely. Below you can see some basic distribution of your money raised in the campaign.


Developing a game is a costly business. I have already invested a lot of resources into this project and I will keep doing this, but your help is very welcome. All I can do is to provide you as much information as possible so you are able to decide on your support.
 
The Team
I am the creator and the only developer right now. Next.Land is my personal project that I started developing in my free time. I can not compete with top video game makers and bring you the ultimate gameplay, graphics or whatever. I just want to bring you a simple game that is fun to play. I hope that this game will become popular and I will be able to expand the team and bring you an even better gaming experience.

 
Risks & Challenges
Game development is a difficult task. Because of various unforeseen events, it is common for game production to be delayed. I am doing everything I can to avoid extended deadlines or delayed development, but there is always a risk that this could happen. To keep you updated, I post regular articles about the progress on my DEV blog.
Another big problem is an unknown player base at this moment. It is a big difference to provide computer infrastructure for one hundred players and for one hundred thousand players. No one wants to play a game that is laggy and slow. Running crowdfunding campaigns is a great way to get at least a basic prediction for this.
With your help, I can deal with various obstacles that are in the way, and make sure you will be able to enjoy Next.Land soon.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
I totally understand that some people just can't contribute. Don't worry, Next.Land is a free to play game. You will get a full, unrestricted access even with a non-premium account. There are still other ways you can help:

Tell your friends about the game
Use social media - subscribe to YouTube channel or tweet about the game
Send me a message with your ideas

Anyways, the best way how to help is just to play this game and have fun!

I've learned C/C++ programming back in high-school and developed a passion for it, later learning additional programming languages with the purpose of creating smaller apps for local small businesses, mostly for accounting purposes. Another one of my passions is drawing comics and recently figured out a way to put these two hobbies together in the shape of 2D game development using Unity.</p><p>In my city, there are no other companies in this business so I proposed to open the first one, however the financial strain is proving to be greater than anticipated and here we are.</p><p>As much as I would like to be able to do all the aspects of a game myself, there are some domains in which there is either a great amount or simply beyond my skills such as music, sound effect, voice recording or marketing and this is where you come in.</p><p><strong><u>What is Shady Woods all about?</u></strong><br/>The story follows the adventure of a young girl named Daisy in a mysterious forest filled with dangerous monsters as she tries to find out how she got there and how she can get out. She is followed by her trusty companion, Mildred, who is a demonic squirrel with bat wings, believing that Daisy is the Destroyer Queen whom he has pledged to serve, despite Daisy denying this from the beginning. They meet several ""shady"" individuals on their path, often times being something other than what they claim to be. Daisy soon finds out that she is not in just any kind of forest and getting out will be harder than she imagined.</p><p>Game mechanics are your average platformer with an ever changing environment, eastereggs for the story and hidden chambers in the walls with extra loot. You have 3 spells (a ranged attack, a melee attack, and a shield) each costing mana to cast. Daisy has a talent tree and a spell tree that she can improve using 3 kind of in-game currencies: acorns, shards and herbs thus rising to the challenge of each level. At the end of every level there will be an additional line of comics-strips unlocking for the player to follow the story and at the end of every second level there will be a Boss, who at times can prove as quite a challenge for players. The proposed number of levels is 24 at this time.</p><p><u><strong>What you can do:</strong></u><br/>- SPREAD THE WORD! Arguably the most important part here is to build an audience for the game that will inevitably be created at some point in the near future.<br/>- If you are a musician or voice actor and you want to help, please contact me!<br/>- Donate.</p><p><strong><u>What your donations will be spent on:</u></strong><br/>- Paying outsourced artists (currently working in collaboration with 1 artist with an hourly wage of approximately 4 euro).<br/>- Digital Art equipment (I own a wacom intous 5 tablet which is about 4-5 years old and not the best option for a wannabe professional game dev)<br/>- Paying the monthly fee of Unity Plus license<br/>- Paying for advertisement<br/><br/><u><strong>Why help?</strong></u><br/>By aiding this project, you will help build a company in an ever growing industry, which will provide a workplace for local digital artists, programmers, voice actors and offering courses in these domains for local youngsters, that are passionate about it.<br/>I'm not sure what the limitations for this platform are, but I will try to send a promo-codes to everyone who donates at least 5  euros, so that when the game launches, they can play it for free. Additionally, anyone who helps out in the en-devour will have a special place in an easter-egg of the game as well as the due credits.</p><p>At the end of the campaign, the person who donated the largest amount will have a character designed after them.</p></div>","Who am I?My name is Laszlo and I'm 26 years old.

She is followed by her trusty companion, Mildred, who is a demonic squirrel with bat wings, believing that Daisy is the Destroyer Queen whom he has pledged to serve, despite Daisy denying this from the beginning. They meet several ""shady"" individuals on their path, often times being something other than what they claim to be. Daisy soon finds out that she is not in just any kind of forest and getting out will be harder than she imagined.Game mechanics are your average platformer with an ever changing environment, eastereggs for the story and hidden chambers in the walls with extra loot. You have 3 spells (a ranged attack, a melee attack, and a shield) each costing mana to cast. Daisy has a talent tree and a spell tree that she can improve using 3 kind of in-game currencies: acorns, shards and herbs thus rising to the challenge of each level. At the end of every level there will be an additional line of comics-strips unlocking for the player to follow the story and at the end of every second level there will be a Boss, who at times can prove as quite a challenge for players. The proposed number of levels is 24 at this time.What you can do:- SPREAD THE WORD! Arguably the most important part here is to build an audience for the game that will inevitably be created at some point in the near future.- If you are a musician or voice actor and you want to help, please contact me!- Donate.What your donations will be spent on:- Paying outsourced artists (currently working in collaboration with 1 artist with an hourly wage of approximately 4 euro).- Digital Art equipment (I own a wacom intous 5 tablet which is about 4-5 years old and not the best option for a wannabe professional game dev)- Paying the monthly fee of Unity Plus license- Paying for advertisementWhy help?By aiding this project, you will help build a company in an ever growing industry, which will provide a workplace for local digital artists, programmers, voice actors and offering courses in these domains for local youngsters, that are passionate about it.I'm not sure what the limitations for this platform are, but I will try to send a promo-codes to everyone who donates at least 5  euros, so that when the game launches, they can play it for free. Additionally, anyone who helps out in the en-devour will have a special place in an easter-egg of the game as well as the due credits.At the end of the campaign, the person who donated the largest amount will have a character designed after them.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>        </strong>The idea of ​​this game came to us while we were passing the logic test on programming at the beginning of our studying.

This is how the creation of “ PathFinder” began.</p>
<p><strong>        </strong> So the key goal of the project is <strong>to create an educational and entertaining game</strong> for users of different ages. Yes, everyone can be addicted to this game for a long time!</p>

<p><strong>        </strong>The key mechanic of the game <strong>is building a path</strong> for the main character (Slime), with the condition to collect all the stars. Importantly, you don’t have to move Slime in real time. You <strong>have to compose an algorithm for its path along the platforms</strong>, start the movement and look at the result. Various tools are available to you to build a path: starting with banal turns and forward movements, repainting platforms and including more complex mechanics, such as repeating certain tasks (functions).</p>
<p><strong>        </strong>So the user, using the toolbar, fills the input panel and starts the movement of the slime. After collecting all stars, the level will be completed. For a more comfortable game and stifle the level view, we have made 3 map view modes.</p>

We will need 10 000 to make this project come to life. With those funds I will use it to buy gaming equipment, brew equipment, and  paying our talented staff who have worked so hard. We will also start on our comic project. 
We have come up with some amazing prizes for those who contribute to the campaign.  We have worked with local small business to bring you the best items.  By supporting us you will help support local communities. We have the ultimate guide to making nerdy cocktails, the secret of the ooze, the dragon of the darkness flame, Stay puff Marshmallow man, and the Hadoken. We have glasses , beer mugs, and cocktail makers to make your amazing cocktails. We have a custom made magneto helmet for mutants to bend metal. Once we hit our stretch goals, we are going to offer some more amazing rewards. 
If we are not able to reach our goal that means we will have to look at taking on loans. We  will have less money for our team and equipment. 


The Impact
By helping us fund this project, you will help other creators on our team get their dreams off the ground. We will be able to expand our project and create our own content that is original and fresh. 

Our team wants to create a place where any one can play retro games that are hard to find, new games, vr, without paying a fortune.  
We have gone to comic conventions , and we have been very successful. 
This will help out other small business and bring jobs to our community. 


Risks & Challenges
This is a large undertaking with a lot of moving parts to it. Its going to take a lot of money to get this of the ground. This project may not get enough funding , and we may have to take on a lot of debt. 

I have worked hard to gain momentum in the community, and have gained support with influences.  
We plan to get over these hurdles by getting expert advice and learning from our mistakes.  I will also not give up.

 And of course, we want the game to have a lot of enemies! Like:

bodyguards: mildly armed

policemen: armed, and they know how to handle a gun

army men: heavily armed

hitmen: prepare to die

normal people: well, some may be gun addicts, you never know
zombies (maybe? depends if players find them interesting enough, tell us what you think!)
aliens (maybe? same as zombies)
All enemies will be fully animated with a variety of unpredictable movement sets and with a deadly AI.The game is a FPS so expect to see some gore. Blood spilling and sound effects of flesh being hit will be carefully chosen and tailored to provide an immersive experience. Some blood is already in the demo, try it! The bodyguard spares no one! Do not spill blood in vain, donate it instead #brotipWe want to develop at least two Game Modes:

Survivor Mode: duel a series of enemies until you are defeated (or not?)

Shooting Range (and/or minigames): to test guns and rack high scores
One may ask why don't we stick only to a western type of game, more suitable for duels? As fans of FPS games, we feel that we would be very limited if we stuck only to old guns and western-type locations. As players, we want variety, we want freedom to choose the guns we like most and above all, we want YOU TO HAVE FUN!Ultimately, we want to publish the game on Steam, or at an indie game website, like itch.io (the demo is already there!).  Why do we need to raise funds?To put it shortly: the more beautiful and detailed assets are paid. So part of the funding will be devoted to buy the best assets to deliver a high level of detail and fine tune the experience.Some gun models, which are extremely well done, cost a few dollars (USD 5-10) to some dozens of dollars (USD 50+). The same for props which are used in the environments. Blood and sound effects which are professionally recorded cost some more as well. Unfortunately, there's a limit to what can be achieved with free assets, so we feel that fundraising is needed. We expect to buy at least 500-1000 dollars of assets depending on how much we can raise.Extremely detailed weapons, such this Desert Eagle are paid (image credit Black Light Studio from Unity Asset Store https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/conten...)Another part of the funding will be used to pay myself for my work. I guarantee that I will work at least part time on this game - about 20h per week for a few months. And pay a cut to my 2 partners who helped me get the Vive for development. Without them, this demo would not even exist!Help us make all of this happen! Let's build the VR shooter we all wanted together! Early backers can get the full game at a discount price! #brotip  Roughly, we divided the features by difficulty of development and how much value they will add to the game. This is what we have planned depending on how much we can raise:

1000 ~ 2500 USD raised
Better voices: new enemy voices, new player voices
Better enemy animations: a more diverse set of movements
Different bodyguard enemies: 3 or 4 in total
Arena: Rooftops
Arena: Coliseum
2 pistols (made with free assets)
4 machine guns (made with free assets)



2500 ~ 5000 USD raised
Improve enemy AI: more fine tuned according to level of difficulty
Arena: Office
Arena: Bridge Ruins
Better blood effects: persistent blood, better blood splatters
Better sound effects: more varied gun sounds, ricochets etc




5000 ~ 7500 USD raised
Fire bullet prefabs: for better visual effects when shooting
Paid weapons: extremely detailed and gorgeous weapons will be added
Arena: Desert
Arena: Low Poly World



7500 ~ 10000 USD raised
Weapon animations: gun cocking, more fine details on gun behavior
Shooting Range: game mode
Army Enemy: a very lethal one, with heavy guns
Publish on Steam


That's not a ""set in stone"" list of features, but a ballpark estimate. We may change the timings if we feel that some feature will be more interesting for the game than others and end up developing them first. But rest assured that we will only change the estimates for the better! We can add more features to the list as well.Do we intend to put online features? That would be awesome indeed, but we will work on such features only if we can raise the campaign value, as stretch goals. We understand that players like PvP, Coop and Online Leaderboards so it will not be ignored if the campaign fares well.  This demo was developed as a final project for Udacity's VR Nanodegree. So at this point, it's a one man work only. It took me about 120 hours of scavenging free assets on Unity Asset Store and programming to be able to materialize a small portion of what I had in mind. And I coded everything myself: the shooting algorithms, the enemy AI and the design of the Western Arena.In every step of its making, I had in mind that we wanted the game to be expanded and released commercially. I say we, because of the two partners that helped me buy the Vive to complete the course and be able to develop and deliver VR experiences.I worked full time as a software developer (mostly with Java and JS) for more than 10 years, so I'm confident that I can and I will deliver everything enumerated in the feature list (subject to fundraising values). Depending on the funding level, I can get one more person with a similar background to mine and we can speed up the development process. In this case, said person will be one of my two partners.In case we can't reach the initial 10,000 USD intended, we will take what was raised and develop everything that was listed up to the value raised.  A Udacity project reviewer said:""One word to describe your project - Excellent! It can be seen that you have kept a lot of time and effort in crafting this project. Very much appreciated. The user testing you did really helped in keeping high detail into the game (bullet shells and non-infinite bullets). I also liked the lighting in your game, the enemy AI and the audio. (...) Your game clearly gives a different experience! I loved it.""This gave us more confidence that the game is heading in the right direction and it will be a diverse and fun experience for the players!  Please share this project on Facebook, Twitter, e-mail (use the share tools on this campaign, they are neat!), spread word about it! We will be very grateful!Follow our updates and our evolution on the campaign as well! Disclaimer*The demo may not reflect the final game. We intend to make it BETTER!*We do not condone gun violence! It's a game and as such, have fun with it just as a game only! (suggested for a more mature audience, 16, 18 or 21 years old, depending on your country)*HTC Vive headset not included.

This campaign is about helping to develop a game in its entirety.
Our game with the name ""180 Seconds"" is in early access. At the moment we only have 1 scenario, we need funds to be able to obtain physical as well as digital materials, in order to develop other scenarios in the game, use better graphics and more sound effects.
Here is the link to our game in Early Access, available for android on the Play Store. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=c...
How will the money raised in this campaign be used? 
Most of the money will go towards paying everyone working on the project and the features mentioned earlier..
Part of the money will be used to pay for any software licenses and hardware necessary for development of the game.
4. RISKS & CHALLENGES                        For the development of the demo, most of the main game features were already implemented, and the few mechanics that do need to be added are not likely to pose a problem.In terms of game development, I’ve already moved to counter my biggest risks: 
I’ve produced a demo that represents a full vertical slice of gameplay, with all core systems in place. This means that of the work remaining, it’s almost entirely content, and I already have workflows and internal tools in place to rapidly build more.
I’ve scoped out the content of the game, determined how much development time each element needs, and based my campaign budget on that. I’ve also taken some content I wanted to have in the core game and positioned it as a stretch goal, leaving just the minimum scope needed to produce my envisioned end-product.
I’m not tackling tasks that are complete question marks, like porting to consoles. While for Switch sounds amazing. I’ll be focusing on what I can account for and developing for PC first, after that, revisit consoles. 
               For the aspects of development I’m less familiar with – namely, technical behind-the-scenes work like memory management and hardware support – I’ve cultivated a network of fellow developers who regularly exchange advice and guidance (which I also contribute to!). For these types of new hurdles, I’ve found a bit of direction getting started is enough to let me run with it again. For this reason I formed a team.               Our team is made up of talented developers, composers, artists, programmers and system analysts. We all share the same vision.AND NOW WE ARE HERE:Josemar Benvindo Pedro - Game Design and DeveloperRicardo Miranda - ProgrammerOtiniel Kamu - Systems AnalystCarlos Peres - Artist and Technical AnimatorSony Francisco - ComposerEud Bernardo - Biologist",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Gnome More War</strong> is an action shooter/castle defense hybrid for Android and iOS devices. It was mainly inspired by one of my childhood favorite NES games: <strong>Pooyan</strong>.</p>

<p>It wasn't a very big hit even back then, but it stuck with me somehow. With the advent of castle defense games on mobile phones, I immediately got reminded of the game and I thought it will feel at home on mobile devices. Of course, I didn't want to just clone a game. Instead what I did is take the elements of Pooyan that I liked and added my own designs on top.</p>
<p>The output is a castle defense game in the sense that you as the player will have to fend off incoming gnomes who plan to steal your chickens, ducks, pigs, etc. from your barn. The way you will defend your farm is by shooting at them while they parachute down to the ground, hence the action shooter part. You will be equipped with an arsenal of power-ups to help you survive and at the same time shoot as much gnomes as possible. Furthermore, you will be able to mix and match upgrades from armor enhancements to recruiting your goblin friends as support fire.</p>

<p>You may be wondering, ""If the game is already playable, why start a funding campaign?"". Actually, despite working on the game to the point of completion, there are still features that I would like to add, and for me to be able to add them as soon as possible, I will need help from you guys! It took me two years to get to this point and that's because I've been doing this on my very limited free time. With proper funding, I can finally focus on my passion project, improve it, polish it, and release a game that I know players will enjoy.</p>
<p>As it stands, the game already has 3 maps, fully populated with <strong>19 gnomes</strong> across the board. While I think the number is balanced and diverse enough, what I really wanted to add are <strong>Boss fights</strong><strong>. </strong>This would complete the map experience.</p>
<p>I think it would be cool to get to fight a boss from time to time throughout the level. These bosses will have to be diverse, so additional time for the artwork, sound, and programming will be much needed.</p>

<h2><i>What happens if I fail to reach my target funding?</i></h2>
<p>The game will be released either way, but it will be on Android only, and there will be no boss battles :(</p>
<p>It goes without saying, but none of the stretch goals will see the light of day, unless I can find another way to fund the development.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I want to do more-- much, much more. If ever I exceed my <i>Tier 1</i> target funding I will add a new map that will play more like a <strong><i>Zen Mode</i></strong>. In this mode, there will be no worry from dying or having your chickens stolen from you. All you will need to do is pop as many balloons as you can within the given time. You will have to reorganize your upgrades deck and equip a different set of power-ups to get the highest score possible and lead the global leaderboard!</p>

<p>I am Lorie Jay Gutierrez, from the Philippines. I'm 35 years old as of this writing, and I am a professional software engineer for about 15 years. I'm proficient in C and C++, mainly for embedded systems. I'm also knowledgeable of Java (Android, Enterprise), HTML, C#, and so on. I am a gamer since the NES days, growing up on coin-op arcade boxes. My favorite genres are RTS and RPGs, and I want to be able to develop and release such games in the future, when they're feasible.</p>
<p>In college I used to make small mini games using C, C++, or Java. I started tinkering with game making engines in 2003, when I stumbled upon RPG Maker and RPG Toolkit.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Another game I made in the past</i></p>

<p>I am <strong>Hobbi Games</strong>. I do all art, design, programming, and music myself and would love to get to the point where I could hire other talented people to help me with some of the stuff. All games I've made in the past were done in my spare time. As you can imagine, having a full time programming job leaves me with little free time to do what I really want-- which is to make games.</p>

<h2><i>Risks &amp; challenges</i></h2>
<p>I'm no Iwata, Kojima, or Igarashi. My professional experience is from software engineering, and game development has been more of a hobby for me. This will be the first time that I'm gonna work on my passion project while under pressure (e.g. deadlines), but I'm confident It won't be a problem for me. I've been used to dealing and beating deadlines for 15 years, and those weren't even the type of work I'm remotely interested in.</p>
<p>As for designing games, I'm also relatively new at it, but with everyone's help I'm sure I will be able to develop and release a fun game many people will love.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><i>On a final note...</i></h2>
<p>I hope by this point I have convinced you to help fund my project, but in case you're still on the fence, just hear me out one last time.</p>
<p>If this project isn't really your cup of tea, have I at least impressed you in any way? If I did, then think of your contribution, no matter the amount, as a statement of how much you believe in my potential. I dream of making bigger and better games that's more in line with my own favorite genres and that would potentially resonate with a wider audience. Furthermore, this project might just be the break that I need to finally transition to a full-time game developer. Nothing beats having a job that you actually love, than the one that pays the rent, right? I have been working for 15 years now, and while my job is in no way bad (it's great, actually), it still doesn't give me the same creative high as making a game. This is me taking the risk by leaving the safer road to follow my own dream.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2><i>Other ways you can help</i></h2>
<p>Are you ready to back my project? That's awesome! Can't fund my project? No problem! You can help me further by sharing my game and campaign to your friends who might be interested. Please help me spread the word.</p>

And finally, you will be part of the actual gameplay as a gnome! Just send me a picture of yourself and I will create a gnome in your image. Now you and all the other players will see a bunch of yourself running around, stealing chickens.

This could be you!
 
 
What happens if I fail to reach my target funding?
The game will be released either way, but it will be on Android only, and there will be no boss battles :(
It goes without saying, but none of the stretch goals will see the light of day, unless I can find another way to fund the development.
 
 

 
I want to do more-- much, much more. If ever I exceed my Tier 1 target funding I will add a new map that will play more like a Zen Mode. In this mode, there will be no worry from dying or having your chickens stolen from you. All you will need to do is pop as many balloons as you can within the given time. You will have to reorganize your upgrades deck and equip a different set of power-ups to get the highest score possible and lead the global leaderboard!

Further funding will enable me to add more maps, more enemy types, and more bosses! Hell, I might even be able to port the game to the Nintendo Switch.
 

 
I am Lorie Jay Gutierrez, from the Philippines. I'm 35 years old as of this writing, and I am a professional software engineer for about 15 years. I'm proficient in C and C++, mainly for embedded systems. I'm also knowledgeable of Java (Android, Enterprise), HTML, C#, and so on. I am a gamer since the NES days, growing up on coin-op arcade boxes. My favorite genres are RTS and RPGs, and I want to be able to develop and release such games in the future, when they're feasible.
In college I used to make small mini games using C, C++, or Java. I started tinkering with game making engines in 2003, when I stumbled upon RPG Maker and RPG Toolkit.


An unreleased game I was making

Another game I made in the past
Nowadays I use Unity to develop my games, which you can check out through my website (http://hobbigames.com)
I am Hobbi Games. I do all art, design, programming, and music myself and would love to get to the point where I could hire other talented people to help me with some of the stuff. All games I've made in the past were done in my spare time. As you can imagine, having a full time programming job leaves me with little free time to do what I really want-- which is to make games.
I truly wish this is the start of the realization of my life long dream. I've got loads of ideas that I want to put out there in the world for everyone to enjoy.
Thank you for the time!
Cheers,
LJ
 

Risks & challenges
I'm no Iwata, Kojima, or Igarashi. My professional experience is from software engineering, and game development has been more of a hobby for me. This will be the first time that I'm gonna work on my passion project while under pressure (e.g. deadlines), but I'm confident It won't be a problem for me. I've been used to dealing and beating deadlines for 15 years, and those weren't even the type of work I'm remotely interested in.
As for designing games, I'm also relatively new at it, but with everyone's help I'm sure I will be able to develop and release a fun game many people will love.
 
On a final note...
I hope by this point I have convinced you to help fund my project, but in case you're still on the fence, just hear me out one last time.
If this project isn't really your cup of tea, have I at least impressed you in any way? If I did, then think of your contribution, no matter the amount, as a statement of how much you believe in my potential. I dream of making bigger and better games that's more in line with my own favorite genres and that would potentially resonate with a wider audience. Furthermore, this project might just be the break that I need to finally transition to a full-time game developer. Nothing beats having a job that you actually love, than the one that pays the rent, right? I have been working for 15 years now, and while my job is in no way bad (it's great, actually), it still doesn't give me the same creative high as making a game. This is me taking the risk by leaving the safer road to follow my own dream.
 

Other ways you can help
Are you ready to back my project? That's awesome! Can't fund my project? No problem! You can help me further by sharing my game and campaign to your friends who might be interested. Please help me spread the word.

 will also be able to control your units with the swipe of a finger, 
which is a very refreshing addition to this game. In pre-battle mode you
 can organize your troops into smaller groups to be able to control them
 easier throughout the battle.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Features of the Game:</strong><br/><br/>Era: Roman Empire <br/><br/><strong>Story line:</strong>
 You have been sent by Caesar to establish a new Roman Settlement for 
the purpose of helping secure the newly conquered land. This is a wild 
and dangerous land. You need to make sure you prepare your Settlement to
 defend off attacks from unfriendly Settlements. You are given the 
authority to attack anyone you see fit for the glory of the Empire. <br/><br/><strong>Buildings:</strong>
 Everything will be based off the Roman style. Market, Marble Quarries, 
Iron works, Castra (which can house 150 troops), Academy etc. <br/><br/><strong>Builders:</strong>
 We want the user to start off with two builders. This allows the user 
to build more than one building at a time, from the start. By having two
 builders at the beginning it will also let us show the user the new 
feature. <br/><br/><strong>Builders can be stacked!!</strong> Example: If I
 upgrade my Marble Quarry to level 5, it will take 24 hours to complete 
with just one builder. I can take a second builder and add him to the 
project thus diminishing the project by a quarter of the time (from 24 
hours to 18 hours). I could then add a 3rd or 4th builder as well. <br/><br/><strong>Resources</strong>: The two main resources for now will be Marble and Iron. <br/><br/><strong>Troops:</strong>
 We have a special plan for troops. Troops sent into battle, whether you
 win, lose, or retreat, will not be lost if they haven’t died. Players 
will not have to save up and spend resources to upgrade troops. Troops 
will be upgraded by the experience they gain from battles. They will 
gain more experience from winning than from losing. Troops can also be 
upgraded from another vital aspect – the Academy. By placing troops in 
the Academy, the user is giving them up for “X” amount of time. If a 
troop is in the Academy they will gain experience 5X faster than a troop
 who fights in battle. The different units will also change in 
appearance as they level up. <br/><br/>The troops will of course be Roman 
style: Legionary – Infantry, Praetorians- Heavy Infantry, Archers, 
Auxiliary Archers (Archers on horses), Catapults, Rams, Trebuchets, 
Pikeman etc. Each one will be worth a certain number of troops. 
Defences/Traps: Archer towers, Trebuchets on walls, Boiling pots of Oil 
on walls, Massive wooden-spiked bear traps hidden underground, Ballista,
 Attack Dogs, Walls (Up-gradable from wood poles to Stone Walls) etc. <br/><br/><strong>Player vs. Player:</strong>
 In other mobile strategy games, you can only attack a person when they 
are offline. In this game, not only will players be able to 
attack/revenge a person while they are online but the player being 
attacked can use up to ¼ of his army to defend himself. A player can 
also place ¼ of his army to defend him while he is offline too. <br/><br/><strong>Card integration</strong>:
 When you attack a village and win you get a random card that can be 
either defensive or offensive. When attacking, a player can use an 
offensive card to give him a slight advantage.  A Defender can also use a
 card when attacked and store a card to be used while offline.<br/><br/><strong>Morale Meter:</strong>
 In Rome, when the army returned from war, the city was excited and the 
troop and citizen’s morale was boosted. We want to integrate this into 
the game. We would like to have a “Morale Meter” located somewhere on 
the screen. When the Meter is at 0% the Iron and Marble mines are at 
normal mining rate. When it is at 100% the rate of mining is doubled. 
Also, when the meter is kept at between 95-100% for a certain period of 
time, Caesar will send a special gift to the player –Denarii. The way to
 make the Meter go up is by winning attacks. When you win, it goes up 
and when you lose to many times in a row, it comes down a little. Also, 
doing nothing causes the Meter to go down.<br/><br/><strong>Gems:</strong> We are calling them Denarii based off of what the Romans called their coins. <strong>We do not want to make the mistake of other developers and build the game around the “gem concept”.</strong>
 This is where a lot of game apps have failed/frustrated their users. 
Instead, game-play will be the main focus. Rewarding users for playing 
the game, rather than forcing them to use ""Gems"" because they feel like 
they're not getting anywhere.<br/><br/><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/><br/>We
 are truly looking forward to bringing this game to the community and we
 are looking for support from everyone who is a fan of games that foster
 strategic planning and help exercise the mind.<br/><br/><strong>The only 
way this is possible is by your support!  As soon as we get the funding 
our development team in Texas will immediately start the development 
stage. </strong><br/></p></div>","We are creating a game app, for Android and Apple, that

<p>As you can see in pictures, that's all I could make atm, but it is playable game and it is super fun!</p>
<p>About the game: </p>
<p>I made a strategic/economy/train based game that I call atm ""Trains"". The game is for 2-4 players and the main goal is to finish your main objective.</p>
<p>Game it self lasts about 1:30 - 2:30 mins. There is shorter version,  for about an hour, if you set the goal to complete the mini objective or maybe treasure hunt objective.</p>
<p>My brothers/friends and me already played it over dozen times and its really great! There is needed some fine detailing in balance goods/costs.</p>
<p>Each player starts from his corner ( each corner produces different basic goods, such as lumber/wool/milk/cow or so), get random mini objective and some $.<br/>Before you take at random hero (mechanic, economist, smugler....) you gotta buy your first train, either to go with fast/but less wagons or slow/more wagons train.</p>
<p>The journey starts and from there it's unpredictable! </p>
<p>There are weather effects vs roll, engine breaks vs roll, lottery tickets and traps.</p>
<p>It's ment for pve playing style, but also you can buy in auction house, mine or oil deposits (which costs ofc, and its bid based, so you can end giving alot of money if other players all the time outbids) and then you get half the income for every delivery in that mine/oil deposits! Pvp part would also be traps.</p>
<p>Some other heroes/stuff will be implemented if the goal is achieved and then the journey can start! :)</p>

my name is Igor Galic. I come from Zagreb, Croatia, and by proffesion I'm a music teacher. :)Main goal of this project is to achieve my goal, to make this board game alive and so can all enjoy it one day.

<h3>What's all about?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi again! Let me introduce myself...  my name is Matt and I am young artist from Poland and basically I have a great idea to help people with making beautiful looking games!</li>
<li>I want to make a package of <strong>70+ art assets</strong> for isometric fantasy games with <strong>You</strong>.</li>
<li>With <strong>your</strong> help I can achive it 10 times faster and better than I would do it alone.</li>
<li>Here you can find and download early prototype of the project <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzHhi7W_d2W_QmU1a3k5cFMteVU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzHhi7W_d2W_Q...</a>
</li>
<li>So far I made about 17% of the whole project. With your help I will create list of assets that will be included in the package.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>My goal is 1800$ and I want to spend this money on things that will help me with development procces. The most important for me is to get a new drawing tablet to improve quality of assets, next I will buy licenses for programms.  Rest of money I will save for my living because I work full time and I would like to limit my regular job time to the minimum and focus on 100% on this project.</li>
<li>
<strong>Be Creator!</strong> The most important is the fact that you will contribute to the creation process. Simply we will co create the whole package. Starting from list of objects, concepts we will start making our unique world and you will get acces to assets before the be realsed. You will get chance to give me huge feedback and some of you will get the whole package for free and some extra illustrations with dedication.</li>
<li>If I will not get to 1800$ which with your generosity I hope is not going to happend, I will spend money on the development procces and licenses. I'm going to finish assets and realse it on unity assets store anyway, but it will take probably much more time.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Just Imagine</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maybe you are indie game developer and you have a great idea for an amazing game but unfortunately you lack art skills. And what if all you need will be available to you soon.  Just imagine an abundance of assets to use like crates, rocks, dungeons, buildings, trees, villages, small towns, paths, camps, ruins ... It will all be available to you and you will be able to release your creativity.</li>
<li>
<strong>Make Your Own Games </strong>like never before and share it to the world!</li>
<li>The idea is to make it as simple as it possible for amateurs and professionals. You can use these assets for mobile, pc games or even board games!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>You will not find any risks here but a lot of challenges. First of all remember that im not asking you just for some money but I'm asking you for <strong>Help.</strong>  I want you to be co-creator of this project so the challenge is for us to make something amazing!</li></ul>

Here you can find and download early prototype of the project https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzHhi7W_d2W_Q...

So far I made about 17% of the whole project. With your help I will create list of assets that will be included in the package.


What I Need & What You Get
 

My goal is 1800$ and I want to spend this money on things that will help me with development procces. The most important for me is to get a new drawing tablet to improve quality of assets, next I will buy licenses for programms.  Rest of money I will save for my living because I work full time and I would like to limit my regular job time to the minimum and focus on 100% on this project.

Be Creator! The most important is the fact that you will contribute to the creation process. Simply we will co create the whole package. Starting from list of objects, concepts we will start making our unique world and you will get acces to assets before the be realsed. You will get chance to give me huge feedback and some of you will get the whole package for free and some extra illustrations with dedication.
If I will not get to 1800$ which with your generosity I hope is not going to happend, I will spend money on the development procces and licenses. I'm going to finish assets and realse it on unity assets store anyway, but it will take probably much more time.


Just Imagine

Maybe you are indie game developer and you have a great idea for an amazing game but unfortunately you lack art skills. And what if all you need will be available to you soon.  Just imagine an abundance of assets to use like crates, rocks, dungeons, buildings, trees, villages, small towns, paths, camps, ruins ... It will all be available to you and you will be able to release your creativity.

Make Your Own Games like never before and share it to the world!
The idea is to make it as simple as it possible for amateurs and professionals. You can use these assets for mobile, pc games or even board games!


Risks & Challenges
 
You will not find any risks here but a lot of challenges. First of all remember that im not asking you just for some money but I'm asking you for Help.  I want you to be co-creator of this project so the challenge is for us to make something amazing!

<p>Who are we?</p>
<p>We are a new startup that focuses on running gaming tournaments. We come from Hearthstone scene and that is why we focus mainly on Hearthstone tournaments at the moment. Since the development of our platform, we have run dozens of tournaments. We were able to get our tournaments licensed for HCT (World championship) points that hundreds of players could compete for while also being able to win prize money. </p>
<p>Our goal of this campaign is to fund our first big Hearthstone Lan tournament with one of the best Hearthstone competitors in the world, the best casting talent and great production so everyone around the world can enjoy watching it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is Esportlair Cup?</h3>
<p>Esportlair Cup is a $20 000 prizepool Hearthstone tournament with 8 invited pros and 8 qualified players that will take place in a small villa near Prague for 3 days. Planned date of the event is 20th-22nd of April 2018, right after the new Hearthstone expansion comes out. The whole tournament will be broadcasted live on twitch.tv and our first invite is Stan Cifka who is at the moment No. 3 in the world. We will be releasing names of our other invites every 3 days but I can already tell you that it is stacked.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can you participate?</h3>
<p>There are two options. First one is for the competitive types. If that is you, there is a way to qualify for the tournament. The qualifier will have 512 spots, which you can get by contributing to our campaign with the ""Player"" perk. The format of the qualifier will be 9 rounds swiss, best of 5 Conquest with 1 class ban. Top 7-8 (depends on the ""Crazy player"" perk) will qualify for the main event. All of the players that will qualify for the main event will have their travels and accommodations paid for by us. </p>
<p>If you are more of an observer type. You can participate just by watching the tournament once it will run in April on Twitch. But for that to happen, first we need to reach our campaign goal. Even though  55% of the campaign goal will come from the players themselves It is not enough to succeed with our campaign. That is why we are are also reaching out to the broader Hearthstone community and I think we prepared really nice rewards for all of our backers. If you can't or just don't want to contribute to our campaign with money, but you still like the project, sharing it on your social media or showing it to your friends would go a long way as well :).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What will the money go towards?</h3>
<p>So since $60 000 for a $20 000 tournament might seem like a huge difference. You might be asking where is the rest of the campaign money going to? The money will go towards casting talent, production team salaries, some production tech that will need to be bought/borrowed, renting the villa, towards the rewards that you get for contributing to the campaign and as already mentioned towards paying the travels and accommodations of the qualified players. Around 10% of the campaign will be also eaten by the Indiegogo cut and processing payment fees.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why are we crowdfunding the tournament?</h3>
<p>Our main plan was to get the funds for the tournament from commercial brands that we would advertise during the tournament. Problem is that since we are a new startup with no tournaments of this scale done by us, these brands rather choose different companies with results behind them. This, of course, makes sense, but it is quite unfortunate for us. This is also the main reason why is this first tournament so important to us. </p>
<p>If you decide to help us fund this endeavor, you will be also indirectly helping us fund more Hearthstone tournaments(which are unfortunately on decline at the moment) in the future, since we will finally have data we need to show to our potential partners in the future and that would mean more HS tournaments in general for you to watch. </p>
<h3>What happens to your money if we don't reach the goal?</h3>
<p>This campaign has a fixed goal plan. Which means that all of our backers will get their money back if the goal of the campaign is not met. We are here to make this great project reality and not to take anybody's money from them if it fails. I hope you will join us! :)</p>

<p>My name is Dean Ashford, an Unreal Engine 4 YouTube content creator. For almost two years I have been teaching others how to create video games while working as a freelancer for different indie studios around the UK. Today, I’d like to introduce you to my project, Boxi.</p>
<p>Boxi is a cute and colourful platform game fuelled by a community of gamers and developers. Members of our community tell us what kind of content they want to see in the game, and our team collect these ideas and discuss them to see which ones would gel together in a satisfying way.</p>
<p>Boxi is a creature made of cardboard living in a world of robots. Being the only one of their kind, our hero suffers from an inferiority complex, jealous of how advanced the robots are in comparison.</p>
<p>Boxi sets out on an adventure to upgrade their body so that they can fit in with the other inhabitants of the world. Along the way, Boxi discovers they have access to abilities and powers the robots can’t use. These unique abilities boost Boxi’s confidence and show them realise being different isn’t a bad thing.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>As the player progresses through the game, Boxi will obtain upgrades that will overcome obstacles in upcoming levels and unlock previously unreachable areas in previous zones.</p>
<p>RC Car – Areas too small for Boxi to enter are perfect for the remote-control car. Take control of Boxi’s favourite vehicle and drive around through small tunnels and gaps, who knows what you might find lurking.</p>
<p>Bounce – Boxi can only jump so high, good thing you can throw down a bounce pad to spring yourself higher than usual to get to those hard to reach places.</p>
<p>Grapple – Some areas aren’t safe enough for a Bounce, good thing you found that grapple hook to fly across those extra wide gaps.</p>
<p>Freeze – Boxi can’t go into water! But luckily you can freeze the surface of the wet stuff to cross safely.</p>

<h3>The Game</h3>
<p><i>Strange things are occurring in the galaxy. Multiple planetary systems, seemingly unrelated and far away from each other, have suddenly swirled into chaos. Wars are erupting, space gangs are running amok and communications are lost. Unexplainable phenomena are reported and weird creatures are sighted. What is happening? That's for you to find out, captain!</i></p>
<p>Captain on the Bridge is a multi-genre space adventure, encompassing action, strategy, puzzle-solving and RPG elements. It's a story-driven journey across a randomly-generated galaxy filled with varying sets of handcrafted encounters, locations, quests, characters and enemies. Emphasis is on replayability, as even the main story line will have alterations and provide surprises on different playthroughs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551574029/l0hcmh6qj1eklfsdtio7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Game's plot stretches over several planetary systems, which are small open worlds. You control a starship, with a freedom to explore each system at your own pace, undertake missions, solve quests, gather resources, defeat enemies and meet the inhabitants of the galaxy. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>As a starship captain, you have many tools at your disposal and plenty of things to upgrade and customize:</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555241696/mu9lyz9b12z5bmcwh8yb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ship:</strong> You can alter your ship's layout and build it piece by piece. Install weapons, engines, power generators and many other parts to change the ship's performance and appearance.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fighters:</strong> Your ship can carry multiple small space fighters. You can design them the way you want by placing components in slots. Components work differently in different configurations. You must ensure that energy from power sources is properly routed to the components needing it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Expeditionary force:</strong>  Under your command you have a small military force which can fight enemies on planets. You get to develop more advanced military units and structures and modify them to better suit your needs; for example, you can modify a unit to have more attack but be more expensive to build.</li>
<li>
<strong>Away team:</strong> Away team is a group of close combat specialists who can infiltrate ships and buildings. You can recruit, train and equip team members. There are multiple classes of them, and they gain experience and level ups after missions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Heroes:</strong> Some of the characters you meet may join your crew. These heroes can be used as leaders in battles to gain unique bonus abilities. They can also do special tasks, like use diplomacy to find a peaceful solution to a conflict.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cards: </strong>Disposable quantum cards can be collected and used during battles to combat bad luck by getting an instant one-time bonus.</li>
</ul>
<p>When hostiles are encountered or a mission is started, it's time to fight! <strong>Captain on the Bridge contains four different types of battles:</strong></p>

<p>But the game is not just about fighting. There is also plenty of adventuring to do with decisions to make, inventory-puzzles to solve and characters to talk with (<u><strong>by typing in keywords</strong></u>). Many of the quests have alternative non-violent solutions and you can discover hidden locations, gain unique items and even open secret paths on the main storyline by looking around and using your brain.</p>

<h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Veli-Matti Törmänen, pleased to meet you! I'm a professional programmer, an amateur musician and a wannabe game developer, making games in my free time and operating under the name Hot Byte Games. My first and so far only released creation is a rock band management simulation A Story of a Band, which was released on <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bandgame"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Android (2012)</a>, <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/a-story-of-a-band/id715504749?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iOS (2013) </a>and <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/856450/A_Story_of_a_Band/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PC/Mac (2018)</a>. I've also worked on music &amp; sound design for other developers' projects, for example <a href=""https://virtugo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VirtuGO</a>.</p>
<p>I've been a keen gamer all my life and enjoy creating games because it involves multiple arts close to my heart: drawing,  music and storytelling. Besides games and music, I've made short movies and  <strong>comic strips </strong>(non-professionally).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554282779/ktizlockvmdqlddujlpz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Crowdfunding &amp; How Will The Money Be Used?</h3>
<p>The main objective of this fund-raising is to keep me alive while I complete Captain on the Bridge. I've been working on this game for three years in my spare time, and would now like to start developing it full-time. If this campaign is successful, it will allow me to focus 100% on this game, have it be completed faster, and use all my energy, time and creativity to make it as good as I possibly can. The raised money (after deducting taxes) will go to paying for food, rent and other necessities needed to keep my health bar full. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555236827/qupf8pvdo8wldt3aycyo.png"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555236827/qupf8pvdo8wldt3aycyo.png"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555236827/qupf8pvdo8wldt3aycyo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The secondary objective, if this campaign is popular enough, is to let me hire some help with the game's assets. Ideally, I would like to recruit three people: one to aid me with graphics, another one to create some of the music and sound effects, and a third one to proofread all texts and write some side quests. All of this is optional and not obligatory in order to finish the project, but any extra help would allow me to expand the game, add more content to it and make it overall more polished. I can hire at least one person for a couple of months if the campaign reaches 20,000€, and every contribution beyond that means more workforce.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Current Progress</strong></h3>
<p>The game engine and game mechanics are pretty much complete. All battle types are fully playable and stable. Most of the sound effects and music are missing. Majority of the story missions and quests are yet incomplete. Also much more content in general, like side quests, heroes, enemies, weapons etc. needs to be added, and they all require<strong> new graphic assets drawn</strong>, which is perhaps the single most time-consuming work left. Estimated release is in August 2020.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555352401/kfovlbtcwpovndcbbnbk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Bonus Goals</strong></h3>
<p>Below are some extra features I would like to add to the game, but had to put on hold because of lack of time and resources. They will be implemented if the project gets enough support so that I can hire some helping hands.</p>
<p><strong>20,000€ - Flight Crew: </strong>In addition to heroes, there will be various other classes of crew members to recruit, like navigators, medical officers and engineers. Their skills will range from boosting the ship's weapons to healing injured away team members after a mission.</p>
<p><strong>30,000€ - Minigames:</strong> Three minigames will be added: a hacking themed puzzle game, a resource mining game and a nuclear war themed arcade game within a game that can be played against various characters in the galaxy.</p>
<p><strong>40,000€ - Ship interior: </strong>Player will be able to walk inside their starship among the crew members. The rooms and spaces therein can be upgraded and decorated. The hangar bay, for example, can be modified to hold more fighters. This section will use the same top-down view as the close combat section.</p>
<p><strong>50,000€ - Explorable planets:</strong> You will be able to send an away team down to some planet surfaces to explore, gather resources, fight alien flora and fauna and to search for treasures.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>This might seem like too big of a project for one person to handle. However, majority of the work has been done, and really th<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">e only thing that would prevent me from finishing this game is if something unexpected happens to me. The most realistic risk is that I'm unable to deliver the complete version of the game within the estimated time. If that happens, there's a possibility of releasing the game first as an early access title and then adding the missing content as updates.</span></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Don't Keep It a Secret!</h3>
<p>If you got interested in Captain on the Bridge, please spread the word and let more people know about it!

</div></div>","The Game
Strange things are occurring in the galaxy. Multiple planetary systems, seemingly unrelated and far away from each other, have suddenly swirled into chaos. Wars are erupting, space gangs are running amok and communications are lost. Unexplainable phenomena are reported and weird creatures are sighted. What is happening? That's for you to find out, captain!
Captain on the Bridge is a multi-genre space adventure, encompassing action, strategy, puzzle-solving and RPG elements. It's a story-driven journey across a randomly-generated galaxy filled with varying sets of handcrafted encounters, locations, quests, characters and enemies. Emphasis is on replayability, as even the main story line will have alterations and provide surprises on different playthroughs.

Game's plot stretches over several planetary systems, which are small open worlds. You control a starship, with a freedom to explore each system at your own pace, undertake missions, solve quests, gather resources, defeat enemies and meet the inhabitants of the galaxy. 
As a starship captain, you have many tools at your disposal and plenty of things to upgrade and customize:



Ship: You can alter your ship's layout and build it piece by piece. Install weapons, engines, power generators and many other parts to change the ship's performance and appearance.

Fighters: Your ship can carry multiple small space fighters. You can design them the way you want by placing components in slots. Components work differently in different configurations. You must ensure that energy from power sources is properly routed to the components needing it.

Expeditionary force:  Under your command you have a small military force which can fight enemies on planets. You get to develop more advanced military units and structures and modify them to better suit your needs; for example, you can modify a unit to have more attack but be more expensive to build.

Away team: Away team is a group of close combat specialists who can infiltrate ships and buildings. You can recruit, train and equip team members. There are multiple classes of them, and they gain experience and level ups after missions.

Heroes: Some of the characters you meet may join your crew. These heroes can be used as leaders in battles to gain unique bonus abilities. They can also do special tasks, like use diplomacy to find a peaceful solution to a conflict.

Cards: Disposable quantum cards can be collected and used during battles to combat bad luck by getting an instant one-time bonus.

When hostiles are encountered or a mission is started, it's time to fight! Captain on the Bridge contains four different types of battles:

Real-time battles between big spaceships

Turn-based tactical combat between small space fighters

Real-time close combat shooting with an away team

​Turn-based strategic ground battles on planets
Each of these battle types features completely different game mechanics. Please watch the campaign video for more details on them.
But the game is not just about fighting. There is also plenty of adventuring to do with decisions to make, inventory-puzzles to solve and characters to talk with (by typing in keywords). Many of the quests have alternative non-violent solutions and you can discover hidden locations, gain unique items and even open secret paths on the main storyline by looking around and using your brain.
Here's an example of a simple quest with multiple possible solutions:


 
In addition to story-related content, there are side quests and other optional activities, which are randomly selected for each adventure. The heroes, ship components and other resources you find and have to survive with are also different on each playthrough.


 
About Me
My name is Veli-Matti Törmänen, pleased to meet you! I'm a professional programmer, an amateur musician and a wannabe game developer, making games in my free time and operating under the name Hot Byte Games. My first and so far only released creation is a rock band management simulation A Story of a Band, which was released on Android (2012), iOS (2013) and PC/Mac (2018). I've also worked on music & sound design for other developers' projects, for example VirtuGO.
I've been a keen gamer all my life and enjoy creating games because it involves multiple arts close to my heart: drawing,  music and storytelling. Besides games and music, I've made short movies and  comic strips (non-professionally).

 
Why Crowdfunding & How Will The Money Be Used?
The main objective of this fund-raising is to keep me alive while I complete Captain on the Bridge. I've been working on this game for three years in my spare time, and would now like to start developing it full-time. If this campaign is successful, it will allow me to focus 100% on this game, have it be completed faster, and use all my energy, time and creativity to make it as good as I possibly can. The raised money (after deducting taxes) will go to paying for food, rent and other necessities needed to keep my health bar full.   
The secondary objective, if this campaign is popular enough, is to let me hire some help with the game's assets. Ideally, I would like to recruit three people: one to aid me with graphics, another one to create some of the music and sound effects, and a third one to proofread all texts and write some side quests. All of this is optional and not obligatory in order to finish the project, but any extra help would allow me to expand the game, add more content to it and make it overall more polished. I can hire at least one person for a couple of months if the campaign reaches 20,000€, and every contribution beyond that means more workforce.
 
Current Progress
The game engine and game mechanics are pretty much complete. All battle types are fully playable and stable. Most of the sound effects and music are missing. Majority of the story missions and quests are yet incomplete. Also much more content in general, like side quests, heroes, enemies, weapons etc. needs to be added, and they all require new graphic assets drawn, which is perhaps the single most time-consuming work left. Estimated release is in August 2020.

 
Bonus Goals
Below are some extra features I would like to add to the game, but had to put on hold because of lack of time and resources. They will be implemented if the project gets enough support so that I can hire some helping hands.
20,000€ - Flight Crew: In addition to heroes, there will be various other classes of crew members to recruit, like navigators, medical officers and engineers. Their skills will range from boosting the ship's weapons to healing injured away team members after a mission.
30,000€ - Minigames: Three minigames will be added: a hacking themed puzzle game, a resource mining game and a nuclear war themed arcade game within a game that can be played against various characters in the galaxy.
40,000€ - Ship interior: Player will be able to walk inside their starship among the crew members. The rooms and spaces therein can be upgraded and decorated. The hangar bay, for example, can be modified to hold more fighters. This section will use the same top-down view as the close combat section.
50,000€ - Explorable planets: You will be able to send an away team down to some planet surfaces to explore, gather resources, fight alien flora and fauna and to search for treasures.
 

Risks
This might seem like too big of a project for one person to handle. However, majority of the work has been done, and really the only thing that would prevent me from finishing this game is if something unexpected happens to me. The most realistic risk is that I'm unable to deliver the complete version of the game within the estimated time. If that happens, there's a possibility of releasing the game first as an early access title and then adding the missing content as updates.
 

Don't Keep It a Secret!
If you got interested in Captain on the Bridge, please spread the word and let more people know about it! Raising awareness for a game is vital, but also very difficult to do as a small indie developer. Even if you're unable to fund this time, you can help a great deal by sharing this page or the campaign video with your friends, web community, favorite streamers, youtubers and anyone you think might be interested.
This project is very important to me, and I want to thank you for taking the time to read this pitch. See you on the bridge, captain!",12.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p><i>GrumpyMunkyGameDesign</i> is a One-Man Sole Trader making games in my spare time.</p>
<p>Originally I wanted to be a Fast-Jet Pilot in the RAF but after my Mom had multiple strokes I had to resign myself to being a live-in full time carer. But during that time, I taught myself programming, game design and experimented with several engines from consumer level 'off the shelf' offerings such as FPSCreator and DarkBasic, up to eventually getting involved with Unreal Engine 4 and beginning Work on <i>Minimum Wage</i>.</p>
<p>I Spent almost 2 years working on the game before my Mom eventually passed away, and it sat stagnant for over a year just gathering dust as I dealt with the grief and my personal life falling apart, now thanks to much support from friends and loved ones I'm back in the saddle and after much encouragement from said friends and loved ones finally believe in myself enough to bring my project to the public.</p>
<p>After spending so long as a carer and being left with so much debt after my Mom passing, I dont have the funds to seek publishing on marketplaces like Steam or Gog.com, or pay for any advertising. We had the game on itch.io for a while but without the funds to purchase Ad's or otherwise drive traffic to the page it simply languished as it waited for people to stumble across it.</p>
<p>Your funding and support will go towards paying the fees to get the game listed on places such as Steam and towards securing Advertising, Marketing and Social Media prescence to drive potential customers towards the page and otherwise make people aware that the game even exists.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We aren't looking for a huge amount of funding, just enough to cover the Steam fees and other aggregator site fees or advertising to get the game in front of<strong> potential players </strong>and make them aware of its existence, what it is and why they might like to play it.</p>
<p>The game is currently in extreme <strong>early access</strong>, but is completely playable from start to finish (With the content we currently have tested and functional) so everyone who backs at the appropriate tiers won't have to wait to play it, the Early Access build will be made available at the end of the campaign with download codes being sent out to all backers who pledge at those levels.</p>
<p><strong>Other perks</strong> are included such as credits, your own personal spaces in some of the levels (for example there are several unoccupied desks in the Office Level, that can be customized and made your own for you own unique stamp on the actual game itself, at the appropriate tier.)</p>
<p>If we fail to meet the goal, we will still endeavour to do <strong>as much as possible </strong>with the funds provided. If we cannot afford the Steam fees still, we will direct the money into driving traffic towards the Itch.io listing, but if we can at least get enough to pay the Steam fees, then any additional funding will go towards driving traffic to the Steam pages, securing content providers to play and stream the game and any other marketing avenues we can possibly use to get word out about the game.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact you support will have</h3>
<p>Without your help and support this project is stuck in limbo, with all the personal issues, both financial and mental we have endured over the last 12 months or so, there's almost no way we can afford to pay the Steam registration fees or put money aside for advertising. So without you, there is <strong>NO</strong> <i>Minimum Wage</i>, you are that important to the success or failure of this game and we understand that as first timer's when it comes to IndieGoGo and Crowdfunding, we are going to have to go the <strong>extra mile</strong> to build that important trust between backer and campaigner.</p>
<p>We aren't trying to pull a fast one, or defraud anyone, thats why <strong>we ask for so little</strong>. We believe the game can stand on its own two feet and attract an audience, if only we can get it in front of that audience and secure some advertising to bring the game to the attention of people who may wish to play it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges facing us</h3>
<p>As <strong>first time campaigners</strong> we understand we are venturing into unknown territory, we have never ran a successful crowdfunding campaign nor had to handle any financial commitments that weren't solely our own.</p>
<p>But we are quick to learn and with your <strong>support and guidance</strong> we are certain we can overcome any hurdles or challenges that might befall us, I have almost <strong>10 years experience</strong> in game design and have put out free games that have been streamed/played by youtubers and streamers, so we feel confident in the game itself, but simply lack the start up capital to get it in front of the right people and thats where you come in!</p>
<p>We have a distribution method in place to get download codes to backers to fulfill our pledges and have been in touch with Steam and places like Gog.com and Humble bundle, we just lack the funds for the upfront costs assosciated with registration and marketing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cant help out financially in these times, with Covid-19 running rampant its no surprise.</p>
<p>But please, Share this project with friends, facebook groups, twitter, youtube etc and help get the word out and maybe some of the folks you send here can contribute where you may not be able to.</p>

Work in progress.
   

You tell me, is learning how to say torpedo in German, while having a double rainbow across the sky on your phone and listening to a Mariachi jamming fun for you?
If not, then I guess this game is not for you.

I'm a Venezuelan college student who just turned 18 (that basically means I'm broke beyond belief and finding developing partners in my country is extremely difficult), which is why this game would be fed with your contributions and grow to its full potential.





But don't worry, you would only be helping this dream become a reality, not helping me become a slob.

<p><b>""<a href=""http://catchkrishna.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Catch Krishna in Vrindavan</a>"" is the very first bhakti board game</b>, in which main characters are divine personalities of Hindu mythology: Radha, Krishna and the gopis. Most of you might wonder how come that the idea of such an unusual game 
came to our minds. As behind every product made with Love there is 
always a story, there is also a story behind the “<strong>Catch Krishna in Vrindavan</strong>” game. How has it started? Read on our blog: <a href=""http://catchkrishna.com/how-it-started"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://catchkrishna.com/how-it-started</a></p>
<p><b>""Catch</b> <strong>Krishna in Vrindavan” is a unique board game</strong> that 
will take you into the magical world of Vrindavan letting you 
participate in one of the most thrilling ancient spiritual love stories 
the world has ever known: the story about Krishna and the gopis. Like the gopis were always looking for their beloved Krishna in many 
places of Vrindavan, so you will now walk with your “gopi pawn” on the 
map, along with other players, trying to find and catch Krishna. You 
will discover many magical sacred places and temples on your way. But do
 not forget the goal! You have <strong>only 27 rounds</strong> to catch Krishna.

Get to know another <b>addition to the game</b> created especially for the upcoming Diwali! We are not wasting time! This special addition contains the instructions to <b>3 completely new games</b> to be played on the ""Catch Krishna in Vrindavan"" board along with 120 additional colorful wooden coins representing the Diwali lamps and 16 cards with specific tasks for each player. In the beginning of one of these 3 games each player receives a card with their task and tries their best to complete the task - before the other players complete theirs. No player knows the tasks of the other players, so it requires a great deal of strategic thinking. Light up the whole map of Vrindavan during <b>this Diwali</b>! But remember to complete your task before the others do theirs. The player who completes his task first becomes the winner of the game.

<h2><u>Hello, I'm Thato Mogale</u></h2>
<p>I am a 20-year-old self-taught game developer from Ga-Kgapane, Limpopo, South Africa. I love making video games as much as I love playing them. I am a big Chelsea F.C. fan and I love Marvel films. I grew up in and out of poverty, but I've always made the most out of it. I have been a solo independent developer for nearly 2 years now and despite the lack of resources, I have spent hours upon hours in that time, sharpening my skills and abilities, until I've become an expert. And looking back, what a journey it has been, from playing with a brick as a toy car to making video games. </p>

<h2><u>Where will the money go?</u></h2>
<p>The money will count as capital, and will go towards:</p>
<p>- Building a team. I currently do everything myself (you name it, I do it) and that's too much for one man. So I need skilled individuals that can help me with game design, art, programming, audio (sound effects and music), animation etc.</p>
<p>- Adding more features (levels, powerups etc) and improving gameplay</p>
<p>- User Acquisition. This is when a video game is promoted and advertised to gain more users, which in turn will generate more revenue.</p>
<p>- The money will also lay a strong foundation for sequels and future games</p>
<p>Having studied accounting, business studies, and economics in high school and university (at Wits University, which is the top business university in Africa) for 4 years prior to getting into game development, I am well-equipped even on the financial side.</p>
<h2><u>How much of an impact will your money have?</u></h2>
<p>A lot. It will improve the game itself ie. the art, gameplay, audio (music and sound effects), physics, graphics, graphics, the list goes on. This is a game that could potentially be the next Crossy Road, Flappy Bird or dare I say, Minecraft success story. And if you're looking at the bigger picture, your contribution will mean even more than that. There are not a lot of African game developers out there, and I am hoping that the success of this game will inspire young people to get involved in the video game industry, and overall, the tech industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><u>What is the ultimate goal?</u></h2>
<p>And even if the target goal is not reached, the money will still be spent on improving the game. I will still continue to pour my heart and soul into this project and improve the game in whatever way I can with the resources I have. Hopefully, I can one day scrape together some money to move to Silicon Valley in California (where there are more opportunities for tech companies).</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I want to make a high-quality game for everyone to enjoy and it would be my greatest ever achievement to fulfil this.</p>

I am a 20-year-old self-taught game developer from Ga-Kgapane, Limpopo, South Africa. I love making video games as much as I love playing them. I am a big Chelsea F.C. fan and I love Marvel films. I grew up in and out of poverty, but I've always made the most out of it. I have been a solo independent developer for nearly 2 years now and despite the lack of resources, I have spent hours upon hours in that time, sharpening my skills and abilities, until I've become an expert. And looking back, what a journey it has been, from playing with a brick as a toy car to making video games. 
 
What's this game about?

Smack A Thief is a 3D, tower defence, action mobile game where the objective is simple, stop house robbers from stealing your stuff by smacking them! The game gets progressively more difficult as you go, and there are 4 powerups to aid you along the way.

<p>My name's Tuomo Laine, who's currently studying at Vocational Institute. I've been making video games for nearly 20 years. Bride for the Princess is my second Visual Novel.</p>

<p>- We believe at Endlessrunninggames that our debut game Catch The Bull will be a huge hit. I don't just say this because I'm biased, no we have stats to back up our claims. We started a promotional campaign on Facebook to get the feel of peoples reaction to our game. So we set a one month campaign and we got almost 55,000 followers for our page and about one thousand emails about the release of the game.</p>
<p>* Check out our facebook page: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Endless-Running-Games-979309262206130/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/Endless-Running-Games-...</a></p>
<p>- Some risks and challenges are that we have to compete with other runner games like subway surfer and bus rush. I believe we have the upper hand because we've implemented a unique style of game-play that other runner games don't have which is catching and balancing bulls while running and chasing bulls with our amazing car power-up.</p>
<p>* We have also started to integrate multiple new environments other from the ones you've seen in our video at the top of our page. We've added a beach environment that looks stunning and can also be improved by your dear contributions. We've also added a night cycle along with the day and it will also be improved. The paths will also be widened as there were some complaints on the width of the paths. We take all your criticisms and try to better ourselves. Look at the picture below:</p>

<p>- If your unable to contribute we understand and we would kindly like to ask you if you wouldn't mind to make some noise about our game with your friends and family. </p>

</div></div>","Have a look at our website for more information. Link below. Keep in mind we are a new company with a unique look in the gaming industry and with your help in contributions we can spearhead our game to heights only dreamt of. 
Website: https://endlessrunninggames.com/
We at Endlessrunninggames take our work very passionately. We aim to deliver the best games possible for people to enjoy and we also aim to be one of the best companies in mobile games. We are a young company but are driven to create the best possible projects. We are a team of six people which include:

1 Owner & CEO
3 Developers
1 graphic designer
1 Marketing Specialist

 Our campaign is to basically raise funds to better our game in every possible aspect. which are:

Increase the quality of graphics
Graphics will be optimized through characters, environments, starter packs and the whole look of the game in general.
Additional themes
Adding a angry ghost bull as a starter ( find out by downloading the game ;) . 
Additional character and starter packs
Multiplayer feature that will allow you to compete with other players and friends live to see who's the best bull catcher
Chat Features 
Have a better focus on bugs and try to maintain them throughout pre and post production to better the players experience.
Try to add more employees to the team to help increase experience in the staff and efficiency in the game.

* Your contributions will not only help us in producing catch the bull, it will be the foundation for our future in the gaming industry. Without you we would complete our project in a year or two but with your help we will complete our project in 2 to 3 months at most. As the only thing we lack is your support and hopefully we can get it. Please help to bringing this unique game to life.


- Our funding goal is 30,000 dollars. This money will be going to:

Better game engines to increase the quality in graphics all throughout the game
Add more staff to help with the production and bugs and graphic designing.
Marketing will be a major factor as we have to market for the world as we will be targeting country by country and our aim is to reach the top of the charts to gain more recognition. 


- We will be offering 5 perks:

Bull Admirer: Thanks for your support! Every bit counts and you made us take a step closer to our goal. You will not be forgotten
Bull Catcher: 100,000 in game coins
Bull Master: 250,000 in game coins and 1 merchandise item. 
Bull Legend: 500,000 in game coins and 2 merchandise items plus 1 surprise merchandise package.
Bull Tamer: 1,000,000 in game coins and 3 merchandise items, 2 surprise packages with new free updated characters and starter packs.

* If we don't reach our goal the funds will still be put to good use. We have ranked our objectives from most to least important. If we don't get our complete funding we will get the most important objectives done first and then worry about the others.
* Your kind hearted contributions will make a huge difference like you cant believe, You'll make a great game come to reality and putting smiles and enjoyment on peoples faces.

- We believe at Endlessrunninggames that our debut game Catch The Bull will be a huge hit. I don't just say this because I'm biased, no we have stats to back up our claims. We started a promotional campaign on Facebook to get the feel of peoples reaction to our game. So we set a one month campaign and we got almost 55,000 followers for our page and about one thousand emails about the release of the game.
* Check out our facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/Endless-Running-Games-...
- Some risks and challenges are that we have to compete with other runner games like subway surfer and bus rush. I believe we have the upper hand because we've implemented a unique style of game-play that other runner games don't have which is catching and balancing bulls while running and chasing bulls with our amazing car power-up.
* We have also started to integrate multiple new environments other from the ones you've seen in our video at the top of our page. We've added a beach environment that looks stunning and can also be improved by your dear contributions. We've also added a night cycle along with the day and it will also be improved. The paths will also be widened as there were some complaints on the width of the paths. We take all your criticisms and try to better ourselves. Look at the picture below:

- If your unable to contribute we understand and we would kindly like to ask you if you wouldn't mind to make some noise about our game with your friends and family. 
- Also don't forget to use the indiegogo share tools to raise awarness about the next best runner game to hit the market: Catch The Bull.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>One of the key features of TAIKER's gameplay is the <b>Combo Attack</b> system. Different characters may have different movesets, so let's take your initial character Peggy for example. </p>
<p>The basic combo is quadruple slash attacks by pressing ""attack"" four times. The last one knocks the enemy back. And on the third hit, if you press ""skill"" instead, she will release a crescent-shaped shockwave to end the combo. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/pic2Gz2.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You can do different combos depending on what skills you've learned and chosen. When your character is in air, there's also a variant combo with different ending skills. So there's a lot of options in battle!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/jOBtmhz.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Along with combo attacks, two other key systems for combat are the <b>Enemy Marking</b> and <b>Trait System</b>.</p>
<p>Enemy marking allows you to lock on enemies and activate special moves, such as sliding toward the target, while trait system provides a learning tree to unlock different skills and abilities to choose from for combo attacks!</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The game is currently under development by a two-man team, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/garfgary"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gary Lin</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/klein1008"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yu Chia Ming</a>, in <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/5LPtNNMDgTE2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Taiwan</a>. We really loved platformer games like Castlevania, Mega Man, and Metroid. We've been always hoping to merge a gorgeous combat system into this genre, and TAIKER is the result!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">TAIKER is our first game, but we have been working in the video game industry as programmer and artist for over a decade. We made up our mind to build our own games as an indie game studio because we want to create a game that we will really love and be proud of, a game in honor of the old-school gaming experience we all had during our young age.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you haven't played our demo yet, I recommend you pause reading and give it a try! The game is still away from perfection, and we need financial support to achieve that. We don't want to rely on publishers, so we take this crowdfunding campaign as a great opportunity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457171779/xjr8jzsye5zsnitufvs6.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our plan</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One crucial part missing in the game now is the music. If we meet our goal successfully, we will be able to <b>collaborate with the best composers to create great audio works for the game</b>. We place a high value on music because it would be the key to enhance the depth of atmosphere in the world of TAIKER.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">And to bring the game to our players as soon as possible, we do want to <b>expand the team by recruiting 2-3 staff members</b>. We have had a few candidates, they are all talented artists and designers and will be a great help to us.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The game is only in English and Chinese for now, yet we've planned to <b>release the game in more languages</b>, for instance French, Spanish, and Russian. But please understand that it would have to depend on how well the campaign goes, so it's not promised.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Last but not the least, <b>if we're able to reach the stretch goals, there will be more playable characters in the game</b>! The proposal of stretch goals would come after we met the standard 45,000 goal. Help us get through it!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The game is scheduled to be finished in <b>6-8 months</b> and be released on <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steam</a> in <b>late 2016</b>. Though the road ahead is so long that we can only estimate it.</p>

Story

Landscapes/Characters

A drowned city left over from the old world. It was abandoned after the cataclysm.

Underground world. Could there be any buried secret?

Aircraft from the old world.
 Female and male protectors. Only the very few talented people can be trained to become a protector. They help maintain civilization and keep order among society.
Gameplay


One of the key features of TAIKER's gameplay is the Combo Attack system. Different characters may have different movesets, so let's take your initial character Peggy for example. 
The basic combo is quadruple slash attacks by pressing ""attack"" four times. The last one knocks the enemy back. And on the third hit, if you press ""skill"" instead, she will release a crescent-shaped shockwave to end the combo. 

You can do different combos depending on what skills you've learned and chosen. When your character is in air, there's also a variant combo with different ending skills. So there's a lot of options in battle!

Along with combo attacks, two other key systems for combat are the Enemy Marking and Trait System.
Enemy marking allows you to lock on enemies and activate special moves, such as sliding toward the target, while trait system provides a learning tree to unlock different skills and abilities to choose from for combo attacks!




The game is currently under development by a two-man team, Gary Lin and Yu Chia Ming, in Taiwan. We really loved platformer games like Castlevania, Mega Man, and Metroid. We've been always hoping to merge a gorgeous combat system into this genre, and TAIKER is the result!
TAIKER is our first game, but we have been working in the video game industry as programmer and artist for over a decade. We made up our mind to build our own games as an indie game studio because we want to create a game that we will really love and be proud of, a game in honor of the old-school gaming experience we all had during our young age.
If you haven't played our demo yet, I recommend you pause reading and give it a try! The game is still away from perfection, and we need financial support to achieve that. We don't want to rely on publishers, so we take this crowdfunding campaign as a great opportunity.

Our plan
One crucial part missing in the game now is the music. If we meet our goal successfully, we will be able to collaborate with the best composers to create great audio works for the game. We place a high value on music because it would be the key to enhance the depth of atmosphere in the world of TAIKER.
And to bring the game to our players as soon as possible, we do want to expand the team by recruiting 2-3 staff members. We have had a few candidates, they are all talented artists and designers and will be a great help to us.
The game is only in English and Chinese for now, yet we've planned to release the game in more languages, for instance French, Spanish, and Russian. But please understand that it would have to depend on how well the campaign goes, so it's not promised.
Last but not the least, if we're able to reach the stretch goals, there will be more playable characters in the game! The proposal of stretch goals would come after we met the standard 45,000 goal. Help us get through it!
The game is scheduled to be finished in 6-8 months and be released on Steam in late 2016. Though the road ahead is so long that we can only estimate it.

<b>Endohumans</b> will be an original revolutionary App that will marry 
these two concepts so we get a captivating adventurous storyline which, 
in order to proceed in, the user 
will need to get his feet on the ground and start working out!<br/>
<b><br/>THE STORY</b><br/><br/>So imagine you've just downloaded a new seemingly common smartphone fitness application  which like many others tracks your steps/runs/cycle rides and other workout info with the normal maps and musical playback... however this time something extraordinary happens!<br/><br/>
<p>This is not like any normal application! Soon you discover that your application has been ""intercepted"" and you are being communicated by the ""Endohuman Defense Network"" (EDN), a ""supposedly"" top secret global agency which is responsible for defending mankind against an unknown enemy. <br/></p>
<p>Do you have what it takes to join the Network? </p>
<p>The only way to find out is to carry out the training and missions assigned to you by the EDN as they ""intercept"" your fitness app while you are ACTUALLY and PHYSICALLY working out and give you instructions on how to complete the mission!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While you become a secret member of the EDN,
you will need to earn Enduras. Enduras are the Network's  recognition and power points. <br/></p>
<p>You will also access via a ""top-secret"" uplink a mysterious computer which will guide you  on online quests to solve puzzles through the use of the internet and your wits in order to uncover
the greatest conspiracy mankind has ever known and saving the world!</p>

<p><b>GAMEPLAY</b></p>
<p>In order to progress in the game and unfold the exciting and mysterious storyline you will need to earn promotion through the Endohuman Network by generating Enduras.</p>
<p>Enduras are needed to unlock newer missions, newer quests and progress the storyline.<br/></p>
<p>They can be generated by:<br/></p>
<p>a)<span>  </span><i>Physically completing Training
Missions in the App</i></p>
<p>When you start playing you will be asked to perform training missions in order to graduate the Endohuman Academy and acquire the necessary skills to join the Network and help save mankind! Enduras are granted while you are working out (with your smartphone) based on distance, time, pace, breaking personal records, number of workouts per week etc. Even after you graduate you will be able to perform training missions to earn more Enduras and achieve further promotion.<i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>b)  Physically completing EDN Missions
in the App </i></p>
<p>After you graduate, depending on your level and Enduras, you will be called upon to  carry certain EDN Missions where ""The
Carpenter"" and other in-game characters will ""communicate"" with you in the app and
give you your missions which will include walking/running, beating a certain
time, delivering an encrypted message, solving a quest, escaping
pursuit etc).

</p>
<i>c)<span>  </span>Importing workout  data
from outside the App<br/><br/></i><p>You also generate enduras by importing workout and other data from other Fitness Apps and hardware (e.g. importing from Apple Watch, Apple Health, Google Fit)

. These will then be translated to Enduras based on the Endohuman ""ancient secret"" algorithm,  therefore you can continue to use other apps to train which will be consolidated into the game through this function. Endohumans will also export workout data performed in our app to selected third party applications (e.g. Apple Health) <i><br/></i></p>
<p>d)<span>  </span><i>Solving quests </i></p>
<p>It's not just about working out! You will also need to train your mind and soul as you are communicated by a mysterious computer (depending on your level and enduras) which guides you as you carry out very interesting internet scavenger hunts and provide the correct answer in order to earn more Enduras and progress the storyline!<br/></p>
<p><i>e)<span>  </span>Other methods</i> <br/></p>
<p>You can also earn Enduras through other methods like interacting in the Endohuman Network
(website forum), referring friends etc</p>


Phew! <br/><br/>That was a lot of talking so here is a graphical representation of how Enduras are generated in the game!

<b>HOW WE WILL USE THE RAISED FUNDS</b><br/>
<p>
</p>
<p>Despite some thoughts and offers to
sell our idea and work-in-progress, we have decided to stay loyal to our vision. <br/></p>
<p>We therefore plan to personally oversee the delivery of the Endohuman project, in collaboration with
our app development partners as well as with your help (as funders), so as to not
compromise the game and storyline development in any way. </p>
<p>The idea and storyline is
all set out, and we have already started developing the first version of the app (Chapter I - Earth). We will also use the funding to upgrade the necessary IT
infrastructure (website, servers etc) and set up a marketing campaign while if we exceed our target we will invest in enhancing the existing features and including professional video interludes/animation and hiring professional voice actors!</p>
<p>This is an ""all-or-nothing"" funding campaign so if the amount raised is not at least €25.000 all the campaign funding will be returned to the funders by Indiegogo at the end of the campaign. So there is no risk in investing and the project not going ahead due to lack of funding!</p>
<p>We are a hybrid team comprising of Accounting, Marketing and IT Security experts and require an initial capital inflow to obtain offers from professional smartphone app game developers. <br/></p>The current team is fully committed to the project and will find an excellent professional app development team to cooperate with and bring this to realisation.<br/><br/><b>INITIAL FEEDBACK</b><br/>

<p>Trevor Scott is a Jackson Square Artist in New Orleans, LA. He started a company called Ink it comics also Ink_it_comics_Studios. Trevor Scott stared creating characters for a comic book series called Wooley Booger since the age of 8. Wooley Booger is about a rabbit named Reno that becomes a super hero. Reno's overall goal in the story is to find and save his girlfriend. He also must seek out revenge against whoever has kidnapped his girlfriend and is trying to kill him. Reno accomplishes something along the way. During the course of the adventure, he meets other characters that help him become a better version of himself while fighting the mob and freeing his girlfriend. The purpose of Wooley Booger is to show the different facts of human condition that causes people to not live up to their highest potential. Wooley Booger spotlights a deeper understanding of life itself. Reno forms a group of charters to help him along the adventure. Through their interaction with Reno, each character grows into a better version of themselves. The big picture in Wooley Booger is that as Reno's life develops certain characters, while their association with him might come to an end, he won't stop growing.  </p>

You need to plant seeds and sell the fruit to be able to buy better seeds, weapons and pay your taxes.<br/>Oh! Wait! Weapons? YES! They are… like… Uncommon tools for farming...?</p><p>The idea came up during Ludum Dare 41 Game-Jam and we had much positive criticism and lots of support during our live-coding-streams.</p><h2>Game-Description</h2><p>CornWars is a mash-up of classical farming simulation and a shooter-game. We plan to release it on PC but console ports could come in future depending on the success of the game. Basically you will play as a farmer on your very own small world. You will start with a small barn and one field. Get a few seeds at the local farmer store and grow your first plants, harvest them and make some money with their fruit.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528582058/d5kd2d3evcrjq5xppw6v.png"" src=""""/></p><p>These are the plants from LD version (Tech Preview) - The corn (on the right side) is in dead state (originating from diseases)</p><p>You will soon notice that farming ""by hand"" is very slow, hard and non-efficient. So how could you upgrade your business? Get some tools! Usually this would be a hoe, shovel and so on but at CornWars things are different. You need a shotgun to make farmland. Afterwards you can grab a revolver or pistol to shoot seeds into the ground which will makte this action way more efficient. In further game progress you will get even better weapons. Next step would be grabbing a sniper or other more ranged gun. At this point the game will change. You do no longer walk on the field to shoot seeds into the ground but instead get targets at the farm-tiles which you will have to shoot at. They willl then plant seeds in a radius depending on the weapon and a few other factors.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528582084/z5wd3o9cmfd75nnygrwz.png"" src=""""/></p><p>To plant a seed after you prepared the ground you need to aim and shoot a moving target on the farmland tile</p><p>This is the farming-part. Further there will be a multi-functional tank used for e.g. preparing the farmland or shooting bigger ammunition. There will be crafting to put your seeds into bigger ammunition.</p><p>The tank (first sketched model - will of course be refined for the actual game)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528582110/mqvf0vg5uc28izpt05e2.png"" src=""""/></p><p>We will include bombs and grenades for various tasks. You will be able to call a airplane to ""waterbomb"" your fields for better growth... This is just a small insight into the game - we do not want to spoiler too much now :)</p><p>Also our game will feature different negative effects like diseases, robbery and even some opponents like foreign farmers or insects trying to ruin your harvest which will appear occationally. </p><p>To make the game progress clearer and kind of challenging you will get quests to fullfill. If you need more room for planting you can buy more fields or increase your storage to be able to store more fruits. But after all do not forget to pay your taxes as every square meter will cost taxes.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528582241/nsgljz6s5oxhwd3bw8ly.png"" src=""""/></p><p>This is our base idea from LD41 (Unfortunately german) - Till today there is much more planned content.</p><p>At the time of writing this text there are already more than 10 different plants, 16 weapons and 5 negative effects as well as a few other events planned. More ideas are added every few days.</p><p>Furthermore there will be a quest and achievement system to guide and challenge you through the game.</p><h2>Timeline and Plans</h2><p>We are starting over with a clean project (never rely on a jammed code) and are already in development-process. We participated in Ludum Dare 41 Game Jam which is a very well known challenge, happening three times a year (approximately every four months). During this contest we developed ""CornWars LD"" which is a basic implementation of our idea lacking a huge amount of content and showing slightly different mechanics. Also it has some bugs as in the nature of such a contest you are in a hurry and do not have time for structural plans or changes.</p><p>Our target is to get a steam shop page ready until end of may. We hope to be able to start into a first closed alpha round for the main part of the game by November 2018 with our Alpha-Backers (there are limited places available). At this time we will probably still be missing some features like quests and other specials but the whole game mechanic itself should be running. Futhrt we plan to go into full featured (public) Early Access until End of 2018 where full featured means all promised features should be implemented and working, all models and graphics should be ready and we do only need to balance a few things, fix some bugs that may appear and go on with implementing additions.</p><p>If the game has great success and that is a requested feature we want to implement some multiplayer support (Co-op farming) The time of this implementation will depend on a few factors and is in no way tied to any date yet.</p><h2>
<br/>Gameplay-Targets</h2><p>People were asking how we plan to bind the player to the game. Why the player should play the game.</p><p>We already mentioned quests. You will have kind of a story line to play through by quests. Some might return, some won't.</p><p>Completing quests as well as some other circumstances will give you achievements.</p><p>There will be a hand full of leaderboards (like average coin gain per hour played or quest statistics)</p><p>Some quests will be challenges. Those challenges will also be subject for leaderboards.</p><h2>Showcase</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528582295/ibkzygtd4r6zzgzh4x1a.png"" src=""""/></p><p>As mentioned we participated in LD41 and this idea comes from the jam. As such we have implemented a slightly differend and very rudimentary version of the basic game logic. <u><strong><a href=""https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/ld41-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can download and play this for free by clicking here</a></strong></u>. It is kind of a technical preview of our idea. For example the preview does no contain big differences between revolver and sniper. The cooldowns are a bit nasty...</p><p>During development we will occasionally publish news about our progress here as well as do some live streaming sessions where you can ask questions and add your own ideas to improve the game.</p><p> </p><h2>Financial plan</h2><p>The To-Be-Raised funds of this campaign will be used for license cost for our needed software.</p><p>If we get enough support we will get a coworking space to be bale to work toigether even more efficient.</p><p>The target of this campaign is the minimal volume of funds needed for us to afford the game development cost as well as to send the rewards out.</p><p>As you can see we really need some space for working on the project to be able to complete it in a timely and efficient manner.</p><p>Of course we are able and willing to add personal funds if we happen to need some more assets later. Furthermore we get some support over patreon and from our twitch subscribers. This also goes directly into the projects funds.</p><h3>What if we are not able to collect the whole funds?</h3><p>We will need to pay the licenses by our own. Furthermore the big goal is around 5.000 to 6.000€ to be able to get a coworking office space, better sounds etc. 700€ is just the fixed cost we will have in any case.</p><p> </p><h2>Stretch Goals</h2><p>We also got a few stretch goals. Please note that the stretch goal contents mitght be delivered after our official release.</p><p><strong>5.000€</strong> - Together is better!</p><p>We will rent a coworking space where we can work together even more efficient. Probably we can shorten the planned release date?!</p><p><strong>10.000€</strong> - Additional content for full backing</p><p>This is our stretch goal which will ensure we got some extra buffer and can create some extra content and better marketing.</p><p>To thank our backers we will add one fantasy plant which we will plan and design together with our backers. The plant will be a very special and fancy plant with features other plants don't have.</p><p>Furthermore we will try our best to implement a few more other plants and contents which might else come in a DLC.</p><p><strong>12.500€ </strong>- Trading</p><p>If we reach a goal of 12.500€ we will implement a trading post where you can offer goods for coins and other players can buy them. This will also add an additional layer of complexity as we will need to implement a higher demand on different items.</p><p><strong>15.000€</strong> - Co-Op Farming</p><p>If we reach the goal of 15.000€ we will implement a Co-Op Farming mode where you can play together with a friend at the same farm. </p><p><strong>30.000€ </strong>- Online-Realtime-Simulation</p><p>If we happen reach a goal of 30.000€ we are going to additionally implement a Real-Time online mode where other players could visit your farm and would be able to interact with you to for example fight against you, steal goods, or simply help you out. This is a huge addon as we will also implement features for the players to defend themselves.</p><p> </p><h2>Further Support</h2><p>If you want to support our project a bit more or don't want to back us but support us anyways you can share this campaign with your friends and follow us on twitter.</p></div>","IntroductionWelcome to our Project - we are glad you finally landed here.Did you ever try to shoot a bullet into the ground and see what happens?Probably it will grow a big beautiful tree of pistols or bullets or probably it will just be a bunch of wheat plants… Who knows? We do. Welcome to Corn Wars!

Also it has some bugs as in the nature of such a contest you are in a hurry and do not have time for structural plans or changes.Our target is to get a steam shop page ready until end of may. We hope to be able to start into a first closed alpha round for the main part of the game by November 2018 with our Alpha-Backers (there are limited places available). At this time we will probably still be missing some features like quests and other specials but the whole game mechanic itself should be running. Futhrt we plan to go into full featured (public) Early Access until End of 2018 where full featured means all promised features should be implemented and working, all models and graphics should be ready and we do only need to balance a few things, fix some bugs that may appear and go on with implementing additions.If the game has great success and that is a requested feature we want to implement some multiplayer support (Co-op farming) The time of this implementation will depend on a few factors and is in no way tied to any date yet.
Gameplay-TargetsPeople were asking how we plan to bind the player to the game. Why the player should play the game.We already mentioned quests. You will have kind of a story line to play through by quests. Some might return, some won't.Completing quests as well as some other circumstances will give you achievements.There will be a hand full of leaderboards (like average coin gain per hour played or quest statistics)Some quests will be challenges. Those challenges will also be subject for leaderboards.ShowcaseAs mentioned we participated in LD41 and this idea comes from the jam. As such we have implemented a slightly differend and very rudimentary version of the basic game logic. You can download and play this for free by clicking here. It is kind of a technical preview of our idea. For example the preview does no contain big differences between revolver and sniper. The cooldowns are a bit nasty...During development we will occasionally publish news about our progress here as well as do some live streaming sessions where you can ask questions and add your own ideas to improve the game. Financial planThe To-Be-Raised funds of this campaign will be used for license cost for our needed software.If we get enough support we will get a coworking space to be bale to work toigether even more efficient.The target of this campaign is the minimal volume of funds needed for us to afford the game development cost as well as to send the rewards out.As you can see we really need some space for working on the project to be able to complete it in a timely and efficient manner.Of course we are able and willing to add personal funds if we happen to need some more assets later. Furthermore we get some support over patreon and from our twitch subscribers. This also goes directly into the projects funds.What if we are not able to collect the whole funds?We will need to pay the licenses by our own. Furthermore the big goal is around 5.000 to 6.000€ to be able to get a coworking office space, better sounds etc. 700€ is just the fixed cost we will have in any case. Stretch GoalsWe also got a few stretch goals. Please note that the stretch goal contents mitght be delivered after our official release.5.000€ - Together is better!We will rent a coworking space where we can work together even more efficient. Probably we can shorten the planned release date?!10.000€ - Additional content for full backingThis is our stretch goal which will ensure we got some extra buffer and can create some extra content and better marketing.To thank our backers we will add one fantasy plant which we will plan and design together with our backers. The plant will be a very special and fancy plant with features other plants don't have.Furthermore we will try our best to implement a few more other plants and contents which might else come in a DLC.12.500€ - TradingIf we reach a goal of 12.500€ we will implement a trading post where you can offer goods for coins and other players can buy them. This will also add an additional layer of complexity as we will need to implement a higher demand on different items.15.000€ - Co-Op FarmingIf we reach the goal of 15.000€ we will implement a Co-Op Farming mode where you can play together with a friend at the same farm. 30.000€ - Online-Realtime-SimulationIf we happen reach a goal of 30.000€ we are going to additionally implement a Real-Time online mode where other players could visit your farm and would be able to interact with you to for example fight against you, steal goods, or simply help you out. This is a huge addon as we will also implement features for the players to defend themselves. Further SupportIf you want to support our project a bit more or don't want to back us but support us anyways you can share this campaign with your friends and follow us on twitter.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Crypto Mining War is not an investment plateform, neither a mining plateform. Crypto Mining War is a game with the purpose of bringing entertainement and fun while learning about Crypto-currencies and Blockchain world.</p>
<p>There's no real risk as game is already in development. Game will be released with or without having reach the main goal of the campain. Anyway, the campain success would considerably accelerate the process! Moreover, the advantage to work with multiple beta version is that we can deliver a playable version of the game soon, even if it's not complete. After that, every day will be a work to improve the game and add the features, thanks to your returns of beta test!</p>
<p>About the Esport tournaments with rewards, there's no participation fees and game is free-to-play. Tournaments reward will depends on the company earnings, like sponsoring, advertising, goodies, etc. The company will make all the verification process to respect the law regarding game with Esport rewards, mainly concerning the real money reward (as crypto-currencies are considered as financial asset). So about this, it might be possible that Crypto-Esport would be prohibited in your country. We advice potential backer to check in their country law to find it out.</p>

Risks & Challenges
Crypto Mining War is not an investment plateform, neither a mining plateform. Crypto Mining War is a game with the purpose of bringing entertainement and fun while learning about Crypto-currencies and Blockchain world.
There's no real risk as game is already in development. Game will be released with or without having reach the main goal of the campain. Anyway, the campain success would considerably accelerate the process! Moreover, the advantage to work with multiple beta version is that we can deliver a playable version of the game soon, even if it's not complete. After that, every day will be a work to improve the game and add the features, thanks to your returns of beta test!
About the Esport tournaments with rewards, there's no participation fees and game is free-to-play. Tournaments reward will depends on the company earnings, like sponsoring, advertising, goodies, etc. The company will make all the verification process to respect the law regarding game with Esport rewards, mainly concerning the real money reward (as crypto-currencies are considered as financial asset). So about this, it might be possible that Crypto-Esport would be prohibited in your country. We advice potential backer to check in their country law to find it out.

<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">We are friends since high school. We nurtured our dreams while play games and reading comic books together. We went to separate colleges and worked in various companies before we came together to make our own game.
<br/><br/>We liked different types of games and had different preferences. However, our will to make our own game compensated for these differences.
  
  Our first attempt was to create a sports game. Soon, we realized that we needed too much resources and knew very little about ways to get them. In the end, we failed. <br/><br/>Since then, we made other utilities and worked on subcontracted development and design projects. Nonetheless, we once again began to design our own game, and, this time, we were going to see it through.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></p>

<br/><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">When we made the outline for new our game, we again came up with a demanding plan. The project was stalled for about a year. We lacked the manpower as well as the resources. <br/><br/>Continuous funding was needed to create such large amount of contents. Nonetheless, we have finally completed all the structures for the foundational system. <br/><br/>However, we still have to develop more contents and secure more stable system structure. We need your help and your interest. <br/>Please help us present our game to the world.</p>

<br/><br/>Nevertheless, we will not give up. We have learned such valuable lessons working on our game, and will continue to make our own paths. We do not second doubt our ability to resolve problems. <br/><br/>If you can show us your interest and help our project, we promise we will launch a game that will not disappoint you.<br/></b><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p></div>","‘BELLATOR’ is a single hand control mobile (iOS/Android) action game with battles played by various characters.

We are friends since high school. We nurtured our dreams while play games and reading comic books together. We went to separate colleges and worked in various companies before we came together to make our own game.
We liked different types of games and had different preferences. However, our will to make our own game compensated for these differences.
  
  Our first attempt was to create a sports game. Soon, we realized that we needed too much resources and knew very little about ways to get them. In the end, we failed. Since then, we made other utilities and worked on subcontracted development and design projects. Nonetheless, we once again began to design our own game, and, this time, we were going to see it through.


When we made the outline for new our game, we again came up with a demanding plan. The project was stalled for about a year. We lacked the manpower as well as the resources. Continuous funding was needed to create such large amount of contents. Nonetheless, we have finally completed all the structures for the foundational system. However, we still have to develop more contents and secure more stable system structure. We need your help and your interest. Please help us present our game to the world.

We are a small group made up of one CEO/Producer, one Concept/Director, one CDO, one CTO and two beginning programmers. Also, we have not yet established the publishing rights and stable server for the game. There are still many areas that need our attention.
Nevertheless, we will not give up. We have learned such valuable lessons working on our game, and will continue to make our own paths. We do not second doubt our ability to resolve problems. If you can show us your interest and help our project, we promise we will launch a game that will not disappoint you.",97.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><h2>Why Indiegogo?</h2>
<p><span>The challenge for a game programmer is to end the game. The game programmer likes the process of making a game and yet he will come in with “a light purse”. The publisher doesn’t like a game itself but he likes successful games. He always has resources to bring a game to an end, the so-called “final kick”.  We have no publisher, in-game purchases, paid DLC as well as a charge for beta testing. We have made the game based not on camouflaged casino that makes money on you but the game at the heart of which is competitive spirit, drive and fun. We like making games and that is why we need your “final kick”. </span></p>

<br/>
<h3>Cars</h3>
<p><span>Besides their exterior, all the vehicles introduced in the game differ in key features such as speed, armor, maneuverability, capabilities and special-purpose weapons. That makes it possible for each player to find his playing style. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463757243/DG_CarTable_yjndxp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Weapons</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>There are 6 main types of weapons and 4 special weapons with 4 fire modes in the game. The weapon is balanced and has advantages and disadvantages. When choosing a weapon you have to take into account the speed and distance to an enemy and consider how severely his car is damaged, whether his shield is turned on and other factors.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""325"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2FIjuM5hZLvIZUc%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&amp;src_secure=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fgifs%2Fgame-car-dieselguns-IjuM5hZLvIZUc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FIjuM5hZLvIZUc%2Fgiphy-downsized-large.gif&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=giphy"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>Not only do you have to change the weapon for the required one quickly but also to use its fire mode properly. Every weapon has 4 fire modes: main, secondary, alternate and alternate secondary. The alternate fire requires 5 or more shells but it has much greater fire power. <p></p>
<p></p>

<div><br/></div><div>
<h3>Energy</h3>
<p><span>Energy is a special resource replenished at the expense of damage or at high speed. You will always have to choose the way to consume energy: using nitro to overtake an enemy, the shield to protect from damage, jumps up to hard-to-get-at places or some special vehicle capability.</span></p>

<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Bonuses &amp; Power-Ups</span><br/>
</h3>
<p><span>Like in classic shooter games “Quake” and “Unreal Tournament” you should explore characteristics of the battle arena and be acutely aware of the place where valuable bonuses and weapons are. Apart from basic bonuses restoring an armor, energy and shields there are also valuable bonuses that make a jump higher, power – greater and damage - severer. In addition to it, you need to choose three power assists that will help you uncover your tactical potential fully. </span></p>

Why Indiegogo?
The challenge for a game programmer is to end the game. The game programmer likes the process of making a game and yet he will come in with “a light purse”. The publisher doesn’t like a game itself but he likes successful games. He always has resources to bring a game to an end, the so-called “final kick”.  We have no publisher, in-game purchases, paid DLC as well as a charge for beta testing. We have made the game based not on camouflaged casino that makes money on you but the game at the heart of which is competitive spirit, drive and fun. We like making games and that is why we need your “final kick”. 
Having received money we are planning to purchase the content and software, localize the game and rent servers.

The Game






Cars
Besides their exterior, all the vehicles introduced in the game differ in key features such as speed, armor, maneuverability, capabilities and special-purpose weapons. That makes it possible for each player to find his playing style. 



Weapons

There are 6 main types of weapons and 4 special weapons with 4 fire modes in the game. The weapon is balanced and has advantages and disadvantages. When choosing a weapon you have to take into account the speed and distance to an enemy and consider how severely his car is damaged, whether his shield is turned on and other factors.
Not only do you have to change the weapon for the required one quickly but also to use its fire mode properly. Every weapon has 4 fire modes: main, secondary, alternate and alternate secondary. The alternate fire requires 5 or more shells but it has much greater fire power. 







Energy
Energy is a special resource replenished at the expense of damage or at high speed. You will always have to choose the way to consume energy: using nitro to overtake an enemy, the shield to protect from damage, jumps up to hard-to-get-at places or some special vehicle capability.




Bonuses & Power-Ups

Like in classic shooter games “Quake” and “Unreal Tournament” you should explore characteristics of the battle arena and be acutely aware of the place where valuable bonuses and weapons are. Apart from basic bonuses restoring an armor, energy and shields there are also valuable bonuses that make a jump higher, power – greater and damage - severer. In addition to it, you need to choose three power assists that will help you uncover your tactical potential fully.

</div><p><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
<p>Fantasy Dimension The Card Game is a dark fantasy CCG (known as Collectible Card Game, TCG, Trading Card
Game). It was inspired by Magic The Gathering and some other card games, but
offers completely different gameplay and rules.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<p>* No random factors during the duels - fair play where thinking and tactics are the key<br/>
* Balanced cards - fair play with no much better cards at same value, but benefits in specific strategy or occasion<br/>
* 160+ unique cards - no cards with all exactly the same attributes<br/>
* Customizable main character - adjustable factors that affect style of playing<br/>
* Progressive deck building - new random cards for exchange after each victory<br/>
* Generated enemies - each duel offers enemy prepared with random factors<br/>
* Dark Fantasy theme - no disneyland, no japan<br/>
* Imaginative - old book style drawings<br/>
* Multiplatform - browser based (Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS, and other)<br/>
* FREE - ad based, no microtransactions, no pay2win</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>GAMEPLAY</b></p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, player chooses one of few starter decks and difficulty modes.<br/>
Main character can be customized with attributes like endurance (starter health points for each duel), power (starter mana points for each duel) and number of maximum cards in deck, which allows to take various strategies of playing style.<br/>
Deck can have 20 cards (extendable to maximum of 30 cards with character attributes), but during combat all cards are available, each one can be used multiple times (if there is enough available power to cast, but once per turn), some units can offer own abilities to activate, and there are few basic spell cards that do not count to deck maximum.<br/>
This way, randomness and luck have been mostly eliminated from the game.<br/>
Victory unlocks new random card that goes to the library.<br/>
Deck content can be exchanged with content from the library before each duel.<br/>
There are unit and spell cards, where unit can summon specific character to the battlefield, and spell can direcly modify own units, enemy units, own main character or enemy main character.<br/>
There are no cards with all exactly the same attributes.<br/>
There are no cards that are much better than others in the same cost, but benefits of each card can be noticed in specific strategy or occasion.<br/>
If unit on battlefield activates special ability that is not passive, then it is done instead of attacking and costs no power.<br/>
Overall game rules are focused on a fair balance.<br/>
At the beginning of the duel, main character has starter power points (amount depends on character attributes), and gets small amount of new ones each turn which can be increased by some units or spells.<br/>
Each main character can cast one card per turn (unless it is a card with attribute that allows to cast another) for cost of required power, and use one special ability of each summoned character per turn.<br/>
Battlefield is divided into 5 slots for own units, and 5 slots for enemy units.<br/>
Basically, each unit (that was not used to activate ability, immobilized or summoned in current turn, except ones with special abilities) attacks enemy unit on opposite field or enemy main character (if there is no unit) in end of each turn, but this range can be modified by special abilities or spells.<br/>
The duel ends when one of main characters has endurance below 1 point.</p><p>Example cards:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456871637/qpcbgiadvw3xvkoide4o.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456871664/elkwzb6brlg71d8drla5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456871690/qjujptg44den0fcutqbi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>Early Pre-Alpha:<br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">- only 60 cards of total 160<br/></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">- no direct spell cards yet<br/></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">- basic Artifical Intelligence<br/></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">- minimal interface</span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fft_zcXyem3Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dft_zcXyem3Q&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fft_zcXyem3Q%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><br/>

</div></div>","Hi
My name is Butch Binneman, a 71 year old South African, resident in Cape Town.
I have been active in the Cape Flats communities for over 40 years, assisting with business development on a pro-bono basis.
Globally it is difficult for those less fortunate to acquire capital for any kind of income producing activity.
In order to assist with the eradication of the need to carry cash in crime ridden communities, and provide a method to access capital, the Mobile Payment Method (MPM APP) was created.
After extensive research it became apparent that MPM was unique in concept and capability, and was provisionally patented for me by well known patent attorney, Brian Bacon, of Cape Town.
Contributors will receive a detailed description of the MPM APP.
I have a registered company styled Mobiching (Pty) Ltd and the domain name mobiching.co.za (see logo and tag line) that will be used in the MPM roll-out in South Africa.
A portion of the distributable income from Mobiching (Pty) Ltd will be applied as a cash flow guarantee to funding institutions, to raise capital for ED (Enterprise Development) throughout South Africa, using registered co-operatives.
Please visit www.cofisa.co.za for information on financial co-operatives
Many ""cottage industry"" possibilities have been detailed that suit the skills available in the communities being targeted. 
Specific programmes at schools will provide uniforms, school feeding, books and approximately 35 sustainable jobs per school of 1000 pupils.
MPM can be used for the remotest communities to transact, as long as there is internet coverage.
MPM uses a double PIN security method and does not require any personal or banking information to be divulged.
Current ""Tap & Go"" methods do not have PIN control and the transactional amount is consequently limited.
MPM limits are the same as those set by your bank.
Bank particulars of users are cloud stored with HCE and NFC technologies applied.
Other payment APPS require funds to be deposited in the operators account before use.
MPM is limited only by the funds or credit available to you from your bank.
With the availability of NFC enabled SIM cards, non enabled mobiles can do a SIM Swap and become capable.
MPM offers a unique Agent/Principal option that allows agents to sell goods on behalf of a principal, with funds going directly to the bank account of the principal.
MPM offers the usual coupon availability feature.

    What We Need & What You Get
You will note under ""Perks"" that an amount of One Dollar is entered. This is to allow as many people as possible to participate.

Larger amounts are most welcome.
We need global support because the MPM APP can be applied in any country to give benefits to the less fortunate or previously disadvantaged.
Because the MPM APP is used commercially it generates income from transaction fees.
Transaction fees provide running costs and profits to the operators, with a portion of the profit providing a cash flow recognised by financial institutions as a means to repay capital.
When the borrowed capital, serviced by the profit portion, is used to create an income producing enterprise, more sustainable jobs are created with a lifestyle change for the beneficiary participants.
No more begging for hand-outs and charity - help create the vehicle to fund self-empowerment, whilst the world at large benefits from the reduction in costs related to cash circulation.  
Each contributor will get the opportunity to use the MPM APP in their region, for a project of their choice that meets the ""benefit to others"" criteria. The operating rules will be made available to contributors.
Participation in the above amazing perk will be graded according to the contribution made, but every contributor can become involved.
The funding target will establish the highest commercial activity possible for MPM in South Africa, and give global exposure to the process and opportunity.
The global network of contributors will form the core of other networks and provide a platform for self funding philanthropy.
I have personally provided the funding for the MPM process and earlier knowledge gaining pro-bono activities, and will continue funding the South African launch of MPM, regardless of the response from contributors.
The contributors will MAKE IT HAPPEN globally, empowering themselves and others.
A website, currently under construction, will provide continuous updates on projects benefiting from the MPM method.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Being an avid collector of enamel pins, I originally made this pin as a whim. This was just a little project for me. However, in light of recent events, I've made the decision to make this pin not for profit.

<p>The Cool Cuke Pin is 1.25"" soft enamel pin with a rubber backing. They will be produced by a third party. I will be paying for production of the pins out of my own pocket.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Concept x Gameplay</h3>
<p>An idea of making western maps full of horse chases, dynamic shootouts and large areas of classical Wild West setting was inspired by observing plenty of movies (e.g. <i>The Hateful Eight, 3:10 to Yuma)</i>, TV shows (e.g.<i>Westworld)</i> and games (e.g. <i>Red Dead Redemption)</i>. We also want to gracefully expand somewhat dull and boring gameplay of ordinary CS:GO.</p>
<p>At this moment, we consider the following concepts of our western-themed maps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big Player vs. Player map</li>
<li>'cs_'-like styled gamemode with hostage and 2 teams</li>
<li>Cooperative map with cutscenes and linear gameplay</li>

<p><strong>Cyber Unity</strong> is a game with an attitude. It’s all about what humans are already coming in contact with and what may come to pass in the near future. The game is imbued with an atmosphere of a technocratic future and the energy of human superpowers.</p>
<p>Controlling the two protagonists in each of the four corporations ensures the dynamics of the gaming processes. The player characters’ ability of to travel to a parallel universe provides additional possibilities both to replenish the energy resource and influence opponents.</p>
<p>Online battles, narrative and daily missions, and the PvP mode create a special atmosphere of sustained interest and anticipation.</p>
<p>The turn-based combat strategy always allows enough time to think out the next move while maintaining the sense of freedom of movement of regular role-playing games.</p>
<p>The <strong>Cyber Unity</strong> team has been working on the project for thirteen months now and the game will be released on the market in December 2016 with its well-established ideas of turn-based strategies. We have taken risks to show the whole world our vision of the game because we believe in our ideas and are certain that they will be adopted and appreciated by the gaming community. The development of the project is almost over. Crowdfunding is yet another opportunity for us to promote the game and raise money for marketing. However, we are not going to remain indebted, and we will offer gamers the opportunity to acquire in-game bonuses, free PvP subscription and much more at a special price. The game was developed by a team of professionals who are passionate about their work, excited about their creation and its future users.

</div></div>","Cyber Unity is a game with an attitude. It’s all about what humans are already coming in contact with and what may come to pass in the near future. The game is imbued with an atmosphere of a technocratic future and the energy of human superpowers.
Controlling the two protagonists in each of the four corporations ensures the dynamics of the gaming processes. The player characters’ ability of to travel to a parallel universe provides additional possibilities both to replenish the energy resource and influence opponents.
Online battles, narrative and daily missions, and the PvP mode create a special atmosphere of sustained interest and anticipation.
The turn-based combat strategy always allows enough time to think out the next move while maintaining the sense of freedom of movement of regular role-playing games.
The Cyber Unity team has been working on the project for thirteen months now and the game will be released on the market in December 2016 with its well-established ideas of turn-based strategies. We have taken risks to show the whole world our vision of the game because we believe in our ideas and are certain that they will be adopted and appreciated by the gaming community. The development of the project is almost over. Crowdfunding is yet another opportunity for us to promote the game and raise money for marketing. However, we are not going to remain indebted, and we will offer gamers the opportunity to acquire in-game bonuses, free PvP subscription and much more at a special price. The game was developed by a team of professionals who are passionate about their work, excited about their creation and its future users. This passion has fed into the game and is behind the game’s extraordinary effect. After completing just a couple of missions, you will be captured by the game’s atmosphere, and after a while the thoughts and feelings produced by the game will slowly make their way into your real life.

<p>The main character is a
woman, named Sandra she is an engineer, who is trapped in a space station.</p>
<p>Space station is filled
by dangerous “security” droids, creatures, and some humans.</p>
<p>The objective of the
game is to uncover the mystery of the space station and escape it alive. </p>
<p>To fulfill the game's
objective, the player needs to uncover various documents that provide data
about ingame lore, as well as clues that will help solving various puzzles
within the space station.</p>
<p>The carrying capacity of
the player is limited. Character items that the player does not wish to carry
at the moment can be stored into an item shelter to be retrieved for later use.
</p>
<p>To save their progress,
the player must pick up a “data drive” and use it on any of the computer
terminals scattered through checkpoint locations in the game. </p>
<p>However, the supply of a
“data drives” player can acquire is limited, much like the player's ammo and
healing supplies.</p>
<p>Players will encounter
and fight various enemies: security droids and unseen creatures…</p>
<p>To restore the
character's health, player needs to use first-aid sprays</p>
<p>Key items are also
available that give the player access to other items or new areas.</p>
<p>Player can arm the
character with weapons to defend herself from enemies, although the ammunition
available for each firearm is limited and the player must learn to save ammo
for situations where it is really needed. </p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446039776/ui05bflawjihg9prnply.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><div>
<br/>
<p>The
game begins on November 7, year 2057, when humans were already starting to
explore the galaxy more easily. Humans have expanded their knowledge and have
started to explore new resources on other planets.</p>
<p>Space
explorers team “Fiza” was exploring the galaxy and was hit by small asteroid
rain which done some serious damage to the spaceship. “Fiza” team started
looking for nearest space station to get parts and repairs. Commander knew that
all spare parts stations were too far, and the closest private space station to
their location was named “EVE” which was under the authority of company
“Scorpion3D”. But this station looked like it was abandoned for some time…</p>
<p>“Fiza”
team did not have many choices, so they were trying to reach “EVE” as soon as
possible. “Fiza” crew decided to land on “EVE” and start searching for required
or adoptable parts in order fix the spaceship, unfortunately the spaceship was
damaged badly and started to fall into pieces. The team was trying to reach
evacuation pod’s section. After first evacuation pod launch the ship got
engulfed in flames and everything exploded. No one from the crew survived.
Sandra’s evacuation pod was damaged badly. Sandra was in space a few kilometers
away from “EVE” and in few minutes time she reached “EVE” safely. </p>
<p>While
Sandra was trying to figure out how to fix the damaged evacuation pod, and send
the “SOS” message. A “mechanical sound” rings out, and Sandra moves to
investigate. At this point, Player takes control of the character and begins to
explore the “EVE”.<span>  By exploring the
station she realizes that the station is fully operational. While searching the
area for further clues, Sandra is attacked by a “security” droid…</span></p>
<p>After
the fight with security droid Sandra finds one of the first discoveries - there
is a main computer named “R.I.F”. In order to gather more information from the
“RIF” Sandra needs to fix the “RIF”, as computer is informing about malware and
virus existence on the operating system. It is disabling almost all
functionality of the “RIF”.</p>
<p>While
searching the station, Sandra finds a human body and a communications
transmitter near it. Sandra eventually finds the “EVE” station to be riddled
with puzzles, traps, and horrors. Scattered documents suggest that a series of
experiments were being taken under the authority and supervision of the
nanotechnology and weapon technology company “<b>Scorpion3D</b>”. The samples have been taken from unknown planet named
“Entor”. After these experiments the scientists got exposed to samples and
everything gone terribly wrong.</p>
<p>After
navigating a series of station blocks Sandra discovers a laboratory which
contains<span>  new types of weapons unseen by
human eyes.</span></p>
<p>In
there she will find the operating system for the “RIF”.<span>  </span></p>
<p>In
the lab Sandra gathers information about the planet “Entor” and more clues
about planet’s location coordinates. “<b>Scorpion3D</b>”
corporation is covering all tracks about this planet. </p>
<p>In
the next game block Sandra finds the broken and ripped open security droids,
aggressive organic creatures which are attacking her. During the battle
previous levels will be damaged and Sandra cannot get back. She needs to look
for another way to go back to the “RIF”</p>
<p>Sandra
is back on track on the primary quest and<span> 
should look for the parts to fix the evacuation pod. Exploring continues
…..</span></p>

Now I have a prototype of the game and I hope to 
turn it into a complete game.I chose IndieGoGo because it's a very open funding platform, and I 
hope to raise enough money to make a fully functional Single Player for our game. Software: Help me afford the essential software needed for pushing this game forward.Music & Audio: I will hire compositor to compose a full fledged soundtrack to the game. Animators: I will hire high qualified animators to help me provide characters with proper animation. I want you to be able to feel the ENTOR Breakout universe.Programmers: In order to do a proper single player 
game you need good A.I and lore. I have extremely innovative ideas on 
improving A.I beyond what you have seen in traditional games, and good 
things take time to develop.Translators: The PC version of ENTOR Breakout should be fully localized into English.Polish: I generally don't like releasing anything 
unless it has undergone a lot of polish. So your money will also go to 
making everything the best it can be.
I've decided to use IndieGoGo because I feel I can only innovate 
without barriers by remaining independent. I enjoy communicating 
directly with you and I love all your ideas for the game. This is what 
makes developing games so special to me, it's fun, it's innovative, I 
get to share with you, and I feel the need to create.

The main character is a
woman, named Sandra she is an engineer, who is trapped in a space station.
Space station is filled
by dangerous “security” droids, creatures, and some humans.
The objective of the
game is to uncover the mystery of the space station and escape it alive. 
To fulfill the game's
objective, the player needs to uncover various documents that provide data
about ingame lore, as well as clues that will help solving various puzzles
within the space station.
The carrying capacity of
the player is limited. Character items that the player does not wish to carry
at the moment can be stored into an item shelter to be retrieved for later use.

To save their progress,
the player must pick up a “data drive” and use it on any of the computer
terminals scattered through checkpoint locations in the game. 
However, the supply of a
“data drives” player can acquire is limited, much like the player's ammo and
healing supplies.
Players will encounter
and fight various enemies: security droids and unseen creatures…
To restore the
character's health, player needs to use first-aid sprays
Key items are also
available that give the player access to other items or new areas.
Player can arm the
character with weapons to defend herself from enemies, although the ammunition
available for each firearm is limited and the player must learn to save ammo
for situations where it is really needed. 

The
game begins on November 7, year 2057, when humans were already starting to
explore the galaxy more easily. Humans have expanded their knowledge and have
started to explore new resources on other planets.
Space
explorers team “Fiza” was exploring the galaxy and was hit by small asteroid
rain which done some serious damage to the spaceship. “Fiza” team started
looking for nearest space station to get parts and repairs. Commander knew that
all spare parts stations were too far, and the closest private space station to
their location was named “EVE” which was under the authority of company
“Scorpion3D”. But this station looked like it was abandoned for some time…
“Fiza”
team did not have many choices, so they were trying to reach “EVE” as soon as
possible. “Fiza” crew decided to land on “EVE” and start searching for required
or adoptable parts in order fix the spaceship, unfortunately the spaceship was
damaged badly and started to fall into pieces. The team was trying to reach
evacuation pod’s section. After first evacuation pod launch the ship got
engulfed in flames and everything exploded. No one from the crew survived.
Sandra’s evacuation pod was damaged badly. Sandra was in space a few kilometers
away from “EVE” and in few minutes time she reached “EVE” safely. 
While
Sandra was trying to figure out how to fix the damaged evacuation pod, and send
the “SOS” message. A “mechanical sound” rings out, and Sandra moves to
investigate. At this point, Player takes control of the character and begins to
explore the “EVE”.  By exploring the
station she realizes that the station is fully operational. While searching the
area for further clues, Sandra is attacked by a “security” droid…
After
the fight with security droid Sandra finds one of the first discoveries - there
is a main computer named “R.I.F”. In order to gather more information from the
“RIF” Sandra needs to fix the “RIF”, as computer is informing about malware and
virus existence on the operating system. It is disabling almost all
functionality of the “RIF”.
While
searching the station, Sandra finds a human body and a communications
transmitter near it. Sandra eventually finds the “EVE” station to be riddled
with puzzles, traps, and horrors. Scattered documents suggest that a series of
experiments were being taken under the authority and supervision of the
nanotechnology and weapon technology company “Scorpion3D”. The samples have been taken from unknown planet named
“Entor”. After these experiments the scientists got exposed to samples and
everything gone terribly wrong.
After
navigating a series of station blocks Sandra discovers a laboratory which
contains  new types of weapons unseen by
human eyes.
In
there she will find the operating system for the “RIF”.  
In
the lab Sandra gathers information about the planet “Entor” and more clues
about planet’s location coordinates. “Scorpion3D”
corporation is covering all tracks about this planet. 
In
the next game block Sandra finds the broken and ripped open security droids,
aggressive organic creatures which are attacking her. During the battle
previous levels will be damaged and Sandra cannot get back. She needs to look
for another way to go back to the “RIF”
Sandra
is back on track on the primary quest and 
should look for the parts to fix the evacuation pod. Exploring continues
…..

50000 eur.
Only first episode of the game will be created from planned total of six episodes. As a lone warrior in the battlefield is just a lone warrior. In any case, this amount and more of the money will be spent on software licenses as in this stage I need tools with no restrictions to complete this work. No worries, it is my dream to tell you this story. That means I will never give up until I see it fully completed.

125000 eur.We all have families and friends, and I am very lucky that my friends know about game programming, animation, and give their best to help complete the game. But they have their own jobs and cannot fully commit to the project. They  don't believe that people like you could help me to lure them to reach the game's full functionality and potential. In any case, I could perform such tasks myself, but I don't have a clone machine for multiplying myself.
300000 eur.If You will help me reach this amount, all development team would be built and  work on the project full-time. I believe in other people and I trust that they can achieve something great.

With ENTOR
BreakOut, my goal is to create a 1st 3rd person type of

an easy thing. It can be difficult to predict the stumbling blocks even in the
best case scenario, so is with new project as ENTOR BreakOut. 
So even if you can’t 
afford to contribute yourself, you can still win this copy of the game if you 
manage to shepherd in the most money through your own connections and 
campaigning.!!!!!!!!! TAKE YOUR FREE GAME!!!!!!!!!!The more noise we make, the more money we’ll raise, and the more likely this campaign will keep Entor BreakOut and its community growing. Help share this campaign on your social networks and other medias, so 
that more people will know about this campaign. As this game is also 
trying to make its way onto Steam. We’ll be awarding persons whoever brings the most 
contributions in using IndieGoGo’s sharing tools.

concerns, don't hesitate to contact me. I will be glad to answer! You can find me via: FaceBook, Twitter, WebSite.",27.0,0,"2 Campaigns

With Alice, who has two big sluggish eyes called “dead fish eyes”. Players have to help her to get her favorable cakes with basic tap and slide. For command her to attack and jump. To defend all the blocking or enemies. <br/><br/>Two years later, we launched Alice Running Adventure. It updated to 3D. She can explore this amazing land, to find her favorable cake in 3D. There are more than 150 stages for helping Alice reaches her dream. Player also help her to solve all things faced in this area. <br/><br/>Now the VR (Virtual Reality) era is here. We have planned to launch Alice Running in VR. The first step we have already published Alice Running VR Edition. This is a Demo of Alice Running in Wonderworld. Next , we want to publish on more powerful platforms.<br/><br/>For more powerful platforms, we need more resource. We already collected a lot of experience on building 2D and 3D games. New resource can help us on increasing more contents, to reach more platforms and giving player more fun. That is the Alice Running we wanna build.</p><h3>How to Play</h3><p>Player act as Alice, control her running, flying and many other skills to reach the goal. Alice have a lot of skills to help her. Like attack, moving object....</p><p>The world provide a lot of items, to give her many different upgrade. For example, it makes her bigger or smaller. It may give advantage to her. But sometime, it is a disadvantage.</p><p>There are a number of stages waiting for player complete. Those stages have a lot of different targets and secrets. Player may play again the completed stages. To find out and reach all of these.</p><h3>You can now download the Alice Running VR Edition (Demo) via following links:</h3><p>iOS: <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/hu/app/alice-running-vr-edition/id1092958125"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://itunes.apple.com/hu/app/alice-running-vr-edition/id1092958125</a></p><p>Android: <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qvq.aliceVR"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=c...</a></p><h3>What you can see in this Alice Running in Wonderworld:</h3><div>

 Daniel Mauricio Porras Bulla - DeveloperHi,  I’m a generalist video game developer from Colombia. I have knowdledge on all the aspects of making a video game, certified by different educational institutions and companies I’ve worked for. Although I consider myself autodidact.  You are helping me change my life, making a great future for my family, I will always remember the people who helped me making AOR come true :) Lina Fernanda Ramírez Lamprea - MarketingHi, I’m a graphic designer from Colombia, I have 3 years of experience working on websites administration, graphic design and community management. I’m glad to support Daniel on the development of this project; I’ll be here posting news frequently and answering your questions.  Daniel Ferrán Porras Ramírez - The BossHi, I’m Daniel Ferran, I'm 1 year old from Colombia, my job it’s to make my parents smile whenever they are stress out and remind them this must get done and hurry up. Also I like playing music and videogames too.    I started the development of Anthem of Roses on 2012 by the name of Metrox Evolution Studios. At first it was made on 2D using Macromedia flash 8, ActionScript2, but then the software was suddenly very incompatible and that stopped the project at 70% of it's development on Spanish. At the beginning the soundtrack used the standard midi sound library, it had a 16 bit videogame sound, now I have great tools to remaster it, I’m looking forward to use the East West Sound Libraries, also now I have licenses to use professional synthesizers like UHE DIVA. Watch the 2012 alpha version here.In 2014 I received a proposal from Bulkypix for publishing the game, but I declined this opportunity since the game was made on Macromedia flash 8 and they wanted to publish this for IOS.At that time I tough I could make a version on 2.5D, and I decided to do it on Unity. Later on 2016 I worked on a version with a toon / cell shading style, but still the art didn't work as I expected and 3D basic art was way too far from the original idea.  Over the years I’ve learned a lot on videogames developing. Now the game could be released on PC, Ios, Mac and Linux and even consoles. The game would be developed on Unity 2017 other software implied is Maya, Mudbox, Adobe Suite, Guitar Pro, Cantabile, Audacity and sound libraries.Checkout out some Anthem of Roses tracks on Soundcloud (some of this tracks are on the current Alpha Demo):   Get the news on how this indie videogame becomes a reality, every week on gamejolt and indieDB! Posts will be on our website blog and videos on our youtube channel too. We’ll let you know about the struggles and achivements on the journey of making Anthem of Roses.     $10.000 dollars is enough money to make a video game? Living in Tibasosa, Colombia is way cheaper than living in the United States or Europe, almost 2/3 cheaper.

<p><strong>Hero Of Not Our Time</strong> is a non-standard RPG combining elements of a text quest, a classic rogue-like and turn-based strategy. The player will have to move from the left side of the field to the right while slaying various monsters that get in the way. There will be times that will call for extremely cruel, sadistic and absurd ways to clear location after location. </p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Hero Of Not Our Time is a non-standard RPG combining elements of a text quest, a classic rogue-like and turn-based strategy. The player will have to move from the left side of the field to the right while slaying various monsters that get in the way. There will be times that will call for extremely cruel, sadistic and absurd ways to clear location after location. 

This whole bloody mess will be accompanied by dynamic soundtracks that will make you kill!
 
The player will be able to pay for things with his blood. Literally. If you are still not scared enough then the powerful bosses who will not let you get bored will make your life better :)
We were inspired by many games, such as:

Hotline Miami
Dark Souls
Half-Life
Risk of Rain
Doom
Snatcher
Terraria

 

 

Six powerful bosses that are waiting for you ;) 
Original combat system
 

More than twenty different player powerups! 
A custom weapon having many assembly combinations!   

More than fifty merciless monsters that will not give you a pass  

The design of the game is made in a pixel cyberpunk style. Feel youreself in a distant future of the interplanetary scale! 
Blood stains, pieces of meat and basically all the red color - all that brings brutality to the game...  

The use of occult *snap* magic! 

Your every action is stored in the dialog box 

The help of your brave pet :0 
And many other...

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding to pay work hours for our team and for end-stage game distribution and production finishing.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The mental health crisis is a global concern. The biggest challenge, followed closely by stigma, is a lack of access to learning and management tools.

They are often seen as a symptom with several different mental health diagnoses, including schizophrenia, clinical depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and several others. House of Echoes is intended to be a disquieting journey through the realm of hallucination and to introduce management methods throughout the game for those who live with this symptom.</p>

House of Echoes is intended to be a disquieting journey through the realm of hallucination and to introduce management methods throughout the game for those who live with this symptom.

After the Titans is a deck-building card game in a 100 card closed set with all the game mechanics of collectible trading card games. An indie game by two game enthusiasts in Houston, the Core Set has been well received by local game shops and board & card gamers.This is an all or nothing campaign to get our newly tested and approved Expansion Packs printed and in your hands, while sharing the fun of After the Titans with others.

What is After the Titans?



My name is Homer Carroll, and After the Titans© is my debut game. It spawned from my passion for collectible card games and the need to have a quick fun game that my non-gaming friends could learn easily without investing time and money to enjoy it. It has been so much fun sharing this game with friends and having complete strangers play it and want a copy on the spot.

After the Titans© is a themed gateway card drafting game. This game encompasses all the fun of deck building collectible card games, without the time and money investment found in similar games. Game play is designed to be brisk and competitive. The Core Set is made for 2-4 Devotees, and one game lasts approximately 5 minutes per Devotee.




Each deck includes the After the Titans© 100 Card Core Set & Instructions
Core Set Contents: 100 cards: 10 Zeus Spells, 10 Athena Spells, 10 Ares Spells, 10 Apollo Spells, 40 Worship Cards, and 20 Beast Spells.
Command beasts, summon mystical objects, and worship your gods to increase your power and cast spells to eliminate other Devotees.





What's in the Expansion Packs?The After the Titans© Expansion Packs will add a total of seven gods, completing the Pantheon, and adding new abilities like drawing additional cards, stealing cards from Devotees, increasing the Boons produced for Worship, and protection from Spells and Beasts!


Expansion Pack Contents: 20 cards: 10 Spells, 5 Beasts, and 5 Worship Cards.

The new gods: Hermes, Hera, Poseidon, Aphrodite, Persephone, Hades, and Hephaestus.


Here's a peek at a few of the Expansion Pack cards from each new god.
Hephaestus, bitter and ostracized, makes himself a fortress to keep others out.
Poseidon allows Devotees to draw additional cards, greatly increasing the speed at which deadly force can be achieved.
Hermes, the thief and courier, shifts the score and perception of battle. The rules themselves are subject for dispute as long as Hermes is around.
Hades waits in darkness, capitalizing off the misfortune of others; feigning weakness to cozen his opponents into their own demise.
Aphrodite spreads love and beauty to all Devotees. Charity is so endearing that none stop to ask, ""to what end?""
Hera, Queen of the Gods, takes what she desires as all things are hers to do with as she pleases.

Persephone yearns for growth. Her unquenched needs spawn forth abundance for all Devotees.





   The Campaign Purpose 
To launch the Expansion Packs, the printing must first be funded.  The bigger the order, the less it costs per pack of cards, which is what the money collected will go towards. Additionally, the amount of each Expansion Pack desired will provide information on how many of each to order.

<div>I believe you may be interested about our work.</div>
<div>Hi, I am your passional typical gamer. I been working hard in this project since a while and I represent 8 wonderful co-workers that are giving their best to finally create our little company of games. We are going to create games for a Half and Full Dive Virtual Reality.. Yes Full Dive.. but how? we do not even have those technologies yet right?. Well we are developing that technology too.</div>
<div>We have been working on the games developing and we have three already: One Moba game, the typical Mmorpg and one Fps.</div>
<div>The project began with other two friends and me. Later we needed to contract more because of the heavy load of work.  Thanks to that we made more friends with our same passion.</div>
<div>One of our friends say this technology could help people and change the world but honestly, at least for me, I do it because of my passion for games. It depends on people and how they see the world, at the end its your decision.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Games, Technology and Synapse</h3>
<div>Around two months ago we lost our financial support (my work) and we can still survive because of my savings. Our monthly payment is 200 dollars for each one (that includes me),  but still we are facing bigger problems because we were preparing to move our project to California (USA) and won't be possible in our actual situation. plus we wanted to contract 11 more people to be a team of 20 at least. </div>
<div>Our actual ""Art Team"" its just one person and most of us repeat in our different teams. Most of us have other jobs and right now I am working to keep funding the project.</div>
<div>If you help us, we make the compromise of not charging to the donators any monthly fee and consider you for some special perks in-game in our three games.  from special clothes, special devices, special weapons with signs.. something you can show-off!, for those who donate a lot, <span>we could meet you in person to thank you and more.</span>
</div>
<div><span>Currently we already made some improving to the headset design. In simple words to make it cheaper than other devices almost by half. We still need to adapt a lot of things and develop more, that is why we need your support.</span></div>
<div><span>Mapping the signals of the human is not simple, thats why we need to get more workers. Your resources will go to rent a place where we will open our offices, a place to work but too a place to live. If we live in the same house we can lower the living expenses and focus in work all days. We need a lot of material and devices to help us.</span></div>
<div><span>Traveling to check new technologies to keep our device updated its hard when you have low budget.  But if we do not reach our goal or get any sponsor,  we will still use the resources to keep going and try our best. We are not surrendering because this is our passion and we believe in this.  Right now we are preparing everything and we hope to have our company working with at least those three games in four to six years.</span></div>

The improved resource (farmland, forest, mine, ...) gives more production to the nearby city and the improved facilities (barrack, wall, court, ...) give more power to the player's units and cities.</p><p>The game is semi-turn-based, each unit type has a different time to next move or act after the previous action, so that (for example) you move your Settlers unit at 10pm if the last action has been performed at 8pm with this unit because of the Settlers unit has two hours per action ""speed"".</p><p>The players choose technologies to research to improve their cities and units and allow to build new units or facilities. You can earn technology points and you can improve your technology point income by improve facilities in your cities and improve resources nearby your cities.</p><p>The players can initiate negotiations with the neighborhoods, so that you have the decision to declare war, make peace, remain neutral or organize an empire with them.

Rule your empire, fight or cooperate with thousands of players: this is Golden Age of Civilizations!


Here comes the Golden Age of Civilizations, a semi turn-based MMO strategy game, inspired by, but not following by the classic games of the genre, such as Age of Empires, Civilization and Rise of Nations; mixed up with MMO capability and flavored with the best parts of other good online games.Who am I?My name is Gábor Auth, a Java developer, a Linux administrator, an IT architect, organizer of some meetups topic of Java and IT in Hungary and speaker of some IT conference. Here is my CV:http://wiki.javaforum.hu/display/~auth.gabor/Curriculum+VitaeWhat is it?I have a dream: I'm going to create an MMO strategy game! :)The players can move or act with their units on the map, build new cities and units, build and improve resources nearby their cities and facilities in their cities. The improved resource (farmland, forest, mine, ...) gives more production to the nearby city and the improved facilities (barrack, wall, court, ...) give more power to the player's units and cities.The game is semi-turn-based, each unit type has a different time to next move or act after the previous action, so that (for example) you move your Settlers unit at 10pm if the last action has been performed at 8pm with this unit because of the Settlers unit has two hours per action ""speed"".The players choose technologies to research to improve their cities and units and allow to build new units or facilities. You can earn technology points and you can improve your technology point income by improve facilities in your cities and improve resources nearby your cities.The players can initiate negotiations with the neighborhoods, so that you have the decision to declare war, make peace, remain neutral or organize an empire with them. Each empire has a government type (despotism, monarchy, republic, ...), so that the suitable players will be officers in the government of own empire.Would you like to try it?https://test.gacivs.infohttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.gacivs.android.testI have not finished yet, it runs only in browsers and Android cell phones, but it works. Join and play with hundreds of players! :)I want to release early and release often, so the current version is simple, but the feature set is growing week-to-week!What is it technically?I started working on my game on spring of 2014. I researched the possibly best architecture based on cutting edge technologies and industrial best practices, it is scalable vertically (better and bigger hardware) and horizontally (more hardware).I deployed it on cloud, I bought a domain name and SSL certifications, so I spent only a little more than $120 on this project, thanks a lot to open source and cloud technologies!Some technology facts about the project:
Agile development

Open source (LGPL 2.1)
Based on Java, JavaEE and JavaScript
The primary target platform is HTML5 browser
The secondary target platform is Android
The third target platform is iOS (and/or Windows Phone)

What do I need?
So, this is my hobby project, I do not need your money for expensive hardware and software components, I will focus only the game development and hire subcontractors for artworks and other tasks that I can't do.
What do you get?
The game will go to production with freemium model, the players can join free and play free, but they can pay for features and benefits. What features and benefits? Bonus experience points and you can distribute these points to various skills.And you can adopt a feature, a bug or an improvement!So, I have a dream... one day I will publish this game... please help me! :)Yes! You can help!Please support it, donate it, test it, share it on social networks, share your opinions with me, discuss about the game with your friends... :)LinksThe public test: https://test.gacivs.info/The Android test: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.gacivs.android.testSocialThe portal page: https://portal.gacivs.infoThe Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/gacivsThe Twitter page: https://twitter.com/gacivsThe Google+ page: https://plus.google.com/+GacivsInfoSite/",2.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Cry of the Dead is a series with five planned installments; the first is named Dacian. Though mostly linear, Dacian offers a few quests and options that can impact your play later in the game. Cry of the Dead exemplifies the value of inner strength despite adversity and the help that family--chosen or born--can bring. It also highlights the struggles that come with being different and experiencing great loss. Three of the four members of this team met through a forum seven years ago. After working with each other on several small projects, Zander decided to make things official and create a company: Jaded Phoenix Studios. He, Zack, and Jade struggled for a while to decide what project should gain first focus as a team. Due to Jade's immense passion and focus, Cry of the Dead won. The entire team believes it is a story and message needed in today's world.</p>
<p>In a world saturated with superstition, doubt and fear, one man must face his future before he can discern his past.</p>
<p>Unable to harness full control of the power that flows through his being, Dacian emits accidental bursts of magic at inopportune moments. These moments typically arise when he has become angry or enraged. His adoptive parents have sought to hide his abilities; but their efforts have proven to be in vain. The type of magic Dacian wields is not typical for humans, as such he is an oddity, in more ways than one. This provides a breeding ground for hate, stemming from ignorance.</p>
<p>The winds have changed, and danger lurks on the horizon. Something has begun corrupting the minds and bodies of living creatures; and it's spreading rapidly.</p>
<p>In order to discover his true self, Dacian must learn to control himself and his temper, and tackle his inner demons.</p>
<p>Mori, located in the world of Valkyr (Val-kay-ear), is a sleepy village tucked into a seaside cove, protected from the ocean by a large barrier reef. Its beaches are a tourist hot spot, and tourism is their main economy. The natives that inhabit Mori follow the ways of their ancestors. Fishers, hunters, gatherers, warriors: these are the main professions of Morians. The story takes place during the week leading up to the Ceremony of Mana, a very important coming of age ritual for Mori's youth.</p>
<p>Along with helping Dacian learn to control and understand his mysterious abilities by playing through his troubling dreams, players will get to build up the town's defenses and stores while experiencing its daily life.</p>

<p>To feel confident in our ability to complete this first installment, we will need $12,000. $10,500 enables us to pay our artists and musician for some more of their expertise as well as what they’ve already done. $600 goes to IndieGoGo for hosting our fundraiser. Another $600 is estimated for materials and shipping costs for our prizes. $300 goes to the boring, administrative parts of producing something commercial like trademarks and copyrights.</p>
<p>Perks range from a special thanks and mention on our website to a piece of custom art or music! In the lower tiers, you’ll find some really cool things like being listed as an author of a book in a travelling library. In the higher tiers, you’ll find a professionally published Art and Story Concept book which will include lore that couldn’t fit into the game as well as behind the scenes stories about the development of the project and art not scene in game!</p>
<p>If our goal is not met, the funds received will go directly toward the creation of more art and the completion of a fully playable demo featuring day one of nine. Once that demo is complete, you’ll see us back for another attempt to complete the missing eight days.</p>

<p>Cry of the Dead is unique in its vision because the author is of First Nations heritage. As such, much of the story, artwork, naming conventions, and cultures presented in its scope are based off of various First Nations tribes. Our team also represents a spectrum of minority groups and neuro-deviance, so the overall theme in Dacian of rising above adversity is something with which we all have a lot of experience.</p>
<p>Though the original demo was received incredibly well, we faced hurdles with the original engine’s limitations and ultimately decided to restart with a more reliable engine. This will be our first completed game, but the team has a plethora of success in other fields. (link to KT’s site, Quality Control, Zack’s Soundhound)</p>
<p>In addition to being a fun experience, we hope that Cry of the Dead will bring a greater awareness to the struggles facing First Nations throughout North America as well as other aboriginal groups across the globe.</p>

<p>As this is very much a project of passion, we are not terribly concerned about turning a profit on this game. The original plan was to use this game as a free proof of concept for the over all Cry of the Dead series. As such, fully funded or not, we will prevail and push forward. Funding just allows us to do so with a much closer deadline.</p>
<p>As a team, we realize that the biggest struggles throughout this process have come in three forms: lack of physical proximity, finicky engine, and art production speed. Realizing this, we decided to uproot all the work we’d done in RPGMaker VX and restart in Ace. This has led to much smoother maps and fewer headaches for our databaser and programming supervisor.</p>
<p>Part of the purpose of this campaign is to be able to buy our main artist’s time and gorgeous work on a salary--meaning they have more time to devote to our project instead of having to slave away at a regular job and only work for us on their off days. This will result in much faster development at the same quality.</p>
<p>We have also expressed concerns as a team about proper first nations representation in some of our effects art. Because of this, we brought in a magnificent Chipewan Dene artist to supplement in places that need an authentic hand.</p>
<p>Despite facing issues of three very different time zones, the team has been able to find ways to work smoothly together and bridge the zones. A large part of this comes from Zander’s history as a global newspaper Editor-in-Chief.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503447845/jdjlhnz9j1g9gsgr1es0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Zander Quinn is a transman with great aspirations and deeply running passions. Raised in the theatre (musical for the most part), there is a certain, calculated flair to his personality, even in stillness. Telling stories started as soon as he could speak, Zander excitedly leapt at the ability to write. He is a voracious reader and instinctive leader. Realizing that his passions lay in the stories themselves instead of a particular medium of telling, Zander created Jaded Phoenix Studios to find a truly multitalented team.</p> <p>Jade Twan is an enthusiastic, quirky RMT stationed in Canada. In addition to her love of natural healing and helping others, Jade has long held a passion for writing, art, and games. Separated from the culture of her first nations heritage by adoption and stigma, Jade's family tree stems from mixed carrier dene and English heritage. As such, she is conscientious and passionate about the culture, rights, and needs of indigenous peoples. After years of telling stories on her own, Jade has found a family with whom she can gleefully create.</p>
<p>Zack Valence is a British musician with a heart of gold and a penchant for helping others. In addition to the fantastic soundtracks and lyrical works he produces, Zack also enjoys a bit of writing, voice acting, and foley work now and then. He can play real instruments as well as manipulating sound files.</p>
<p>Shelbie ""KoniraThax"" Pilcher is a quiet agender from North Texas who has spent the last eight years pursuing a career in comics and other sequential arts. Do to their high enthusiasm for all things nerdy, they have always loved video games and has always dreamed of working with a strong but humble team of equally enthusiastic and diverse individuals.</p>

<p>""Many ages ago, Valkyir was carved from the cosmos by the Old Gods. Their breath became the air, their bodies became the earth, and their tears became the water. From their gifts, came life. Plants, animals and all sorts of wondrous creatures sprung forth unto the land. Before the Gods began their eternal slumber, they bestowed gifts unto the most precious of their creations.</p>
<p>Humankind were given courage, determination and intellect. Elfkind were given intimate knowledge of divine magics and taught to shepherd the souls of the departed. The Sheikh were bestowed with powerful mastery over the elements.</p>
<p>Once their energy had been fully spent on creation, the Gods slumbered, leaving their children in the hands of Njoror, God of the sea.</p>
<p>It is said, that the people of Mori were born from Njoror. Initially we were as fish, living entirely below the waves. Slowly we began venturing into the land where it was discovered that we could breathe the air.</p>
<p>Mother Earth welcomed the new comers and bestowed unto us knowledge of the elements and mana. Although the ocean is not prominently our home, we've retained the ability to breathe underwater. </p>
<p>Regular ceremonies are held to thank Njoror for his gifts and to praise Earth Mother for her wisdom.""</p>

<p><strong>Dacian (Day-Shan)</strong></p>
<p>Age: 24</p>
<p>Height: 6'4""</p>
<p>Class: Shadow Mage</p>
<p>Elements: Shadow, Electric.</p>
<p>""I just want to be myself.""</p>
<p>Bio: Adopted by the Blackfoot family. He was found wandering on the outskirts of the Ebon Glade, a cursed forest, when he was just a baby. Uncertain of his exact age or birthdate, the family celebrates his ""adopted day"" rather than a birthday. Many villagers believed him to be a bad omen, especially with the powers he possesses; but there are many that feel he's destined for greatness.</p>
<p>Typically keeps to himself. Spent the vast majority of his childhood with his adoptive brother Keith. The two quickly became synonymous with mischief, mainly due to Keith's clumsiness. Unable to breathe underwater like the other natives, he and Keith concocted several ideas and inventions in order to help Dacian breath underwater. Most of their attempts failed miserably; one attempt resulted in Dacian's near drowning and has instilled a deep fear of water that lingers to this day.</p>
<p>The son of the village elder, Mikasi (Mee-kah-see), and his group of friends have always been Dacian's main antagonists. In order to escape from them, when he's not working at the inn, Dacian enjoys visiting a nearby oasis that has always held a unique draw on him.</p> <p><strong>Keith Blackfoot</strong></p>
<p>Age: 24</p>
<p>Height: 6'2""</p>
<p>Class: Tribalist</p>
<p>Elements: Physical.</p>
<p>""I will protect her with my life.""</p>
<p>Bio: Headstrong and clumsy. Has always been very protective of his family and friends, and is quick to intervene if he sees anyone harassing Dacian. Disapproves of people that make quick judgments of people. Trained as a Tribalist from the time he was 11 and became one of the youngest teachers, mentoring other young Tribalists in the arts of the beast and blade. One of the main creators of the Totemic Beastial Aspect style that is now incorporated into Tribalist training.</p>
<p>Has a major weakness for sweets. If he's protective of family and Dacian, he's definitely over protective of his baby sister, Naomi.</p>
<p>Is the only one of the three siblings to have ventured far from Mori, typically on training missions or accompanying travelers safely across open territory. Deeply concerned by the amount of animals that have become increasingly aggressive over the years.</p> <p><strong>Naomi Blackfoot</strong></p>
<p>Age: 19</p>
<p>Height: 5'9""</p>
<p>Class: Mana Binder</p>
<p>Elements: Physical</p>
<p>""I don't understand, why all the fuss?""</p>
<p>Bio: Naive, pleasant and outgoing. Shed her youthful shyness in her mid teens, and is attempting to embrace the woman she's becoming. A talented Mana Binder and adept in combat, although there's not been much opportunity for her to prove herself with Keith getting in the way. Spent most of her days lazing around the underwater gardens with friends, or toiling away the evenings on the beach enjoying the sunset and the sound of the waves. Longs for adventure and to prove herself to be a strong and capable fighter in the eyes of her older brother.</p>
<p>Excitedly awaits the Ceremony of Mana which will mark her graduation from an adolescent to a woman, and regarded as an adult by their tribe. She's trained for this day for the last 5 years, working hard to hone her abilities.</p>

The winds have changed, and danger lurks on the horizon. Something has begun corrupting the minds and bodies of living creatures; and it's spreading rapidly.
In order to discover his true self, Dacian must learn to control himself and his temper, and tackle his inner demons.
Mori, located in the world of Valkyr (Val-kay-ear), is a sleepy village tucked into a seaside cove, protected from the ocean by a large barrier reef. Its beaches are a tourist hot spot, and tourism is their main economy. The natives that inhabit Mori follow the ways of their ancestors.

Realizing that his passions lay in the stories themselves instead of a particular medium of telling, Zander created Jaded Phoenix Studios to find a truly multitalented team. Jade Twan is an enthusiastic, quirky RMT stationed in Canada. In addition to her love of natural healing and helping others, Jade has long held a passion for writing, art, and games. Separated from the culture of her first nations heritage by adoption and stigma, Jade's family tree stems from mixed carrier dene and English heritage. As such, she is conscientious and passionate about the culture, rights, and needs of indigenous peoples. After years of telling stories on her own, Jade has found a family with whom she can gleefully create.

""Many ages ago, Valkyir was carved from the cosmos by the Old Gods. Their breath became the air, their bodies became the earth, and their tears became the water. From their gifts, came life. Plants, animals and all sorts of wondrous creatures sprung forth unto the land. Before the Gods began their eternal slumber, they bestowed gifts unto the most precious of their creations.
Humankind were given courage, determination and intellect. Elfkind were given intimate knowledge of divine magics and taught to shepherd the souls of the departed. The Sheikh were bestowed with powerful mastery over the elements.
Once their energy had been fully spent on creation, the Gods slumbered, leaving their children in the hands of Njoror, God of the sea.
It is said, that the people of Mori were born from Njoror. Initially we were as fish, living entirely below the waves. Slowly we began venturing into the land where it was discovered that we could breathe the air.
Mother Earth welcomed the new comers and bestowed unto us knowledge of the elements and mana. Although the ocean is not prominently our home, we've retained the ability to breathe underwater. 
Regular ceremonies are held to thank Njoror for his gifts and to praise Earth Mother for her wisdom.""
- Odakota Ravenwind

Dacian (Day-Shan)
Age: 24
Height: 6'4""
Class: Shadow Mage
Elements: Shadow, Electric.
""I just want to be myself.""
Bio: Adopted by the Blackfoot family. He was found wandering on the outskirts of the Ebon Glade, a cursed forest, when he was just a baby. Uncertain of his exact age or birthdate, the family celebrates his ""adopted day"" rather than a birthday. Many villagers believed him to be a bad omen, especially with the powers he possesses; but there are many that feel he's destined for greatness.
Typically keeps to himself. Spent the vast majority of his childhood with his adoptive brother Keith. The two quickly became synonymous with mischief, mainly due to Keith's clumsiness. Unable to breathe underwater like the other natives, he and Keith concocted several ideas and inventions in order to help Dacian breath underwater. Most of their attempts failed miserably; one attempt resulted in Dacian's near drowning and has instilled a deep fear of water that lingers to this day.
The son of the village elder, Mikasi (Mee-kah-see), and his group of friends have always been Dacian's main antagonists. In order to escape from them, when he's not working at the inn, Dacian enjoys visiting a nearby oasis that has always held a unique draw on him. Keith Blackfoot
Age: 24
Height: 6'2""
Class: Tribalist
Elements: Physical.
""I will protect her with my life.""
Bio: Headstrong and clumsy. Has always been very protective of his family and friends, and is quick to intervene if he sees anyone harassing Dacian. Disapproves of people that make quick judgments of people. Trained as a Tribalist from the time he was 11 and became one of the youngest teachers, mentoring other young Tribalists in the arts of the beast and blade. One of the main creators of the Totemic Beastial Aspect style that is now incorporated into Tribalist training.
Has a major weakness for sweets. If he's protective of family and Dacian, he's definitely over protective of his baby sister, Naomi.
Is the only one of the three siblings to have ventured far from Mori, typically on training missions or accompanying travelers safely across open territory. Deeply concerned by the amount of animals that have become increasingly aggressive over the years. Naomi Blackfoot
Age: 19
Height: 5'9""
Class: Mana Binder
Elements: Physical
""I don't understand, why all the fuss?""
Bio: Naive, pleasant and outgoing. Shed her youthful shyness in her mid teens, and is attempting to embrace the woman she's becoming. A talented Mana Binder and adept in combat, although there's not been much opportunity for her to prove herself with Keith getting in the way. Spent most of her days lazing around the underwater gardens with friends, or toiling away the evenings on the beach enjoying the sunset and the sound of the waves. Longs for adventure and to prove herself to be a strong and capable fighter in the eyes of her older brother.
Excitedly awaits the Ceremony of Mana which will mark her graduation from an adolescent to a woman, and regarded as an adult by their tribe. She's trained for this day for the last 5 years, working hard to hone her abilities.

This story takes place in medieval Japan where the former emperor is mysteriously murdered and an evil army commanded by Azai Hidesada prepares to take over the country. In this scenario, five teenagers enlist on a resistance army and start their journey for learning and becoming Samurais. They will need not only develop fighting skills but also spiritual power, political influence and become honored to be able to face their destinies.

<p>Above anything else, <strong>this game is about collecting</strong>! You start with an empty book of cards and can collect over 150 unique cards of different types (Heroes, Weapons, Armors, Potions, Magic, Materials and Recipes). Some of the cards will require a special talent or ability in order to be revealed. You will be fascinated by their special powers and abilities.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>this game is about discovery!</strong> A whole new world lies unrevealed. The game's map starts in medieval Japan, (new DLCs can be developed to expand worldwide) which is all unrevealed to players. As you advance through the ancient villages and resolve their challenges, you will advance on the map (Civilization style).  </p>
<p>Also, <strong>this game is about strategy</strong>! The game's story is not linear. Like many RPG Games you can make your choices and the story will change accordingly. There are 5 main characters and each one has a different background and ability.</p>
<p>Not least important, this is not a traditional card game that only copies Magic the Gathering. This game has its original battle system, which relies more on your strategy than on your luck.</p>
<p>Finally,<strong> this game is about having fun!</strong> It's a collaborative single player and turn based game. What does that mean? It means you can a play as single player as much as you want, but if you would like to join other players around the globe, you can count on them to achieve bigger challenges.  Also, in this sense, we will count on the game's community ideas and suggestions to make this game better at every version.</p>

The Samurai Forge game is based on a book by the same author (not released to the general public yet). This story takes place in medieval Japan where the former emperor is mysteriously murdered and an evil army commanded by Azai Hidesada prepares to take over the country. In this scenario, five teenagers enlist on a resistance army and start their journey for learning and becoming Samurais. They will need not only develop fighting skills but also spiritual power, political influence and become honored to be able to face their destinies. Samurai Forge has some historical background mixed with a lot of fantasy emerging the player into a world of wonders.  



Ichiro, son of a famous blacksmith named Amakuni, is a strong boy, full of energy, who spends most of his time working with his father at the forge. Ichiro dreams of replacing his father after his death and finding out what happened to his mother, whom he never met.


Manami was raised by her grandfather, a respected retired samurai. She loves to take care of people and animals. She is very skilled in making and using potions.


Yuta is the tallest of them, son of farmers, jokester, a spirited boy, who has always drawn everyone’s attention. He is a fast runner and makes quick attacks with knives, his favorite weapons. His energy seems endless.


Son of a merchant, Kazuki has no intention to keep the business. He is as big as his father and takes advantage of that to pick fights. He has no other dream but becoming a famous samurai desired by women.


Itaru is a thin, good-looking boy with whom all girls in the village fall in love. Although he was not looking for love, he was looking for revenge on the murderer of his oldest brother. Training hard and dedication is his motto.

 

In Samurai Forge you will find 6 types of cards: Warriors, Accessories (armors, weapons and shields), Potions, Magic, Recipes (ex: recipe to forge a simple shield) and Materials (ex: wood, iron, silk, leather).

All cards have a rarity classification according to the easiness of collecting them:

 

Every warrior has an amount of honor, the higher the card's honor is, the more difficult it becomes to have it under your command. 
Warriors have 6 levels of chakra, and only through the forging practice can you advance your cards' chakra level.

Warriors have one of the four races: Human, Creature, Semi-God and Semi-Demon, a name and gender.

Warriors can be born with special abilities or can acquire them by elevating their chakra level.

Some warriors can wear accessories to improve their performance. 

 

Accessories can be collected or forged during the game. There are three categories of accessories: Armors,Weapons and Shields. Only warriors are able to wear accessories and improve their fighting performance in different ways.
 

Potions can be a very useful resource in battles. There are several types of potions that can help you to build a strong strategy against your enemies. You can also make your own potions in advanced levels.
 

Magic when used wisely can turn a lost battle into victory. Magic can affect one or more cards. Some have collateral effects, others don't.  
 

Recipes are cards that will teach you how to forge equipment or teach you what ingredients to mix in order to make a potion. Recipes are not used in battles.
 

Materials are useful resources used to forge weapons, armor, level-up warriors' chakra, make potions and magic.

We have made a list of the major reasons for that:

It is a Fixed Goal campaign. If we do not achieve our goal this game will not be released (lack of interested people) :(  so sad!
You can get exclusive prizes that will not be offered any place else.

<p>Esports is getting bigger and bigger. In countries like Sweden, Germany, the USA and of course South Korea, esports has a firm position in the life of its peoples. Unfortunately, this is not the case in the Benelux, but we would like to change that! How? By creating a place where esports enthusiasts and athletes of all skill levels, casual, professional or somewhere in between, can come together and celebrate the passion that is esports. A place to use top notch gaming PC's and consoles, participate in tournaments, watch streams and events live on our big TV-screens and attend gaming events and parties organized by us. But above all, a place where you can meet friends or make new ones. You already have one thing in common: everyone at EsportsDome loves esports!</p>
<p>So why do we need you then? Well, unfortunately our dream costs quite a bit of money.. We can only do so much ourselves. We have excellent connections and possibilities with multiple sponsors. However, sponsors want to know the reach of a project before they decide to invest. This is where you come in! With your help we can show them and everyone else that needs to see it that esports has a place in the Benelux far bigger than it is now, and that EsportsDome can be a huge part of the esports community.</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Oh we do, mr. Troll!</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our costs comprise of three parts:</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Monthly expenses: Just like every other business, EsportsDome will have monthly expenses. These include things like rent, electricity, water and of course a superb internet connection. These expenses will be covered by sponsors, subsidies and generated income.</span><br/></p>
<p>Events expenses: For all the awesome events we are going to host at EsportsDome we need funds too. Think about costs like tournament prizes, hiring pro esports athletes to give masterclasses, or extra staff if we expect a lot of people to turn up at a big event. These expenses will be covered by sponsors and generated income.</p>
<p>One-time investment: When you start something as big as EsportsDome, it will require a large one-time investment to set everything up so you can actually start doing the things you want to do. Examples of these are the PC's and consoles, comfy chairs for everyone to sit on, and even bar supplies like a coffee machine or plates and cutlery. Most of these items can be sponsored, but not all. The items that can't be covered by sponsor deals, estimated to be around €25.000,-, we want to cover by the funds gathered by this crowdfunding campaign.</p>

<p>Of course, being almost a year away from our proposed starting date, things can go wrong. We do not intend to, but they can. We have done our share of market research, have spoken to a lot of sponsors and investors, have made countless updates on our estimates and we're certain that we are close to what the actual numbers are going to be. But, as you all know, life doesn't always go the way you want it to go. If we do not make the campaign goal, we cannot start EsportsDome. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">In that case, you won't have paid anything to us since we use a fixed goal, but unfortunately that also means we cannot provide the perks you have backed us for. If we do make the campaign goal but for some reason still cannot open our doors, as long as you didn't receive your perk yet, you are entitled to ask for a refund, which we will grant. </span></p>
</div></div>","Hello everyone! We are Ruben Been and Marcel Opperman, two very dedicated esports fanatics with a dream. Since the moment we both learned about esports, we've had the dream to work in this amazing branche full-time. Now we're trying to make this dream come true and create a place, or better yet, a paradise for all esports enthusiasts, a place called EsportsDome!



In this section we will:

Briefly describe our campaign


Explain why we need you to help us achieve our dream

Introduce ourselves further
Tell you about our finances
Show you our stretch goals and perks
Sum up the risks and challenges




Esports is getting bigger and bigger. In countries like Sweden, Germany, the USA and of course South Korea, esports has a firm position in the life of its peoples. Unfortunately, this is not the case in the Benelux, but we would like to change that! How? By creating a place where esports enthusiasts and athletes of all skill levels, casual, professional or somewhere in between, can come together and celebrate the passion that is esports. A place to use top notch gaming PC's and consoles, participate in tournaments, watch streams and events live on our big TV-screens and attend gaming events and parties organized by us. But above all, a place where you can meet friends or make new ones. You already have one thing in common: everyone at EsportsDome loves esports!
So why do we need you then? Well, unfortunately our dream costs quite a bit of money.. We can only do so much ourselves. We have excellent connections and possibilities with multiple sponsors. However, sponsors want to know the reach of a project before they decide to invest. This is where you come in! With your help we can show them and everyone else that needs to see it that esports has a place in the Benelux far bigger than it is now, and that EsportsDome can be a huge part of the esports community.



The proposed location of EsportsDome is in the heart of Breda (the Netherlands), at just 10 minutes walking distance from the central trainstation. Below we will show you what we have in mind when it comes to the EsportsDome venue. None of this is permanent and the arrangement might be subject to change, The green part in the middle is a patio (f.e. to take a smoke).
Entrance / shop:The entrance will function as both storefront and shop. Here, diverse EsportsDome merchandise will be for sale, as well as products from our sponsors.
Console area:With at least 16 consoles, the console gamers amongst us will have plenty to do in EsportsDome. Play games such as FIFA, one of the popular fighting games or join one of our tournaments and other activities.
Stream lounge:Of course you can watch DreamHack, ESL and LCS from the comfort of your home, but isn’t it better to watch with other enthusiasts on big screens? In the Stream Lounge in EsportsDome all major national and international tournaments will be broadcast. Have a drink with you friends, and cheer for your teams and players!

PC area:There will be between 40 and 50 high-end gaming PCs in EsportsDome. Visitors can rent these PC's, but of course we will also use them for tournaments, workshops, LAN-parties and many other awesome activities. The PCs will have most popular games pre-installed and are ready to go!Also the bar is located in the PC area to make sure you won't get dehydrated or starved.
To be decided area:Last but not least, there is one area with no determined function. We’ve placed couches and consoles on the sketch, but what would you like to see here? After the crowdfunding campaign, we will join the community in a brainstorm session what the best use of the space will be. The community will decide on the best idea, and we will make sure this is implemented!


It's our pleasure to introduce ourselves to you and tell you about who we are and what we have done in esports and management.

First things first: We are not paying ourselves wages until EsportsDome opens in summer 2017. We pay our own costs with savings we have gathered over the last years, while planning ahead for this campaign. Now, it is time to fulfill our dream.


Oh we do, mr. Troll!
Our costs comprise of three parts:
Monthly expenses: Just like every other business, EsportsDome will have monthly expenses. These include things like rent, electricity, water and of course a superb internet connection. These expenses will be covered by sponsors, subsidies and generated income.
Events expenses: For all the awesome events we are going to host at EsportsDome we need funds too. Think about costs like tournament prizes, hiring pro esports athletes to give masterclasses, or extra staff if we expect a lot of people to turn up at a big event. These expenses will be covered by sponsors and generated income.
One-time investment: When you start something as big as EsportsDome, it will require a large one-time investment to set everything up so you can actually start doing the things you want to do. Examples of these are the PC's and consoles, comfy chairs for everyone to sit on, and even bar supplies like a coffee machine or plates and cutlery. Most of these items can be sponsored, but not all. The items that can't be covered by sponsor deals, estimated to be around €25.000,-, we want to cover by the funds gathered by this crowdfunding campaign.


Now, if this campaign turns out to be very successful and we exceed the goal amount by a large number, we will flow that money right back to you through our stretch goals. How? By lowering our entry fees, which is explained below.

We are very excited about this project, and hopefully you are too. If you are, then please help us with backing, sharing this campaign and our Facebook, or even better: both! You can share the campaign by clicking the buttons on the top right of this page. If you have any questions about the campaign and/or EsportsDome, do not hesitate to contact us. You can do this by clicking the button 'ask a question', or e-mail us on info@esportsdome.nl. We will answer you as soon as we possibly can.  




Of course, being almost a year away from our proposed starting date, things can go wrong. We do not intend to, but they can. We have done our share of market research, have spoken to a lot of sponsors and investors, have made countless updates on our estimates and we're certain that we are close to what the actual numbers are going to be. But, as you all know, life doesn't always go the way you want it to go. If we do not make the campaign goal, we cannot start EsportsDome. In that case, you won't have paid anything to us since we use a fixed goal, but unfortunately that also means we cannot provide the perks you have backed us for. If we do make the campaign goal but for some reason still cannot open our doors, as long as you didn't receive your perk yet, you are entitled to ask for a refund, which we will grant.",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><h3>About Growth Hacker</h3> <p></p>
<p>As part of Global Startup Battle 2015, we're making a board game about startups! Growth Hacker is a cheeky game about getting your startup off the ground and growing it to the Uber of whatever industry you're in. It's a turn based board, dice, and card game combining elements of turn based and strategic role playing games. </p>
<p>In Growth Hacker, you employ staff, acquire users, and collect revenue to build your startup over 7 years. But you’ll get hit by market crashes, disruption cards, sneaky competitors, and the dreaded IPO!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Sneaky Preview!</h3>
<div>The rules are already fully drafted, and this weekend we are developing a prototype! Here are some quick examples of the rules and cards. There's more examples being added to the <b><i>Updates</i></b> section regularly.</div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<h3></h3>
<p><span>CAPITAL RAISING RULE </span></p>
<p>In a capital raise, you sell a portion of your company in exchange for money. To start a capital raise, declare that you are performing a capital raise, the percentage of your company that you’re selling, and your valuation.</p>
<p>For example, you might sell 10% of your company, for 50 bitcoins. Or you might sell 60% of the company for 300 bitcoins. Both of these value the company at 500 bitcoins. You can use any valuation you like, and don’t need to justify it to other players (it doesn’t need to be related to the valuation method used to choose a winner, if you don’t want it to be).</p>
<p>You need to get at least half of the other players to agree to the valuation for it to go ahead. So for example, if there are 4 people playing, then 2 other players need to agree to your valuation. If your valuation is accepted, then your capital raise goes ahead. On your turn in the next phase, take the amount of money agreed on before doing anything else. You also immediately update your percentage ownership.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span>STANDING DESK CARD<br/>Hustlers bring in an extra user per phase for each standing desk you own. (Keep - costs 15 bitcoin).</span></p></li>
</ul></div>

<p></p>
<h3>KPIs (lol)!</h3> </div> <div> <p>So turns out unless you're printing thousands of them, boardgames aren't all that cheap to make!</p> <ul> <li>We've contacted suppliers and have worked out we'll need around $40 AUD to make each game to a solid standard (so considerably better than our usual Officeworks printing).</li> <li>Our main perk is a copy of the game for $50 AUD - but there are stacks of others to the right so check them out!</li> <li>This is a fixed funding campaign, so if we don't make the goal *screams* then everyone gets their dollarydoos back and we'll have to pivot slightly.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why the world needs this</h3> <p>Board games are broken. Kidding! But actually, there should be an awesome one about startups - and what better place to see it happen than at a Startup Weekend. There is an increasing market for tabletop games, and there are over 400K people who have attended a startup weekend before - so we're hoping people will be pretty keen!</p>
<p>We've made a few games before, like a lifesized Settlers of Catan for our hexagonal IKEA rug, and a libertarian rip off of CAH titled Cards Against Communism. So we're very excited about taking on an original project of our own! (See the video for what these looked like. They were pretty sick.)</p>

Sneaky Preview!

STANDING DESK CARDHustlers bring in an extra user per phase for each standing desk you own. (Keep - costs 15 bitcoin).



KPIs (lol)!   So turns out unless you're printing thousands of them, boardgames aren't all that cheap to make!  We've contacted suppliers and have worked out we'll need around $40 AUD to make each game to a solid standard (so considerably better than our usual Officeworks printing). Our main perk is a copy of the game for $50 AUD - but there are stacks of others to the right so check them out! This is a fixed funding campaign, so if we don't make the goal *screams* then everyone gets their dollarydoos back and we'll have to pivot slightly.

<div> <h3>FAQs</h3>
<div> </div>
<p><b>Why is Magik Play not compatible with other tablets (Android and Surface)?</b></p>
<p>Our technology is dependent on the tablet screen and hardware sensors. We know the technology works on other tablets, we tested it, but it requires effort from our side, supporting a range of devices and adapting the software to different hardware specifications. So we started on iPads and will get to your device soon !</p>
<p><b>The Magik Blocks will work on future games?</b></p>
<p>With your help we will keep developing games that uses these set of blocks. In future we also expect that we add other blocks for other themes and games.</p>
<p><b>Can the wooden blocks scratch the screen?</b></p>
<p>The wooden blocks are smooth and safe to use on your iPad screen. If you are still not convinced, you can use your normal screen protector and it will work fine.</p>
<p><b><b>Does it work with my iPad mini?</b></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes. The wooden blocks may look big for the smaller screen but they work because we are going to adapt the levels to that screen size.</p>
<p><b>Are the materials safe for kids?</b></p>
<p>We have strong concerns about kids safety and we are making sure only safe materials and non-toxic paints are used. We are also following all the current legislation to this kind of toys/games and part of the funds from this crowdfunding campaign is to support all necessary tests and compliances regarding toy safety.  </p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Can a 2 year old toddler play the games?</b></p>
<p>In spite of the age recommendation, will make sure the Magik blocks are perfectly safe for younger kids. Kids below 3 can play the game, but they maybe will need an adult help to guide them in each level.</p>
<p><b>If I loose a Magik Block is possible to get a replacement ?</b></p>
<p>In the future we will have on our website the option to buy spare parts, so that you don´t have to buy an entire kit if you loose only a couple of pieces.</p>

For the first time kids can play with real wooden toys on the iPad™
     When kids play, they create their own world. In there, there are no limits to what is real, what hides behind the screen or what can be brought to life. We too dream with that world !  With a little Magik, we brought together the physical and digital play.   As Featured in:  They are all talking about Magik Play as an innovative set of educational games that merge the power of the digital interaction with the simplicity and fun of traditional toys. 
Magik Play challenges kid to get through each challenge by assembling the magik blocks and the games respond to the physical constructions ! 

 
 
So far we have three Magik Play games designed to promote motor skills, spatial reasoning, creativity and collaboration.
These games are adapted to different age needs and interests:

 
 

To kids from 3 to 5 years: simple games that reinforce the importance of identifying basic shapes on the screen, using the physical wooden blocks.  
 
 

To kids from 4 to 6 years:  amazing challenges that requires children to build objects with real wooden blocks to complete challenges on each level. 
 
 

 
To kids above 5 years old: even more challenging levels that require collaboration to complete the assignments and help the characters to escape.
 
 
Magik Play kit will include:

access to the 3 apps above (Hidden shape, Dino blocks and Runaway)
a kit of wooden Magik blocks
an Universal iPad™ stand 


 
 
 
 

 
After Indiegogo campaign finishes, we estimate Magik Play will sell on retail for $49.90
 
 
Reasons why you should have Magik Play

                                               
Easy to setup and always ready to play, no batteries, wires or internet connection, all you need is in the package... 
 
 
 


 
... well all, except the iPad™ :) 
In the end all stores back into the same box, easy and quick ! 
 
 
  
                                               
This simple interaction is possible, because we developed a great solution that does not need batteries, wires or internet connection. It simply communicates with the iPad™, we call it “our little magik secret”.
 
 
 
  
The coolness behind Magik Play is that it's very intuitive and simple to play.
 

 
 
                                               
 
 
We strong believe that the combination of physical toys with the advantages of the digital technology, brings major benefits to the kids development.
Exploratory work has suggested that this sort of tangible interfaces might be particularly suitable for engaging children in playful learning and that the link between physical action and digital effects might lead to increased engagement and reflection.

Unlikely combination ? maybe... but one that works extremely well !  
 
 
We are a team of parents and university researchers, involved in several award winning projects and with a strong experience on interactive technology for education.

 





 

Our product experts are the reason why we are doing this project. They are our inspiration, but also our greatest critics. Our games are only ready to go If they pass their extensive tests.

Risks and challenges
 
As with any physical product, there are a huge number of tasks that need to be completed. However, we have the necessary experience to take it to the finish line.
 
Our commitment to our backers is to be transparent all the way to the final delivery. We know that regular communication is key, in goods or bads moments.
The technologies used are fully developed at this point, and it works.
The final iPad stand may have some design variations to allow the necessary compatibility with most of the iPad designs and to adjust the production to a higher scale. 

Please be aware when we start shipping Magik Play there's always a risk of the product getting delayed in customs. 
We are going to do everything in our power the fullfill your expectations. 
We have a mission to complete, and therefore we are going to put blood, sweat and tears to make it happen !
We will provide regular updates, and you can always follow our progress on facebook or twitter.

<br/><p>All vehicles are potentially usable. We want vehicles to really have a meaning. They won't be hard to come by, but you might have a problem getting any of them to run. We have planned and implemented an extensive parts list for anything on wheels. Vehicles can also be used as mobile camps carrying all of your goods in their trunks or truck beds. Leaving your fully-stocked car in the wild, unlocked, would be a terrible idea. Removing a part or two should keep it pretty safe. So you found a nice pile of old barn wood? That'd be great to use when boarding up all those doors and windows back home. You can't stick ten planks into a backpack, right? But you can fit plenty into the bed of a truck or the trunk of a car. Vehicles will be worth their weight in gold in our world so make sure that you take care of yours.</p>

<p>One of the key notes of every successful game is the music and we work tirelessly to bring you the best heart pumping experience. Each and every sound and every melody was selected carefully to match the game's scenes and occurrences, while having a unique touch of our own.

</div><p>The Reich’s has a Eugenics Program to cleanse a certain ethnic group from Earth. Russia wants to experiment on the ideas of Genetic Supremacism and starts a similar secret program. Through the spying they know both are working on a virus that they want to be Genpool specific, so they can wipe each other out easily and without using force and wasting time and resources. They steal each other’s Scientific Research and Virus sample and both create a combined Version. The RUSH Virus. Germany can’t handle it and virus breaks free in laboratory, one infected scientists makes it out alive and goes to Russia Laboratory’s. He tells them to stop because at his laboratory all people were killed. They say they don’t believe them and they can’t die because it’s Gen specific. The Russians don’t believe the German scientist and as the guards go to him to take him captive, the German scientist starts coughing and sneezing sending virus particles in the air before his untimely death. The Russian laboratory gets infected and within 48 hours the virus wiped them out completely. On a broader scale both the Russians and the Germans are forced to do something about that. Because it is clear that it doesn’t target not only the Germans or only the Russians but all people. That forces them to cooperate to keep this secret from the other countries of the coalition because Russia can’t afford to look weak and so cant Germany at this point in the war. So they make a pact to remove everything related to the project and ship all infected to an Island chain far in the Ocean where hopefully no one would notice. They plan to work on a vaccine but so far all they have found is a substance that slows the process down. So in the end everyone who is infected dies. </p>The Americans find out about the Virus and tells both the Russians and Germans that they know. Out of this situation it becomes clear that this Virus could be a threat to the United States and the whole world if not controlled. So after discussing it with Germany and Russia they decide to help with the shipping because they have the biggest Navy on planet Earth. The deal is that Russia and Germany take care of resources used to build facilities and infrastructure on the Island and America ships the infected and keeps the island chained and under protection so that no one can escape or enter. First, it was an organized system but after shipping the last infected to the islands, no one wanted to waste further resources so they agreed to abandon it and leave the people as they are. From time to time they would fly in supplies for the survivors and even some virus inhibitors and they were leaving all there stashes behind because they wanted to get out of there as fast as possible so that no evidence would give them up.<p></p><div>
<p>In exchange for big sums of money from Russia and Germany, the US is keeping this issue under wraps and even sending supplies every so often that the people may survive in the harsh condition but all of the islands are surrounded and abandoned. To this day the island chains are surrounded and supplies and virus inhibitors are dropped from the air to support survivors. No one gets in or out but the chance to heal yourself and having a normal life without dying rapidly and horribly exists. So that is what people are trying to learn while walking the path of the damned on Rush Island. </p>
<p>Christopher Miller – Hero of the Island – Abandoned by America, had to stay back (Plot) – Miller has friends on outside who send supplies, but they can’t go back for him or let him out. He was infected from some traitors - He has become the leader and symbol of freedom and healthiness - People got together and pulled statues down – Miller is the symbol of the island and both side praise the “M” Symbol for Miller.</p>

<p>PLOT IDEA On the Islands are oil extraction machines that pump oil to the surface. Implement the greediness of Americans for oil, even as early as WWII, in the story. They gathered surveillance everywhere, that’s why they know of the plan from Germany and Russia. They are also researching places for oil refineries and they had the islands under surveillance. That’s one piece of how they discovered the plot and why they want big sums of money (see main story). The Americans only interest with the islands is the oil. Miller has a conflict with a greedy asshole that doesn’t give a shit about people. He is against the oil and the use of sick labors. The bad guy is responsible to frame him in bad light, but Miller proves over time, after he is trapped and contacts outside, that he is not. That’s why he has still friends outside even though some are paid off and learned to hate Miller for the money. In exchange for supply drops, Miller opens the oil lines that where build and lead into the ocean. They open the floodgates as trade off. But they demand items in addition to food and basic necessities. They work on their own condition even though they are trapped, they now have made this deal for a better future and life for all. (Game loot and Item variety) Also it makes sense as reason why both tribes have a period of peace and live in harmony on the island. In this harmony period they even strike down statues to honor this change of their lives. After Miller dies both tribes remember Millers story but they start fighting over supply drops and when there was the first incident about the supply drops they started splitting up and fighting over resources so they can have the loot basically said. Both Islands fight to honor Miller that’s why both use the M, maybe slightly different versions but practically the exact same. So they have a time period after the split where there is much death and fighting over stuff, island architecture including all items becomes makeshift style, overgrown, used, worn down, apocalyptic, WWII + Nature + Makeshift and only from time to time airdrops with modern stuff and clean stuff. Clothing also worn down over time, maybe they invented method to make cloth and harvest foods and stuff like that, would be cool or even different hierarchy systems in both tribes, something creative. Both have their own developed gadgets because every side has something the other wants, and they steal from each other and play mind games to get the resources the other tribe.</p>

</div><p></p></div>","All vehicles are potentially usable. We want vehicles to really have a meaning. They won't be hard to come by, but you might have a problem getting any of them to run. We have planned and implemented an extensive parts list for anything on wheels. Vehicles can also be used as mobile camps carrying all of your goods in their trunks or truck beds. Leaving your fully-stocked car in the wild, unlocked, would be a terrible idea. Removing a part or two should keep it pretty safe. So you found a nice pile of old barn wood? That'd be great to use when boarding up all those doors and windows back home. You can't stick ten planks into a backpack, right? But you can fit plenty into the bed of a truck or the trunk of a car. Vehicles will be worth their weight in gold in our world so make sure that you take care of yours.
(1) All vehicles can be repaired or modified  
(2) All vehicles are fuel based and require fuel to function
(3) Vehicles also require numerous parts to function


 
One of the key notes of every successful game is the music and we work tirelessly to bring you the best heart pumping experience. Each and every sound and every melody was selected carefully to match the game's scenes and occurrences, while having a unique touch of our own. Whether you are wandering among the damned or just exploring the vast wilderness of the islands. In addition we have a treat for you, the shattering guitar sounds of our awesome band ""The Genders"" will be played while you are working your way to the cure, fighting formidable foes and making yourselves a symbol as the legends that you are.




  
 Rush Island is full of wonder , diverse environments, animals and plants. This gives a sense that this small island is in fact a world inside of a world, a microcosms of our blue planet for us to travel and explore and with each and every mission the appetite to know more, to see what else is out there will gradually grow inside you until there will be no escape. Here's is a taste of what is to come



























  
 As you probably already know making this kind of an ambitious game requires a substantial amount of capital. Games like this often have hundreds of thousands of dollars invested. That goes to: developers, animators, sound engineers, software engineers, etc. However, we have achieved much with little to none. Our team is all invested in it with great passion and belief as a fuel and we have a plan to make it all work but we need your help.
 

This chart below provides the answer for the question first posed in the title and as you can see, already thirty percent of the relatively small budget already goes to taxes, but even so we calculated allocated the funds exactly where it needs to go.    

The Reich’s has a Eugenics Program to cleanse a certain ethnic group from Earth. Russia wants to experiment on the ideas of Genetic Supremacism and starts a similar secret program. Through the spying they know both are working on a virus that they want to be Genpool specific, so they can wipe each other out easily and without using force and wasting time and resources. They steal each other’s Scientific Research and Virus sample and both create a combined Version. The RUSH Virus. Germany can’t handle it and virus breaks free in laboratory, one infected scientists makes it out alive and goes to Russia Laboratory’s. He tells them to stop because at his laboratory all people were killed. They say they don’t believe them and they can’t die because it’s Gen specific. The Russians don’t believe the German scientist and as the guards go to him to take him captive, the German scientist starts coughing and sneezing sending virus particles in the air before his untimely death. The Russian laboratory gets infected and within 48 hours the virus wiped them out completely. On a broader scale both the Russians and the Germans are forced to do something about that. Because it is clear that it doesn’t target not only the Germans or only the Russians but all people. That forces them to cooperate to keep this secret from the other countries of the coalition because Russia can’t afford to look weak and so cant Germany at this point in the war. So they make a pact to remove everything related to the project and ship all infected to an Island chain far in the Ocean where hopefully no one would notice. They plan to work on a vaccine but so far all they have found is a substance that slows the process down. So in the end everyone who is infected dies. The Americans find out about the Virus and tells both the Russians and Germans that they know. Out of this situation it becomes clear that this Virus could be a threat to the United States and the whole world if not controlled. So after discussing it with Germany and Russia they decide to help with the shipping because they have the biggest Navy on planet Earth. The deal is that Russia and Germany take care of resources used to build facilities and infrastructure on the Island and America ships the infected and keeps the island chained and under protection so that no one can escape or enter. First, it was an organized system but after shipping the last infected to the islands, no one wanted to waste further resources so they agreed to abandon it and leave the people as they are. From time to time they would fly in supplies for the survivors and even some virus inhibitors and they were leaving all there stashes behind because they wanted to get out of there as fast as possible so that no evidence would give them up.
In exchange for big sums of money from Russia and Germany, the US is keeping this issue under wraps and even sending supplies every so often that the people may survive in the harsh condition but all of the islands are surrounded and abandoned. To this day the island chains are surrounded and supplies and virus inhibitors are dropped from the air to support survivors. No one gets in or out but the chance to heal yourself and having a normal life without dying rapidly and horribly exists. So that is what people are trying to learn while walking the path of the damned on Rush Island. 
Christopher Miller – Hero of the Island – Abandoned by America, had to stay back (Plot) – Miller has friends on outside who send supplies, but they can’t go back for him or let him out. He was infected from some traitors - He has become the leader and symbol of freedom and healthiness - People got together and pulled statues down – Miller is the symbol of the island and both side praise the “M” Symbol for Miller.


PLOT IDEA On the Islands are oil extraction machines that pump oil to the surface. Implement the greediness of Americans for oil, even as early as WWII, in the story. They gathered surveillance everywhere, that’s why they know of the plan from Germany and Russia. They are also researching places for oil refineries and they had the islands under surveillance. That’s one piece of how they discovered the plot and why they want big sums of money (see main story). The Americans only interest with the islands is the oil. Miller has a conflict with a greedy asshole that doesn’t give a shit about people. He is against the oil and the use of sick labors. The bad guy is responsible to frame him in bad light, but Miller proves over time, after he is trapped and contacts outside, that he is not. That’s why he has still friends outside even though some are paid off and learned to hate Miller for the money. In exchange for supply drops, Miller opens the oil lines that where build and lead into the ocean. They open the floodgates as trade off. But they demand items in addition to food and basic necessities. They work on their own condition even though they are trapped, they now have made this deal for a better future and life for all. (Game loot and Item variety) Also it makes sense as reason why both tribes have a period of peace and live in harmony on the island. In this harmony period they even strike down statues to honor this change of their lives. After Miller dies both tribes remember Millers story but they start fighting over supply drops and when there was the first incident about the supply drops they started splitting up and fighting over resources so they can have the loot basically said. Both Islands fight to honor Miller that’s why both use the M, maybe slightly different versions but practically the exact same. So they have a time period after the split where there is much death and fighting over stuff, island architecture including all items becomes makeshift style, overgrown, used, worn down, apocalyptic, WWII + Nature + Makeshift and only from time to time airdrops with modern stuff and clean stuff. Clothing also worn down over time, maybe they invented method to make cloth and harvest foods and stuff like that, would be cool or even different hierarchy systems in both tribes, something creative. Both have their own developed gadgets because every side has something the other wants, and they steal from each other and play mind games to get the resources the other tribe.
MILLERS WIFE She is a Scientist and is eventually working with oil minerals and fungus (see Main story). That’s why she can help synthesize an anti-virus inhibitor drug.

At the “M”, the lines that goes up from the middle could be hands and in the middle we add a block or redesigned so the lines represents hands and a standing person, the block between them represent the airdrop. He is standing, looking up at the airdrop, camera behind him a few feet and sun is casting the shadow in M form and combined with his gesture he makes the Logo and the airdrop in the air in front of him with a parachute. This is a early version for preview.

The islands are filled with dangers, lurking in every corner, waiting to put an end to a life of service and dedication. In order to protect yourselves and continue the fight there are a wide range of weapons to choose from. From guns and knives to mean howling war machine vehicles and machine guns. The weapons vary with the residents of the island: Russian, American, and German made. There is an option to have custom made weapon. Find the parts you need and build your very own killer tools of war.",51.0,4,"1 Campaign

		We started to develop H2o over a year ago, after leaving our studies or our jobs in order to work full time on the game.
		<br/>
<br/>
		We have managed to reach an advanced stage of development on our own without over-spending money but, now, we need your help to finalise all the work and release the game as it should be.
		<br/>
<br/>
		Our primary goal of 8500 $ (~ 7500 €) may appear to be rather low for such an ambitious project like H2o, but we don't want to ask for more than we really need to complete the work.
		<br/>
		We need it for the <b>software license fees</b>, the <b>official servers rental</b> and <b>various administrative costs</b>.
		<br/>
<br/>
		Having said that ,with more financial support we might be able to expand the development team and thus increase our efficiency,  and bring the game so much further.

				We know that piloting a flying vehicle can be quite hard and that crashing a plane on its first flight after spending much time to build it can be frustrating. But, with aircrafts that can land on water the crash risk is minimised: you can land anywhere, takeoff anywhere, even if you run out of fuel during a flight, you will just glide down to touch the surface of the sea.

		The game will be available on <b>Pc</b>, <b>Mac</b> and <b>Linux</b>.
		<br/>
<br/>
		The <b>servers</b> are designed for up to <b>80 players</b> and will likely be on <b>Linux</b>, unless something unexpected happens during the next months.

<br/>
		The <b>minimum configuration</b> required to run H2o isn't defined yet, this will be determined during the <b>closed alpha</b> phase.
		<br/>
		Nevertheless, the <b>option menu</b> is already up and running so the graphical settings can be edited. With the lowest graphics, the game should work fine on most current Pc.

		As you can see in the screenshot above, there are three types of <b>zones</b>, if you don't consider the underwater space.
		<br/>
<br/>
		- <b>Clear zones</b>:
		<br/>
		Large areas generally free of obstacles. To maneuver a ship in those places is quite easy but there is <b>no cover</b>. You may often find an <b>oil platform</b> in the center.
		<br/>
<br/>
		- <b>Canyon zones</b>:
		<br/>
		Narrow areas which look like mazes. This is the best place to <b>build your home</b>. Hidden by the cliffs, a fortress is much easier to <b>defend</b>.
		<br/>
		( You know, bottleneck principle! )
		<br/>
<br/>
		- <b>Flooded cities</b>:
		<br/>
		Places where the <b>resources</b> are the most abundant. Cities are very <b>dangerous</b> places, even though you can easily hide in a building. Many players will collect resources there.
		<br/>

<b>Fuel is power.</b>
<br/>
		The more you will upgrade your technologic tier the more you will need it.
		<br/>
<br/>
		To use some <b>vehicles</b> but also to feed <b>gensets</b> in your base or to reload a <b>flamethrower turret</b>... Some advanced crafts require fuel too (like <b>rockets</b>, for example).
		<br/>
<br/>
<b>So, how to get it?</b>

		There are three <b>oil platforms</b> in the flooded land.
		<br/>
		But <b>only one</b> of these platforms will be active at a time, and sometimes not even one...
		<br/>
<br/>
		You will quickly realize that there is a real ""<b>Fuel War</b>"" because everyone needs it and everyone knows that depriving someone of it will weaken him.

		This system aims to <b>balance</b> the access to this resource, to avoid that a powerful team controls all the supply.<br/>

		Even if it's not an obligation, <b>Making friends</b> is very important in H2o.
		<br/>
		The clan system is here to help you with that.
		<br/>
<br/>
		It works pretty much like the ""guilds"" in some very famous MMORPG.
		<br/>
		When you want to form a clan with your friends, you simply <b>invite</b> them to join you. You give a name to your clan, you manage the <b>rights</b> of each members, etc.

<br/>
		There are many <b>weapons</b> at your disposal in H2o: from the <b>harpoon</b> to the <b>rocket launcher</b>, passing by the <b>nail gun</b>.

		<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>But your arsenal doesn't stop there!</b>
<br/>
<br/>
		Some vehicles (especially the <b>big ones</b>) have <b>turret supports</b>.
		<br/>
<br/>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1332467/files/20150327191224-quote_tip.png?1427508744"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""/>

			You can also build turret supports in your base to <b>fortify</b> your position.
		</span>
<br/>
<br/>
		When you have just installed a turret support, the support is <b>free</b>, that is to say without the <b>armed part</b>.
		<br/>
		It belongs to you to <b>choose</b> the weapon you will mount on it.
		<br/>
<br/>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1337001/files/20150329165014-turret_img_a.png?1427673014"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
		You have to know there are three types of turrets: <b>Tier I</b> (machine gun), <b>Tier II</b> (small caliber canon) and <b>Tier III</b> (heavy canon).
		<br/>
		Each tier has its own turret support.
		<br/>
<br/>
<p>

</p>
<br/>
		As you can see above, the tier III turrets require <b>electricity</b> to work fine.
		<br/>
		Besides that, the turret supports can be equipped with something else than a weapon!
		A <b>searchlight</b>, for example, can be plugged on a tier I support. This needs electricity to work, like the tier III turrets.

<p>
<br/>
		This system is quite difficult to explain with words.
		<br/>
		So, here is an example of a simple <b>electrical network</b>:
		<br/>
<br/>
</p><p style=""text-align: center; width: 620px;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1418555/files/20150427072321-ElectricSystem_graph_C_11.png?1430144601"" src="""" style=""""/>
			[ <a href=""http://h2o-game.net/content/media/pict/ElectricSystem_graph_C_11.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">fullscreen</a> ]
		</p>
<br/>
		As you can see,
		<br/>
		each electrical element is built on a platform and adapts to its shape.
		<br/>
		An element creates a <b>link</b> with each <b>adjacent</b> one and together they constitute the electrical network which starts from the <b>control panel</b>.
		<br/>
<br/>
		In this example, the system is <b>stable</b>.
		<br/>
		It means that the <b>power produced</b> by the engine-generators is <b>greater</b> than the <b>required power</b> in the network.
		<br/>
<br/>
		The control panel displays the <b>ratio</b> between these values:
		<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1418445/files/20150427060600-control_panel_2.png?1430139960"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<br/>
		In contrast, if one of the engine-generators <b>runs out of fuel</b>, the generation will not be <b>sufficient</b> to power correctly all the network.
		<br/>
		If it happens, the control panel will <b>turn off</b> and this will shut down <b>the entire</b> system.
		<br/>
<br/>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1332467/files/20150327191224-quote_tip.png?1427508744"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""/>
<span style=""color: rgb(124, 124, 124); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">
			The electrical elements often have a small light which indicates their current operating status.
			<br/>
			-&gt; Off : not connected to a network including a control panel.
			<br/>
			-&gt; Blinking Red : connected to an unstable network, not enough power to turn on the system.
			<br/>
			-&gt; Red : connected to a stable network, but its control panel is turned off.
			<br/>
			-&gt; Green : connected to a running network, the element is powered. 
		</span>
<br/>
<br/>
		You have seen the <b>cultivation device</b> earlier, but there are many others you can install inside your floating constructions:
		<br/>
		Such as <b>elevators</b>, <b>air compressors</b> (used to refill diving tanks), <b>armored doors</b> tier III, <b>turrets</b> tier III, <b>searchlights</b>, <b>loudspeakers</b>, advanced <b>cookers</b>, and so much more.

<p>
<br/>
		As detailed previously, <b>shipyards</b> are required to build vehicles. 
		<br/>
<br/>
		The small shipyard is used for the tier I but you will need a big shipyard for the vehicles of tier II and tier III.
		<br/>
		To give you an idea, in a big shipyard you can <b>park 3~4 tier II</b> vehicles or <b>1 tier III</b>.
		<br/>
<br/>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1332467/files/20150327191224-quote_tip.png?1427508744"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""/>

			Be aware that the doors of the shipyards can be <b>destroyed</b>, it belongs to you to <b>fortify</b> your naval facility to protect your ships.
		</span>
<br/>
<br/>
		Moreover,
		<br/>
		You may have noticed that vehicles <b>aren't all handled in the same way</b>.
		<br/>
<br/>
		Almost all the vehicles of tier I and II can be handled by only <b>one person</b>, but the tier III vehicles (or ""<b>ships</b>"") include at least <b>two control posts</b>:
		<br/>
		The <b>helm</b>, used to maneuver the ship, and the <b>engines</b>, used to manage the ship's throttle.
		<br/>
		You could also consider the <b>turrets</b> like posts requiring players.
		<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		Here are some examples of vehicles, sorted by tier:

			The <b>jetski</b> is the traveler's best friend. Fast and manageable, it will allow you to cover long distances quickly while avoiding trouble. Its hull is quite fragile, but its small size and its speed make it very difficult to hit with a large-caliber weapon.

			The <b>Chitin</b> is the best tool for an itinerant trader. Not armed, slow and noisy... But extremely resistant.

			The <b>Liberty</b> ship is the freight transporter par excellence. It is one of the few ships with a cargo hold, but not much firepower. It is often used for the resupplying at sea of war ships which are running out of fuel or ammo. Unlike most of the ships, this one is equipped with a respawn beacon. A clan which owns a Liberty ship can use it as a mobile outpost when its members venture far from their headquarter.

			The gunboat <b>Erebos</b> is a support ship perfectly adapted for the convoy escort duty. It is faster and cheaper to produce than most of the other ships and its fuel consumption is rather low. The Erebos is equipped with only one tier II turret support, which makes it vulnerable at close combat.

			The <b>Vanguard</b> is designed for combat. High fire power and armored hull, this ship is the best choice for a battle. Its weakness though are its bad autonomy and its large scale. As powerful as it can be, its slow speed also makes the Vanguard easy to surround when alone.

		The <b>classic mode</b> is the main game, it is similar to most of the <b>current multiplayer survival games</b> like Rust or Dayz, to mention only the best-known.
		<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		The <b>battle mode</b>, meanwhile, is a way to guide the players in some <b>great fights</b>.
		<br/>
<br/>
		When you have <b>fortresses</b>, <b>ships</b> and <b>big guns</b>... maybe you will want to see them all <b>in action</b>...
		<br/>
		To make a real assault <b>fleet</b> with many people, to <b>take the helm</b> of a ship on the way to battle, to build an <b>impregnable citadel</b> and put it to the test, etc.
		<br/>
<br/>
		This mode also brings a <b>competition aspect</b> that we think is interesting in a survival game.
		<br/>
<br/>
		The players will still have to eat, gather ressources, craft, build, get fuel, <b>all as the classic mode</b> but they will have a <b>common objective</b>, and a way to <b>win</b>.

<br/>
		Today,
		<br/> 
		the meaning ""alpha"" , with regards to video games, is quite different than five or ten years ago. And often, people thought of a game in its alpha phase as one needing no further development.
		<br/>
<br/>
		The early access is, now, more a kind of game-with-much-content-to-be-added-for-years than a game embryo used to test its gameplay mechanisms.
		<br/>
<br/>
		But this is completely normal, and we can't do anything to change that.
		<br/>
		Adaptation is better and H2o is designed in that way: adding content, fish by fish, vehicle by vehicle, construction by construction.
		<br/>
<br/>
		The problem is, alpha or not, the core of a game has to run well at least and be fun, obviously.
		<br/>
<br/>
		That's why we think that a closed alpha is a necessary step to ensure a pleasant experience to everyone when H2o will be publicly available, even with only the basic content.
		<br/>
		Once that a stable enough version is reached, we will be ready to add content, update after update, without jumping the gun, listening to the community.
		<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		Here it is, the one true problem is time. The time it takes to do the things correctly without frustrate anyone. But for that too, we can't really do something, we can tell you just that we are doing our best to bring this project to life and that we would be happy if a day could last 48 hours instead of 24, by the way.
		<br/>
<br/>
		Considering the eventual problem of patience, here is a schematic representation of the development progression:

	</p></div>","We started to develop H2o over a year ago, after leaving our studies or our jobs in order to work full time on the game.
		

		We have managed to reach an advanced stage of development on our own without over-spending money but, now, we need your help to finalise all the work and release the game as it should be.
		

		Our primary goal of 8500 $ (~ 7500 €) may appear to be rather low for such an ambitious project like H2o, but we don't want to ask for more than we really need to complete the work.
		
		We need it for the software license fees, the official servers rental and various administrative costs.
		

		Having said that ,with more financial support we might be able to expand the development team and thus increase our efficiency,  and bring the game so much further.

				We really want to integrate a way to travel through the flooded land without using a boat. 
				
				The sewers are a kind of underworld network. The entries will be strategically placed in the flooded land, under water most of the time. The entries locations in the land will not change, but the network itself will be randomly generated by the server. It will be your job to map out the network in order to know which exit is linked to which entry in the flooded land.
				
				We want this place filled with darkness... oppressive... to let the players deal with the fear... and the cadaveric beast haunting the tunnels.

				We are pretty sure that aircrafts can be a fun and exciting feature in H2o, and an oceanic environment seems to be perfect for that.
				
				We know that piloting a flying vehicle can be quite hard and that crashing a plane on its first flight after spending much time to build it can be frustrating. But, with aircrafts that can land on water the crash risk is minimised: you can land anywhere, takeoff anywhere, even if you run out of fuel during a flight, you will just glide down to touch the surface of the sea.
			




			[ fullscreen ]
			
				We plan to integrate a kind of hardcore mode in H2o, and winter appears to be the best choice.
				
				The season system will work according to the server time. When winter comes, food becomes more difficult to find, the water surface begins to freeze, trapping the boats in the ice... and when the blizzard will rise, reckless ones are going to freeze to death outside. 
				
				You will have access to a whole new collection of vehicles and equipments to try to survive the weather. Not to mention the addition of heaters and fridges to the electrical system, the diseases and injuries management, and so much more.

				More means is synonym of a better game, a faster development and a stronger team.

		The servers are designed for up to 80 players and will likely be on Linux, unless something unexpected happens during the next months.
		

		The minimum configuration required to run H2o isn't defined yet, this will be determined during the closed alpha phase.
		
		Nevertheless, the option menu is already up and running so the graphical settings can be edited. With the lowest graphics, the game should work fine on most current Pc.
	





		The size of the playable area is about 8 km by 8 km (~ 3.1 square miles).
		


		As you can see in the screenshot above, there are three types of zones, if you don't consider the underwater space.
		

		- Clear zones:
		
		Large areas generally free of obstacles. To maneuver a ship in those places is quite easy but there is no cover. You may often find an oil platform in the center.
		

		- Canyon zones:
		
		Narrow areas which look like mazes. This is the best place to build your home. Hidden by the cliffs, a fortress is much easier to defend.
		
		( You know, bottleneck principle! )
		

		- Flooded cities:
		
		Places where the resources are the most abundant. Cities are very dangerous places, even though you can easily hide in a building. Many players will collect resources there.
		



			 Notice that you can't go in a city with a ship, because if you do, the other players will just have to jump aboard from the roofs and kill the entire crew.
		







		You can find many beasts by browsing the flooded lands.
		

Fishes, birds, marine molluscs... Most of them are harmless and can provide nourishment.
		
		But some others can be very dangerous!
		


		Getting too close to a shark or a jellyfish can be a death sentence for a player who isn't prepared.
		

		That said,
		
		there is currently no threatening animals above of the surface, at least... unless we add an alligator to the bestiary, right?
	
	










To stay alive, you will first have to find food, gather resources, get a vehicle to travel fast and establish a basecamp to protect yourself from other players.
		
		(More details here)
		



			 Even if they are not all necessarily hostile, remember that the others are always the most important threat to your life expectancy!
		


		Once you have built a secure basecamp, your situation has reached a basic level of safety which allows you to go further.
		





		The second step will be to extend your base with a small shipyard, get fuel and make friends (obtional but recommended).
	
	






Without a shipyard, you can only craft one unique vehicle which is not very fast and not so resistant :
		



		The small shipyard gives you access to all Tier I vehicles (size of a jetski).
		

		This is also a place to park your vehicles in order to protect them from others, when you are offline or simply when you don't use them.
		

		To craft a vehicle, you have to gather the required resources in your inventory and then start the production at the shipyard office.
		
		Once this is done, you have to use a collecting tool on the vehicle under production that appeared in the shipyard, up to complete the crafting.
		



			 Obviously, this task is relatively fast with the tier I, but it can take a while with the tier II and III vehicles. You can do this with friends to save time.
		


		But here comes a new problem, most of these vehicles require fuel to run.
	
	






Fuel is power.

		The more you will upgrade your technologic tier the more you will need it.
		

		To use some vehicles but also to feed gensets in your base or to reload a flamethrower turret... Some advanced crafts require fuel too (like rockets, for example).
		

So, how to get it?




		There are three oil platforms in the flooded land.
		
		But only one of these platforms will be active at a time, and sometimes not even one...
		

		You will quickly realize that there is a real ""Fuel War"" because everyone needs it and everyone knows that depriving someone of it will weaken him.
		





		This system aims to balance the access to this resource, to avoid that a powerful team controls all the supply.
		A small group of players can try to ambush when a new platform turns active and the last one runs dry, etc.
		



			 Notice that a player can't carry away more than a small amount of fuel in his inventory. If he wants to take more, he will have to go back and forth from the platform to a special vehicle to transport the fuel. This type of vehicle is often very weak, by the way.
		


		There are many possibilities!
		We give you the means to act, but the strategy is yours!







		Even if it's not an obligation, Making friends is very important in H2o.
		
		The clan system is here to help you with that.
		

		It works pretty much like the ""guilds"" in some very famous MMORPG.
		
		When you want to form a clan with your friends, you simply invite them to join you. You give a name to your clan, you manage the rights of each members, etc.
		

		The position of your clan's members will be revealed on your map, and you will be able to unlock the doors of your home for the other members.
		



			Notice that the friendly-fire remains active in all cases! This system doesn't prevent treason or manipulation, voluntarily.
		






		Once you have vehicles, fuel and allies (except if you choose to be alone):
		
		accessing the tier II and tier III technologies will be much easier.
		

		But the more you increase your capacities the more you become an attractive target for the other players.
		

		The next step will be to prepare your defences!
	
	






		Basically, getting small arms is the first way to protect yourself.
		





		There are many weapons at your disposal in H2o: from the harpoon to the rocket launcher, passing by the nail gun. (More details about weapons here)
		


But your arsenal doesn't stop there!


		Some vehicles (especially the big ones) have turret supports.
		



			You can also build turret supports in your base to fortify your position.
		


		When you have just installed a turret support, the support is free, that is to say without the armed part.
		
		It belongs to you to choose the weapon you will mount on it.
		




		You have to know there are three types of turrets: Tier I (machine gun), Tier II (small caliber canon) and Tier III (heavy canon).
		
		Each tier has its own turret support.
		





		As you can see above, the tier III turrets require electricity to work fine.
		
		Besides that, the turret supports can be equipped with something else than a weapon!
		A searchlight, for example, can be plugged on a tier I support. This needs electricity to work, like the tier III turrets.
	
	






		This system is quite difficult to explain with words.
		
		So, here is an example of a simple electrical network:
		



			[ fullscreen ]
		

		As you can see,
		
		each electrical element is built on a platform and adapts to its shape.
		
		An element creates a link with each adjacent one and together they constitute the electrical network which starts from the control panel.
		

		In this example, the system is stable.
		
		It means that the power produced by the engine-generators is greater than the required power in the network.
		

		The control panel displays the ratio between these values:
		



		In contrast, if one of the engine-generators runs out of fuel, the generation will not be sufficient to power correctly all the network.
		
		If it happens, the control panel will turn off and this will shut down the entire system.
		



			The electrical elements often have a small light which indicates their current operating status.
			
			-> Off : not connected to a network including a control panel.
			
			-> Blinking Red : connected to an unstable network, not enough power to turn on the system.
			
			-> Red : connected to a stable network, but its control panel is turned off.
			
			-> Green : connected to a running network, the element is powered. 
		


		You have seen the cultivation device earlier, but there are many others you can install inside your floating constructions:
		
		Such as elevators, air compressors (used to refill diving tanks), armored doors tier III, turrets tier III, searchlights, loudspeakers, advanced cookers, and so much more.
	
	






		As detailed previously, shipyards are required to build vehicles. 
		

		The small shipyard is used for the tier I but you will need a big shipyard for the vehicles of tier II and tier III.
		
		To give you an idea, in a big shipyard you can park 3~4 tier II vehicles or 1 tier III.
		



			Be aware that the doors of the shipyards can be destroyed, it belongs to you to fortify your naval facility to protect your ships.
		


		Moreover,
		
		You may have noticed that vehicles aren't all handled in the same way.
		

		Almost all the vehicles of tier I and II can be handled by only one person, but the tier III vehicles (or ""ships"") include at least two control posts:
		
		The helm, used to maneuver the ship, and the engines, used to manage the ship's throttle.
		
		You could also consider the turrets like posts requiring players.
		


		Here are some examples of vehicles, sorted by tier:
		



			The jetski is the traveler's best friend. Fast and manageable, it will allow you to cover long distances quickly while avoiding trouble. Its hull is quite fragile, but its small size and its speed make it very difficult to hit with a large-caliber weapon.
			
			Other Models: Fuel carrier, Springboard, Kamikaze, etc.
		



			The hovercraft is the naval equivalent of the humvee. Perfect for outings in hostile territory such as cities. The hovercraft is capable of travelling on water, land, mud, ice and other surfaces.
			
			Other Models: Troop transport, Intervention-Armored, etc.
		



			The Chitin is the best tool for an itinerant trader. Not armed, slow and noisy... But extremely resistant. With its unfolded armored shield, this boat can take the most powerful hit without flinching, at least for a limited time. The player using a Chitin can exchange goods with someone else outside, without leaving his seat and without exposing himself.
		



			The Liberty ship is the freight transporter par excellence. It is one of the few ships with a cargo hold, but not much firepower. It is often used for the resupplying at sea of war ships which are running out of fuel or ammo. Unlike most of the ships, this one is equipped with a respawn beacon. A clan which owns a Liberty ship can use it as a mobile outpost when its members venture far from their headquarter.
		



			The gunboat Erebos is a support ship perfectly adapted for the convoy escort duty. It is faster and cheaper to produce than most of the other ships and its fuel consumption is rather low. The Erebos is equipped with only one tier II turret support, which makes it vulnerable at close combat.
		



			The Vanguard is designed for combat. High fire power and armored hull, this ship is the best choice for a battle. Its weakness though are its bad autonomy and its large scale. As powerful as it can be, its slow speed also makes the Vanguard easy to surround when alone.
		

		and many others...
		
	
	







			[ fullscreen ]
		

		The classic mode is the main game, it is similar to most of the current multiplayer survival games like Rust or Dayz, to mention only the best-known.
		


		The battle mode, meanwhile, is a way to guide the players in some great fights.
		

		When you have fortresses, ships and big guns... maybe you will want to see them all in action...
		
		To make a real assault fleet with many people, to take the helm of a ship on the way to battle, to build an impregnable citadel and put it to the test, etc.
		

		This mode also brings a competition aspect that we think is interesting in a survival game.
		

		The players will still have to eat, gather ressources, craft, build, get fuel, all as the classic mode but they will have a common objective, and a way to win.
		
		That's the point.
	
	







		Today,
		 
		the meaning ""alpha"" , with regards to video games, is quite different than five or ten years ago. And often, people thought of a game in its alpha phase as one needing no further development.
		

		The early access is, now, more a kind of game-with-much-content-to-be-added-for-years than a game embryo used to test its gameplay mechanisms.
		

		But this is completely normal, and we can't do anything to change that.
		
		Adaptation is better and H2o is designed in that way: adding content, fish by fish, vehicle by vehicle, construction by construction.
		

		The problem is, alpha or not, the core of a game has to run well at least and be fun, obviously.
		

		That's why we think that a closed alpha is a necessary step to ensure a pleasant experience to everyone when H2o will be publicly available, even with only the basic content.
		
		Once that a stable enough version is reached, we will be ready to add content, update after update, without jumping the gun, listening to the community.
		


		Here it is, the one true problem is time. The time it takes to do the things correctly without frustrate anyone. But for that too, we can't really do something, we can tell you just that we are doing our best to bring this project to life and that we would be happy if a day could last 48 hours instead of 24, by the way.
		

		Considering the eventual problem of patience, here is a schematic representation of the development progression:
		



		(During the closed alpha, this section may be replaced by a more adapted system like Trello.)
	
	




Thank you for reading all this, we hope you enjoy the project!

<p>In <i>Therefore</i>

<p>With projects like this, we want games to give
something new to the players, to be meaningful, to say something. Today
everything it´s about the cover, things are judged superficially. Maybe
imagination, contemplation and reflexion could lead to another way of entertainment.  </p>
<p>We tend to dissociate games from reality, games are
for evasion, to entertain, to do things you cannot do in reality. We totally
agree! But, imagination and reality... both are nourished by each other. A game
can transmit you something and teach you something, can entertain you but make
you think, reflex, can induce you to contemplation even.</p>
<p>In all our games we want to send messages, to society,
to people, because, without that, you can have a game, yeah maybe, but you
don´t have a game experience. And experiences are what shape us.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Trim Tangle is a nexus of entrepreneurs and creative people who loves interactive entertainment, games and digital arts. There are several members in this collective and plenty of ideas and creative proposals arise from its people.</p>
<p>Actually the core is divided in two different teams working in two simultaneous videogame projects (Therefore is one of these games), supporting each other when is needed. In this web site you can see our profiles. Besides the teams, there are other nexus members and contacts working in their own board games or pen and paper role play games or digital and artistic projects.</p>
<p>We consider games a tool to transmit and express, a tool to connect to others, for us is the perfect channel to send a message, to generate an experience and, of course, a great way of entertainment. Videogames nurture from literature, cinema, arts, music and science to create something unique.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in this times we are facing, videogames (and other digital arts) must evolve, not being just a way of evasion but a way to learn, to understand the human world. Videogames must not been reclusive but connective.</p>
<p>Adults have been cheated to avoid games, except those considered appropriate for their ages. With this we made a terrible mistake, this generation is starting to realize it.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t apply to us, we believe in games as we believe in any kind of artistic expression, and we see both as what they are, a way of innovation, vindication and communication, part of the tangle that weave us together, because we are <i>Trim Tangle</i>.</p>

<b>Diego Corzón</b>
<p><i>Game Designer, Interactive Writer,
Characters and GUI Design and Animation.</i></p>
<p>“World is changing, humanity is changing, games and
videogames must be part of the change” this messianic deviant is our Game
Designer, an idea breeding machine who always convince us to follow him in his
weird experiments. He is one of the promoters of the Trim tangle Nexus and is
the only one in charge of the two videogames projects supported by Trim tangle.</p>
<p>Corzón give his back to a finished Laws Degree and
then studied DGAC (Digital Graphic and Artistic Creation) learning about
traditional and new techniques of illustration, design and animation. Not
having enough, his delirium led him to other weird careers as Narrative
Creation, Interactive Writing and Game Designing, his ultimate passion. Heavens
knows how, he has published tales, articles and essays and has earned some
prizes and nominations in poetry comic and writing minor competitions.</p>
<p>Simultaneously to the both videogame projects (Crisis
Crunch and <i>Therefore</i>), he is working
in a Pen and Paper project, promoting a social collective and practicing as a
mediator.</p>
<p> Corzón loves
games and videogames over all, in fact we think he lives in a perpetual
videogame (¿Isla Piñata, maybe?), he uses literature, philosophy, art, comic, theatre
and the entire audiovisual spectrum to shape his interactive and philosophical nonsense,
and sometimes, just sometimes, some of them worked.</p>
<p>Both Rodrigo (our other game designer) and him made an
explosive duo. A pair of heads that creatively complements each other in a
level we didn´t seen before.</p>

<b>Rodrigo Pascual</b>
<p><i>Game Designer, Art Director,
Background Design, Background Animation and Effects.</i></p>
<p> “Videogames and
games are art, dare to deny it and you will face the rage of my hammer”. Thanks
to the gods he really hasn´t got a hammer, because our
comrade will fulfil his menace.</p>
<p> He has a
storming and peculiar mind, full of smashing ideas. He loves videogames, board
games, family games any kind of games if they are original enough. He devours
literature, cinema and comic books; he likes mythology and anthropology in general and loves nordic myths. </p>
<p>He studied Digital Arts and Graphic Design, he worked in
design studios and works as an illustrator for short films and comic. He is a
great 2d artist and an ace in game mechanics. Simultaneously to this project he
is working in two board games, and he has more ideas in the sleeve. He is also
one of the promoters of the Trim Tangle Nexus.</p>
<p>Be sure that clichés are not his thing; he uses his
work to experiment and break mediatic walls. Epicness is in every fibber of his
body, and independent projects are his life. Working alongside him is like
being inside of Ring of The Nibelungs, so imagine play one of his games.</p>
<p>With Corzón (our other game designer) at his side and
combining their erratic minds, this pair is capable of giving life to any
distorting idea you can imagine.</p>

<p>He has the quickest fingers in town. He is one of the
newest members of the Nexus and our last acquisition in the <i>Therefore</i> Team. We are starting to call
him <i>Speedy Ibañez</i>, tough his capacity
of work and organization it´s starting to be legendary in the Nexus.</p>
<p>He loves videogames, <i>indie</i> and <i>retro</i> games are
his thing, being graphic adventures his preferred gender. He's also an enthusiast of science
fiction, especially Sci-Fi movies. He enjoys reading science books and he is
interested in quantum physics and string theory. Isaac
Asimov, Carl
Sagan and Nikola Tesla
are some of his idols.</p>
<p>He studied Computer Engineering specialized in Artificial
Intelligence and Systems. He worked as Annalist, Systems Programmer and Web
Programmer with big companies as for example, Inditext.</p>
<p>Nico has an outstanding initiative and seems not to
know what risk or challenge means, if he wants to do it he will do it, as
simple as that. We have to face it not other sane programmer will follow this
team to experimental interactive trips of no return, none but Nico Ibañez.</p>
<p>If we are Icarus, crazy enough to fly near to the sun,
Nico is our wings, and he doesn´t seem to be scared of melting down, neither do
us. We know that in his hands we will enjoy a comfortable flight.</p>
<p>Simultaneously to Project <i>Therefore</i> Nico is working in other interactive projects that for

<b>Sergio
García Cuesta

</b><p><i>OST Composer and
Musician</i></p>
<p>Cuesta is a serene person, a peaceful soul, it seems
like he is always waiting for something, but inside his head a revolution is
happened and new ways of expression are being given artistic form.</p>
<p>Cuesta is a thorough guy, a thinker and has a lyrical
spirit. His themes are emotional and experimental.</p>
<p>Since he was a child he knew music was his life, he
studied in the Creative Music School
in Madrid and
has been teached by talented musical icons of classical and modern music and composition
as Jose Luis
Fajardo, Andres
Alen or Ramon Paus.
Fond of instrumental and experimental music, soon he felt the unavoidable pull
of Jazz music, which is why in this moment, and simultaneously to the work in
this project, he is studying the Bachelor of Arts in Jazz Performance in Dublin. He also worked in
short films soundtracks and advertising musical themes.</p>
<p>He likes riddles, mindgames, play on words and puns. Occurrence
is always in the tip of his tongue. </p>
<p>He loves literature and audiovisuals, and of course,
videogames, card games and any strategy game in which he uses to stand out thanks
to his creative strategies and his reflexive behaviour that makes him very good
(without even try it) in competitions.</p>
<p>This creativity, these thoughtful manners, this
profound lyricism... We knew from the start that <i>Therefore</i> soundtrack was predestined to be in his hands, their
intertwine cannot be avoided. And in The Tangle believing in predestination is a
valid choice.</p>

<b>María Benítez
Acosta

</b><p><i>Community Manager.</i></p>
<p><br/>
Librarian during the day, Community Manager by night. Worlds of information and
social networking have no secrets for her. Her vocation is to set up
relations, to discover new pathways, to develop alliances. </p>
<p>Maria studied Library
Science and she worked at the documentation centers of some law
firms and public libraries. Discovering, afterwards, an
unambiguous relation between her past and her future, she decided to study for Community
Manager. Ever since, she didn't stop exploring and (why deny it?) playing with
2.0 web possibilities. </p>
<p>Currently she collaborates with a librarian web
portal, coordinating sections and writing some posts about social media,
books and libraries. She is also making her first steps in illustration, more
specifically in the dark world of librarian fanzines. </p>
<p>Always restless, her hobbies are related with art,
design and creation, going from digital to traditional (such as crochet or
decorated cookies). Undoubtedly, this was the key to create such affinity with
the rest of the Nexus (especially for the cookies). </p>
<p>Her motto is that everything must be perfectly
written, connected, organized and classified, professional bias in its entire splendor.
She will be in charge of dealing with hungry trolls in the virtual
world and helping any curious people that approaches to our project.</p>

<p></p>
</div><p>1. At the same time we are working in this project we are trying to survive XD, we have to earn money somehow so most of us have to spend hours in mid-time jobs and private design requests, funding would help us to dedicate to our project the time it deserves. Nobody wants a member of team leaving because he cannot afford to spend his time in the project. That would be sad because we all know this is what we really want to do, so it wouldn't be easy for this person to leave.</p><p>2. We have to accept it, production peaks happens, but we are a very stubborn team, in fact all <i>Trim Tangle</i> Nexus is made of stubborn people (sorry pals, it´s true), we don’t give up so easily. Production issues have appeared and will appear but we handled them before and will handle them in the future. Of course, there are always be less delays if people could focus all their attention to the project and invest most of their time in its conclusion, again, funding will help us a lot with this fact.</p><p>3. Our greatest nightmare is not to be in touch with you people! Videogame production could be a very “absorbent” job. But we cannot allow ourselves to be out of your reach, we have an excellent community manager and other outer allies who will help us to be constantly updating and sending you news about the project.</p><p> We begged them to create a system which forces each one of us, in despite of the production work, to make a window to personally update some inside info and personally answer some of your comments from time to time.

and you will enjoy a beautiful adventure in a fantasy world but if you try to
replay it using your deduction and perception you will found more than just that.

Due to ambience, simbology and metaphors, Therefore will send a message to those
ready to hear it.
In Therefore
you play as The Wanderer, a being that losts his memories and his voice. He wakes
up in the First Realm, a strange world  being consumed by the
Degradation, a world falling apart. He has no voice of his own but he
can hear voices in his head telling him: “Save the First Realm”. 
Only the player can guide The Wanderer through this
land in the verge of extinction and find out about the forces menacing its existence,
discovering in the process, both The Wanderer and the player, more about
themselves than they expected.

The Wanderer has no memory of himself, he can´t even
talk but he is and extraordinary being with a lot of resources.        
Soon the Wanderer will find out that he is capable of
extracting the Essences, source of existence of The First Realm (which shapes objects,
elements of nature, inhabitants) and use them to forge powerful objects to use
in his behalf.      
He can also activate The Memento Mori, the never-ending
day to retry his exploits. But he must be careful because this day is the
last day of life for the First Realm, passing the midnight the realm will face destruction.      

It´s a place of dying beauty, it resists to disappear,
even in the shores of destruction it´s full of life.
The climatology changes, there are day and night
cycles, the fauna and flora varies depending of the orography, sound and music
change according to the mood of the scenario…     
This floating Realm is the Realm of Realms, the
First of all the Realms in the Tangle, if The First falls the others will fall,
It´s the player responsibility to prevent this from happening.
Music and Sound in Therefore
are the key, there are a lot of musical puzzles and sounds are part of the core
mechanics. Sound and music could lead you to secrets. Poems and riddles are also
a constant.
Therefore  is about immersion and feelings and we are trying
to make a difference in this specific task. Our Musician Sergio Cuesta, has composed
a piano based soundtrack and has played with tonal and atonal harmonies to
create that sensation of beauty tarnished by dissonance and arriving chaos.
The track below it´s one of our main themes and despite it's in its early stages it has won a prize in an inner contest of his music academy.


Full of life and details, Therefore could be considered pixelated art, and that´s what we want:
A great design, pixel FX and deep ambientation. All in this fable is about fantasy and abstraction; the characters are a great example, just look at the captures and the artwork below.     

The Wanderer could take different roads in an open
world. A pixel sandbox adventure like Therefore
allows the player to decide what he wants to do, even if he is ready or not. 
Luckily, The Wanderer can reset the day but this
doesn’t mean the player can evade to face extinction if he is not careful and
doesn’t pay attention to the passage of time.
The Wanderer could decide to help others or not,
serving the faction he desires but if he wants to know who he is, what the
first realm is, he has to fulfill his destiny one way or another.

1. Emphasis in music and sound with active role in the
mechanics.
2. Pixel sandbox adventure.
3. Different paths and endings.
4. Living world.
5. Item crafting thanks to the Essence Forge.
6. Secrets, riddles and hidden cosmogony.
7. Freedom of movement.
8.  A lot of
surrealistic characters.
9.  A story with
different levels of depth.
10. Reset your day, use what you learned and try
again!
Freedom.Indiegogo treats you like an adult who knows what he wants, who can make his own decisions about what sell and how to introduce it to the public. And what is important, Indiegogo lets the backers decide if a project it´s worthy of their interest, applying less project pre-selection or interfering in the team´s way of doing his will based in their best judgment.That is why we chose Indiegogo for both our current projects.Indiegogo works in the same ideological wavelength we do. Creators must be free to introduce their work at their own way and backers and players must be free to support or play the project that means something to them.· Because videogames are art, and art is abstraction, is relative.· Because videogames are experiences and experiences are something intimate and personal.Standards could be something useful, but why not convert freedom of expression in a standard?FundingFinally, we decide to start a crowdfunding profile in order to fund this great idea, with this money we can access to the resources we need, and invest more personal time in the project.Your support is essential for us; we want you to feel free to ask anything, that’s why we pretend to have a well attended social community. You are OUR backers!We are not trying to create a community bigger than we can manage, always quality before quantity or size. To ensure that, we have Community Managing personnel and a team that dangerously enjoys sharing things and gossiping about the project.Working in this kind of projects is a great experience but, of course, sometimes could be stressful and exhausting. Receiving your cheers, your commentaries or simply your hellos will make us remember why we are doing this, besides, we have a lot to do and a lot to learn and you have a lot to teach us, so we want to be sure you have the correct channels to do so.A community is very useful. In a community there are always Trimmers (as we call them) people who share their knowledge and give you a lot of advices and suggestions and also, there are Tanglers, people who gives you hope and diffuses the news, people that connect us to others, making Therefore emerge from the shadows and step up into the digital world.And of course this and the other spectrums of the cyber-life conforms The Players, people who love gaming, or maybe potential players waiting for the perfect occasion to be initiated in the interactive world, we work for you so…Trimmers, Tanglers, Players…Don´t hesitate! Talk to us! We need you! X)


  


With projects like this, we want games to give
something new to the players, to be meaningful, to say something. Today
everything it´s about the cover, things are judged superficially. Maybe
imagination, contemplation and reflexion could lead to another way of entertainment.  
We tend to dissociate games from reality, games are
for evasion, to entertain, to do things you cannot do in reality. We totally
agree! But, imagination and reality... both are nourished by each other. A game
can transmit you something and teach you something, can entertain you but make
you think, reflex, can induce you to contemplation even.
In all our games we want to send messages, to society,
to people, because, without that, you can have a game, yeah maybe, but you
don´t have a game experience. And experiences are what shape us.

Indiegogo funding IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF
INCOME  for Team Therefore in order to
produce the game. The production will last, approximately, 15 months.
As always happens in the first steps of an
indie team, we settled a very low budget. Our team has worked until this date
with no compensation, and after reach our funding goal,  they will work for a half or a third of their
regular freelance budgets or professional salaries.  We are in this project because we believe in
it.







Trim Tangle is a nexus of entrepreneurs and creative people who loves interactive entertainment, games and digital arts. There are several members in this collective and plenty of ideas and creative proposals arise from its people.
Actually the core is divided in two different teams working in two simultaneous videogame projects (Therefore is one of these games), supporting each other when is needed. In this web site you can see our profiles. Besides the teams, there are other nexus members and contacts working in their own board games or pen and paper role play games or digital and artistic projects.
We consider games a tool to transmit and express, a tool to connect to others, for us is the perfect channel to send a message, to generate an experience and, of course, a great way of entertainment. Videogames nurture from literature, cinema, arts, music and science to create something unique.
Nevertheless, in this times we are facing, videogames (and other digital arts) must evolve, not being just a way of evasion but a way to learn, to understand the human world. Videogames must not been reclusive but connective.
Adults have been cheated to avoid games, except those considered appropriate for their ages. With this we made a terrible mistake, this generation is starting to realize it.
But that doesn’t apply to us, we believe in games as we believe in any kind of artistic expression, and we see both as what they are, a way of innovation, vindication and communication, part of the tangle that weave us together, because we are Trim Tangle.






This is one of the teams of the
Trim tangle Nexus, the direct responsibles of the Therefore project:


Diego Corzón
Game Designer, Interactive Writer,
Characters and GUI Design and Animation.
“World is changing, humanity is changing, games and
videogames must be part of the change” this messianic deviant is our Game
Designer, an idea breeding machine who always convince us to follow him in his
weird experiments. He is one of the promoters of the Trim tangle Nexus and is
the only one in charge of the two videogames projects supported by Trim tangle.
Corzón give his back to a finished Laws Degree and
then studied DGAC (Digital Graphic and Artistic Creation) learning about
traditional and new techniques of illustration, design and animation. Not
having enough, his delirium led him to other weird careers as Narrative
Creation, Interactive Writing and Game Designing, his ultimate passion. Heavens
knows how, he has published tales, articles and essays and has earned some
prizes and nominations in poetry comic and writing minor competitions.
Simultaneously to the both videogame projects (Crisis
Crunch and Therefore), he is working
in a Pen and Paper project, promoting a social collective and practicing as a
mediator.
 Corzón loves
games and videogames over all, in fact we think he lives in a perpetual
videogame (¿Isla Piñata, maybe?), he uses literature, philosophy, art, comic, theatre
and the entire audiovisual spectrum to shape his interactive and philosophical nonsense,
and sometimes, just sometimes, some of them worked.
Both Rodrigo (our other game designer) and him made an
explosive duo. A pair of heads that creatively complements each other in a
level we didn´t seen before.



Rodrigo Pascual
Game Designer, Art Director,
Background Design, Background Animation and Effects.
 “Videogames and
games are art, dare to deny it and you will face the rage of my hammer”. Thanks
to the gods he really hasn´t got a hammer, because our
comrade will fulfil his menace.
 He has a
storming and peculiar mind, full of smashing ideas. He loves videogames, board
games, family games any kind of games if they are original enough. He devours
literature, cinema and comic books; he likes mythology and anthropology in general and loves nordic myths. 
He studied Digital Arts and Graphic Design, he worked in
design studios and works as an illustrator for short films and comic. He is a
great 2d artist and an ace in game mechanics. Simultaneously to this project he
is working in two board games, and he has more ideas in the sleeve. He is also
one of the promoters of the Trim Tangle Nexus.
Be sure that clichés are not his thing; he uses his
work to experiment and break mediatic walls. Epicness is in every fibber of his
body, and independent projects are his life. Working alongside him is like
being inside of Ring of The Nibelungs, so imagine play one of his games.
With Corzón (our other game designer) at his side and
combining their erratic minds, this pair is capable of giving life to any
distorting idea you can imagine.



Nicolas Ibañez
Lead Programmer, Web Programmer.
He has the quickest fingers in town. He is one of the
newest members of the Nexus and our last acquisition in the Therefore Team. We are starting to call
him Speedy Ibañez, tough his capacity
of work and organization it´s starting to be legendary in the Nexus.
He loves videogames, indie and retro games are
his thing, being graphic adventures his preferred gender. He's also an enthusiast of science
fiction, especially Sci-Fi movies. He enjoys reading science books and he is
interested in quantum physics and string theory. Isaac
Asimov, Carl
Sagan and Nikola Tesla
are some of his idols.
He studied Computer Engineering specialized in Artificial
Intelligence and Systems. He worked as Annalist, Systems Programmer and Web
Programmer with big companies as for example, Inditext.
Nico has an outstanding initiative and seems not to
know what risk or challenge means, if he wants to do it he will do it, as
simple as that. We have to face it not other sane programmer will follow this
team to experimental interactive trips of no return, none but Nico Ibañez.
If we are Icarus, crazy enough to fly near to the sun,
Nico is our wings, and he doesn´t seem to be scared of melting down, neither do
us. We know that in his hands we will enjoy a comfortable flight.
Simultaneously to Project Therefore Nico is working in other interactive projects that for
sure will make some noise.


Sergio
García Cuesta

OST Composer and
Musician
Cuesta is a serene person, a peaceful soul, it seems
like he is always waiting for something, but inside his head a revolution is
happened and new ways of expression are being given artistic form.
Cuesta is a thorough guy, a thinker and has a lyrical
spirit. His themes are emotional and experimental.
Since he was a child he knew music was his life, he
studied in the Creative Music School
in Madrid and
has been teached by talented musical icons of classical and modern music and composition
as Jose Luis
Fajardo, Andres
Alen or Ramon Paus.
Fond of instrumental and experimental music, soon he felt the unavoidable pull
of Jazz music, which is why in this moment, and simultaneously to the work in
this project, he is studying the Bachelor of Arts in Jazz Performance in Dublin. He also worked in
short films soundtracks and advertising musical themes.
He likes riddles, mindgames, play on words and puns. Occurrence
is always in the tip of his tongue. 
He loves literature and audiovisuals, and of course,
videogames, card games and any strategy game in which he uses to stand out thanks
to his creative strategies and his reflexive behaviour that makes him very good
(without even try it) in competitions.
This creativity, these thoughtful manners, this
profound lyricism... We knew from the start that Therefore soundtrack was predestined to be in his hands, their
intertwine cannot be avoided. And in The Tangle believing in predestination is a
valid choice.



María Benítez
Acosta

Community Manager.

Librarian during the day, Community Manager by night. Worlds of information and
social networking have no secrets for her. Her vocation is to set up
relations, to discover new pathways, to develop alliances. 
Maria studied Library
Science and she worked at the documentation centers of some law
firms and public libraries. Discovering, afterwards, an
unambiguous relation between her past and her future, she decided to study for Community
Manager. Ever since, she didn't stop exploring and (why deny it?) playing with
2.0 web possibilities. 
Currently she collaborates with a librarian web
portal, coordinating sections and writing some posts about social media,
books and libraries. She is also making her first steps in illustration, more
specifically in the dark world of librarian fanzines. 
Always restless, her hobbies are related with art,
design and creation, going from digital to traditional (such as crochet or
decorated cookies). Undoubtedly, this was the key to create such affinity with
the rest of the Nexus (especially for the cookies). 
Her motto is that everything must be perfectly
written, connected, organized and classified, professional bias in its entire splendor.
She will be in charge of dealing with hungry trolls in the virtual
world and helping any curious people that approaches to our project.


  



1. At the same time we are working in this project we are trying to survive XD, we have to earn money somehow so most of us have to spend hours in mid-time jobs and private design requests, funding would help us to dedicate to our project the time it deserves. Nobody wants a member of team leaving because he cannot afford to spend his time in the project. That would be sad because we all know this is what we really want to do, so it wouldn't be easy for this person to leave.2. We have to accept it, production peaks happens, but we are a very stubborn team, in fact all Trim Tangle Nexus is made of stubborn people (sorry pals, it´s true), we don’t give up so easily. Production issues have appeared and will appear but we handled them before and will handle them in the future. Of course, there are always be less delays if people could focus all their attention to the project and invest most of their time in its conclusion, again, funding will help us a lot with this fact.3. Our greatest nightmare is not to be in touch with you people! Videogame production could be a very “absorbent” job. But we cannot allow ourselves to be out of your reach, we have an excellent community manager and other outer allies who will help us to be constantly updating and sending you news about the project. We begged them to create a system which forces each one of us, in despite of the production work, to make a window to personally update some inside info and personally answer some of your comments from time to time. You are our Backers! (Did I already say that?)If you cannot donate, don’t worry friends! You can spread the word! Be our Tangler!, Be the one that connects us to the backers and players. Trough Indiegogo you can share our profile in Facebook, Twitter or Youtube, or you can send our web address to friends and family, our Facebook is hungry for new friends as well as the rest of our social media.

<p>2.- If you draw the card labeled <strong>Charm</strong>, you can use it on a <strong>low HP enemy monster</strong> to capture it. If used successfully, <strong>the monster may become your pet!</strong></p>
<p>You must <strong>care for your pet</strong> by maintaining HP and feeding it. This is important as you look to gain its <strong>companionship</strong> and <strong>support along your journey</strong>.</p>
<p>Your pet can be directed by left-clicking your mouse. It can perform skills, use items, and help in battle, as needed. Your pet’s ability to level up and carry items allows him to be an extension of your inventory.</p>

Survival against all odds while making new friends and enemies is part of the long-lasting fun!
The entire galaxy of Lemuria is procedurally generated — literally everything! You will never have the same experience twice.
 
It all began when a common child arrived at his new home…
Located within the basement was a very strange card, and upon this unique card was a phrase: 'Galaxy Portal'. Then, without warning, it seemed to be activated by an unknown source. To his surprise, the child had been teleported to Lemuria, a faraway galaxy housed within a distant supercluster.

Cards like this were spread all over the world. Due to other portals appearing all over the planet, many others became lost there as well.  Unfortunately, these new inhabitants are unaware they had arrived in a cursed galaxy. Every now and then, the galaxy’s energy just dies out, and in these times of this cursed darkness, the savage monsters that inhabit the galaxy become even more dangerous. It is unknown if a celestial deity or magic from the distant past is the cause, but no matter, the lack of light gives these beasts their new-found energy. In order to survive these foul creatures, you must create your own energy source. The way you play your hand will determine if living is in your cards.

The Galaxy of Lemuria is a massive multiplayer online (MMO) survival RPG with a trading card-based skill system, and a huge, procedurally generated galaxy to explore. You will discover new worlds, moons, and environments. Survival against all odds while making new friends and enemies is part of the long-lasting fun!
The entire galaxy of Lemuria is procedurally generated — literally everything! You will never have the same experience twice.

•MULTIPLAYER SURVIVAL•
Each time you begin you will be transported to a randomly selected planet within the Galaxy of Lemuria. When you arrive, there may be others already present, but are they friend or are they foe? That is your decision, but it’s worth remembering that resources are scarce, and empathy could be your downfall.

Adding others to your friend list will allow you to eventually use cards such as Teleport to instantly arrive at your pal’s location.

 
•PET SYSTEM•
There are 2 ways to obtain a pet currently:
1.- There will be a very small chance (0.01%) of drawing a monster card when you kill a monster. When this occurs, you can either summon that monster as a pet or attach it to weapons/armor for increased stats.
2.- If you draw the card labeled Charm, you can use it on a low HP enemy monster to capture it. If used successfully, the monster may become your pet!
You must care for your pet by maintaining HP and feeding it. This is important as you look to gain its companionship and support along your journey.
Your pet can be directed by left-clicking your mouse. It can perform skills, use items, and help in battle, as needed. Your pet’s ability to level up and carry items allows him to be an extension of your inventory.
  •BUILDING SYSTEM•Each planet will provide you with building materials. Build the home of your dreams with a whole arsenal of materials to choose from — wood, metal, stone and more. Team up to forge a metropolis to protect yourself from those whom would destroy your hard work.   •PROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLDS•The Galaxy of Lemuria features procedurally generated worlds with a plethora of environments. All these contain various resources, monsters, and hidden loot.Exploration of moons and planets to find special materials is the only sure path to success. Use these materials to craft weapons, potions, or food. Be wary of what you create and how it’s used — effects could help OR harm you! •TRANSCENDENTAL ITEMS AND PERMADEATH•Once you die, you will begin again from scratch. All your loot will be dropped. Others may pick it up or you may find your way back to it. Having said that, this title does contain transcendental items. You can pick one item per enchantment to begin with you each time. This helps ease the pain of the permadeath, unlike other games within the survival genre, which leave you with nothing upon starting over.•TRADING CARD BASED SKILL SYSTEM•Every skill in Galaxy of Lemuria is performed with a card. Your stats determine that skill’s effectiveness.The area of your rebirth post-mortem is referred to as “Home”. Here, you can access your decks, card boosters, cards, and transcendental items. You will be able to select and organize which items to take with you at the start of each new adventure.Upon choosing your deck, you will be teleported to Lemuria with the cards and items you have selected. Be wise with your choice of cards, for each one has limited uses. However, when you die, all your cards will be restored for use again. The cards you find throughout Lemuria, however, are not transcendental. This means once used or upon death, these cards are gone forever.Card boosters are acquired through a rewards system. In this system, you obtain booster packs if you can survive for long periods of time and unlock achievements. Cards can be traded and sold between players. •SPACE TRAVELING•The Explorer A1 is a cheap but fast hybrid ship used to explore exoplanets and moons in nearby regions of space. Never pass up the opportunity to gather the resources necessary to build this useful vehicle.The Explorer A1 can travel at high speed thanks to thin layers of titanium. This material is used to construct the outer shell, making the shuttle extremely light.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Welcome, Commander.  You must have heard the news.  The rumors are true: his majesty, King Revland, has died.  His passing has caused a fair amount of turmoil in the bordering realms. The Undead are stirring, coming out of the Forsaken Tundra and raiding outlying villages, the Goblins of Cutthroat Cliffs, who only concern themselves with gold and jewels, seek now for higher ambitions, smelling opportunity further inland, and reports of other races say they are moving forces across forbidden borders, breaking treaties, and amassing armies.</p>
<p>Some of these jokers believe that since the late king has no heir, the throne to the kingdom is up for grabs.  They think that if they can take it by force, the kingdom will kneel to them, and a new dynasty will begin under their law.  I’m telling you that we simply cannot let this happen. Imagine Necrodore, the Undead Lord, sitting upon the throne. It’d be the death of us all!</p>
<p>Forget it!  Defeat is not an option!  The Humans are going to make a stand.  Already, other commanders, like you, have taken up our banner in defense of this great land and claim the throne for us, it’s rightful heirs.  We will bring peace to this land and give it a king worthy to succeed King Revland in honor and justice.</p>
<p>The other races, no doubt, have a similar plan.  To help you repel these forces, you will be given command over our most powerful warriors.  We will supply you with the cost of hiring these troops and give you the tools to obliterate your enemies.  Peace is not cheap. Choose from mighty swordsmen, cunning trappers, vigilant knights, and magic-launching mages.  Assemble your team and join the fight for the throne!</p>

<h3>A Breaking of the 4th Wall</h3>
<p>It is our deliberate intention to keep players inside the world of Birthright by telling a compelling story, constructing an in-depth world to explore and understand, and providing compelling music, voices and sounds, gameplay, and graphics quality, to make certain that what you do in your individual battles has an effect on the world as a whole.  Alas, there will be times where we must pull you from this incredible place and 'break the 4th wall.'  We do this to give you an understanding of the game we play, a game of balance, details, quality, and beauty.</p>
<p>PYE Games is built solidly on the shoulders of a keen designer, a resolute developer, a driven voice and sound designer, a visionary composer, a loyal artist, and a gifted whip-cracker.  We take pride in announcing the world of Birthright, a card-based, battle simulation that draws its characters from a world fused with fantasy and magic and pits them against the forces that would have them eradicated from the world.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>As an indie development company, our resources are small, but our dreams are massive!  Each of us shows ample aptitude in our respective roles, and together, our passion drives this project forward.  There are so many ways we can make this game better, and it's important to us that we deliver a game that is completed, refined, easy to understand and play, and most of all fun.  We need it to be ready at launch so that we can immediately start plans for Season 2, one of many expansions that will widen your scope of the world, further the storylines of these incredible characters, and give you more options for cards in your deck-building collection.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you support us in delivering this project to the world in its intended form.  Some examples of ways this money will be used include:</p>
<p>1.  3D rendered characters that jump from the cards and into the battle ready to fight.  At the moment, the cards played onto the field stay cards when they are in combat.  3D artists and animators can bring these characters to life in a way a flat drawing of a card never could.</p>
<p>2.  A fully orchestrated soundtrack and high quality sound.  It's sad to say it, but these things take money to get them done right.  Your contributions will help in the creating of these beautiful works.   </p>
<p>3.  Telling the story.  We know the power of a captivating story.  Birthright is different than other card games for many reasons, but this one feels the most important.  The characters and races in the land will change over time and you will witness the fall of the mighty, the rise of the weak and weary, and the transformations of the corrupted and insane.  (Do you want to know the best part?  These changes will be because of how the players interact with these characters.  Does the Goblin CEO, Greygrip Satchelsnatcher sit the king's throne at the end of Season 1?  Or is it given over to the Lord of the Undead, Necrodore?  Can the Humans retain this mighty honor?  Or do the power of Dwarven inventions secure the throne for themselves?  It all depends on you.)</p>
<p>4.  Cinematics.  To show the outcomes of the Seasons, to give power to the weak, or to change the DNA of a Human scientist to a rabid Goblin supporter, we need the ability to produce compelling cinematics.  This includes a comic-style overlay, animations, voice-over acting, and vibrant art.  We want a reason to nerf or buff your darling Necromancer Jane that you understand instead of doing it just because we feel like it.  As we said before, we want you to feel like this world is changing and evolving without you having to see the gears and steam vents under the hood.</p>
<p>5.  UX design and integration, polish, and bug testing.  No one is pulled from the world of Birthright faster than a witness of a glitch or a difficult to use interface.  If the card says 'Summon a 3/3/1 Rabid Dog,' and it pulls out a 0\3\0 Random Egg instead, we have a problem.  Bug testing is crucial to removing distractions and giving a fair game to players, and this takes time.</p>

<p>If we have the ability and the resources listed above, you will get an incredibly unique game that rewards strategy, decision-making skills, and study of your opponent.  Our goal is to reach $75,000, but our sights are set on producing something much better than what that money can do for the game.  Some of our stretch goals are listed above, but here are a few more that we can attain as we reach higher funding:</p>
<p>1. More races.  Adding more races to the mix will deepen the world as a whole and change the way the game is played.</p>

<p>3.  The Standard Bearer.  This fellow will stand beside your army and wave your flag to give inspiration to your troops and emotes to your opponent.</p>
<p>In addition to the overall gameplay and as a contributor to this Indiegogo campaign, you will receive specific account rewards, given to you after launch.  Here are some unique perks that can be unlocked for your account.</p>

<h2>Let's Get Specific About Birthright</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>What makes Birthright different than other card games?</h3>
<p>1. The Battlefield.  Birthright is played on a 6x6 grid where you can summon soldiers to the fight from your side of the board.  When playing a card, you can choose from the six spots in the first row, this area is your starting area.  Depending on the battlefield status, you may choose to place the card on spot #1 away from forces massing on the other side, or you could choose to put him directly in harm's way to soak up damage.</p>
<p>For those of you familiar with card games, the battlefield is one of the biggest differences that gives Birthright a unique playstyle from other card games.  Location is everything.  Doesn’t it make sense that if an archer is behind a warrior, then he is more protected from the enemy?  Of course it does!  That’s what gives Birthright an added layer of strategy and opens the door for your opponent to make mistakes.</p>
<p>Lastly, having a game where movement can be restricting sets a pace for the game that can be taken advantage of.  Stick together with a tank up front, a spell caster or healer in the middle, and a sniper in the back, and never let a skeleton get close!  You are so clever and such a great strategist!</p>
<p>2.  Living cards.  We mean this in two senses of the word.  Cards are divided into different rarities, Bronze being the lowest, Silver, Gold, and Platinum, however there is a twist.  Each card is designed with the four different rarities, giving bonuses to abilities and stats as they level up.  Just playing a card like a Bronze Shield Reaver into the battlefield will give it a bit of Experience once the game is completed.  Give it enough Experience, and that bronze card will grow to be a Silver.  Play it more and more, and eventually, that lowly Bronze Shield Reaver becomes a Platinum Shield Reaver that smashes his way onto the battlefield and plows through opponents like tissue paper.  Feel like you need better cards?  Just play the game, and you'll get there without spending a dime.  Give it the effort and gain the reward!</p>
<p>The other living card element is that the cards that you own are intertwined into the story of Birthright.  As major tournaments happen and seasons come and go, you'll see changes to the cards in your collection.  We will have seasonal risk tied to certain cards, and how the players play will decide their outcome at the end of the season.  Here's an example:  Toliver, the Mighty Earth Knight, is a shining example of strength and devotion, but at the beginning of Season 1, his sister, Elena, is abducted by the Undead lord, Necrodore.  Here is the risk:  if more battles are won by Humans during Season 1, Toliver will have successfully regained his sister from Necrodore's clutches, and she will be returned to the Humans as a playable card.  If the Undead win more battles, she will not have been rescued, and she will become a new Undead card called The Bride of Necrodore.  This is serious stuff were talking about.</p>

<h3>Endgame</h3> <p>Ok, as fun as it is endlessly beating the opposing army, what’s the overall point?  What’s the goal?  Well, beyond your enemies is their base, accessible from anywhere in their starting area, that has 20 hit points. Getting those points down to zero will win you the game.  Alternatively, just behind your starting area is your base.  This you must defend because if the enemy knocks its 20 hit points down to zero, it’s game over for you.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Is Birthright Pay to Play?  Is it Pay to Win?</h3>
<p>Birthright will be launched as a free game, and we will never charge just to play the game.  After a short tutorial, you can begin queuing into matches against other players at your skill level.  You will be given the option to pick a preconstructed deck that has been crafted to be competitive and receive all the cards in that deck into your collection.  From there, daily missions will give you an incentive to try new things and reward you with more packs and Experience.</p>
<p>Experience is a resource you can use to increase the power level of your collection, but the problem that most will see immediately is a more powerful card is better than its original version.  Does that mean the player who shells out the most dollars for in-game Experience is going to have the advantage and beat me every time?  The answer is no.  There are a few checks and balances in place that make the game fair.  Firstly, the rarer a card is, the less you are allowed to put it into your deck.  Bronze is limited to 4, Silver to 3, Gold to 2, and Platinum to 1.  This restricts the number of times you will see it played against you.  Secondly, as the power level of cards increases, so does their cost.  This limits the turns the higher cost cards are able to be played.  With this model, the game is not Pay to Win.</p>

<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>Birthright is designed to be a community-driven game, where we, the developers, are open and inviting fan content, lore posts, and constructive feedback on the overall state of the game.  We want to hear from you, implement fan-built content into the game, run art contests, design cards on stream so everyone can have a say.  We want to keep things open and make appropriate changes to the game to help it become the best it can!</p>

</div></div>","Introduction
Welcome, Commander.  You must have heard the news.  The rumors are true: his majesty, King Revland, has died.  His passing has caused a fair amount of turmoil in the bordering realms. The Undead are stirring, coming out of the Forsaken Tundra and raiding outlying villages, the Goblins of Cutthroat Cliffs, who only concern themselves with gold and jewels, seek now for higher ambitions, smelling opportunity further inland, and reports of other races say they are moving forces across forbidden borders, breaking treaties, and amassing armies.
Some of these jokers believe that since the late king has no heir, the throne to the kingdom is up for grabs.  They think that if they can take it by force, the kingdom will kneel to them, and a new dynasty will begin under their law.  I’m telling you that we simply cannot let this happen. Imagine Necrodore, the Undead Lord, sitting upon the throne. It’d be the death of us all!
Forget it!  Defeat is not an option!  The Humans are going to make a stand.  Already, other commanders, like you, have taken up our banner in defense of this great land and claim the throne for us, it’s rightful heirs.  We will bring peace to this land and give it a king worthy to succeed King Revland in honor and justice.
The other races, no doubt, have a similar plan.  To help you repel these forces, you will be given command over our most powerful warriors.  We will supply you with the cost of hiring these troops and give you the tools to obliterate your enemies.  Peace is not cheap. Choose from mighty swordsmen, cunning trappers, vigilant knights, and magic-launching mages.  Assemble your team and join the fight for the throne!

A Breaking of the 4th Wall
It is our deliberate intention to keep players inside the world of Birthright by telling a compelling story, constructing an in-depth world to explore and understand, and providing compelling music, voices and sounds, gameplay, and graphics quality, to make certain that what you do in your individual battles has an effect on the world as a whole.  Alas, there will be times where we must pull you from this incredible place and 'break the 4th wall.'  We do this to give you an understanding of the game we play, a game of balance, details, quality, and beauty.
PYE Games is built solidly on the shoulders of a keen designer, a resolute developer, a driven voice and sound designer, a visionary composer, a loyal artist, and a gifted whip-cracker.  We take pride in announcing the world of Birthright, a card-based, battle simulation that draws its characters from a world fused with fantasy and magic and pits them against the forces that would have them eradicated from the world.

Like in real life, you’ll face deception, betrayal and corruption of the authorities in The Scumbags. At the same time, you’ll get a chance to demonstrate the best human qualities: mutual assistance and self-sacrifice, while being a part of a team and helping your subordinates to win.
 
Workflow

 


 
Creation of such a large-scale game project is divided into many stages. First, we develop the map of London and place our characters there, however after the final testing our players will be able to choose among different cities and travel along unbelievably realistic streets of New York, Tokyo, Moscow or Paris.
 
 

The expenses regarding the first version of
The Scumbags
 

 
The collected money will be used for attracting experienced game developers to the project. Together we will achieve the set goal and complete the first version of The Scumbags.
 
The stated sum 5,383$ will be enough to release the first version of
The Scumbags.

* In case we collect more than it’s stated, we will gradually switch to work on the map selection function, we will be able to diversify the game objects and the means of combat (weapon), will develop ""Team Deathmatch"" game mode and add a ""store"", where you’ll buy clothes and other items for the characters using the money earned in the game.
 
For six months our team has been developing the unique gameplay, we’ve spent a lot of money and time on creating the prototypes of the characters and working out the concept of their relationships.
And today we need your support to move on!",6.0,1,"1 Campaign

I’ve been making games now for 20+ years on Windows PCs. In 2017, with the help of my family and friends, I published my first commercial game, ‘Ye Fenny – Revenge of the Evil Good Shepherd’ on Steam and various other online video game markets. The game received critical acclaim from many gamers around the World, citing its fun feel and retro style, mixed with the random storylines and strange live-action cutscenes.<br/><strong>Checkout Dave's Youtube channel below:</strong> <br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQoLiy8-kdPYOGlGIFjYxg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQoLiy8-kdPYOGlGIFjYxg</a><br/><br/><strong>Nik Lloyd:<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535538958/d6nskvk93yahzbvzwq1n.jpg"" src=""""/></strong><br/>Hi my name is Nik Lloyd, I create some of the music for DPAD-FTW and also write some of the storylines, help with filming, acting and also help where I can with some of the planning for the company.

<p> Hi, I’m Glyn Humphreys – Actor, Voice Actor and Co-Sound Designer for Ye Fenny 2. I played the role of The Young Outlander in Ye Fenny – Revenge of The Evil Good Shepard.</p>
<p>In Ye Fenny 2 I reprise my role as The Outlander (this time also voicing him), and I have taken on a few more acting roles as well. I have also taken on some of the Sound Design responsibilities on this project, contributing more to the heavier side of the music.</p>
<p>I would say we are all quite invested in Ye Fenny 2 (even more so than the first). Not only because we are passionate about the project, but because most of us have other commitments, such as full time jobs. We’ve invested a considerable amount into the project so far too. In my case I’ve purchased software and equipment to try and achieve a better quality of sound for my music production.<br/><strong>Checkout Glyn's Youtube Channel below:</strong><br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTFpZHIdAbl_jFCLeqbRlow"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTFpZHIdAbl_jFCLeqbRlow</a><br/>                                                                                                                                  <br/><strong>Mike Jones:</strong><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535538825/ayprnfymrr8vp0p8w2ew.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>Hello, my name is Mike Jones.

As you can see from the screen shot below, we had to work with a limitation of not having enough costumes. The characters in the shorts, white jumpers and hats are the Gnome Incers. They are a Resistance Army on planet Gnome-8. As they belong to an Army, they all wear the same uniform, so this limitation worked out for us.<br/><br/>But as we go on in our development of Ye Fenny 2, we want to get as many unique characters in the cutscenes and even NPC's (non-player characters in game assets) as possible.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535109208/wrdxx8aqfwnttlu0ezx7.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/>If you help us reach our goal in funding costumes for our video game, you will be contributing to our biggest game to date. If we have more costumes for the characters, we can have more live action, full-motion video in our game, because the characters will be more relevant to the plot and have more personality.  We are currently looking to implement a full feature-length movie into our upcoming project via FMV splits, which will be 30 seconds to 6 minutes long. We currently have 16 minutes of FMV footage and the story has only just begun!</p>

<p>Also we have to think about UK Government Tax which is an additional 20.00%, so after this we are left with $1824, which will be plenty for costumes, makeup and props which I estimate will be around 60.00% ($1024.40). </p>
<p>With projects likes these, there is always overhead contingencies and miscellaneous items we need to produce these full motion videos such as, fuel for travel, food while filming, electricity, donations for our filming location, and if the costume budget runs out and we need certain props or additional tools, we can use part of this percentage which is $729.60 15.00%.</p>

<p>We believe at Dpad For The Win, story telling is a major part of a game. This drives a lot of players to see the game through. We released our first game (Ye Fenny) last year (December 2017) to great acclaim because of the innovation of mixing live action cutscenes together with authentic style gameplay, unique characters and use of music.</p>

</div></div>","David Jones:Hello everyone, I'm David Jones - programmer, artist and project lead for ‘Ye Fenny 2 – Whiplin’s Retribution’ at ‘Dpad For The Win’. I’ve been making games now for 20+ years on Windows PCs. In 2017, with the help of my family and friends, I published my first commercial game, ‘Ye Fenny – Revenge of the Evil Good Shepherd’ on Steam and various other online video game markets. The game received critical acclaim from many gamers around the World, citing its fun feel and retro style, mixed with the random storylines and strange live-action cutscenes.Checkout Dave's Youtube channel below: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQoLiy8-kdPYOGlGIFjYxgNik Lloyd:Hi my name is Nik Lloyd, I create some of the music for DPAD-FTW and also write some of the storylines, help with filming, acting and also help where I can with some of the planning for the company. I use Logic Pro and Reason to create my music. I take inspiration from our favourite video game soundtracks from over the years, but also try to incorporate new ideas where I can into anything I create for the games.Checkout Nik's music Youtube Channel below:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC27SU2YEiiiVtnFI5dt8nFAGlyn Humphreys:
 Hi, I’m Glyn Humphreys – Actor, Voice Actor and Co-Sound Designer for Ye Fenny 2. I played the role of The Young Outlander in Ye Fenny – Revenge of The Evil Good Shepard.
In Ye Fenny 2 I reprise my role as The Outlander (this time also voicing him), and I have taken on a few more acting roles as well. I have also taken on some of the Sound Design responsibilities on this project, contributing more to the heavier side of the music.
I would say we are all quite invested in Ye Fenny 2 (even more so than the first). Not only because we are passionate about the project, but because most of us have other commitments, such as full time jobs. We’ve invested a considerable amount into the project so far too. In my case I’ve purchased software and equipment to try and achieve a better quality of sound for my music production.Checkout Glyn's Youtube Channel below:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTFpZHIdAbl_jFCLeqbRlow                                                                                                                                  Mike Jones:Hello, my name is Mike Jones. I’m one of the actors and voice actors for Ye Fenny 2, I also provide creative input into the storyline and help out in other areas of the game. I also write the back stories for the bosses and other creatures and NPC’s in Ye Fenny 2.Checkout Mike's Twitter account below:https://twitter.com/big_mike_85
The reason why we've decided to campaign our second video game in the first quarter of its development is, we would like to be able to purchase more costumes for characters than we can already afford.We have lots of ideas for characters and the storylines for our game. As you can see from the screen shot below, we had to work with a limitation of not having enough costumes. The characters in the shorts, white jumpers and hats are the Gnome Incers. They are a Resistance Army on planet Gnome-8. As they belong to an Army, they all wear the same uniform, so this limitation worked out for us.But as we go on in our development of Ye Fenny 2, we want to get as many unique characters in the cutscenes and even NPC's (non-player characters in game assets) as possible.If you help us reach our goal in funding costumes for our video game, you will be contributing to our biggest game to date. If we have more costumes for the characters, we can have more live action, full-motion video in our game, because the characters will be more relevant to the plot and have more personality.  We are currently looking to implement a full feature-length movie into our upcoming project via FMV splits, which will be 30 seconds to 6 minutes long. We currently have 16 minutes of FMV footage and the story has only just begun!


We are asking for $2400.00 to complete the filming portion of our game. 
First, I will break down the fees needed: IndieGoGo has a 5.00% charge for hosting on their platform so we are left with $2280 for our $2400 asking pledge.
Also we have to think about UK Government Tax which is an additional 20.00%, so after this we are left with $1824, which will be plenty for costumes, makeup and props which I estimate will be around 60.00% ($1024.40). 
With projects likes these, there is always overhead contingencies and miscellaneous items we need to produce these full motion videos such as, fuel for travel, food while filming, electricity, donations for our filming location, and if the costume budget runs out and we need certain props or additional tools, we can use part of this percentage which is $729.60 15.00%.

Please feel free to checkout our exciting perks to the right. Pick which one is right for you, we have many to choose from.
Don’t worry if we don't reach our full goal, I still plan on finishing the entire game, I've put way too much time and effort into creating the game's engine and getting it to the polished state that it's currently at.
If we don't reach the entire goal, the filming process and characters may have to be condensed a little, but I currently have £375.00 of my own money to put into the costume design as well, which roughly equates to $480.51.

<h3>About the Game</h3>
<p>The game starts with two characters fighting each other. As a player, you have to bring your character into the right mood so that it accepts a peace offer or even offers peace. You both win the game if you achieve peace. You both lose it when one of the character gets killed by the other. Every peace you co-create credits you with points and earns you a better rank. Killing does the opposite.<br/><br/>So, how do you control your character mood? On the screen, you can see your character's current mood with bars for health, fear, and anger. In addition, you have a set of tools that you can use to influence your character’s mood. Every tool that influences the mood is also influenced by the mood itself. This means for example that if you give your character ice cream order to calm him or her down, they can throw it on their opponent if they are too angry. In addition, every hit a character gets from the opponent makes him or her more angry or fearful and less healthy. This too is dependent on the character’s mood.<br/><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Is Needed</h3>
<p>This, project (which is in a very early stage of development, just putting together the idea and set of rules) requires costly elements and stages like first characterization, development, visual design and animation, sounds, and storage.</p>
<p>The minimum amount for a nice project is about $25,000, but at first I'm hoping to source at least $4,000 so that we can get started with professional characterization.</p>
<p><strong>In case we don't reach the first goal </strong>($4,000), all funding are kept for this project until the right sum is made, by other funding channels. </p>

And what has the Odin's ever-watchful eye been so distracted by? The answers to these questions await you in our epic adventure - Road to Dicehalla!      We have chosen the beloved and well-known Norse mythology as a foundation of our setting and mixed it with the tabletop culture and specificities. Our goal is to summarize the great diversity of our favorite games and to pass on all that combined experience to you in our Legendary Adventure. But also - to create a magical world you can explore with your friends at times when it's impossible to gather together in real life. We have found our inspiration in various tabletop titles, such as Talisman, Eldritch Horror, Descent, Runebound, Andor, Pathfinder, D&D, Darkest Night, Mansions of Madness, The Others and of course - Munchkin, UNO and Monopoly (yeah, we know, don't judge).Dicehalla is a world full of pop culture references, famous characters and myths coming to life, all wrapped up in a sparkly humorous adventure.    The core mechanics of our game is a piece of cake - just throw the dice! You set your foot on an endless road, filled with exciting meetings and many dangers, and the only way to go is forward, up until you hit a city or a camp. From there you can travel to any safe zone you've visited before or walk any known path again - every time you follow the same route it's completely unique, for the events are generated up as you go.  The Road to Dicehalla is paved with classic squares of various type.   Create your perfect protagonist using the huge pull of appearance modificators.  While you are on the road you have an access to the main chat, though with some limitations: you can communicate only with stickers. But that's not the case in cities. Once you are in a safe zone you are free to join the text channel for socialization or group searching and to quickly find new friends for the group quests or dungeons.  

 To put it simply - the city is a saving spot where you can find a company,rest and gear up for your adventures.      Upon entering a hot zone you roll the dices to gain energy, as does your opponent. Spend your energy to attack, defend yourself or apply any conditional effects to your foes. You cannot refuse the fight! Go big or go home, bud.The spells and special abilities in The Meeple Story are presented by different cards, each with its own features, type and cost. You can carry a deck of 20 cards total and you're given 5 random cards from your deck at the beginning of the battle. As a card in your active hand is used it goes into the discard pile and you draw a new card from your deck. When the deck is empty, you take all your discarded cards, shuffle them and gain a set of 5 random cards again.Build your own unique deck for every occasion!   Every ability card presents its own playing style: you can be a healer, a damage dealer, or a tank. Your class is formed by the cards in your deck. For example, if the healing spells prevail in your deck, then the game will define you as a priest. If your deck consists of damaging and healing abilities equally, you will be seen as a paladin. Don't be afraid to experiment - sometimes the most daring combinations tend to lead to most curious results.    Each of these parameters will help you maximize your performance in the battle: the bigger the stats, the stronger your spells and abilities are. Your parameters grow by every level but you can also boost them with special items and a bit of magic.    You will find 2 types of equipment in The Meeple Story - weapons and necklaces. They affect your stats and your passive abilities, some of these items can even change your character's appearance. You have one slot for your weapon and one slot for the necklace. Use them wisely!   Strength lies in unity. And there are some trials that will pose a challenge for a lone wolf. However, we have some good news! Our game is MMO for a reason. Yes, you got it right: you can fight for Dicehalla's freedom with your friends, adversaries or just some random passers-by who won't be that easy to get rid off.    The dungeon is a restricted area, section of the Great Road, filled with mighty opponents, dangerous bosses, a story and some problems you and your teammates have to solve.To enter a dungeon you must talk to a Dungeon Master in a city, wait up until your party of 4 companions is full and then proceed forward to glory and epic loot! Every dungeon has its own Master but as you complete an instance you will be allowed to sign up there again with the help of any Master from any city.   When the party is gathered the system will automatically choose the leader and unleash your group into the road of pain and suffering (but of loot and fun as well). The leader is responsible for the party's progress and gets a hold of the movement dice. As you step on a Hunting Square you activate a fight. Each player is given 30 seconds to decide their next action. If you run out of time or you have an AFC player in your group - do not fear! The system will make a choice for you. You gain an increased experience and reward for every won battle, and defeating a boss may grant you some rare equipment, spell, cosmetic item or a pet.Dungeons are usually full of traps and random events that will put your party's resilience and intellect to the test. And don't forget about the choices! Everybody loves choices, right?In the end of each dungeon you will have to decide how your run ends. The players will choose the most preferable path and roll the dice. The winner's option will be final for the group.  You don't have to become allies with the first person that comes along of course. Who said that you're here to make fast friends? Screw 'em all. Especially that guy. Once you step on a square where someone else is standing already, feel free to challenge them to a AI fight and force them back from your spot. That's right: no one gets in your way! But beware: when your fresh-made enemies are back in game they will know who is to blame for their loss of progress and dishonor. Next time they see you on the map they will recognize you by a special nemesis mark and will have an advantage against you in the following battle. And so the endless circle of meeple bloodshed begins... You could have just passed by, you know?  

 Combat bonuses and muscle mass are not the only stats that you can upgrade for your Hero. They've got emotions, their own exceptional temperament, and it is in your power to influence their personal growth. You will get a certain reputation based on your choices and decisions, and the locals will judge you by it. If you are a known scoundrel and are famous for kicking old ladies and throwing litter on the streets then the humble and lawful NPCs will treat you with distrust and will avoid talking to you. On the other hand, of you're noble and kind to people the same NPCs will be overjoyed to see you and will be happy to give you quests. Maybe they will even shower you in gifts just because you are that cool.  The Meeple Story contains two types of quests: main quests and side-quests. The former can't be skipped, though missing the latter is pretty easy, so if you have the spirit of a true Achiever and want to collect all possible rewards for every quest out there, you will have to visit the same location more than once. It's going to require some dedication and the most thorough exploration but it will certainly pay off.There are multiple quests in the various explorable areas that will adapt to your meeple's personality, so the chances that you will find a truly unique scenario are high.  We're planning on adding three big story arcs to the game, each of them full of exciting adventures, funny plot-twists, alternative universes and epic explosions. On your journey you will have to resolve various conflicts, and each successful outcome will bring you closer to your ultimate quest - saving the world!As you travel throughout the world you will see some familiar faces and meet the heroes who will help you (or mess with you) while you are on your very important mission.   Loki - a long-time friend and an adviser to Odin. The god of mischief and lies as well. Don't ever play cards with him. Odin - the Great and Mighty. Our king and god, also just a great guy in general. There word is, he's starting to lose his grip lately, buuuuut we still love him.Mamon - the local dealer. You can buy anything from him. For a price.Hel is... Well, no one knows where she came from and what she wants, but there's talk of her magnificent cookies... made of blood of her enemies.Thor - the son of Odin, gone missing during the events in Dicehalla. Whereabouts are unknown.Sif - Thor's wife. She's cleaning up the mess left by her husband's sudden disappearance. Wild wolves ain't gonna hunt themselves down!Torrel - the gentlest of souls in a body of a muscular hunter. Has a soft spot for butterflies.Mimir - the famous stand-up comic. A little big-headed for his size, though.Bob. Just Bob.And many others too!     In addition to valuable stuff you can also find some cool but mostly useless trinkets - just to show off to your friends and enemies. It won't be easy to acquire them but it's totally worth it. Who else gets to boast of a singing sword made of Earth's core?  Who needs those old-fashioned town bards? You can buff yourself on the road, using field alchemy. CAUTION: possibility of explosions, vomiting, death.  The road can get lonely when you walk alone. It may be a good idea to find a companion or two to keep your company.   Collect items and herbs for crafting on your way to Dicehalla, but be careful! Danger lurks around every corner!  So, yeah, sure, Scandinavia is awesome! But what about... pirate dinosaurs from outer space?! The Meeple Story offers you plenty unique locations and settings to explore - literally for anyone's taste. Have you ever wanted to see a viking in a western? Yeah, we neither. But we've got them, buddy!              We are a really small team, and this project is really big and time-consuming. That is the reason why we are starting our journey here on Indiegogo - to expand and create something truly worthwhile.We have an experience of developing smaller projects, not as ambitious in comparison, but here, with Meeple Story we are taking it to a whole new level. We are ready to fight for this game, no matter how successful is this campaign - it's only a matter of time, not quality.We all are pretty realistic people and we do realize that creating of Meeple Story will take A LOT of our time and effort and we are ready for it. We grew to love this story with all our hearts and we sincerely hope that you guys will love it as well.  Alex Yudakov - background artist, UX/UI designerAlex is responsible for the backgrounds and the interface design of our game. Working as an art director in an advertising company, has more than 10 years of designing experience, advertising, web and apps design. Took a liking to games developing about three years ago, has been working on projects for iOS and Android. Our rational head.Ivan Stepanov - game designer, character artistIvan is our lead artist, designer and the sweetest human being just in general. It was him who drew all those precious little meeples and he is the person who is responsible for all our characters' design. Has an experience in designing games for advertising companies and creating games and interfaces for mobile apps. Been drawing since he was in nappies. Maybe even before. Fancies tabletop games, collects and even creates some new ones for his friends and family.Svetlana Kalashnikova - Narrative Designer, Community ManagerSvetlana is responsible for the story and narrative parts of our game. A graduated graphic designer, she works on video game advertising, and also has an experience in narrative design for mobile games. Adores cats and DnD. Loves games.Ivan Sisoev - composer and sound-disignerIvan has written that awesome soundtrack of our beautiful trailer. Not just the music itself, but every sound, as well. Ivan calls himself a composer, believing that every sound is an element of a bigger system and always belongs to a composition. Above all he appreciates the mood that the sound sets, and not just its sounding. For example - the tune in the end of our trailer is depicting a brave, but a little bit clumsy hero, crossing the river, leaping from rock to rock. No one's actually leaping there, in the trailer itself - but the sound can tell us a little story nonetheless.Things Ivan is proud of the most (besides various games and videos) are his work with Mercedes-Benz, collaboration with one of the biggest russian TV-networks and creation of ambient sound for public city places.Ricko - animatorRick is our animator. He breaths life into our little meeple creations, makes fire move naturally, clouds float and spells sparkle with thousands of stars. Rick is a great professional, an amazing clipmaker and he has done dozens of fantastic videos in his life. Worked with Paramount Comedy at some point. His works can be found here.Rustam Kuchumov - programmerRustam is our amazing programmer. Has a significant experience in developing, including augmented reality projects, MMO and simple mobile arcade games. A big fan of RPGs, complex stories and numbers.Special thanks to:Darkk Mane for his awesome voice acting skills and generally being such a nice dude.Valeria and Anastasia for helping us translating this page so we won't screw anything up, and also our moms and dads and also grandmas, we love you, guys!",71.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>There will be a multiplayer in the game. You can go to mission with your friends, fight in an arena and participate in command battle with 5-6 players on each side.</p>

<p>My name is Sergey Baranov, i'm 32 years old. I'm a 3D-artist for many years. I like my job, and i like video games much. Like many other gamers, i always wanted to create a game by myself. But my programming skill was poor and this is not allow me reach the dream.</p>
<p>About a year and a half ago I realized that I had to try. I don't have any friends, which can leave his job and spent all time for a game developing. Then i start to study Unity-developing and C# scripting. Then I needed skills in riggind, skinning, animation, user interface developing, writing shaders, vfx, mobile optimisation, databases, working with video, etc. It wasn't easy. I wanted to start from simple game, but I could not make a game that I'm not interested in playing. Because of that the project was constantly growing, supplemented and redone.

<p>Thank you!</p>
</div></div>","The ship has equipment, that is intended for maintenance bot assembly and repair. But in current situation this equipment is must to be used for fight purposes. You'll have to start with a repair bot, which is adapted for battle.

With progress in the game you'll receive some robot and weapons drawings. Saved up enough resources, you'll be able to create real masterpieces of robotics, and arm them with powerful weapon. 




 

So, your crashed ship is a base. Here you can create and repair robots, arm them, open new abilities and research new technologies. Also there is a possibility to communicate, trade and compete to other players.

To protect a base and an AI core from enemies attacks, it's possible to install defensive devices in the ship, like doors, turrets and traps. You can also defend the base by your robot.

It's known that best defense is attack, so the game is varied here. It's necessary to went in exploration missions, hunt for resources, fight against bosses. Alone, or with your friends.

For constructions, creations and improvements you will need resources. You can get them by taking and keeping special mines. But resources are necessary to all, so don't wait that you will get  these mines easily.
 

Action take place on the planet, where an advanced civilization was flourished long time ago. Now this planet is desolate. You can meet here only hostile mechanical monsters. They are patrol wastelands, seek downed ship's remains, and defend resource-rich lands.
You can meet small melee and ranged-combat enemies,

Strong enemies, who use various fighting abilities.

And also bosses and many other types of enemies.
You can't leave the planet now. Artillery, that shot down your ship can do this again easily. Because of that you need to investigate what is going on this planet, what those who command monsters want. And fight a lot to return your freedom.
 

There will be many weapon types in game. Various light and heavy weapons for melee and ranged combat can be created by ship's production capacity.

A good weapon will give you extra abilities.

 

Almost everything can be upgraded: AI core, base, mines, robots bodies and weapons. 

 

I made an unique battle system. The main feature is the active use of temperature and energy.
For example if you will hit enemy with plasma-type weapon, the target will heating. The target's metal will colored red and when temperature reached high value, the target will burned and take additional damage. Metal cools down with time.

If a weapon's damage type is cryo, then a target slows down, covered ice and after all it will be frozen.

You can also disable target temporarily, by overload it system with energy-type weapon.

An environment also influence a battle. For example the air in desert is very hot, and it will be easy to burned a target.
 

The game will be free to play.
Of course there will be a paid services in the game. But a player can complete all quests, achieve a high rating and obtain best equipment (but not unique looked) without investing money. Purchases just let a player save time for level up, get more fun from a gameplay, get unique-looked bots and weapons, accessoires, light up nicknames etc.
There will be a multiplayer in the game. You can go to mission with your friends, fight in an arena and participate in command battle with 5-6 players on each side.
Game will be released at the end of 2019.
 

My name is Sergey Baranov, i'm 32 years old. I'm a 3D-artist for many years. I like my job, and i like video games much. Like many other gamers, i always wanted to create a game by myself. But my programming skill was poor and this is not allow me reach the dream.
About a year and a half ago I realized that I had to try. I don't have any friends, which can leave his job and spent all time for a game developing. Then i start to study Unity-developing and C# scripting. Then I needed skills in riggind, skinning, animation, user interface developing, writing shaders, vfx, mobile optimisation, databases, working with video, etc. It wasn't easy. I wanted to start from simple game, but I could not make a game that I'm not interested in playing. Because of that the project was constantly growing, supplemented and redone. I understood, that i am advance too slow, and i leave my job. The accumulated money was enough to be engaged in development for another year and in the end I had a small demo version for android.

<p>My name is Andrew, I'm a lonely developer and a true indie. I don't have much funds, so I use my money wisely.

<h3>About Tactical Kit for board RPG's</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Hello dear Adventurers! My name is Artorio. I'm a game designer in a small freelance game development studio and I want to tell you about my latest ""invention"". It's a set of tools that helps you to show precise positioning for characters and their enemies in all environments and in any board game that uses turn based combat like DnD, Pathfinder, WoD etc.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481919413/bc7zjauumifvvhjv7uww.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Simply, unfold it, draw the play area, place tokens that represent characters and enemies and begin combat where you can count every step and see what your characters see. You can easily take this Kit  outdoors or to a cafe, but its solid reusable surface is even great at home.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481919442/idk1rhoe4u5nxw35bg83.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Mat made from plastic plates with aluminium arming surface protected with an acrylic layer so you can safely use any type of water marker on it thousands of times. I can create a mat cover from two types of material: natural leather and ""denim like"" fabric. Also other accessories comes in these two types of material except chips. We create the chips from real wood with laser cutting technology.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481919529/z700jdf4unut5xqpdrtp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The idea to create this kit for actual board gaming came to me few years ago. I created several prototypes, and tried them with friends in our epic adventures. All them work well, but we gained not only EXP while playing, we also tried to figure out what combinations are the best. So this prototype you see here has some ""real background"". In my party experience its really cool to use it ""on board""!</p>

Hello dear Adventurers! My name is Artorio. I'm a game designer in a small freelance game development studio and I want to tell you about my latest ""invention"". It's a set of tools that helps you to show precise positioning for characters and their enemies in all environments and in any board game that uses turn based combat like DnD, Pathfinder, WoD etc.

Simply, unfold it, draw the play area, place tokens that represent characters and enemies and begin combat where you can count every step and see what your characters see. You can easily take this Kit  outdoors or to a cafe, but its solid reusable surface is even great at home.

Mat made from plastic plates with aluminium arming surface protected with an acrylic layer so you can safely use any type of water marker on it thousands of times. I can create a mat cover from two types of material: natural leather and ""denim like"" fabric. Also other accessories comes in these two types of material except chips. We create the chips from real wood with laser cutting technology.

The idea to create this kit for actual board gaming came to me few years ago. I created several prototypes, and tried them with friends in our epic adventures. All them work well, but we gained not only EXP while playing, we also tried to figure out what combinations are the best. So this prototype you see here has some ""real background"". In my party experience its really cool to use it ""on board""!
