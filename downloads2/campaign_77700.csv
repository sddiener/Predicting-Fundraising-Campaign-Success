We are students with big ideas for Mars!We are a diverse team of graduates, undergraduates, and faculty advisers at Arizona State University. We want to see humans explore and colonize Mars in our lifetimes! To achieve this goal, we began adapting an open source vehicle to aid the construction of a habitat for humans on Mars.Todd and the team builds a wood 1/3 scale model of MarsTrac.""Why does it look like an Erector set?"" Our concept is to reuse a small set of standardized parts to build our vehicle and support systems. This makes our design incredibly redundant without extra complexity, because you only have to retain a smaller set of replacement parts and a simpler maintenance setup.(Lucas Blog, Open Source Ecology)In the future, other machines can be built using the same pieces. We can construct an entire industrial ecology for colonists on Mars! Even using current methods and research, NASA and it's partners have shown you can separate martian soil into metals, and separate the gasses in the martian atmosphere into fuels such as methane.  (See: Sabatier reaction andISRU)Together, we will turn these basic components into more complex machines, not just tractors and lathes, backhoes, and CNC machines; but entire support industries for our hypothetical colonists.

Where did this idea come from?!Open Source Ecology's Life Trac 6The above video is the Life Trac 6, the original design for earth-based agriculture developed by Open Source Ecology, a project to redesign the 50 machines all modern society is founded upon. It was our inspiration, and our goal is to adapt and expand this amazing project to the exploration and development of the Red Planet.  By helping fund our student lead team, you will be helping to push humanity beyond Earth and into being a multi-planet species!What We Need!We need to raise $16,000 to build the vehicle and do initial testing to improve it. Here is the breakdown:
$5000 for the steel frame and hardware. (Hollow rounded square 4x4 steel tubes, bolts and nuts.)
$4000 for our modified ""power cubes"" (Frame, engines, hydraulic pumps, batteries, sockets, switches.)
$3000 for our Hydraulic/Electric system (Tubing, cylinders, connectors, wiring, motors)
$2000 for our Remote Control system ( Control panel, electronic actuators.)
$2000 for the transport  and support fees for the Mars Desert Research Station.

will play out online via a watch and vote system. The prize is $1,000. Students
are not required to participate; however, if they want a shot at the prize

<p>The second voluntary competition is patterned after the
popular TV show, “<b>Shark Tank</b>.” [we stress no affiliation with the actual show, we just think it's cool]. Students will pitch their business idea to a
panel of five judges and will be rated on a variety of criteria. </p>
<p>This competition, which also carries a $1,000 prize, is
not open to the general public, rather a select number of seats – 25 – are up
for purchase for $25 each. [see option to purchase at right]. Anyone can purchase a ticket

I graduated in English Literature here in Venice. After that opening an Anglo-American bookshop was rather predicatable...</p>
<p>I did that last November. I work everyday with Venetians willing to read in English, with the Anglo-American expats living in Venice and with tourists from - you can imagine - all over the world.</p>
<p>In a few months my bookstore, I'm happy to say, has already become a reference point in Venice since here there are no other English speaking bookshops !</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Business is going comparatively well, luckily enough. But as you know, <strong>book market is not easy and we are really small</strong>. To start the business I asked the help of the Italian State (special funds for young entrepreneurs) yet Italian bureaucracy is making me crazy - the funds have been approved of but I've been waiting for them since last November ! So I had to use only my money to open the shop.</p>
<p><strong>We need some help for ordinary expenses, especially to pay off the rent </strong>at least for one year. We want to grow and become a big cultural centre here in Venice - we are already doing many things (book launches, book club, cinema at the bookshop through Wellington Nickelodeon, conversations with authors etc.) yet <strong>we certainly need a help to bear all the expenses which here in Italy, especially for the first year, are huge</strong>.</p>
<p>If we don't reach the goal, all the money we might collect will be anyway invested in the bookshop, in any of our needs, from the rent to light bills etc.</p>
<p>Giving to our pledge you can <strong>become a member</strong> of our <em><strong>Wellington BooKs-Venice Club</strong></em>, a special group of people who share an interest in Literature, books and Venice. If you come to Venice, <strong>you can get books from us with a 50% discount</strong> and if you donate a generous amount you'll get a book on Venice as a present  and many other things !</p>
</div> <div> </div><h3>The Impact</h3><div> </div><p>The existance of an Anglo-American bookshop in Venice is important for some main reasons:</p><ul>

</div><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>People are dying and being severely injured on the dark streets of Costa Rica. Without streetlights or sidewalks people are forced to walk on the street within inches of passing motorists. Reflective arm and ankle bands are a simple, inexpensive solution to this pervasive problem as they help both the pedestrians and drivers. We have created a small, local Women's Collaborative where the woman hand-make and sell Reflective Safety Bands to their community, bringing light to the dark streets of Costa Rica. </p><p></p><p>        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457550933/nisyp8f7u9lkhrsnx1lb.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 274.1717791411043px;height: 205px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457550967/pblahphasvbr5zbmgvhl.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 273.05px;height: 205px;""/></p><p>               An iPhone photo with flash is an impressive example of how bright <br/>                 our Reflective Safety Bands are at night to an oncoming vehicle. </p><p><b>About Us</b> </p><p>
We are a mom, dad, three kids, and (now) two dogs from Boston who moved to the rural, Pacific Coast of Costa Rica in July 2014, simply to see the world through a different lens. Our perspective of life certainly has changed in the short time we’ve lived here. Sure, we now know what it means to live with cows, howler monkeys, chickens, street dogs, and countless varieties of reptiles at our front door. We also now understand why Ticos (the name Costa Rican's call themselves) were recently named the ""Happiest People on Earth.""  Finally, living here has illuminated  how easy it is to take for granted the privileges we have in the US, where our tax dollars ensure the safety and security of our public spaces and residents.  </p><p><b>The Challenge</b></p>
<p>Road-related fatalities rank fourth in causes of death in Costa Rica. There are three times more pedestrian fatalities than alcohol related accidents in Costa Rica. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Being on the roads at night is a dangerous and scary experience for pedestrians </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> motorists.  It gets dark here by 6:30 pm every night of the year and it's very hard to see what's ahead.  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The roads are narrow,  have no sidewalks, and rarely have any street lights. Nevertheless, the road is the only place to walk.  Jungle on both sides or fear of snakes in the brush keeps everyone on the road. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Only 18% of age-eligible drivers have a driver’s license. The rest travel by bus, bike, moto, or walk and many assume that because they can see the oncoming cars bright headlights, that the drivers can see them  … but they can’t.  </span></p>

Eighteen months earlier, he was hit by a car at 5:00 am while leaving work in Tamarindo and lost his leg.  He was lucky enough to meet a very generous expat who sponsored his recovery (and TEFL training) and arranged for him to be fitted and treated for a prosthetic leg. Needless to say, this support is not typical of others who have been injured on the local roads. Keith is super supportive of this project and excited to be able to offer the bands to his community. Our goal of this project is to prevent others, like Keith, from being hurt on these dark roads.</p><p style=""text-align: start;""></p><p><b>The Solution</b>: </p>
<p>Shortly after we moved here, Eli conceived of the idea to create and distribute reflective bands for the people living in the surrounding area.  We are now making this idea a reality.  There are about 3,000 residents in the surrounding towns (Potrero, Flamingo, Brasalito, Huacus, Villa Real, and Matapalo).  We have purchased enough reflective material from the States for a first run of 3,000 bands. Thanks to an introduction by Laetitia Deweer, founder of CEPIA, <a href=""cepiacostarica.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cepiacostarica.org</a>, an incredible non-profit community center here, we have teamed up with some amazing women in the surrounding area, allowing us to start: <b>Proyecto Bandas Reflectantes: Collaboration de Mujeres / Project Reflective Safety Bands: A Women’s Collaborative</b>. </p><p><b>     </b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F9tFbtqYMoGc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9tFbtqYMoGc%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F9tFbtqYMoGc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><b><br/></b><p></p><p><b>Meet the people who are making it happen</b>:</p><p>These four women have already made almost all 3,000 bands.

<p><b>Distribution Challenge - </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We
have wrestled with how to distribute the Reflective Safety Bands and track the
impact they have on the roads. After much consultation, trial and error, our
initial plan is to give them away for free at the local markets, churches,
schools, on the streets, etc. We have created explanatory displays in English
and Spanish with rings of 40-60 bands attached and have hung them in many bus
stops, markets, and popular road-side areas. We’ve watched as they disappear
one-by-one and had great feedback so far.</span><br/></p>
<p>Needless
to say, this method is quite costly. We hope to supplement the costs (currently,
approximately $1.25 / band) through private and corporate donations and
purchases by local business who believe in the Project and want to give them to
their workers. </p>
<p>Another
option we’ve considered is creating micro-business opportunities for local Tica
women, including our seamstresses. They would receive the bands from the
Collaborative, sell them to their community, and return 50% to the
Collaborative. Hopefully, growth will occur when word of this project spreads to
the surrounding areas and we are able to create opportunities like this in much
of Costa Rica. </p>

</div></div>","IntroductionPeople are dying and being severely injured on the dark streets of Costa Rica. Without streetlights or sidewalks people are forced to walk on the street within inches of passing motorists. Reflective arm and ankle bands are a simple, inexpensive solution to this pervasive problem as they help both the pedestrians and drivers. We have created a small, local Women's Collaborative where the woman hand-make and sell Reflective Safety Bands to their community, bringing light to the dark streets of Costa Rica.                         An iPhone photo with flash is an impressive example of how bright                  our Reflective Safety Bands are at night to an oncoming vehicle. About Us 
We are a mom, dad, three kids, and (now) two dogs from Boston who moved to the rural, Pacific Coast of Costa Rica in July 2014, simply to see the world through a different lens. Our perspective of life certainly has changed in the short time we’ve lived here. Sure, we now know what it means to live with cows, howler monkeys, chickens, street dogs, and countless varieties of reptiles at our front door. We also now understand why Ticos (the name Costa Rican's call themselves) were recently named the ""Happiest People on Earth.""  Finally, living here has illuminated  how easy it is to take for granted the privileges we have in the US, where our tax dollars ensure the safety and security of our public spaces and residents.  The Challenge
Road-related fatalities rank fourth in causes of death in Costa Rica. There are three times more pedestrian fatalities than alcohol related accidents in Costa Rica. Being on the roads at night is a dangerous and scary experience for pedestrians and motorists.  It gets dark here by 6:30 pm every night of the year and it's very hard to see what's ahead.  The roads are narrow,  have no sidewalks, and rarely have any street lights. Nevertheless, the road is the only place to walk.  Jungle on both sides or fear of snakes in the brush keeps everyone on the road. Only 18% of age-eligible drivers have a driver’s license. The rest travel by bus, bike, moto, or walk and many assume that because they can see the oncoming cars bright headlights, that the drivers can see them  … but they can’t.  
                                                        Our friend Keith who lost his leg in a roadside accident.Debbie had the fortune of spending a week with Keith at a TEFL Training last year where they were certified to teach English as a second language.  Keith was in the training to acquire new skills because he was no longer able to do his previous job. Eighteen months earlier, he was hit by a car at 5:00 am while leaving work in Tamarindo and lost his leg.  He was lucky enough to meet a very generous expat who sponsored his recovery (and TEFL training) and arranged for him to be fitted and treated for a prosthetic leg. Needless to say, this support is not typical of others who have been injured on the local roads. Keith is super supportive of this project and excited to be able to offer the bands to his community. Our goal of this project is to prevent others, like Keith, from being hurt on these dark roads.The Solution: 
Shortly after we moved here, Eli conceived of the idea to create and distribute reflective bands for the people living in the surrounding area.  We are now making this idea a reality.  There are about 3,000 residents in the surrounding towns (Potrero, Flamingo, Brasalito, Huacus, Villa Real, and Matapalo).  We have purchased enough reflective material from the States for a first run of 3,000 bands. Thanks to an introduction by Laetitia Deweer, founder of CEPIA, www.cepiacostarica.org, an incredible non-profit community center here, we have teamed up with some amazing women in the surrounding area, allowing us to start: Proyecto Bandas Reflectantes: Collaboration de Mujeres / Project Reflective Safety Bands: A Women’s Collaborative.      Meet the people who are making it happen:These four women have already made almost all 3,000 bands. They are grateful to have this earning opportunity and proud to be contributing from the beginning to a project that will directly impact their community. Listen to Thais' video in the Gallery above (in Spanish).               
                        Meet the founding members of our Women’s Collaborative:                                   (From left to right) Ana, Olga, Auyda, and Thais. 
Alfonso at HangTen, a local print-shop, has been super helpful in putting instructional information and photos on the bands.  The inside of the bands have photos with and without light and explain: ""Drivers can't see you until they are too close. This band reflects light back to the driver from far away. Wear it on your  wrist or ankle."" The band also has a local WhatsApp number and email encouraging questions, feedback ... and hopefully a request for more bands.                                          Debbie and Talia at Hang10 which is printing instructions                                                      on the inside of the bands.

            

                                       Noah and Nava at Thais's sewing machine.              On March 8th, the women threw a surprise birthday party for Debbie.

Distribution Challenge - 

We
have wrestled with how to distribute the Reflective Safety Bands and track the
impact they have on the roads. After much consultation, trial and error, our
initial plan is to give them away for free at the local markets, churches,
schools, on the streets, etc. We have created explanatory displays in English
and Spanish with rings of 40-60 bands attached and have hung them in many bus
stops, markets, and popular road-side areas. We’ve watched as they disappear
one-by-one and had great feedback so far.
Needless
to say, this method is quite costly. We hope to supplement the costs (currently,
approximately $1.25 / band) through private and corporate donations and
purchases by local business who believe in the Project and want to give them to
their workers. 
Another
option we’ve considered is creating micro-business opportunities for local Tica
women, including our seamstresses. They would receive the bands from the
Collaborative, sell them to their community, and return 50% to the
Collaborative. Hopefully, growth will occur when word of this project spreads to
the surrounding areas and we are able to create opportunities like this in much
of Costa Rica. 

How can you help? 
We are launching this Indiegogo Campaign to ensure the continuation of this Project beyond our current pilot of 3,000 bands. The funds will cover material, printing, paying the seamstresses, and promotional material.  Our goal is to blanket this area with bands as best as we can. We will return to Boston in July and hope to raise enough to leave the Collaborative with the resources to expand and sustain the project. 
Ideally, we'll catch the attention of a sponsor who will keep the project going until there are sidewalks and lights on all the roads around here. 

                        
                     We look forward to driving at night and seeing the road filled                                        with these shining Reflective Safety Bands.
This Project has been a great experience for our kids.  They have been involved with it from the beginning: visiting the homes of the seamstresses, watching and learning about the printing process, filling their suitcases with reflective tape and velcro, and brainstorming with us the various pieces of the puzzle. They are learning what it means to recognize a problem and know that they can be a part of a solution. 
Not only will our kids benefit from this project, but we are working with the high school coordinator at La Paz, our kids' school, to get the 11th and 12th grade students involved as well. 
If we are successful in this geographic area we hope to expand the project further.  Who knows, maybe with your help Proyecto Bandas Reflectantes will grow to cover the whole country, maybe even to other parts of Central America, and beyond. 
We welcome your ideas, feedback, and suggestions.

This is how I try to somehow pay her back in such a small way for ALL that she has done for me. Let me tell you a little bit about that.<br/>  I moved into my grandmothers house when I was 15 and through the past 10 years, this woman has been absolutely everything to me.

She was constantly there for me through all of that, for every near suicide attempt, every breakdown, falter, misstep, and apathetic episode-- she was there. She has guided me through my highs and lows, been the mother I never had, and the best friend I always needed. She'll be yours, too, if you want!!

I have helped as much as I could but, I don't make enough working in retail to help as much as I want.

In our Ello Raw bites we use NO AGAVE. We rely mostly on the natural sweetness of dates. Two of our varieties also use a small amount of raw honey, which amazingly is the only natural sweetener that has other healing and health benefits. The last ""sugar"" we use is a coconut palm sugar which is simply a dusting on our Cinnamon Sugar Donut variety. We want to pull the focus away from sugar and onto whole foods!</li>

We know that education is just as important as our product and we hope to provide information on raw foods and health to all of our customers


Where Will the Funds Go?


Every time we produce we pay for ingredients, packaging, labels and kitchen space. As we secure retailers and larger orders we will use the funds to support the production of orders and building inventory to support retail sales 
As a small start-up we've built ourselves with very little resources and there is much need for improvement. We will use some funds for the branding and marketing necessary to support expansion and our startup

It is important that customers know our credibility and the authenticity of our ingredients. We will be using funds to secure health certifications such as USDA Organic and gluten-free which can be very expensive

A small amount of the funds will go to nutrition testing where we will have our product analyzed to provide better information on the micro and macro nutrients
If we raise enough funds we will be looking into securing a certified Gluten-Free facility to better accommodate those with allergies     What You Get The Perks  Donate anything and receive satisfaction knowing you helped a small startup begin!
Donate $10 and receive a personal thank you note 
Donate $25 and receive a 3-pack of dessert bites (you choose the flavors)

Prikupljamo dodatnih 10 000 dolara, kako bismo u sklopu Buba Bara otvorili i kuglanu. S obzirom da je u prostoru predviđenom za Buba Bar već i ranije postojala kuglana, osim što ćemo zaposliti osobe s invaliditetom, vratit ćemo stari sjaj kuglani i poboljšati društveni život u Vinkovcima.Naši Bubamarci u samo tri dana dostigli su cilj kampanje za uređenje prostora Buba Bara. S obzirom na ovaj uspjeh i preostalih 20 dana kampanja odlučili smo otići korak dalje i prikupiti dodatnih 5000$ kako bi u rad Buba Bara uključili još 5 Bubamaraca!UPOZNAJTE NAŠE BUBAMARCEAlen, Domagoj, Dario, Ivana i Marija već tri mjeseca marljivo vježbaju i bruse svoje vještine kako bi njihov početak rada bio što uspješniji. Spremni su iskazati se i svima pokazati svoje talente, a njihovo uzbuđenje zbog početka rada u Buba Baru teško je prenijeti riječima.Domagoj ima 41 godinu i dosada nije imao priliku raditi. Posao u Buba Baru biti će njegova prva prilika za rad. ''Samo želim raditi i oženiti se'' – kaže Domagoj. To je njegov najveći san, i zapravo nije toliko različit od snova većine ljudi. Ekstra kromosom kavu će učiniti još posebnijom. Domagoj je vrlo vrijedan i želi svojoj obitelji olakšati financijsku situaciju.Ivana dolazi iz Vukovara i ima najljepši kaputić. Voli pjevati, zajedno s Alenom, pa Buba Bar već ima svoje zvijezde u usponu. S njom nema previše rasprave, ako vam slučajno preko usta prođe kakva ''šporka'' riječ budite spremni od Ivane čuti jedan  veliki ''beeeeep''. Ivana je vrlo draga i uvijek nasmijana - pogotovo ako ju Alen škaklja.Alen će vas bez problema upozoriti ukoliko ste popili koju čašicu previše. Obožava pjevati i izvoditi konobarske trikove. Alen radi u stakleniku poljoprivredne škole i rado će vam preporučiti da kupite maćuhice koje je sam uzgojio.Marija ima 21 godinu. Nakon teške prometne nesreće i dugotrajnog oporavka dobila je priliku za svoj prvi posao u Buba Baru. S prvom plaćom želi kupiti auto i počastiti svoje prijatelje.  Najdraža gošća u Buba Baru Mariji će zasigurno biti njena sestra blizanka Katarina.Dario je uistinu fin dečko. Kada je riječ o poslu, vrlo je ozbiljan. ''Najvažniji su red, rad i disciplina'' – kaže Dario. Usprkos ozbiljnosti u poslu, voli se šaliti i htio bi imati djevojku, ako je moguće stariju. Ako se pitate zašto, dođite na kavu i osobno ga pitajte za šankom!To su naši ''Bubamarci'' – budući zaposlenici Buba Bara. Od ukupno 500 000 osoba s invaliditetom u Hrvatskoj, samo 2.4% je zaposleno.
Alen, Domagoj, Dario, Ivana i Marija prvi će dobiti priliku raditi u Buba Baru!
Jeste li ikada upoznali osobu s Downovim sindromom i osjetili toplinu njihova srca? Mi vjerujemo da su osobe s Downovim sindromom divni zaspolenici koji mogu doprinijeti poslu ako im se pruži prilika. I s ekstra kromosomom napraviti ekstra kavu!Naša je misija poboljšati kvalitetu života osoba s invaliditetom, te potaknuti društvo da osobe s invaliditetom prihvati kao svoje ravnopravne članove.Želimo da Buba Bar probije led, i da uskoro svaki grad u Hrvatskoj ima svoj Buba Bar! Želimo mladima s invaliditetom pružiti priliku da žive život kao i svi ostali ljudi. Želimo da budu u mogućnosti raditi.Što nam je potrebno?Potencijal kafića Buba Bar prepoznala je i Gradska uprava, te nam je na korištenje dala atraktivan prostor u centru grada veličine 500 četvornih metara kojeg prethodno treba adaptirati.Kao neprofitna organizacija financijska sredstva nismo u mogućnosti osigurati, stoga smo pokrenuli kampanju za njihovo prikupljanje. Kako bi Buba Bar čim prije stavili u funkciju potrebno nam je 10.000 dolara.Kompletan iznos prikupljenih donacija uložiti ćemo u uređenje i opremanje prostora koji će u potpunosti biti prilagođen osobama s invaliditetom, a ugodan ambijent pružit će i široj lokalnoj zajednici mogućnost za kvalitetnim druženjem i zajedničkim aktivnostima.Koja je vaša uloga u otvaranju Buba Bara?Kafić „Buba Bara“ biti će mjesto najkvalitetnije kave  - kave servirane s posebnim osmijehom, mjesto koja će etablirati i na prvo mjesto ponovno vratiti osnovno ljudsko pravo -  pravo na rad.Buba Bar je za Bubamarce ispunjenje njihovih snova, prilika da pokažu koliko vrijede i koliko su spremni biti ravnopravnim dijelom društva.Želimo da podržite ovu ideju i uvijek ostanete naši vjerni gosti..VREMENSKI TIJEK NAŠEG RADA            Budite uz naše Bubamarce!„Buba Bar“ je projekt Udruge osoba s invaliditetom „Bubamara“ iz Vinkovaca iza kojeg stoji 1495 članova udruge. Pomozite nam da stvorimo mjesto jednakih mogućnosti za sve - nas sa one, i vas s druge strane šanka.Hvala!*****Meet ours Bubamars!Alen, Domagoj, Dario, Ivana and  Marija are intensively practicing, for three months, to sharpen and polish their skills for a more successful start of work.

<p><span>We are <a href=""http://www.letsgetfarming.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rise &amp; Root Farm</a>! We are farmers, educators, community organizers and food entrepreneurs with deep roots in New York City and an unwavering commitment to engaging rural and urban communities through food and farming.  Collectively we have decades of farming and gardening experience, both rural and in the city. We are committed  to increasing opportunities for all people to grow and eat good food. </span></p>
<p>The six of us came together with a common dream to continue our food justice work by growing food, building community, and creating a healing, nurturing place for ourselves and others.  This year we’re breaking ground and starting a new farm on 3 acres of land in the Black Dirt Region of Orange County New York!</p>
<p>To make this dream come true, we need your support.  </p>
<p></p> </div> <div>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Through Indiegogo, we hope to raise part of our start up costs to ensure we have a solid foundation and the tools we need to begin a successful operation. We plan on working hard and just as importantly, being smart about how we use our time. Many of our start up costs are tools that will make our work more efficient, including a two wheeled tractor with implements, weeding equipment (a real need in the fertile black dirt!), and greenhouse supplies. We also have location-specific needs like a pump, which is essential to prevent flooding. Our campaign goal is $50,000, which will help us meet more of our financial needs. </span></p>

<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>We have some great perks available to thank you for your contribution to our campaign. Everyone who donates $25 or more will receive a customized farm refrigerator magnet and special donor listing on our website.  Additional perks include plenty of opportunities to visit our farm, benefits from the farm's bounty and a chance to have a special farm item named after you! Supporting our campaign also gives you bragging rights forever - the chance to say “you were there when they got started.”  And most importantly, your contribution is a chance to feel great about the fact that you are making a real difference in growing the roots of our farm and helping us continue the work that we are doing. </span></p>

Among our farmers are founders, graduates and teachers of New York City’s <a href=""http://www.farmschoolnyc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.farmschoolnyc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Farm School NYC</a>, four graduates of the internationally acclaimed Ecological Horticulture Apprenticeship program at the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (<a href=""http://casfs.ucsc.edu/apprenticeship/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CASFS</a>), a 2014 <a href=""http://www.jamesbeard.org/awards/leadership/karen-washington"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.jamesbeard.org/awards/leadership/karen-washington"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">James Beard Leadership Award</a> recipient, two former directors of NYC urban farming non-profits, and the Founder and Chef of <a href=""http://www.crockandjar.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.crockandjar.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crock &amp; Jar</a>.  In 2012, our whole farm team participated in <a href=""http://www.grownyc.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.grownyc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grow NYC</a>'s <a href=""http://www.grownyc.org/farmroots"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.grownyc.org/farmroots/beginnings"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Farm Beginnings</a> program, developing our farm vision and building the foundation of our business plan. With our collective knowledge, skills and experiences of working with food from seed to table, we are excited to create a farm that will reflect our values for growing ethically and sustainably on the land while providing healthy food to our communities and growing our local food economy.  </p>
<p>Part of our farm plan includes the already existing company, <a href=""http://www.crockandjar.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.crockandjar.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.crockandjar.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crock &amp; Jar</a>. Crock &amp; Jar is a value-added and food preservation company focused on supporting local farmers while sharing the craft of fermenting and preserving foods. In 2015, Rise &amp; Root Farm will provide crops for Crock &amp; Jar’s products, and Crock &amp; Jar will develop new products based on our farm’s specialties.</p>
<p>As a group, we wear our farmer hats with very clear intentions about our farming practices, building healthy relationships with both the land and with our community partners. Rise &amp; Root Farm will serve as an education site for current partners in New York City and the local community, providing workshops and volunteer opportunities once we are established. To increase opportunities for people to have a more holistic farm experience, at some point in the future, we will also offer overnight farm stays for visitors.</p>
Finally our farm group is made up of women and includes people of color and LGBTQ people. We are proud of who we are and what we want to accomplish. Historically, all of the above mentioned groups have been discriminated against and had to fight for many of the rights that we benefit from today. We will always remember to honor our foremothers for their strength, resiliency and determination to rise above these challenges. By starting Rise &amp; Root Farm, we are creating a welcoming and safe space where people are free to be themselves.</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">

</div></div>","Summary


 
We are Rise & Root Farm! We are farmers, educators, community organizers and food entrepreneurs with deep roots in New York City and an unwavering commitment to engaging rural and urban communities through food and farming.  Collectively we have decades of farming and gardening experience, both rural and in the city. We are committed  to increasing opportunities for all people to grow and eat good food. 
The six of us came together with a common dream to continue our food justice work by growing food, building community, and creating a healing, nurturing place for ourselves and others.  This year we’re breaking ground and starting a new farm on 3 acres of land in the Black Dirt Region of Orange County New York!
To make this dream come true, we need your support.  
  

Through Indiegogo, we hope to raise part of our start up costs to ensure we have a solid foundation and the tools we need to begin a successful operation. We plan on working hard and just as importantly, being smart about how we use our time. Many of our start up costs are tools that will make our work more efficient, including a two wheeled tractor with implements, weeding equipment (a real need in the fertile black dirt!), and greenhouse supplies. We also have location-specific needs like a pump, which is essential to prevent flooding. Our campaign goal is $50,000, which will help us meet more of our financial needs. 





We have some great perks available to thank you for your contribution to our campaign. Everyone who donates $25 or more will receive a customized farm refrigerator magnet and special donor listing on our website.  Additional perks include plenty of opportunities to visit our farm, benefits from the farm's bounty and a chance to have a special farm item named after you! Supporting our campaign also gives you bragging rights forever - the chance to say “you were there when they got started.”  And most importantly, your contribution is a chance to feel great about the fact that you are making a real difference in growing the roots of our farm and helping us continue the work that we are doing. 







Who we are

We are Rise & Root Farm! Among our farmers are founders, graduates and teachers of New York City’s Farm School NYC, four graduates of the internationally acclaimed Ecological Horticulture Apprenticeship program at the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), a 2014 James Beard Leadership Award recipient, two former directors of NYC urban farming non-profits, and the Founder and Chef of Crock & Jar.  In 2012, our whole farm team participated in Grow NYC's Farm Beginnings program, developing our farm vision and building the foundation of our business plan. With our collective knowledge, skills and experiences of working with food from seed to table, we are excited to create a farm that will reflect our values for growing ethically and sustainably on the land while providing healthy food to our communities and growing our local food economy.  
Part of our farm plan includes the already existing company, Crock & Jar. Crock & Jar is a value-added and food preservation company focused on supporting local farmers while sharing the craft of fermenting and preserving foods. In 2015, Rise & Root Farm will provide crops for Crock & Jar’s products, and Crock & Jar will develop new products based on our farm’s specialties.
As a group, we wear our farmer hats with very clear intentions about our farming practices, building healthy relationships with both the land and with our community partners. Rise & Root Farm will serve as an education site for current partners in New York City and the local community, providing workshops and volunteer opportunities once we are established. To increase opportunities for people to have a more holistic farm experience, at some point in the future, we will also offer overnight farm stays for visitors.
Finally our farm group is made up of women and includes people of color and LGBTQ people. We are proud of who we are and what we want to accomplish. Historically, all of the above mentioned groups have been discriminated against and had to fight for many of the rights that we benefit from today. We will always remember to honor our foremothers for their strength, resiliency and determination to rise above these challenges. By starting Rise & Root Farm, we are creating a welcoming and safe space where people are free to be themselves.

    Risks & Challenges  
Some of you may be familiar with the challenges that come with farming: unpredictable weather (droughts, hurricanes, floods), increasing land prices, demanding physical labor, and low wages, just to name a few. We are determined to make the farm succeed, be profitable and pay ourselves a living wage, while continuing to provide food to and collaborate with underserved communities. We realize that we are stronger together than individually.  By farming as a cooperative, each of us brings individual skills and experience that fortifies our collective efforts.On top of that, we’re crossing what feels like a great divide of moving from the city to the country.  Several of us have lived in NYC for decades, some a lifetime.

<h3>Why Should You Care?</h3>
<p>Young-Williams is a local shelter in Knoxville that helps all kinds of animals and families everyday. During such an unprecedented time of COVID-19 our furry friends have always been by our side and have helped so many of us get through these difficult times. Every year, Young-Williams is faced with thousands of animals needing treatment such as spay and neuter surgeries, behavioral help, unpredicted surgeries, and other accommodations. Animals within this shelter depend on community donations and grant funding to make what Young-Williams does happen every day. This wouldn’t be possible without the care, treatment, and accessibility Young-Williams Animal Center has given to the people of Knoxville.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Are the Benefits of Donating to Young-Williams?</h3>
<p>Donating towards the “Wags to Riches” campaign not only helps a local non-profit animal shelter, but also gives hope to the many people involved with Young-Williams. However you donate, you are helping Young-Williams to become one step closer to their goals. With each donation, our furry friends are one step closer to finding their forever homes. The money donated also keeps the shelter open, which allows for more animals to receive care. There are many benefits for you as well! These benefits include choosing from our many perks, and knowing that you helped out a few furry friends!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615979802/kdnknbdlxoqf07dcrjec.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Your Money Goes Towards</h3>
<p>All donations that are received will go directly to Young-Williams to help them provide quality care to all of their animals. This money will help the shelter buy anything they need to help maintain and keep the shelter open including food, beds, and necessary treatments. These furry friends need your help to live their best lives and find their forever homes! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren’t able to donate money to our campaign, don’t worry because there are other ways you can help! Young-Williams has many volunteer opportunities, so if you are willing to spare some time to help these furry animals you can do that. Young-Williams also has a fostering program where you can look after dogs or cats temporarily. They also accept almost any type of donation such as food and blankets. Young-Williams has many more ways you can help and support these animals listed on their website, so if you are interested take a look!</p>

During such an unprecedented time of COVID-19 our furry friends have always been by our side and have helped so many of us get through these difficult times. Every year, Young-Williams is faced with thousands of animals needing treatment such as spay and neuter surgeries, behavioral help, unpredicted surgeries, and other accommodations. Animals within this shelter depend on community donations and grant funding to make what Young-Williams does happen every day. This wouldn’t be possible without the care, treatment, and accessibility Young-Williams Animal Center has given to the people of Knoxville.
 
What Are the Benefits of Donating to Young-Williams?
Donating towards the “Wags to Riches” campaign not only helps a local non-profit animal shelter, but also gives hope to the many people involved with Young-Williams. However you donate, you are helping Young-Williams to become one step closer to their goals. With each donation, our furry friends are one step closer to finding their forever homes. The money donated also keeps the shelter open, which allows for more animals to receive care. There are many benefits for you as well! These benefits include choosing from our many perks, and knowing that you helped out a few furry friends!

 
What Your Money Goes Towards
All donations that are received will go directly to Young-Williams to help them provide quality care to all of their animals. This money will help the shelter buy anything they need to help maintain and keep the shelter open including food, beds, and necessary treatments. These furry friends need your help to live their best lives and find their forever homes! 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you aren’t able to donate money to our campaign, don’t worry because there are other ways you can help! Young-Williams has many volunteer opportunities, so if you are willing to spare some time to help these furry animals you can do that. Young-Williams also has a fostering program where you can look after dogs or cats temporarily. They also accept almost any type of donation such as food and blankets. Young-Williams has many more ways you can help and support these animals listed on their website, so if you are interested take a look!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

fresh bevanda (drink) and a bowl of pasta.

I have been working in the restaurant setting since I was 16  years old. Cooking and being with people is my passion!  I can't think of anything better than this wonderful opportunity! I want to share my passion with my team. I hope to find great people that will work with me and that will help me give the customers that awesome experience!If you can't contribute, please help me get the word out and make some noise about my campaign!Grazie milleDanielae-mail me at mammarosa2014@gmail.com for any questions!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>""Green"" Wine Tours in Sonoma and Napa</h3>
<p><i>The mission of <b><a href=""http://www.obsidiantours.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Obsidian Wine Tours</b></a></b> is to connect wine lovers and vintners with a shared passion for the land, stewardship, and equity; provide accurate information about sustainability and natural, organic, and biodynamic grape growing and winemaking; and of course, to share distinctive wines. </i></p>
<h3>Who, Why and What</h3>
<div>
<em><b></b><p><b><a href=""http://www.obsidiantours.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Obsidian Wine Tours</a> </b>is the brainchild of Anna Brittain, a Napa Valley native. <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/697469/files/20140706110932-Anna___Lily.jpg?1404670172"" src="""" style=""width: 191px; height: 191px;""/></p></em>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>The only child of a single mother, Anna worked hard to secure a scholarship to Williams College in Massachusetts where she graduated with a double major in Political Science &amp; Environmental Studies. She then spent a decade doing environmental management and policy work on every level from local to international, including climate policy in Vietnam and Switzerland, as well as four years working in the U.S. with <a href=""http://www.viewcraft.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><b>ViewCraft</b></span></a>  as a sustainability consultant for wineries and state and regional wine organizations. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 2011, Anna received her <a href=""http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/MESM.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Master of Environmental Science and Management</span></a> from the Bren School at UC Santa Barbara. And most recently, managed the <a href=""http://www.rff.org/centers/management_of_ecological_wealth/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Center for the Management of Ecological Wealth</a> at the environmental economics think tank <a href=""http://www.rff.org/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><b>Resources for the Future</b></span></a> in Washington, DC. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After realizing that she wanted to leave the world of policy making and become more personally involved in her field of expertise, Anna made a bold decision. She returned to the Napa Valley to develop a business that would actively capitalize on her unique knowledge of sustainability within the wine industry, build relationships with progressive wine leaders, and directly educate people one “green” wine tour at a time!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>At this juncture, Anna is poised to tap a growing market niche but she genuinely needs your help to make it happen!! </p>

The mission of Obsidian Wine Tours is to connect wine lovers and vintners with a shared passion for the land, stewardship, and equity; provide accurate information about sustainability and natural, organic, and biodynamic grape growing and winemaking; and of course, to share distinctive wines. 
Who, Why and What

Obsidian Wine Tours is the brainchild of Anna Brittain, a Napa Valley native. 



The only child of a single mother, Anna worked hard to secure a scholarship to Williams College in Massachusetts where she graduated with a double major in Political Science & Environmental Studies. She then spent a decade doing environmental management and policy work on every level from local to international, including climate policy in Vietnam and Switzerland, as well as four years working in the U.S. with ViewCraft  as a sustainability consultant for wineries and state and regional wine organizations. 


In 2011, Anna received her Master of Environmental Science and Management from the Bren School at UC Santa Barbara. And most recently, managed the Center for the Management of Ecological Wealth at the environmental economics think tank Resources for the Future in Washington, DC. 


After realizing that she wanted to leave the world of policy making and become more personally involved in her field of expertise, Anna made a bold decision. She returned to the Napa Valley to develop a business that would actively capitalize on her unique knowledge of sustainability within the wine industry, build relationships with progressive wine leaders, and directly educate people one “green” wine tour at a time!


At this juncture, Anna is poised to tap a growing market niche but she genuinely needs your help to make it happen!! 






This isn't just a chauffeur service - Anna serves as a local friend and guide who engages guests in a dialogue about what the heck it means for a wine to be sustainable, natural, organic, biodynamic, and everything in between. Obsidian Wine Tours gets visitors past the commercial veneer and off the beaten track to meet artisan winegrowers and winemakers and have down-to-earth conversations about making wines that are truly an expression of place. 






I want to introduce visitors to the heart and soul of wine country – to smaller-scale producers and family farmers who make stunning wines using a holistic approach, investing in healthy soils and a diverse environment.

Obsidian Wine Tours will be unique in three ways:



First, no one else in this region is offering this type of boutique
tour with an environmental specialist visiting progressive vineyards and wineries. 


Second, Anna isn't just dropping people off – she's actually joining visitors throughout the day to help answers questions
and participate in discussions.


And third, Anna can provide a picnic lunch sourced from local farmers, cheesemakers,
and other producers! She can even make local food a part of the tour!


There is more and more evidence that consumers are interested in learning about and purchasing “green” wine. And there are quite a few meaningful sustainability certification programs for both vineyards and wineries. Here in California there is broad participation in state, regional, and local programs. But very few wineries are talking about the great things they're doing and helping consumers understand their motivations and how these conscientious practices can influence the wines. 
Obsidian Wine Tours will help
address this disconnect by helping wineries be broader educators, making sure their employees and customers
know about their environmentally and socially progressive practices. 





   Your Contribution at Work Anna needs to raise a minimum of $5,000. This crowdfunding support will fund several regulatory, networking, and marketing needs:  

Anna has already invested over $2,000 in the unique charter party livery insurance necessary to secure the TCP-S permit from the California Public Utilities Commission, but she needs another $2,000 to fully fund this huge expense.
Your support will also enable Anna to join three Chambers of Commerce - Napa, Sonoma, and Healdsburg - expanding the networking and marketing reach for Obsidian Wine Tours.
Finally, your contribution will allow Anna to participate in the Napa Chamber of Commerce's Business Expo, the largest annual business expo in the Napa Valley, and the Napa Valley Grapegrower's Rootstock conference, building strategic relationships and foundational business for Obsidian Wine Tours! 

Anna's ultimate goal is to raise $8,000, making it possible for her to pursue broader networking and marketing during the critical business launch phase, including exhibiting at targeted Bay Area events (e.g. the Green Festival, Bioneers Summit Conference), and ensuring she can participate in the Unified Wine & Grape Symposium and Women of the Vine Global Symposium. 

The Perks of Getting on Board!
Anna has designed some great benefits for each level of support! 


Anna is a photographer and she will send you a selection of 10 wine country photographs to choose from, then send you a fabulous print! The premium metallic finish gives photos an amazing vibrance and saturation!







For contributions of $120 or more you can snag ""Anna's Insider Guide to Boutique Green Wineries with STELLAR Wines in Napa & Sonoma,"" and choose a bamboo or organic cotton Obsidian Wine Tours ""Wine S.N.O.B"" t-shirt or tote bag. 






Or you can up your contribution to $400, get the above benefits, AND come on an Obsidian Wine tour!! Have friends or family who might join you? Consider the $600 or $800 contribution levels! Anna will definitely be a new friend by the end of the day!
For the ultimate custom green wine experience go for the Salmanazar Level (Salmanazar refers to a 9.0L bottle of wine - equivalent to 12 standard 750 mL bottles or a case of wine!). Anna will curate TWELVE spectacular bottles of wine based on your preferences and travel to you to provide a personal wine tasting soiree for you and up to 14 guests!

Barnabas 
    Clothing Co. is a positive lifestyle brand 
    that gives a portion of each sale to The Living Room International in Kipkaren, 
    Kenya. Barnabas Clothing Co. encourages all of those who wear our clothes 
    to boldly live A Life Worth Imitating. We give a portion of all of our sales 
    to The Living Room because we think their staff embodies that statement. We 
    believe that everyone should use their lives to impact the world around them 
    for good. We here at Barnabas Clothing Co. are taking up our own challenge, 
    and traveling overseas to Kenya to serve the staff and community of the Living 
    Room.
 




































Our 
  team consists of Founder/CEO/President, Alexander Aquino, Co-owner/Vice President 
  Julie Pocino, educators/writers, and a videographer. The members of our team 
  all have a heart to serve others and love working with kids, and they bring 
  their years of experience, passion, and excitement to give back to community.

























































The 
    Living Room International is a non-profit organization based in Western 
    Kenya that provides comprehensive care to those men, women and children living 
    with HIV/AIDS and other life threatening illnesses. They are a community that 
    honors life and offers hope and they do so by becoming family to those who are dying. The organization has a 26 bed inpatient hospice facility that allows 
    them to provide compassionate medical, emotional and spiritual support for 
    the patient in their final days of life. The environment and atmosphere is 
    that of a home - everyone is welcome, everyone is loved, and everyone belongs. 
    No one is left to face their pain or fears alone. Outside of the facility, 
    the staff also makes home visits, bringing critical care and compassion to 
    house-bound patients. In addition to hospice care, the Living Room is a training 
    institute on HIV/AIDS prevention and in collaboration with other organizations 
    provides education and resources to the surrounding community. 
Barnabas 
    Clothing is inspired by the work the Living Room International organization 
    continues to do in Kenya. We see their compassion, their dedication, and their 
    commitment to hope, even in the face of suffering and death, as extraordinary. 
    They are truly modeling A Life Worth Imitating. The Barnabas team would 
    like to encourage the staff and share their story. Our time in Kenya will 
    be spent serving and helping the staff at The Living Room, as well as running 
    after school programs for the children in the community.
 























Backpacks
  The community where The Living Room is located in Kipkaren, has a great deal 
  of children. Funds and supplies are much more limited there for children to 
  get the resources they need for school. We will be supplying each child we work 
  work with a backpack that contains all of the necessary school supplies for 
  a year of education. 
Funds 
    to run activities
    We will have to purchase the supplies for the after school activities that 
    we organize and run for the children in the Kipkaren community. Some of these 
    activities will be educational work, and others will be sports and games. 
    We would like to leave all resources and supplies there with the community 
    for the children to continue to use after we leave.
Funds 
    to help the Barnabas team travel to Kenya
    Any funds that we raise above the cost of the backpacks and purchasing supplies 
    for children will go to help our team pay for travel expenses to get to Kenya, 
    as well as the extra fees associated with bringing the backpacks to the children. 
    All of our team members will be giving their own time and finances to travel 
    to Kenya. We are hoping to raise above and beyond our budget to help team 
    members pay for the expensive airfare and travel to Kenya, as well as give 
    extra funds to The Living Room.

<p>In fact the closest Tesla Dealership is 4 hours away in Chicago.

<h3>Sending Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>For a couple of years now I have been following several organizations in their global relief efforts with tsunami, earthquake, typhoon, and other natural disasters. It is devastating to watch these events take place and see the amount of destruction that can happen from a natural disaster.</p>
<p>What's more amazing is to see groups of selfless people come from around the world to help and respond to such events. They volunteer their time and efforts to rebuild these areas.</p>
<p>I believe I can go and help contribute. I am currently applying to volunteer for Project Cagayan de Oro and want to help families rebuild their homes.</p>
</div>

<h3>Project Cagayan de Oro - Typhoon Washi</h3>
<p>The island of Mindanao was hit by Typhoon Washi back in 2011. Several organizations have sent relief efforts to rebuild the nearly 50,000 homes that were destroyed.</p>

<div><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Our food system is broken.</b>  And most of the damage is done in the form of fast food.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The food world has never been more celebrated, and yet at the same time, we're feeding our children corrosive chemical waste.   Food science can be used for wonderful, creative, nutritious, delightful creations.  But put in the wrong hands, the same science can be used for wrong -- getting people psychologically and physically addicted to just the worst quality, terribly sourced, straight harmful food.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This kind of fast food is the only viable options in the growing food desserts of America.  And it's not just a problem for the communities on the ""wrong"" side of the tracks.  Even some of the toniest suburbs of America are defined by their rows and rows of chain restaurants.</p>
<blockquote style=""text-align: left;""><b>Bad food—the empty-calorie, industrial-farmed, processed-everything-Value-Meal-Family-Deal—hurts everyone, yet it’s the most ubiquitous restaurant option out there. It exacts a toll on the planet, including on the people who make and consume it. It is not actually cheap.</b></blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We didn't eat like this just two generations ago.  Our grandparents' generation, they ate read food.  But now this is who we've become.  We've been brainwashed.  And our whole diet has become polluted.  </p>

<h2>The LocoL Vision</h2>
<div><br/></div>
<span style=""text-align: left;"">
<p><strong>Our vision</strong> with LocoL is to create a fast food concept that's delicious, but do it with the heart of a chef.  As chefs, we're approaching it just like we would another restaurant - design, function, systems, fee and costs, organizations, sourcing, product, farmers, ingredients, recipes, training, all that stuff.  Then on the other side of it is being very aware of what fast food is and what it's become in America, and why it's so important, popular, and powerful. Not trying to throw all of those things away.</p>
<p>The inspiration for LocoL came from our previous cooking efforts.  Daniel started a non-profit, <a href=""http://thecookingproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>The Cooking Project</strong></a>, to offer free classes, teaching young people how to cook and the value of gathering around the table.  While volunteering and teaching people from the streets how to cook good food inexpensively, and the value of gathering around the table.  So many of the kids had subsisted their whole lives on processed food, and it was a revelation to see how positively they responded to real food that they made themselves.  </p>

<p>As much as thoughtful articles, books, and speeches are important in shifting how we think, they are not going to solve the food problems we have in our country. Our government certainly won’t solve them either. We have to act if we want change. If we can open profitable restaurants that are inexpensive and serve delicious food made with real ingredients; if we bring new options to places that currently lack quality food; if we cook with heart; if we create an environment of warmth, generosity, and caring; and if we value the people with less money just as much as the ones with plenty, we can make a difference.</p>

</div></div>","We're open! Come say hi and browse our merch at --> www.welocol.com3/17 Update: We did it! Thank u all so much.  Time to get to work and make it real.  The revolution has begun! We still got time so spread the word. Amazing.  THANK YOU!___________________________________________________________________________Welcome to LocoL. We're chefs Roy Choi (Kogi BBQ) and Daniel Patterson (Coi SF), and we want you to join us in tackling the fast food industry.  
LocoL is about real fast food made with the heart of a chef.  That's where we start.  And we're opening our first first two locations in LA Watts and San Francisco Tenderloin. 
We fundamentally believe that wholesomeness, deliciousness and affordability don't have to be mutually exclusive concepts in fast food.   We believe that fast food restaurants can truly empower the communities they currently underserve. We believe that the giant corporate force that feeds most of America has degraded from decades of suits maximizing profits.  We believe that chefs should feed America, and not suits.  
In short, we're aiming to revolutionize the fast food industry as we know it in America.  It's going to be long, difficult and damn near impossible journey.  If that doesn't scare you, this is where we take the first step.
Welcome to the revolution.

Here's the Problem

Our food system is broken.  And most of the damage is done in the form of fast food.
The food world has never been more celebrated, and yet at the same time, we're feeding our children corrosive chemical waste.   Food science can be used for wonderful, creative, nutritious, delightful creations.  But put in the wrong hands, the same science can be used for wrong -- getting people psychologically and physically addicted to just the worst quality, terribly sourced, straight harmful food.
This kind of fast food is the only viable options in the growing food desserts of America.  And it's not just a problem for the communities on the ""wrong"" side of the tracks.  Even some of the toniest suburbs of America are defined by their rows and rows of chain restaurants.
Bad food—the empty-calorie, industrial-farmed, processed-everything-Value-Meal-Family-Deal—hurts everyone, yet it’s the most ubiquitous restaurant option out there. It exacts a toll on the planet, including on the people who make and consume it. It is not actually cheap.
We didn't eat like this just two generations ago.  Our grandparents' generation, they ate read food.  But now this is who we've become.  We've been brainwashed.  And our whole diet has become polluted.  
But it doesn't have to be this way...  



__________________________________
The LocoL Vision


Our vision with LocoL is to create a fast food concept that's delicious, but do it with the heart of a chef.  As chefs, we're approaching it just like we would another restaurant - design, function, systems, fee and costs, organizations, sourcing, product, farmers, ingredients, recipes, training, all that stuff.  Then on the other side of it is being very aware of what fast food is and what it's become in America, and why it's so important, popular, and powerful. Not trying to throw all of those things away.
The inspiration for LocoL came from our previous cooking efforts.  Daniel started a non-profit, The Cooking Project, to offer free classes, teaching young people how to cook and the value of gathering around the table.  While volunteering and teaching people from the streets how to cook good food inexpensively, and the value of gathering around the table.  So many of the kids had subsisted their whole lives on processed food, and it was a revelation to see how positively they responded to real food that they made themselves.  
Then he met Roy, co-founder of Kogi—food trucks that serve tasty, hard-to-categorize food.  As Kogi’s reputation and success grew, so did Roy’s drive to feed more people. He began opening brick and mortar places that improved their communities, like 3 Worlds Cafe, a fruit and juice bar in South Central.
They laid the foundation for a new fast food concept, and announced it to a cheering audience of fellow chefs last August at MAD4 Symposium.  Full video here:

Tackling Fast Food

People love a Big Mac, people love a Quarter Pounder, people love KFC and Church's and Popeye's. People love that. It doesn't help if we're going to just try to say, ""Don't eat any of that stuff.""


We can sit here and blast all day long about fast food, but the fact is they're winning. 

It would be ignorant and stupid of us to not acknowledge and understand all that. LocoL is a small bridge; to use the familiar to our advantage to bridge us over to healthier, wholesome ways.  
We're just trying to take it back to basics. A lot of these fast food chains weren't evil before.  Somehow along the line as businesses grow, money and things start to change your decisions. Then before you know it, sometimes you don't know which way is up anymore. Our philosophy in this is to always know which way is up.  As chefs, we would never get to the point where we would be serving poison to people. 
Maybe by creating our own business, we can exist side-by-side, so even if they won’t listen we can work as a competitor to make them listen. We can create real change, in this case by building a better business.

The LocoL Menu



LocoL Burger, Tartine Bun, and ""Chicken Nugs"" with Chef Daniel's awesome sauce.

We know that the cornerstone of the American fast food chain is the burger and the sandwich and the fried items. We're going to take a look at all of that and dissect it and then revisit it. So the first example of that is our burger. How do we take that burger and not make it a gourmet burger, make it a burger that feels, tastes, looks, smells, and sits in your hand just like a Quarter Pounder.
Chad Robertson of Tartine will help us bake the bread. Chad makes the best bread in America and for LocoL he'll make a bun that is soft and squishy just like the fast food bun.  
We're taking each element and breaking it apart and asking ourselves, How can we find the price point, but challenge the status quo? The burger — cutting it with grains and the tofu — is finding a way because we don't have the power to get our meat at the same prices that these chains do yet.

I am very passionate about the plight of children in some parts of Africa who are falsely accused of witchcraft. These stigmatised children are beaten, tortured and maimed before being ostracised from their homes. Some of these kids are rescued (Thank God) by charitable organizations such as CRARN in Eket and given shelter while others roam the streets . However, the government of Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria felt that by exposing this ugly practices to the outside world, the ""state's image is being damaged"" and therefore has clampdown on the charity organizations that take care of these children, it also has driven  most funding sources away, thereby drying up funds for the up keep of these children. This has resulted in children roaming the streets and scavenging for food in trash bins and exposing themselves to child predators and pedafiles.  More than 450 children were rescued to the CRARN centre and almost 300 reunited with families after an exhaustive counselling session with a signed undertaking by the parents/caretakers to protect the children. 
Bacause these abuses are still going on, we are determined more than ever to do whatever we can to continue the rescue and protection of these children from both thier ill informed parents/caretakers and the government. Most people harm their children out of ignorance by believing that children are the source of their bad omen through witchcraft. Our desire is to carry out advocacy and enlightenment campaign in the communities to get the people educated enough to understand that children are not witches and can/will not harm them or any individual through the use of spiritual or magical powers. Advocacy and enlightenment campaigns will be done on a weekly basis, including monthly townhall meetings, to dissuade parents and family members from ostracising or torturing their children through exocism or whatever guise.
UNICEF reported that there are about 10,000 children accused of witchcraft in Akwa Ibom alone, while UK channel 4 TV reports that more than 15,000 child witch stigmatized children exist in Cross River and Akwa Ibom States combined. With poor quality of education, the number of stigmatized children is growing. There are mushroom underground shelters scharttered all over the state without adequate support for  the rescued children, we would like to support these shelters through your support. CRARN shelter has a functional borehole provided by the Latter Day-Saints Charities, a multipurpose complex which comprises of the girls hostel, dinning room, counselling area and a mini kitchen provided by UNICEF and Zenith Bank. A hostel for the boys and play ground is also available. All these structures are crumbling if they are not continously maintained, your support will make a difference in maitaining this shelter as well.
There is an urgent need to rush several items in support of these children, with just 67 cents a day or $20 a month for each child, we can vigorously address the different issues involve in the child witch saga and save these children from being falsely accused, tortured and even killed. We will send you photos of the child or children you are affecting positvely by your generous support.</div>","My name is Chris Oduok and I am from Akwa Ibom state, one of the 36 states in Nigeria.

This has resulted in children roaming the streets and scavenging for food in trash bins and exposing themselves to child predators and pedafiles.  More than 450 children were rescued to the CRARN centre and almost 300 reunited with families after an exhaustive counselling session with a signed undertaking by the parents/caretakers to protect the children. 
Bacause these abuses are still going on, we are determined more than ever to do whatever we can to continue the rescue and protection of these children from both thier ill informed parents/caretakers and the government. Most people harm their children out of ignorance by believing that children are the source of their bad omen through witchcraft. Our desire is to carry out advocacy and enlightenment campaign in the communities to get the people educated enough to understand that children are not witches and can/will not harm them or any individual through the use of spiritual or magical powers. Advocacy and enlightenment campaigns will be done on a weekly basis, including monthly townhall meetings, to dissuade parents and family members from ostracising or torturing their children through exocism or whatever guise.
UNICEF reported that there are about 10,000 children accused of witchcraft in Akwa Ibom alone, while UK channel 4 TV reports that more than 15,000 child witch stigmatized children exist in Cross River and Akwa Ibom States combined. With poor quality of education, the number of stigmatized children is growing. There are mushroom underground shelters scharttered all over the state without adequate support for  the rescued children, we would like to support these shelters through your support. CRARN shelter has a functional borehole provided by the Latter Day-Saints Charities, a multipurpose complex which comprises of the girls hostel, dinning room, counselling area and a mini kitchen provided by UNICEF and Zenith Bank. A hostel for the boys and play ground is also available. All these structures are crumbling if they are not continously maintained, your support will make a difference in maitaining this shelter as well.
There is an urgent need to rush several items in support of these children, with just 67 cents a day or $20 a month for each child, we can vigorously address the different issues involve in the child witch saga and save these children from being falsely accused, tortured and even killed. We will send you photos of the child or children you are affecting positvely by your generous support.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Bradley Findeis. I'm 24 years old. Recently I've been applying for jobs and realized how horrible it is and how painful the process is. What I've done is thought of a killer good idea that will allow anyone and everyone to apply for jobs online in a more effective and enjoyable way.</p>
<p>Resumateme.com is going to be the go to website to get job applications done faster and more effective. If you have applied for jobs lately you know what I'm talking about. You have roughly 75 fields (i.e. work history, references, education, personal information, etc....) that are the exact information the previous application asked for. By the time you finish all that boring information you hardly have the patience to write a good cover letter, which is your key to at least getting an interview.</p>
<p>What resumateme.com would do would be to store your resume on your profile and allow you to<strong> click and drag</strong> the correct information into the correct field on your application. This would save you oodles of time and frustration. Doing this will allow the person to focus on what matters most, their cover letter.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need roughly $550.00 to get all the web development done. Anything helps! I would really like to just simply get a functioning version up and running. By doing so I'll be able to collect a lot of consumer data and be able to change and tweak it exactly how you want it to work. All I need is the funding to get my idea off the ground and into the world.</p>
<p>Anything helps! If you can't put down some big bucks no worries, a dollar will end up helping me out a ton to get this project off the ground and helping people everywhere apply for jobs.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The way economists view unemployment is; anyone who is actively seeking a job. That means that there are people in this world who are NOT actively seeking jobs. Economists call those people ""discouraged workers.""</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are a lot of discouraged workers and unemployed in the world. I'm not saying that the application process is why there are so many discouraged workers or unemployed but, what I am saying is that if the process was easier, faster, and more efficient, maybe we can help bring that number down.</p>
<p>This isn't just a product i think would be useful and I could make money on. This is something I would love to use. That being said i think it would be very beneficial for anyone to use as well. </p>

<p>My name is Kaati and I
live in Westminster, CO just north of Denver. As a recovering victim of sexual
assault, I'm committed to helping other women who have been victims of sexual
or domestic violence through the recovery and healing process and on to better lives. </p>
<p>Through the long
struggle, over many years, to regain my confidence and sense of self, I have learned the value of
consciously reclaiming my body through exercise and self-care. Not enough can
be said about the value of this process and the implications it has for
emotional healing.</p>
<p>My goal is to start
and run a non-profit to help women repossess their bodies from their
abusers/attackers through a program that utilizes meditation
practice, exercise and nutrition. </p>
<p>The goal of the organization would be to lead exercise and cooking classes at women's shelters and other women's organizations. And, to encourage victims to join our ongoing support groups which would feature exercise, encouragement, life-coaching, healthy eating and guided meditation and relaxation techniques. </p>
<p>The funds will be used to complete the legal process of setting up and registering a small nonprofit organization and to pay a licensed therapist to partner in designing a program that will be the most beneficial to recovering women. I'm also seeking funds to complete my Holistic
Nutrition Therapy Certificate from the <a href=""http://ntischool.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nutrition Therapy Institute</a> in Denver
and to obtain a personal training certificate from <a href=""http://www.nasm.org/personal-trainer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NASM</a>. </p>

<p>I am Kehinde Ishangi: Dancer, choreographer, dance and movement scientist, educator, and creator of The Ishangi Institute for Dance and Movement Science. I created The Ishangi Institute because I realized that most people want to live life with graceful control over their physical body – not only dance artists and athletes. Sure it is true that physical well-being is the livelihood of a dancer/athlete. But what I realized is that for all people, healthy movement allows the precious gift of a grandfather to walk and play freely and fully with his grandchild. Or, for another, a walking enthusiast, to always be able to enjoy the serenity of hiking and nature trails. Or for each of us to be able to maintain rudimentary actions independently, such as brushing our hair without the limitations of a physical pain. All individuals want some sense of control over their physical bodies. Many people are not aware of how to move effectively nor efficiently, yet everyone wants to preserve their physical autonomy throughout their lives. The work I do helps individuals move with ease and effortlessness, but, most importantly, to take their control back with greater physical health, as well as confidence knowing their bodies are well. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>How what I do benefits others?</b></p>
<p>My work helps clients move better, feel better and live in a happier state within their physical body. Many of my clients have chronic pain and stressful lives that cause physical pain or are elite athletes who need to keep their body operating at optimum levels so that they can be relevant and successful in their careers. My work helps clients regain motor function, balance, flexibility and strength in their movement.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Why I do this?</b></p>
<p>Helping clients brings me the most joy. I am most fulfilled when I can aid a client  in achieving his/her goal of returning to a hobby that they missed practicing due to physical constraints or simply helping them to perform everyday physical activities with greater ease and grace. What makes me know that my work has been successful is not just that their physical goals have been met, but their whole being changes. They are more confident, poised and at ease in their bodies. They experience their strength and I get to witness their success. I take pride in my work and pride in seeing my clients overcome their physical limitations. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><p><b>How your contribution will help?</b></p>

These proceeds will be used to purchase the <b>GYROTONIC®</b> Pulley Tower, a machine needed to help clients both move and feel better.  With your support, <b>$3000 </b>will buy this equipment.

<p>Are you a busy,
health-conscious cook, plant-based food fan, or aspiring vegan? Imagine being
able to visually scan a curated collection of easy, tasty, and accessible
recipes on your phone or tablet, either while picking up some groceries on the
way home from work, or while standing at the fridge, wondering what to make
from ingredients you have on hand. Help bring our popular web resource into the
21st century with this campaign aimed at building VegKitchen’s app for planning
and making healthy meals easier and more fun.</p>
<p>I'm Nava Atlas,
the author of many well-known vegetarian (in the past) and vegan (more recently
and going forward) cookbooks. This year is not only the 30th anniversary of the
publication of my first book, <i>Vegetariana</i>,
but I’ve been running VegKitchen.com, a comprehensive recipe and health site
since 1996. We’re now<b> </b>entering our
19th year — an eternity in internet terms! What started as “In a Vegetarian
Kitchen” transitioned to simply VegKitchen in 2010 when the site went
completely plant-based. As a vegan myself since 2001, I wanted the site to
reflect my values.</p>
<p>VegKitchen offers
an abundance of content, featuring some 80 voices from around the healthy food
realm with new content being added almost daily. We’d like to see VegKitchen be
part of the vanguard of the vegan revolution, and are pleased that so many
authors, chefs, and nutrition experts choose to be part of our mission.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>
</p><p>To build an
easily navigable app, first we need to upgrade the photos for the recipes to be
included. Clear yet delicious-looking photos that read well even on a phone or
tablet will be how cooks navigate the categories, answering the never-ending
question of how to make healthy meals in the midst of a busy life. Categories will include
pastas, sandwiches and wraps, main-dish salads, soups and stews, veggie-packed
pizzas, grain and bean specialties, and more. Touch the photo of what appeals
to you, and up pops its recipe along with a shopping and pantry list, plus a
suggestion on how to complete the meal. </p>
<p>When navigating
our app, photos need to jump out, because what the hungry cook sees will help
them decide what they want to make at that very moment!
</p><p>
</p><p>We’ve started to test photo makeovers, which help make the recipes already on VegKitchen’s web site more accessible and appealing to readers: Here’s one example:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/613115/files/20140529171846-Chana-masala2.jpg?1401409126"" src="""" style=""width: 276.4347826086957px; height: 242px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/613117/files/20140529171958-Chana-masala1.jpg?1401409198"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 297px; height: 243px; background-color: initial;""/></p><p><i>Chana Masala, before and after (after photo by Hannah Kaminsky)</i></p><p>
</p><p>Next, we’ll work
closely with an app developer who has already created software in close
alignment with how we envision that our app will function. Though much work
still goes into this phase, existing software will streamline the process and
make it more economical than a from-scratch app build. Having this framework
will allow us to project the launching of our app for Spring 2015.</p>
<p>With a projected
250 recipes in this app — the size of a generous cookbook — our budget for this
phase of the project includes photographing the target recipes so that they are
clear and readable when presented on a device as small as a smartphone, along
with the initial beta build of the app.</p>

We're here to show how easy and tasty plant-based eating can be for anyone who's interested; enticing photos would definitely amp up the experience.</p><ul>
<li>Shifting to a vegan diet or at least a more plant-based diet has been shown to improve health and reduce risk of major disease.</li>
<li>Animal agriculture has been proven to exacerbate climate change. Shifting to plant-based eating has a far greater impact than changing light bulbs!</li>
<li>Land and water resources as well as the oceans are being decimated by the world's growing appetite for animal foods. And we all know that factory farming is one of the cruelest practices on earth.</li>
<li>All this being said, VegKitchen's overarching mission isn't about convincing people to go vegan, but to help them find plant-based info easily and enjoyably. With every meatless meal, you're making the world a better place and voting with your fork, as the saying goes.<br/><br/>

our app, photos need to jump out, because what the hungry cook sees will help
them decide what they want to make at that very moment!

We’ve started to test photo makeovers, which help make the recipes already on VegKitchen’s web site more accessible and appealing to readers: Here’s one example:Chana Masala, before and after (after photo by Hannah Kaminsky)
Next, we’ll work
closely with an app developer who has already created software in close
alignment with how we envision that our app will function. Though much work
still goes into this phase, existing software will streamline the process and
make it more economical than a from-scratch app build. Having this framework
will allow us to project the launching of our app for Spring 2015.
With a projected
250 recipes in this app — the size of a generous cookbook — our budget for this
phase of the project includes photographing the target recipes so that they are
clear and readable when presented on a device as small as a smartphone, along
with the initial beta build of the app.

For your donation, you'll receive anything from
a pdf of our 5 top vegan dinner recipes, to one or several of our popular
VegKitchen pdf e-books, up through a signed set of first editions of my two
earliest books, Vegetariana and American Harvest (long out of print and
now considered classics) along with signed original illustrations from those
books. And in between, signed copies of my vegan titles, including the most
recent, Wild About Greens and Vegan Holiday Kitchen. Upper level  donations
will also include a copy of my forthcoming, highly anticipated book, Plant Power (September 2014).


Even if we don't reach our entire goal, any
amount raised can and will go to continuing to develop this app. Whatever we
raise will be used to this end, and greatly appreciated.
The ImpactVegKitchen isn't just for vegans; hundreds of thousands of eaters of all kinds find our recipes and articles through search. We're here to show how easy and tasty plant-based eating can be for anyone who's interested; enticing photos would definitely amp up the experience.
Shifting to a vegan diet or at least a more plant-based diet has been shown to improve health and reduce risk of major disease.
Animal agriculture has been proven to exacerbate climate change. Shifting to plant-based eating has a far greater impact than changing light bulbs!
Land and water resources as well as the oceans are being decimated by the world's growing appetite for animal foods. And we all know that factory farming is one of the cruelest practices on earth.
All this being said, VegKitchen's overarching mission isn't about convincing people to go vegan, but to help them find plant-based info easily and enjoyably. With every meatless meal, you're making the world a better place and voting with your fork, as the saying goes.

<p>Experience the lively streets of Katutura in a new exciting and environmentally friendly way. KatuTours offers guided tours by bike through the culturally and historically rich township of Katatura, Windhoek’s former ‘blacks only’ suburbs during Apartheid rule. Experience the vibrant soul of Windhoek from the immediacy and intimacy of a bicycle and get a  taste of Namibia that you could never have from a car.</p>
<p>Katutura was built 10 kilometers outside of 'white' Windhoek to keep the black population from mixing with the white population.  There is limited public transport to get out to Katutura which can mean many tourists and visitors to Namibia miss out on an important cultural experience.  We wish to meet our cleints where they are and provide them with a service that is lacking - transport to get out and see the hearbeat of Windhoek.  We hope even to reach local Namibians who have never taken the opportunity to visit this cultural gem tucked 15 minutes outside their home city!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<p>Many times tourists and Namibians alike will neglect an entire side of Namibian culture because they are not comfortable with going to a township, even though they pass by it on a regular basis.  We aim to bridge this divide and foster deeper understanding amongst people who otherwise would not have any interaction.</p>
<p>We are currently sitting at #7 of the top 20 attractions in Windhoek on Tripadvisor.com.  We are also the #2 women owned businness in Namibia according to the Lions of Namibian annual competition.</p>

<p>Hi,
I am Yvonne, the U.S. coordinator for this tribal widow broom
business project in the Andhra Pradesh state of India. Yvonne has
been working with tribal leaders since 2013. We host a weekly
Thursday night online meeting to monitor our team effort and
progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yvonne
is a former computer software consultant and
24-year-ancient single mom.
In the past 15 years, She
has been on teams to countries including Austria,
Cambodia, Cameroon, Central
China, Cuba, Egypt, Israel,
North Korea, Philippines,
South Russia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United
Arab Emirates and more. From year 2007 till present time she
has been to India seven times. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now,
Yvonne and team (Barnabas, Jonathan, Silas and Sonya) are embarking on their
first-ever crowd funding campaign for the people they are passionate
about.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p><b><i><u>
</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u><i><b>
</b></i></u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u><i><b><i><b>
</b></i></b></i></u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u><i><b><i><b><i><b>Indian
Tribal Widowhood</b></i></b></i></b></i></u></i></b></p><u><i><b><i><b>
</b></i></b></i></u><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>
In
India's Caste system, all tribal people belong to the lowest,
despised caste and are nicknamed 'the untouchables.' Most
AP tribesmen live in huts (mud houses) without bathrooms. 

Women are deemed
inferior to men. Widows are often blamed for their husbands' death.
Young widows most likely can never be remarried. In 2014, Yvonne
found tribal women's illiteracy rate to be nearly 100%. In Andhra
Pradesh, a tribal woman's labor work earns her about USD 50 cents a day
which is half of a tribal man's pay. A widow has great difficulty
feeding herself and children. 
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456383031/qxtktze74ypztr1jmbyl.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 267.672px; height: 270px;""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>In
the photo above, 25-year-old Budamma lost her husband in a
goat delivery truck accident on January 2, 2016. She received the
truck insurance company's indemnity of USD$600. As a widow, Budamma
needs to raise her three and five-year-old boys alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p><i>
</i></p><p><b><i><u>The Generational Impact</u></i></b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So
you see this is why we are passionate about finding seed money to
help tribal widows create a broom business. The ladies and their

<p><b></b></p></div>","Hi,
I am Yvonne, the U.S. coordinator for this tribal widow broom
business project in the Andhra Pradesh state of India. Yvonne has
been working with tribal leaders since 2013. We host a weekly
Thursday night online meeting to monitor our team effort and
progress.



Yvonne
is a former computer software consultant and
24-year-ancient single mom.
In the past 15 years, She
has been on teams to countries including Austria,
Cambodia, Cameroon, Central
China, Cuba, Egypt, Israel,
North Korea, Philippines,
South Russia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United
Arab Emirates and more. From year 2007 till present time she
has been to India seven times. 



Now,
Yvonne and team (Barnabas, Jonathan, Silas and Sonya) are embarking on their
first-ever crowd funding campaign for the people they are passionate
about.





Indian
Tribal Widowhood






In
India's Caste system, all tribal people belong to the lowest,
despised caste and are nicknamed 'the untouchables.' Most
AP tribesmen live in huts (mud houses) without bathrooms. 

Women are deemed
inferior to men. Widows are often blamed for their husbands' death.
Young widows most likely can never be remarried. In 2014, Yvonne
found tribal women's illiteracy rate to be nearly 100%. In Andhra
Pradesh, a tribal woman's labor work earns her about USD 50 cents a day
which is half of a tribal man's pay. A widow has great difficulty
feeding herself and children. 


In
the photo above, 25-year-old Budamma lost her husband in a
goat delivery truck accident on January 2, 2016. She received the
truck insurance company's indemnity of USD$600. As a widow, Budamma
needs to raise her three and five-year-old boys alone.


The Generational Impact


So
you see this is why we are passionate about finding seed money to
help tribal widows create a broom business. The ladies and their
children will have a livelihood and possibly send their children to
school. They are not asking for handouts. They simply need love and
generosity to help them take on a new beginning and thrive against
all odds in a hostile culture and social system. This project will
create generational impact on the tribal families.

Would
you help these families?
Business Scenario
There are about 60
tribal widows. Leaders plan to start with 10 in five villages. They
can make brooms from March to May. After the broom season they can
find cultivation work between June and August. 


Analysis: 



Ten
	widows can, on average, produce seven brooms per day. Each will be
	paid 10 rupees per broom and thus 70 rupees a day (about USD $1). 
	


Raw
	materials for 4,000 brooms will cost about USD $3,000. Ten widows
	will need about two months to make them. When all sold proceeds will
	be about $4,250. 
	


Profit
	= $4,250 - $3,000 - wages $60 x 10 = $650 
	


Profit
	may be used as 1) bonus to the widows, 2) reinvestment into the next
	business project, and 3) recruit more widows to join the business.


The Seed Money
We are raising $3,000 to start a broom business prototype with 10
widows.  This is a historical and entrepreneurial effort in the AP
tribal region.


Yvonne has been coordinating donation effort and handling money transfer
from the U.S. to local Indian leaders for over two years. She is
involved in the International House of Prayer, Orange County in Santa
Ana, and Grace Mission Church International in Anaheim. Both
organizations reside in Southern California.

Your funds will be handled by FirstGiving,
Indiegogo's payment processor. FirstGiving will disburse money
directly to IHOP OC on a monthly basis. No matter how much funds may be raised, ALL, after standard
fees, will be transferred to the tribal region to start the broom business.

Will you help these women to take the challenge of being financially
independent?





Your
Fulfillment


Love
transforms lives! Your love and contribution transforms lives! Need
we say more?

In
turn, may your life be transformed!

On
behalf of tribal widows and leaders we thank you for your love, care
and generosity.


Risks
and Challenges


As
mentioned earlier... This is a historical and entrepreneurial effort
in this tribal region. Although seemingly a small project, we still
wonder if all brooms will be sold quickly. By taking a relatively low
risk we will find out what works and what doesn't. 


Other
than the women who will make the brooms there are other men and women
who act as liaisons, handle storage and shipment of raw material and
finished products. All of them will have on-the-job training and grow
in business leadership. 

Yvonne
has worked with a key local leader couple (shown in photo above) for over two years through
weekly communication and on-site visits. We are confident no matter
what challenges arise our team will embrace and resolve them
with openness and integrity.

As our society grows more reliant on digital communication the importance of personal connection becomes more and more apparent. Tea provides a safe and stimulating environment in which people from all walks of life can connect.</strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Wei Long Dong is the brainchild of Texas tea ambassadors So-Han Fan, Christopher Caballero and Tamara Spach.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>So-Han Fan</strong> is a Chinese-American born in New Orleans and raised in Texas.  His love of tea began in childhood, drinking aged pu-er while eating dim sum with his family.  After discovering the art of Gong Fu Cha while studying marine biology at university, he began teaching tea classes in Santa Cruz through the Free School.  He found that serving tea in the Gong Fu style was a perfect way to share his culture with others while providing a fascinating and social experience.  After graduating he moved to Austin in 2008 and got his feet wet in the tea industry working as the tea sommelier for Jade Leaves Tea House.  In 2010 he moved to China to pursue an environmental research position with the Chengdu Urban Rivers Association.  While there, he expanded his love of tea in the land of its birth and developed friendships with several tea farming families.  He started West China Tea Company upon his return in 2013 to share this farm-direct tea with the Austin community.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486060410/qd98ajdaws2eybxzxjmd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Tamara Spach</strong> was born in Brazil and moved to Israel at age 10.  When she turned 18 she began traveling the world, working on different community-oriented projects. She came upon Chinese tea culture at a party in Portland in 2011.  She was immediately captivated and began taking her tea set with her on her travels, pouring tea for whomever she met.  When she spotted West China Tea Company's booth at Archaic Revival festival in 2013, she was thrilled.  She and So-Han became fast friends and she helped West China Tea start the Tea Spot in 2015.  Having experienced first hand the connective and transformative powers of tea, she has dedicated herself to growing tea culture in Austin.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486060563/s2wxenvfin2cimrrui85.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong>Christopher Caballero</strong> is a Texas native with roots going back 8 generations.  He discovered the healing powers of tea through nutritional research while caring for his ailing grandmother.  In 2014 he co-founded the non-profit environmental Wild Rice Festival in San Marcos, which employed West China Tea Company to serve tea.  He and So-Han bonded over their mutual love of tea and water. Chris began serving tea at local gatherings in San Marcos with his friends as the SMTeaX collective.  In 2015 he traveled to China to source gong fu teaware for the rapidly-growing Texas tea community.  SMTeaX has partnered with West China Tea Company for local and out-of-state events to bring the rarefied environment of the Tea House to the Texas party and festival scene.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486061701/czbhunjw9uq6gxvfgwqr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Tea is what brought us together</i></strong>, and after hosting more than a thousand tea services, we discovered that the magic of tea is that it brings <strong>EVERYONE</strong> together.  What we had previously suspected was our personal nerdy obsession quickly became a movement. We had never anticipated that a seemingly-obscure Chinese cultural practice would become a major social outlet for thousands of Texans.  Soon the Tea Spot, at a humble 200 square feet, was crowded wall to wall with people huddled on cushions.  Dozens of San Martians would gather by the river in San Marcos on a sunny day to sip tea with SMTeaX.  We had tea dance parties that went all night long, tea sits where we discussed spiritual texts and social issues, jam sessions, poetry readings, workshops and classes.  After serving tea at large festivals, sometimes with as many as 6 tea servers at once, we realized that the only thing limiting the number of people who come to drink tea is space.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486061894/jkn2x3ise2u0cjsj4mus.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> We realized something else as well:  that when people gather for tea, something amazing happens.  Tea provides a perfect focal point for conversation, with the server and with the people drinking tea with you, many of whom were previously strangers.  People drop their guard and begin to feel comfortable with each other.  And when people feel comfortable, they start sharing.  They share stories, they share their thoughts, and they share their unique perspective by expressing themselves artistically.  A community centered around tea quickly snowballed into being.  People took gong fu cha classes, bought tea sets, and served tea at their own gatherings to their friends. <strong> <i>Tea is more than just a beverage, it's a safe space and a healthy, beautiful practice.  It's connection, an invitation to be present and express, a vehicle for discussion and a catalyst for community</i>.</strong>  Now all we need is a place to do it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Enter Wei Long Dong Tea House. </strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> Located in central Austin, this beautiful wood-floored building has more than 3,000 square feet and enough space for more than 100 people to sit together for tea.  In addition to a large reception room and an intimate private tea studio, it features a courtyard, ample parking, and one large hall big enough to host yoga classes in.  This is our opportunity to create an exquisite oasis in the middle of Austin, a world where people can not only gather over tea but express themselves and connect in ways that we can't even begin to anticipate.  We've already signed a 3-year lease and the space is waiting for us to fill it with tea and life.  This is where you can help us!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> We're stepping into a new space 15 times the size of our old one, and this increase in space necessitates an order of magnitude increase in our tea and teaware inventory.  To fully stock the tea house with our entire catalog of more than 130 teas, as well as enough Chinese and locally-made teaware to meet the growing demand, will require $30,000 in initial inventory.  This will ensure we have everything in sufficient quantities that we won't be constantly running out.  The Tea Spot operated out of 200 square feet and hosted one tasting per day, for three hours, with a maximum occupancy of 15 and a single server.  In the new space we will need more tea to serve as well as sell, and a whole fleet of brand new tea sets for use by staff, customers, and gong fu cha students.  We'll need kettles, water filters, tables, chairs, cushions, yoga mats, rugs, tablecloths, tapestries, paint, decorations, and shelving.  We want a library, a record collection, a sound system, and lighting to accommodate both intimate gatherings and epic dance parties.  And wherever possible, we'd like to use locally-made goods by skilled craftspeople in our community instead of manufactured products.  We don't just want a tea house, we want a beautiful tea house.  A growing company boot-strapping into an unprecedented expansion, we can share not only the finest tea but also create an elegant and unique environment, with community support.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The breakdown:  </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">$20,000 buys us 135 pounds of tea, enough to serve and sell without running out before we can secure more tea to replace it.  Farm-direct tea is a seasonal product, and once a small-batch tea runs out we can't get it again until the next year.  This coming spring is our opportunity to stock up to ensure tea-thirsty Austinites have a dependable supply.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">$10,000 will get us 20 tea sets for our staff and customers to use in-house, as well as a diverse selection of high quality imported and local wares for sale and for outside events.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">$12,000 will make sure we have shelves to store and display our merchandise,  floor-level and raised tables, cushions, and chairs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">$3,000 will get us a sound system for performances, dance parties, lectures, workshops, and funky tea house music.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">$3,000 buys us a professional array of lighting to create diverse atmospheres in our Great Hall.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">$8,000 has been earmarked for acquiring beautiful decorations, from tapestries and paintings to scrolls, screens, rugs, and curtains.  Where possible we will source second-hand, eco-friendly, and locally-made goods to minimize our footprint and create a distinctive environment. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">$1,000 will be for operational expenses, including office supplies, cleaning supplies, scales, scoops, gloves, canisters, bags and labels for selling tea, as well as business cards, literature, signage, and branded Wei Long Dong merchandise.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">And finally we've budgeted $3,000 to payroll.  In general, payroll is a recurring expense that is funded by the income of the tea house.  But $3,000 gives us a buffer to make sure that we can pay our employees a living wage while we build up momentum.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Perks</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Some of our perks are self-explanatory - a t-shirt, a bumper sticker, etc.  But some of our most special perks are experiential.  These include tea tastings, tea classes, and a very special once-in-a-lifetime journey to the homeland of tea.  People who have been to the Tea Spot or experienced gong fu cha elsewhere will have some idea of what these are, but here's an explanation of what gong fu cha is and what these perks will entail.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Tea Tasting</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our $10 perk is free admission to one tea tasting at Wei Long Dong.  A tea tasting is one of our most basic services offered at Wei Long Dong, and is at the foundation of tea culture.  With its beautiful tools, elegant gestures, and ritualistic atmosphere, gong fu cha is often mistaken for a tea ""ceremony"".  On the contrary, a tea tasting is a casual gathering where people sit together to drink tea prepared by a practitioner skilled in the art of gong fu cha, or the Chinese tea service.  This centuries-old tradition emphasizes steeping tea with attention and practice to bring out the unique and complex flavors, fragrances, and qi of artisan tea.  The gathering itself is social, stimulating, and relaxing.  Each tea is steeped multiple times, changing with each infusion, telling a story over the course of the tasting.  The server shares information and stories about each tea, and helps guide the participants to help them enjoy the tea, hone their palette, and understand the culture and philosophy behind Chinese tea.  The tea table is an environment where people who were once strangers can engage in meaningful discussion, form bonds, and build lasting friendships.  We will be holding three tea tastings per day at Wei Long Dong, many having different themes.  Some are focused on expanding knowledge and familiarity with tea and tea culture, focusing on different categories of tea, specific regions, or styles of tea service.  Others explore diverse topics or activities, including poetry readings, social and political dialogue, sacred text discussions, jam sessions, costume parties, dream weaves, and pretty much anything we can imagine.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Gong Fu Cha Classes</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Spreading tea culture isn't just about serving tea to people, it's about giving people the tools and knowledge they need to share tea with their friends.  We offer training in the art of gong fu cha so that people can serve tea at home and cultivate their own skill, knowledge, and appreciation of tea.  Guests who know how to serve tea will also be able to rent tea sets from us and pour their own tea at the tea house.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Sip Tickets</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A Sip Ticket is a bundle of pre-paid tea tastings.  The more you buy at one time, the cheaper they are.  When you come to Wei Long Dong we'll simply stamp your ticket and you get access to any $10 tea tasting.  6 tastings for $50, 13 for $100, $350 for 50 or $600 for 100.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Membership</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Wei Long Dong isn't just a place of business, it's a place to congregate, socialize, express, share, and connect.  Wei Long Dong is meant to be a home away from home, where you can go any time and know that friends will be waiting for you gathered around tea.  Membership allows you to come any time and get free use of a house tea set and one pot of free tea per day.   Also come with guest passes so you can bring a friend to serve tea to.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Tea Journey Through China</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We travel to China to source tea and tea ware directly from tea farmers and craftspeople.  This year we're going to give 8 contributors the chance to join us for a very special tour through the homeland of tea and tea culture.   We'll go to mountaintop farms, ancient cities, and remote locations that normal tourists would never have the opportunity to visit.  The first week of the tour will take us to Eastern China, to Chaozhou, the home of gong fu cha and Phoenix oolongs, as well as Fuding, Fujian, the home of white tea, and Wuyi Mountain, home of Rock Oolongs and Black Tea.  The second week we will visit the beautiful karst mountains of Guangxi, home of Seven Immortals Green Tea and aged smoked Guyu Cha, used to make an ancient style of fried, pounded, and boiled beverage called <i>you cha</i>.  Then we'll travel to Yunnan, the biological home of the tea plant, to pick tea from the ancient tea trees of Nannuo Mountain.  We'll pick and process our own pu er tea, and press our own bings, or tea cakes, in the traditional style using stone weights.  Your hand-pressed tea cake, made of tea we picked ourselves, will improve with age, serving as a drinkable souvenir of this once-in-a-lifetime journey.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Locally Made Tea Knife</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Tea knives, or <i>cha dao</i> 茶刀, are special blades used to open cakes of tea, called <i>bing</i><i>s</i> 饼.  Our locally-made tea knives are hand-forged in Austin by Trystan Hegar.  These one-of-a-kind artisan knives are elegant and ergonomically designed, and perfectly curved to open tea bings and bricks without crushing the leaves.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Silver Tea Necklace</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our silver tea necklaces are made from actual dried tea leaves fired with precious metal clay to produce a pure silver pendant.  The resulting necklace captures all the beauty of the tea leaf, each serration, vein, and wrinkle in perfect relief.  The leaf is destroyed in the firing process, so each pendant is one-of-a-kind.  Made in Austin by local jeweler Emily Spykman of Clementine &amp; Co., each necklace comes with an ounce of the tea it is made from and a description of the tea.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Wei Long Dong Branded Tea Set</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A gong fu tea set consisting of a white porcelain gaiwan, glass gong dao bei, bamboo cha pan, and 6 porcelain cups.  The porcelain pieces are branded with our name and logo, and are currently available only to donors to our crowdfunding campaign.  </p>

Christopher Caballero is a Texas native with roots going back 8 generations.  He discovered the healing powers of tea through nutritional research while caring for his ailing grandmother.  In 2014 he co-founded the non-profit environmental Wild Rice Festival in San Marcos, which employed West China Tea Company to serve tea.  He and So-Han bonded over their mutual love of tea and water. Chris began serving tea at local gatherings in San Marcos with his friends as the SMTeaX collective.  In 2015 he traveled to China to source gong fu teaware for the rapidly-growing Texas tea community.  SMTeaX has partnered with West China Tea Company for local and out-of-state events to bring the rarefied environment of the Tea House to the Texas party and festival scene.
 
Tea is what brought us together, and after hosting more than a thousand tea services, we discovered that the magic of tea is that it brings EVERYONE together.  What we had previously suspected was our personal nerdy obsession quickly became a movement. We had never anticipated that a seemingly-obscure Chinese cultural practice would become a major social outlet for thousands of Texans.  Soon the Tea Spot, at a humble 200 square feet, was crowded wall to wall with people huddled on cushions.  Dozens of San Martians would gather by the river in San Marcos on a sunny day to sip tea with SMTeaX.  We had tea dance parties that went all night long, tea sits where we discussed spiritual texts and social issues, jam sessions, poetry readings, workshops and classes.  After serving tea at large festivals, sometimes with as many as 6 tea servers at once, we realized that the only thing limiting the number of people who come to drink tea is space.

 We realized something else as well:  that when people gather for tea, something amazing happens.  Tea provides a perfect focal point for conversation, with the server and with the people drinking tea with you, many of whom were previously strangers.  People drop their guard and begin to feel comfortable with each other.  And when people feel comfortable, they start sharing.  They share stories, they share their thoughts, and they share their unique perspective by expressing themselves artistically.  A community centered around tea quickly snowballed into being.  People took gong fu cha classes, bought tea sets, and served tea at their own gatherings to their friends.  Tea is more than just a beverage, it's a safe space and a healthy, beautiful practice.  It's connection, an invitation to be present and express, a vehicle for discussion and a catalyst for community.  Now all we need is a place to do it.
Enter Wei Long Dong Tea House. 
 Located in central Austin, this beautiful wood-floored building has more than 3,000 square feet and enough space for more than 100 people to sit together for tea.  In addition to a large reception room and an intimate private tea studio, it features a courtyard, ample parking, and one large hall big enough to host yoga classes in.  This is our opportunity to create an exquisite oasis in the middle of Austin, a world where people can not only gather over tea but express themselves and connect in ways that we can't even begin to anticipate.  We've already signed a 3-year lease and the space is waiting for us to fill it with tea and life.  This is where you can help us!
 We're stepping into a new space 15 times the size of our old one, and this increase in space necessitates an order of magnitude increase in our tea and teaware inventory.  To fully stock the tea house with our entire catalog of more than 130 teas, as well as enough Chinese and locally-made teaware to meet the growing demand, will require $30,000 in initial inventory.  This will ensure we have everything in sufficient quantities that we won't be constantly running out.  The Tea Spot operated out of 200 square feet and hosted one tasting per day, for three hours, with a maximum occupancy of 15 and a single server.  In the new space we will need more tea to serve as well as sell, and a whole fleet of brand new tea sets for use by staff, customers, and gong fu cha students.  We'll need kettles, water filters, tables, chairs, cushions, yoga mats, rugs, tablecloths, tapestries, paint, decorations, and shelving.  We want a library, a record collection, a sound system, and lighting to accommodate both intimate gatherings and epic dance parties.  And wherever possible, we'd like to use locally-made goods by skilled craftspeople in our community instead of manufactured products.  We don't just want a tea house, we want a beautiful tea house.  A growing company boot-strapping into an unprecedented expansion, we can share not only the finest tea but also create an elegant and unique environment, with community support.  
The breakdown:  
$20,000 buys us 135 pounds of tea, enough to serve and sell without running out before we can secure more tea to replace it.  Farm-direct tea is a seasonal product, and once a small-batch tea runs out we can't get it again until the next year.  This coming spring is our opportunity to stock up to ensure tea-thirsty Austinites have a dependable supply.
$10,000 will get us 20 tea sets for our staff and customers to use in-house, as well as a diverse selection of high quality imported and local wares for sale and for outside events.
$12,000 will make sure we have shelves to store and display our merchandise,  floor-level and raised tables, cushions, and chairs.
$3,000 will get us a sound system for performances, dance parties, lectures, workshops, and funky tea house music.  
$3,000 buys us a professional array of lighting to create diverse atmospheres in our Great Hall.
$8,000 has been earmarked for acquiring beautiful decorations, from tapestries and paintings to scrolls, screens, rugs, and curtains.  Where possible we will source second-hand, eco-friendly, and locally-made goods to minimize our footprint and create a distinctive environment. 
$1,000 will be for operational expenses, including office supplies, cleaning supplies, scales, scoops, gloves, canisters, bags and labels for selling tea, as well as business cards, literature, signage, and branded Wei Long Dong merchandise.
And finally we've budgeted $3,000 to payroll.  In general, payroll is a recurring expense that is funded by the income of the tea house.  But $3,000 gives us a buffer to make sure that we can pay our employees a living wage while we build up momentum.
 
Our Perks
Some of our perks are self-explanatory - a t-shirt, a bumper sticker, etc.  But some of our most special perks are experiential.  These include tea tastings, tea classes, and a very special once-in-a-lifetime journey to the homeland of tea.  People who have been to the Tea Spot or experienced gong fu cha elsewhere will have some idea of what these are, but here's an explanation of what gong fu cha is and what these perks will entail.
Tea Tasting
Our $10 perk is free admission to one tea tasting at Wei Long Dong.  A tea tasting is one of our most basic services offered at Wei Long Dong, and is at the foundation of tea culture.  With its beautiful tools, elegant gestures, and ritualistic atmosphere, gong fu cha is often mistaken for a tea ""ceremony"".  On the contrary, a tea tasting is a casual gathering where people sit together to drink tea prepared by a practitioner skilled in the art of gong fu cha, or the Chinese tea service.  This centuries-old tradition emphasizes steeping tea with attention and practice to bring out the unique and complex flavors, fragrances, and qi of artisan tea.  The gathering itself is social, stimulating, and relaxing.  Each tea is steeped multiple times, changing with each infusion, telling a story over the course of the tasting.  The server shares information and stories about each tea, and helps guide the participants to help them enjoy the tea, hone their palette, and understand the culture and philosophy behind Chinese tea.  The tea table is an environment where people who were once strangers can engage in meaningful discussion, form bonds, and build lasting friendships.  We will be holding three tea tastings per day at Wei Long Dong, many having different themes.  Some are focused on expanding knowledge and familiarity with tea and tea culture, focusing on different categories of tea, specific regions, or styles of tea service.  Others explore diverse topics or activities, including poetry readings, social and political dialogue, sacred text discussions, jam sessions, costume parties, dream weaves, and pretty much anything we can imagine.  
Gong Fu Cha Classes
Spreading tea culture isn't just about serving tea to people, it's about giving people the tools and knowledge they need to share tea with their friends.  We offer training in the art of gong fu cha so that people can serve tea at home and cultivate their own skill, knowledge, and appreciation of tea.  Guests who know how to serve tea will also be able to rent tea sets from us and pour their own tea at the tea house.  
Sip Tickets
A Sip Ticket is a bundle of pre-paid tea tastings.  The more you buy at one time, the cheaper they are.  When you come to Wei Long Dong we'll simply stamp your ticket and you get access to any $10 tea tasting.  6 tastings for $50, 13 for $100, $350 for 50 or $600 for 100.  
Membership
Wei Long Dong isn't just a place of business, it's a place to congregate, socialize, express, share, and connect.  Wei Long Dong is meant to be a home away from home, where you can go any time and know that friends will be waiting for you gathered around tea.  Membership allows you to come any time and get free use of a house tea set and one pot of free tea per day.   Also come with guest passes so you can bring a friend to serve tea to.
Tea Journey Through China
We travel to China to source tea and tea ware directly from tea farmers and craftspeople.  This year we're going to give 8 contributors the chance to join us for a very special tour through the homeland of tea and tea culture.   We'll go to mountaintop farms, ancient cities, and remote locations that normal tourists would never have the opportunity to visit.  The first week of the tour will take us to Eastern China, to Chaozhou, the home of gong fu cha and Phoenix oolongs, as well as Fuding, Fujian, the home of white tea, and Wuyi Mountain, home of Rock Oolongs and Black Tea.  The second week we will visit the beautiful karst mountains of Guangxi, home of Seven Immortals Green Tea and aged smoked Guyu Cha, used to make an ancient style of fried, pounded, and boiled beverage called you cha.  Then we'll travel to Yunnan, the biological home of the tea plant, to pick tea from the ancient tea trees of Nannuo Mountain.  We'll pick and process our own pu er tea, and press our own bings, or tea cakes, in the traditional style using stone weights.  Your hand-pressed tea cake, made of tea we picked ourselves, will improve with age, serving as a drinkable souvenir of this once-in-a-lifetime journey.
Locally Made Tea Knife
Tea knives, or cha dao 茶刀, are special blades used to open cakes of tea, called bings 饼.  Our locally-made tea knives are hand-forged in Austin by Trystan Hegar.  These one-of-a-kind artisan knives are elegant and ergonomically designed, and perfectly curved to open tea bings and bricks without crushing the leaves.  
Silver Tea Necklace
Our silver tea necklaces are made from actual dried tea leaves fired with precious metal clay to produce a pure silver pendant.  The resulting necklace captures all the beauty of the tea leaf, each serration, vein, and wrinkle in perfect relief.  The leaf is destroyed in the firing process, so each pendant is one-of-a-kind.  Made in Austin by local jeweler Emily Spykman of Clementine & Co., each necklace comes with an ounce of the tea it is made from and a description of the tea.
Wei Long Dong Branded Tea Set
A gong fu tea set consisting of a white porcelain gaiwan, glass gong dao bei, bamboo cha pan, and 6 porcelain cups.  The porcelain pieces are branded with our name and logo, and are currently available only to donors to our crowdfunding campaign.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p>Tandem Bedding is a wholly <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Canadian</span></strong> company, inventor of a new set of specialized bedding for couples who don’t have the same tolerance for temperature when it comes to bedtime. To satisfy the two occupants of the same bed, the fitted sheet and the flat sheet are specially manufactured so that one side of the bed is made of warm flannel, while the other side is made of light and fresh cotton.</p>
<p>A great adventure began for two sisters who decided to come together to create  a  business  plan based on a dream and an idea. They invested an enormous amount of time in Tandem Bedding sets, devoting energy and money to the development, research materials, and design of the product. <em>“We have revolutionized the world of bedding with a product to the greatness of our requirements, higher level design, high quality bedding and at an affordable price.”</em></p>
<p>A year and a half has passed since the beginning of that adventure and we have had our final product for a year now. However, despite our boundless energy and our incredible willingness to move forward, our project has stalled due to lack of financial resources. A product as unique as ours is cannot claim its place in the market without an advertising campaign to support it and make it known to consumers. Since advertising costs are very high, we are looking for financial backing to help us achieve the visibility required to emerge Tandem Bedding sets from obscurity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Project Description :</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>!!!!I’M TOO HOT!!!!! YOU’RE TOO COLD!!!!</strong></p>
<p>... No more bedtime arguments...</p>
<p>The Tandem set of flat and fitted bed sheets offers 2-in-1 comfort.</p>
<p>This new innovation in bedding sheets allows each individual in the same bed to enjoy comfort based on their tolerance to heat or cold. Tandem bedding sheets have a longitudinal seam joining two fabrics specially selected for their varied characteristics; in our case a light and cool COTTON, and a warm and comforting FLANEL to meet the needs of conflicting preferences.</p>
<ul>
<li>On one side of the bed, the flat sheet and the fitted sheet are made of 100% COTTON permitting light, fresh air circulation and moisture to keep you cool.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>On the other side of the bed, the flat sheet and the fitted sheet are made of warm and comforting FLANNEL that envelops you and keeps you warm.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Each individual maintains his or her own comfort level regardless of their tolerance to cold or heat while sharing exactly the same environment at bedtime. Both sheets are reversible in order  to meet your preferred side.</li>

<p>Our objective is clear: we want to fill the gap currently found in bedding set standards with a simple but avant-gardist approach. No progress has been made in this area and yet, every one of us climbs into bed night after night for well-deserved rest - and we are often accompanied by loved ones. Each individual has their own tolerance to cold and heat, while sharing exactly the same environment at bedtime. We believe that comfort affords us a deeper sleep and therefore a more restful night to face each new busy day.</p>

<h2><strong>We ask for your financial support in order to reach a total of $50, 000. </strong></h2>
<p>We have already invested more than $ 70 000.00 in our Tandem bedding project. Our bedding is developed, but our biggest challenge is yet to come. Advertising, one of the most crucial steps and also one of the most expensive is essential in order to discover this new product to the general public only features<strong>.</strong></p>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>We used ingenuity and all our charms to get the most of free advertising.</strong></div>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We have developed a website, including a system for fast delivery across Canada, as well as a payment service which is easily and securely accessible through Paypal. <a href=""http://www.literietandem.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.literietandem.com</a>
</li>
<li>We have created a Facebook page that can be visited at ‘literie tandem’ to keep fans informed of events in which we participate, as well as the latest news about our bedding products.</li>
<li>We have been promoted in various radio and television programs. More than a dozen of them have spoken about Tandem bedding free in the context of chronic novelty, original idea or discovery.</li>
<li>We also approached several newspapers and magazines; they have gladly shared information about our new product.</li>
<li>Because we have reached the patent stage with our invention, we have also been invited to participate in different home shows, free of charge, to promote our product.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>We have also tried to obtain government grants, but currently none apply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Despite our best efforts</strong>, we need greater visibility to create a demand strong enough to grow our business. We are at the point where we need to make ads that will affect a wide audience. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our aim is to have the financial capability to produce television advertising which will air during primetime over an extended period.</span> This amount would allow us to produce our first television advertisement and air it for a period of about one month. We hope that this television advertising will entice potential customers and will allow us to continue to promote our product with the capital generated from the presumed increased sales.</p>
<p>We truly need and appreciate any help you can offer. Your support will allow our company to be known across Canada.</p>
<p>Give what you can - every dollar counts! Demonstrate the power of the whole community. Supporting our small business and giving us the chance to grow will allow us to pay it forward in the future by creating new jobs in our community and increasing the wealth of our country as a whole!</p>
<p>You can also support us by talking about our product to your family, colleagues and friends! Word of mouth can do wonders for a small business like ours. A simple discussion between friends or on social networks is a great way for us to become known. If one person speaks to two, the latter two will reach four and those four people may reach eight… this can easily become exponential exposure for us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Thank you very much to all of you.</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our history:</span></strong></p>
<p>It all started over 15 years ago by one of the two founders of the company, Josée. She was in a relationship and when it came time to sleep, it was like Groundhog Day ... During the winter her spouse was always opening the window for cool and fresh air and did not want to replace the cotton sheets by a set of flannel ones. This was the only way he was able to sleep and enjoy a full night's sleep. It was the same story in summer ... the air-conditioning was ever present in the room and lightweight cotton sheets kept everything cool at night. The problem then became that Josée was chill all year long. Despite the addition of warm blanket over the sheets, the comfort just wasn’t there. There was more heat as her body acclimated to the sheets but the initial brush of the cotton was still cold. The sheets moved throughout the night and made it difficult and tedious to make the bed in the morning. As a result, Josée slept poorly. One frustrated morning, an idea hit: “One day I'm going to invent sheets that are half and half so we both sleep well!""</p>
<p>That day has finally come fifteen years later. The desire to start up the company was intriguing but nearly impossible to accomplish on her own.  In 2011 Josée discussed the concept with her sister Manon who decided to join the project has a financial partner. Josée, who is already working full-time in her trade, jumped into overdrive. Manon had worked in sales for 23 years, and had a bachelor and a master's degree in microbiology. Josée had a diploma in mechanical building and worked in the industry for 18 years, but in recent years, was known as a art painter sold across Canada.</p>

<p>Literie Tandem est une compagnie entièrement <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">québécoise</span></strong>, inventeur d’un tout nouvel ensemble de literie spécialisé pour les couples qui, quand vient l’heure du coucher, n’ont pas la même tolérance au froid et à la chaleur. Afin de satisfaire les deux occupants d’un même lit, le drap contour et le drap plat d’un côté du lit sont en flanelle chaude, tandis que l’autre côté du lit est en coton léger et frais.</p>
<p>D’une idée, vient un rêve et le début d’une grande aventure pour deux sœurs qui décident de s’affilier pour créer un projet d’entreprise. Énormément d’investissement de temps, d’énergie et d’argent a été consacré à la mise en place, la recherche des matières, l’élaboration et la conception des ensembles de literie Tandem. <em>Nous avons révolutionné le monde de la literie avec un produit à la grandeur de nos exigences, de niveau de conception supérieure, une literie de très haute qualité, et ce, à prix abordable.</em></p>
<p>Un an et demi s’est écoulés depuis le début de notre belle aventure et nous avons en main notre produit final depuis maintenant un an, mais malgré notre énergie débordante et notre étonnante volonté de foncer, notre projet stagne faute de ressource financière. Un produit, aussi exceptionnel qu’il soit, ne peut trouver sa place sur le marché sans une campagne de publicité pour l’appuyer et le faire connaître aux consommateurs. Puisque les coûts de publicité sont très élevés, nous sommes à la recherche de fond pour nous aider à obtenir la visibilité nécessaire pour faire sortir les ensembles de literie Tandem de l’ombre.</p>

<p>Notre objectif est clair, nous voulons combler par une approche simple, mais avant-gardiste, les lacunes que l’on retrouve dans les ensembles de literie standard. Aucune progression n’a jamais été faite dans ce domaine et pourtant, tous autant que nous sommes, rejoignons notre lit soir après soir pour un repos bien mérité, et très souvent accompagné de l’être cher. Chaque individu possède sa propre tolérance au froid et à la chaleur, tout en partageant exactement le même environnement à l’heure du coucher. Selon nous, plus de confort égal un sommeil plus profond donc plus réparateur pour affronter une nouvelle journée bien remplie.</p>

<h1>Nous sollicitons votre support financier afin</h1>
<h1>d’atteindre un montant de $50 000.00.</h1>
<p>Nous avons déjà investi plus de $ 70 000.00 dans notre projet de literie Tandem. Notre ensemble de literie est au point, mais notre plus grand défi  reste à venir. La publicité, l’une des étapes les plus cruciales et également l’une des plus coûteuses est primordiale afin de faire découvrir ce nouveau produit aux caractéristiques unique au grand public.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Nous</strong> <strong>avons usé d’ingéniosité et de tous nos charmes afin d’obtenir le maximum de publicité gratuite.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Nous avons conçu notre site internet, incluant un système de livraison rapide à travers le Canada ainsi qu’un service de paiement facile et sécuritaire par Paypal. <a href=""http://www.literietandem.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.literietandem.com</a>
</li>
<li>Nous avons créé notre page Facebook que vous pouvez visiter sur <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">literie tandem</span>, afin de vous tenir au courant des évènements auxquels nous prenons part, ainsi que les nouvelles les plus récentes concernant notre literie</li>
<li>Nous avons rejoint et fait connaître notre literie à diverses émissions radiophonique et télévisuelle. Plus d’une dizaine d’entre eux en ont parlé dans le cadre de chronique de nouveauté, d’idée cadeau originale ou de trouvaille.</li>
<li>Nous avons également approché plusieurs journaux et revues qui ont avec plaisir partagé l’information sur notre nouveau produit.</li>
<li>Puisque que nous sommes en processus de brevet avec notre invention, nous avons également été invités à participer à différent salon de l’habitation afin de promouvoir gratuitement notre produit.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Nous avons également tenté d’obtenir des subventions gouvernementales, mais aucune ne s’applique.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Malgré tous nos efforts,</strong> nous avons besoin d’une plus grande visibilité pour créer « la » demande assez forte pour faire progresser notre entreprise. Nous sommes au point où nous devons faire des publicités qui toucheraient à un très large auditoire. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Notre objectif est d’avoir la capacité financière de faire produire une publicité télévisée, et également de la faire voir sur des chaînes télévisées de grande écoute, et ce pour une période prolongée.</span> Cette somme nous permettrait de faire produire notre première publicité télévisée et de la faire diffuser pour une période d’environ un mois. Nous espérons que le roulement ainsi apporté nous permettrait ensuite de poursuivre nous même notre promotion avec notre propre fonds de roulement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nous avons vraiment besoin de vous, votre soutien nous permettra de lancer notre compagnie à travers tout le Canada.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Donnez ce que vous pouvez – chaque dollar compte ! Démontrons ensemble le pouvoir de la collectivité. En supportant notre petite entreprise, vous lui donnez la chance de devenir plus grande, et ainsi nous pourrons également redonner au suivant en créant de nouveaux emplois dans notre communauté tout en augmentant la richesse de notre pays !!</p>
<p>Vous pouvez également nous soutenir en parlant de notre produit à vos parents, collèges et amis ! Une simple discussion entre ami ou sur les réseaux sociaux est une belle publicité pour nous. Une personne qui en parle à deux, ces deux derniers qui en parlent à quatre, quatre personnes qui en parlent à huit, c’est exponentiel et excellent pour nous faire connaître. </p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Notre histoire :</span></strong></p>
<p>Tout a commencé il y a plus de 15 ans par une des deux fondatrices de la compagnie, soit Josée. Elle est en couple, et quand vient l’heure du couché, c’est le jour de la marmotte…en hiver son conjoint qui a toujours chaud ouvrait la fenêtre pour plus de fraîcheur et ne voulait pas remplacer les draps de coton par un ensemble de flanelle. Il n’y avait que de cette façon qu’il arrivait à bien s’endormir et à profiter d’une nuit complète de sommeil réparateur. Un peu le même principe en été…l’air climatisée très présente dans la chambre et les draps de coton glacés et légers le garde au frais la nuit. Le problème se transfert donc du côté de Josée qui est frileuse. Malgré l’ajout de couverture chaude par-dessus les draps, le confort n’y est pas. Il y a plus de chaleur mais les draps de coton restent quand même glacés. Les draps se déplacent, c’est long à faire le lit le matin, elle dort mal et ne profite pas au maximum de ses heures de sommeil. Elle lui lance… « un jour j’vais inventer des draps qui seront moitié moitié pour qu’on dorme bien tous les deux !!!» </p>
<p>Ce jour est donc venu une quinzaine d’années plus tard. L’envie de se lancer est intéressante, mais seule c’est impossible. Elle en discute en 2011 avec sa sœur Manon qui décide de devenir sa partenaire financière. Josée, qui travaille déjà à temps plein dans son métier, met les bouchées doubles. Manon travail dans la vente depuis 23 ans, elle possède un DEC, un BAC et une maitrise en microbiologie. Josée a un DEC en mécanique du bâtiment, domaine dans lequel elle a travaillé pendant 18 ans, mais est depuis quelques années, artiste peintre vendu dans 5 galeries d’art à travers le Canada.</p>

Tandem Bedding is a wholly Canadian company, inventor of a new set of specialized bedding for couples who don’t have the same tolerance for temperature when it comes to bedtime. To satisfy the two occupants of the same bed, the fitted sheet and the flat sheet are specially manufactured so that one side of the bed is made of warm flannel, while the other side is made of light and fresh cotton.
A great adventure began for two sisters who decided to come together to create  a  business  plan based on a dream and an idea. They invested an enormous amount of time in Tandem Bedding sets, devoting energy and money to the development, research materials, and design of the product. “We have revolutionized the world of bedding with a product to the greatness of our requirements, higher level design, high quality bedding and at an affordable price.”
A year and a half has passed since the beginning of that adventure and we have had our final product for a year now. However, despite our boundless energy and our incredible willingness to move forward, our project has stalled due to lack of financial resources. A product as unique as ours is cannot claim its place in the market without an advertising campaign to support it and make it known to consumers. Since advertising costs are very high, we are looking for financial backing to help us achieve the visibility required to emerge Tandem Bedding sets from obscurity.
 
Project Description :
!!!!I’M TOO HOT!!!!! YOU’RE TOO COLD!!!!
... No more bedtime arguments...
The Tandem set of flat and fitted bed sheets offers 2-in-1 comfort.
This new innovation in bedding sheets allows each individual in the same bed to enjoy comfort based on their tolerance to heat or cold. Tandem bedding sheets have a longitudinal seam joining two fabrics specially selected for their varied characteristics; in our case a light and cool COTTON, and a warm and comforting FLANEL to meet the needs of conflicting preferences.

On one side of the bed, the flat sheet and the fitted sheet are made of 100% COTTON permitting light, fresh air circulation and moisture to keep you cool.
 

On the other side of the bed, the flat sheet and the fitted sheet are made of warm and comforting FLANNEL that envelops you and keeps you warm.
 

Each individual maintains his or her own comfort level regardless of their tolerance to cold or heat while sharing exactly the same environment at bedtime. Both sheets are reversible in order  to meet your preferred side.
  
                    
      Overview of the bedding                       Close up of the bedding                          
      Include : one fitted sheet
                    one flat sheet
                    two pillowcases
 
                          
      Bedsheet schema                                     Label packaging
 
 
Our objective is clear: we want to fill the gap currently found in bedding set standards with a simple but avant-gardist approach. No progress has been made in this area and yet, every one of us climbs into bed night after night for well-deserved rest - and we are often accompanied by loved ones. Each individual has their own tolerance to cold and heat, while sharing exactly the same environment at bedtime. We believe that comfort affords us a deeper sleep and therefore a more restful night to face each new busy day.
 MADE IN CANADA
You can find all the details by browsing our website at www.literietandem.com
 
We ask for your financial support in order to reach a total of $50, 000. 
We have already invested more than $ 70 000.00 in our Tandem bedding project. Our bedding is developed, but our biggest challenge is yet to come. Advertising, one of the most crucial steps and also one of the most expensive is essential in order to discover this new product to the general public only features.
 
We used ingenuity and all our charms to get the most of free advertising.
 

We have developed a website, including a system for fast delivery across Canada, as well as a payment service which is easily and securely accessible through Paypal. www.literietandem.com

We have created a Facebook page that can be visited at ‘literie tandem’ to keep fans informed of events in which we participate, as well as the latest news about our bedding products.
We have been promoted in various radio and television programs. More than a dozen of them have spoken about Tandem bedding free in the context of chronic novelty, original idea or discovery.
We also approached several newspapers and magazines; they have gladly shared information about our new product.
Because we have reached the patent stage with our invention, we have also been invited to participate in different home shows, free of charge, to promote our product.
 
We have also tried to obtain government grants, but currently none apply.
 
Despite our best efforts, we need greater visibility to create a demand strong enough to grow our business. We are at the point where we need to make ads that will affect a wide audience. Our aim is to have the financial capability to produce television advertising which will air during primetime over an extended period. This amount would allow us to produce our first television advertisement and air it for a period of about one month. We hope that this television advertising will entice potential customers and will allow us to continue to promote our product with the capital generated from the presumed increased sales.
We truly need and appreciate any help you can offer. Your support will allow our company to be known across Canada.
Give what you can - every dollar counts! Demonstrate the power of the whole community. Supporting our small business and giving us the chance to grow will allow us to pay it forward in the future by creating new jobs in our community and increasing the wealth of our country as a whole!
You can also support us by talking about our product to your family, colleagues and friends! Word of mouth can do wonders for a small business like ours. A simple discussion between friends or on social networks is a great way for us to become known. If one person speaks to two, the latter two will reach four and those four people may reach eight… this can easily become exponential exposure for us.
 
Thank you very much to all of you.
 
In exchange for your donation, you will receive;
Our Tandem bedding set is an original idea that you will not find in any other bedding set. The fabrics have been carefully selected for their unique features... Available in a solid neutral color, they match any decor. They have clean lines and an urban look.
We are pleased to thank you for your great generosity by offering you a special gift, only available for the duration of this promotion. We want to add a touch of flair to your bedding sets so they stand out even more!
For this occasion, we have specially created a limited edition hand-painted pillowcase made by a professional Canadian art painter.
We have created five unique designs and have individually hand-painted the cuffs of each pillowcase that you will receive as a gift. With this design element, the cases become a decorative element for your traditional bed. The pillows can now mingle with your decorative cushions and eliminate the need to store them in the morning.

Our history:
It all started over 15 years ago by one of the two founders of the company, Josée. She was in a relationship and when it came time to sleep, it was like Groundhog Day ... During the winter her spouse was always opening the window for cool and fresh air and did not want to replace the cotton sheets by a set of flannel ones. This was the only way he was able to sleep and enjoy a full night's sleep. It was the same story in summer ... the air-conditioning was ever present in the room and lightweight cotton sheets kept everything cool at night. The problem then became that Josée was chill all year long. Despite the addition of warm blanket over the sheets, the comfort just wasn’t there. There was more heat as her body acclimated to the sheets but the initial brush of the cotton was still cold. The sheets moved throughout the night and made it difficult and tedious to make the bed in the morning. As a result, Josée slept poorly. One frustrated morning, an idea hit: “One day I'm going to invent sheets that are half and half so we both sleep well!""
That day has finally come fifteen years later. The desire to start up the company was intriguing but nearly impossible to accomplish on her own.  In 2011 Josée discussed the concept with her sister Manon who decided to join the project has a financial partner. Josée, who is already working full-time in her trade, jumped into overdrive. Manon had worked in sales for 23 years, and had a bachelor and a master's degree in microbiology. Josée had a diploma in mechanical building and worked in the industry for 18 years, but in recent years, was known as a art painter sold across Canada.

Literie Tandem est une compagnie entièrement québécoise, inventeur d’un tout nouvel ensemble de literie spécialisé pour les couples qui, quand vient l’heure du coucher, n’ont pas la même tolérance au froid et à la chaleur. Afin de satisfaire les deux occupants d’un même lit, le drap contour et le drap plat d’un côté du lit sont en flanelle chaude, tandis que l’autre côté du lit est en coton léger et frais.
D’une idée, vient un rêve et le début d’une grande aventure pour deux sœurs qui décident de s’affilier pour créer un projet d’entreprise. Énormément d’investissement de temps, d’énergie et d’argent a été consacré à la mise en place, la recherche des matières, l’élaboration et la conception des ensembles de literie Tandem. Nous avons révolutionné le monde de la literie avec un produit à la grandeur de nos exigences, de niveau de conception supérieure, une literie de très haute qualité, et ce, à prix abordable.
Un an et demi s’est écoulés depuis le début de notre belle aventure et nous avons en main notre produit final depuis maintenant un an, mais malgré notre énergie débordante et notre étonnante volonté de foncer, notre projet stagne faute de ressource financière. Un produit, aussi exceptionnel qu’il soit, ne peut trouver sa place sur le marché sans une campagne de publicité pour l’appuyer et le faire connaître aux consommateurs. Puisque les coûts de publicité sont très élevés, nous sommes à la recherche de fond pour nous aider à obtenir la visibilité nécessaire pour faire sortir les ensembles de literie Tandem de l’ombre.

Une couture longitudinale assure la jonction de deux tissus spécialement sélectionnés pour leurs caractéristiques différentes l'un de l'autre soit;

Le drap plat et le drap contour d’un côté du lit EN COTON 100 % léger et frais permettant la circulation de l’air et de l’humidité pour vous garder au frais.
 

Le drap plat et le drap contour de l’autre côté du lit EN FLANELLE chaude et réconfortante vous enveloppe et vous garde bien au chaud.                                                                          
 

Chaque individu conserve ainsi son propre confort peut importe sa tolérance au froid ou à la chaleur, tout en partageant exactement le même environnement à l’heure du coucher. L’ensemble étant réversible du coté droit ou gauche afin de respecter votre côté préféré.

Nous avons conçu notre site internet, incluant un système de livraison rapide à travers le Canada ainsi qu’un service de paiement facile et sécuritaire par Paypal. www.literietandem.com

Nous avons créé notre page Facebook que vous pouvez visiter sur literie tandem, afin de vous tenir au courant des évènements auxquels nous prenons part, ainsi que les nouvelles les plus récentes concernant notre literie
Nous avons rejoint et fait connaître notre literie à diverses émissions radiophonique et télévisuelle. Plus d’une dizaine d’entre eux en ont parlé dans le cadre de chronique de nouveauté, d’idée cadeau originale ou de trouvaille.
Nous avons également approché plusieurs journaux et revues qui ont avec plaisir partagé l’information sur notre nouveau produit.
Puisque que nous sommes en processus de brevet avec notre invention, nous avons également été invités à participer à différent salon de l’habitation afin de promouvoir gratuitement notre produit.
 
Nous avons également tenté d’obtenir des subventions gouvernementales, mais aucune ne s’applique.
 
Malgré tous nos efforts, nous avons besoin d’une plus grande visibilité pour créer « la » demande assez forte pour faire progresser notre entreprise. Nous sommes au point où nous devons faire des publicités qui toucheraient à un très large auditoire. Notre objectif est d’avoir la capacité financière de faire produire une publicité télévisée, et également de la faire voir sur des chaînes télévisées de grande écoute, et ce pour une période prolongée. Cette somme nous permettrait de faire produire notre première publicité télévisée et de la faire diffuser pour une période d’environ un mois. Nous espérons que le roulement ainsi apporté nous permettrait ensuite de poursuivre nous même notre promotion avec notre propre fonds de roulement.
 
Nous avons vraiment besoin de vous, votre soutien nous permettra de lancer notre compagnie à travers tout le Canada.
 
Donnez ce que vous pouvez – chaque dollar compte ! Démontrons ensemble le pouvoir de la collectivité. En supportant notre petite entreprise, vous lui donnez la chance de devenir plus grande, et ainsi nous pourrons également redonner au suivant en créant de nouveaux emplois dans notre communauté tout en augmentant la richesse de notre pays !!
Vous pouvez également nous soutenir en parlant de notre produit à vos parents, collèges et amis ! Une simple discussion entre ami ou sur les réseaux sociaux est une belle publicité pour nous. Une personne qui en parle à deux, ces deux derniers qui en parlent à quatre, quatre personnes qui en parlent à huit, c’est exponentiel et excellent pour nous faire connaître. 
 
Merci infiniment à vous tous.

Notre histoire :
Tout a commencé il y a plus de 15 ans par une des deux fondatrices de la compagnie, soit Josée. Elle est en couple, et quand vient l’heure du couché, c’est le jour de la marmotte…en hiver son conjoint qui a toujours chaud ouvrait la fenêtre pour plus de fraîcheur et ne voulait pas remplacer les draps de coton par un ensemble de flanelle. Il n’y avait que de cette façon qu’il arrivait à bien s’endormir et à profiter d’une nuit complète de sommeil réparateur. Un peu le même principe en été…l’air climatisée très présente dans la chambre et les draps de coton glacés et légers le garde au frais la nuit. Le problème se transfert donc du côté de Josée qui est frileuse. Malgré l’ajout de couverture chaude par-dessus les draps, le confort n’y est pas. Il y a plus de chaleur mais les draps de coton restent quand même glacés. Les draps se déplacent, c’est long à faire le lit le matin, elle dort mal et ne profite pas au maximum de ses heures de sommeil. Elle lui lance… « un jour j’vais inventer des draps qui seront moitié moitié pour qu’on dorme bien tous les deux !!!» 
Ce jour est donc venu une quinzaine d’années plus tard. L’envie de se lancer est intéressante, mais seule c’est impossible. Elle en discute en 2011 avec sa sœur Manon qui décide de devenir sa partenaire financière. Josée, qui travaille déjà à temps plein dans son métier, met les bouchées doubles. Manon travail dans la vente depuis 23 ans, elle possède un DEC, un BAC et une maitrise en microbiologie. Josée a un DEC en mécanique du bâtiment, domaine dans lequel elle a travaillé pendant 18 ans, mais est depuis quelques années, artiste peintre vendu dans 5 galeries d’art à travers le Canada.

I normally post on Craigslist offering computer or electronic repairs, however I have not been receiving any replies or calls. I can go on about how rough my life is currently, but the truth is, I am a 'Glass half full' kind of person. There is and will always be other individuals that have life worse that I currently do. But I would have never thought about doing this sort of thing, as I am an individual that likes to help myself. I have a lot of pride in myself and I cringe at the thought of 'cyber-begging'.

I do majority of all the work myself, as I love to learn and get hands on experience. The repairs are from replacing the timing belt, valve adjustment, replacing a few coolant hoses and finding an exhaust leak.

I am not worried about losing the items that I have purchased over the years (furniture, etc) as I will eventually get new items once I am financially stable.

<p>Dunfermline is a picturesque place with a fascinating history, unfortunately due to the trend for town edge shopping at hypermarkets/superstores and online shopping many of the small niche shops and businesses find it impossible to compete.</p>
<p>This situation creates a problem in ancient market cities like Dunfermline because it leaves many shops in the town centre unoccupied and this results in a decline in tourism as the town centre becomes a depressing place to be.</p>
<p>Wiredtowns Limited is a small start-up business with extremely limited financial resources,  we have obtained a small grant from the local council to cover the initial purchase of our software and development cost. (Now Purchased).</p>
<p>By funding this early stage of the development process contributors will also be helping to regenerate a beautiful and historic town, improve the local economy and increase local employment opportunities.</p>
<p>Our plan is then to roll out the system to other towns around Scotland, as our core system is cloud based we can then deploy the system for any location around the world, helping to turn the internet into a meaningful local resource,</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Our campaign is to raise funds to cover the initial 6 months costs of marketing, SEO, staff costs, domain purchase costs, production of promotional goods,  by this time it should become self funding and generate funds via advertising, but initially a great deal of time must be spent creating brand recognition.</p>
<p>We will be offering excellent perks including Bumper stickers, Window stickers, Banner advertisements and various advertising packages unlike a normal static advert the contributors will have their own portal access and can change the advert at any time during the package life time.</p>
<p>All funds raised will be used to promote and run the project during the start-up period. It will then be rolled out to other towns in the area including Kirkcaldy, Glenrothes, St Andrews, Leven and hopefully many other areas.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My vision is to help  reverse the decline in town centres by creating a vibrant online community which showcases the area and encourages visitors to shop in the town centre by offering special deals from every shop and restaurant. Deal vouchers can be obtained from The Zocalo site and used to redeem the special offers when visiting the town centre, each business that participates will offer a minimum of 2 exclusive deals per day via The Zocalo, which they can manage and monitor online via their own portal login.  This will encourage more visitors to visit the town centre, increase growth and stability for the smaller niche companies in the town centre and make the town an interesting and active heart of the community.</p>
<p>We have been working with the local Business Improvement District company and the Local Council and they have shown a great deal of interest in the project, however the assistance they can offer is limited and so we have turned to this community in order to help save another, ""think local act global"" used to be the buzz, we want to start a revolution to save the cultural hearts of communities wherever they are in the world.</p>
<p>We know that some people can't contribute financially, however spreading ideas which then take on a life of their own can change the world so we encourage links to social networks.</p>
<p>If you live in a community that could benefit from our portal solution we would love to hear from you.</p>

<h3>Crafting the best</h3>
<p>As a regular kombucha drinker and someone very coscious about foods, diet and nutrition I felt that there was a shortage of high quality, refreshing, pure kombucha. Kombucha that is easy on the palate, mixes well with cocktails and most importantly, was brewed locally keeping sustainability in mind.</p>
<p>I started brewing my own kombucha and lliterally have never stopped. It transformed my life overnight. Almost, a year and a half later in October 2012 the editors at Food and Wine Magazine called me up. They had heard about Pure Kombucha and wanted me to send over some for an article they might run. They told me they loved it. I was honored and felt my countless time spent perfecting flavors, blends and techniques had finally paid off!</p>
<p>The best part, this is only the beginning!</p>
<h3><img alt=""Kombucha Party Home Brew Kit"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mf231fDzwm1qajxql.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>You could say I am the 'Mother' of Pure Kombucha. A little SCOBY pun there. Why did the SCOBY cross the road? To get to the other tea. Ha!</p>
<p>I am <a href=""http://www.brettcasper.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brett Casper</a>, I love nature and food and the energies associated with the life force we gain through eating and drinking raw living foods. Pure Kombucha is a living beverage brewed with sping water. Rich with probiotics and beneficial acids, it is said to center your chi by creating a positive environment in your digestive system. I personally want to feel good and healthy all the time. Drinking pure kombucha every day really helps me do that.</p>
<p>I spent the last 15 years traveling the world as a professional photographer. Tea has always been a passion. I've been everywhere from afternoon tea in London, to tea houses, shops and ceremonies in Hong Kong, Japan, China, Thailand and Singapore. For thousands of years, these ancient cultures have been drinking tea as a way for people and communities to come together and to also maintain health.</p>
<p>Living in New York City, it's a certain lifestyle to be here. Work obligations, social obligations, drinking obligations, pollution, noise, landlords... Toxins and stress everywhere. It's no good for your skin, health or total well being.</p>
<p>I started drinking kombucha when I was hungover or over ate. It really helped me to feel better, positive and energized. I lost that weighted down feeling and people told me my skin looked younger. Actually, I subsequently stopped over eating and am now mostly vegetarian. I could never give up sushi and raw oysters though! You know, that feeling you get like an aphrodisiac, good kombucha has the same affect. As soon as you drink it you can feel it. Positivity, health and sustainability are the reasons I founded <a href=""http://www.mypureluck.com/#about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PURE LUCK</a> in the first place. Kombucha is one more piece of the bubble.</p>
<p>Have you heard of <a href=""http://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-agriculture/meat-packing-plant-93500-sf-grid-vertical-farm-and-brewery.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Plant</a>, in Chicago?</p>
<h3><strong>Detox Before You Retox</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kombucha</a> is an effervescent <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_%28food%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Fermentation (food)"">fermentation</a> of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_tea"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Sweet tea"">sweetened tea</a> that is used as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_food"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Functional food"">functional food</a>. This sour tasting beverage effectively helps you eliminate toxins before they can be absorbed into your body. It helps you to detoxify before you re-toxify.</p>
<h3>Live a Symbiotic Lifestyle</h3>
<p>The best kind of culture is symbiotic. Our SCOBY's (Symbiotic Culture of Bateria &amp; Yeast) cannot grow without you.</p>
<p>We ask that you support our campaign so we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employ more people!</li>
<li>Produce, educate and distribute to a larger area within NYC = More kombucha drinkers! </li>
<li>Sign a long term lease on a larger space, which requires 4 months rent upfront.</li>
<li>Do the necessary plumbing, RO sytem/ water heater install, electrical work and general construction. </li>
<li>Bokashi Cycle compost system - We want to make compost tea out of tea!</li>
</ul>
<p>We have outgrown our present commercial space and cannot produce enough to meet demand. We will increase production by 6 fold so you can find Pure Kombucha in places like Whole Foods, Dean &amp; Deluca as well as Roebling Tea Room, Lodge, Brooklyn Kitchen, Black Brick cafe etc.</p>
<p>For your much appreciated generous support you have choices to the right here. We are offering amazing deals on tea, kombucha and even coffee!  ---&gt;</p>
<p> <em>PURE LUCK</em>'s mission is to perpetuate ideas of healthy communities and sustainable, innovative, living techniques for the new century.</p>

</div></div>","Crafting the best
As a regular kombucha drinker and someone very coscious about foods, diet and nutrition I felt that there was a shortage of high quality, refreshing, pure kombucha. Kombucha that is easy on the palate, mixes well with cocktails and most importantly, was brewed locally keeping sustainability in mind.
I started brewing my own kombucha and lliterally have never stopped. It transformed my life overnight. Almost, a year and a half later in October 2012 the editors at Food and Wine Magazine called me up. They had heard about Pure Kombucha and wanted me to send over some for an article they might run. They told me they loved it. I was honored and felt my countless time spent perfecting flavors, blends and techniques had finally paid off!
The best part, this is only the beginning!

You could say I am the 'Mother' of Pure Kombucha. A little SCOBY pun there. Why did the SCOBY cross the road? To get to the other tea. Ha!
I am Brett Casper, I love nature and food and the energies associated with the life force we gain through eating and drinking raw living foods. Pure Kombucha is a living beverage brewed with sping water. Rich with probiotics and beneficial acids, it is said to center your chi by creating a positive environment in your digestive system. I personally want to feel good and healthy all the time. Drinking pure kombucha every day really helps me do that.
I spent the last 15 years traveling the world as a professional photographer. Tea has always been a passion. I've been everywhere from afternoon tea in London, to tea houses, shops and ceremonies in Hong Kong, Japan, China, Thailand and Singapore. For thousands of years, these ancient cultures have been drinking tea as a way for people and communities to come together and to also maintain health.
Living in New York City, it's a certain lifestyle to be here. Work obligations, social obligations, drinking obligations, pollution, noise, landlords... Toxins and stress everywhere. It's no good for your skin, health or total well being.
I started drinking kombucha when I was hungover or over ate. It really helped me to feel better, positive and energized. I lost that weighted down feeling and people told me my skin looked younger. Actually, I subsequently stopped over eating and am now mostly vegetarian. I could never give up sushi and raw oysters though! You know, that feeling you get like an aphrodisiac, good kombucha has the same affect. As soon as you drink it you can feel it. Positivity, health and sustainability are the reasons I founded PURE LUCK in the first place. Kombucha is one more piece of the bubble.
Have you heard of The Plant, in Chicago?
Detox Before You Retox
Kombucha is an effervescent fermentation of sweetened tea that is used as a functional food. This sour tasting beverage effectively helps you eliminate toxins before they can be absorbed into your body. It helps you to detoxify before you re-toxify.
Live a Symbiotic Lifestyle
The best kind of culture is symbiotic. Our SCOBY's (Symbiotic Culture of Bateria & Yeast) cannot grow without you.
We ask that you support our campaign so we can:

Employ more people!
Produce, educate and distribute to a larger area within NYC = More kombucha drinkers! 
Sign a long term lease on a larger space, which requires 4 months rent upfront.
Do the necessary plumbing, RO sytem/ water heater install, electrical work and general construction. 
Bokashi Cycle compost system - We want to make compost tea out of tea!

We have outgrown our present commercial space and cannot produce enough to meet demand. We will increase production by 6 fold so you can find Pure Kombucha in places like Whole Foods, Dean & Deluca as well as Roebling Tea Room, Lodge, Brooklyn Kitchen, Black Brick cafe etc.
For your much appreciated generous support you have choices to the right here. We are offering amazing deals on tea, kombucha and even coffee!  --->
 PURE LUCK's mission is to perpetuate ideas of healthy communities and sustainable, innovative, living techniques for the new century.
Please support PURE LUCK. If you can't contribute financially we love, love word of mouth. Tell your friends about us. We will give out some free kombucha in your honor. :)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Martin Kibera, I am born and raised in Kenya.  My home is a slum called Kawangware, which is home to more than one hundred thousand people.  Imagine how many kids live in this small village, almost all whose parents are making less than $5/day.  I make a living by performing as a freestyle footballer, which has given me the opportunity to travel within and outside of Kenya.  I started a soccer and empowerment program for kids in my village as a way to give back to the society.  </li>
<li>The kids in my program lack opportunity due to little money and limited education by their parents.  My program surrounds the kids with positive role models, encourages them to work hard, and nurtures their talent.  We are now raising funds for our boys and girls soccer team to travel to two East Africa tournaments 8-12 hours outside of Nairobi.  This is an opportunity for the kids to learn new soccer and life skills, see their beautiful country, and get mentorship that can guide them through life.  .  , </li>
</ul>
<ul><li>We will deeply appreciate any support because it will make our kids dreams become a reality.  By providing the incentive of travel and competition it teaches them the value of discipline and hard work.   </li></ul>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Since
1979, Tu Casa, Inc. has served child and adult victims of domestic and sexual
violence from throughout the 6 rural counties of the San Luis Valley,
Colorado.<span>  In order to fully reach
its vision of <i>empowering children and
adults to live healthy, violence-free lives</i>, Tu Casa and more than 24 of
its area partners have come together the create the Children’s Advocacy Center
of the San Luis Valley (SLV CAC), a program specifically <b>designed to ensure child abuse victims (primarily child sexual abuse)
are not revictimized by the systems designed to protect them.</b>  </span></p>
<p>Although
Tu Casa’s building still needs to be renovated to house all of the SLV CAC’s
services under one child-friendly roof, the need for the program’s services was
too great to wait – since 2013, Tu Casa’s family advocate and forensic
interviews have served <b>over 90 children
(primarily victims of sexual abuse) and their non-offending caregivers from
throughout the 8,000+ sq. mile region!</b> Support of this program ensures that
children who may or may not have been abused have a VOICE and receive the care
that they NEED and DESERVE.<span>  </span></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>In
order to create and SUSTAIN the SLV CAC, over $840,000 is needed.<span>  GREAT NEWS!  We have already raised 96% of this and NOW need your help to
raise the remaining funds needed to make this VISION A REALITY FOR
OUR CHILDREN.  We have some perks
that might encourage your investment, but hopefully you will get a sense of
being an investor in the healthy lives of the children that need us most.</span></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p><b>In 2011, Alamosa County
child abuse rates were 3 times the Colorado state average!</b><span>  Child abuse victims were forced to
undergo a repetitive interviewing process of up to 6 interviews per disclosure
at either a police department or department of social service, both places that
often time carry negative or scary connotations for children. The nearest
Children’s Advocacy Center was in Pueblo, almost  hours away and often unreachable during winter months.  Couple these inadequate existing
conditions with the fact that the number of adult victims of domestic and
sexual violence continues to increase in the region – as much as 18% per year,
and that 75% of these adult victims reported that their experiences of child
physical, sexual and/or emotional abuse influenced their propensity to engage
in unhealthy adult relationships – <b>WE
HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM!!!!!</b></span></p>
<p>Tu
Casa has a strong history of serving those most vulnerable through the San Luis
Valley region since 1979. <b>Our staff,
volunteers and Board of Directors are dedicated to crossing county lines and
cultural barriers to ensuring victims have access to the services and resources
they so desperately need.<span>  </span></b></p>
<p>Child abuse victims
are more likely to suffer from a variety of physical, emotional and behavioral
problems as a result of their abuse.<span> 
These issues are often further exacerbated when children never receive
mental health care or validation regarding their lack of blame in relation to
their abuse.  <b>We don’t want the children of our community to carry the burden that is
child abuse – we want them to know that they did nothing wrong and that they
can heal and go on to live healthy, violence-free lives.  YOU can help us do that. </b></span></p>

<h3>Short Summary </h3>
<p>My name is Cheryl Graham and I recently graduated from Life Chiropractic College West in Hayward, California. I am living the dream! I have made a career change at 42 years old to serve people and communities to the highest power. I am eager to share the gift of chiropractic with as many people as possible. I want to share the chiropractic philosophy about innate intellegence and the ability to heal from the inside without drugs and surgery, and show how peoples lives can change physically, emotionally, and spiritually under chiropractic care. Part of living this dream involves travelling to Treasure Beach in Jamaica this June to a retreat where i will not only get the opportunity to serve a community but also rejuvenate and heal myself after 4 years of intense grad school. I am beyond excited and inspired about this trip and could really use some help manifesting this dream.</p>
<p>Globalivity is the group of chiropractors and chiropractic students that I will be joining on this retreat. Feel free to check out Globalivity on line if you would like to learn more about this amazng group that brings the much needed chiropractic care to a community in need of this service.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Since I recently graduated and I'm living off student loans, I almost decided not to go on this trip because of the financial stress but realized I have to go. I am being called to do this and must make it manifest. Thank you for credit cards. lol. I would be beyond grateful for any help and support I receive from this campaign. </p>
<p>My entire trip will cost me around $2800.00 ($1,200 for flight and $1600 for ground transport, food, and lodging), so I have set a goal of $2300.00, which still sounds like a lot of money to ask for because it is hard for me to ask for help. Twenty three is my favorite number and brings me good luck, so that how I decided on $2,300. </p>
<p>I am so inspired and excited about travelling to a country I have not been to, sharing my craft of chiropractic with appreciative families, and to rejuvenate myself with yoga, meditation, delicious organic meals in beautiful Jamaica. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I know everyone is probably financially struggling right now, but any amount you can donate with be so appreciated and will be going to a cause of spreading healing to a much need community which I will then come home rested, on fire, and ready to serve locally. This gives me the opportunity to really honor the choices I have made, truly step into the art of chiropractic, and do what I love-serving and loving. </p>

skateboarding with a variety of activities that involve subjects such

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With
the Skate-House we can ensure that a safe, open and inspiring
environment is established at the Pura Pura Skatepark. We will have
trained personnel present to manage the Skate-House, and we will
provide free-use skateboards and protective gear. This structure will
also be crucial to the establishment of the first official
skate-school in Bolivia. With this building as a home-base, we will
be able to enhance the development of individuals, youth clubs,
communities, and more, along with creating employment opportunities. <br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/375636/files/20140217101831-OKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOK.jpg?1392661111"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p></p><h3>Rewards, Participation, and Support</h3><p>

With
our fundraiser, we, the Bolivian skate club ""Asociación de
Skateboard de La Paz"", and ""MAKE LIFE SKATE LIFE"", a
registered German NGO, aim to construct the Skate-House Community
Center for the upcoming Pura Pura Skatepark. All funds raised will be
used for local building materials along with the workforce for the
construction of the Skate-House. 

The Pura Pura Skatepark
Pura
Pura is a forested ecological and recreational park in La Paz,
Bolivia, accessible to both the City of La Paz and the adjacent City
of El Alto. The skatepark will be built from the 28th of March until
the 19th of April 2014 with the help of an international team of
volunteer skatepark constructors, and which could not have been
possible without the vital support of Levi’s Skateboarding and the
City of La Paz. 
Why the Skate-House Community Center at the Pura Pura Skatepark?
We
feel that skateboarding can positively impact the life of young
people and children. At the Pura Pura Skatepark, we want to combine
skateboarding with a variety of activities that involve subjects such
as languages and literacy,
arts/craftsmanship, and environmental awareness.A Skate-House for a Lasting Impact at the Pura Pura Skatepark!
With
the Skate-House we can ensure that a safe, open and inspiring
environment is established at the Pura Pura Skatepark. We will have
trained personnel present to manage the Skate-House, and we will
provide free-use skateboards and protective gear. This structure will
also be crucial to the establishment of the first official
skate-school in Bolivia. With this building as a home-base, we will
be able to enhance the development of individuals, youth clubs,
communities, and more, along with creating employment opportunities. Rewards, Participation, and Support
As a thank you
to donors, we are offering original t-shirts, skateboards, and
various traditional Bolivian clothing, textiles and accessories (e.g.
hats, purses, scarves, finger puppets for children, alpaca wool
sweaters and ponchos). 

A special thank you goes out to The Directorate of
Sports of the Autonomous Municipal Government of La Paz - who shares
our vision for the Pura Pura Skatepark, to Levi’s Skateboarding -
the sponsor of the “Builder’s Jam” for the skatepark build, to
skate-aid - who is making skate and safety gear available, and to
Lovenskate from the UK - who is producing our Pura Pura Campaign
t-shirts and skateboards.
Thank you very much for your interest in our
campaign, for your contribution, for volunteering on site, for
supporting our cause in any imaginable way, and for spreading the
word.
We are looking forward to your involvement in
this project and hope to see you in La Paz!

<p> Hello, I am Amie Cuhaciyan a single mom and an avid traveler who has worked and played in Japan. After getting the itch to travel to Japan again I was shocked to see how much tours in Japan cost and decided that I could offer a much deeper experience at a far friendlier cost. I hate guided tours, so I wanted to offer something different. My staff and I will be there for you but we will give you enough room and time to explore on your own. I believe that a bit of the unknown is a really important aspect of immersing yourself in an experience. By having a guide take you somewhere, but giving you the freedom to explore what interests you makes a richer more personalized experience. It also puts the explorer in touch with the locals more and you never know who you might bump into or what you may find!</p>
<p> The first tour I would like to offer would take you from Tokyo to the Mountain town of Hida Takayama where the beef is the best you can get (move over Kobe beef!) and the atmosphere is of the Edo period. Then we go to Shizuoka prefecture to see great views of Mt. Fuji, see where Tokugawa used to reside and have a relaxing day at a seaside hot spring resort before heading back to Tokyo. All breakfasts and half 2 dinners and traditional sweets and tea at Tora-ya included.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Travel Itinerary</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/><strong>Day 1</strong></strong>: Your arrival to Narita Airport! Welcome to Japan. You will be met at the airport and taken to the hotel. The night is yours to explore.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2</strong>: Spend the morning in Asakusa and visit Senoji Temple. We will then head to the Ginza, and Tora-ya for some Wagashi and tea.  After which you will have free time to do as your heart desires.</p>
<p><strong>Day 3</strong> : We will see faith full Hachiko at Shibuya station before taking the bullet train as we head to Gero onsen.  Once we get to the onsen, the day is yours to rest and walk around as you please. </p>
<p><strong>Day 4</strong>: Take a short jaunt to Hida Takayama. You will be given a layout of the town and given the option to head out on your own or follow your guide as she checks out the local sake shop, temples, merchant’s houses and shops. (Don't miss out on the Hida Beef Buns!) Other options include hiking, seeing the floats museum and visit Shirakawa-go a beautiful world heritage site. At night you can enjoy the onsen and local delicacies.</p>
<p><strong>Day 5</strong> : Head out to the morning market before heading to Shizuoka. In Shizuoka we will take in Sunpu Park the home of Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. We will head to Miho no Matsubara the home of the Tennyo Legend. There you will see grand Mt.Fuji in its entire splendor. The afternoon will be spent in Shimizu exploring the Ginza and getting some of the freshiest Sushi. Shimizu is known for its Maguro Tuna. </p>
<p><strong>Day 6</strong>: We will head to Okitsu or Abe-kawa, depending on people's preference. I am trying to secure some time to visit Shizuhatayaki ( a famous potter in the area known for its demon and goddess cups). In the early afternoon we will head for out last stop; Izu kogen and stay at a beautiful Ryokan and have delicious Kaiseki. Enjoy the atmosphere and the onsen.</p>
<p><strong>Day 7</strong>: Head home. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tours in the works:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>I am happy to now offer a day trip to Shizuoka, the prefecture that is home to Mt. Fuji, with host mom and guide Keiko, who will take you around to a couple of hot spots and make you dinner!</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Pick up and drop off from Shizuoka station limited to 4 people once a month</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A food tour including the major 5 foods tempura, sushi, soba, udon and ramen. Plus much more</li>
<li>A handi-capable tour for thoes with special needs especially wheel chair accessable.</li>
<li>A spiritual tour: includes spending the night at temples, some of the most holy spots in Japan and possible Reiki healings</li>
<li>Also regional tours including a northen tour, a southern tour and a grand tour of Japan from top to bottom!</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Funding will be going towards set up cost of the business such as website development, advertising, and the upfront cost to travel with the first tour group I put together.  I will also need to be in Japan to hire a tour guide and want to pay them a livable wage. </p>
<p>Our unique perks include a small gift, travel consultations, and heavily discounted travel.</p>
<p>If the goal of $4000 isn't reached the funds will be going to licensing and liability insurance in addition to website development if possible. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Japan is a country I fell in love with and I want to share that love with others in an affordable way. The shocking 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami has taken a toll on tourism in Japan and I have had people ask me if it is safe enough to visit. The answer is YES! We should visit and show our support which will help Japan economically to rebuild what was lost. With that I would like to donate a percent of my profit to Peace Winds Japan as I have personally donated with them before and believe in their work to help Tohoku recover. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p> Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Indiegogo has great share tools so please take a second to tell everyone you know about us!</p>

<p>By way of introduction, I’m a retired USAF non-commissioned officer who is passionate about mass media. For the last 12 years I had been involved in the  publishing business, but last year I decided I wanted to do something about helping people save money on their prescription drug cost.</p>
<p>I found a major PBM (Pharmacy Benefits Manager) who agreed to provide their Pharmacy Discount Card to consumers at NO cost, NO Sign-up, NO restrictions, and of course, NO gimmicks. To date, we’ve saved consumers over $30,000.</p>
<p>I am especially excited about this opportunity with Indiegogo and this campaign to provide 1,000,000 Free Pharmacy Discount Cards at No Cost to consumers. These cards are not insurance. But, they allow cardholders to save up-to 85% off the cost of their prescriptions.</p>
<p>This campaign allows humanity to stand up for things we believe in – like, helping those who can least afford to pay for their prescriptions. I remember an aunt, cutting her pills in half because she couldn’t afford the whole pill on a daily basis. My aunt has long since died, but the memory haunts me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>To meet our goal of making 1,000,000 Free Pharmacy Discount Cards here’s what we need: $12,500 for the printing of high quality UV coated 14 pt cards. Another 12,500 for about 1,200 man hours in fabricating our Free Take-one Card holders which we will place in hospitals, medical centers, doctor offices, dental clinics, rec centers, Senior day care centers and the like. Finally, we’ll need about $25,000 to pay trained distributors, $1 for each card holder they place.</p>
<p>These 1,000,000 cards will be available in some 25,000 locations when completed. Should this campaign fall short of our goal, all the funds raised will be put to use on the same basis as $1,000 per 20,000 Free Pharmacy Discount Card.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Healthcare is a hot-button issue these days, and millions of people find it increasingly difficult to address rising medical and insurance costs. Yet many are unaware that help is readily available in the form of a Free Pharmacy Discount Cards. Cards that are free, require no forms, have no limits, are available to all, and could net an average savings of 24 percent or more on a card holder’s annual prescriptions is all about telling-not selling. The [Neylandville Healthco] Free Pharmacy Discount Cards created by our PBM partner – is not an insurance plan, as is similar pharmacy benefit cards but like other similar pharmacy benefit cards they are accepted at over 60,000 pharmacies nationwide. There are no age or income restrictions. It cannot be used in conjunction with a cardholder’s insurance plan, but it can provide significant savings on prescriptions that insurance doesn’t cover. This is particularly good news for everyone, especially for seniors as the prescription card can help fill gaps left by Medicare.</p>
<p>Our success has been made evident is the progress we have made over the last year. With over 200,000 Free Pharmacy Discount Cards in 8 states across America, we’ve not waited to be about our business of helping people.</p>
<p>As a former airman, I understand the importance of team building and commitment to a task. If you donate over $100 we will send you a blue baseball cap with our logo.</p>

Although a citizen of the United States of America, for health and economic
reasons I am currently living in Bali, Indonesia. I have a background in
Accounting, Business Management, Teaching, Website Creation and Management, and
have written and published a travel memoir. 
 After several trips to
Amed, East Bali, I feel compelled to help a family of 11 that I have met in desperate
need of assistance. At the age of 32, Wayan is solely responsible for
providing for his family. A family of eleven: himself, his wife, and 3
daughters, his mother and father, his grandmother and grandfather, and his
younger brother and sister.  It is up to him to provide food for all, as well as, money to pay for his brother’s and his daughter’s education. 
Wayan is a fisherman without a
boat. The other fisherman, in his small village in economically depressed East Bali, keep his space on
the beach open in the hopes that he will someday be able to buy another fishing
boat and be able to once again provide a humble existance for his family.

<p><br/></p></div>","Who We Are

Island Tree, LLC was established in 2011 by U.S. Navy veteran and entrepreneur Antonio Harris and Brandon Allen. The company was created to develop energy drinks and brands that cater to those that seek a healthier alternative to the highly caffeinated, and overly sugared products that have flooded today’s market. With more and more people understanding that what we put in our bodies can affect our moods, mental and physical health consumers are seeking products that fuel the body, mind and spirit in a healthier, more natural way. Our company is dedicated to providing functional beverages that satisfy our customers’ needs, while understanding the need to promote health. It is our commitment to ensure that product quality, customer service, and health awareness are goals that are constantly met in each product we create.
 
What We Sell
 Island Tree’s primary focus is to create great tasting, market friendly, all natural beverage brands. Komodo Natural Energizer will be the first of many great brands to be developed by Island Tree, LLC. We strongly believe it is important consumers have beverage options that are truly healthy and appealing in taste. The Island Tree team is convinced that our products will resonate with those who chose to live a health conscious lifestyle. We are confident that this strategy will create a market trend that employs a focus on beverage functionality, natural ingredients, and overall calorie consumption. We also feel that since our first product Komodo Natural Energizer will be made from all natural ingredients, such as coconut water and carbonated spring water, our product will minimize certain risks associated with “over consumption”. Island Tree will operate as a Limited Liability Company, and will be managed by Antonio Harris (CEO) and Brandon Allen (COO). 
 Who We Sell To
The Komodo brand will concentrate on the downtown areas in the Chicago, IL region and also the Minneapolis, MN region. We chose these specific areas because of the ample amount of resources with store owners, and distributers in the region. We would also like to utilize the tourism sector in the region, which will play a vital role in the best type of advertising ""word of mouth"". We have verbal commitments from stores such as Walgreens, CVS, LA Fitness, and Target along with various independently owned stores. Our main focus is adults between the ages of 21-32yrs old who are active, working professionals seeking a healthier lifestyle.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Her sleep is interrupted each time the bus gets to the end of the line.  20 minutes shivering outside in the cold  and then back on the bus to sleep. She gets to WGP eats lunch and retreats to the fireside room for a couple of hours of uninterrupted sleep,
Sadly another comes with bruises on her arms and neck and tells her story of going to a motel room with someone she didn't know very well because she was so exhausted. When she refused his advances her exhaustion was replaced with a lifelong trauma. We offered her support and paid for a motel to give her time to disengage and connect with a DV shelter.
A woman is saving her GA money to return home to Arizona. It will take her months but we were able to pay her way and give her a second chance.
A woman comes to WGP with only the clothing on her back. Her possessions were stolen at her encampment and she hasn't been able to bath in a week. She is able to take a shower, shop at the Ooh La La Boutique and receive a Street Survival Backpack to start afresh.

Short Summary Aloha! I am a young Native Hawaiian woman, and I am asking for your help. I come from a very modest background, when my parents divorced my mother sold everything she owned - and within a week she had a job and managed to put a down payment on an apartment in the building she lives now. It's something that I still can't imagine that she managed to do, and it continually inspires me. Unfortunately, this place of love has been damaged badly.
She eventually remarried several years later, but it wasn't meant to be. Her husband stopped working, began to drink, was mentally and emotionally abusive, and eventually became sexually and physically abusive. When I moved home, I threw him out, and we began repairing everything and everyone he had broken.
They are divorced, but the damage to the house remains and is a constant reminder. He ripped a hole in the bathroom ""intending to fix the plumbing"", but never did. This gaping hole has been here for over six years, and because of that we can't take showers for longer than 5 minutes otherwise the entire apartment will flood and it will go into the apartment below. The mirror is falling out of the wall, and the shelves inside it are broken because of his tantrums, the pan beneath the bathtub is busted (the original plumbing problem he was ""going to fix""). Essentially, the entire bathroom needs to be ripped out and redone.   What We Need & What You Get Since we finally have a reasonable quote (after getting several others), we need at least $15,000 to account for the job itself and incidental work. Anything raised above that amount, will go towards paying off my mother's renal cancer medical bills. Even if we can't reach our goal, it will go towards repairing the bathroom anyway, in a savings account.
Unfortunately we can't afford to give you anything in return, aside from unending gratitude.

  The Impact This home she made for us, started out with very little. We didn't have any furniture, we slept on the floor, sometimes we didn't have food, but we had a home. We have come very far - although her quality of life hovers just above poverty. Unfortunately, I can't stay here forever, I have to leave again. I want to leave knowing that my mom won't have this terrible reminder woven into her every day. I have to leave knowing that she'll be okay.
I stayed so that she would feel safe again, and through the few years I replaced her stove (as the previous one had only one working burner), her refrigerator (which could barely keep anything cool), and helped repair her transportation situation since her ex-husband also completely destroyed her first car, and then her second car. It has been a real struggle. You would be making a huge, real difference in our lives - in her life.

  Risks & Challenges The biggest risks are if we are unable to cover extra labor for working in a building. It is a challenge getting the materials up and down floors, as well as disposing of the excess. There's also the concern if something goes wrong with the plumbing, we may run into an emergency situation.

<p> Creating a SUCCESSFUL website is EXPENSIVE! Who knew???? Probably everyone but me. I thought it would be alot of work but WOW. I CLEARLY had no idea what I was doing and had alot to learn and right now my website sucks compared to others on the same topic, I am a bookkeeper in my everday job, but after a looney arsonist burned down my place of employment TWICE in 6 months <a href=""http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8737458"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8737458</a> I thought ""hmmmm maybe I better concentrate a little more on my website""</p>
<p>I became involved in clipping coupons to save my family much need money, and it worked! It became a wonderful hobby that also really helped me cut down on our grocery bills and every day use items. The more I learned the more I realized I would love to have my own website to help promote money saving ideas and hopefully make some extra income, some of these couponing websites are VERY popular. I learned everything I could about starting a blog/website (even read blogging for dummies lol) and soon I made a website <a href=""http://www.extremequeenscouponing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.extremequeenscouponing.com</a>. I soon realized that running a website and keeping up with the competition was actually very time consuming (which I don't mind) but also very costly. I am a mother and I have a job (btw my office was burned down twice by arson in the last 6 month, so I have not had time to put 100% in my site, but I am trying to now) I do not mind putting the time into working on my site, but as time went on I became frustrated.....the idea was to hopefully save money and make a little extra money.....not cost an arm and a leg. I realized that I need to update my site and have apps and features that other successful websites have if I am going to ever make anything out of this.</p>
<p>When you go to my website or any coupon website to print a coupon you will be directed to install the coupon printer download, it is not a virus, it will not hurt your computer it just allows you to print the coupons, the coupon printer is what puts the barcode for the discount on your coupon.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For every 36 coupons prinited from my website I earn approx. $1.00, if a few people print I will have hit my goal in now time.</p>
<p>Here is where I am asking for support and help.......a monetary donoation is greatly appreciated, but the best way for me to raise the money to update my website and it will not cost anyone any money out of pocket is for the people to go to my web page <a href=""http://www.extremequeenscouponing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.extremequeenscouponing.com</a> and print coupons, its free, you get a coupon for hopefully something you need and I am paid a small commission on every coupon printed,there are links on the sidebar of my site (the blue coupon bar is the best one) it really is only pennies but pennies add up and the more coupons printed the more money I earn to add costly features like printable lists, easier navagation buttons (some of these add on features are 400-500 dollars) and can update my site enough to be desirable, benefical and successful. Right now the site everages about $19.00 a month :(, a far cry from making enough for upgrades and make the site much more useful.</p>
<p>I would love to add coupon databases, a section for DYI crafts and projects, Recipes, and of course money saving links of all kinds, my passion is to see this webite graow and succeed to its best place possible.</p>
<p>I have read through so many of the campaigns, and they are all in great need of help, some are truly heartbreaking, I wish I could contribute to every one of them, so hopefully my campaign will raise money for my site, but not take away from some else in need, its just a click away and FREE </p>

<p>When we opened our truck in 2010, we were the first gourmet food truck in Ontario.  We quit our jobs, invested our savings, and borrowed money from family and friends to stay afloat.  We couldn’t afford the bells and whistles you see on some trucks today, like plasma televisions, wifi, and custom-fitted quiet generators.  So, for the past three years, we’ve been lugging around a cheap, loud, heavy, ugly beast of a genny.  We’d like to apologize for that.  We want you to eat your fish tacos and gourmet street food in peace, and we’ve let you down.</p>
<p><img alt=""Generator"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UhQxt5PFHxW5R5O_DIOKuHFiSQO76qvE5zbj8wQDD4A=w332-h186-p-no"" src="""" style="""" title=""Generator""/></p>
<p>We’ve put every penny we’ve earned back into the business and to lobbying for street food freedom in Ontario, which is why we need your help.  We'll hook you up with everything from free food to tees, secret recipes, private cooking classes, and an all-you-can-eat food truck feast for you and your friends!  You've kept us trucking longer than any other gourmet food truck in Ontario, and it's time for us to spread the love and shower you with perks!</p>
<p><img alt=""Shower of perks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ACs58wOQBzjs51X0g0hkX61jdxkR6vrkKTJDC4Sw9lU=w379-h213-p-no"" src="""" style="""" title=""Shower of perks""/></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p>
<p>A generator isn't glamourous.  You won't be able to see it.  You'll barely be able to hear it, but you will feel it!  We'll be free to move around to even more locations, participate in more events, and focus our energy on delivering the best gourmet street food possible.  In order to do that, we're asking for your help to raise $10,000. </p>
<p>. . . that's a lot of tacos.  <strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>To source and custom-fit the new generator, we'll work with the magical Mr. Mike Pitton, meat smoker extraordinaire and monkey wrench-wielding mechanic behind Hamilton's <a href=""http://www.southernsmoketruck.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Southern Smoke Truck"">Southern Smoke Truck</a>.  Mike's giving us a great deal on his hard work, but he can't control the cost of the genny and custom parts - a whopping $6,000 to $8,000! </p>
<p><img alt=""Mike Pitton of Southern Smoke Truck"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kL5XjMGSeSjwaJD5R_zLSd5lZL7PoG0KmE9LChOgqvw=w305-h220-p-no"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mike Pitton of Southern Smoke Truck""/></p>
<p>So where's the rest of the $10,000 going, you ask?  Well, we want to reward your contributions with the best perks possible, and those cost real cash; also, the truck will be off the road while Mike works his magic, which means no fish taco sales to help us pay the bills.</p>
<p>So what will you get for helping us out?  Let's check out the perks:</p>
<p><strong>Growling Howler! $10</strong></p>
<p>You'll get a heartfelt thank you on twitter from @elgastronomo, and listed on our website as a true El Gastronaut!</p>
<p><strong>Fish Tacos! Fish Tacos! $25</strong></p>

When we opened our truck in 2010, we were the first gourmet food truck in Ontario.  We quit our jobs, invested our savings, and borrowed money from family and friends to stay afloat.  We couldn’t afford the bells and whistles you see on some trucks today, like plasma televisions, wifi, and custom-fitted quiet generators.  So, for the past three years, we’ve been lugging around a cheap, loud, heavy, ugly beast of a genny.  We’d like to apologize for that.  We want you to eat your fish tacos and gourmet street food in peace, and we’ve let you down.

We’ve put every penny we’ve earned back into the business and to lobbying for street food freedom in Ontario, which is why we need your help.  We'll hook you up with everything from free food to tees, secret recipes, private cooking classes, and an all-you-can-eat food truck feast for you and your friends!  You've kept us trucking longer than any other gourmet food truck in Ontario, and it's time for us to spread the love and shower you with perks!

What We Need & What You'll Get
A generator isn't glamourous.  You won't be able to see it.  You'll barely be able to hear it, but you will feel it!  We'll be free to move around to even more locations, participate in more events, and focus our energy on delivering the best gourmet street food possible.  In order to do that, we're asking for your help to raise $10,000. 
. . . that's a lot of tacos.  
To source and custom-fit the new generator, we'll work with the magical Mr. Mike Pitton, meat smoker extraordinaire and monkey wrench-wielding mechanic behind Hamilton's Southern Smoke Truck.  Mike's giving us a great deal on his hard work, but he can't control the cost of the genny and custom parts - a whopping $6,000 to $8,000! 

So where's the rest of the $10,000 going, you ask?  Well, we want to reward your contributions with the best perks possible, and those cost real cash; also, the truck will be off the road while Mike works his magic, which means no fish taco sales to help us pay the bills.
So what will you get for helping us out?  Let's check out the perks:
Growling Howler! $10
You'll get a heartfelt thank you on twitter from @elgastronomo, and listed on our website as a true El Gastronaut!
Fish Tacos! Fish Tacos! $25
Choose any one item off the menu at the truck, and it's yours! You'll also get a heartfelt thank you on twitter from @elgastronomo, and listed on our website as a true El Gastronaut!

<p>In addition to being an entertainment site, Online Celebrity
Idol also exists to promote positive messages for youth and will work actively
towards helping local causes. These include young single mothers struggling to
provide for children, veteran unemployment, and youth programs—donation buttons
will be present throughout the site and may include incentives. User accounts on our website will also be able to accumulate special features including virtual “credits” that can be exchanged for uniquely designed profile layouts, Celebrity Idol merchandise, and special account status.<br/><br/>Special account statuses will be identified by small graphics in the upper corner of a user’s profile.

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, this website’s main goal
is to steer youth away from violence by providing a safe environment and by
teaching about music and all walks of life. The online donation buttons are a
large part of this: Members can choose to have donation buttons on their
profiles that lead to specific causes.</p>

Users can choose to have their donate button lead to have a certain cause, as well!

<p>Online Celebrity isn’t only a social media website. A
youth-friendly nightclub will also be constructed and maintained – members
only. Here, local celebrity guests will perform on-stage and be broadcast to
the website for those who aren’t in the area. A safe alternative to clubbing,
the Entertainment Center will have a party atmosphere while still being very
much integrated into the website.</p>

ways via Online Celebrity Idol’s social media features.</p>

<p>We’re looking to raise at least $800,000 to get the ball
rolling on this project. These funds will take care of the setup of the website,
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) so that people can find us, the renting and
furnishing of a space for our Entertainment Center, and finally, hiring local
celebrities to take part in our community.</p>
<p>As Online Celebrity Idol grows, we will progressively be
able to make our website bigger and better, our nightclub more exclusive, and
attract bigger celebrities to our services. For now, we need your help to get
started!</p><p>If you’re worried about what will happen if we don’t reach our goal, there’s no reason to be! The funding strategies behind this campaign will ensure that, even if we do not receive the full $800 000 we are aiming for, the project will go on, and all contributors will receive what they signed up for. Our dedicated team will ensure that, even if we have to build from the bottom up, Online Celebrity Idol will be built and implemented.<br/><br/>In the worst-case scenario (raising less than half of our goal), the construction of the Entertainment Center will be postponed until the website generates sufficient profit, but we are confident that with your help and our current funding strategies, we will be able to amass the funding we need to implement the whole project at once.<br/><br/>We’ve developed a brand-new funding strategy designed specifically for this type of social media. Projections show that the site will be able to gross up to $30 Million a month, playing off of the views brought from celebrity guests and using our previously mentioned strategies.<br/><br/>The user accounts of the website <br/></p>

well as various other merchandise and bonuses. Please take a look along the

is to steer youth away from violence by providing a safe environment and by
teaching about music and all walks of life. The online donation buttons are a
large part of this: Members can choose to have donation buttons on their
profiles that lead to specific causes.

Users can choose to have their donate button lead to have a certain cause, as well!


Online Celebrity isn’t only a social media website. A
youth-friendly nightclub will also be constructed and maintained – members
only. Here, local celebrity guests will perform on-stage and be broadcast to
the website for those who aren’t in the area. A safe alternative to clubbing,
the Entertainment Center will have a party atmosphere while still being very
much integrated into the website.


Celebrities will also engage in online Q-and-A’s,
collaborations, and be encouraged to interact with their fans in many unique
ways via Online Celebrity Idol’s social media features.

We’re looking to raise at least $800,000 to get the ball
rolling on this project. These funds will take care of the setup of the website,
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) so that people can find us, the renting and
furnishing of a space for our Entertainment Center, and finally, hiring local
celebrities to take part in our community.
As Online Celebrity Idol grows, we will progressively be
able to make our website bigger and better, our nightclub more exclusive, and
attract bigger celebrities to our services. For now, we need your help to get
started!If you’re worried about what will happen if we don’t reach our goal, there’s no reason to be! The funding strategies behind this campaign will ensure that, even if we do not receive the full $800 000 we are aiming for, the project will go on, and all contributors will receive what they signed up for. Our dedicated team will ensure that, even if we have to build from the bottom up, Online Celebrity Idol will be built and implemented.In the worst-case scenario (raising less than half of our goal), the construction of the Entertainment Center will be postponed until the website generates sufficient profit, but we are confident that with your help and our current funding strategies, we will be able to amass the funding we need to implement the whole project at once.We’ve developed a brand-new funding strategy designed specifically for this type of social media. Projections show that the site will be able to gross up to $30 Million a month, playing off of the views brought from celebrity guests and using our previously mentioned strategies.The user accounts of the website 
Donating to this
campaign will get you exclusive membership perks once the service is live, as
well as various other merchandise and bonuses. Please take a look along the
right side of the campaign!

The brainchild of Mark Brown, aspiring entrepreneur from New
York, Online Celebrity Idol is backed by a team of determined supporters and
future staff.
We’re looking forward to undertaking the design,
construction, moderating, and organizing that this project will take to become
a reality. We hope that you’ll consider joining us!

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Who Are We?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The story begins where self-taught inventor Aaron Imhof, meets Kate Wildrick, a down and out entrepreneur.  Together they find themselves starting over in a 300 square foot apartment above a theater in the inner southeast area of Portland, Oregon. As Kate struggles to deal with the loss of owning and operating a town (Service Creek, Population 2) in Central Oregon, Aaron soon finds himself on the roller coaster of finding steady employment, while struggling to learn how create inventions with limited resources.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>One evening, Aaron challenged a friend (and physicist) around the concept of possible energy solutions.  After hearing the case, the friend exclaimed, ""that is not possible!  You don't know what you are talking about.  You need to go to school.  I have a degree and what you are saying is breaking the second law of thermodynamics.""</span> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Frustrated, Aaron crowdsourced $60 to build a successful prototype.  What followed afterwards surprised both Kate and Aaron.  Inventors, engineers, electricians and countless others came out to see what he had created.  To their dismay, they watched as many scholars discounted what they saw saying it wasn't possible.  Folks that had no experience with energy were stoked and saw the possibilities.  It was at that point, Kate and Aaron decided to embark on a new adventure of building an innovation center to develop a new way to think and connect the community.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>The Ingenuity Innovation Center</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Ingenuity Innovation Center is creating community-based solutions that focuses on sustainable practices. Everything we develop and build is shared using an open source platform. We are situated on 20 acres in St. Helens, Oregon.  We moved here in September 2012.  We have two homes, two shops and one new building that now serves as the innovation center.  We believe that by bringing together from all backgrounds and generations, that together we can create and discover better ways to live and thrive.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Why Create a Community-Based Innovation Center?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Let's face it, a lot is happening in our world that is not sustainable.  Virtually every system (economic, educational, health care, environmental, etc.) is greatly impacting the health and well-being of all inhabitants of this planet.  In order to create effective solutions that are greatly needed now, we believe it is going to take every person to share their unique gift and insight to help dream and create better ways of living.  What better way than by creating a space where people of all ages and interests can gather to connect, learn and innovate?</span></p>
<h3><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Our Goal is to Develop “Whole-System” Thinkers</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We recognize that people have received a lot of social programming around competition and scarcity.  However, what would our world look and feel like if collaboration and abundance were the norm?  What if our own personal value wasn’t tied to systems that are creating havoc in our health and well-being?  Where your participation felt like a contribution to health instead of selling out?  What if you could do what you love and be able to thrive?  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We don’t have all the answers to these, but what does remain clear is that in order to make our world a better place, a new way of thinking; whole systems thinking, is needed to ensure what we create is sustainable and designed to benefit all and not just a few.  To develop “whole” thinkers, we are developing a practice area around innovation, with a high level of trust, where it is safe to try on new ideas and learn how to collaborate and work together as a community.</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>The aquaponics model will serve as our first teaching tool to show how whole systems thinking and design can create powerful, abundant solutions.   (After all, who doesn’t love food?)  On a micro level, people can see the direct impact that fish have on the health and well-being of plants.  From a macro perspective, we can explore how our food industry impacts the health and well-being of people and the planet.  Ultimately, people learn what they can do to restore health and well-being to themselves and the world by learning how their choices impact other systems and industries.</span></p>

<h2><strong>About Lauren</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>     My name is Lauren Digioia and I am a 27 year old activist from New York.  For the past year I have been involved with the Occupy Wall St movement .  As a disenfranchised youth, my life before occupy did not involve activism, an interest in politics or world news.  It was not until I discovered Zucotti Park that my eyes were truly opened, not just to the reality of our corrupt political and economic sytem, but to the potential power of people from all walks of life coming together to start a conversation and imagine a better world.  It was through the fearless individuals that I met and the incredible stories, knowledge and energy they shared that I realized the potential of humanity to be alive and well, even in a world where apathy and complacency had become the preferred norm.</strong></h3>
<h2><strong>What I Have Learned</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>     I have learned that despite having access to the endless information resource of the internet and higher education in America, the culprits involved in the destruction of our economy, our nation's health, and the wilderness are not widely known.  However, when we are faced with endless war, staggering numbers of incarcerated and homeless and an unessesary dependence on non-renewable resources, we are presented with a choice;  remain complacent and prefer ignorance as bliss, or allow ourselves the opportunity to learn and become active. It is our awareness of the truth, our buying power and our rights that are our greatest weapons against oppression and exploitation. </strong></h3>
<h2>
<strong> </strong><strong>Our Goal</strong>
</h2>
<h3><strong>     With this traveling ""hub"" we are looking to achieve a positive lasting impression on the people we meet through our example and actions and see that impression in turn inspire more activism in their community.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>HOW WILL WE DO IT? </strong></h3>
<p><strong>We begin every stop with a tour of the bus-we will show those who come aboard how we are living the solution we teach.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>~SERIES OF TEACH-INS</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Below is a list of open-source knowledge that our team has to offer. This is not the final list and more will surely be added as we receive more literature and ideas. These steps aim at creating a more self-empowered collective.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>    ~Power in our pocket: The system is dependent on our choices as consumers-raising conciousness in our decision making as buyers- our purchases become an extension of our views.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>    ~Moving Our Money: Step-by-step how to on moving accounts from big banks to local credit unions. ~movie showing</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>    ~ Debt Resistance: Intro to taking collective action against predatory  collectors-support in breaking down stigma and shame around debt~use of debt resistor's operations manual for medical, student and housing debt.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>    ~Living Sustainably: Beyond going green! Practicing diligence in our everyday lives to leave no trace and move to zero waste. Water catchment, start up gardens, solar panel reclamation, composting, grey water filtration systems.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>    ~Making our own Green Alternative Products: Bath/body/cleaning products on a small budget and even smaller impact on the earth-they also smell amazing!</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>    ~Know Your Rights Training: Vital for everyone! Get to know the justice system and how we can protect ourselves and our civil liberties.</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>     ~Artistic Expression=Liberation: A collection of concerts featuring poetry slams, improvisational musical jams, original works including political parody sing alongs, art &amp; craft hours for kids of all ages, interactive drum circles.</strong></h3>
<h3>
<strong>    ~Book Reading: Select works read aloud from inspiring writers including economists, activists, and professors. Open discussions to follow.</strong><strong><br/></strong>
</h3>
<h3><strong>    ~The People's Think Tank: Topics inspired by you! Engaging discussion on a variety of issues as well as what YOU think are possible solutions to those issues.</strong></h3>

<p><strong> Our skill-shares, teach-ins and performances will always be free and available to everyone. We believe in a ""know one, teach one"" principal. That way we set a standard for others to continue the work we begin.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>~THE POWER OF INDEPENDENT MEDIA</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Part of our campaign is the use of indie journalism to expose corruption, cover events large and small, draw attention to relevant issues and find incredible local stories of inspiration and hope. We are fortunate to have a live streamer on our team who will be filming, blogging, doing live local coverage as well as international news coverage.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>    ~Community Hour: 1 hour segment broadcasting live interviews with community members and bringing local issues to light. This segment has the potential to reach a wide audience through our various social media outlets.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>    ~Daily Live Stream Updates: Check in with where we are in the country, where we are heading next and the overall tour experience. Interviews with the crew.</strong></h3>

<strong> Where Your Contributions Will Go</strong><strong><br/></strong>
</h3>
<h3>
<strong>     The majority of the funds we are asking for is going towards the purchase of an incredible bus, which will carry supplies, food and crew around the country.We need a enviromentally friendly vehicle with thea model for the lifestyle we would like to emulate and one with a cool history.  The key for this campaign being successful is being mobile.  The asking price for the bus is 22,500.  Please visit the link below for all details about the bus. You will quickly see why this is THE bus of our DREAMS!</strong><strong><br/></strong>
</h3>
<h3>     <a href=""http://www.squeakywheeladventures.org/for_sale.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.squeakywheeladventures.org/for_sale.php</a>
</h3>
<h3>     Any funds remaining after the purchase of the bus will be allocated to fuel, medical supplies, disaster relief/daily meals, stocking our library, art &amp; music supplies and multi-media equipment. To ensure full transparency all spending will be documented and open sourced on our facebook page and our website.</h3>
<h2> THE IMPACT</h2>
</div>
<div>
<h3>     The most influential thing we can offer is a chance to bring a more empowering message to people who might not otherwise hear it.  The open sharing of knowledge, experience and ideas can motivate even the most disenfranchised of individuals to come together and create feasible solutions.</h3>
<h3>     Having the ability to travel to various communities throughout the country is crucial. We are not satisfied with the disconnected means of the internet to  bring that message of love, acceptance and self-empowerment. Nothing compares to real human interaction; the intimacy of one on one conversation And hands-on education. Give us that opportunity to share ourselves as a better model for our generation. This bus is the ultimate tool for us to do this work on a large scale. </h3>
<h3>     We know the way we live our lives today is not sustainable and that times are tough. No matter where you come from, that is something we can all agree on. It's our common thread-PEOPLE should be more important than PROFIT, but we know that is not the case when hard-working people continue to lose their homes, jobs and their lives. We need to continue taking a stand against all types of oppression, including the supression of truth.</h3>
<h3>     By teaching people practical alternatives of living and broadcasting the people's voices, we provide the tools to help people help themselves. With this campaign we have the potential to inspire thousands, if not millions, to work together, despite our differences, through that common thread.  This is one of the first steps in grassroots organizing. All we have to do is look back at our history to see the testimony of success. </h3>
<h3>      In the past year the most helpful education we received was from exposure to diverse groups of people and the causes they are passionate about. We strive to continue that process of evolving past conventional standards, breaking down stereotypes and joining the global fight to put the power back in the hands of the people.  Our work has just begun!</h3>
<h2>Other Ways To Help Our Cause</h2>
<h3>     We understand more than most that not everyone can make a monetary contribution.  However, just as important is building a network of support and informational resources.  You can help us by getting the word out about our cause, and sharing any information you think would benefit us on our tour on our facebook. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for taking the time to read our campaign. </h3>

     The majority of the funds we are asking for is going towards the purchase of an incredible bus, which will carry supplies, food and crew around the country.We need a enviromentally friendly vehicle with thea model for the lifestyle we would like to emulate and one with a cool history.  The key for this campaign being successful is being mobile.  The asking price for the bus is 22,500.  Please visit the link below for all details about the bus. You will quickly see why this is THE bus of our DREAMS!

     http://www.squeakywheeladventures.org/for_sale.php

     Any funds remaining after the purchase of the bus will be allocated to fuel, medical supplies, disaster relief/daily meals, stocking our library, art & music supplies and multi-media equipment. To ensure full transparency all spending will be documented and open sourced on our facebook page and our website.
 THE IMPACT


     The most influential thing we can offer is a chance to bring a more empowering message to people who might not otherwise hear it.  The open sharing of knowledge, experience and ideas can motivate even the most disenfranchised of individuals to come together and create feasible solutions.
     Having the ability to travel to various communities throughout the country is crucial. We are not satisfied with the disconnected means of the internet to  bring that message of love, acceptance and self-empowerment. Nothing compares to real human interaction; the intimacy of one on one conversation And hands-on education. Give us that opportunity to share ourselves as a better model for our generation. This bus is the ultimate tool for us to do this work on a large scale. 
     We know the way we live our lives today is not sustainable and that times are tough. No matter where you come from, that is something we can all agree on. It's our common thread-PEOPLE should be more important than PROFIT, but we know that is not the case when hard-working people continue to lose their homes, jobs and their lives. We need to continue taking a stand against all types of oppression, including the supression of truth.
     By teaching people practical alternatives of living and broadcasting the people's voices, we provide the tools to help people help themselves. With this campaign we have the potential to inspire thousands, if not millions, to work together, despite our differences, through that common thread.  This is one of the first steps in grassroots organizing. All we have to do is look back at our history to see the testimony of success. 
      In the past year the most helpful education we received was from exposure to diverse groups of people and the causes they are passionate about. We strive to continue that process of evolving past conventional standards, breaking down stereotypes and joining the global fight to put the power back in the hands of the people.  Our work has just begun!
Other Ways To Help Our Cause
     We understand more than most that not everyone can make a monetary contribution.  However, just as important is building a network of support and informational resources.  You can help us by getting the word out about our cause, and sharing any information you think would benefit us on our tour on our facebook. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for taking the time to read our campaign.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><img alt=""So, Who Or What Is Moon Rose Publishing?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1053.photobucket.com/albums/s461/Mirandastork/label1_zps23c8db08.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;""/></h3>
<p>Hey there. I'm Miranda Stork, the owner of Moon Rose Publishing. I've got 6 books published, and I've worked as a proofreader and editor for over 7 years, both freelance and for publishers. So I've seen the publishing industry from different sides. And most importantly--I love books, the authors behind them, and the readers that make it all worthwhile.</p>
<p>I made the decision last year to publish my own books the indie way, as I wanted to retain control. But there are hundreds of authors who sign up with small indie publishers every day. But while most of these publishers feel the way I do about books, some of them don't think about the author as much as their own deal. Cheap covers, poor editing, and even letting the author know they would be doing all the marketing. Here at Moon Rose, we want authors to feel their book wouldn't look out of place amongst one of the Big 6's books. </p>
<p>We like great covers, perfect editing, and to help the author out every step of the process. They've written a great story, the least we can do as a publisher is give it a great bow. At Moon Rose, we want a partnership between ourselves and the publisher, one that works for both of us.</p>
<p>When I started the company in October, I didn't expect a lot of interest at first. We are a new publisher, and we're floating amongst a lot of fish in our pond. But we must be doing a good job, as we currently have 15 authors signed up to Moon Rose Publishing! The problem is that it's a lot of work, and we are, at the moment, a tiny team of three people. But we want to be able to welcome more authors to our little family, and get their amazing books out there for you, the readers, to enjoy and fall in love with. And we don't just publish ebooks like a lot of new publishers, we also do it the old-fashioned way--with print books.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, that takes up funds. We've already got another ten books lined up for when submissions open again in October 2013, but we would love to have more, and really expand Moon Rose into something truly exciting. With a little of your help, we would be able to pay for all these things for each book, rather than doing it ourselves, giving us more time to find those authors and get them out there to the world;</p>
<p>Editing</p>
<p>Proofing</p>
<p>Formatting</p>
<p>Cover Design</p>
<p>Book Trailers</p>
<p>Book Tours</p>
<p>Marketing</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We don't want any of these things to be anything less than perfect. A book is a big process. Some authors takes years writing one, scrunching up pages, spending sleepless nights tapping on a keyboard, and finally plucking up the courage to put it forward to a publisher. Then it's a minimum of a eight month process just to get it ready for publication. But the end result is amazing. A book becomes a portal to escapism, a place where a reader can lose themselves for a while between the pages. Nothing compares to a book, and few things even come close.</p>
<p>So we're passionate about this campaign because we're passionate about books. We're passionate about the future of Moon Rose Publishing, and where it's going to take us. We're passionate about bringing a world of excitement to readers that will change their minds about indie books. Helping us on this campaign will shape us from a small publisher into something larger, more exciting, and more equipped to bring hundreds more authors that tiny bit closer to their dream.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3><img alt=""But What Will We Get Out Of This?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1053.photobucket.com/albums/s461/Mirandastork/label2_zps099a920b.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;""/></h3>
<p>Okay, down to brass tacks, as they say. We're putting a lot of effort into this campaign because we want to reach a big total--£3000, to be exact. But we have some big ideas for the funds.</p>
<p>Every book that comes out needs a rigious going-over before it's published. Once an author takes that big step to put a manuscript forward, it first needs reading over to check it fits into Moon Rose. Then the next step, after contracts are signed, is to get it proofed and edited. This takes a few months, with first, second, and possibly even third edits taking place to get is as close to perfect as possbile.</p>
<p>Then a trailer needs making, to let more readers know about the book, and also to let the author tell all their friends and family about their upcoming publication. An author page must be made on the website, along with links, and a lot of information.</p>
<p>The next step is to format the book, a process taking a few weeks in some cases. Each e-reader is different, so version must be made for Kindles, Nooks, Kobo readers, and Sony readers. There also needs to be a print copy formatted, usually with each page carefully pored over to make sure it all looks correct. </p>
<p>The author also needs a book tour arranging, on reviewers' blogs, the best place to find exciting new books that are coming out. This in itself takes a long time to arrange between author and blogger, with guests posts, interviews, and character interviews to write, infomation about the book and author to be sent over to the blogger, dates to be arranged, and a multitude of details specific to each blog.</p>
<p>Authors also need a Facebook page setting up, as well as a Twitter page, and any other social media they use, along with banners made by Moon Rose Publishing if they ask. </p>
<p>The final step is to design a brilliant cover. This isn't as easy as it seems! Making a cover is a lot more than slotting a few pictures together. A cover needs a lot of imagination, the ability to hook a reader in one look, and it has to fit the book. All of this must be done by a artist who carefully checks colours, photos, images, fonts, and even blurbs. Covers should be a work of art in themselves, as book <em>are </em>judged by their covers. By the way, we thought we should show a few of our covers off here, so you know where we're coming from...</p>
<p><img alt=""Our Covers!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1053.photobucket.com/albums/s461/Mirandastork/covers_zpsb88b2c88.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>All of this doesn't even cover the tiny details, such as getting and filling out the paperwork for ISBNs, stocking each book, and filling out tax forms, business forms...a lot of work in one go! And we want to do this for many authors!</p>
<p>Then comes the really hard work; letting authors know the book is out there. This is a blend of sharing on social media, blogs, selected paid adverts, reviews, sending postcards and bookmarks to bookstores, and spending time getting the book out to peopel via Street Teams and readers.</p>
<p>Your funds will help to go towards every step in this process. We already know people we trust and would love to do some work on each book, but they need to earn a living too! So these funds will allow for more books to have the same care and dedication one of our books would have. And if you're an aspiring author, it'll give us more time to accept your book onto our virtual bookshelves.</p>
<p><strong>BUT..</strong>.what do you guys get for all this? We wouldn't ask for this kind of support without offering some amazing goodies in return!</p>
<p>Your support for our funding can start at just $5, with a big thank you displayed prominently on our website, and that warm fuzzy feeling when you tell people how you've helped out the publishing industry, and a small UK-based business.</p>
<p>The goodies only get better from there, with free ebooks, graphics packages from Moon Rose Cover Designs, free print books signed by the authors themselves (so super rare!), leading up to an amazing super prize of all our goodies and the chance to star as a character in one of my books! Not just as a minor character, but as a full member of the 'book cast'. You can choose the name, how they look, their mannerisms, and much more, worked out over email with me personally.</p>
<p>Even if we don't hit our full total, we're still going to use whatever funds we raise to go towards all the tasks we've mentioned above. We want to publish at least another 20 authors in 2014, but we'll still aim to help as many as we can with the funding we raise. So every tiny total of £150 is another author who can be proud of their work, and another unique book out there for all you readers to enjoy.</p>

<h3><img alt=""How Much This Means To Us"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1053.photobucket.com/albums/s461/Mirandastork/label3_zps707daabd.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;""/></h3>
<p>Okay, time to get a little soppy. This is a business campaign, but it's also something very close to our hearts. At Moon Rose, the message is simple. We love books. We love everything about them. The authors, the readers, the wonderful escapism of reading. You can invest in many businesses, but not many businesses that open up imagination as those little paper-filled (or digital page-filled!) tomes do.</p>
<p>I personally have read books since I was three, and reading was an escape from a troubled childhood. As I grew up, books become a fountain of learning; for facts, life, and personal relationships. Books can change your outlook, how people are seen, or even the world. It sounds big and dream-like, but we all know it's true. Books can last for centuries. </p>
<p>We don't just publish any old book that comes along to our inboxes. We publish the best. We want books that are dazzling, soaked in drama and brimming with vivid characters. Moon Rose Publishing aims to help create the kind of books that are referred to by others, that are referred to in films, that give birth to quotes and characters that last long after they were born on the pages.</p>
<p>On top of this, publishing is a changing animal, shifting and twisting its way into the 21st century. With e-books, reading has become easier and more accessible for us all. Storytellers who would normally have to wait years to even get a sniff at being published can now create their vision for anyone to read. We love this idea, but we also love paperbacks in our hands. So unlike a lot of indie publishers, we've decided to make print books of all our suitable books, allowing for the wonderful feeling of a book in your hands.</p>
<p>We want just one thing, and I know we've mentioned it a lot. We don't want to let our authors or their readers down. We don't want to become one of the publishers that had to remain small because we didn't have the funds to do otherwise. We want to be bigger, because we believe we're doing something right, and we want to be there when the next big thing comes along in the publishing industry...like reading from a hologram chip in your head! Maybe not, but we'll keep our eyes peeled.</p>

</div></div>","Hey there. I'm Miranda Stork, the owner of Moon Rose Publishing. I've got 6 books published, and I've worked as a proofreader and editor for over 7 years, both freelance and for publishers. So I've seen the publishing industry from different sides. And most importantly--I love books, the authors behind them, and the readers that make it all worthwhile.
I made the decision last year to publish my own books the indie way, as I wanted to retain control. But there are hundreds of authors who sign up with small indie publishers every day. But while most of these publishers feel the way I do about books, some of them don't think about the author as much as their own deal. Cheap covers, poor editing, and even letting the author know they would be doing all the marketing. Here at Moon Rose, we want authors to feel their book wouldn't look out of place amongst one of the Big 6's books. 
We like great covers, perfect editing, and to help the author out every step of the process. They've written a great story, the least we can do as a publisher is give it a great bow. At Moon Rose, we want a partnership between ourselves and the publisher, one that works for both of us.
When I started the company in October, I didn't expect a lot of interest at first. We are a new publisher, and we're floating amongst a lot of fish in our pond. But we must be doing a good job, as we currently have 15 authors signed up to Moon Rose Publishing! The problem is that it's a lot of work, and we are, at the moment, a tiny team of three people. But we want to be able to welcome more authors to our little family, and get their amazing books out there for you, the readers, to enjoy and fall in love with. And we don't just publish ebooks like a lot of new publishers, we also do it the old-fashioned way--with print books.
But unfortunately, that takes up funds. We've already got another ten books lined up for when submissions open again in October 2013, but we would love to have more, and really expand Moon Rose into something truly exciting. With a little of your help, we would be able to pay for all these things for each book, rather than doing it ourselves, giving us more time to find those authors and get them out there to the world;
Editing
Proofing
Formatting
Cover Design
Book Trailers
Book Tours
Marketing
 
We don't want any of these things to be anything less than perfect. A book is a big process. Some authors takes years writing one, scrunching up pages, spending sleepless nights tapping on a keyboard, and finally plucking up the courage to put it forward to a publisher. Then it's a minimum of a eight month process just to get it ready for publication. But the end result is amazing. A book becomes a portal to escapism, a place where a reader can lose themselves for a while between the pages. Nothing compares to a book, and few things even come close.
So we're passionate about this campaign because we're passionate about books. We're passionate about the future of Moon Rose Publishing, and where it's going to take us. We're passionate about bringing a world of excitement to readers that will change their minds about indie books. Helping us on this campaign will shape us from a small publisher into something larger, more exciting, and more equipped to bring hundreds more authors that tiny bit closer to their dream.
 



Okay, down to brass tacks, as they say. We're putting a lot of effort into this campaign because we want to reach a big total--£3000, to be exact. But we have some big ideas for the funds.
Every book that comes out needs a rigious going-over before it's published. Once an author takes that big step to put a manuscript forward, it first needs reading over to check it fits into Moon Rose. Then the next step, after contracts are signed, is to get it proofed and edited. This takes a few months, with first, second, and possibly even third edits taking place to get is as close to perfect as possbile.
Then a trailer needs making, to let more readers know about the book, and also to let the author tell all their friends and family about their upcoming publication. An author page must be made on the website, along with links, and a lot of information.
The next step is to format the book, a process taking a few weeks in some cases. Each e-reader is different, so version must be made for Kindles, Nooks, Kobo readers, and Sony readers. There also needs to be a print copy formatted, usually with each page carefully pored over to make sure it all looks correct. 
The author also needs a book tour arranging, on reviewers' blogs, the best place to find exciting new books that are coming out. This in itself takes a long time to arrange between author and blogger, with guests posts, interviews, and character interviews to write, infomation about the book and author to be sent over to the blogger, dates to be arranged, and a multitude of details specific to each blog.
Authors also need a Facebook page setting up, as well as a Twitter page, and any other social media they use, along with banners made by Moon Rose Publishing if they ask. 
The final step is to design a brilliant cover. This isn't as easy as it seems! Making a cover is a lot more than slotting a few pictures together. A cover needs a lot of imagination, the ability to hook a reader in one look, and it has to fit the book. All of this must be done by a artist who carefully checks colours, photos, images, fonts, and even blurbs. Covers should be a work of art in themselves, as book are judged by their covers. By the way, we thought we should show a few of our covers off here, so you know where we're coming from...

All of this doesn't even cover the tiny details, such as getting and filling out the paperwork for ISBNs, stocking each book, and filling out tax forms, business forms...a lot of work in one go! And we want to do this for many authors!
Then comes the really hard work; letting authors know the book is out there. This is a blend of sharing on social media, blogs, selected paid adverts, reviews, sending postcards and bookmarks to bookstores, and spending time getting the book out to peopel via Street Teams and readers.
Your funds will help to go towards every step in this process. We already know people we trust and would love to do some work on each book, but they need to earn a living too! So these funds will allow for more books to have the same care and dedication one of our books would have. And if you're an aspiring author, it'll give us more time to accept your book onto our virtual bookshelves.
BUT...what do you guys get for all this? We wouldn't ask for this kind of support without offering some amazing goodies in return!
Your support for our funding can start at just $5, with a big thank you displayed prominently on our website, and that warm fuzzy feeling when you tell people how you've helped out the publishing industry, and a small UK-based business.
The goodies only get better from there, with free ebooks, graphics packages from Moon Rose Cover Designs, free print books signed by the authors themselves (so super rare!), leading up to an amazing super prize of all our goodies and the chance to star as a character in one of my books! Not just as a minor character, but as a full member of the 'book cast'. You can choose the name, how they look, their mannerisms, and much more, worked out over email with me personally.
Even if we don't hit our full total, we're still going to use whatever funds we raise to go towards all the tasks we've mentioned above. We want to publish at least another 20 authors in 2014, but we'll still aim to help as many as we can with the funding we raise. So every tiny total of £150 is another author who can be proud of their work, and another unique book out there for all you readers to enjoy.
 



Okay, time to get a little soppy. This is a business campaign, but it's also something very close to our hearts. At Moon Rose, the message is simple. We love books. We love everything about them. The authors, the readers, the wonderful escapism of reading. You can invest in many businesses, but not many businesses that open up imagination as those little paper-filled (or digital page-filled!) tomes do.
I personally have read books since I was three, and reading was an escape from a troubled childhood. As I grew up, books become a fountain of learning; for facts, life, and personal relationships. Books can change your outlook, how people are seen, or even the world. It sounds big and dream-like, but we all know it's true. Books can last for centuries. 
We don't just publish any old book that comes along to our inboxes. We publish the best. We want books that are dazzling, soaked in drama and brimming with vivid characters. Moon Rose Publishing aims to help create the kind of books that are referred to by others, that are referred to in films, that give birth to quotes and characters that last long after they were born on the pages.
On top of this, publishing is a changing animal, shifting and twisting its way into the 21st century. With e-books, reading has become easier and more accessible for us all. Storytellers who would normally have to wait years to even get a sniff at being published can now create their vision for anyone to read. We love this idea, but we also love paperbacks in our hands. So unlike a lot of indie publishers, we've decided to make print books of all our suitable books, allowing for the wonderful feeling of a book in your hands.
We want just one thing, and I know we've mentioned it a lot. We don't want to let our authors or their readers down. We don't want to become one of the publishers that had to remain small because we didn't have the funds to do otherwise. We want to be bigger, because we believe we're doing something right, and we want to be there when the next big thing comes along in the publishing industry...like reading from a hologram chip in your head! Maybe not, but we'll keep our eyes peeled.
