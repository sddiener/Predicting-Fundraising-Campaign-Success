<p><strong>Who doesn’t love to be taken care of? Who doesn’t dream to play all day long, to concentrate on achieving immediate pleasures without suffering the consequences of her irresponsibility? As we grow up, we exchange our playfulness for role play, acting and gender play, tasks that require a persistent oppression of our inner child. Whether boys or girls, children love to swim naked, can be satisfied with simple things and sometimes are afraid of the dark. Children are selfish without being apologetic about it. This changes as we become adults. Especially, in the case of females, since women are measured in society by their abilities to care for others, for their self-sacrifice, for their capabilities as mothers. Even in modern society, women are designed to serve (to serve children, to serve men). They hardly have the privilege to enjoy their own bodies, since male dominated society makes us believe that our own pleasure resides in comforting others. </strong></p>
<p><strong>My name is Rinat Schnadower, a selfish, playful, hedonistic, un-nurturing female</strong><strong> photographer and performance artist, and for the last 2 years, I have been dealing with the question</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> WHY?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>                           </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What is “Play” all about?</strong></p>
<p>My upcoming exhibition, “Play”, is a result of this intensive process. A series of works that deal mainly with the female body – with my own body –, since there is nothing like self-portraiture to deconstruct myself into parent and child, dominator and dominated (photographer and model) and engage in a dual role play where I play both parts.</p>
<p>As you must have already guessed, I’m very excited about it. This first solo show is for me an opportunity to contribute to the world my unique point of view about playfulness, role play and gender, and to introduce my style that is flashy and surreal, daring and surprising and in many cases, provocative, as some critics say. I must admit I take it as a compliment: provoking people to feel or to think nowadays, isn’t an easy task.</p>

<h2>NOTICE</h2>
<p><u>OUR GOAL AMOUNT HAS BEEN REDUCED TO US$6,000/S$8,000!</u></p>
<h3>About the Affair</h3>
<p><u>Part symposium, part art festival — otherwise, a gathering — <i>A Weekend Affair</i> is set to occur in June, 2019</u>. The year marks the 200th year of Singapore’s marriage to her colonial legacies, which have manifested in myriad ways, from the pristinely-kept barracks turned art gallery clusters, to socio-militarised policymaking and the “Raffles-Singapore” brand. Taking on the theme of ‘an affair’, what we seek is a deviation from this union through, on one hand, a reinvestigation of our sociopolitical history, and on the other, a regeneration of theory on how we might (re)negotiate our relationship with coloniality&amp;/capitalism  — away from the infamous “divide and rule” — and into a shared future.</p>
<p>It is therefore vital to recognise the need to go beyond this relationship with coloniality; to see that it extends to unravel the threads of relation that weave the complex contemporary condition of capitalism, characterised by exhaustions, depression, alienation, and the sense of perpetual crises and precariousness. Hence, the question is then one of departure: <u>how do we begin to disentangle from a relationship 200 years in the making, and how do we reinvent or forge a new relationship through a different form of currency or exchange?</u> How do we care for one another in this condition? If an uprising is unimaginable, how does one be covert?</p>
<p>As an independent initiative,<i> A Weekend Affair</i> is also, in some ways, a purposeful deviation from practised methods of finding funding in the arts, and an exercise in alternative fundraising. We fully acknowledge that what we are trying to do here is ambitious to say the least, and is an undertaking that requires the activation of an entire network of accomplices, alliances, and affinities. Through this Indiegogo campaign, we humbly ask for you to take a leap of faith with us, and lend your support that will be vital in helping us to realize the Weekend in June 2019. </p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>As <i>A Weekend Affair </i>is an initiative for the arts community and the public at large, it has no employable team members but comprises of some committed yet fluid and amazing people who are contributing in various ways, each of their own capacities; Wong Bing Hao, Shona Findlay, Mike H.J. Chang, Godwin Koay, and a few others! While the initiative is generally co-led by art practitioners Wayne Lim and Soh Kay Min, our design and visual identity is spearheaded by Pixie Tan, and we have Seet Yun Teng, our lovely volunteer.</p>
<h3>The Weekend</h3>

<h3>Intent</h3>
<p>Without too much oversimplification, the purpose of<i> A Weekend Affair</i> is more than just providing a platform for ideas to brew; it also aims to spur discussion through interdisciplinary (art) practices. Through our thematics (mentioned above) and our Weekend program (consisting of the open call and collateral events), we are asking for a genuine get-together, a safe — albeit temporary — space to turn affinities into action(s); connection(s) into care; to discuss about difficult things, but also to speak simply, and be unrestrained. We are asking you to seek to deviate, but not to disacknowledge; to refuse but not to rebel. </p>
<p>All in all, <i>A Weekend Affair</i> suggests lush intimacy, passion, and care, but at the same time, it is also covert, and perhaps (most importantly) fugitive and unregulated.

<h3>Where is the money going?</h3>
<p><i>A Weekend Affair </i>works within strict principles and grounds with regards to its conceptual framework. Committing to the hope of a genuinely shared future — one against popular narratives and nationalist strategies — <u>we remain steadfast in our commitment to <i>A Weekend Affair</i> as a bottom-up and non-profit initiative</u>. Our team has donated their time and labour (and money) in planning and organising this event, not to mention the input of many other contributors, mentors, and friends.</p>
<p>At the same time, we firmly believe in paid creative labour and its importance in sustaining a healthy art community not reliant on exploitation and precarious labour conditions. Your money would firstly go into <strong>providing a small fee </strong>to all presenters during the Weekend. Secondly, it will fund the <strong>event operational costs </strong>for the Weekend itself (June 2019), including venue costs, logistics, and food.</p>
<p>In addition to the Weekend, there will be <u>three</u> lead-up events,<strong> Rendezvous I, II and III</strong>. The first Rendezvous will see the launch of this crowdfunding campaign at Telok Ayer Arts Club, the second being a collaboration with Bras Basah Open: School of Theory and Philosophy (BBO) in the form of the collective’s signature TheoryFILM format at The Substation on March 31, 2019 (click <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/377119809808106/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to see our Facebook event page and <a href=""https://awkndaffr-rendezvous-ii.peatix.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to get your tickets)! </p>
<p>*Details regarding the third rendezvous will be announced in time. It should tentatively be a week before The Weekend, on May 25, 2019.*</p>
<p>We are working towards putting together <strong>a mini-publication</strong>, <i>Unfaithful to the System, </i>that runs along the thematics of <i>A Weekend Affair</i>, and will address the complex condition of contemporary colonial-capitalism that we seek to disentangle from. However, due to overwhelming work involving the planning or A Weekend Affair, we have decided to make publication a post-Affair matter. Please do not feel discouraged from claiming this perk, because we are reworking our publication timeline at the moment, and still aiming to publish it by the end of this year!</p>
<p><u>Here is the breakdown of estimated operational costs for <i>A Weekend Affair:</i></u></p>
<p><strong>Note: We have cut down significantly (between 50-70%) on our budget/operational costs to reflect the bare necessities of what’s needed for A Weekend Affair to go on.</strong> Budget costs for the Publication will be moved to future funding after the Weekend – however, we’re still accepting Indiegogo perk claims for the Publication, which will be produced in the near future.</p>

OUR GOAL AMOUNT HAS BEEN REDUCED TO US$6,000/S$8,000!
About the Affair
Part symposium, part art festival — otherwise, a gathering — A Weekend Affair is set to occur in June, 2019. The year marks the 200th year of Singapore’s marriage to her colonial legacies, which have manifested in myriad ways, from the pristinely-kept barracks turned art gallery clusters, to socio-militarised policymaking and the “Raffles-Singapore” brand. Taking on the theme of ‘an affair’, what we seek is a deviation from this union through, on one hand, a reinvestigation of our sociopolitical history, and on the other, a regeneration of theory on how we might (re)negotiate our relationship with coloniality&/capitalism  — away from the infamous “divide and rule” — and into a shared future.
It is therefore vital to recognise the need to go beyond this relationship with coloniality; to see that it extends to unravel the threads of relation that weave the complex contemporary condition of capitalism, characterised by exhaustions, depression, alienation, and the sense of perpetual crises and precariousness. Hence, the question is then one of departure: how do we begin to disentangle from a relationship 200 years in the making, and how do we reinvent or forge a new relationship through a different form of currency or exchange? How do we care for one another in this condition? If an uprising is unimaginable, how does one be covert?
As an independent initiative, A Weekend Affair is also, in some ways, a purposeful deviation from practised methods of finding funding in the arts, and an exercise in alternative fundraising. We fully acknowledge that what we are trying to do here is ambitious to say the least, and is an undertaking that requires the activation of an entire network of accomplices, alliances, and affinities. Through this Indiegogo campaign, we humbly ask for you to take a leap of faith with us, and lend your support that will be vital in helping us to realize the Weekend in June 2019. 

About Us
As A Weekend Affair is an initiative for the arts community and the public at large, it has no employable team members but comprises of some committed yet fluid and amazing people who are contributing in various ways, each of their own capacities; Wong Bing Hao, Shona Findlay, Mike H.J. Chang, Godwin Koay, and a few others! While the initiative is generally co-led by art practitioners Wayne Lim and Soh Kay Min, our design and visual identity is spearheaded by Pixie Tan, and we have Seet Yun Teng, our lovely volunteer.
The Weekend
Meant to be more than just an intimate gathering of peoples and communities, and drawing from the signature events of art and academia — the festival and the symposium — A Weekend Affair aims to bring about a sharing of knowledge through theory and different forms of (art) practice, and turning ideas into reality through practice. The ‘presentations’ will happen on June 1-2, 2019, at a chalet located at the historically loaded Changi-Loyang part of Singapore. 
Aside from the programme line-up that will come out of proposals received from the open call, parallel collateral projects with long-term collaborators of The Affair will also happen concurrently during the weekend itself. There will be time for lunches and breaks in between; discussion sessions will happen at the end, after dinner time on both days. Definitely, lots of hanging out! 
As aforementioned, A Weekend Affair is essentially a gathering, a space to unwind; for (self-)care, love and intimacy. Come with friends; get soaked in (art) theory, get a massage, walk on the beach, read or, for the BBQ — that is up to you! 
We are pleased to announce the results of our open call, which will be part of Main Program of The Weekend! A Weekend Affair presents: Zhiyi Cao, Kevin Chua, Stephanie Dogfoot, Vimal Kumar, Loo Zihan, Jaxton Su & Chen Jiexiao, Berny Tan and Johann Yamin. Hailing from Tokyo, New York, and Bangkok, we have Hibiki Mizuno, Amelyn Ng and Pitchaya Ngamcharoen.

Intent
Without too much oversimplification, the purpose of A Weekend Affair is more than just providing a platform for ideas to brew; it also aims to spur discussion through interdisciplinary (art) practices. Through our thematics (mentioned above) and our Weekend program (consisting of the open call and collateral events), we are asking for a genuine get-together, a safe — albeit temporary — space to turn affinities into action(s); connection(s) into care; to discuss about difficult things, but also to speak simply, and be unrestrained. We are asking you to seek to deviate, but not to disacknowledge; to refuse but not to rebel. 
All in all, A Weekend Affair suggests lush intimacy, passion, and care, but at the same time, it is also covert, and perhaps (most importantly) fugitive and unregulated. To find out more about the theoretical interests behind A Weekend Affair, please click here: https://aweekendaffair.info/About

<p>Nopal was founded by two Indianapolis culturists whose common goal is to promote the music and art scene in a way which would bring crowds of diverse people together. We have been around for almost two years now and have organized many events which did just that.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This fall we are organizing our second annual Day De Los Muertos event, our take on Dia de Muertos (Day of the Dead) which brings together many creative movers and shakers in Indy's community. The result is an enchanting community event which meshes tradition with contemporary takes from all our contributors.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This event is highly important to us because it involves many volunteers from different racial backgrounds. Co-founder Daniel Del Real has stated ""When we bring the best of each of our cultures together, we create something unique and beautiful."" This is exactly what we are aiming to do and need your help to achieve.</p>
<p>The contributions from this campaign will help us create an event which will honor both the tradition of Day of the Dead and how we as a diverse and contemporary society are making it our own today. To be able to express that to the community is highly valuable because it creates a stronger appreciation for creativity and culture.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Day De Los Muertos<br/>
</h3>
</div><div> <p><i>Why Day De Los Muertos? Why not Day of the Dead or Dia de los Muertos?</i></p>
<p>Because we want to create an environment which allows both Latino and Non-Latino individuals to feel like they are welcome and can appreciate this event. Our events are always Spanglish oriented. They say there's two sides to every story, we want to show you both the traditional story and the contemporary interpretation, we will do that by telling it to you in a way which is universally understood through English and Spanish language programming.<b><br/></b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>
<b>What we need to tell that story</b><br/>
</h3>
</div><div>When we decided to host our own Day of the Dead celebration last year, we tossed around a lot of ideas to incorporate both traditional, transitional, and contemporary aspects of this holiday. With limited funding we were forced to choose only a few which we felt best told the story. <br/><br/><b>This time we want to implement more ideas and tell a larger story.</b><br/><br/>We need funding to cover the costs associated with the three week long exhibition and celebration day. Although we have many volunteers to help build and put together the exhibition, we need funds to cover the costs of supplies. Here's what we need:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Lumber, hardware, paint, and objects to construct the altar structures</li>
<li>Colored paper, tissue paper, and miscellaneous art supplies</li>
<li>Traditional costumes for our Catrinas and Catrines to wear</li>
<li>Makeup, hair spray and other beauty products for the Catrinas, and Catrines</li>
<li>Fabrics, accessories, and supplies to create items which cannot be sourced</li>
<li>Funds to cover the costs to print our posters, flyers and programs. We need to get the word out!</li>
<li>Lights, stands, and speakers which we will use on the day of our celebration</li>
<li>Photography and videography to document our event<br/>
</li>
<li>Because we believe in supporting our artists, we would like to provide stipends to all the creative individuals involved with building altars, designing hairdos, makeup, and performers.</li>

</div></div>","Nopal Cultural Center
Nopal was founded by two Indianapolis culturists whose common goal is to promote the music and art scene in a way which would bring crowds of diverse people together. We have been around for almost two years now and have organized many events which did just that.


This fall we are organizing our second annual Day De Los Muertos event, our take on Dia de Muertos (Day of the Dead) which brings together many creative movers and shakers in Indy's community. The result is an enchanting community event which meshes tradition with contemporary takes from all our contributors.


This event is highly important to us because it involves many volunteers from different racial backgrounds. Co-founder Daniel Del Real has stated ""When we bring the best of each of our cultures together, we create something unique and beautiful."" This is exactly what we are aiming to do and need your help to achieve.
The contributions from this campaign will help us create an event which will honor both the tradition of Day of the Dead and how we as a diverse and contemporary society are making it our own today. To be able to express that to the community is highly valuable because it creates a stronger appreciation for creativity and culture.

Day De Los Muertos

 Why Day De Los Muertos? Why not Day of the Dead or Dia de los Muertos?
Because we want to create an environment which allows both Latino and Non-Latino individuals to feel like they are welcome and can appreciate this event. Our events are always Spanglish oriented. They say there's two sides to every story, we want to show you both the traditional story and the contemporary interpretation, we will do that by telling it to you in a way which is universally understood through English and Spanish language programming.


What we need to tell that story

When we decided to host our own Day of the Dead celebration last year, we tossed around a lot of ideas to incorporate both traditional, transitional, and contemporary aspects of this holiday. With limited funding we were forced to choose only a few which we felt best told the story. This time we want to implement more ideas and tell a larger story.We need funding to cover the costs associated with the three week long exhibition and celebration day. Although we have many volunteers to help build and put together the exhibition, we need funds to cover the costs of supplies. Here's what we need:
Lumber, hardware, paint, and objects to construct the altar structures
Colored paper, tissue paper, and miscellaneous art supplies
Traditional costumes for our Catrinas and Catrines to wear
Makeup, hair spray and other beauty products for the Catrinas, and Catrines
Fabrics, accessories, and supplies to create items which cannot be sourced
Funds to cover the costs to print our posters, flyers and programs. We need to get the word out!
Lights, stands, and speakers which we will use on the day of our celebration
Photography and videography to document our event

Because we believe in supporting our artists, we would like to provide stipends to all the creative individuals involved with building altars, designing hairdos, makeup, and performers.

Our company is all about viewing people for what they are capable of, naturally and joyfully, and then joining our possABILITIES together to great a stronger community.WHY US, WHY ME, & WHY NOW?I am a father of a 22 year-old son with disabilities, so I intimately know the need for more creative career solutions that lead to independence for adults with disabilities. Integration into the community and work training programs for adults with disabilities have come a long way in my lifetime, but I think we can do better. I believe we are on the verge of a disruption in the public’ paradigm of how much people with disabilities can contribute to the goodness of our world. The current rate of full-time employment for people with disabilities nationally is around 33%, so this population needs innovative ideas, and investment.My professional career spans three decades starting in advertising graphic design, package and retail design, and into product development. In this capacity, I worked with dozens of clients in the Fortune 500 and top 100 CPG’s in the United States to create effective packaging, point of sale solutions, and products.I want to use my experience and talents to go beyond helping corporations, to help some very special people discover, and find success in their creative abilities. My combined graphic design, marketing, sales and business leadership skill set and experiences have prepared me to lead this project.We know that there are thousands more artists out there in the world just like my son who could be gaining independence and making a living from their creative abilities and talents. These are the people we want to find and help with IntoWishin’ Arts.OUR GOAL & OUR NEEDSWe are attempting to raise $36,000. When you help us get to our funding goal, as a founding member of IntoWishin' Arts your contribution will help fund the following six expenses:1.) Outreach communication to adults with disabilities, and the nonprofit organizations who serve them, so we can inform more of them about us, our workshop, and product selling opportunities.2.) Art workshops for adults with disabilities to create art and design.3.) Art supplies for our workshops4.) Paying dedicated staff, art teachers and mentors to facilitate IntoWishin’ Arts workshops.5.) Expenses associated with building our very first e-commerce t-shirt and apparel store where all of the designs will be inspired and created by adults with disabilities.6.) Legal and accounting fees associated with creating art, copyright law, and protecting trademarks on behalf of our artists.OUR COMPANY & GIVING CULTUREWe are a for-profit e-commerce business with a social mission to help artists with disabilities earn an income from their art and gain greater financial independence. We will pay artists above-industry royalties for each product sold, and artists will maintain their original copyright. Our mission also includes partnerships with nonprofits that already serve adults with disabilities. IntoWishin' Arts will also donate 10% of annual profits above and beyond royalties paid to artists with disabilities to our non-profit partners to create even more art creation activities. We intend to earn B-Corp status to provide the community important transparency about our business practices.  OUR GROWTH PLANSThe plans are to crowd-fund to launch more creative workshops over the first six months of 2018. We’ll prove the concept in our local market of Appleton and Green Bay, Wisconsin to work out the bugs and bring the concept to other US marketsWAYS YOU CAN HELPWe will be launching via IndieGogo, so we need interested parties to invest in our start-up, share our campaign, and help us spread awareness of our existence to investors, nonprofits servicing the disabled population, arts educators, and disabled adults around the entire US.Please SHARE this campaign directly by email, social media, blogs, and IndieGogo’s sharing tools.Our SUCCESS depends on YOU!Thank you!*NOTE: All Thank You Package shipments, including  charitableGift Certificate Packages will become available in January 2018. After a donation is made, we will contact you to confirm your product preferences, colors, sizes, etc. Confirmation emails will be sent to keep you informed of our progress and anticipated delivery dates.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am an artist, independent researcher, and educator in textiles, with a focus on embroidery and net-making.  For the past 5 years I have been traveling to study embroidery and learn techniques. I have learned Hungarian written embroidery in Transylvania, Romania, net-making and cross-stitch for mittens in Iceland, and counted cross-stitch for shirts in Oaxaca, Mexico. From 2012 - 14 I designed and manufactured products with women in Transylvania and now teach workshops in these disappearing crafts.  </p>
<p>What sets my craft workshops apart:  I focus on the people keeping traditions alive, their stories, the history and symbolism of their craft, as well as learning how to make a stitch or tie a knot.  My goal is for students to learn a skill, appreciate the culture, and feel a connection with Piroska in Romania or Maria in Mexico by seeing their work and hearing a bit about their lives.  </p>
<p>Your contribution will help me meet and learn from lace-makers, stitchers, and textile professionals in The Netherlands and Ukraine so that I can share their work and stories! </p>
<p>There is so much love in handcraft, whether it warms your hands, decorates the kitchen, or commemorates a birth or death.  I want to honor the women and men who are keeping traditions alive and together, with my workshop participants, create a global community of makers united by cultural heritage skills.</p>
<p>I have taught workshops in the San Francisco Bay Area including the Handcraft Studio School and lectured for the Embroiderers' Guild of America.  My fine art work has been exhibited in the US and Europe.  I hold a BA from Scripps College, Claremont and an MFA in Visual Arts from Mason Gross School of the Arts, Rutgers University.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your contribution will fund:</h3>
<p>Airfare from San Francisco to Amsterdam and Amsterdam to Kiev and back.  </p>
<p>OBRAS artist's residency fee (apartment AND studio space for a lot less then a month's rent in the SF Bay Area!). OBRAS is located in Renkum, a city of 30,000 people on the Rhine River, a couple hours from Amsterdam by train.</p>
<p>Train and bus travel, budget accommodations for 3 overnight trips within the Netherlands and several day trips including Amsterdam, Tilburg, Einkhuizen, Haarlem, Rotterdam/ South Holland.  </p>
<p>Hostel stay in Kiev and travel/lodging in rural Western Ukraine for 4 days.  Will hire a translator.</p>
<p>Art Supplies: fabric (new and second-hand), thread, yarn, brass wire, brass plates, embroidery floss, thread, paper. (Before the residency I'm taking lessons with an Oakland, CA jewelry artist to make 'oorijzer', the decorative metal piece that was part of the traditional folk headdress until the 1800s. The metalwork will provide a skeleton for my sculpture.)</p>
<p>Lessons with an artisan in Renkum or Spakenburg: crochet for lace caps from Spakenburg or other traditional techniques.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have been awarded and successfully completed international artist's residencies in Budapest, Hungary, Blonduos, Iceland, and Oaxaca, Mexico.  I am confident that I will be to take full advantage of my residency in the Netherlands, making artwork, learning new skills, and documenting my research on Dutch textiles.  Please take a look at my Instagram account <a href=""http://www.instagram/threadwritten"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@threadwritten</a>!  Scroll back for images from Mexico, Iceland, and my handful of trips to Transylvania, Romania.</p>
<p>Your contribution will fund lessons with artisans in the Netherlands and Ukraine, documentation of disappearing textile practices, and skill-building for new workshops I'll offer in the US!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Travel is always an adventure with many unknowns!  Using the residency as a source of support and introduction to the local culture, it provides a stable and comfortable home base and entry into the community.  Sometimes projects shift or a new discovery changes the direction of my work, however I don't see any challenges getting in the way of having a rich experience with much to share when I return.</p>

<p>My name is Jessica Gokey. I live on the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation in Hayward Wisconsin. I have been beading for over ten years and have currents works of beadwork art in local art galleries and have been commissioned to make pieces of beadwork for people. I work on my beadwork fulltime to keep the tradition alive and help sustain my family. My plan is to bring community members together to teach the importance of Native Traditions and to keep the art of traditional beadwork alive. I have experience with teaching tribal traditions and treaty rights to youth and community members though my past job and Conservation Warden. But with changes in my life and my choice to be a stay at home mother, I have worked on my beadwork fulltime now to be at home to raise my son. But the love of beadwork, traditions, and teaching is part of my life that I want to continue to share with my community members.</p>
<p>Keeping tradition alive is something important in my life as an Ojibwe Native American. One tradition that has become a huge part of my life is beadwork. I have been beading for over ten years. I learned how to bead while watching my aunt bead just like her elder before her taught her. Through my beadwork I keep our traditions alive using traditional Ojibwe patterns and learning history and importance of beadwork to our people.</p>
<p>What’s the plan? Well my plan is to bring together our youth or inexperienced people in the community with more experienced beaders such as myself. I will teach the inexperienced people how to bead, why it’s so important to keep this tradition alive, and how to make traditional patterns of our Ojibwe people.</p>
<p>Am I just going to teach how to bead? Yes and No. I will be teaching students how to bead but also how to make item to bead on such as: moccasins, pipe bags, tobacco pouches, belts, medallions, and other items students show interest on how to make and apply beadwork to.</p>
<p>Although it would be nice to get up right now to do this now, the lack of supplies holds me back. My plan is to raise $5,000 for supplies to teach my students, handouts and teaching materials, and compensation to fellow teachers for their time.</p>
<p>With the start-up of this collective beading program curriculum, I am hoping with the successful funds raised and student turn-out the long term goal is to be able to sustain this program with community involvement and tribal school/college/enterprises support.</p>
<p>The challenge this project may face is lack of support for future long-term sustainment. But how can I overcome this? With the self determination to get support from the tribal school/college/enterprises support, my plan is to have a solid program already established and a curriculum made to show tribal school/college/enterprises that this project is a great investment to support and for to help keep our native traditions alive for our future generations to come.</p>
<p>With generous donations, donors will recieve hand made native american items made by myself, Jessica Gokey to show appreciation to help preserve native traditions. All items are made by hand and are one of a kind, no item is duplicated with same designs or beadwork. You can own a piece of native american tradition with your generous donation.</p>

</div></div>","My name is Jessica Gokey. I live on the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation in Hayward Wisconsin. I have been beading for over ten years and have currents works of beadwork art in local art galleries and have been commissioned to make pieces of beadwork for people. I work on my beadwork fulltime to keep the tradition alive and help sustain my family. My plan is to bring community members together to teach the importance of Native Traditions and to keep the art of traditional beadwork alive. I have experience with teaching tribal traditions and treaty rights to youth and community members though my past job and Conservation Warden. But with changes in my life and my choice to be a stay at home mother, I have worked on my beadwork fulltime now to be at home to raise my son.

<p><strong>**This is our last week, and a grand opening is no longer possible.  We had to repair more then we expected**</strong></p>
<p>We own Skin Alternative, an upscale tattoo studio.  Troy is the artist/owner with over 14 years experience. Kate is the accountant/shop manager/marketing designer, etc. We also have an employee, Joseph Bawden who has 3 years experience and is growing both professionally and talent wise every day.  We are family oriented and based on creating personal connections and a professional experience.  We have been in business for 4 years. We had our studio in Hillside, NJ and due to a dispute with our landlord it was in our family's best interest to close down and vacate the property.</p>
<p>We are now setting up our studio in the town of Scotch Plains,NJ. Getting our shop set up in Scotch Plains is going to be the turning point for our business, and our family.  Where we were fighting a deteriorating building and area, we will now be in a legitimate location with higher traffic and more customers. </p>
<p>We are the first, and only allowed tattoo studio in Scotch Plains and we believe we are a great studio for the town. We are above the bar with talent and individual attention. We treat our customers like family. Since we are the first and only, we had to go before a zoning board to get special approval.  We faced the following costs.</p>
<p>$2,000 Lawyer, $3,000 Planner, $1,800 Zoning fees</p>
<p>We had some money saved up from when our business was open, but it was not nearly enough to cover these costs and pay the bills at our house and cover construction to open the new studio.</p>
<p>This is where we need your help.  Construction is costing us $5,000-$6,000 and we do not have the money available to cover that AND setup and have a grand opening.  A grand opening is important to us to let the town know what we are all about and to provide our own merchandise to give out.  We want to reassure them that they made a good decision allowing us to be in their town. We are not your typical ""tattoo shop"" and we want to world to know it.</p>
<p>We are offering perk packages ranging from $2 which gets you a high quality vinyl weather-resistant sticker and a personally hand-written thank you note from Kate and the girls, to $400 for a gift card valued at $500 plus the sticker and thank you. Packages include body jewelry, clothing, and various merchandise.</p>
<p><strong>If we do not reach our goal, we are still going to open the Scotch Plains Studio, but funding would be very tight for ourselves and our home.</strong></p>
<p>We truly feel that setting up our studio in Scotch Plains would give the residents of the town a chance to get their tattoos local and invest their money back into their community.  We always have donated to the local police, fire and school fundraisers.  We are looking into setting up space for local artists to show off some of their artwork through a ""local artist of the month"" program.  And we will also be showcasing some additional artwork from artists we know.</p>
<p>If we are blessed enough to raise more then we are asking, then any additional money will go towards giving back whether it be through sponsorships or local events.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you can't donate, please spread the word. Every little bit helps.</p>

<h3>THE WAY OF THE WHITE SAND</h3>
<p>Hello Friends </p>
<p>My name is Louis Schwadron and after a decade of writing, recording and touring internationally with bands, artists and musicians of all walks, I now front a 5-piece dreamrock band called SKY WHITE TIGER here in New York City.</p>
<p>We are raising money for a once-in-a-lifetime concert experience and live audio/video recording in a Brooklyn Cathedral this October called THE WAY OF THE WHITE SAND. Audiences are invited to lie on a sea of white fur and experience the expanded live ""surround sound"" of 5-piece band, choir, strings, gamelan ensemble performing a seamless concept album from various areas of the cathedral -surrounding the audience. This will be the very first of a series of these live concert experiences we will develop with visual artists and projectionisits in large scale spaces all over the world with this material.</p>
<p>THE WAY OF THE WHITE SAND doubles as the name of the upcoming live album and an original fantasy story I've written to accompany the album. Benton C Bainbridge (Beastie Boys, TV on the Radio, Whitney, MOMA, EMPAC) will shoot and edit original content then work with members of Light Harvest Studio to interpret the story in original light art and video projections on various moons and surfaces around the cathedral.  <br/><br/>We have been invited by the Bobby Redd Project space to put on this show Oct 6th. In order to do this we need to think like theater producers rather than  performers of this music.  While the space is bold and beautiful - it is up to us to bring in everything but the cathedral itself.</p>
<p><em>Your contributions make it possible to pay</em> <em>all of the performers, live audio engineers, lighting designer, video projectionists, content development with Benton Bainbridge for the projections, light and projector rentals, audio rental gear for live sound and multitracked recording, white (faux) fur carpeting, large scale spherical screens + riggers, live camera crew , video editors, liquor, bartenders, programs</em>, <em>pretty much everything you will experience OCT 6th and the costs to capture, edit and repackage the experience in audio and video formats once its through - as a thank you to all of you!</em></p>
<p>We've been curating these multi-media dreamrock concert experiences for a several years now but never on this scale.</p>
<p>Come with us to make something <strong>amazing</strong> happen.</p>
<p>We need your help to launch LUCY into the SKY with TIGERS!</p>

<p>LBRC Needs You!</p>
<p>Our Mission: LondonBRC’s (LBRC) goal is to bring some of the iconic structures of London (House of Commons/Houses of Parliament, Tower Bridge and Tower of London) to the Playa of Black Rock City as a fully functioning interactive art installation for Burning Man 2013.  With the hope of incorporating the integral elements of these landmarks into the landscape of community, culture and core principles that is <a href=""http://www.burningman.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""The Burning Man Project"">The Burning Man Project</a>. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>THE ORANGE MARTINI PROJECT-Modernism Today </p>
<p>A one-of-a-kind art exhibit featuring lenticular prints that ""move"" when viewed from different angles, and showcases fun, Palm Springs lifestyle scenes, photographed by Lani Garfield. The series of 9 prints will be unveiled at the Palm Springs Hilton lobby as part of Modernism Week on February 13, 2013, and also along Palm Canyon in participating uptown district stores.  Proceeds from these two shows will go to The Palm Springs High School Arts Institute.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The Orange Martini Project is a series of unconventionally displayed photographs featuring Palm Springs and it's amazing community. With participation from various local friends, artists, businesses, and even the mayor- Lani has been able to capture the essence of the Modern lifestyle here in PS. The lenticular prints will show a scene in ""motion"" when viewed from one side or another. The allure of this fair city, which is dedicated to the appreciation and preservation of modernist architecture, design, and living, has served in the past and present as a playground to the stars and it's residents.  The interactive display showcases the hip, locally found clothes and iconic mid-century modern architecture in a way that blurs the line between today and the days when The Rat Pack stayed and played in the desert.</p>
<p> ""It's not just about looking backwards with nostalgia"", Garfield explains. ""It's about looking forward. It's how we live today in a place with a colorful, fun, architecturally significant history."" </p>
<p> The series of nine 24x36"" limited edition, signed and numbered, lenticular prints will be displayed at the Palm Springs Hilton, as well as 9 retailers and restaurants throughout the Uptown Design District of Palm Springs. Visitors are encouraged to enjoy a ""Passport to Palm Springs"" adventure and visit all 9 businesses on a ""hunt"" for all 9 prints. A passport can be picked up at any of the locations to start with, and at each stop a ""passport stamp"" will be given. Full passports can be redeemed for a complimentary Orange Martini from participating restaurants included in the hunt! Smaller 5x7 cards of the series will be available in a limited run. Print proceeds go to The Arts Institute at PSHS. </p>
<p> The Arts Institute at Palm Springs High School is a model arts education program offering interested high school students enhanced learning experiences for artistic growth, preparing them for educational and job opportunities in the arts beyond high school. One of the key programs provided is the ""Mentoring Program"". Students receive real-life experience with an established artist in their art trade and learn how they can turn their passion for art into a career. For the past 5 years Lani has mentored 2 students a year and taught them the practical working  knowledge of photography as they enter her world of photographing ""the jet set"" here in Palm Springs. </p>

<p>We have put together, again with the generosity of our community, some fantastic reward packages! We have packages for locals and out of town guests, limited edition signed and numbered, lenticular prints from the series, behind the scenes video from the shoots, and tickets to be the first to see the series in print at our fabulous opening night gala where the Orange Martinis will be flowing and you can mix and mingle with some of the hippest people in town- the models and crew from all 9 OMP shoots and the project's valued supporters!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Arts Institute at Palm Springs High School is a very important organization to me. Our creative programs like art, photography, film and fashion are drastically underfunded. The Atrs Institute makes funds for field trips and supplies available that the teachers would otherwise have to pay for out of their own pockets. Creativite problem solving is a valuable resource in our world, the young minds of today deserve better oppertunities for becoming the creative leaders and innovators of tomorrow. I have personally worked with several students over the years as part of the mentoring program, and seeing these amazing young people with infinite potential and limited recources is saddening. Your contribution to this campaign is really a contribution to them. The Arts Institute awards scholarships for local college students as well, providing the financial assistance an otherwise unattainable valued education. An education that will assure them a stronger foothold in the professional world to today. </p>

THE ORANGE MARTINI PROJECT-Modernism Today 
A one-of-a-kind art exhibit featuring lenticular prints that ""move"" when viewed from different angles, and showcases fun, Palm Springs lifestyle scenes, photographed by Lani Garfield. The series of 9 prints will be unveiled at the Palm Springs Hilton lobby as part of Modernism Week on February 13, 2013, and also along Palm Canyon in participating uptown district stores.  Proceeds from these two shows will go to The Palm Springs High School Arts Institute.
 
 The Orange Martini Project is a series of unconventionally displayed photographs featuring Palm Springs and it's amazing community. With participation from various local friends, artists, businesses, and even the mayor- Lani has been able to capture the essence of the Modern lifestyle here in PS. The lenticular prints will show a scene in ""motion"" when viewed from one side or another. The allure of this fair city, which is dedicated to the appreciation and preservation of modernist architecture, design, and living, has served in the past and present as a playground to the stars and it's residents.  The interactive display showcases the hip, locally found clothes and iconic mid-century modern architecture in a way that blurs the line between today and the days when The Rat Pack stayed and played in the desert.
 ""It's not just about looking backwards with nostalgia"", Garfield explains. ""It's about looking forward. It's how we live today in a place with a colorful, fun, architecturally significant history."" 
 The series of nine 24x36"" limited edition, signed and numbered, lenticular prints will be displayed at the Palm Springs Hilton, as well as 9 retailers and restaurants throughout the Uptown Design District of Palm Springs. Visitors are encouraged to enjoy a ""Passport to Palm Springs"" adventure and visit all 9 businesses on a ""hunt"" for all 9 prints. A passport can be picked up at any of the locations to start with, and at each stop a ""passport stamp"" will be given. Full passports can be redeemed for a complimentary Orange Martini from participating restaurants included in the hunt! Smaller 5x7 cards of the series will be available in a limited run. Print proceeds go to The Arts Institute at PSHS. 
 The Arts Institute at Palm Springs High School is a model arts education program offering interested high school students enhanced learning experiences for artistic growth, preparing them for educational and job opportunities in the arts beyond high school. One of the key programs provided is the ""Mentoring Program"". Students receive real-life experience with an established artist in their art trade and learn how they can turn their passion for art into a career. For the past 5 years Lani has mentored 2 students a year and taught them the practical working  knowledge of photography as they enter her world of photographing ""the jet set"" here in Palm Springs.

And to initiate more of the “wow-factor,” they also pilot giant robotic machines reminiscent of Gundam and Armored Core. These science fiction characters consist of both humans and aliens that used to be at war with each other but have long since formed an alliance in the wake of a catastrophe that threatened the existence of every being in the universe. There are Halo-like “super soldiers,” as well as warrior alien races, and those that rely purely on telepathic means of combat. </p><p>But even in the face of such overwhelming numbers and sophisticated technology the<br/>Inhabitants of the planet of Mystic Earth are not without defense. They wield magic and have built their civilizations around its practice. Think of it as World of Warcraft, meets Skyrim, Jade Empire, The Lord of the Rings, Lineage, Dark Souls, Guild Wars, and Monster Hunter. This world is filled with castles, dungeons, floating cities, monasteries, and sacred temples, and is populated by elves, orcs, enormous dragon-like beasts, fairies, werewolves, vampires, undead, ghosts, giant golems, gods, mythic beings, humans of international descent(the world has medieval knights, Vikings, and samurais) as well as a plethora of other fantasy-based character types.</p><p>The main plot of this story revolves around the magic that resides within everything that lives on the planet. The sci-fi based settlers refer to it as “Mystic Particle” energy, while the native peoples call it “magic,” plain and simple. Mystic Energy though is in and of itself a technology that requires extensive study and practice in order to manipulate it to achieve a desired effect; as is often taught by mage guilds and wizardry halls. But what makes this energy so unique is that it can only be wielded by those born on the planet, and those that have an ancestry dating back to its birth, meaning that the settlers and even their future children don’t have the possibility of being able to produce and retain Mystic Particles.</p><p>This is the crux of the division. Those born within the depths of space have an ancestry that have experienced millenniums of countless extraordinary technological advancements, and as a result, have technology integrated into their very being. Whether it’s as subtle as cellular nano machines, or as visually apparent as a cybernetic body enhancement, technology is a part of their very existence, just as magic is a part of the Mystics themselves.</p><p>In this world, magic and technology are two very different things, and both refuse to function when wielded by an operator of the opposite side. For example, a Mystic-born can’t pilot a machine, or use a radiofrequency communication device; the Mystic Particles will short-circuit the devices, rendering them inoperable. And non-mystic, technology based individuals (often referred to as “Techs” for short) can’t bend the elements to their will, or use a rune stone to magically transport themselves from one place to another; nothing will happen because Mystic Particles are required.</p><p>Centuries of war have plagued the relationship and continue to stifle any chances of an overture for peace. Both sides see the other as the cause of the problem. Mystics view those coming from outer space as invaders, while the non-Mystic, technology based, Techs view their relocation to the planet as their only available option for survival, and think that the planet has more than enough room for more inhabitants. And on top of all that, the lands of Mystic Earth are divided into varying races and societies that often don’t take too kindly to Mystics of a different race and culture. So, as you can see, the politics of Mystic Earth can get pretty complicated.</p><p>Unless an uncommon union between a Mystic and a Tech births a “synchronized” child, there will be no hope for the two worlds of science and magic to come to understand each other. A Synced, half-breed child could be able to walk among both worlds and understand the secrets of each.</p><p>And of course, what sci-fi story would be complete without something reminiscent of<br/>the aliens from aliens, the flood, the reapers, and the necromorphs from Dead Space. After all, why is it that the inhabitants of a vast and expansive universe are all running to the refuge of a single planet? Think about it. This story has bone-chilling horrors of its own.</p><p> </p><h4>An Unconventional Project:</h4><p>What makes this project different than your standard story project is that I want to<br/>make it a point that we don’t set any main characters, but instead focus on the setting of the stage, communicating the vision of the world in terms of environments and character types. Think of this project more as an encyclopedia and not a novel (although excerpts in a novel-like format may also be presented). In my opinion, this offers more room for expansion in case other writers get involved in the future, and offers the possibility of unrelated storylines and the birth of a truly infinite Intellectual Property.</p><p>What we are going to do if this project is successful is that we are going to send the<br/>artists involved a more detailed brief of the world, and they’ll decide what it is that they’ll want to paint. Overall, they are going to have pretty much free-reign on the design concepts, because I believe that the sheer amount of diversity within this world demands it. </p><p>References for this universe, so that you can get an idea of the sci-fi and fantasy<br/>aspects of it, include but are not limited to:</p><p><b><i>For Sci-Fi</i></b></p><p>Star Wars, Star Trek, Halo, Mass Effect, Aliens, Dead Space, Gears of War, Star<br/>Craft, Zone of Enders, Gundam, Armored Core, and Appleseed.</p><p><b><i>And For Fantasy</i></b></p><p>World of WarCraft, The elder scrolls Skyrim, Jade Empire, The Lord of the rings,<br/>Guild Wars, Lineage, Final Fantasy, Dark Souls, Escaflowne, and Monster Hunter.</p><p>On a more official note, this project is intended to be used to gain the attention<br/>of the largest firms within the entertainment industry, so the submission of this concept alone will not be enough; it needs to be backed up by some of the most extraordinary art ever seen. That is why we need to put together this book.</p><p>I am going to be honest in that I believe that this Story has the potential to be the next huge multibillion dollar IP that spans across the media formats of Film, video games, toys, and novels. That is the intention of this endeavor; to gain the attention of major film companies like Disney, and AAA video game development studios. But that potential can only be reached with the help of sci-fi and fantasy enthusiasts like you. A person can have a good idea, but without the means to express that idea in terms of a visual medium, there is no way that a person will be able to gain the attention of potential investors, and the idea will never see the light of day.</p><p><br/> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>We are looking to initiate a project of incredible ambition. Think of it as a world comprised of various sci-fi and fantasy stories all wrapped up together into one gargantuan package with a coherent plot-line in terms of the setting of a universe with<br/>infinite possibilities.</p><p>Political intrigue presented through a clash of civilizations within the realms of science fiction and fantasy has never been done like this before, and with such an enormous stable of designers and illustrators this concept can be brought to life with jaw-dropping flare and efficiency with the potential of sparking a dialog that had been previously abandoned within the field of entertainment for reasons rooted in marketability.</p><p>Mystic Earth though is different. It is not a mindless battle-fest of elves vs space marines, but is instead a story, a world that relates to the experiences of our own human history, and even though war and death is present throughout, conveys an underlying message of peace and friendship over hostilities, dialog over war, and that regardless of race, species, belief, technology, or place of birth, people can still learn<br/>to understand each other even during the most lethal of times.</p><p>This art book/encyclopedia of Mystic Earth will be the start that gains the attention of the industry and will lead to this idea being expanded upon through books written by your favorite authors, movies played by your favorite actors, and video games made<br/>by your favorite studios, as well as this concept being expanded upon through every other platform of entertainment. This idea will excite people’s imaginations so that they can see that all types of protagonists and unique stories can be made within a universe such as this. Seriously, this project will be a vessel that we can use to show the world that this concept of combining sci-fi and fantasy, two of the most financially successful genres in history, is something worth investing in. </p><p>The entire concept of this project runs on its potential. The question of what can we achieve with this is what drives this endeavor into Mystic Earth. If you are a fan of both science fiction and fantasy and want to see both presented in a way that has never been done before, and want to breathe life into a concept that has the potential to change the landscape of what the entertainment industry thinks can be done with<br/>both genres, then you should support this project and step into a universe whose potential is that of incredible proportions.</p><p>So if you are interested in a unique project that crosses genres in a way that has not been explored all that much in the main-stream, but has the potential to become the next big thing, in movies (think The Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars), in games (think Mass Effect meets Skyrim), and in tv shows (think Game of Thrones meets Galactica), and if you want to see something like this happen, to see sci-fi vs fantasy as a valid cross-genre and presented through all forms of entertainment, then you should let the industry know that there is a demand for this, and join with us in making<br/>this project a reality.</p><p> </p><h3>A universe such as this can only be made possible with your help!</h3><p>Please spread the word about this project. Only when the entertainment industry sees that there is a demand for something like this will this concept of bringing sci-fi vs fantasy to the mainstream be given a chance.</p><p>By commissioning these artists to put together this book we'll be able to show the world the possibilities that a universe like this presents. But it is only with your help that we can spread the word to get enough people to join in on this.</p><p>What you will be getting if you support this project will not only be an incredible art book that shows and explains to you the wonders and conflicts of this universe, but you will also be paving the way for sci-fi vs fantasy to be brought to every other platform of entertainment simply because of the potential that an opportunity such as this presents.</p><p>So please, spread the word as much as you can, through facebook, twitter, and everywhere else! Because it is only with your help that we can succeed in changing the landscape of the industry, and bring life to that which we have always wanted to see in movies, and video games, and to read about in novels.</p><p>Every person that donates 30$ or more will have their name written in this book, and those that purchace a physical copy will be able to submit text next to their name inside the book that explains why they want to see sci-fi vs fantasy brought to the mainstream of entertainment and what they hope this book will achieve.</p><p>Let the world forever know that you had something to do with bringing this concept to a reality! And remember that the main goal of this campaign is to spark a science fiction vs fantasy revolution of ideas... Support us to become a part of it! :D</p></div>","Summary: An Art Book/Encyclopedia Of An Innovative UniverseMystic Earth: The Infinite Fantasy will be a story that crosses the barriers of science fiction and fantasy, merging the two into a science fantasy drama.An enormous planet nearly 10 times the size of our Earth comes under siege andoccupation by seemingly endless waves of science-fiction based settlers whose technology rivals that of Star Trek, Star Wars, Halo, Mass Effect, and Titan Fall.

Think of it as a world comprised of various sci-fi and fantasy stories all wrapped up together into one gargantuan package with a coherent plot-line in terms of the setting of a universe withinfinite possibilities.Political intrigue presented through a clash of civilizations within the realms of science fiction and fantasy has never been done like this before, and with such an enormous stable of designers and illustrators this concept can be brought to life with jaw-dropping flare and efficiency with the potential of sparking a dialog that had been previously abandoned within the field of entertainment for reasons rooted in marketability.Mystic Earth though is different. It is not a mindless battle-fest of elves vs space marines, but is instead a story, a world that relates to the experiences of our own human history, and even though war and death is present throughout, conveys an underlying message of peace and friendship over hostilities, dialog over war, and that regardless of race, species, belief, technology, or place of birth, people can still learnto understand each other even during the most lethal of times.This art book/encyclopedia of Mystic Earth will be the start that gains the attention of the industry and will lead to this idea being expanded upon through books written by your favorite authors, movies played by your favorite actors, and video games madeby your favorite studios, as well as this concept being expanded upon through every other platform of entertainment. This idea will excite people’s imaginations so that they can see that all types of protagonists and unique stories can be made within a universe such as this. Seriously, this project will be a vessel that we can use to show the world that this concept of combining sci-fi and fantasy, two of the most financially successful genres in history, is something worth investing in. The entire concept of this project runs on its potential. The question of what can we achieve with this is what drives this endeavor into Mystic Earth. If you are a fan of both science fiction and fantasy and want to see both presented in a way that has never been done before, and want to breathe life into a concept that has the potential to change the landscape of what the entertainment industry thinks can be done withboth genres, then you should support this project and step into a universe whose potential is that of incredible proportions.So if you are interested in a unique project that crosses genres in a way that has not been explored all that much in the main-stream, but has the potential to become the next big thing, in movies (think The Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars), in games (think Mass Effect meets Skyrim), and in tv shows (think Game of Thrones meets Galactica), and if you want to see something like this happen, to see sci-fi vs fantasy as a valid cross-genre and presented through all forms of entertainment, then you should let the industry know that there is a demand for this, and join with us in makingthis project a reality. A universe such as this can only be made possible with your help!Please spread the word about this project. Only when the entertainment industry sees that there is a demand for something like this will this concept of bringing sci-fi vs fantasy to the mainstream be given a chance.By commissioning these artists to put together this book we'll be able to show the world the possibilities that a universe like this presents. But it is only with your help that we can spread the word to get enough people to join in on this.What you will be getting if you support this project will not only be an incredible art book that shows and explains to you the wonders and conflicts of this universe, but you will also be paving the way for sci-fi vs fantasy to be brought to every other platform of entertainment simply because of the potential that an opportunity such as this presents.So please, spread the word as much as you can, through facebook, twitter, and everywhere else! Because it is only with your help that we can succeed in changing the landscape of the industry, and bring life to that which we have always wanted to see in movies, and video games, and to read about in novels.Every person that donates 30$ or more will have their name written in this book, and those that purchace a physical copy will be able to submit text next to their name inside the book that explains why they want to see sci-fi vs fantasy brought to the mainstream of entertainment and what they hope this book will achieve.Let the world forever know that you had something to do with bringing this concept to a reality! And remember that the main goal of this campaign is to spark a science fiction vs fantasy revolution of ideas... Support us to become a part of it! :D",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Novo Doba</strong> is a festival of non-aligned comics happening in and around Zemun and Belgrade (Serbia) at this time of the year. This autumn we are preparing the ninth edition of love and madness for you with a selected program of eye-opening visuals and exquisite experimental music.  Nine years is a long time for an underground festival, we are entering middle age. Too old to be stopped, too experienced to be naive, too stubborn to slow down – we named the edition <strong>STRONGER FIRE</strong>. The festival vision is an intersection between visual arts, experimental music, small-press publishing, people, places and production. If you are in the neighborhood, come by and join the circus. If you can't come by, please consider getting some perks from this campaign. We can do so much with so little.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want to get the museum open before the coming general election. We hope the museum could become an educational resource, provide inspiration for activists and an opportunity for the media to talk about an economic and social ideology that has remained invisible, even while the violence it has enacted in people's lives has not.</p>

If we don't reach our funding goal we will take what funds we do raise and use that to fund the initial launch and apply for other funding sources to keep the museum open as long as possible.
If we reach surpass our funding goal we will be able to start working on expanding the museum for a UK tour, as well as produce a museum catalogue (which will be available as a stretch reward) and put money into promotion.


The Impact
We want to get the museum open before the coming general election. We hope the museum could become an educational resource, provide inspiration for activists and an opportunity for the media to talk about an economic and social ideology that has remained invisible, even while the violence it has enacted in people's lives has not.

 
Risks & Challenges
Leegate Shopping Centre, where we're opening the museum, is planned to be demolished eventually by developers, but we very much doubt that will happen for at least another year.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't chip-in financially, there are other ways you can help. There are a few items we need for displays that would be gratefully received

iPhone 4 or Android phone (needs to be able to run VLC)
Plug extensions, 4-ways etc.
Computer monitor or flat screen TV
CCTV systems/individual cameras

In terms of helping with the build, we're looking for people who can

Do carpentry/joinery
Transport a perspex box from Leicester to London
Drop off leaflets at tourist spots/hotels etc

'When I go into the glass houses and I see the strange plants of exotic lands, it seems to me that I enter into a dream.' Henri Rousseau

As an artist I am inspired by this quote by the French painter Henri Rousseau. It describes why he kept coming back to the Jardin des plantes, the botanical gardens in Paris, to find motifs and inspiration. In my paintings and photographic collages I create imagined landscapes including elements taken from reality. The results are dreamlike scenes with a reference to both surrealism and magical realism.

My imaginative landscape visions will be on display at Kibble Palace, the glass house in Glasgow Botanic Gardens, next spring, and it is my very first public exhibition.

I am also arranging three workshops for local children during the exhibition period, to support them in their creative process and help them use their imagination to create both paintings and collages. 


What We Need & What You Get
I need $4900 to cover all cost of material and studio rent. The material includes:
• Stretchers and canvas for eight paintings• Acrylic and oil paint for eight paintings• Brushes• Fabric and wire for sculptures• Materials for eight prints on aluminium• Studio rent for three months
 
If I do not reach my target, the money raised will still go into my artistic practice, and in creating a new body of work, which is called 'Life Beneath The Surface'.  



You will be helping contribute to:
• Bringing art closer to where people live• Supporting local children in their creative process• Helping the artist cover her material costs

<h3>A New Home For Ceramics</h3>
<p>We started <a href=""https://saltstoneceramics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Saltstone Ceramics</a> with the idea that an <strong>arts practice is an essential part of a well-balanced life</strong>. Since 2015 we've been teaching four students at a time how to get their hands dirty and bring art into their lives.</p>
<p>But we learned early on that, despite the huge demand for instruction, there was just no way for us to grow the classroom at our house. So for the past six months we've been scouring the city, looking for the perfect new home for our burgeoning community of artists and craftspeople.</p>
<p>And we found it! <strong>In the heart of Wallingford we discovered a beautiful, sunny space that is ready to be transformed into Seattle's newest arts center</strong>. We'll have room to triple the number of students and provide a home base for up to a dozen working artists. And we'll be able to provide a gallery to introduce Seattle to the best emerging and contemporary ceramicists from the Pacific Northwest and beyond.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The new space is basically just an empty box with old wires and pipes. <strong>We need to put in everything from a new floor to new sinks to new paint on the ceiling. </strong>We're buying new pottery wheels, a new kiln, and miles of storage racks. We need lightbulbs, mops, and all kinds of furniture to make the space useful.</p>
<p>We're committed to doing a ton of the work—we've already laid the new floor ourselves! But even so, <strong>getting this new studio ready is going to cost close to $50,000</strong>. Here's just a small part of our shopping list:</p>
<ul>
<li>New waterproof moppable floor: $5,000</li>
<li>8 new wheels with stools: $6,000</li>
<li>Kiln: $4,000</li>
<li>Four sinks, installed and plumbed: $5,000</li>
<li>Storefront sign: $2,500</li>
</ul>
<p>We really believe in the value of this project, and we're investing $30,000 of our own savings (plus an entire summer of sweat equity) to bring the new shop to life. But<strong> </strong>we need you to help us bridge the funding gap. With your support we can hit the ground running and <strong>show Seattle just how essential art spaces are</strong> to the life of the city.</p>
<p>We've got fantastic perks to thank supporters. We're especially proud of our <strong>new community-centered logo</strong>. We've put it on the usual assortment of t-shirts and aprons and stickers, but the special-edition, once-in-a-lifetime backer's mugs are where it's really going to shine—literally! We're using real gold to transfer the logo onto the mugs (don't worry, it's not as complicated as it sounds).</p>
<p>Plus we're offering discounted gift certificates, a pottery party, and even a bit of woodworking for those of you who aren't into clay.</p>
<p>(Also note that images of perks are representative and might change.)</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p><strong>The Jon Selikoff Collection houses a fantastic variety of antique wood type that has been printing posters, playbills, broadsides, and any other type of printed matter you can think of since the turn of the 19th century. I was given the opportunity to acquire Jon's collection and carry on his legacy after his passing last year. I want to share the collection with printers, designers, type enthusiasts, and any other kind of letter lover out there through a monthly poster subscription.</strong> <strong>Each month I will research one of the typefaces in the collection and create a new poster that draws from the history of type specimens and catalogs while adding to the current poster design revival. A one year subscription will come with 12 unique limited edition posters and it will do a world of good towards funding the necessary research and design time needed for a project like this. There is also 6 month subscription, as well as a single month option that allows you to choose which month you wish to receive a poster.  ​This project will continue Jon's mission by spreading love for wood type and letterpress. To honor his memory, 5% of all proceeds from this campaign will go to the ALSA Greater NY Chapter.</strong></p>

My name is Ingrid Schindall and I am the owner of <a href=""http://www.isprojectsfl.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">IS Projects</a>, a public-access printmaking and book arts studio in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I was recently given the opportunity to acquire the late Jon Selikoff’s letterpress collection formerly known as Vote For Letterpress. The collection contains an astounding and diverse array of antique wood type, lead type and two presses that will be an incredible resource for local and visiting artists. The collection is a huge investment that serendipitously provides me with the resources to start an undertaking that I’ve been dreaming of for years, a monthly type specimen subscription project. I need your help to get this project off the ground and make the Selikoff Collection a sustainable and cherished part of IS Projects that can be celebrated by type enthusiasts everywhere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A brief history of the Selikoff Collection:</strong></p>
<p>Vote For Letterpress was founded by Jon Selikoff in 2010 after he decided to take a leap and purchase an entire letterpress shop in Ithaca, New York, and move it to West Orange, New Jersey. Jon was running his own branding design company at the time and wanted a way to escape the digital world in his downtime and get his hands inky. Through the years of operation at Vote For Letterpress, Jon collaborated with several artists and designers to complete all different kinds of letterpress projects that pushed the medium forward and challenged the traditional notions of what letterpress can be. Sadly, Jon passed away in November last year, after a long, brave battle with ALS, leaving Vote For Letterpress without a proprietor. His family and friends wanted to be sure that his memory would be honored, and that his collection, which brought him so much joy, would remain intact. The collection will live on at IS Projects as the Jon Selikoff Collection, where it will continue to inspire contemporary printmakers to push the boundaries of letterpress and also honor and cherish the history of the craft. There's a bunch more info about Jon and the shop on the Vote For Letterpress <a href=""http://www.voteforletterpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> and you can check out articles written about his work <a href=""http://www.printmag.com/designer-profiles/remember-design-legend-jonathan-selikoff/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.neenahpaperblog.com/2016/06/jon-selikoff/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>

<p><strong>A little bit about IS Projects:</strong></p>
<p>IS Projects is an independent public access printmaking studio in Fort Lauderdale, FL. It is the only studio of its kind in South Florida, providing training and access for local and visiting artists to printmaking and bookbinding equipment. It’s the only public access printmaking studio in South Florida and, as such, is vital resource to local and visiting artists who are interested in establishing their own printmaking practice. Based in the FATVillage Arts District, IS Projects enjoys hundreds of visitors each month during the FATVillage Artwalk as well as national and international visitors interested in all things art and printmaking. Since its opening in September 2014, I have, as the founder and director, worked tirelessly to cultivate a cohesive, supportive, and collaborative printmaking community in South Florida. My other main mission at the studio is to stimulate the evolution of printmaking and letterpress by encouraging contemporary artists to try the medium and push it to its limits. The Selikoff Collection is an incredible resource for the studio and all of the artists who work here. You can find out more about what IS Projects is all about and what we're up to on our <a href=""http://www.isprojectsfl.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>.</p>

<h3>Why does this matter?</h3>
<p>This project is a celebration of the history of this collection as well as the history of the typefaces housed within it. Jon was an amazing man and top notch designer, he acquired most of his collection from a single printshop and now I am honoring the legacy of that shop and Jon’s shop by ensuring that this collection stays intact. I place a large value on the history of printing equipment and often ponder what a drawer of type or a press has printed before. All of my current presses are named after the printer that previously owned them as a way to preserve that piece of their history. This collection will be named the Jon Selikoff collection when it joins my studio as a way to celebrate Jon’s accomplishments and memory.</p>
<p>Letterpress lovers dream of having access to a collection as diverse and expansive as the Selikoff Collection and under the watchful eyes of IS Projects staff the collection will be able to be loved and preserved through use. IS Projects is a public access shop which means that we offer workshops, studio rental, tours, and demonstrations to anyone looking to get involved and get inky. We promote the continued evolution of letterpress printing through education and by encouraging contemporary artists and hobby printers to learn and practice.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why do I need your help?</h3>
<p>A project like this will require a considerable amount of time and energy each month out of my already intense business. Your funds will go toward making sure that I have the financial backing to step away from workshops and commissions for a bit each month and put in the hours of research, design, and printing that will be needed to make this project successful. As anyone who has tried their hand at letterpress printing knows, when time is money, you spend a lot more on design and set up than you ever could on materials.</p>
<p>Don't forget, 5% of all the proceeds from this project will be donated to the ALSA in Jon's Memory.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What will the posters look like?</h3>
<p>In planning this project, I’ve developed an affinity for pangrams which are the perfect tool for showing off a complete typeface because they are sentences that include every letter of the alphabet. It was only after creating the first pangram for the project that I realized that JOn shared a similar interest in pangrams and, in fact, had a whole page dedicated to them on the Vote For Letterpress <a href=""http://voteforletterpress.com/pangrams/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Website</a>. In the first iteration of the poster project, I wrote a pangram inspired by the information that surfaced in my research on JB McCullagh. Each month I’ll write a new pangram that is somehow inspired by discoveries in the research, the aesthetics of the typeface itself, or the historical or contemporary uses for the typeface.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521221447/ry69hmqltkk37zcjkgsu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This is the first poster in the series with type from my personal collection. The color pallet is based on the portrait I found of JB McCullagh, the man the typeface was named after (pictured below.)</p>

<p>Here's a shot of the second poster in the series and the first to use type from the Selikoff Collection after its move to South Florida. Tuscan Extended is a wacky and polarizing typeface. What do you think of it?</p>

</div><h3><i>Serendipities </i></h3><p><strong>Here are a few other conspicuous and endearing coincidences surrounding this acquisition that I thought you as a supporter might find interesting.</strong></p><ul>
<li>From Chris Fritton, the Itinerant Printer:  ""I started The Itinerant Printer trip on January 26, 2015 at IS Projects in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, with Ingrid Schindall. I concluded the trip April 23, 2017, at Vote for Letterpress in Orange, NJ, with Jon Selikoff. If Ingrid were to purchase Jon’s legacy shop, the equipment from the very last shop I went to would be coming full-circle to the very first shop I visited on the journey. I don’t usually believe in fate, or kismet, or destiny, but were Ingrid to acquire this shop, it would bring things full circle in this small community of letterpress printers in a way that I never dreamed possible, and it would make for a beautiful, meaningful story about life, love, and what it means to be involved in a craft.”</li>
<li>In September 2015, Craig Ward and Linden Gledhill launched a Kickstarter campaign to letterpress print glyphs made from macro photographs of ferrofluid. My mom supported this campaign by ordering a print of the glyphs. The print was letterpress printed at Vote For Letterpress by Jon on his Vandercook SP20 that will be moving to Fort Lauderdale as a part of this collection. So there has been a print from Jon’s shop in my family’s home for a few years now acting as an ambassador to a shop that we never imagined we would get this involved with.</li>
<li>I learned about letterpress printing when I was at the Maryland Institute College of Art and the very first press I ever used was a Vandercook SP20. It was my favorite press throughout my time at MICA and I still think about it whenever I’m printing large format work on my SP15. I have been searching for an SP20 or SP25 for a years. When Chris sent me a draft of the text for his upcoming book, in my response I threw in the sentence “Also, if you hear of anyone selling an SP20 or SP25 PLEASE let me know.” at the end of the email without any real expectations. Chris responded a few minutes later with the information Jon’s shop including images from his visit to Vote For Letterpress. I never dreamed that I would get the opportunity to acquire a collection like this, lots of printer friends have told me that they got their collection through a once in a lifetime “unicorn” chance that came just at the right time for them and that’s what this shop is for me.  </li>
</ul><p> </p><p>All photos of Vote For Letterpress are courtesy of Cyndi Shattuck Photography</p></div>","The Jon Selikoff Collection houses a fantastic variety of antique wood type that has been printing posters, playbills, broadsides, and any other type of printed matter you can think of since the turn of the 19th century. I was given the opportunity to acquire Jon's collection and carry on his legacy after his passing last year. I want to share the collection with printers, designers, type enthusiasts, and any other kind of letter lover out there through a monthly poster subscription. Each month I will research one of the typefaces in the collection and create a new poster that draws from the history of type specimens and catalogs while adding to the current poster design revival. A one year subscription will come with 12 unique limited edition posters and it will do a world of good towards funding the necessary research and design time needed for a project like this. There is also 6 month subscription, as well as a single month option that allows you to choose which month you wish to receive a poster.  ​This project will continue Jon's mission by spreading love for wood type and letterpress. To honor his memory, 5% of all proceeds from this campaign will go to the ALSA Greater NY Chapter.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Chris McMullen and I am a Seattle artist who creates interactive, kinetic sculpture.</p>
<p>The GlobalArtAffairs Foundation has asked me to be part of “Time Space Existence,” the large art and architecture exhibition they organize bi-annually in the context of the Venice Architecture Biennale and I am thrilled to have received this distinctive invitation.</p>
<p>The exhibition is hosted and supported by the European Cultural Centre and will be presented in Palazzo Mora, Palazzo Bembo and Marinaressa Gardens in Venice Italy. The Venice Architectural Biennale addresses the academic side of architecture and provides an opportunity for architects and designers from around the world to showcase new projects.</p>
<p>Within “Time Space Existence,” there will be approximately 150 architects. I am one of only 30 sculptors who have been invited to participate this year which contributes to the extraordinary nature of this opportunity. The exhibition runs from May 26th through November 26th in 2018.</p>
<p>With more than 300,000 people expected to attend, exposure on this scale has the potential to provide me with further opportunity and support.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>A little about my sculpture</strong></h2>
<p>This is Infrastructure, my most recent solo exhibition which ran Sept.-Oct. 2017 at Oxbow in Seattle, WA. This work represents the massive infrastructure that has been built and is required to move people and products back and forth, throughout the world, and works as a metaphor for the push-pull of interests constantly trying to get their way.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515806940/ndcjnyjt1x42lwfbp61z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The installation consisted of two interactive, articulated cranes. Each crane invited up to three visitors to synchronize their interaction and communicate with one another in order to operate the crane and use it to stack blocks on to the scales next to them. When one scale out weighed the other, the trolley car mounted to the ceiling moved across the room.</p>
<p>I wanted to provide an opportunity for people to interact with the sculpture, and each other. It was very gratifying to see how they interacted with the work, how they perceived the challenge, and to witness the satisfaction and achievement they ultimately found as a result of their participation. This proved to be a remarkable experience. Groups of strangers encouraged each other and burst into applause and cheered when a block was hooked and successfully stacked on the scale.</p>

<p>The exhibition also included wall-mounted sculptures. Visitors were invited to turn a wheel which moved freight cars along the wall.  This is an experience where the turning of the wheel somehow takes you to a selfless place of wonder. The feedback in the wheel, coupled with the weighty sound of steel riding on steel creates a soothing and gratifying rhythm.</p>

<h2><strong>Why I am asking for support</strong></h2>
<p>I have been working toward an opportunity to share my work internationally for many years and it has arrived. All the sculptures I have created in the last 18 years have been primarily self-funded but this opportunity comes with much greater expense than any of my previous endeavors. So I am reaching out to our local community and beyond. Any support you can provide would be genuinely appreciated.</p>
<p>All money donated will assist me in the creation and shipping of the sculpture as well as a little help with travel and lodging costs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515808755/jmobsyrxi4ytpuocwhhl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>All funds raised will go directly to funding this endeavor.</p>
<p>Any contribution will be greatly appreciated. Please share this campaign far and wide.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your support!</strong></p>

All the sculptures I have created in the last 18 years have been primarily self-funded but this opportunity comes with much greater expense than any of my previous endeavors. So I am reaching out to our local community and beyond. Any support you can provide would be genuinely appreciated.
All money donated will assist me in the creation and shipping of the sculpture as well as a little help with travel and lodging costs.

All funds raised will go directly to funding this endeavor.
Any contribution will be greatly appreciated. Please share this campaign far and wide.
Thank you for your support!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

Inspired by community involvement in the project and the experience of putting on a large 'CBC' exhibition, I have for the last few years been co-curating, with my friend Rebecca Wyn Kelly, a sequence of grassroots exhibitions called 'Art in the Warehouse', which provides a chance for emerging artists to show their work in an exciting and vibrant arena. Fotofringe 2013 was held as part of 'AITW' last May, in three different settings, giving over 20 photographers exposure in an unconventional and stimulating way. Rather than using established galleries, work was shown in a pub skittle alley, our warehouse, or postered directly onto city street walls.

Meet the authors – professionals, artists, children, workers, students, parents, including  Jean Barbe, Normand Baillargeon, IVY, Hugo, Latulippe, Nicolas Lévesque, Catherine Lalonde, Queen KA, 22avril.org, Pink Bloc, le Regroupement des groupes écologistes du Québec, La Boîte Rouge, Fermaille, ArchiContre, and so many others who will forgive us we hope for not citing them here – the complete author list is regularly updated here.
Readings.
Presentation table: author visibility for those who are interested (artists, collectives, organizations etc.)
Several guest musicians and a SHOW POUR UN PRINTEMPS
Full media coverage, courtesy of La Boîte Rouge.
Altogether, if we strictly count the printing cost for a first edition of the book along with the costs for the organization of the book launch event (renting a space + equipment and services), the bill is over 7,000 $.
Therefore, we hope to raise that amount thanks to this Indiegogo funding campaing – this is the least we can get away with if we want to guarantee reaching our goals for this project. If we exceed that amount, even better! Depending on the total funds we collect we might even be able to print a higher number of copies for the first edition… and/or give away even more free copies the night of the launch (first edition).
Artmour is a not-for-profit organization and all Indiegogo donations will go toward the Pour un Printemps project. Any funds left over, whether they are accumulated through this fundraiser or through book sales, will be used in the following manner:  

Reimbursing costs for printing the first edition of the book or for organizing the book launch which were not covered by this fundraiser.
Printing a second edition of the book.
Eventually producing an e-book version.
Funding future creative projects organized by Artmour, still within this goal of encouraging citizen expression, participation, cooperation and development for a more just, equal and democratic society.
Artmour will submit a full report on the project website detailing the funds collected as well as the actual project costs (after the launch, June 2012). Artmour is a registered organization and is legally accountable for its use of donated funds.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>My name is Jack Tapestry. I have been a competing slam poet in OKC for 15 years. This year I qualified for a place on a team of four poets that will represent our city at  21st Annual Southern Fried Poetry Slam in New Orleans in June. This will be the first time OKC will attend this tournament. Your contribution will help us spend more time practicing our craft instead of fundraising so we can represent our city in the best possible way at this tournament.</strong></h3>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The money we are trying to raise will cover our fuel and hotel costs for the trip from OKC to New Orleans. A ten dollar contribution will get you a CD of poetry from all four members of the team. Fifteen dollars will get you a chapbook of poetry featuring all four team members plus members of our Red Dirt community. A twenty dollar contribution will get you the CD, chapbook, and photo of us. Fifty dollars will get you a swag bag with merch from each member of the team in the form of chapbooks and CD's. Seventy five dollars will get you everything mentioned above. If you donate one hundred dollars our very own Melissa May (ranked third in the nation at The Individual World Poetry Slam) will write you a poem on the topic of your choice or perform at a function of your choice. Three hundred dollars will get you a performance by the entire team at the event of your choice. Finally, a five hundred dollar donation will get you all of the things I mentioned above.</span></p>

The literary competition features preliminary bouts and culminates in the Southern Fried Poetry Slam Finals on Saturday, June 8th, 2013. In addition to the commemorative Moon Pies and RC Colas of Southern Fried tradition, this year's champions will receive over $7500 in cash and various prizes as well as a couple local merchant wears.<br/><br/>During the four-day event, poets will host free writing and performance workshops that are welcome to all throughout the community. There will also be special workshops designed for any young, aspiring writers who have any curiosity about becoming a spoken word artist. Outside of our traditional workshops we also provide opportunities for visiting poets to take part in community service in host city. While the Southern Fried Poetry Slam primarily highlights poets hailing from the South, it is also the second-largest poetry competition in the nation. This event is hosted by regional collectives that take pride in preserving its long-standing traditions while embarking on new ones. The 21th Annual Southern Fried Poetry Slam is proudly presented by The 2012 National Poetry Slam Champions, Slam New Orleans.</span></p>

WHAT?

Cholera India Pale Ale is an interactive art installation designed to highlight the inequality in living standards between the developed and developing world. Guests to an exclusive, annual London art event will be offered bottles of ultra-premium beer to drink. They will be clearly labelled as being made from ""cholera-laden"" water. It will be left up to them how they choose to react to the situation.

THE BACK STORY

I am a professional artist currently taking part in an MA in Fine Art at Central Saint Martins College of Art in London. My practice is influenced by political and human rights issues.

I had the idea for CHOLERA IPA while watching Youtube footage of the current situation in Haiti. By western standards the current Caribbean cholera epidemic is laughably simple to avoid. By the time water reaches boiling point, it's completely sterile. For us, avoiding cholera would be as easy as throwing the switch on a kettle.

So why has the disease killed thousands of Haitians in the last few months? Residents of the temporary camps and urban slums caused by the 2010 earthquake simply do not have access to electricity, fuel or any other way of heating their water. When I really started thinking about that which I take for granted and what it would mean to be utterly deprived of it, I felt moved to incorporate the subject into my artistic practice.

I wanted to create a work which reflected the absurdity of the situation. At the same time I want it to induce empathy, and lead us to question the values of our consumerist culture and what could be done with western resources given a slightly different frame of mind.

THE IMPACT

Being involved in the London art scene, I have chances to exhibit my work. However I want to take a more interactive approach and turn the audience into the exhibit. One of my roles at Central Saint Martins is sourcing beer sponsorship for exhibitions and events. For the next event (an art auction taking place in on July 8th) I will be offering CHOLERA IPA as the sponsored beer, rather than attracting the usual donations of Carlsberg, Becks, etc. I'm asking thousands of visitors to interact with the art directly by drinking it - thereby considering their relationship with the subject matter.

Sexual abuse is too often shamed, kept in the dark, and silenced. It's time to end that. 
In October of 2011, I created a photography project called Project Unbreakable. I began asking survivors of sexual assault to write a quote from their attacker on a poster. At first, it was just to show the world how incredibly common this issue is. But then I soon realized that it was a form of therapy for these survivors; they were finally able to let go of things that had held them down for weeks, months, years. I began receiving hundreds of emails from people asking to be apart of the project, either by photographing them or allowing their submission to be published on my blog. Sometimes people shared their stories with me - and sometimes, those stories were the first time they had ever told anyone. I am nineteen years old, and my career could end tomorrow, but I'd still feel fulfilled.

I want to take this project a step further. I want to be able to travel to different areas in America to photograph, to speak, to show my work - to show people that they are not alone. And maybe one day, I can turn this project into an organization, providing professional help for survivors, something that I am unfortunately not qualified to give. We all have the ability to change the world - it's just a matter of deciding how we want to. If you can donate, I would appreciate it. If you can't, please just share this page if you are willing. 

And if you are a survivor of sexual abuse, I want you to remember that you are unbreakable.-- In addition to the prizes listed to the right, musician Allie Moss is offering two half hour guitar lessons via Skype for 75 dollars each.

We
need to buy green building materials to get our trailer on the road by June
25th
We
are a multi-cultural troupe of musicians,
dancers, actors, hip-hop poets, puppeteers and visual artists  based in Southern California who want to
take our art where the spirit moves us. A 1951 trailer will be our home base.
We’ll roll into under-served communities, using art to help bring people
together.  The trailer is being
restored RIGHT NOW from the ground up. We need your help to turn it into green
place to live and showcase art.
Our
deadline is June 25th. That’s when we're hoping to
participate at the Watts Village Theater Company’s “Meet Me @Metro II.” The event is an opportunity for folks who use
public transportation to see mini-performances at Metro stops between the Watts
neighborhood and Long Beach.
 “Meet
Me @ Metro II” is our first event of the summer, but it won’t be our last. We
have lots more performances lined up. We'll
go into local communities in Southern California, performing at fairs, festivals
and museums. We'll show up at parks, barber shops and farmer's markets.  Our art explores a common theme:  the meaning of home, community and
identity.
The Pitch
Most of us
are graduates or students of California
Institute of the Arts. Like a touring band of performing gypsies, we will
bring everything we need with us – stage, lights, sound and seating.  We will stage exhibits, concerts, plays
and puppet shows.
We are going green! We will operate off-grid with solar-powered
equipment. That means we can go where the spirit takes us - in densely populated
urban areas or out in the desert.
We've already raised $20,000 - We've also received donated green
building materials, including equipment for our solar system.
Your donation can help us obtain:
(1.) A
window rebuild for puppet shows:
We want to re-engineer the front curved windows so that they will be able to
pop-out. That will extend our performance space, breaking down the physical
divide between the ""inside"" and the ""outside"" of the
trailer.
(2.) Solar
Power 
(3.) Energy-efficient lighting and sound equipment 
(4.) A
portable stage
(5.) Modular
furniture: a dinette booth used for poetry readings and art making. The
booth will transform into kid-size bleachers for indoor performances.
For all
this to happen we need to raise $12'000 by the time I graduate in May with an
MFA in acting from Cal Arts. Then we can work FULL TIME finishing up the
restoration by the end of June.
 
Short on cash?  Here are other ways to help:
1. Donate
your art, building materials or volunteer your home or art space for a
fundraising event - you could donate green building materials or donate

<p><img alt=""Lituanica birds effigy during the dusk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s16.postimg.org/yegmfsjn9/Lituanica_13.jpg"" dir=""ltr"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: bottom;"" title=""Lituanica birds""/></p>
<p><em> </em><em>Lituanica </em>is the name of a famed airplane that was piloted by two Lithuanian-American pilots Steponas Darius and Stasys Girėnas in 1933. The Lituanica birds’ installation pays tribute to these heroic pilots and their historic journey across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>80 years ago, Darius and Girėnas departed from Floyd Bennett Field airport (New York) with the intention of conducting a non-stop flight to Kaunas, Lithuania. Their aircraft was an orange Bellanca CH-300 Pacemaker called - <em>Lituanica</em> (meaning Lithuania in Latin).</p>
<p>The two pilots set out July 15, 1933 on their journey across the Atlantic Ocean, covering a distance of 3,984 miles (6,411 kilometers) without landing, in 37 hours and 11 minutes (107.1 mph). Despite having successfully crossed the Atlantic, the <em>Lituanica</em> crashed due to undetermined circumstances on July 17<sup>th</sup>, killing both pilots. In terms of comparison, as far as the distance of non-stop flights was concerned, their result ranked second only to that of Russell Boardman and John Polando, and ranked fourth in terms of flight duration at the time (source: Wikipedia). Despite the fact that Darius and Girėnas did not have navigational equipment and flew under unfavorable weather conditions, their flight was one of the most precise in aviation history. It equaled, and in some aspects surpassed, Charles Lindbergh's classic flight of 1927. Oddly enough, Lituanica is also noted for having carried the first transatlantic air mail consignment in history.</p>
<p>Today, <em>Lituanica</em> symbolizes deep cultural ties and a fond connection between the US and Lithuania. This orange colored airplane is a well-known icon and historic symbol of the two pilots’ heroic, but tragic flight.</p>
<p>We believe that these symbolic Lituanica birds will unite all flocks of burners making their way to the desert each year from their nests scattered in different parts of the world, joining these burner-birds empowered by a sense of community and the desire to fly freely.</p>
<p><img alt=""Lituanica birds dusk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s24.postimg.org/fl3jkq9rp/Lituanica_14.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Lituanica birds dusk""/></p>
<p>As a CORE project, we expect this merge of a well-known historical and cultural symbol to bring a deeper significance to our region. The symbolic gesture of honor via performance will be captured when setting the Lituanica birds ablaze. This unique and expressive symbol will inspire all burners flocking to the playa this year. </p>

 Lituanica is the name of a famed airplane that was piloted by two Lithuanian-American pilots Steponas Darius and Stasys Girėnas in 1933. The Lituanica birds’ installation pays tribute to these heroic pilots and their historic journey across the Atlantic.
80 years ago, Darius and Girėnas departed from Floyd Bennett Field airport (New York) with the intention of conducting a non-stop flight to Kaunas, Lithuania. Their aircraft was an orange Bellanca CH-300 Pacemaker called - Lituanica (meaning Lithuania in Latin).
The two pilots set out July 15, 1933 on their journey across the Atlantic Ocean, covering a distance of 3,984 miles (6,411 kilometers) without landing, in 37 hours and 11 minutes (107.1 mph). Despite having successfully crossed the Atlantic, the Lituanica crashed due to undetermined circumstances on July 17th, killing both pilots. In terms of comparison, as far as the distance of non-stop flights was concerned, their result ranked second only to that of Russell Boardman and John Polando, and ranked fourth in terms of flight duration at the time (source: Wikipedia). Despite the fact that Darius and Girėnas did not have navigational equipment and flew under unfavorable weather conditions, their flight was one of the most precise in aviation history. It equaled, and in some aspects surpassed, Charles Lindbergh's classic flight of 1927. Oddly enough, Lituanica is also noted for having carried the first transatlantic air mail consignment in history.
Today, Lituanica symbolizes deep cultural ties and a fond connection between the US and Lithuania. This orange colored airplane is a well-known icon and historic symbol of the two pilots’ heroic, but tragic flight.
We believe that these symbolic Lituanica birds will unite all flocks of burners making their way to the desert each year from their nests scattered in different parts of the world, joining these burner-birds empowered by a sense of community and the desire to fly freely.

As a CORE project, we expect this merge of a well-known historical and cultural symbol to bring a deeper significance to our region. The symbolic gesture of honor via performance will be captured when setting the Lituanica birds ablaze. This unique and expressive symbol will inspire all burners flocking to the playa this year. 
The dimensions of the sculpture are: 20 feet high (6 meters) and 20 feet wide.",12.0,0,"9 Campaigns

<p><strong>After more than thirteen years of Glassblowing &amp; Music I am beyond ready to turn my passions into a living. Just need to get over the first speedbump </strong></p>
<p><strong>I live in Abq NM. I am currently trying to purchase the house I've lived in for my whole life,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I work in a garage at my house where I built my Glassblowing &amp; Art studio. I love my shop works GREAT for me. I get to work at home and therefore am able to spend more time with my family, my ol'lady, Angella"" and my dog 'Kupa'. :) It's nice to have that option. I'm currently working on building a website to sell my glass work and other items such as paintings, woodwork, and my music ect!  </strong><strong>                                                                                                          </strong></p>
<p><strong>My mom (who is also my landlord)has been renting the house to us for i dont know how long? but a long long time!  Recently she informed me  due to financial difficulties she must sell the house or else it's going to be FORCLOSED and takin by the bank :( </strong>              </p>
<p><strong>I have been desperately trying to come up with a downpayment so can keep doing the things we love. </strong></p>
<p> I've decided if we can just get back to ZERO,and outta the red. we would be fine. just need a little help getting there with no time thats a lot to ask i know.I really wish it was not such short notice im sure we could work it out if we had more time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong> If we could make it to $1000! we could pay off the bills and be ok.    </strong></h2>
<p><strong>Im sure i can manage that with a lot of hard work.<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://a1.ec-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/153/a0985d823de4418eae64561cd6ecf692/l.png"" src="""" style=""""/> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://a1.ec-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/139/d860ef2d418949d29c8a042819acd5fa/l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>

<p>I have been workin like crazy, It's been kina rough lately, but my motto is, Whatever it takes to keep youre dreams alive!</p>
<p>My definition of dream's is love and passion. When your so passionate about  somthing &amp; you Love so so much you find a way to make it possible.The things that are in your way seem to fade away, you do whatever it take's to make it happen, No matter the task how big or small if the prize is Love &amp; Passion, you will conquer all!

<p>So thats where I'm at now....I do not want to lose my house that I've lived in since I was a wee lil' midget....I've worked too hard to get to where I am &amp; it would be devastating to myself, my sanity and my business!</p>
<p><strong>I look at this as a huge opportunity for me to own my own house and move foward with my glassblowng business, my music, and financial stability.  </strong></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
THANK YOU for visiting our campaign, we truly appreciate your support in helping us achieve our hopes, goals, & dreams.  As a good friend of mine would say...                           ..NAMASTE... 
My name is Zachary D. Morgan & this is my lady Angella Gyure.
 
               *                                                 
Zac, 
                                          My
                                      PASSIONS
                               Glassblowing & Music.           
                             *                              *
After more than thirteen years of Glassblowing & Music I am beyond ready to turn my passions into a living. Just need to get over the first speedbump 
I live in Abq NM. I am currently trying to purchase the house I've lived in for my whole life,
I work in a garage at my house where I built my Glassblowing & Art studio. I love my shop works GREAT for me. I get to work at home and therefore am able to spend more time with my family, my ol'lady, Angella"" and my dog 'Kupa'. :) It's nice to have that option. I'm currently working on building a website to sell my glass work and other items such as paintings, woodwork, and my music ect!                                                                                                            
My mom (who is also my landlord)has been renting the house to us for i dont know how long? but a long long time!  Recently she informed me  due to financial difficulties she must sell the house or else it's going to be FORCLOSED and takin by the bank :(               
I have been desperately trying to come up with a downpayment so can keep doing the things we love. 
 I've decided if we can just get back to ZERO,and outta the red. we would be fine. just need a little help getting there with no time thats a lot to ask i know.I really wish it was not such short notice im sure we could work it out if we had more time.
 
 If we could make it to $1000! we could pay off the bills and be ok.    
Im sure i can manage that with a lot of hard work. 
 
 
                                                *
 
I have been workin like crazy, It's been kina rough lately, but my motto is, Whatever it takes to keep youre dreams alive!
My definition of dream's is love and passion. When your so passionate about  somthing & you Love so so much you find a way to make it possible.The things that are in your way seem to fade away, you do whatever it take's to make it happen, No matter the task how big or small if the prize is Love & Passion, you will conquer all! ""ZR""
Whats life without Love & Passion?    
 
So thats where I'm at now....I do not want to lose my house that I've lived in since I was a wee lil' midget....I've worked too hard to get to where I am & it would be devastating to myself, my sanity and my business!
I look at this as a huge opportunity for me to own my own house and move foward with my glassblowng business, my music, and financial stability.  
I'm definately a creative person & I do believe anything is possible, especially when the right people are on your side! 
What do you think? do you believe? can we do this?
If you believe, I want you on my side!! you must be the optimist like me:)
So lets do it!

The Impact
The impact from our campaign will allow us to own our home & keep doing all the things we love & are passionate about. It will allow me to expand my business. I would be able to increase the size of my studio invest in more equipment & start TEACHING glass lessons!
I will be able to produce and record my own music!, and would love to produce anyone else who wants to be recorded but does'nt have the kinda money it takes to pay for studio time! produce albums and share my passion for glass,music,etc. with the world.
Most of all we will be taking the burden off my mom's shoulders by taking over the house and payments.
 I hope to bring smiles and warm fuzzy feelings to my students, listeners, friends, and family....inspire and motivate people, share my intrests and passion. I hope to create beautiful and amazing art and music, while having fun and enjoying each & every accomplishment.
 
 Any amount will help! Even if you cant donate money...just posting and sharing this link with everyone you know would help a ton and be much appreciated. Thank you!
We want all contributors/supporters to know we greatly appreciate your help and kindness!!! It means more than you could possibly know.
Whether we succeed or not, we still thank you for your time, support, and donations to help myself, my mom, my girlfriend and my pup Kupa!:) woof!
 We thank you all from the bottom of our hearts.
Zachary D. Morgan,  Angella Gyure, and Koop doggie!
 
 I'd like to thank  MR. Miro for the inspiration!!!  ""NAMASTE""
 

MORE ABOUT ME.....
Another passion of mine that will also be possible if I/we accomplish this overwhelming task is production of music mine aswell as others.
I love everything about music recording,mixing,mastering,live sound,making and editing music videos are all things i love and enjoy doing.
I play guitar,piano,drums,bass & vocals....I also make my own beats/loops :) I pretty much love anything that has to do with art & music! I play/record in my living room with a tascam digital 8 track. I've been recording and going through all my original songs that have accumulated over the years so i can finally complete my album:)
I have more than enough original music for two albums but one thing at a time right. Have to make sure I have the house situation under control first before I delve into another task.
I love glassblowing making music! these things are my life! and ive learned alot about them but more about myself from these things. I wouldn't know what to do if I couldn't do the things I love & share them with the world :)

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Sounds of Iceland project</span><br/>
</h3><p></p><p>The last ten years or so we have been recording various sounds from Icelandic nature. Many of these sounds are similar to those one could find in many countries around the world. However, there are some sounds - or rather sound environments -that may define Icelandic nature more than others, and these are the sounds we are interested in allowing others to experience. These are sounds of glaciers, geothermal activity, Icelandic bird life in tundra and then radio waves recordings of northern lights. </p><p>Since the actual recordings of
the nature sounds are already done - the funds needed are only to make these sounds available to others - CD's and a proper website.</p>
<p>The
aim is to start with a sort of ""best of"" disk with good examples - have some 1000 CD's and a website made. This should be enough to get
this project going and allow us to publish more recorded material as well as keep on recording more nature sounds and
publish as they become available, </p><p></p><p>Below are descriptions of
selected soundscapes we captured and intend to make available on the first CD.  The description of each track is just like it will be on the CD.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">1.</span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Glacier: Sólheimajökull</b><br/></p>
<p>Sólheimajökull
is a glacier tounge that extends from Mýrdalsjökull , the glacier that holds
one of the most feracious volcanos in the world, Katla. As you listen notice a
slight but constant low to low-mid frequency rumble throughout the whole
recording – this is not the wind but probably the sound of the glacier crawling
onwards. Near the beginning there is more low frequency content due to
large chunks of ice falling into the river at the side of the glacier. Also,
notice around minute 6:20 - in the distance you can hear a large chunk of ice
breaking from the glacier and falling into the river at the side of the
glacier. Perhaps the most peculiar sound in this recording is an unexplained
sort of punch at around minute 10:09 – and just a second before it there is a
slight electric disturbance. This is not human made because at the time of the
recording there were only five people on the glacier and all of these people
were very far away. Furthermore, there is nothing situated this close to the
microphone that could have made this sound – so, there is really no
explanation. If you can think of some explanation then please let us know. This
recording was conducted some time mid summer after midnight 2011.</p>
<p>2.<b>Glacier: Svínafellsjökull </b></p>
<p>Svínafellsjökull
is a glacier tounge that extends from Vatnajökull, the largest glacier in
Europe. The Svínafellsjökull area has been used for films such as Batman Begins
and Game of Thrones and is known to shine spectacular blue colours. When
listening carefully to this recording one should easily notice the vast number
of different sounds. Underneath there is a faint rumble that varies throughout
the recording but there are no big surprises and the multitude of gentle sounds
compose a spectacular piece of art. Like the recording at Sólheimajökull, this
recording was conducted on a beautiful night in the summer of 2011.</p>
<p>3. <b>Geothermal: Krýsuvík </b></p>
<p>There
are quite a few places in Iceland with geothermal activity. Krýsuvík is one of
these areas, on the Reykjanes peninsula, situated in the middle of the fissure
zone on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It has several geothermal fields, such as mud
pots, hot springs, solfataras and fumaroles. Because of the different types,
the sounds are also different but constant. The recording was conducted between
six and seven in the afternoon sometime in the spring of 2013.</p>
<p>4. <b>Tundra: Skorradalur </b></p>
<p>Iceland
almost totally lacks any proper woodland but instead has areas covered with all
kinds of tough vegetation that cover the land in large areas - and colors the
land beautifully during the summer months. One such area is Skorradalur which
is about an hour drive north from the capital of Reykjavik. This recording is
quite diverse, having different kinds of birds, some different intensity of
rain, and a babbling brook in the distance. The recording was done on a wet
night in the middle of summer 2005.</p>
<p>5. <b>Tundra: Úlfljótsvatn </b></p>
<p>Another
example of Iceland tundra is this very lively recording made on a small
mountain near Lake Úlfljótsvatn – around an hour drive east from Reykjavik. The
main actors in this recording are the birds, but the area has a large bird
population. The recording was done on a quiet night early summer 2004.</p>
<p>6. <b>Aurora Borealis/Northern lights: outside Reykjavik</b></p>
<p>In
winter time one can often see beautiful northern lights in the sky above all
over Iceland. However, few people know that these magnificent things also make
some interesting sounds that can be captured with specially made equipment. The
sound is alien as well as a bit haunting. These recordings were captured just
outside Reykjavik early winter 2014.</p><p></p><p><br/></p></div>","The Sounds of Iceland project

publish as they become available, Below are descriptions of
selected soundscapes we captured and intend to make available on the first CD.  The description of each track is just like it will be on the CD.1.Glacier: Sólheimajökull
Sólheimajökull
is a glacier tounge that extends from Mýrdalsjökull , the glacier that holds
one of the most feracious volcanos in the world, Katla. As you listen notice a
slight but constant low to low-mid frequency rumble throughout the whole
recording – this is not the wind but probably the sound of the glacier crawling
onwards. Near the beginning there is more low frequency content due to
large chunks of ice falling into the river at the side of the glacier. Also,
notice around minute 6:20 - in the distance you can hear a large chunk of ice
breaking from the glacier and falling into the river at the side of the
glacier. Perhaps the most peculiar sound in this recording is an unexplained
sort of punch at around minute 10:09 – and just a second before it there is a
slight electric disturbance. This is not human made because at the time of the
recording there were only five people on the glacier and all of these people
were very far away. Furthermore, there is nothing situated this close to the
microphone that could have made this sound – so, there is really no
explanation. If you can think of some explanation then please let us know. This
recording was conducted some time mid summer after midnight 2011.
2.Glacier: Svínafellsjökull 
Svínafellsjökull
is a glacier tounge that extends from Vatnajökull, the largest glacier in
Europe. The Svínafellsjökull area has been used for films such as Batman Begins
and Game of Thrones and is known to shine spectacular blue colours. When
listening carefully to this recording one should easily notice the vast number
of different sounds. Underneath there is a faint rumble that varies throughout
the recording but there are no big surprises and the multitude of gentle sounds
compose a spectacular piece of art. Like the recording at Sólheimajökull, this
recording was conducted on a beautiful night in the summer of 2011.
3. Geothermal: Krýsuvík 
There
are quite a few places in Iceland with geothermal activity. Krýsuvík is one of
these areas, on the Reykjanes peninsula, situated in the middle of the fissure
zone on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It has several geothermal fields, such as mud
pots, hot springs, solfataras and fumaroles. Because of the different types,
the sounds are also different but constant. The recording was conducted between
six and seven in the afternoon sometime in the spring of 2013.
4. Tundra: Skorradalur 
Iceland
almost totally lacks any proper woodland but instead has areas covered with all
kinds of tough vegetation that cover the land in large areas - and colors the
land beautifully during the summer months. One such area is Skorradalur which
is about an hour drive north from the capital of Reykjavik. This recording is
quite diverse, having different kinds of birds, some different intensity of
rain, and a babbling brook in the distance. The recording was done on a wet
night in the middle of summer 2005.
5. Tundra: Úlfljótsvatn 
Another
example of Iceland tundra is this very lively recording made on a small
mountain near Lake Úlfljótsvatn – around an hour drive east from Reykjavik. The
main actors in this recording are the birds, but the area has a large bird
population. The recording was done on a quiet night early summer 2004.
6. Aurora Borealis/Northern lights: outside Reykjavik
In
winter time one can often see beautiful northern lights in the sky above all
over Iceland. However, few people know that these magnificent things also make
some interesting sounds that can be captured with specially made equipment. The
sound is alien as well as a bit haunting. These recordings were captured just
outside Reykjavik early winter 2014.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p>I follow a
cyclical–reciprocal model of teach and learn, mentor and be mentored, using art
as a medium of self-interrogation and expression while mirroring the society
around me. I believe that artists are responsible for honouring the sacred in
our present-day societies. People, our livelihoods, our planet, our cosmos, and
beyond are sacred. I feel that if the work we create is truly for the people
then we can’t avoid asking questions about our present state of being
(globally, nationally, locally, personally). </p><p>

Like a storyteller sitting under a tree, at the centre of the village, telling stories to the community gathered, the practitioner’s re-positioning urges them to become both accountable and responsible (able to account for and respond to) their communities. Participants of the residency create works of art catalyzed by their biographical experiences during the course of the residency.</span><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>we are the stories we have been told, the stories we believe and the stories we retell</i></h3><p><i><br/></i></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>The goal we have set for the project is $18,000 to cover everything related to organizing, interviewing, designing, photographing, and printing the FACES OF YEMOYA book.</p><ul>

- Che Kothari, Photographer/Artist-Activist/Instigator YEMOYA INDIA 2012

in order to cultivate a healing tree in the world, I must first nurture its roots in my soulwho am I and what is YEMOYAMy name is d'bi.young anitafrika and I am an Afrikan-Jamaican-Canadian dubpoet, monodramatist and educator who is passionate about people, self-actualization, storytelling and mentorship. In 2008 I founded an international artist residency named YEMOYA, in an attempt to combine all my passions. 7 years later, I have mentored over 50 artists globally through the residency. Let's celebrate them together by publishing a hard cover photo book featuring these global artists soon to become world leaders!
I follow a
cyclical–reciprocal model of teach and learn, mentor and be mentored, using art
as a medium of self-interrogation and expression while mirroring the society
around me. I believe that artists are responsible for honouring the sacred in
our present-day societies. People, our livelihoods, our planet, our cosmos, and
beyond are sacred. I feel that if the work we create is truly for the people
then we can’t avoid asking questions about our present state of being
(globally, nationally, locally, personally). 
If you had known me and also known yourself, you would not have killed me. - Geordie Trifa, Filmmaker/HipHop Artist YEMOYA Jamaica 2013YEMOYA is a three week international artist residency, that combines trans-disciplinary arts training with wellness practices for the (w)holistic development of people. Founded in summer 2008 in toronto canada, YEMOYA’s intensive twenty-one day program focuses on the creative, physical, mental, emotional and spiritual growth and development of its resident artists, using the Sorplusi Method. YEMOYA alumni include international artists such as Ngozi Paul, Kemba King, Titilope Sonuga, Jamilah Malika, Ria Hartley, Che Kothari, Bahia Watson, Mriga Kapadiya, LInda Kaoma, Amanda Parris, Adiyana Morris, Liza Paul, Julene Robinson, Raphael Cohen, Lishai Peel, Colanthony Humphreys, Kalmplex, Erin Bosenberg, Webster McDonald and Geordie Gescha. Residencies have been hosted in Canada, England, South Africa, Belize, Jamaica and The Bahamas with artists from additional countries such as Zimbabwe, Nigeria and America.Photos by Wade Hudsonlisten to your art and in turn you will learn to listen to yourselfWhat Is The Project FACES of YEMOYAWorking alongside the phenomenal Jamaican-Canadian photographer Wade Hudson, we would like to photograph the alumni artists of YEMOYA, interview them about their life and art since completing the residency, and choose an excerpt from what they created during the program; all to be featured in The Faces of YEMOYA hard cover book with each artist's full profile.Why is the Faces of YEMOYA photo book importantThese are the change-makers of the world. Supporting their growth and development through the YEMOYA program and the YEMOYA book gives us an opportunity to witness what happens to a seed when we water it and give it love constantly; it grows in(to) a dynamic forest that serves us all. This book is also a way to connect artists globally and foster communication across borders and cultures. It will serve as an inspiration to emerging artists worldwide who are able to connect with the artists and their profiles presented in the book; a living reflection of themselves and their potential.
The sorplusi method helped me to break down my preconceived notions that ‘real’ artists somehow exist on a plane different from the rest of us. It taught me that as long as I stay true to what is in my heart, my stories are worth sharing. - Liza Paul, Playwright/Actor/Producer YEMOYA India 2012The Sorplusi Method - a YEMOYA FrameworkThe Sorplusi Methodology is a framework for 1) self-actualization 2) artistic creation and 3) public engagement towards community mobilization, that (a) focuses on the holistic development of the practitioner in the process of self-discovery & recovery, before, during, and after rigorous self-exploration; (b) helps the practitioner to identify their personal and professional integrities in art creation and dissemination (c) equips the practitioner with the tools to mentor others in their development towards the development of community. Based on seminal work of pioneer dubpoet Anita Stewart (d’bi’s mother), these ideas form a comprehensive eco-system of accountability and responsibility between the practitioner and their communities.I must find peace within to mirror peace in the outsideThere are eight guiding principles in the method: Self-knowledge, Orality, Rhythm, Political Content and Context, Language, Urgency, Sacredness and Integrity. These are balanced by and explored through the practitioner’s five bodies: the physical, emotional, mental, creative and spiritual. Each principle challenges us to live to our deepest integrities; to not only be self-invested but to (re)position to the centre of our micro and macro communities. Like a storyteller sitting under a tree, at the centre of the village, telling stories to the community gathered, the practitioner’s re-positioning urges them to become both accountable and responsible (able to account for and respond to) their communities. Participants of the residency create works of art catalyzed by their biographical experiences during the course of the residency.we are the stories we have been told, the stories we believe and the stories we retellWhat We Need & What You GetThe goal we have set for the project is $18,000 to cover everything related to organizing, interviewing, designing, photographing, and printing the FACES OF YEMOYA book.
Photo studio $3000
Book design $1500
Cover & Dust Jacket $1000
Administrative costs $2000
Printing Costs 200 hard cover copies $5000
Transportation costs $500
You can help us achieve our goal. For your loving contribution, there are some wonderful perks that are available to you that range from products to workshops to performances and even guest spots in the upcoming YEMOYA international artist residency taking place in Hawaii in August!If we don't reach our entire goal, we will STILL publish a book, adjusting our aims to match the funding we receive.r/evolution is love
Lyrics and prose I write are grounded in politicized messages, identity-based experience, and that which I call my truth.
- Jamilah Malika, Writer/Performer/Teacher YEMOYA Canada 2010The ImpactThere is ONE message that all the artists who have participated in the YEMOYA international residency have and that message is LOVE! Through the art that they create they spread love on the planet!

Maybe. I’m not sure how well this would work on a tshirt. Let me know if 
you’re interested and I’ll look into it. I choose to only print t-shirts
 on organic cotton and in sizes that fit a wide range of body shapes. I have a print/ship vendor for this, though I’m afraid they’re 
not cheap. If you know other print-on-demand/they-handle-the-shipping tshirt vendors that offer t-shirts that fit 
those criteria (including fitted/”women’s” shirts in larger sizes) then 
please let me know.  I’m not able to look into other 
printing/distribution options (eg.organising a screenprinting run) at
 this stage.Can you print this on X item?If it has a reasonably smooth surface, then probably.  If it has a textured surface (even as textured as cloth), then that's much harder. Talk to me and we can see if we can figure something out.

It is based on illustrations I created, you could call them monster-creatures. I began working on this project in August 2013, researching the wonderful worlds of nomadic lifestyles &amp; the use of tents as a way of life, that interested me and their diverse visual-textile language. They are all my original works and are to be printed on high quality fabrics. This campaign is the most significant thing in my life right now and is to be my debut collection after 4 years of studies. In designing this body of work I used different techniques such as watercolors, felt pens, pastel &amp; gouache colors, paper cuts and finally scanning it all through a scanner to be digitally printed in the highest quality.</p><p>When printing textile designs, one tries to get as close as possible to the colors of the original work. In my school workshop I can print using silkscreens. However, after trying this out the results didn’t satisfy me. I had lost many colors and effects in the process. In this case the original colors are near impossible to achieve with anything other than high quality digital print. By contributing to my project you allow me to use the facilities of the highly renowned Glasgow based digital printing studio in Scotland named the “Centre for Advanced Textiles”. I have invested in this project my own savings so far, as well as the time and work for the year, including making first test prints in Scotland that yielded great results. The significant part of my remaining expenses in order to finish the project are however, too high for me to be able to complete alone.  And that is why I need your help. I need to cover the costs of scanning &amp; printing all my designs in Glasgow, and even without me being there that is the core expense. In order to be able to overlook the process and insure my work is being printed correctly, I would want to be present as the work is done, this is a smaller expense yet still one I need help with.  </p><br/><p>The scanning &amp; printing costs:</p><br/><ul>
<li><p>Scanning - 250 Euro</p></li>
<li><p>Printing 13 Meter fabric - 750 Euro</p></li>
<li><p>13 meter of Fabric - 400 Euro</p></li>

Growing up in the countryside between Germany and France influenced me as a designer in my work today in Israel. This collection you are about to contribute to is my graduation project as a BA in design. It is based on illustrations I created, you could call them monster-creatures. I began working on this project in August 2013, researching the wonderful worlds of nomadic lifestyles & the use of tents as a way of life, that interested me and their diverse visual-textile language. They are all my original works and are to be printed on high quality fabrics. This campaign is the most significant thing in my life right now and is to be my debut collection after 4 years of studies. In designing this body of work I used different techniques such as watercolors, felt pens, pastel & gouache colors, paper cuts and finally scanning it all through a scanner to be digitally printed in the highest quality.When printing textile designs, one tries to get as close as possible to the colors of the original work. In my school workshop I can print using silkscreens. However, after trying this out the results didn’t satisfy me. I had lost many colors and effects in the process. In this case the original colors are near impossible to achieve with anything other than high quality digital print. By contributing to my project you allow me to use the facilities of the highly renowned Glasgow based digital printing studio in Scotland named the “Centre for Advanced Textiles”. I have invested in this project my own savings so far, as well as the time and work for the year, including making first test prints in Scotland that yielded great results. The significant part of my remaining expenses in order to finish the project are however, too high for me to be able to complete alone.  And that is why I need your help. I need to cover the costs of scanning & printing all my designs in Glasgow, and even without me being there that is the core expense. In order to be able to overlook the process and insure my work is being printed correctly, I would want to be present as the work is done, this is a smaller expense yet still one I need help with.  The scanning & printing costs:
Scanning - 250 Euro
Printing 13 Meter fabric - 750 Euro
13 meter of Fabric - 400 Euro
What you get for contributing to my campaign:
For the ‘small yet helpful’ contribution of 5 Euro - You get a designed digital postcard sent to you in a personal email from me.
For the ‘1st stage hero’ contribution of 10 Euro -  You get a real life printed ‘thank you’ post card sent to your address. That’s a keeper you can pin-up on the wall!
For the ‘2nd stage hero’ contribution of 15 Euro - You get a set of 5 real life printed postcards sent to your address. That’s a keeper you can pin-up or send to other friends too!                                For the ‘we’re getting serious’ contribution of 20 Euro - You get to choose between       1) A ‘Tote bag’ with a designed print from my collection for those shopping                                     trips or daily urban adventures.       2) A tea towel designed with an original print from my collection                                                         for hosting important tea guests.  For the ‘this is great!’ contribution of 30 Euro - You get a set of 2 tea towels with prints from my collection. No tea host can really do without them.   For the ‘like a pro’ contribution of 40 Euro - You get a unique T-shirt printed with my design from the collection.             For the ‘sweet dreams are made of these’ contribution of 55 Euro - You get 1 designed pillow case with prints from my collection, sized 50x50 Centimeters. So you can sleep in style.               For the ‘it takes 2 to tango’ contribution of 90 Euro - You get a set of 2 designed pillow cases with prints from my collection, sized 50x50 Centimeters and 40x40 Centimeters. So you can sleep in style twice, or with a partner.  For the ‘angel in disguise’ contribution of 200 Euro - I will design for you, your own personalized monster per your request of color, mood and animal style that you like. This will be printed on the item of your choice from the list above.If I do not reach the full goal of 1300 Euro I will still do everything in my power and capabilities to bring this collection to reality, however it won’t be easy with no further funding, so I hope you can help a little.I truly believe design makes an impact in our daily lives. I hope to be able to make our lives a little bit more pleasant to the eye with my designs to be used in fashion, interior design and brighten our daily experiences.  Hopefully, this project will reach many in the design and fashion world. As a final project it will help me make my first steps in this path. You can be a part of making this come to be.Other Ways You Can HelpI know that some of you really want to help, but just can’t contribute right now. As a struggling student I understand, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:

</div></div>","Active Rest has been selected for the Market Street Prototyping Festival (MSPF); an event sponsored by Yerba Buena Center of the Arts and the City of San Francisco. The goal is to create a more vibrant and positive experience on Market St. Read more about MSPF here. April 8-11, 50 prototypes will be erected downtown San Francisco along Market Street. 



Our Design


Active Rest came from a desire to combine our love of climbing with design. Really,  Active Rest can be many things:




It's a campusing  board
It's a bus stop
It's a meting place
It's a soap box
It's a place of meditation
the list goes on. 





The project was inspired by campusing (a training tool for rock climbers).It requires no extra equipment. It's something that can be done in a matter of seconds, or you could spend some time climbing around.  


Campusing boards are typically made of plywood. As an homage to both the campusing board and San Francisco's long history of wood construction, we chose 1/2"" plywood as our primary building material.

so we wondered:
what if this?


Looked like this?







Who are we?We are the Woodshed Collaborative. We're a group of designers, architects, structural engineers, and educators developing experimental art, architecture, and urban propositions as a means to hone in our craft outside of other professional obligations.



We are using this project as a great learning opportunity for Academy of Art Students. 



From concept design to physical assembly, students get a real life start to finish experience in creating an architectural piece.  

But we have also been working with engineers from Arup and Livermore Architecture & Engineering, Inc to make sure that the project works.






Your Support

With that said, we need help in purchasing materials. Between plywood, steel rods and transportation, we are looking to raise $5,000. Your donation would help us purchase the (pounds) of plywood needed. We have brainstormed some pretty cool donation perks and are very excited to get started with milling and assembling Active Rest!

It is necessary to us that the exhibit be free and open to the public, but this means that we have virtually no sources of revenue to help cover the many and diverse project costs of planning and hosting this exhibit. These costs include stipends for these accomplished artists, fabrication of the exhibit walls, displays, and literature, the production of the exhibit catalogue so that the impact of the experience can extend beyond the duration of the exhibit itself, hosting a catered, traditional Lakota foods event one of the evenings during the exhibit, and producing exhibit T-shirts and posters, in addition to the significant operational costs of CAIRNS in planning and executing this exhibit.</span></h3>

<p></p>
<p>We are hosting a FREE exhibit that focuses entirely on the short Lakota emergence narrative titled, ""How the Lakota Came Upon the World,"" published in 1917. The exhibit divides the 1,251-word narrative into 16 ""passages.""</p>
</div>
<p>What will it include? What can I expect to see?</p>
<p>-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—</p>
<p>HISTORIC OBJECTS: Each passage from the narrative pairs with an outstanding example of a practical or artistic object. The selected objects span a period of time from before the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty all the way to the early 1970s. All were created by Lakotas and were collected from within the boundaries of the 1868 Treaty lands, including what is now Pine Ridge, Rosebud, Standing Rock, and Cheyenne River Reservations, as well as the community of Rapid City.</p>
<br/><p>ORIGINAL ARTWORK: In addition to the passages and objects, original artworks by distinguished and emerging contemporary Lakota artists will be featured, thereby creating what we are calling 'vignettes.' These 16 vignettes will thus recount the Lakota emergence narrative in written words, museum collections and contemporary artworks, illustrating that the emergence narrative continues to be a source of creativity, and that Wind Cave was and always will remain a landscape of special significance in Lakota cosmology.</p>

The Center for American Indian Research and Native Studies (CAIRNS) is an Indian-controlled nonprofit research and education center located in Pine Ridge Reservation. Since our beginning in 2004, we've stuck to our commitment of advancing knowledge and understanding of American Indian communities and issues important to them. We believe in the assets that are here in tribal communities, and are proud to present a project that celebrates the many strengths of Lakotas historically and today. Thank you very much for considering supporting this exhibit! Wopila Tanka!


What You Will Help Us Achieve

In contributing to this project, you will:



Help us bring a fundamental piece of Lakota history to the forefront of knowledge and understanding about Lakotas and Lakota communities.

Make it possible for us to present this critical narrative in a good way, with the reverence it deserves.

Amplify the voices of incredible Lakota men and women artists as they creatively respond to the narrative.


Make an incredible, formative experience available to young students in area school districts who will visit this exhibit and who are studying this narrative.


Broaden the dialogue between Native and non-Native community members in the Black Hills region of South Dakota, a place characterized by a tense history and persistent friction between these groups.


Support the self-determination of Lakotas and Lakota nations who, through this exhibit, are affirming, celebrating, and sharing their heritage.







   What We Need & What You Get
We are asking for $8,000 in support from you to help see this project through. So far, this amazing project has only been possible through the generous and committed volunteer work of its organizers, our institutional partners, and our sixteen participating artists. It is necessary to us that the exhibit be free and open to the public, but this means that we have virtually no sources of revenue to help cover the many and diverse project costs of planning and hosting this exhibit. These costs include stipends for these accomplished artists, fabrication of the exhibit walls, displays, and literature, the production of the exhibit catalogue so that the impact of the experience can extend beyond the duration of the exhibit itself, hosting a catered, traditional Lakota foods event one of the evenings during the exhibit, and producing exhibit T-shirts and posters, in addition to the significant operational costs of CAIRNS in planning and executing this exhibit.

Your support will provide you the unique satisfaction of knowing you are part of a movement that is advancing knowledge and understanding of Lakota communities. Beyond this incredible collaboration alone, however, we have determined a number of ways of giving you a tangible sense of our appreciation. Our perks include a variety of CAIRNS educational products, different levels of sponsorship acknowledgment both online and in our printed exhibit catalogue, signed prints of the original artworks, and even several experiential opportunities, including a retreat to Wingsprings in the heart of Lakota lands and a tour of Wind Cave, the place of Lakota Emergence. See our campaign’s “Perks” on the right hand side of the page for more information.


   The Exhibit

We are hosting a FREE exhibit that focuses entirely on the short Lakota emergence narrative titled, ""How the Lakota Came Upon the World,"" published in 1917. The exhibit divides the 1,251-word narrative into 16 ""passages.""

What will it include? What can I expect to see?
-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—
HISTORIC OBJECTS: Each passage from the narrative pairs with an outstanding example of a practical or artistic object. The selected objects span a period of time from before the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty all the way to the early 1970s. All were created by Lakotas and were collected from within the boundaries of the 1868 Treaty lands, including what is now Pine Ridge, Rosebud, Standing Rock, and Cheyenne River Reservations, as well as the community of Rapid City.
ORIGINAL ARTWORK: In addition to the passages and objects, original artworks by distinguished and emerging contemporary Lakota artists will be featured, thereby creating what we are calling 'vignettes.' These 16 vignettes will thus recount the Lakota emergence narrative in written words, museum collections and contemporary artworks, illustrating that the emergence narrative continues to be a source of creativity, and that Wind Cave was and always will remain a landscape of special significance in Lakota cosmology.
What else is happening in conjunction with the exhibit?
-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—
STUDENT ART SHOW: Just around the corner from the Lakota Emergence exhibit,  at the Performing Arts Center, there will be an exhibition of Rapid City high school students' artwork, responding to the same sixteen passages of the emergence narrative.

</div><p><b></b></p><p><b>Ch!ps</b></p>
<p>Wha gwan internet? This is Infinite Livez hitting you up with the latest news regarding my first ever fund raiser. As you may know I am responsible for several recordings made for the likes of Ninja Tune and Big Dada and over the years have made a name for myself as an artist that likes to push the limits of Hip Hop music. Some of you may also know that I am also a visual artist and have produced work in a wide range of media including prints, comics and animations. Well after a long stint in the world of sound I am finally ready to immerse myself in a project that highlights my visual skills as much as my musical ones. And that is where Ch!ps comes in. Ch!ps will be a combined audio and visual release. Essentially it will be a 36 page artist book (limited to a run of 500 copies) that will also include a free downloadable LP of my latest recordings. The book will consist of illustrations and collages influenced by Surrealism,  Anime and Gothic Futurism. Whilst the music will follow my latest endeavours into the world of Left Field Hip Hop underpinning the trademark sound that I have become known for.</p>
<p>Funding me in this will not only help produce a great piece of art but will help contribute to a project aiming to put a new lease of life into the idea that the ""hardcopy"" still has relevance today. As many of you know it has been increasingly difficult for a musician to sell physical products based on the music alone (hence a book combined a with a recording).  So if you have been down with what I have done so far  and would like to see more by the way of cutting edge material then don't hesitate to get behind me on this.</p>
<p><b>So I need...</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>I estimate that I will need around </p>
<p>500 euros to print the book</p>
<p>450 euros to master the recordings</p>
<p>450 euro to cover labour production cost</p>
<p>For perks I will offer ink drawings, prints, recorded vocals, animations and the all important pre orders on copies of Ch!ps.</p>
<p><b>But…!!</b></p>
<p>If I do not reach my target I will cover the outstanding cost myself and use what was contributed none the less to the completion of the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Result</b></p>
<p>As mentioned I am mainly known for my music but for some years have been itching to find a way to open up my audience to the visual aspects of what I do  and feel this would be a fantastic project by which to do so. Anyone doubting my ability to realize this project only need look at the long collection of recordings that I have produced over my career for some of the most cutting edge labels in the world of  hip hop, jazz and electronica.  </p>
<p><b>Glitches and Obstacles </b></p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be a risk trying to open up fans to seeing a different side of what I do, hence my aim is to make a combined audio/visual project, so as not to alienate  any existing fans.</p>

<i>¿Por que necesito tu ayuda?</i>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Desde 2007 llevo experimentando y buscando la forma más <i>fidedigna, </i><i>pero</i><i> personal
</i>de representar estos tesoros en piedra. Hasta ahora siempre he invertido
mis propios recursos en tiempo y dinero, y por eso el desarrollo de esta idea
se ha ralentizado mucho.  Hay que tener en cuenta que, estas obras son de
una <b>elaboración lenta y artesanal </b>por su <b>minuciosidad,
tamaños y detalles</b>. Para crear una obra artística de estas características,
necesitas muchas más cosas, que el apreciado tiempo. Por eso <b>es
necesario el apoyo de los mecenas</b>, igual que ha sucedido a lo largo de los
siglos y a la manera que han sido creadas las obras antiguas, objeto de este
proyecto.... Sin embargo, <b>ya no es exclusividad </b>de unos pocos.
Hoy en día y a través de INDIEGOGO, el papel de mecenas está al alcance de
todos. Por eso te invito a que participes en esta campaña a tu medida, para ayudarme a crear, una pequeña y exclusiva colección, de arte inmóvil, que NUNCA
antes se ha  hecho. Ayudándome hacerla realidad... tú <b>como mecenas</b> serás el primero en
recibir los resultados.  <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<p><i>*Momento <i>de trabajo en el estudio.  Es como esculpir con pincel la forma desde la
planitud del lienzo.</i></i></p>
<br/><h3><b>¿Qué necesito y como lo voy a utilizar para lograr este proyecto?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>Recaudar con tu ayuda los 7.200 euros me permitirán continuar con este proyecto. Es la
cantidad mínima para cubrir solo los gastos de los materiales necesarios y hacer
llegar unas increíbles recompensas a tod@s que nos apoyan.</p>
<p>El dinero recaudado irá integramente para la realización del proyecto
completo; comprando materiales de arte de calidad para los diferentes cuadros y
bocetos como: lienzo de lino, bastidores, pigmentos, aglutinantes.
 También un fotógrafo profesional, diseño, papeles e impresión certificada
que responda a calidad museo de las recompensas, un embalaje adecuado y seguro,
envíos,  y estar en las obligaciones tributarias exigibles aquí. </p>
<p>Todos estos gastos son los mínimos necesarios para poder cumplir este
proyecto con garantías, sin costes personales, ni aplicar gastos extra, como
viajes a las diferentes ciudades, manutención que correrá por mi cuenta, igual
que el largo tiempo que necesito ""un
verdadero lujo"" (5-6
meses como poco) para realizarlo, o cualquier tipo de gasto que no está
relacionado directamente con la creación de la colección pictórica y su
reproducción en la máxima calidad que garantizará unas recompensas EXTRAORDINARIAS que
recibirás en tu casa. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">El presupuesto</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Los gastos necesarios
para cada una de las obras será conservativamente unos 650€, que en total son
3,250€ ( con el 21 % I.V.A. incluido) para los cinco lienzos grandes,
representando un 40% del presupuesto. El resto del presupuesto
se reparte de la siguiente manera:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453800601/s9wl3x37sd3y6lltoqqa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p><b>Si no </b><b>consigo </b><b>la cantidad completa que se solicita, </b>se seguirá
adelante con el proyecto de todas formas,  aunque por supuesto, se va a
retrasar, y me va a llevar más tiempo en completar  los trabajos.</p>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Sin embargo,
si conseguimos MÁS de lo que se ha pedido</b>, este proyecto se va a ENGRANDECER inmediatamente con
nuevas y originales propuestas, que <b>van
a incluir espectaculares piezas de todos los rincones de España</b>, que vamos
a elegir con la ayuda de todos. Se va a aprovechar cada céntimo de los fondos
recaudados extra para mostrar <u>la enorme diversidad de culturas</u> y,... las
recompensas podrán llegar a más personas y organizaciones interesadas en esta
propuesta.</p>
<p></p>
<br/><p></p>
<h3>¿Qué vas a recibir a
cambio de tu generosidad?</h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>La grandeza de una persona no se mide por lo que tienes...sino
por lo que das. Por eso, es de agradecer a todos los que se han envuelto
y nos ayudan de alguna manera. Incluso a aquellos que nos dedican su tiempo
simplemente a valorar este proyecto y a compartirlo.</p>
<p>A cambio de la generosidad mostrada,voy a entregar TODAS las obras que se
van a hacer pero, como los originales son tan pocos, y quiero llegar a mucha
gente, vamos a reproducirles en <b>los más altos estándares de calidad</b> que
existen, como por ejemplo, en impresión Fine Art Giclée<b>. </b></p>
<p>Para poder satisfacer diferentes exigencias y gustos, y para los diferentes
niveles de mecenazgo, se ha elaborado amplia variedad de recompensas para
elegir. Es una oportunidad SOLO para la campaña y su duración en INDIEGOGO.  </p>

 A parte de las recompensas que elijas más
abajo, veras que una de las cosas más importantes que también vas a recibir, (y
que no tiene precio), es la experiencia emocional de estar envuelto en un
proyecto artístico y llevarle a cabo.</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">

<h3><b><h3><b>Ideas y motivos por los que estarías
encantado de tener alguna de las recompensas del Murmullo</b></h3>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
</b></h3>
<p>      - para sentir la
diferencia de <u>SER mecenas</u><u></u> y no comprador de arte. </p>
<p>    - para tener una
obra de arte en tu hogar en la que  has
participado de alguna manera activa desde su creación hasta  su final, aportando un valor propio añadido a
la misma, convirtiéndola en experiencia artística.</p>
<p>  - para poder
contemplarla con amigos, hijos o familiares entorno a una conversación sobre arte,
historia, valores o lugares del mundo.</p>
<p>    - para animarte a
emprender algún viaje (que te puede cambiar la vida) o para recordarte alguno
relacionado con este maravilloso país España. 
</p>
<p>    - para comprender
mejor como eran las persona y como pensaban cuando todavía creían que el mundo
era plano. </p>
<p>    - para profundizar aprendiendo y descubriendo cosas de la
historia universal (como ha sido en mi caso)</p>
<p>      - para acercarte y descubrir un artista (yo mismo) y ¿porque
no a un amigo?!- empezando por unirte a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/daniel.yordanov.90260"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, ¡estaría encantado!</p>
<p>      - para estar más atento y empezar a escuchar el murmullo de
las piedras(porque donde está puesta una piedra, hay una intención humana),
vayas donde vayas, descubriendo lugares y vivencias. </p>
<p>    - ¿y porque qué no como un regalo original para esta
persona tan especial que tenemos todos?</p>
<br/><h3><b>El Impacto</b></h3>
<div>
<b></b><p>¡Con tu apoyo vas a permitir crear nuevas
formas de interpretar y difundir el patrimonio artístico universal! </p>
</div>
<div>
<b></b><p></p>
<p>Que éste es, autentico, original y exótico arte que <b>nunca pasará de moda, </b>lo demuestran las notas de
admiración y las descripciones de los viajeros a lo largo de los tiempos. Este
Patrimonio es <b>el
resultado de la convivencia de
distintas culturas </b>durante
siglos, que ha dejado en España <b>tesoros de valor incalculable</b>.
España es el tercer país del mundo en número de bienes declarados <b>Patrimonio
Mundial de la Humanidad. </b>Pero
las  obras del Murmullo están ancladas en un determinado lugar, que
solo se pueden ver, si tú te acercas a ellas. Y esto no siempre es posible..
Hay que tener en cuenta que las obras originales elegidas están en lugares y
sitios dispersos en la geografía, donde su contemplación es muy incómoda (por
su ubicación y las alturas), y breve (si eres turista), pero sobretodo
desconocidas todavía por mucha gente.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ahora, por primera vez podemos ACERCAR estas obras a tod@s 
que lo desean para DESCUBRIR algo único.  Con esta campaña de
micromecenazgo, además, es posible hacerlo PARA LA GENTE de TODO EL MUNDO.</p>
<p>Estas esculturas representan y nos transmiten valores, y son una parte importante de la historia universal. </p>
<p></p> ¡<i>Esto sin duda enriquece nuestros conocimientos! </i>
</div>
<div><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></div>
<p>Es un verdadero  <b>placer
visual</b> contemplar las obras elegidas, por ser extremadamente
narrativas y de gran belleza plástica.  El auténtico
faz de los motivos escultóricos se muestra con la luz adecuada, y para ello, he
pasado  horas observando y esperando captar estos momentos únicos que
les revelan en todo su esplendor.</p>
<p>Todavía se desconoce la autoría de algunas de las obras y el
significado de otras son un encantador misterio sin descodificar aun. Contienen
una gran <b>dosis de hechizo</b>, creyendo algunos que son portadores de
buenos augurios.  Se crearon como enormes libros en imágenes que ilustran a la perfección <b>el
auténtico carácter</b> de la gente de cada época. Si les observas, se
comprende mejor como fueron gente tan ilustre como:</p>
<p>La gran reina <b><u>Isabel la Católica</u></b>, el
imperador <b><u>Carlos V</u></b> (nunca se ponía el sol en sus
dominios),  descubridores de nuevos mundos como <b><u>Cristóbal Colón</u></b>,
exploradores como <b><u>Hernando de Magallanes</u></b>, grandes hombres de
las artes: <b><u>Diego Velázquez</u>, Rubens, <u>Goya</u> </b> o <b><u>Miguel
de Cervantes</u></b> y muchos otros personajes universales que, han
contemplado cruzándose las miradas con estos testigos excepcionales de la
historia. </p>

<p>The help we hope

singular sculptures which as they are carved on the façades of emblematic
buildings are not so easily accessible to the public and impossible to display
in museums. </p>
<p><i>And now that we know what this
is about</i>...</p>

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Let me present myself </b></h3>

My
name is Daniel. I am an artist, painter and artisan, living here in Valladolid
for 24 years.<br/>
</div>

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>I was first introduced into the world of art in the classrooms of the
School of Fine Arts in Sofia. My restlessness 
- desire to learn more - soon led me to cross Europe, enabling me to
develop as a person and artist until finally coming to Spain where I fell under
the spell of its beauty in art, perceiving it as the cradle and source of inspiration
to many other artists. I have learned from many great masters of painting, such
as Antonio López, one of the most famous living Spanish painters and have
learned the real techniques used over centuries in artisan centres like <a href=""http://www.cearcal.com/CEARCAL"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>CEARCAL</b></a><b>. </b>However, in addition to these influences just
contemplating the <b>immense artistic, historical</b> and <b>cultural treasures</b> in Spain has inspired and
delighted me.  </p>

<i>* </i><i>Many of my works of art and project
you can see in </i><a href=""https://www.behance.net/danielyordanov"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Behance</i></a><i> <span>are inspired by the enormous
cultural and artistic inheritance of Spain.</span></i>
</blockquote>
<p>Now after 20 years dedicating my <span>art uniquely to working
inspired by sculptures </span><span> on sites often “off the beaten track”
and to clients’ commissions, my hope is to bring many people closer to these
works and through my accumulated artistic experience to <b>share this universal artistic
legacy</b> that has been in some
of the most important cities in the heart of Spain for centuries. </span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<h3><b>What is
the project about?</b></h3>
<p>DISCOVER SCULPTURE THROUGH PAINTINGS! </p>
<p><b>""The murmur of the stones"" </b>is my own vision in my paintings <b>of <i>universal art in stone</i></b><i>. The works are <b>totally immovable</b> and <b>very ancient</b> (some works
are over 800 years old), of <b>great beauty </b>and <b>historical importance</b>. By
doing these paintings I aim to </i><b>BRING</b> <b>PEOPLE CLOSER</b> SO THEY MAY <b>RE-DISCOVER</b>
this art in an artistically original way. </p>
<p>My particular way of bringing these works to the
people is through large scale format paintings, respecting the proportions and
details of the originally chosen motifs, using a very personal pictorial technique to represent the sculptures in their whole
in the most attractive way.</p>
<p>  </p>

in its full grandeur. </p>

<p><b>To have a more complete
idea</b> of the exquisite heritage in Stone in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsXcxoGtrFw%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Castilla and León</a> (one of Europe’s richest regions in term of
cultural heritage - 8 places have been declared World Heritage by the
UNESCO, there are over 1800 sites of Cultural Interest, 140 Historical
monuments and 326 castles), - I decided to choose <b>five spectacular works
in five different cities</b> (Valladolid, Salamanca, León, Segovia and Zamora).
All of them are distinct in their <b>themes</b>,
and <b>styles</b>, and date from <b>different
epochs</b>, representing <b>different concepts</b>. </p>
<br/><p></p>
<h3><b>What exactly does the project
consist of?</b></h3>
<p><b>My objective is to realise:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Five large scale format works.  Their size is conditioned by the original
motifs, and is very close to the original dimensions and the Works are very
faithful to the existing details. They have been painted in a very personal
technique, based on traditional techniques and artisanship from </span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">grisalla
painting and Trompe l´oeil</i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">, all of them with </span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">natural and environmentally
friendly materials, such as </i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">tempera, egg and linen canvas, etc.)</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Various sketches with creta, pencil and inks on different sized pieces
of card, made with the renaissance artistic techniques.</span><br/>
</li></ul>
<div><br/></div>
<p>For me one of the most difficult parts
of the project was <b>to select the motifs</b>. </p>
<p><i>- How could I pick out the most representative,
interesting and attractive works?</i></p>
<p>To make the best pick, after infinite
hours of observation, once having taken into account the  opinion of specialists in the field, such as
restorers, art historians and others, in the end I had to follow the guidance
of the <b>what was special in the works
themselves and what they had transmitted to me</b>. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455040201/qzdt8ngne0lxikcoe3dv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p><b><i>                        The motifs chosen
to be represented are:</i></b></p>
<p><b>1. </b><i>Mythological</i><i>Sculptures at the </i>The Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso. baroque style. 1722 cerca

<h3>Why do I need your help?</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p>Since 2007 I have been experimenting and seeking
the most faithful but personal way to represent these treasures carved on stone.
So far I have always invested my own time and money in this, although this has
slowed down all the development. One must take into account that I will
elaborate these works dedicating all the time necessary – I will only be satisfied with the my most care
and achieving the best <span>results</span><span>,
getting the size just right and taking care down to the <b>finest details</b>. To
create an artistic work of these characteristics, I need many things other than
time and commitment, so valuable. All of this means <b>having the support of patrons</b>,
just as has been the case over the centuries, shown in the way in which the
ancient treasures, the object of this project were created. However, <b>being a patron no longer remains the possibility of only a few</b>, but rather nowadays, and through INDIEGOGO,
the role of encouraging and backing art is in the reach of all. This is why I
invite you to participate in this “made to measure” campaign to help me create
a small and exclusive collection of immobile art which has NEVER BEEN “moved” before
from the sculpture to the canvas. Help me to
make this a reality ... <b>you as a patron</b> will be the first to
receive the results.  </span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455041387/ccuhjf4rsfa1lslzmxke.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>*Working in the studio.
I “sculpture” with my brush on the flatness of the canvas.</i></p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<h3>What do I need and how am I going to use it to make this project a success?</h3>
<p>Finding funds of 7<span> 200 euros will allow me to take this project to
its successful end. This is the minimum quantity to cover just the expenses of
the necessary materials and to send you the lovingly crafted perks of thanks and recognition for all those who supported me and made this possible.
</span></p>
<p>The funds raised will go in their entirety to
carry out the project in full; buying the art materials of quality for the
different pictures and sketches, such as the linen canvases, <span>embroidery frames, pigments, and binders.  Also
hiring a professional photographer, design paper and certified printing which
is up to the necessary museum quality of the perks, safe packaging, the dispatches and to satisfy all tax
requirements generated by this.   </span></p>
<p>All these expenses are the minimum required so
as to guarantee the successful accomplishment of this project, without adding
in personal costs, or extra expenses such as trips to other cities, lodging and
food - which I am happy to pay for out of my own pocket – and most importantly
the time dedicated ""a true luxury"" (5 to 6 months at the least) to carrying
it out, or any other type of expense that is not directly related to the creation
of the picture collection and their reproduction at the maximum quality level which
will guarantee the EXTRAORDINARY PERKS - TOKENS OF THANKS AND RECOGNITION - you
will receive at home.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>The budget</b></h3>
<p>The expenses necessary for
each one the works will at a conservative estimate be about € 650, which make a
total of € 3250  (with 21 % VAT included)
for the five large scales canvases, representing 40% of the budgeted figure. The
rest is divided in the following way: 40 % expenses of materials, 39 % prints,
4 % photography and design, 8 % packaging and post, 9 % crowd-funding and bank
commissions.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p><b>If I don’t raise the complete
amount needed</b>, I
shall continue with the project anyway, although, of course, it is going to be slowed down as it
will require more of my time to complete all the pieces – though I am more than
prepared to dedicate all that is necessary. </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>However, if we raise more than what is asked for</b>, <span>this project will move up a notch
immediately to take on new and original proposals, which </span><span>WILL INCLUDE SPECTACULAR PIECES FROM
ALL ACROSS SPAIN, chosen with the help of everybody. We will use to the full every cent
raised to show <u>the enormous diversity of cultures
in Spain</u>, and
to ensure more perks can be sent out to the people.</span></p>

<h3>
<b>What are you
going to receive in</b><b> recognition
of and exchange for your generosity?</b>
</h3>
<p>The generosity of all people should not be judged
by what she or he has, but rather what they give. This is why all artists must thank all those who surround
him or her and have helped them in some way. Even those who simply dedicate their time to just
value the project and to share it. </p>
<p>In exchange and recognition for
the generosity shown I will deliver to all patrons a representations of the works
of art that are made, but there
are so few of <b>the originals</b> and I
want to reach so many people. I am going to reproduce them with <b>the highest
standards of quality that currently exist</b>, one of which is Fine Art Giclée. </p>
<p>In order to satisfy diverse
demands and tastes, and for different levels of patronage, I have drawn up a
wide range of perks from which the patrons can choose. It is an opportunity
ONLY VALID while the campaign is ongoing and it will remain so as long as it is
in INDIEGOGO.  </p>
<p>In addition to the perks you
can choose from below, you will see that one of the most important rewards you
are going to receive (and this is priceless), is the emotional experience that
surrounds the artistic project as it becomes a reality .</p>

<h3>Ideas and reasons why you will be
delighted to have one of the perks of thanks and recognition of the Murmur</h3>
<p>   - to feel and to
know the difference between <u>BEING A PATRON </u><span>and not just a buyer of art.</span></p>
<p>    - to have in your home a work of art in which you have participated actively
from its creation through to the end, adding value to it and converting all the
process into YOUR OWN artistic experience.</p>
<p>    - afterwards you will be able to contemplate it with friends,
children, and relatives, in a quiet conversation on art, history, values or
places in the world.</p>
<p>    - serves as an
encouragement to undertake a trip (one can that mark or change your life) or to
remind you of something marvellous about Spain. </p>
<p>    - to understand what
people are and used to be like and how hard they used to strive for truth in
the epoch when they still believed the earth was flat.</p>
<p> 
  - to delve deeper into learning and discovering new ideas on the history
of the university (as has been my case)</p>
<p>    - to come closer to
and discover an artist (I,
myself) and why not a friend? - start
by joining to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/daniel.yordanov.90260"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>.I’d be delighted!</p>
<p>     - to be more aware and
“awake” as one listens to the murmur of the stone (for wherever there is a stone
placed there is a good human intention), wherever you go, discovering new
places and experiences.</p>
<p><b>    </b>- All of us have a person who is special to us and so
why not make them an original gift?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your support you are going to make
possible new ways of interpreting and spreading our universal artistic
heritage.</p>
<p>The fact that this is <b>authentic</b>, <b>original</b> and <b>exotic art</b>
that <b>will never go out of fashion</b>
is shown by the exclamations, notes of admiration and descriptions made
by travellers over time. <b>This heritage
is the result of distinct cultures
living together</b> over
centuries, leaving Spain with <b>treasures
of an incalculable value</b>. Spain is the third country in the world in
terms of the number of sites of heritage declared <b>World Heritage of Humanity</b>.<span> However,
the works of the Murmur are anchored in their own specific places,
and only can be seen if you go to that place. And this is not always possible.
One must take into account that the original works chosen are on sites spread
out over Spain, sometimes where contemplating them implies one making a
strenuous effort (because of their placing or height), and they can only be
seen briefly – one is a tourist, and so above all they remain unknown to many people.</span></p>
<p>So for the first time we are going to
BRING these works of art CLOSER to everybody who wants to DISCOVER something
new. With this campaign for patrons it is possible to BRING ART TO PEOPLE IN
ALL THE WORLD.</p>
<p>These sculptures represent and transmit values
that are important for the history of our universe. </p>
<p><b><i>Beyond
doubt this deepens our understanding and wisdom! </i></b></p>
<p>It is a true <b>visual pleasure</b> to contemplate the works chosen, even
more so as they are extremely narrative and show the great beauty of plastic
art. The authentic face of the sculptured motifs are when they are seen in the
right light, and to get this effect in its full I have spent hours observing
them, an eye on the sky to capture them in their moments of finest splendour. </p>
<p>We still do not know who were the authors of some of
the works, and the significance of others remain giving them an  <b>enchanting
mystery</b>, not yet de-coded. Each work casts its own spell, which leads some to believe that they all
bring good portents. The works were created <b>as books of large pictures perfectly illustrating </b>the people’s <b>real character</b> in each epoch over
history. By looking at them intently one can better perceive these enlightened
people, such as the great queen <u>Isabel the Catholic,</u> the emperor <u>Carlo the Fifth</u> (“the sun
never went down on his domains”), and discovers of the new world, such as <u>Christopher Columbus</u>, explorers like
<u>Hernando de Magallanes</u>,
great men of art like <u>Diego Velázquez</u>, <u>Francisco de Goya,</u> <u>Miguel de
Cervantes</u> <span>and many other characters
who have survived over the centuries, and who have made their mark on history
and been worthy witness.  </span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<h3><b><b>Why
does this mean so much to me? </b></b></h3>
<b>
</b><p>In 1998 I had the honour and good
fortune to be the first artisan specialized in ornamental mural painting in the
Spanish region of Castilla and León, bring back this artisan’s craft.</p>
<p>Through my art I always try to
contribute to beauty and build on the important role classic art has today in
our modern world. </p>

<p>In a special way this project
is changing my life. The work put in over so many years is now bearing fruit,
as shown by the fact that one of the Murmur of the stones paintings won one of
the most relevant awards in a plastic arts competition in Castilla and León. <a href=""https://youtu.be/alPhfoqaCfI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ver video</a></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>I feel it is rewarding to see a ""Murmur"" in
the entrance to the “<u>Las Cortes de Castilla and León</u>” (the
law courts). It is in perfect harmony and sits well with history, culture and
artistic tradition, and yet it is still modern. </p>
<p>All of this, together with the
positive comments from across the spectrum make it worthwhile, gives me a push
to keep going, plus I am fortunate to be able to count on a <u>great and supportive team.</u>  This
keeps one feeling positive and keen<span> to do my best
for this novel project in ""my
way"". </span></p>

<h3><b>Other ways in which you can help</b></h3>
<p>We
know that not everybody can help economically, but another way to help us to
push forward is to be an AMBASSADOR of The Murmur of the stones, spread the word about our
project with friends and other people you meet. Use tools like INDIEGOGO or
other social media to share the news, simply copy and paste this link:</p>

<b>Risks</b><b> and challenges</b>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Life itself is a challenge and
so the biggest risk of missing out would be not
being bold enough to explore what brings passion and fun to life. </p>
<p>Another danger would be to get
stuck in the past, enamoured with the works of sculpture as if they had to
remain in just one form of presentation. We are not limited to the sculptures
of the project. We want to go further and out of respect and admiration we want
to find a new way to discover the riches of these works.  </p>
<p>Everything comes together in
inviting you to join us on this project, and to be a witness of not simply what
we are going to do but also to feel how emotive it is, watching step by step as
we share this adventure with you .. So are you coming on board?  </p>

Erase una vez...cuando las cosas importantes para transmitir se esculpían
en las fachadas.



Con la ayuda en esta campaña, el  proyecto El
murmullo de las piedras nos permitirá acercar por primera vez, desde
que han sido creadas, unas obras de Arte espectacular, con un valor
histórico y cultural incalculable, para poder contemplar, entender y
disfrutarlas como nunca! Con su enigmática
belleza van a estimular nuestra curiosidad a profundizar en el conocimiento que
atesoran bajo su imagen.   Hablamos de obras escultóricas singulares que, por ser inamovible parte
de edificios emblemáticos, están lejos del gran público e imposible de
alojar en los museos.   
Ahora ya sabemos cómo hacerlo...

Presentarme  
Mi
nombre es Daniel Yordanov, soy artista plástico y artesano muralista, afincado
en Valladolid, España desde hace 24 años.   
Después de mi primera formación artística en la escuela de Bellas Artes
en Sofia, Bulgaria, la inquietud me lleva a cruzar Europa para enriquecerme como
persona y artista y....finalmente quedarme hechizado en España como  cuna
y fuente de inspiración de muchos otros artistas. He estado aprendiendo de grandes
maestros de la pintura, como mi admirado Antonio
López y formándome en las autenticas técnicas antiguas en centros de oficios
artesanales como CEARCAL,
pero sobre todo INSPIRADO y ENTUSIASMADO por el inmenso tesoro artístico, histórico y cultural que hay en España. 
™



* muchos de mis trabajos y proyectos de Arte mural que puedes ver en Behance, están inspirados por el enorme patrimonio cultural artístico. 



Después de más de 20 años dedicando mi arte para
sitios y clientes exclusivos, mi ilusión es acercar a muchas más personas a
través de este  proyecto, la experiencia artística acumulada y, una
necesidad de compartir un
legado artístico universal de interés mundial que yace en las alturas de los
edificios de algunas de las más importantes ciudades en el corazón de España
desde hace siglos.  
¿Sobre qué va el proyecto?DESCUBRIR LA
ESCULTURA A TRAVÉS DE LA PINTURA! 
El
murmullo de las piedras es, mi particular visión pictórica  de obras del arte universal en piedra,
totalmente inamovibles, muy antiguas (algunas de más de 800 años) , de gran
belleza e importancia histórica. De esta forma pretendo  ACERCARLAS a
la gente y RE-DESCUBRIRLAS  de una manera artística
original. 
La particular
fórmula para hacerlo, es a través de pinturas de gran formato, respetando las proporciones y detalles de los motivos originales elegidos. Voy a utilizar una técnica
 pictórica muy personal para,  representar de la forma más atractiva los conjuntos escultóricos. 


 

El trabajo de la colección se complementará con los bocetos
preparatorios para los lienzos. buscando a entender mejor y ENRIQUECER  la percepción de los conjuntos
monumentales.





Para tener
una idea algo más completa del
exquisito patrimonio de piedra en Castilla y León (una de las regiones en EUROPA más
rica en patrimonio cultural - 8 puntos declarados Patrimonio Mundial por la
UNESCO, más de 1800 Bienes de Interés Cultural, 140 Conjuntos
Históricos, 326 castillos y mucho más), - he decidido elegir 5
obras espectaculares, de cinco ciudades diferentes (Valladolid,
Salamanca, León, Segovia y Zamora). Todas ellas de distinta  temática,
estilos, épocas y que
representan diferentes
conceptos.
¿En qué consiste exactamente el proyecto?

 

Mi objetivo es realizar:


Cinco obras de gran formato.
 Los tamaños están acondicionados por los motivos originales, muy cercanos
a sus dimensiones originales y así, ser fiel a todos los detalles existentes.
 Pintados con una técnica muy personal, y basada en técnicas tradicionales
y artesanales de pintura como la grisalla y
el trampantojo (Trompe l´oeil), todos ellos con materiales naturales y
amables con el medio ambiente como:
(pigmentos naturales, tempera, huevo, tela de lino, etc.)



Varios bocetos con creta, sanguina, aguadas, lápiz
y tizas sobre cartulina de diferentes tamaños (técnicas de los dibujos renacentistas) 

Una de las partes más difíciles de este proyecto para mi es, la
elección de los motivos. 
-¿Cómo puedo elegir las obras más representativas,
interesantes y atractivas?
Por eso, después de infinitas horas de
observación,  y tener en cuenta también la opinión de especialistas en la
materia como restauradores, historiadores del arte etc, al final ...he
decidido dejarme llevar por algo especial que me han transmitido las
PROPIAS obras.






Los motivos elegidos
para representar son:

1. Esculturas mitológicas del Palacio de La Granja de San Ildefonso.
Segovia. Estilo barroco. Año 1722 apx (s. XVIII)
2. Capiteles Claustro Convento de las
Dueñas. Salamanca. Estilo renacentista.   Año 1533 apx  (s. XVI)
3. El mítico hombre natural. Fachada
Colegio de San Gregorio. Valladolid. Estilo gótico isabelino. Año 1496 apx (s. XV)
4. Figuras de los
músicos de la portada
norte de la Colegiata de Toro. Zamora. Estilo románico. Año 1170 apx (s. XII)
5. Detalle del
infierno. Catedral de León. Estilo Gótico Año 1270 aprox (s. XIII)



¿Por que necesito tu ayuda?




Desde 2007 llevo experimentando y buscando la forma más fidedigna, pero personal
de representar estos tesoros en piedra. Hasta ahora siempre he invertido
mis propios recursos en tiempo y dinero, y por eso el desarrollo de esta idea
se ha ralentizado mucho.  Hay que tener en cuenta que, estas obras son de
una elaboración lenta y artesanal por su minuciosidad,
tamaños y detalles. Para crear una obra artística de estas características,
necesitas muchas más cosas, que el apreciado tiempo. Por eso es
necesario el apoyo de los mecenas, igual que ha sucedido a lo largo de los
siglos y a la manera que han sido creadas las obras antiguas, objeto de este
proyecto.... Sin embargo, ya no es exclusividad de unos pocos.
Hoy en día y a través de INDIEGOGO, el papel de mecenas está al alcance de
todos. Por eso te invito a que participes en esta campaña a tu medida, para ayudarme a crear, una pequeña y exclusiva colección, de arte inmóvil, que NUNCA
antes se ha  hecho. Ayudándome hacerla realidad... tú como mecenas serás el primero en
recibir los resultados.   


*Momento de trabajo en el estudio.  Es como esculpir con pincel la forma desde la
planitud del lienzo.
¿Qué necesito y como lo voy a utilizar para lograr este proyecto?



Recaudar con tu ayuda los 7.200 euros me permitirán continuar con este proyecto. Es la
cantidad mínima para cubrir solo los gastos de los materiales necesarios y hacer
llegar unas increíbles recompensas a tod@s que nos apoyan.
El dinero recaudado irá integramente para la realización del proyecto
completo; comprando materiales de arte de calidad para los diferentes cuadros y
bocetos como: lienzo de lino, bastidores, pigmentos, aglutinantes.
 También un fotógrafo profesional, diseño, papeles e impresión certificada
que responda a calidad museo de las recompensas, un embalaje adecuado y seguro,
envíos,  y estar en las obligaciones tributarias exigibles aquí. 
Todos estos gastos son los mínimos necesarios para poder cumplir este
proyecto con garantías, sin costes personales, ni aplicar gastos extra, como
viajes a las diferentes ciudades, manutención que correrá por mi cuenta, igual
que el largo tiempo que necesito ""un
verdadero lujo"" (5-6
meses como poco) para realizarlo, o cualquier tipo de gasto que no está
relacionado directamente con la creación de la colección pictórica y su
reproducción en la máxima calidad que garantizará unas recompensas EXTRAORDINARIAS que
recibirás en tu casa. 


El presupuesto
Los gastos necesarios
para cada una de las obras será conservativamente unos 650€, que en total son
3,250€ ( con el 21 % I.V.A. incluido) para los cinco lienzos grandes,
representando un 40% del presupuesto. El resto del presupuesto
se reparte de la siguiente manera:




Si no consigo la cantidad completa que se solicita, se seguirá
adelante con el proyecto de todas formas,  aunque por supuesto, se va a
retrasar, y me va a llevar más tiempo en completar  los trabajos.



Sin embargo,
si conseguimos MÁS de lo que se ha pedido, este proyecto se va a ENGRANDECER inmediatamente con
nuevas y originales propuestas, que van
a incluir espectaculares piezas de todos los rincones de España, que vamos
a elegir con la ayuda de todos. Se va a aprovechar cada céntimo de los fondos
recaudados extra para mostrar la enorme diversidad de culturas y,... las
recompensas podrán llegar a más personas y organizaciones interesadas en esta
propuesta.


¿Qué vas a recibir a
cambio de tu generosidad?


La grandeza de una persona no se mide por lo que tienes...sino
por lo que das. Por eso, es de agradecer a todos los que se han envuelto
y nos ayudan de alguna manera. Incluso a aquellos que nos dedican su tiempo
simplemente a valorar este proyecto y a compartirlo.
A cambio de la generosidad mostrada,voy a entregar TODAS las obras que se
van a hacer pero, como los originales son tan pocos, y quiero llegar a mucha
gente, vamos a reproducirles en los más altos estándares de calidad que
existen, como por ejemplo, en impresión Fine Art Giclée. 
Para poder satisfacer diferentes exigencias y gustos, y para los diferentes
niveles de mecenazgo, se ha elaborado amplia variedad de recompensas para
elegir. Es una oportunidad SOLO para la campaña y su duración en INDIEGOGO.  

 A parte de las recompensas que elijas más
abajo, veras que una de las cosas más importantes que también vas a recibir, (y
que no tiene precio), es la experiencia emocional de estar envuelto en un
proyecto artístico y llevarle a cabo.

 
Las recompensas en los diferentes niveles de mecenazgo:

curiosidad les lleve a contar el número de leones allí colocados nunca
terminarían sus estudios universitarios


Una enooorme postal de agradecimiento, de 14,8 x 21cm (5,8"" x 8,3"").

Ideas y motivos por los que estarías
encantado de tener alguna de las recompensas del Murmullo


      - para sentir la
diferencia de SER mecenas y no comprador de arte. 
    - para tener una
obra de arte en tu hogar en la que  has
participado de alguna manera activa desde su creación hasta  su final, aportando un valor propio añadido a
la misma, convirtiéndola en experiencia artística.
  - para poder
contemplarla con amigos, hijos o familiares entorno a una conversación sobre arte,
historia, valores o lugares del mundo.
    - para animarte a
emprender algún viaje (que te puede cambiar la vida) o para recordarte alguno
relacionado con este maravilloso país España. 

    - para comprender
mejor como eran las persona y como pensaban cuando todavía creían que el mundo
era plano. 
    - para profundizar aprendiendo y descubriendo cosas de la
historia universal (como ha sido en mi caso)
      - para acercarte y descubrir un artista (yo mismo) y ¿porque
no a un amigo?!- empezando por unirte a Facebook, ¡estaría encantado!
      - para estar más atento y empezar a escuchar el murmullo de
las piedras(porque donde está puesta una piedra, hay una intención humana),
vayas donde vayas, descubriendo lugares y vivencias. 
    - ¿y porque qué no como un regalo original para esta
persona tan especial que tenemos todos?
El Impacto

¡Con tu apoyo vas a permitir crear nuevas
formas de interpretar y difundir el patrimonio artístico universal! 



Que éste es, autentico, original y exótico arte que nunca pasará de moda, lo demuestran las notas de
admiración y las descripciones de los viajeros a lo largo de los tiempos. Este
Patrimonio es el
resultado de la convivencia de
distintas culturas durante
siglos, que ha dejado en España tesoros de valor incalculable.
España es el tercer país del mundo en número de bienes declarados Patrimonio
Mundial de la Humanidad. Pero
las  obras del Murmullo están ancladas en un determinado lugar, que
solo se pueden ver, si tú te acercas a ellas. Y esto no siempre es posible..
Hay que tener en cuenta que las obras originales elegidas están en lugares y
sitios dispersos en la geografía, donde su contemplación es muy incómoda (por
su ubicación y las alturas), y breve (si eres turista), pero sobretodo
desconocidas todavía por mucha gente.


Ahora, por primera vez podemos ACERCAR estas obras a tod@s 
que lo desean para DESCUBRIR algo único.  Con esta campaña de
micromecenazgo, además, es posible hacerlo PARA LA GENTE de TODO EL MUNDO.
Estas esculturas representan y nos transmiten valores, y son una parte importante de la historia universal. 
 ¡Esto sin duda enriquece nuestros conocimientos! 


Es un verdadero  placer
visual contemplar las obras elegidas, por ser extremadamente
narrativas y de gran belleza plástica.  El auténtico
faz de los motivos escultóricos se muestra con la luz adecuada, y para ello, he
pasado  horas observando y esperando captar estos momentos únicos que
les revelan en todo su esplendor.
Todavía se desconoce la autoría de algunas de las obras y el
significado de otras son un encantador misterio sin descodificar aun. Contienen
una gran dosis de hechizo, creyendo algunos que son portadores de
buenos augurios.  Se crearon como enormes libros en imágenes que ilustran a la perfección el
auténtico carácter de la gente de cada época. Si les observas, se
comprende mejor como fueron gente tan ilustre como:
La gran reina Isabel la Católica, el
imperador Carlos V (nunca se ponía el sol en sus
dominios),  descubridores de nuevos mundos como Cristóbal Colón,
exploradores como Hernando de Magallanes, grandes hombres de
las artes: Diego Velázquez, Rubens, Goya  o Miguel
de Cervantes y muchos otros personajes universales que, han
contemplado cruzándose las miradas con estos testigos excepcionales de la
historia. 




¿Por qué es tan importante para mí? 




En 1998 tuve la suerte de ser el primer artesano especializado en pintura ornamental
sobre el muro  en la región de Castilla y León, recuperando de
nuevo este arte y oficio.

Siempre intento contribuir con mi arte a difundir la belleza y el importante
papel que tiene el arte clásico en nuestra vida moderna.  

REFLEJADO EN LOS MEDIOS



Este proyecto de una
manera muy especial está cambiando mi vida... El trabajo de  tantos años ya está dando resultados, siendo
premiado uno de los cuadros del Murmullo de las piedras en uno de los concursos más relevantes de artes plásticas en la región de Castilla y León en España. Ver video



Me hace feliz ver un ""Murmullo""  en la entrada de Las Cortes de
Castilla y León en una perfecta armonía, conviviendo la
modernidad con la historia, la cultura y la tradición artística.


... y esto junto con las
muchísimas referencias positivas de  la
gente, y gracias al apoyo de un GRAN EQUIPO, me anima a seguir con ilusión, contribuyendo ""a mi
manera""  con este novedoso proyecto.

Riesgos y desafíos



La vida en si es un desafío,
así que lo más arriesgado seria no aventurarse en explorar lo que te apasiona
en la vida.

Otro
peligro podría ser; quedarte enganchado y enamorado de las obras escultóricas,
no solo a las propuestas en el proyecto, pero por todo lo que
empieces a descubrir a raíz de esta idea. 
Por eso
te invito a que nos acompañes en este proyecto, y ser testigo no solo de lo que
vamos a hacer, sino de lo emocionante que va a ser, y CóMO se hace, paso a
paso, compartiendo contigo esta (aventura)....así que...¿TE APUNTAS?


¡Muchísimas gracias por tu apoyo de ante mano!




English
Once upon a time the important values to be transmitted
were sculptured on the façades.

The help we hope
to receive for this campaign the ""murmur of the stones""
will for the first time allow many people to draw close to spectacular
works of art, of an incalculable
historical and cultural value and enable
us to contemplate, understand and enjoy them in a way we have never done before. Their
enigmatic beauty is going to stimulate our curiosity and desire to go deeper
into the knowledge hidden in the treasure, in the image. We are speaking about
singular sculptures which as they are carved on the façades of emblematic
buildings are not so easily accessible to the public and impossible to display
in museums. 
And now that we know what this
is about...

Let me present myself 

My
name is Daniel. I am an artist, painter and artisan, living here in Valladolid
for 24 years.







I was first introduced into the world of art in the classrooms of the
School of Fine Arts in Sofia. My restlessness 
- desire to learn more - soon led me to cross Europe, enabling me to
develop as a person and artist until finally coming to Spain where I fell under
the spell of its beauty in art, perceiving it as the cradle and source of inspiration
to many other artists. I have learned from many great masters of painting, such
as Antonio López, one of the most famous living Spanish painters and have
learned the real techniques used over centuries in artisan centres like CEARCAL. However, in addition to these influences just
contemplating the immense artistic, historical and cultural treasures in Spain has inspired and
delighted me.  




* Many of my works of art and project
you can see in Behance are inspired by the enormous
cultural and artistic inheritance of Spain.

Now after 20 years dedicating my art uniquely to working
inspired by sculptures  on sites often “off the beaten track”
and to clients’ commissions, my hope is to bring many people closer to these
works and through my accumulated artistic experience to share this universal artistic
legacy that has been in some
of the most important cities in the heart of Spain for centuries. 

What is
the project about?
DISCOVER SCULPTURE THROUGH PAINTINGS! 
""The murmur of the stones"" is my own vision in my paintings of universal art in stone. The works are totally immovable and very ancient (some works
are over 800 years old), of great beauty and historical importance. By
doing these paintings I aim to BRING PEOPLE CLOSER SO THEY MAY RE-DISCOVER
this art in an artistically original way. 
My particular way of bringing these works to the
people is through large scale format paintings, respecting the proportions and
details of the originally chosen motifs, using a very personal pictorial technique to represent the sculptures in their whole
in the most attractive way.
  



*Motif taken from a sculpture
of the façade of the University of Valladolid, representing the Allegory of the
Sciences (Geometry), interpreted on canvas

The work of the collection is complemented with
the preparatory sketches for the canvases, seeking to better understand
and enhance the perception of the monuments
in its full grandeur. 


To have a more complete
idea of the exquisite heritage in Stone in Castilla and León (one of Europe’s richest regions in term of
cultural heritage - 8 places have been declared World Heritage by the
UNESCO, there are over 1800 sites of Cultural Interest, 140 Historical
monuments and 326 castles), - I decided to choose five spectacular works
in five different cities (Valladolid, Salamanca, León, Segovia and Zamora).
All of them are distinct in their themes,
and styles, and date from different
epochs, representing different concepts. 

What exactly does the project
consist of?
My objective is to realise:


Five large scale format works.  Their size is conditioned by the original
motifs, and is very close to the original dimensions and the Works are very
faithful to the existing details. They have been painted in a very personal
technique, based on traditional techniques and artisanship from grisalla
painting and Trompe l´oeil, all of them with natural and environmentally
friendly materials, such as tempera, egg and linen canvas, etc.)


Various sketches with creta, pencil and inks on different sized pieces
of card, made with the renaissance artistic techniques.


For me one of the most difficult parts
of the project was to select the motifs. 
- How could I pick out the most representative,
interesting and attractive works?
To make the best pick, after infinite
hours of observation, once having taken into account the  opinion of specialists in the field, such as
restorers, art historians and others, in the end I had to follow the guidance
of the what was special in the works
themselves and what they had transmitted to me. 





                        The motifs chosen
to be represented are:
1. MythologicalSculptures at the The Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso. baroque style. 1722 cerca
(s. XVIII)
2. Capiteles of  the Cloister of the Convent of the Owners. Renaissance style.  
1533 (s. XVI)
3. The mythical
natural man. Façade of the College of Saint Gregorio. Isabelina Gothic style. Year 1496
(s. XV)
4. Figures of the musicians,
Northern portal of the Collegiate Church in Toro - Zamora. Romanic style. Year 1170 (s. XII)
5. Close up of hell. Cathedral of León. Gothic
style, Year 1270 (s. XIII)

Why do I need your help?

Since 2007 I have been experimenting and seeking
the most faithful but personal way to represent these treasures carved on stone.
So far I have always invested my own time and money in this, although this has
slowed down all the development. One must take into account that I will
elaborate these works dedicating all the time necessary – I will only be satisfied with the my most care
and achieving the best results,
getting the size just right and taking care down to the finest details. To
create an artistic work of these characteristics, I need many things other than
time and commitment, so valuable. All of this means having the support of patrons,
just as has been the case over the centuries, shown in the way in which the
ancient treasures, the object of this project were created. However, being a patron no longer remains the possibility of only a few, but rather nowadays, and through INDIEGOGO,
the role of encouraging and backing art is in the reach of all. This is why I
invite you to participate in this “made to measure” campaign to help me create
a small and exclusive collection of immobile art which has NEVER BEEN “moved” before
from the sculpture to the canvas. Help me to
make this a reality ... you as a patron will be the first to
receive the results.  


*Working in the studio.
I “sculpture” with my brush on the flatness of the canvas.

What do I need and how am I going to use it to make this project a success?
Finding funds of 7 200 euros will allow me to take this project to
its successful end. This is the minimum quantity to cover just the expenses of
the necessary materials and to send you the lovingly crafted perks of thanks and recognition for all those who supported me and made this possible.

The funds raised will go in their entirety to
carry out the project in full; buying the art materials of quality for the
different pictures and sketches, such as the linen canvases, embroidery frames, pigments, and binders.  Also
hiring a professional photographer, design paper and certified printing which
is up to the necessary museum quality of the perks, safe packaging, the dispatches and to satisfy all tax
requirements generated by this.   
All these expenses are the minimum required so
as to guarantee the successful accomplishment of this project, without adding
in personal costs, or extra expenses such as trips to other cities, lodging and
food - which I am happy to pay for out of my own pocket – and most importantly
the time dedicated ""a true luxury"" (5 to 6 months at the least) to carrying
it out, or any other type of expense that is not directly related to the creation
of the picture collection and their reproduction at the maximum quality level which
will guarantee the EXTRAORDINARY PERKS - TOKENS OF THANKS AND RECOGNITION - you
will receive at home.  

The budget
The expenses necessary for
each one the works will at a conservative estimate be about € 650, which make a
total of € 3250  (with 21 % VAT included)
for the five large scales canvases, representing 40% of the budgeted figure. The
rest is divided in the following way: 40 % expenses of materials, 39 % prints,
4 % photography and design, 8 % packaging and post, 9 % crowd-funding and bank
commissions.





If I don’t raise the complete
amount needed, I
shall continue with the project anyway, although, of course, it is going to be slowed down as it
will require more of my time to complete all the pieces – though I am more than
prepared to dedicate all that is necessary. 

However, if we raise more than what is asked for, this project will move up a notch
immediately to take on new and original proposals, which WILL INCLUDE SPECTACULAR PIECES FROM
ALL ACROSS SPAIN, chosen with the help of everybody. We will use to the full every cent
raised to show the enormous diversity of cultures
in Spain, and
to ensure more perks can be sent out to the people.


What are you
going to receive in recognition
of and exchange for your generosity?

The generosity of all people should not be judged
by what she or he has, but rather what they give. This is why all artists must thank all those who surround
him or her and have helped them in some way. Even those who simply dedicate their time to just
value the project and to share it. 
In exchange and recognition for
the generosity shown I will deliver to all patrons a representations of the works
of art that are made, but there
are so few of the originals and I
want to reach so many people. I am going to reproduce them with the highest
standards of quality that currently exist, one of which is Fine Art Giclée. 
In order to satisfy diverse
demands and tastes, and for different levels of patronage, I have drawn up a
wide range of perks from which the patrons can choose. It is an opportunity
ONLY VALID while the campaign is ongoing and it will remain so as long as it is
in INDIEGOGO.  
In addition to the perks you
can choose from below, you will see that one of the most important rewards you
are going to receive (and this is priceless), is the emotional experience that
surrounds the artistic project as it becomes a reality .

The perks for these
different degrees of patronage, the reproductions we send out as a way of saying a big thank you are:


We will send it
to you wherever you may be!

* Your full name and
the city you are from (if you so wish) will be on the patron wall on our Facebook
page.






* Example
– this one is of the lions (symbol of the watching over of values, among others)
which mark off the legal space in the campus, a privilege which was enjoyed by
the University of Valladolid, one of the oldest universities. 
The legend
says: “Those who out of curiosity count the number of lions set up shall never
finish their university studies.”



An enormous 21 cm postcard of
gratitude from Valladolid. In reality it is MORE THAN JUST a postcard: it is one of the works printed and
SIGNED, size A5, and ready to be framed and placed wherever you wish. We are
going to put on the card the relevant information of the monument. 

* This is only
an example
We will send it
to you wherever you may be!




*always  sent out by certified post. 




*The only way to have the
originals of the large scale works in the small size!
 DURABILITY + 200 YEARS
Only in INDIEGOGO and LIMITED TO 50 EXAMPLES FOR EACH MOTIF!

You can choose BEAUTY, MYSTERY, PURITY,
CREATIVITY or FEARS, one of the 5 works of the project in large
scale format, printed on Ceclée,
SIGNED and NUMBERED. Always  sent out by certified post.

* Pre-order now your ""Murmur"" HERE to go on the designated sidebar. There are only 50, and YOU CAN CHANGE IT FOR ANOTHER ONE, if you so wish, before the campaign ends.





Your generosity enables the generosity of many
others. Learning and training mean that people and altruistic initiatives are
necessary. Palliative care is necessary for every person who is facing the end
of their life. I shall give all the money raised to a training group that is
developing an NGO “palliative care without frontiers”.           For more information: http://www.paliativossinfronteras.com/es/
The training
group’s web page: http://www.cuidadospaliativos.info/
*The work shall be sent out once the donation has been received. The name
of the generous sponsor will be made public.





The original
large scale work - only in this campaign and directly from the artist you have
the opportunity to be the owner of a murmur of the stones!



+ the
other 4 WORKS in PRINTED CECLÉE (value €
200 )
*If you are on mainland Spain, you will receive it
free of transport cost 
 There will be a SPECIAL
PERK for anybody who gets a patron at the level of ""ORIGINAL LARGE SCALE
MURMUR"" 





*Observation: 
We
are going to study, once all the perks of thanks and recognition have been sent
out, if it will be possible to “buy” or not, and at
what prices and under what conditions. 

Ideas and reasons why you will be
delighted to have one of the perks of thanks and recognition of the Murmur
   - to feel and to
know the difference between BEING A PATRON and not just a buyer of art.
    - to have in your home a work of art in which you have participated actively
from its creation through to the end, adding value to it and converting all the
process into YOUR OWN artistic experience.
    - afterwards you will be able to contemplate it with friends,
children, and relatives, in a quiet conversation on art, history, values or
places in the world.
    - serves as an
encouragement to undertake a trip (one can that mark or change your life) or to
remind you of something marvellous about Spain. 
    - to understand what
people are and used to be like and how hard they used to strive for truth in
the epoch when they still believed the earth was flat.
 
  - to delve deeper into learning and discovering new ideas on the history
of the university (as has been my case)
    - to come closer to
and discover an artist (I,
myself) and why not a friend? - start
by joining to Facebook.I’d be delighted!
     - to be more aware and
“awake” as one listens to the murmur of the stone (for wherever there is a stone
placed there is a good human intention), wherever you go, discovering new
places and experiences.
    - All of us have a person who is special to us and so
why not make them an original gift?

The Impact
With your support you are going to make
possible new ways of interpreting and spreading our universal artistic
heritage.
The fact that this is authentic, original and exotic art
that will never go out of fashion
is shown by the exclamations, notes of admiration and descriptions made
by travellers over time. This heritage
is the result of distinct cultures
living together over
centuries, leaving Spain with treasures
of an incalculable value. Spain is the third country in the world in
terms of the number of sites of heritage declared World Heritage of Humanity. However,
the works of the Murmur are anchored in their own specific places,
and only can be seen if you go to that place. And this is not always possible.
One must take into account that the original works chosen are on sites spread
out over Spain, sometimes where contemplating them implies one making a
strenuous effort (because of their placing or height), and they can only be
seen briefly – one is a tourist, and so above all they remain unknown to many people.
So for the first time we are going to
BRING these works of art CLOSER to everybody who wants to DISCOVER something
new. With this campaign for patrons it is possible to BRING ART TO PEOPLE IN
ALL THE WORLD.
These sculptures represent and transmit values
that are important for the history of our universe. 
Beyond
doubt this deepens our understanding and wisdom! 
It is a true visual pleasure to contemplate the works chosen, even
more so as they are extremely narrative and show the great beauty of plastic
art. The authentic face of the sculptured motifs are when they are seen in the
right light, and to get this effect in its full I have spent hours observing
them, an eye on the sky to capture them in their moments of finest splendour. 
We still do not know who were the authors of some of
the works, and the significance of others remain giving them an  enchanting
mystery, not yet de-coded. Each work casts its own spell, which leads some to believe that they all
bring good portents. The works were created as books of large pictures perfectly illustrating the people’s real character in each epoch over
history. By looking at them intently one can better perceive these enlightened
people, such as the great queen Isabel the Catholic, the emperor Carlo the Fifth (“the sun
never went down on his domains”), and discovers of the new world, such as Christopher Columbus, explorers like
Hernando de Magallanes,
great men of art like Diego Velázquez, Francisco de Goya, Miguel de
Cervantes and many other characters
who have survived over the centuries, and who have made their mark on history
and been worthy witness.  

Why
does this mean so much to me? 

In 1998 I had the honour and good
fortune to be the first artisan specialized in ornamental mural painting in the
Spanish region of Castilla and León, bring back this artisan’s craft.
Through my art I always try to
contribute to beauty and build on the important role classic art has today in
our modern world. 
COMMENTED ON IN
THE MEDIA


In a special way this project
is changing my life. The work put in over so many years is now bearing fruit,
as shown by the fact that one of the Murmur of the stones paintings won one of
the most relevant awards in a plastic arts competition in Castilla and León. Ver video


I feel it is rewarding to see a ""Murmur"" in
the entrance to the “Las Cortes de Castilla and León” (the
law courts). It is in perfect harmony and sits well with history, culture and
artistic tradition, and yet it is still modern. 
All of this, together with the
positive comments from across the spectrum make it worthwhile, gives me a push
to keep going, plus I am fortunate to be able to count on a great and supportive team.  This
keeps one feeling positive and keen to do my best
for this novel project in ""my
way"". 

Other ways in which you can help
We
know that not everybody can help economically, but another way to help us to
push forward is to be an AMBASSADOR of The Murmur of the stones, spread the word about our
project with friends and other people you meet. Use tools like INDIEGOGO or
other social media to share the news, simply copy and paste this link:

http://igg.me/at/El-murmullo-The-murmur/x/12848471

There is sure to be someone
somewhere who finds it interesting and they are going to be thankful to you.  
If you have any questions or suggestions,
or simply to encourage us in the project, please feel free to contact me at:

Risks and challenges


Life itself is a challenge and
so the biggest risk of missing out would be not
being bold enough to explore what brings passion and fun to life. 
Another danger would be to get
stuck in the past, enamoured with the works of sculpture as if they had to
remain in just one form of presentation. We are not limited to the sculptures
of the project. We want to go further and out of respect and admiration we want
to find a new way to discover the riches of these works.  
Everything comes together in
inviting you to join us on this project, and to be a witness of not simply what
we are going to do but also to feel how emotive it is, watching step by step as
we share this adventure with you .. So are you coming on board?

<h2>The Catalog of Paintings</h2>
<p><br/></p>
</div>

My series of nearly 200 water paintings is complete and I want to share it with you! <br/>To celebrate the completion of this body of work, I have assembled a one hundred and twelve page full color, hardcover 
catalog of a selection of my paintings from 2005 - 2014. <br/><br/>
<p>It all started in my bathtub one night as I noticed my skin was greener and the edges less clear underwater and I wondered if I could paint it. My curiosity grew as I experimented with different filters and materials.<b> I spent ten
years looking at flesh through water and translating it into paint.</b>  I have many stories of nearly drowning setting up some compositions, covering
my head in Vaseline (which didn't come out of my hair for weeks), and putting
flour in bathwater and floating oil on top to see what that would look like. There
was so much to see and play with in paint. A drop of water could be
three marks. A cloud of steam could obliterate the whole contour of a
cheek, leaving only clues of who was there and feeling what.</p>
<p>I was sensitive to whatever emotion showed up without forcing drama.
I was more interested in the subtlety of the an expression on its way
somewhere or just after something happened. And there, I could sense
my own vulnerability, sincere and un-obscured. <b>I
was observing what was there and taking it in, reflecting it back.</b> <br/></p>
<p>Painting is my place to understand what's going on
around me and inside me, a safe quiet world to myself
where I could feel, learn, craft and grow. <b>These
paintings are personal, honest, and each one holds a specific moment of
my life.</b>  <br/></p>
<p>After I put all the work together in a catalog, to read
the story from a distance, I
decided that I want to share it. And I know this is not just my story.</p>
<p>Painting is much more of a collaborative process than I
anticipated. I thought all this was just about me – but it is
heavily influenced by the situations, feelings, thoughts, fears, and ideas
that we all experience. <b>So I'm aware and so grateful for those in
my life who've affected me, encouraged and supported me, loved
me, believed in my vision, those who broke my heart, challenged me,
made me see the world and myself differently and, in doing so, helped me to make
these paintings. </b>It's all there. </p>I meant every stroke, every color, and every attempt to tell my
truth. I'll continue on and paint my next subject now. And this book will hold the memories of these paintings. <br/><h3><br/></h3>
<div> <p><b>What We Need and What You Will Receive:<br/></b></p>
<ul><b>
<li>With your help, we can do an initial print run of 1,000 books. If we do not reach our 
goal, we cannot print any catalogs and your contribution WILL BE REFUNDED. If we exceed our goal enough, however, we will be able to print another 1000 copies! Otherwise, any extra funding goes into painting my new series and more catalogs and exhibitions to come!<br/>
</li>
<li>The Catalog is laid out, edited and ready for press.<br/>
</li>
<li>We have selected our printer and have quotes according to our specs (below). Now all we need is you! </li>
<li>We expect the OIL AND WATER Catalog to ship out to IndieGoGo backers<b> by Spring 2016</b>. </li>
<li>All
 other perks, such as Giclee Prints and Small Paintings are available now, and will ship once the campaign is complete and funded. </li>

Challenges and Moving Forward
<ul>
<li>
I have put together a great team, and we've prepared as much as possible
 to make sure that this project runs smoothly. From this campaign, 
through the book design and production, to shipping out orders, we know 
what our next steps are and what deadlines we have to meet. We know this is a book 
people want, and we've done the research to make this a success.</li>

My series of nearly 200 water paintings is complete and I want to share it with you! To celebrate the completion of this body of work, I have assembled a one hundred and twelve page full color, hardcover 
catalog of a selection of my paintings from 2005 - 2014. 
It all started in my bathtub one night as I noticed my skin was greener and the edges less clear underwater and I wondered if I could paint it. My curiosity grew as I experimented with different filters and materials. I spent ten
years looking at flesh through water and translating it into paint.  I have many stories of nearly drowning setting up some compositions, covering
my head in Vaseline (which didn't come out of my hair for weeks), and putting
flour in bathwater and floating oil on top to see what that would look like. There
was so much to see and play with in paint. A drop of water could be
three marks. A cloud of steam could obliterate the whole contour of a
cheek, leaving only clues of who was there and feeling what.
I was sensitive to whatever emotion showed up without forcing drama.
I was more interested in the subtlety of the an expression on its way
somewhere or just after something happened. And there, I could sense
my own vulnerability, sincere and un-obscured. I
was observing what was there and taking it in, reflecting it back. 
Painting is my place to understand what's going on
around me and inside me, a safe quiet world to myself
where I could feel, learn, craft and grow. These
paintings are personal, honest, and each one holds a specific moment of
my life.  
After I put all the work together in a catalog, to read
the story from a distance, I
decided that I want to share it. And I know this is not just my story.
Painting is much more of a collaborative process than I
anticipated. I thought all this was just about me – but it is
heavily influenced by the situations, feelings, thoughts, fears, and ideas
that we all experience. So I'm aware and so grateful for those in
my life who've affected me, encouraged and supported me, loved
me, believed in my vision, those who broke my heart, challenged me,
made me see the world and myself differently and, in doing so, helped me to make
these paintings. It's all there. I meant every stroke, every color, and every attempt to tell my
truth. I'll continue on and paint my next subject now. And this book will hold the memories of these paintings. 
 What We Need and What You Will Receive:

With your help, we can do an initial print run of 1,000 books. If we do not reach our 
goal, we cannot print any catalogs and your contribution WILL BE REFUNDED. If we exceed our goal enough, however, we will be able to print another 1000 copies! Otherwise, any extra funding goes into painting my new series and more catalogs and exhibitions to come!

The Catalog is laid out, edited and ready for press.

We have selected our printer and have quotes according to our specs (below). Now all we need is you! 
We expect the OIL AND WATER Catalog to ship out to IndieGoGo backers by Spring 2016. 
All
 other perks, such as Giclee Prints and Small Paintings are available now, and will ship once the campaign is complete and funded. 


Challenges and Moving Forward


I have put together a great team, and we've prepared as much as possible
 to make sure that this project runs smoothly. From this campaign, 
through the book design and production, to shipping out orders, we know 
what our next steps are and what deadlines we have to meet. We know this is a book 
people want, and we've done the research to make this a success.
We do not have an advertising budget, so we're relying on grassroots word-of-mouth. Please tell your friends to visit and share

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are a train buff, a lover of history, or Philadelphian, learning about the Main Line will fascinate you.  Since 2010 I have photographed and handcrafted PicBricks of the Main Line.  Now I want to make these works of art available to everyone.  Remember PicBrick film can be used on ANY masonry surface. Don’t let the name fool you, PicBrick film can decorate almost ANY wall! Bricks are just one popular surface.</p>
<p>The Historic Main Line of Philadelphia dates to the late 1820’s. Back then it was known as the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad. Passengers took the steam train all the way to the old Pennsylvania Canal. Now this line is internationally famous. The route is so entrenched in modern culture that the Philadelphia suburbs are simply known as the Main Line. These beautiful train stations stretch from rural Thorndale, Pennsylvania, all the way to busy downtown Suburban Station. Included in the set is not only the oldest train station in Philadelphia but in all of North America! This Greek Rival station dates back to 1834.</p>
<p>PicBrick film is a revolutionary material that when heated melts into any masonry surface. Any image can become a work of art.  I choose to use bricks as they make great doorstops, table centerpieces, and paperweights. To apply it is an easy three step process which adheres the film to bricks, slate, basement walls, and more. Any clean masonry surface can become your canvas. Cinderblock walls look great with the larger mancave posters turning ordinary walls into murals.</p>
<p>I need your help to print the entire Main Line Collection. In order to print these impressions economically we must reach critical mass printing levels.  Donations start at just one dollar and go all the way up to the Full Main Line Gold Set.</p>

<div>
<p>•The bare minimum to print out the first run will be $3,650 dollars. Any money past this goal will allow me to market and educate a larger crowd.</p>
<p>•Funding will be used for PicBrick material, UV resistant ink, bricks, packaging, and glossy paint.</p>
<p>•There are a lot of great rewards to choose. Look to the right for all the options. Remember you can apply this material to more than bricks.</p>
<p>Each station comes with its history and milepost number on the reverse side. I want everyone to create, play, and learn about the Main Line. Making these works of art will be a great way for kids and adults to create and work together.</p>
<p>Preserving and sharing the history of these elegant landmarks is my ultimate goal.</p>

Included in the set is not only the oldest train station in Philadelphia but in all of North America! This Greek Rival station dates back to 1834.
PicBrick film is a revolutionary material that when heated melts into any masonry surface. Any image can become a work of art.  I choose to use bricks as they make great doorstops, table centerpieces, and paperweights. To apply it is an easy three step process which adheres the film to bricks, slate, basement walls, and more. Any clean masonry surface can become your canvas. Cinderblock walls look great with the larger mancave posters turning ordinary walls into murals.
I need your help to print the entire Main Line Collection. In order to print these impressions economically we must reach critical mass printing levels.  Donations start at just one dollar and go all the way up to the Full Main Line Gold Set.
 


•The bare minimum to print out the first run will be $3,650 dollars. Any money past this goal will allow me to market and educate a larger crowd.
•Funding will be used for PicBrick material, UV resistant ink, bricks, packaging, and glossy paint.
•There are a lot of great rewards to choose. Look to the right for all the options. Remember you can apply this material to more than bricks.
Each station comes with its history and milepost number on the reverse side. I want everyone to create, play, and learn about the Main Line. Making these works of art will be a great way for kids and adults to create and work together.
Preserving and sharing the history of these elegant landmarks is my ultimate goal.
              
 
   
       















 


Other Ways You Can Help
I understand everyone is not in the position to donate financially, so please send this site to 10 other train buffs, history lovers, or collectors.  I can only reach the printing goal with your support and the support of the community.  If you like this project, please show your friends.
Please spread the word.

(Steve@hub-bub.com)<br/><h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Each year, HUB-BUB Artists-in-Residence leave something behind for the HUB-BUB permanent collection before they go. I'm Steve Snell, a current resident, and I want to leave behind something that can be shared beyond the walls of HUB-BUB to become a literal part of the vision of Spartanburg. The idea is to fill the old garage door on the south side of the HUB-BUB building, which once served as the showroom for the old Nash car dealership and currently sits derelict and vacant, with the image of a photographed palmetto tree. The intention is to add life to a part of the building and the surrounding Grain District, which has the potential to become a public arts centerpiece for the city. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The mural will be completed by March 29, 2012 and will be unveiled at the Artists-in-Residence Exit Show that day. Help us to raise the money to realize this vision!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Public art is an important element for any city. Currently, HUB-BUB boasts and hosts the enormous graffiti wall, which draws hundreds of viewers to this area of the city each year. A block away is the Hub City Art Park, which provides installation and sculpture for public enjoyment. This mural will add to the creative climate of Spartanburg, bringing even more color and vitality to this area, which has the potential to become the public art center of the city. Help HUB-BUB draw attention to an often overlooked area of the Grain District and build this public art palmetto!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All donations will be used to buy paint, plywood, epoxy, brushes, tape and any other material needed to create this painting. The mural will be 11 2/3 ft. wide by 14 ft. high, containing approximately 5,796 individually painted squares of solid color. What you get is a life-size image of a palmetto tree that is formed much the way an image comes together on computer. With your help, this tree will come to life!</p>
</div><div>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>
                Happydog Performance Company and Frei Designs, come 
together once again to present an evening of art, fashion, and 
performance at the Packer Schopf Gallery in Chicago, Illinois.  This gallery presentation, for one night only, comments on the vast array of options women have to pave the way for the next generations' would-have-been wives, life-partners, and baby-makers.  They don't want to adhere to the traditional stages of adulthood, and yet, they're caught between the old and the new.  This evening event, is a nod to the next wave of feminism where women not only want their cake, but eat it too.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Details</h3>This work will be presented for one night only and it's FREE!  The production costs for this work far exceed our goal of $1,000, but we would love to cover the cost for this performance first, which includes paying our performers and buying our materials, including fabric.  We are creating a 3-hour experience where the visual is married to the performance; the work exists on the performers and we could not mimic the work without them.  We have 7 performers, 1 sound designer, 1 photographer, 1 videographer, 2
 choreographers, 1 designer, 3 directors, 1 stylist/designer, and about 
104 yards of fabric to make this show.  And did I mention it's a free show and  open to the public?  So please help us make the work, literally, come alive.  Your support will make this a night to remember.  We are eternally grateful for your support and we hope the small tokens of our affection for this campaign represent a mere fraction of our gratitude.     <br/>

			established in 1994 to rescue principallyorchids,
			secondarily other epiphytes,
			which were being dumped and burned as garbage in the process of
			burning and clearing the forests: or were being removed for
			illegal commercial sales, or abandoned in the process as selling
			these plants is a Federal offence. Craig

<p>Hello, my name is Aaron Mostow, a 30 year artist, musician and inventor from Los Angeles.  The inspiration for ""Prspectv"" came from a dream and vision I had to create a giant pair of sunglasses.  Not just any sunglasses, the iconic retro sunglasses from my childhood memories in the late 1980's.  As ideas began flowing and new innovative technologies started hitting media platforms, I began realizing, not only could this be a cool piece of art for people to look at, but also to interact with.  The sunglasses stretch over 5 feet in length and they are a sight to see in person.  With your help, my goal is to have ""Prspectv"" featured and on display at select music festivals, sporting events, conventions, galleries and museums all around the world, for people of all ages to enjoy.  Seeing the look of smiling faces and people interacting with ""Prspectv"" would be a dream come true.</p>

<p>-Purchase 2 projector bulbs</p>
<p>-Purchase an Xbox Kinect to add motion detection and tracking, making the eye's on ""Prspectv"" reactive to people's movement</p>

In fact, my handwriting in primary school was unreadable. When I was 12, I received one Christmas card from my cousin. She had such amazingly beautiful handwriting. Simply, I got jealous and just started to practice right away, at first by imitating her handwriting. So my very first calligraphy practice was writing “Merry Christmas” countless times.</p><p>Since then, I began to develop my skill, and to learn more different styles through books and internet. I couldn’t help practicing it, especially when I was in class, taking note from lessons, or writing essays. Once I was caught by a teacher. I was taking note in Gothic style during her lesson . Of course, I didn’t follow the whole lesson, and the note was so empty enough for her to start telling me off in front of the class. I couldn’t recall all the bitter words, but something about “distracting and useless”. The best is yet to come, afterward she complained to my parent how distracted I was in her class, and that “the useless flowery writing habit is up to no good”. The young innocent love ended right there bitterly when I was 15.</p><p>Until last month, when I was in “Basic in graphic design” class, my amazing teacher Sarah Jane-Leavey showed us a video clip of Seb Lester – a famous calligrapher in UK. ( that’s also how the word calligraphy, and the title calligrapher was added to my vocabulary ). I was thinking to myself “oh god, this is what I had been always doing, so It is an Art and people earn a living from it???” Sure, they do and at the end of the day it was not  “useless” AT ALL. After school, I went directly to stationery store, bought a couple of calligraphy pens, and a calligraphy sketchbook, then started practicing right on that night. I was quite not so satisfied, I came back to the stationery the following day, bought a bunch of nib pens, filt-nib pens, calligraphy markers, and brushes ( try not to think about the prices). Trying all the technique I used to do, with a proper pen and paper, surprisingly, the skill came back to me so naturally. A revenge-idea crossed my mind, "" I must prove the world that Calligraphy is not useless-at-all"" ( in case, some of them still think so or being forced to think so). Then, I almost immediately linked it with my handmade  greeting-cards making hobby, and came up with this project. I’ve been working non-stop in less than a month creating calligraphy, filming, telling my story, and editing the video ,just to get all of this ready before November. Therefore, the Christmas cards can reach everyone before Christmas.</p><p>To conclude this, I do hope that this story means something to you, and that if you ever had a dream, a “love affair” with something/someone, keep making your dream comes true, keep fighting for love. It’s ways beyond satisfying, its fulfilling and rewarding. Cheers!</p><br/><h1>The Impact:</h1><p>Thanks to your support, I can work more on my calligraphy which I couldn’t do much (because of the expensive cost of materials here). A package of 5 Sakura pens, and 10 pieces of calligraphy papers already cost over 50 euro. To have one calligraphy work done, I have to sketch a lot and usually have to use up a complete un-fillable pen with lots of paper. As practicing more, I’ll improve my skill, and hopefully no need to sketch that much anymore, hence I can save the materials.</p><p>I’m eager to have my calligraphy exhibited in Helsinki Art and Craft fair 2014. I missed this year, because the cost of exhibition stand and delivery cost was out –of-student budget. Therefore, this fund will help me afford the expense for next exhibition in 2014. </p><p>This will be a turning point in my life. Thanks to your supports, I step one step closer to be a professional calligrapher.

<h2><br/></h2></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","My story:  I’m 22 years old a product design student in Kymenlaakson University of Applied Sciences, Finland.  I am in a love affair with Calligraphy but the love story seems not so easy.I was not born with a magical hand. In fact, my handwriting in primary school was unreadable. When I was 12, I received one Christmas card from my cousin. She had such amazingly beautiful handwriting. Simply, I got jealous and just started to practice right away, at first by imitating her handwriting. So my very first calligraphy practice was writing “Merry Christmas” countless times.Since then, I began to develop my skill, and to learn more different styles through books and internet. I couldn’t help practicing it, especially when I was in class, taking note from lessons, or writing essays. Once I was caught by a teacher. I was taking note in Gothic style during her lesson . Of course, I didn’t follow the whole lesson, and the note was so empty enough for her to start telling me off in front of the class. I couldn’t recall all the bitter words, but something about “distracting and useless”. The best is yet to come, afterward she complained to my parent how distracted I was in her class, and that “the useless flowery writing habit is up to no good”. The young innocent love ended right there bitterly when I was 15.Until last month, when I was in “Basic in graphic design” class, my amazing teacher Sarah Jane-Leavey showed us a video clip of Seb Lester – a famous calligrapher in UK. ( that’s also how the word calligraphy, and the title calligrapher was added to my vocabulary ). I was thinking to myself “oh god, this is what I had been always doing, so It is an Art and people earn a living from it???” Sure, they do and at the end of the day it was not  “useless” AT ALL. After school, I went directly to stationery store, bought a couple of calligraphy pens, and a calligraphy sketchbook, then started practicing right on that night. I was quite not so satisfied, I came back to the stationery the following day, bought a bunch of nib pens, filt-nib pens, calligraphy markers, and brushes ( try not to think about the prices). Trying all the technique I used to do, with a proper pen and paper, surprisingly, the skill came back to me so naturally. A revenge-idea crossed my mind, "" I must prove the world that Calligraphy is not useless-at-all"" ( in case, some of them still think so or being forced to think so). Then, I almost immediately linked it with my handmade  greeting-cards making hobby, and came up with this project. I’ve been working non-stop in less than a month creating calligraphy, filming, telling my story, and editing the video ,just to get all of this ready before November. Therefore, the Christmas cards can reach everyone before Christmas.To conclude this, I do hope that this story means something to you, and that if you ever had a dream, a “love affair” with something/someone, keep making your dream comes true, keep fighting for love. It’s ways beyond satisfying, its fulfilling and rewarding. Cheers!The Impact:Thanks to your support, I can work more on my calligraphy which I couldn’t do much (because of the expensive cost of materials here). A package of 5 Sakura pens, and 10 pieces of calligraphy papers already cost over 50 euro. To have one calligraphy work done, I have to sketch a lot and usually have to use up a complete un-fillable pen with lots of paper. As practicing more, I’ll improve my skill, and hopefully no need to sketch that much anymore, hence I can save the materials.I’m eager to have my calligraphy exhibited in Helsinki Art and Craft fair 2014. I missed this year, because the cost of exhibition stand and delivery cost was out –of-student budget. Therefore, this fund will help me afford the expense for next exhibition in 2014. This will be a turning point in my life. Thanks to your supports, I step one step closer to be a professional calligrapher. The greater goal is to organize regular courses for people in town who are interested in calligraphy, especially children.

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Discrimination is a global concern and is a catalyst to many of the societal indecencies that plague the world. Most of the wars and civil outcries are on the basis of a fundamental discrimination, from the Holocaust to the Rwandan genocide. Think of the last time that you were treated differently because of your gender, religion, race or ability. Through the art of discrimination project we hope to showcase the triumphs of the people who have overcome their situation, to inspire others to have the courage and the tools to challenge discrimination and as a voice for each of us to be aware of our behaviour and the way we treat others and to create the space for others to do the same.</p>

<p>Any time Stanford students or alumni meet for the first time the first question they ask is ‘what year are you?’  Stanford students in the same class year share a special bond, more so than at most schools, and that class year pride lasts a lifetime.</p>
<p>The Class Diamond is one of the most cherished images of the Stanford experience because it is your identity at Stanford social events, reunions and tailgates, and it indicates the best part of the Stanford Magazine: the Class Notes. Now, for the first time ever, you can represent your class with your very own hand made sterling silver Class Diamond collectible from Collegiate Silver.</p>
<p>All Class Diamond products are designed and hand made by Waddie CrazyHorse, Stanford '10.  Waddie uses a blend of modern technological and “old school” hand-wrought techniques. Being a 3rd-generation Native American silversmith, jewelry design runs in Waddie’s family history, and he enjoys honoring the heritage he has been blessed with. The quality of hand made jewelry and the attention to detail distinguishes Collegiate Silver’s jewelry line as not just another logo product, but one that is appropriate for the Stanford University community. Collegiate Silver’s class diamond products look just like the class diamonds lining the walkway of the Quad at Stanford University. The Class Diamond will be instantly recognizable by any student or alumnus.</p>
<p>When you pre-order your Class Diamond, your money goes directly to the production costs that will make this project happen: purchasing special tooling to make the class diamonds and materials like injectable wax, high-quality plaster, oxy-acetylene and of course, sterling silver casting grain. A successful fundraising campaign will help Collegiate Silver achieve so much in 2013, including the debut of Stanford graduation rings and a successful expansion to similar products for Cal, USC, and UCLA. Please remember that every dollar helps, and that even if you cannot pledge, please share this page with friends, family and any Stanford supporters you may know.</p>

<p>In November 2012 independent curator Zeina Assaf will be presenting a two-person exhibition entitled Lithic Habitats, created by emerging artists, Rose Nestler and Robin Stein, at the nonprofit CUCHIFRITOS Gallery and Project Space in Manhattan.<br/><br/><strong>Lithic Habitats</strong> explores the landscape of the American West, as well as the intersection of natural architectural forms with man-made structures. Humans have long elevated natural rock formations to iconic status; they have become our sacred destinations for pilgrimage and exploration, at times even symbols of national and state identity. Yet in our modern times these awe-inspiring, natural landscapes are often contrasted with the weathered, man-made buildings that now seem to interrupt them. Lithic Habitats encourages its viewers to reconsider their relationship to traditionally American landscapes and opens a dialog about the reverence, adventure, and refuge that can be found in natural land.<br/><br/><strong>Rose Nestler’s</strong> installation emulates the hue surface similarities between lavishly upholstered objects and smooth undulating rock forms. She has re-interpreted these sublime spaces on an intimate scale, and through her choice of materials, comments on the idea of the feminine and mysterious in nature. Constructed with hand-upholstered cushions in luxurious fabrics, referencing 19th century aesthetic style and craftsmanship of decorative objects the installation fills the gallery space forcing viewers to explore and touch their crowded expanses and cavernous corners, creating a small maze not unlike the Essex Street market itself. This uncharted landscape inside the gallery would be in contrast to the well-known Lower East Side and within the sanctity of the installation, participants experience an immersive, tactile and momentary respite from the outside urban environment.<br/><br/>In contrast to Nestler’s installation are <strong>Robin Stein’s</strong> photographs of stark dwellings dotting the desert landscape, whose residents are utilizing the land as a habitat, albeit its hostile and unyielding characteristics. This series examines the idea of frontier and changing landscapes, interrupted by man. Taken predominantly in largely isolated towns in the West, these images examine a different kind of exploration and haven within the land itself.<br/><br/>Nestler and Stein have collaborated on the installation’s audio: a collection of contrasting environmental sounds sourced from both the rural west and the streets of Manhattan’s Lower East Side. The audio will be be mounted inside a cavernous stack of Nestler’s cushions, causing viewers to stop and investigate the source of sound.<br/><br/></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Artist and Curator Bios</h3>
<p><strong>Rose Nestler</strong> currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York where she is a residing artist at a Chashama Studio Program in the Brooklyn Army Terminal. Through installation, drawing, and sculpture Nestler develops spaces that are illusionary yet familiar.  Themes of historical architecture, ornamental objects and untamed natural landscapes create the formal basis for her works.  Nestler received a BA in Fine Arts and Art History from Mt. Holyoke College in 2005 and now works as a Teaching Artist. Her work has been exhibited in the New York area at a variety of galleries and community organizations including, NY Studio Gallery, Arts @ Renaissance, International Studio and Curatorial Program, Proteus Gowanus and the NARS Foundation.  Nestler has been an artist-in-residence at Vermont Studio Center, Supporting Women Artists Project and Byrdcliffe Artists Colony.<br/><br/><strong>Robin Stein</strong> is a multi-disciplinary artist based in Seattle, WA.  Primarily working with photography, moving images and sound, his work is rooted in an inquisitive and adventurous exploration of geography, history, and human interactions with the built and natural landscape.  His photography, installations and music have been recognized and exhibited widely, having shown in venues in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Mexico City, Seattle, and Portland.<br/><br/><strong>Zeina Assaf</strong> is an arts administrator, independent curator and artist living and working in Beirut, Lebanon. Curating emerging to mid-career artists since 2006 at both non-profit and commercial spaces such as Cuchifritos Gallery/Project Space, artHARLEM, and NY Studio Gallery. She is currently working at 98weeks Research/ Project space.  <br/><br/><br/></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">What We Need</h3>
<p>Lithic Habitats is scheduled to open on November 10th and run through December 9th, 2012.  At this time CUCHIFRITOS is unable to offer a stipend to artists. Funds are needed in order to complete Nestler’s hand-upholstered sculptural forms consisting of 6 stacks of cushions ranging from 4-9' tall.  Funds raised will also go toward the framing/printing of Stein’s photographs, as well as, the audio equipment for the installation. The execution of Nestler’s sculptural forms requires many steps, including: screenprinting the fabric, cutting out the foam and wooden shapes, sewing the slipcovers, and upholstering the cushions.  Additional funds will be needed during installation of the exhibit to transport the sculptures from Nestler’s studio to the gallery. <br/><br/>We are requesting $2,750, which is approximately half the cost of the total budget for the project.  100% of the funds that we raise will go to this project and will help pay for, the fabric, fabric printing, wood, foam, tools, transportation, as well as the framing and printing of the photographs.  <br/><br/></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">How Your Contribution Helps</h3>
<p>Receiving funds from supporting donors would be an invaluable addition toward achieving our project goals. This exhibition marks a pivotal point in both Nestler and Stein’s artistic careers; it is their first solo show following numerous prior group shows.

<p>120 Essex Street (Inside the Essex Street Market)<br/>New York, NY <br/><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.3447724487632513""><br/></strong></p></div>","Project Description
In November 2012 independent curator Zeina Assaf will be presenting a two-person exhibition entitled Lithic Habitats, created by emerging artists, Rose Nestler and Robin Stein, at the nonprofit CUCHIFRITOS Gallery and Project Space in Manhattan.Lithic Habitats explores the landscape of the American West, as well as the intersection of natural architectural forms with man-made structures. Humans have long elevated natural rock formations to iconic status; they have become our sacred destinations for pilgrimage and exploration, at times even symbols of national and state identity. Yet in our modern times these awe-inspiring, natural landscapes are often contrasted with the weathered, man-made buildings that now seem to interrupt them. Lithic Habitats encourages its viewers to reconsider their relationship to traditionally American landscapes and opens a dialog about the reverence, adventure, and refuge that can be found in natural land.Rose Nestler’s installation emulates the hue surface similarities between lavishly upholstered objects and smooth undulating rock forms. She has re-interpreted these sublime spaces on an intimate scale, and through her choice of materials, comments on the idea of the feminine and mysterious in nature. Constructed with hand-upholstered cushions in luxurious fabrics, referencing 19th century aesthetic style and craftsmanship of decorative objects the installation fills the gallery space forcing viewers to explore and touch their crowded expanses and cavernous corners, creating a small maze not unlike the Essex Street market itself. This uncharted landscape inside the gallery would be in contrast to the well-known Lower East Side and within the sanctity of the installation, participants experience an immersive, tactile and momentary respite from the outside urban environment.In contrast to Nestler’s installation are Robin Stein’s photographs of stark dwellings dotting the desert landscape, whose residents are utilizing the land as a habitat, albeit its hostile and unyielding characteristics. This series examines the idea of frontier and changing landscapes, interrupted by man. Taken predominantly in largely isolated towns in the West, these images examine a different kind of exploration and haven within the land itself.Nestler and Stein have collaborated on the installation’s audio: a collection of contrasting environmental sounds sourced from both the rural west and the streets of Manhattan’s Lower East Side. The audio will be be mounted inside a cavernous stack of Nestler’s cushions, causing viewers to stop and investigate the source of sound.
Artist and Curator Bios
Rose Nestler currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York where she is a residing artist at a Chashama Studio Program in the Brooklyn Army Terminal. Through installation, drawing, and sculpture Nestler develops spaces that are illusionary yet familiar.  Themes of historical architecture, ornamental objects and untamed natural landscapes create the formal basis for her works.  Nestler received a BA in Fine Arts and Art History from Mt. Holyoke College in 2005 and now works as a Teaching Artist. Her work has been exhibited in the New York area at a variety of galleries and community organizations including, NY Studio Gallery, Arts @ Renaissance, International Studio and Curatorial Program, Proteus Gowanus and the NARS Foundation.  Nestler has been an artist-in-residence at Vermont Studio Center, Supporting Women Artists Project and Byrdcliffe Artists Colony.Robin Stein is a multi-disciplinary artist based in Seattle, WA.  Primarily working with photography, moving images and sound, his work is rooted in an inquisitive and adventurous exploration of geography, history, and human interactions with the built and natural landscape.  His photography, installations and music have been recognized and exhibited widely, having shown in venues in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Mexico City, Seattle, and Portland.Zeina Assaf is an arts administrator, independent curator and artist living and working in Beirut, Lebanon. Curating emerging to mid-career artists since 2006 at both non-profit and commercial spaces such as Cuchifritos Gallery/Project Space, artHARLEM, and NY Studio Gallery. She is currently working at 98weeks Research/ Project space.  
What We Need
Lithic Habitats is scheduled to open on November 10th and run through December 9th, 2012.  At this time CUCHIFRITOS is unable to offer a stipend to artists. Funds are needed in order to complete Nestler’s hand-upholstered sculptural forms consisting of 6 stacks of cushions ranging from 4-9' tall.  Funds raised will also go toward the framing/printing of Stein’s photographs, as well as, the audio equipment for the installation. The execution of Nestler’s sculptural forms requires many steps, including: screenprinting the fabric, cutting out the foam and wooden shapes, sewing the slipcovers, and upholstering the cushions.  Additional funds will be needed during installation of the exhibit to transport the sculptures from Nestler’s studio to the gallery. We are requesting $2,750, which is approximately half the cost of the total budget for the project.  100% of the funds that we raise will go to this project and will help pay for, the fabric, fabric printing, wood, foam, tools, transportation, as well as the framing and printing of the photographs.  
How Your Contribution Helps
Receiving funds from supporting donors would be an invaluable addition toward achieving our project goals. This exhibition marks a pivotal point in both Nestler and Stein’s artistic careers; it is their first solo show following numerous prior group shows. It provides the opportunity for recognition and to showcase a seminal body of work in a gallery setting. In return we are offering many perks toward your generosity and support.  Some perks include, prints of the fabric design, Stein’s framed photographs from the show, a private screenprinting lesson, a wall drawing in your home or business, homemade pies, and a basket of wild mushrooms!

<p>It all started back on the 26<sup>th </sup>of November 2011...</p>
<p>After having dinner at Sumo Lounge with friends, Rob Dodds walked through the Eau Claire Mall noticed a large (and empty) potential gallery space.</p>
<p>Rob had been doing one night art shows and was looking for long term exposure. In the back of his mind he was constantly looking for a gallery space that could offer him just that. This space sparked an interest and seemed like it might be the perfect place!</p>
<p>After contemplating the price to rent the gallery space at Eau Claire and realizing that he had nothing to lose in just asking, he finally arranged to meet with Eau Claire's property Management 2 days later.</p>
<p>Harvard Management loved the idea and gave Rob an amazing deal.</p>
<p>The name Motion Gallery was created with the idea of Newton's theory of motion where ""Objects in motion stay in motion"", the Gallery's motto is not far off ""Artists in motion stay in motion"".</p>
<p>In realizing the massive space of the gallery and the amount of artwork it would need to fill the space, Rob invited all his artist friends and additionally put out the question on Facebook. ""Anyone got artwork they want to hang in a new gallery in Eau Claire?Bring your artwork down"".</p>
<p>The overwhelming response was astonishing!!! Everyone loved the idea. He was getting +50 messages and comments on Facebook daily.</p>
<p>When it came to the deadline, 21 Artists brought in artwork and committed to displaying their works that first month. </p>
<p>The popularity of the gallery was not foreseen and Rob decided he would 'see how it goes'.</p>
<p>The opening day party was on the 9th December 2011.　</p>
<p>With the great response from all the Artists and visitors to the gallery in that first month, Rob decided to continue having the gallery opened into January 2012. Then February, then March …and so on.</p>
<p>With a buy-in of only $50 per month and a 15% commission taken by the gallery for artwork sold the popularity of the gallery for artists of all mediums has only increased. After 10 months, the gallery was holding works from 44 artists and boasts a waiting list of over 50 artists wanting to get their work displayed.</p>

Story of Motion Gallery
It all started back on the 26th of November 2011...
After having dinner at Sumo Lounge with friends, Rob Dodds walked through the Eau Claire Mall noticed a large (and empty) potential gallery space.
Rob had been doing one night art shows and was looking for long term exposure. In the back of his mind he was constantly looking for a gallery space that could offer him just that. This space sparked an interest and seemed like it might be the perfect place!
After contemplating the price to rent the gallery space at Eau Claire and realizing that he had nothing to lose in just asking, he finally arranged to meet with Eau Claire's property Management 2 days later.
Harvard Management loved the idea and gave Rob an amazing deal.
The name Motion Gallery was created with the idea of Newton's theory of motion where ""Objects in motion stay in motion"", the Gallery's motto is not far off ""Artists in motion stay in motion"".
In realizing the massive space of the gallery and the amount of artwork it would need to fill the space, Rob invited all his artist friends and additionally put out the question on Facebook. ""Anyone got artwork they want to hang in a new gallery in Eau Claire?Bring your artwork down"".
The overwhelming response was astonishing!!! Everyone loved the idea. He was getting +50 messages and comments on Facebook daily.
When it came to the deadline, 21 Artists brought in artwork and committed to displaying their works that first month. 
The popularity of the gallery was not foreseen and Rob decided he would 'see how it goes'.
The opening day party was on the 9th December 2011.　
With the great response from all the Artists and visitors to the gallery in that first month, Rob decided to continue having the gallery opened into January 2012. Then February, then March …and so on.
With a buy-in of only $50 per month and a 15% commission taken by the gallery for artwork sold the popularity of the gallery for artists of all mediums has only increased. After 10 months, the gallery was holding works from 44 artists and boasts a waiting list of over 50 artists wanting to get their work displayed.
Being able to show how many members/supporters we have behind us helps us have a better chance of getting grant money which will help the gallery be able to promote more events, pay people working in the gallery for the time they put into making it run smoothly and eventually expand in many other directions.

<h2 class=""p1""><strong>THE PROJECT AND THE CONCEPT </strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">At home is a series of photographies exploring places where I feel at home.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I choose to photograph this places because they make me feel well, safe, comfortable and protected. Usually they are known places where a strong emotional connection has been established through the experiences lived there.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The framing is done in the direction to the house where I was born and raised. This orientation is found with the support of maps, GPS and compass.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This process creates a dialog in between the images. They share the common idea of “home” or “being at home” and gets a double meaning: the tender “home” where the image is captured and the physical “home” where I grew up that is at the far end in the direction expressed by the framing of the image.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The title of each image correspond to the values of the azimuth and distance from the photographed place to the house where I was born.</span></p>

I choose to photograph this places because they make me feel well, safe, comfortable and protected. Usually they are known places where a strong emotional connection has been established through the experiences lived there.
The framing is done in the direction to the house where I was born and raised. This orientation is found with the support of maps, GPS and compass.
This process creates a dialog in between the images. They share the common idea of “home” or “being at home” and gets a double meaning: the tender “home” where the image is captured and the physical “home” where I grew up that is at the far end in the direction expressed by the framing of the image.
The title of each image correspond to the values of the azimuth and distance from the photographed place to the house where I was born.

<p>The 402 Arts Collective is on a mission ""to create and cultivate a vibrant network of artists who are committed to impacting the culture and serving the community.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We have spent the past three years offering music lessons at various locations and supplementing public school curriculum and budgets with our instructors.  <span>There were classes</span><span> scattered about the city with s</span>matterings of students, artists, and musicians here and there.  </p>
<p>But we have discovered that a physical building matters.  It’s not just the concept of art.  It’s not just the creation of music, but a place for this to happen.  </p>
<p>Consequently, the 402 is renovating a historic building in the Benson neighborhood in the heart of Omaha’s music scene.  The upstairs restoration of this beautiful space is almost complete with lesson studios, meeting room, and a recording studio.</p>
<p>The construction of the main level has also begun for an all-ages music venue nestled alongside Aromas Coffeehouse.  The building will provide space for local musicians to perform, artists to display their work, and the community to gather.  It turns out, however, that old buildings have surprises.  </p>
<p><span>Not just the good kind, but </span>also the sagging-ceilings-with-fire-and-accessibility-codes-that-are-sorely-outdated-kind.</p>
<p><span>So here we are, asking the community to help us finish a space that we will gladly return to you.  Because, you see, the 402 is driven by the affiliation of artists that both instruct and learn in the collective, but it is also invested in the community of Benson as a whole.  It will be a space to meet the neighbors, and have business meetings and study groups, and attend art showings, and support local bands.  The 402 will not just foster the arts but expose the the broader community to them.  </span>   </p>
<p>The need is still great.                                                                        </p>
<p>We can meet it together.  </p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>The price tag of renovating the Benson venue/coffeehouse/lesson studio/art gallery space is $250,000.            </p>
<p>Jaw-dropping, right?  </p>
<p>The good news is that over half of that money has already been donated by some wildly generous people.  It is because of them that construction has already begun on this building on the corner of 60th Avenue and Maple.  Those funds have gone to reinforce the ceiling and floor, install a fire suppression system, wheelchair ramps, electrical, plumbing, and drywall as well as restore the storefront to its former glory. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We have multiple fundraisers planned to help finish the space.</p>
<p>This is one of them.</p>
<p>Your donation will go toward things like refinishing the 100-year-old hardwood floors, installing the updated tin ceiling tiles that were pain-stakingly removed by volunteers, painting and tiling and adding luxuries like toilets and an HVAC system.  Your generosity will make this space ready to be occupied by the end of September.  </p>
<p>That's right.  This is the final stretch, folks.  We promise.  This isn't one of those projects that you pour into while wishing upon a star that your money multiplies or the end goal will be met by the time your children's children's children come along.  We just need your help to finish the space.  We're so close.   </p>
<p>To show our gratitude (and because this is kind of just how Indiegogo works), we would like to offer some thank you notes of sort for you donations.  Listed to the right are some perks that we would like to offer for your generosity.  The beauty of operating an art house is that we can provide some really incredible incentives.  Original music and one-of-a-kind drawings and lessons and concerts and whatnot.  Take a look!</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>The 402 is already doing so many great things including the following programs:</p>
<p><strong>Lesson Studios</strong><span>: The lesson studios are dedicated to providing high quality music and art education in many disciplines. Because The 402 is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization, it can operate in a charitable sense to the community. The goal is to provide affordable lessons to as many people as possible, providing scholarships to the under-served as the organization continues to grow.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>402 Rock Academy</strong><span>: This eight-week program combines students that are already proficient on an instrument with other musicians.  With the help of a mentor, these students learn to play as part of a band, develop their musicianship, and perform at the end of each semester at a concert that is open to the public.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Arts Education Connection</strong><span>: This process provides arts education to public, private, and home schools across the Omaha area to supplement the consistently downsized curriculum. The 402 is currently serving Norris Middle School, Morton Middle School, and Elkhorn South High School.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""> <strong>Performance Venue (coming soon)</strong><span>: Having an actual performance venue will expand the type of education and exposure that The 402 can currently administer to students.  An all-ages performance venue and coffeehouse will provide a stage and gallery space for developing artists to begin displaying their craft.  This honor will only be available to students of an excellent caliber which also provides incentive to grow and improve.  </span></p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Please know that even $5 at a time will really add up over the next 30 days, but we also realize that not everyone will be able to contribute financially to this campaign.  News about our little nonprofit is still getting out, so if you could help by championing our efforts and talking about the 402 project and spreading the word, that would be incredibly helpful as well.  There is even a handy ""share"" option on this very campaign.  If you could spread the word through social media, we would really like that.  Facebook, Twitter, Instragram, Google+, LinkedIn, MySpace, digital carrier pigeons, etc...</p>
<p>We hope to meet you in the real life very soon.</p>

<p>We have been able to raise part of the funds privately and can now lower the support required on Indiegogo considerably. We are closer to the release and will be ready to deliver by February already!</p>
<p>What a better release date for us than the Valentine's day!?</p>
<p>Secure your unique present for your loved ones, have fun !</p>
<h2>What's Perphone?</h2>
<p>Perphone is a fashion and fragrance accessory, designed around the only object that we carry always: our smartphones. Not only is it fashionable, but it also comes to one’s rescue in daily situations.</p>
<p>Perphone is the perfect gadget- it can be paired and matched with whatever you are wearing, can be used by everyone in all situations, and it is ideal whenever a quick refreshment is needed before a business meeting, a date, when traveling, or simply to regain a comfortable feeling. We all need to be continuously refreshed throughout the day, every day.</p>
<p>We aim to replace the old-fashioned, rarely used 2-ml. testers we are given by famous brands with our new containers. They are small, light, and attached to your phone, which ensures that they will always be with you when needed. Moreover, they give a new look to the smartphones, with a large variety of colors and designs. Most people already buy covers and casings to protect and accessorize their smartphones- why not buy one that is practical as well as fashionable?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Perphone Yellow"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://perphone.com/Indiegogo_Pictures/R_21_A.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Perphone Yellow""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Patent</h2>
<p>We registered a patent in Germany and filed an international application with the Patent Cooperation Treaty (aka PCT) back in 2011 (see below), to protect our idea and its investors, as well as to reserve potential developments of it in other fields of applications that we are yet studying, like self defense with pepper spray, bad breath remedies, etc.</p>
<p><strong>PCT-EP2011-063741 – German Patent Office DEGD-112092.9</strong></p>
<h2>Market</h2>
<p>We have already been testing Perphone with renowned luxury and fashion brands in Milan, Paris, Düsseldorf, etc. We were delighted to witness their initial surprise, pleasure, and interest while trying out the product and going through a brain storming on its potential application fields. One of the most recurring questions was, “How did you guys come up with that?”</p>
<h2>Why you need it…</h2>
<p>The most striking thing about Perphone is its simple necessity. While going about your day, be it at work or university, after a meal, or moving from place to place running errands, don’t you ever feel the need to get refreshed? What if you feel the need to refresh yourself before an important meeting or date, and you don’t have time, or you forgot your perfume or breath freshener? What if you have a small purse, or simply don’t want to carry around a bulky, heavy perfume bottle? What if you are traveling and cannot carry liquids with you? Not only can Perphone refresh you throughout the flight, but you can also carry enough small, light refill containers for the entirety of your trip! And since the liquid is contained in your phone cover, you will always have it with you!</p>
<h2>Project's Current Status and Next Steps:</h2>
<p>We are working extensively on the designs while testing our prototypes. We aim to release 10-ml. containers. Our next step will be developing the PVC (full product) and Carbon Fiber (cases only).</p>
<p>The already- defined prototypes will reach the market this April, if we are able to complete the tooling process and packaging on time.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2>What we need the money for?</h2>
<p>Tooling and packaging are the most expensive stages. We need help in building the molds for the product parts and the different packages we have enlisted in our catalogue and on the offered perks options.</p>
<h2>About Us</h2>

<p> </p></div>","! 2ND PHASE !
We have been able to raise part of the funds privately and can now lower the support required on Indiegogo considerably. We are closer to the release and will be ready to deliver by February already!
What a better release date for us than the Valentine's day!?
Secure your unique present for your loved ones, have fun !
What's Perphone?
Perphone is a fashion and fragrance accessory, designed around the only object that we carry always: our smartphones. Not only is it fashionable, but it also comes to one’s rescue in daily situations.
Perphone is the perfect gadget- it can be paired and matched with whatever you are wearing, can be used by everyone in all situations, and it is ideal whenever a quick refreshment is needed before a business meeting, a date, when traveling, or simply to regain a comfortable feeling. We all need to be continuously refreshed throughout the day, every day.
We aim to replace the old-fashioned, rarely used 2-ml. testers we are given by famous brands with our new containers. They are small, light, and attached to your phone, which ensures that they will always be with you when needed. Moreover, they give a new look to the smartphones, with a large variety of colors and designs. Most people already buy covers and casings to protect and accessorize their smartphones- why not buy one that is practical as well as fashionable?
 

 
The Patent
We registered a patent in Germany and filed an international application with the Patent Cooperation Treaty (aka PCT) back in 2011 (see below), to protect our idea and its investors, as well as to reserve potential developments of it in other fields of applications that we are yet studying, like self defense with pepper spray, bad breath remedies, etc.
PCT-EP2011-063741 – German Patent Office DEGD-112092.9
Market
We have already been testing Perphone with renowned luxury and fashion brands in Milan, Paris, Düsseldorf, etc. We were delighted to witness their initial surprise, pleasure, and interest while trying out the product and going through a brain storming on its potential application fields. One of the most recurring questions was, “How did you guys come up with that?”
Why you need it…
The most striking thing about Perphone is its simple necessity. While going about your day, be it at work or university, after a meal, or moving from place to place running errands, don’t you ever feel the need to get refreshed? What if you feel the need to refresh yourself before an important meeting or date, and you don’t have time, or you forgot your perfume or breath freshener? What if you have a small purse, or simply don’t want to carry around a bulky, heavy perfume bottle? What if you are traveling and cannot carry liquids with you? Not only can Perphone refresh you throughout the flight, but you can also carry enough small, light refill containers for the entirety of your trip! And since the liquid is contained in your phone cover, you will always have it with you!
Project's Current Status and Next Steps:
We are working extensively on the designs while testing our prototypes. We aim to release 10-ml. containers. Our next step will be developing the PVC (full product) and Carbon Fiber (cases only).
The already- defined prototypes will reach the market this April, if we are able to complete the tooling process and packaging on time.
 
Our 1st prototype:

 
Release date for Indiegogo Perks : February the 14th
 

  
What we need the money for?
Tooling and packaging are the most expensive stages. We need help in building the molds for the product parts and the different packages we have enlisted in our catalogue and on the offered perks options.

Our designer, Sergio Mattia, is currently residing in Italy. He has been working with 3D CAD/CAM software for about 20 years, and enjoys playing the guitar. His motto is “if after a good glass of red wine, and a homemade “antipasto” (appetizer), you still think the same, stop thinking (finish your wine) and make it real!”
Sergio Milstein is an organized computer freak with a passion for smartphones. His family is comprised of IT folks, with roots in both the former USSR and Italy. He is an extensive shopper in all northern and central Italian outlets. He is creative, innovative, and comes up with brilliant new ideas every day.

He is an extensive traveler who speaks English, Russian, German, French, and Arabic, and is focusing on our sales pipeline execution.
We would like to thank everyone who has helped us! Our virtual team is quite large, young, experienced, and altogether is fluent in 6 languages (English, Italian, German, French, Russian, Arabic), because we understand the importance of communication, and wish our product to succeed internationally.

</div></div>","Through this project we want to launch a 75mm figure inspired by the Green Knight, a character of an arthurian tale: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, contained in an english manuscript of the XIV century.

After many months of work the figure of the Green Knight is ready thanks to
the help of an extremely talented sculptor and regular collaborator of Aradia
Miniatures: Benoit Cauchies.






The Green Knight is the first of several figures that will be unlocked during this campaign as stretch additional goals. Through this campaign you have the possibility to have every figure that will be unlocked at a reduced price compared to the future sale price. (for example when The Green Knight  will be available by our website the sale price is estimated for 95 EUR + shipping costs)


         



When the main goal will be funded (1.800 €), 2 new Add-on figures will be available at a special
price expanding the campaign itself!

A new Aradia line is beginning. 
But to realize this WE NEED YOUR HELP!






                             WHAT DO YOU GET BACKING US?





What you see up in the pictures is the cast quality guaranteed for every backer.

As you can see we have already casted some copies of the figure in high
quality resin to test the final result, the product that you will have in your
hands backing this project. We wanted to start the campaign when
everything was finished so that our supporters do not have to wait a long
time. 
Check the
point named “Timeline” under the page to have more informations about the time
of delivery!





         



Well, as you know, the campaign doesn’t stop at the achievement of
the first goal: we have planned some stretch goals for you. 
* * * *
After the achievement of the main Goal 2 new Add-on figures will be unlocked at the same time! Krampus, 75mm, sculpted by Joaquin Palacios and Mawhi - the whale man, 80mm, sculpted by Allan Carrasco.



    
               
                  Baby Sad Satyr in 32mm sculpted by Christian Hardy 

  will be added FREE for every backer after the achievement of 50 supporters!  
















IMPORTANT INFO:
The figures of this campaign will not be available in stores until the last
reward will be shipped to the last backer.     
By helping us you will get greatly reduced prices before the official release of these figures and, of course, you'll have free shipping! 





We need a bit of your help to realize our new project and to start with the production of the castings. If you appreciate our new project, share the campaign to all your contacts and select the perk that you prefer! 



So get the word out and make some noise about our campaign! And
don't forget to Like our page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Aradia-Miniatures/180743868777695




Aradia is a company that is growing up very fastly, as a tree washed down with a tropical rain, thanks to the support of a lot of people.
Stefano and Federico Moggio are the brothers developers of the company (maybe you have already met them at World Model Expo 2014 in Stresa),
Stefano Moroni is the ingenious concept artist who has designed all the subjects,
Mirko Cavalloni is the official Aradia painter, a real alchemyst of the colors,

Benoit Cauchies is a regular collaborator of Aradia, who has already sculpted the successful figures of Diana and Yarish. With more than 20 years of experience in the world of sculpture his ability is outstanding,
Christian Hardy is a collaborator extremely talented with a unique and irresistible style,
Joaquin Palacios does not need any introduction: everyone knows his splendid works and from April 2015 he started to collaborate with Aradia,

Allan Carrasco is an authority in matter of big monsters and creatures, we are sure that you have already thrown your brushes on his works.


Since the original sculptures are already in our
hands, the time of delivery will be very quick: the shippings will start a couple of months after the end of the campaign, just the time to cast the figures!
SHIPPING COSTS FOR WORLDWIDE ARE FREE FOR EVERY PERK!
RISKS & CHALLENGES

We have calculated that the rewards will be ready in 1-2 months after the end
of the campaign, anyway, some potential issues could be happened:
- unexpected success of this campaign: it is unpredictable and it may
cause a bit of delay having to produce many more copies that our current
forecast.
- shipping delays: sometimes they could be, but we will do everything
we can to help ensure the product arrives safely and in a reasonable time.

</h3>
<p>We are Basma Hamdy &amp; Don Karl, the curators of<strong> Walls of Freedom</strong>. For the past one and a half years we have been working on this project collaborating with 50 photographers, 30 artists and 20 authors. Since the beginning of the revolution, we have been involved in Egypt’s thriving urban art scene. We worked closely with a network of its leading artists on mural projects, events and exhibitions. We started to work on this book in order to professionally document the Egyptian Street Art explosion. The amazing artworks of the two and a half years pieced together, tell the whole story of the Egyptian revolution.</p>
<p>We have worked with many artists, capturing their art, their vision and their stories. We collaborated with Activists, Egyptologists and Historians to accurately tell the story of the changing role of expression in public space.</p>
<p>It has been an amazing journey...</p>

<p>We have put our heart and soul and a staggering amount of work into this book. In order to complete it – and truly do justice to the artists and the story of the revolution- we now need financial support. This will cover parts of the essential costs of production such as printing, and further editing &amp; design.</p>

<p class=""p1""><strong>Why you should support us!</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">The impact of getting this project funded is huge. We believe that what we have is something much more than a graffiti book. This book captures the art, thoughts, dreams and beauty of the revolution. We have collected everything from newspaper clippings to hand-drawn sketches. We have sourced photographs from amateur and professional photographers. The essays range from expert commentary to personal accounts. We honestly did not leave a stone unturned, we dug deep into context, meaning and analysis.</p>
<p>There are many giant publishers our there who may value commercial content over depth, isn't that what sells after all? NO! Lets prove them wrong. Lets make this book epic! Because if we do we are changing the way publishing works, we are prioritizing content, we are proving that people want something beautiful AND meaningful! Everyone who agreed to work with us on this project believed in it, and we know you will believe in it too! Some photographers have risked their lives to get some of the shots that will be published in this book. Artists have been arrested and harassed and continued to paint walls through tear gas and battles. These people deserve to have their voices heard.</p>
<p>Egyptians have been fighting for freedom and social justice, and they continue to do so, this book tells their story but its really everyone's story. Anyone who values freedom will relate to this book and the stories in it and will be inspired.</p>

<p>""We will not understand the Egyptian revolution unless we delve deep into the Graffiti that covers the walls of the country. It is the true chronicle of the revolution. I am certain that ""Walls of Freedom""will be an exquisite combination of Art &amp; Intellect that reflects the true spirit of what is unravelling in our nation. Personally I cannot wait to get my copy of this book""-<strong> Magdy El-Shafee Author of Metro, the first Arabic Graphic Novel</strong></p>
<p>“Walls of Freedom is the real voice of the Egyptian revolution graffiti scene. It is not the documentation of a solitary point of view on the phenomena but a crowd-sourced collection of testimonies by actual artists who were and are still present daily in the battlefield with nothing but their spray cans. The world finally has a chance to hear our stories and see us through our own lenses.” <strong>Bahia Shehab-Ted Fellow, Islamic Art Historian and Artist</strong></p>
<p>“Walls of freedom is a reminder of people's ability to take their destiny into their own hands!” <strong>Sondos Shabayek, founder of Tahrir Monologues, political activist</strong></p>
<p> “I met Don Karl for the first time when I was bombing Alexandria with MaClaim, I was thrilled when he signed me a copy of his book 'Arabic Graffiti' which was a fusion of different styles, concepts and techniques which was carefully chosen and professionally introduced in one of the best graffiti books out there. Now I am honored to be featured in 'Walls of Freedom' which in my opinion is going to be the most honest and professional documentation of the Egyptian graffiti movement in our time.” <strong>Aya Tarek, Egyptian graffiti artist</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why do you need money if the book is finished and why isn't the publisher paying the costs?</strong></p>
<p>The book is not finished, we still need to complete the writing, editing, design, final layout and the bulk of the money we are asking for will go to printing. Our publisher is an independent pubishing house who has always been passionate about creating projects that have a meaningful impact. They are not a giant publisher focused on commercial aspects. This project has a limited budget and in order to complete it we need to raise the money. </p>
<p><strong>How will you know my size for the T-shirts?</strong></p>
<p>if you picked a perk that includes a T-shirt, sizes available are S, M, L, XL. We will be in touch to get your tshirt sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Can I pick more than one perk?</strong></p>
<p>Yes but you must pay for them separately so that we can keep track of what you chose.</p>
<p><strong>Can I contribute more money than a particular category?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, if you chose a perk that is $130 and you want to give $200 go ahead and enter the number manually upon checkout.</p>
<p><strong>If you raise more than you need what will you do with the money?</strong></p>
<p>We have created some amazing projects like: <a href=""http://www.whitewallbeirut.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">White Wall Beirut</a>, <a href=""http://vimeo.com/joelsames/we-are-all-khaled-said-berlin-wall"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Khaled Said on the Berlin Wall</a>, and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151123102394926.436507.308626659925&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arabic Graffiti &amp; Street Art in Frabkfurt</a>. If we raise more than we need we plan to create graffiti events &amp; exhibitions in Egypt to help promote the artists and the medium.</p>
<p>We also plan to expand the book and include foldout pages to create a more interactive book (similar to the foldout above). The more money we raise the better the book will be and the more events and artists we can support.</p>
<p><strong>Why are there similar designs in the Artwork &amp; Print Perks?</strong></p>
<p>Some artists like ElSeed &amp; Mohamed Gaber are offering original artworks, but we are also offering prints of their work that are more affordable. The Artworks are orginial, meaning they were created by the artist &amp; signed. The prints are copies of the artwork but are high-quality on heavyweight paper suitable for framing.</p>
<p><strong>I don't want a perk, can I still donate?</strong></p>
<p>Sue just click the ""contribute"" button, enter the sum you want to donate and choose ""No perk I just want to donate"".</p>
<p><strong>I chose my perk, now what?</strong></p>
<p>Please refer to the REFERENCE DIAGRAM and then choose the perk from the indiegogo menu on the right, check out and enter the code next to your shipping address.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p></div>","Thank you for making 'Walls of Freedom' a reality. In case you missed the Indiegogo campaign, you can click here and order the book!



We are Basma Hamdy & Don Karl, the curators of Walls of Freedom. For the past one and a half years we have been working on this project collaborating with 50 photographers, 30 artists and 20 authors. Since the beginning of the revolution, we have been involved in Egypt’s thriving urban art scene. We worked closely with a network of its leading artists on mural projects, events and exhibitions. We started to work on this book in order to professionally document the Egyptian Street Art explosion. The amazing artworks of the two and a half years pieced together, tell the whole story of the Egyptian revolution.
We have worked with many artists, capturing their art, their vision and their stories. We collaborated with Activists, Egyptologists and Historians to accurately tell the story of the changing role of expression in public space.
It has been an amazing journey...

We have put our heart and soul and a staggering amount of work into this book. In order to complete it – and truly do justice to the artists and the story of the revolution- we now need financial support. This will cover parts of the essential costs of production such as printing, and further editing & design.
Check our diagram below for more info:

 



We have knocked on all doors and windows and managed to get you some mind blowing and exclusive perks. We are offering some very special deals and even original artworks from some of the most influential artists in the region. Check out the list on the right or look in the perk section below for a clear breakdown. We will be adding more perks and updating our page so check back often!
 
 
Why you should support us!
The impact of getting this project funded is huge. We believe that what we have is something much more than a graffiti book. This book captures the art, thoughts, dreams and beauty of the revolution. We have collected everything from newspaper clippings to hand-drawn sketches. We have sourced photographs from amateur and professional photographers. The essays range from expert commentary to personal accounts. We honestly did not leave a stone unturned, we dug deep into context, meaning and analysis.
There are many giant publishers our there who may value commercial content over depth, isn't that what sells after all? NO! Lets prove them wrong. Lets make this book epic! Because if we do we are changing the way publishing works, we are prioritizing content, we are proving that people want something beautiful AND meaningful! Everyone who agreed to work with us on this project believed in it, and we know you will believe in it too! Some photographers have risked their lives to get some of the shots that will be published in this book. Artists have been arrested and harassed and continued to paint walls through tear gas and battles. These people deserve to have their voices heard.
Egyptians have been fighting for freedom and social justice, and they continue to do so, this book tells their story but its really everyone's story. Anyone who values freedom will relate to this book and the stories in it and will be inspired.
 


 
Don Karl is a cultural activist, graffiti artist, author and publisher from Berlin. He started to paint graffiti in 1983 and runs the publishing house From Here To Fame.

Basma Hamdy is an Egyptian artist, designer & professor who graduated from the American University in Cairo in 1998 and obtained a Master of Fine Arts from MICA (the Maryland Institute College of Art in 2003).

“This book, is an act within our revolution – our continuing revolution.”Ahdaf Soueif, Booker prize finalist, Egyptian Novelist, political & Cultural commentator
""Walls of Freedom shows what we as Egyptians have accomplished until today, something we need to appreciate, to know how we should continue.” Hanaa el Degham, Artist
""How many books have been published about Egypt's revolutionary Streetart? This is the only one I wanna read!"" Ganzeer, Artist
""We will not understand the Egyptian revolution unless we delve deep into the Graffiti that covers the walls of the country. It is the true chronicle of the revolution. I am certain that ""Walls of Freedom""will be an exquisite combination of Art & Intellect that reflects the true spirit of what is unravelling in our nation. Personally I cannot wait to get my copy of this book""- Magdy El-Shafee Author of Metro, the first Arabic Graphic Novel
“Walls of Freedom is the real voice of the Egyptian revolution graffiti scene. It is not the documentation of a solitary point of view on the phenomena but a crowd-sourced collection of testimonies by actual artists who were and are still present daily in the battlefield with nothing but their spray cans. The world finally has a chance to hear our stories and see us through our own lenses.” Bahia Shehab-Ted Fellow, Islamic Art Historian and Artist
“Walls of freedom is a reminder of people's ability to take their destiny into their own hands!” Sondos Shabayek, founder of Tahrir Monologues, political activist
 “I met Don Karl for the first time when I was bombing Alexandria with MaClaim, I was thrilled when he signed me a copy of his book 'Arabic Graffiti' which was a fusion of different styles, concepts and techniques which was carefully chosen and professionally introduced in one of the best graffiti books out there. Now I am honored to be featured in 'Walls of Freedom' which in my opinion is going to be the most honest and professional documentation of the Egyptian graffiti movement in our time.” Aya Tarek, Egyptian graffiti artist

<p>SPOKEN WORD:</p>
<p>                <em>A YOUTH MOVEMENT</em></p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>BRAVE NEW VOICES </strong></p>
<p><strong>INTERNATIONAL YOUTH POETRY FESTIVAL:</strong></p>
<p>In addition to our in-school residencies where we visit over 25 schools a year, Phonetic Spit also takes a team of 6-7 students to participate in the BNV International Youth Poetry Festival. BNV is an annual festival where students for all across the globe unite and share their personal stories and diverse cultures. With in the 5 day festival our students particapate in dynamic youth development work shop and high energy poetry slams. This is a once in a life time experience for our students, most of which come from underserved communities and low income households. This year’s festival will be held in Chicago, IL.</p>
<p><strong>What we need:   </strong></p>
<p>The total cost of this trip is between $8,000 &amp; 9,000 (depending on travel expenses)</p>
<p>$1,500: Registration fee that covers 6 students and 1 staff/coach (This fee is due May 15th to secure our spot)</p>
<p>            - This fee covers room and board and 1 meal a day for the entire conference</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$1,500: To cover room and board and 1 meal a day for 1 additional student &amp; 2 additional staff (1 female and 1 male) to make sure we cover a proper ratio to ensure the safety of our students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$3,500 - $4,500: This would cover 9 round trip airline tickets to Chicago based on air fares today. This cost will go up the closer we get to the departure date. (Based on rates as of 5-20-13)  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>$1,500: Additional money for food at $30/per day for 7 students and 3 staff.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Total:$8,000 - $9000</p>
<p>Sponsorship:$5,000 (This sponsorship was made possible by Project Humanities)</p>
<p>Total needed: Approximately $5,000 based on travel expenses and incentive packages.  </p>

<p><strong>(None of the funds raised goes towards staff salaries. The countless hours our staff put into making this trip possible with coordination, 3 times per week coaching, fundraising, etc… is all donated)</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The impact an experience like this can have on a young person is priceless. In addition to the social development these students will also be exposed to a very radical educational experience. One of the students who participated in last year’s trip, Garrett Pauli, met the lead liaison to The University of Wisconsin’s Frist Wave Program. This is a radical program that uses the pedagogy of Spoken Word and Hip Hop Theatre to further develop our next generation of leaders. They offer 10 full ride scholarships to graduating seniors from all across the globe. Upon returning home from the festival, Garrett began the process of applying for this very prestigious opportunity, and based on his participation in our programs he was 1 of 10 students to be awarded the scholarship. As the director of Phonetic Spit I am honored to say that Garrett is the third student from our program that has awarded with this opportunity.    </p>

</div></div>","9168 Paris - Rio c'est : 
Un thème. La vision de l’autre et de son environnement culturel. Le projet 9168 invite les artistes à un véritable dialogue interculturel et cherche, à travers l’art, à rapprocher deux pays, pourtant géographiquement opposés.
Une rencontre. Non seulement la rencontre d’artistes de nationalités différentes mais aussi de courants différents : l’art contemporain et l’art urbain. Tous deux seront en fusion par l’intermédiaire de différentes disciplines telles que les arts visuels, la danse ou encore la musique. Notre sélection d’artistes cherchera à illustrer comment des réalisations issues de cultures différentes peuvent trouver des points de convergence.
Des artistes confirmés et émergents. Le festival sera aussi l’occasion pour de jeunes artistes en devenir d’exposer aux côtés d’artistes de renom tels que Toz (graffeur brésilien confirmé), ou encore Henry Hang (artiste plasticien). 
Nous avons besoin de vous ! 

Nous avons besoin de fonds afin de financer : 
- Les tirages des photographies qui seront exposées tout au long du festival
- Ainsi que les différents vernissages, auxquels vous êtes conviés! 
C'est pourquoi nous espérons, grâce à votre aide, atteindre la somme de 2 000 Euros. 
En contrepartie, nous vous proposons de nombreux goodies, des affiches de l'exposition, des cartes réalisées par les artistes, et une visite privée de l'exposition...  

La programmation : 

1. Une exposition d'un mois et demi à la Maison des arts de Créteil (ligne 8 : Créteil préfecture, à 30 minutes de République), à partir du samedi 24 septembre 2016. Au programme : seront exposés entre autres Toz, Henry Hang, Lazoo, 9eme concept, Batsh, Marc Goldstain, Antonin Heck, Pok, Adèle Taillefert, Nicolas Denis, Emilie Hoa Fleury, Baptiste Marescaux, Irvin Heller, Hadrien Durand-Baïssas... Et d'autres belles surprises vous attendent!  

2. Le 24 septembre sera une journée consacrée également au live painting, à l'intérieur du centre commercial Créteil Soleil, en présence de 6 artistes graffeurs. 

3. Une série de conférences à La Place, centre culturel Hip Hop au forum des Halles à Paris, dès le mois d'octobre. Le projet 9168 Paris - Rio, c'est aussi l'envie de comprendre le climat artistique et culturel actuel à l'échelle internationale, c'est pourquoi est organisée avec La Place, une série de conférences sur les thèmes de l'art urbain et de l'art contemporain au sein de nos sociétés.

4. L'exposition des œuvres du street artiste brésilien Pok à la Galerie d'art de Créteil. Dans sa dynamique de valorisation de l'art brésilien, le projet 9168 a choisi de dédier pleinement la galerie de Créteil à Pok. Le vernissage aura lieu le vendredi 23 septembre 2016.

<h2>The End</h2>
<p>A collaborative Zine about the End of the World. Print issues will be out in September 2020<br/> </p>
<h3>What‘s a Zine?</h3>
<p><br/>A Zine is something like a magazine - just not »professional«, i.e. with a budget and a publisher. Back in the days and still today zines are often created by a single person, printed at home, stitched together by hand. The plan for The End, though, is to get it printed by a company in a small number, depending on money raised via crowdfunding and preorder.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596203364/ifkknmuwizx1hfio2pbk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What‘s the Apocalypse?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>It‘s a lot. Many different ideas and meanings. Currently a lot of people feel the Corona crisis is the Apocalypse... Anyway, whatever it is, it has to do with big things ending. Society, nature, humankind - either they cease existing completely or they just change in a drastic way that unhinges our lives. That‘s what this Zine is about.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596203342/hy7boc9qayjehdudeh0t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What‘s in it?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A lot of people have been contributing content (without payment!). Fiction and essays, comics and illustrations, fotos and memes, poems and music. Basically everything was allowed, all kinds of artistic expression dealing with the End of the World.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596203309/zal3ycjsnisld7xykmz5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>
<br/>What comes out?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>There will be one printed issue of The End. Page count might be around 60 to 70. The number of issues will be 100, so it's limited!<br/>With 400€ we can get the Zine printed with the full page count and also cover the shipping costs. If there is less many we might need to cut down on the page count to maximum 60 pages.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who are the people contributing?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Friends, mostly. Old friends and new friends, some of them I befriended by asking them to make a contribution to this project. Some of them are artists, some are not or didn‘t know they were. I would say there is a certain tendency to leftist intersectional feminism as a common feature in this group but otherwise it's quite diverse. They all contributed without receiving any kind of payment.</p>

<h3>
<br/>Who is Julia Freier?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, that‘s me! I am a graphic designer and illustrator from Berlin. I am a white cis woman, poor and queer, creative and mother. I love many aspects of my graphic design job - drawing, designing, layouting, working with clients. Furthermore I love working with people, connecting, joining forces and ideas. So this project is the incarnation of my passion. It would be cool if I got paid for it, but you can‘t have it all, right?</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Why a Zine about the Apocalypse?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Storytime. I wanted to make a zine because I wanted to do some creative project on my own conditions. I pondered about the topic. Than I realised that every conversation I had with any person somehow at some point touched the End of the World. The idea seemed to be everywhere. On Netflix, at parties, in my own mind. So there was my topic.<br/>That was in summer 2019. Now reality has caught up with art and as I am writing this, there is a worldwide pandemia that feels pretty apocalyptic...</p>
<p><i>So this is...</i></p>

Ce sera ma première chorégraphie de groupe et ma première collaboration avec le festival.BALLS est une pièce collaborative chorégraphiée par moi-même, interprétée par six danseuses et est accompagnée d'une partition musicale interactive. BALLS est une recherche chorégraphique sur la façon dont les femmes et leurs corps sont représentés dans les sports et la compétition. L'œuvre utilise le mouvement déjà présent dans le sport pour dévoiler les perceptions du corps féminin dans le dialogue avec le travail d'équipe, la compétition, la force, la faiblesse et le soutien.Ce projet comporte trois semaines de répétitions qui serviront à terminer la création et qui seront suivies de trois performances.La recherche chorégraphique de BALLS a profité de la précieuse collaboration des danseuses Léna Demnati, Erin O'Loughlin, Marilyne Cyr, Koliane Rochon Prom Tep, Katherine Ng, Jessie Lhôte, Naomi CP Hillaire, Lara Oundjian, Cara Roy, Nyda Kwasowsky et le compositeur Samuel Dzierzawa. Je remercie la généreuse contribution de ces artistes incroyables!Les spectacles sont GRATUITS pour tous !! Les horaires sont:Dimanche 9 septembre à 11h30 - Marché MaisonneuveLundi 10 septembre à 17h - Jardins GamelinMercredi 12 septembre 12h30 - Place des Festivals OBJECTIF:Montant visé: 4000 $J'amasse des fonds pour assurer le cachet des artistes impliqués dans ce projet. L'argent couvrira les frais artistiques des six danseuses, du compositeur, du créateur de costume, ainsi que des accessoires et costumes supplémentaires.En tant que chorégraphe et employeuse, la capacité de contester les normes de la danse est essentielle à ma pratique. J'apprécie le travail collaboratif. Bien que je n'ai pas reçu de financement des bureaux de subventions publics au Canada et au Québec en 2018, j'ai occupé des postes secondaires pour obtenir les fonds nécessaires au paiement équitable de tous les collaborateurs. Je me tourne maintenant vers ma communauté pour obtenir du soutien. Votre soutien est inestimable et fera de ce projet un succès en m'aidant à réaliser mon rêve de créer des emplois durables pour danseurs et artistes!COMMENT AIDER?Chaque don est d'une grande valeur et contribue directement au succès de mon projet!Comme beaucoup d’entre nous sont des artistes vivant dans un capitalisme avancé, je comprends qu’il n’est pas possible pour tous de faire des dons. Si vous souhaitez soutenir BALLS autrement, je vous invite à partager cette campagne sur Facebook, Twitter ou Instagram.Merci pour votre support sans lequel je ne pourrais mener ce projet à terme! J'espère vous voir au spectacle! In studio photo by: Bobby LéonOutdoor photos by: Megan Mericle",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Siege Machine and I have the privilege of working with the GREATEST CREW IN THE WORLD. I was the Construction Coordinator and Lead Carpenter for the
Trojan Horse at Burning Man 2011, and I was the Artist and Construction Lead
for Anubis at Burning Man 2012. I live in the Bay Area of California, and I
want to bring another fantastic sculpture to Burning Man with your help!  I have that same great crew who brought you those two projects ready and willing to help build this sculpture, and we need your financial support for our newest project.-- Building at NIMBY May, 10th.  We are really making great progress!






What ARE we building this year?The Alien Siege Machine is huge. HUGE. H U G E. It is a 4 story, wooden, interactive and interpretive Burning Man
sculpture for Burning Man 2014. This project is going to be a hugely
collaborative week-long extravaganza of kinetic connection, lights, sounds,
myth and exploration. The piece is alive and active with participants:
The grand perch of the elevated catwalks are brimming with participants
gleefully looking out over Black Rock City and all of its artistic wonders. The
interior spaces are teeming with participants working the cannons, tracks, and
deciphering the trans-temporal story of The Alien Siege Machine.

<p>WHY DOES BUILD THE FIRE MATTER?</p>
<p>Our State is uniquely positioned to influence and inspire the world through the Arts because its young minds are creating groundbreaking work at an extremely high caliber. However, three major issues currently plague Louisiana’s arts scene:</p>
<p>1. We are not improving quality of life by introducing new beneficial paradigms:</p>

<p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>To address the problems mentioned above, creative minds of Louisiana have come together to launch a monthly music and art exhibition entitled Build The Fire. The event serves to provide the appropriate milieu for artists and supporters of the arts in three ways:</p>
<p>1. Build The Fire brings to independent thinkers who appraise artistic, social, political, and spiritual norms critically.</p>
<p>2. Build The Fire is creating a new narrative around how and why Louisianans can appreciate the arts as a tool for social improvement:</p>
<p>3. Build The Fire offers a platform for artists to connect with their peers as well as potential customers:<span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<div>We would like to take the next step in spreading the word by producing videos of our exhibition.

BUILD THE FIRE -
Definition: v. the process of
bringing to Life that which you'd like to see in the World; fulfilling a personal
initiative. 

n. A monthly experience displaying, building, and
celebrating one another's personal “Fire” through curating of fine arts. Good
Spirits and Vivid Times are guaranteed.

Build the Fire is a growing group of youth who wish to express and explore the realm of the arts. Young talented people who are seeking a community where they can be themselves and be around others of like passion. Build the Fire supports the arts and allows them to network with each other and those are ready in the field through exhibitions. We've been supported by local businesses so far by them hosting our events at no charge. We've grown at a great rate but could still use help with funding for other expenses.


WHY DOES BUILD THE FIRE MATTER?
Our State is uniquely positioned to influence and inspire the world through the Arts because its young minds are creating groundbreaking work at an extremely high caliber. However, three major issues currently plague Louisiana’s arts scene:
1. We are not improving quality of life by introducing new beneficial paradigms:
2. We are not rectifying past mistakes made by destructive social programming:
3. We are not stimulating others to become artists - keeping the movement alive:
SOLUTION
To address the problems mentioned above, creative minds of Louisiana have come together to launch a monthly music and art exhibition entitled Build The Fire. The event serves to provide the appropriate milieu for artists and supporters of the arts in three ways:
1. Build The Fire brings to independent thinkers who appraise artistic, social, political, and spiritual norms critically.
2. Build The Fire is creating a new narrative around how and why Louisianans can appreciate the arts as a tool for social improvement:
3. Build The Fire offers a platform for artists to connect with their peers as well as potential customers: 


We would like to take the next step in spreading the word by producing videos of our exhibition. Mostly we operate by volunteers, but it's hard to always request help that may not available when needed. We're looking to produce our own videos and images of our events to show just how serious and passionate we are about this. Any extra funding we receive will go to sound equipment for exhibitions, catering for our fellow artists, and any other needs that should arise.

We've hosted three events this year and hope to host more. People are traveling from further places to join us than we thought would, and we would like to share that with others.

Your contributions will help young minds reach their potential and their dreams. We need to know that more people believe in us and support our crafts. Be a supporter and support us.

</div></div>","The Sunken City Side show is the New Orleans Burning Man Community (NOLABRC)'s  art project going to Burning Man 2015. It will be inside the Burning Man Midway, at the center of the city surrounding the Man. We are reaching out to our friends, family, and community to donate and show your support for the Sunken City Sideshow taking you back in time to the days of Storyville and Riverboat shows.  A long forgotten bayou carnival sets the background where we present a soap box stage with assorted carnival acts, mischief and improvisational performances of a 10 in 1 sideshow, an entry arch framed by posters of exhibits and assorted “freaks and oddities” with something much more mysterious once you are lured into the inner sanctum full of contraptions, photo ops and oddities to inspire the adventurous.  Beware of the swamp rougarou and the Gator Oil salesmen! Come be part of our live Tarot Body Painting project or hitch a ride on a swamp tour!We appreciate your support and can't wait to see you all on the playa. Love from NOLA and donate here! The perks are unique and awesome!

For more details about a few of the attractions inside and our budget, see below:

Micaceous project -Using low fire Micaceous clay, Burners will each fashion a small 3"" ball clay sculpture of their own design by pinch method. After left to SLOWLY completely dry each piece will be placed by guidance of Burn Techs at the base of CORE effigies where they will remain through the fire and until removed by Burn Techs into cooling lines along the Playa.  The fires will provide sufficient heat to bisque the clay sculptures, the combustibles stuffed around them & materials of the effigies will create natural markings and act as aesthetic glazes for these Burner Micaceous cups created by Burners ON PLAYA! Burners can collect and take home these pieces and may be encouraged to load images of them to an online Burner virtual art gallery.



Low Fire Raku Clay 25lb bag
$8 x 10bags  $80


Sandwich ziplocs  20 per box and  13 boxes @ $50

Work table - $40

Total - $170


Body Tarot Cards - The goal of this project is to co-create a Tarot using symbols from the four suits of a deck of cards ( the original Tarot), visionary imagery illustrating the 10 Principles of Burning Man and each individual's personal style to transform a person or group into a human interpretation of each Tarot card. Images of each interpretation can be submitted to a database after the event to be compiled into an online virtual gallery showcasing the individual's image and the photographic art from the project

Bearded Lady and The New
Natives Photo Opportunities and Take-Home Photos
Bearded Lady - With the
ever so popular selfie-trend, social media allows people to portray the best
images of themselves even though that image may not actually be reflective of
reality. This ""bearded lady"" sideshow allows people to play on that
concept by trying on different beards and other accessories to create a
different image of themselves but rather than posting it for the world to see,
we will have a mirror and plan on taking a polaroid of the person for them to
take away with them.



Film for instant photos – 500 photos = $400


Inventive beards (yarn,
denim, etc – need elastic and hot glue) $50


Donated costumes and
accessories $0 


The New Natives - An
interactive photo project - People can wander up, put on a grass skirt and
possibly a mask, and pose for an old timey portrait holding anything that is
dear to them - it is sort of like ""What is the one thing you would take
with yourself to a desert ...or the playa!



Paints for backdrops $100

Shared backdrop material $100

Accessories $100


Total - $750




Swamp Tours – a self-push wooden swamp air boat for rides in and out of the

<h3>The Tale of The Temple</h3>
<p><span>The Temple of Times was created in 2012. Built as a secondary effigy for Burning Flipside, a Texas Regional Event, but a shift in wind meant the Temple was not to burn. For nearly a year, designer Adam Carrell worked to find a new home for the Temple burning, and was accepted for the Burning Man Circle of Regional Effigies. Wanting his previous design to be bigger, better, burnier, Adam enlisted the help of fellow Austin</span><span> designers, constructors, and go-getters and the Temple of Times is now traveling</span><span> to Black Rock City with new features, and a new meaning. Representing the passage of time -- the past, present, and future, The Temple stands ready.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Austin has always been a special place with its association to Burning Man. Burning Flipside was the first regional Burning Man event, and has now grown to be its own destination and spawned its own spin-off events. George Paap (St. Tiki) was the first Regional Contact for Burning Man, and representatives from Austin continue to be deeply ingrained in the Regional Network, DPW, Art Support, Rangers, etc. for Burning Man. There are no shortage of 'Burners' in Austin, creating wonderful experiences both at home and around the world. </span></span></p>

</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>Our core team is composed of four individuals who were brought together while working on the Tree of Life (LoF 2013: Superstition) and have been challenging ourselves with new projects and creative avenues. This is the second Regional Effigy for this core team. The four individuals listed below were central core members of the Effigy at Lakes of Fire: Superstition, the Tree of Life. We are eager to return to Mosaic and yet again push ourselves to create and inspire.<br/><br/>The Mothership Love is an effigy project like no other! Using the power of FIRE we will make the fifteen foot tall effigy defy gravity in a multitude of ways. Utilizing science and ingenuity as our tools we aim to create a highly interactive and engaging experience before, during and after the burn.</span></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Cause / Community Driven</h3>
<div>As with anything in this world, to make the Mothership Love possible we need funds.</div>
<div>We have already secured $1000 in the form of an art grant (thank you Mosaic!) but still need around another $1000 to complete all aspects of this project. These funds will cover things like wood/build supplies, lighting, shop work(any specialized cutting and designs for the project), transport and any other costs that could potentially come up.</div>
<div>Any funds left over from this project will be given back to the Mosaic Experiment or gifted to other artists currently working on projects for the event to ensure the most amazing experience and help others Defy Gravity.</div>
<div>To help entice you we have some cool perks, but the best part is helping make Mosaic an amazing event for everyone there to enjoy!<br/><br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Why Donate?</h3>
<div>We are a team that is dedicated to making this project a reality. We are passionate about this community and what it stands for. It empowers individuals to make the impossible possible. It also represents the power that people and a community can have when we put our resources together. By helping us through donation you are channeling your intent into our project and in turn, the event.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Our design is very ambitious in what we want to do. We are trying to envoke the theme of the event in as many ways that we can. With the Mothership Love we are literally aiming for the stars. Even so, we are ready to handle any issues that arise.<br/><br/>Potential issue: Getting the effigy to spin while on fire/other effects to work</p>
<p>Solution: We are near completion of a scale build to test all effects and concepts and have had success so far with the design and implementation of our effects. If something cannot be completed in a safe and reasonable manner though it will be modified or worst case scrapped</p>
<p>Potential issue: We don't make our funding goal/only get partial funding</p>
<p>Solution: We are also hosting an addtitional fund raising at the Necto Night Club event to help with our costs. FB event can be found here (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/471662093010714/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/471662093010714/</a>)</p>
<p>Potential Issue: We Defy gravity so hard that we don't come back down</p>

</div></div>","Who we areCHECK OUT OUR INTERVIEW WITH MOSAIC HERE!SCALE EFFIGY BURN IS LIVE!
 
Our core team is composed of four individuals who were brought together while working on the Tree of Life (LoF 2013: Superstition) and have been challenging ourselves with new projects and creative avenues. This is the second Regional Effigy for this core team. The four individuals listed below were central core members of the Effigy at Lakes of Fire: Superstition, the Tree of Life. We are eager to return to Mosaic and yet again push ourselves to create and inspire.The Mothership Love is an effigy project like no other! Using the power of FIRE we will make the fifteen foot tall effigy defy gravity in a multitude of ways. Utilizing science and ingenuity as our tools we aim to create a highly interactive and engaging experience before, during and after the burn.
  The Cause / Community Driven
As with anything in this world, to make the Mothership Love possible we need funds.
We have already secured $1000 in the form of an art grant (thank you Mosaic!) but still need around another $1000 to complete all aspects of this project. These funds will cover things like wood/build supplies, lighting, shop work(any specialized cutting and designs for the project), transport and any other costs that could potentially come up.
Any funds left over from this project will be given back to the Mosaic Experiment or gifted to other artists currently working on projects for the event to ensure the most amazing experience and help others Defy Gravity.
To help entice you we have some cool perks, but the best part is helping make Mosaic an amazing event for everyone there to enjoy!
   Why Donate?
We are a team that is dedicated to making this project a reality. We are passionate about this community and what it stands for. It empowers individuals to make the impossible possible. It also represents the power that people and a community can have when we put our resources together. By helping us through donation you are channeling your intent into our project and in turn, the event.
    Risks & Challenges Our design is very ambitious in what we want to do. We are trying to envoke the theme of the event in as many ways that we can. With the Mothership Love we are literally aiming for the stars. Even so, we are ready to handle any issues that arise.Potential issue: Getting the effigy to spin while on fire/other effects to work
Solution: We are near completion of a scale build to test all effects and concepts and have had success so far with the design and implementation of our effects. If something cannot be completed in a safe and reasonable manner though it will be modified or worst case scrapped
Potential issue: We don't make our funding goal/only get partial funding
Solution: We are also hosting an addtitional fund raising at the Necto Night Club event to help with our costs. FB event can be found here (https://www.facebook.com/events/471662093010714/)
Potential Issue: We Defy gravity so hard that we don't come back down
