<p>La Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain
range (Colombia) is home to the native American Tayrona culture; consisting of
the Kogui, Wiwa, Arhuaco and Kankuamo. Living in one of the most unique regions
of the world, an area marked for its diversity and abundance, which they
refer to as <i><b>The Heart of the World</b></i>, these four pueblos
(indigenous tribes) have thrived for millennium.  In their simple yet
profound wisdom, these ancient peoples – a living example of sustainability
after thousands of years preserving their relationship with Mother Earth – have come
to share with the world their insight and ongoing actions/initiatives for
Global transformation and Mother Earth Restoration. </p>
The
way of life and culture of the Four Peoples of the Earth, for the most part has
been virtually untouched by the modern world.  Their mission, which they
see as their<b><i> Sacred Responsibility in the Web of
Life</i></b>  since the origins of time, is to preserve Universal Balance on
Mother Earth.  Because they continue to see the global, social and bio-cultural
crisis escalating beyond critical levels – even after years of raising awareness about pressing issues that we are all very familiar with – they have now been
instructed or mandated to seek concrete, complementary action(s) to
fulfill this mission.<p><span style=""line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;""><span></span></span></p>

<p>One of the seeds found in La Sierra, and of
course in all of Colombia, is the coffee bean itself, which in her original
nature possesses all of the attributes necessary to interact in the global
arena. The Elders view the seed of the coffee as a sacred element that will
communicate their story; a story infused in the bean itself, which when taken to the
cup brings awareness to the importance of our sacred relationship with the
Earth herself.</p>
<p>From their spiritual perspective:</p>
<p><i><b>Since the origins of time,
before coffee was ever a plant, she was a woman dressed in Earth, who
in her lunar cycles would sow her red seed in the land.</b></i></p>
<i><b>This seed embodies a Mother, which contains the stories that once
again connect us with the “life originating
principles” and through a golden thread of ancestral memories, sustains us
in unity with the Earth.</b></i><p><i><strong></strong></i></p>

<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The coffee is prepared as a homeopathic
remedy to help remind us of our <em><strong>ONENESS</strong></em>, serving to bring us back into <strong>UNITY</strong> as
peoples of the Earth.  Each plant is cultivated with cultural and
spiritual values that preserve the sacred balance of nature and sustain life on
the planet. </p>
Coffee
is abundant in certain regions of La Sierra and is much sought after in the
world market for its distinctive qualities. This handpicked, shade-grown,
bird-friendly, natural and wild coffee derives its unique characteristics from
the diversity of its surroundings. The coffee we will be working with from this
region is sought after for its bright flavours and clean palate. This strain of
Tipica coffee is “naturally” grown and interacts in its respective ecosystem
through the principles of reciprocity, or complimentary relationships; in other
words without pesticides and without harming the environment.  In essence,
it is another vital element of the ecosystems of La Sierra Nevada de Santa
Marta that helps sustain the diverse range of flora and fauna. Peoples of the
Earth Coffee will bring about restoration processes within other coffee
producing communities through their exemplary ancient cultural methods. </div>

In an unprecedented moment in Human History, the Peoples of the Earth from La Sierra and all over the world call upon Humanity to assure a transformed global society that leaves a legacy for all our Children of clean air, fresh water, fertile soil and harmony in the Human Spirit.This is an opportunity to be a part of our

<div>I am a 32 years old Entomologist and Food Scientist and have had a passion for bugs since childhood. I have now passed on this passion to my children, Marley (3 years), Saxon (1.5 years) and Connor (6 Months). That's right...I am completely crazy. I live with my husband and children in Western Sydney (Australia) and completing this project will help make our production process more streamlined, meaning I get to spend more time with my beautiful family. Owning your own business is hard work, it takes years of dedication and sacrifice. We have been doing ground work for the Edible Insect community for years, and now is the perfect time to launch our products in retail stores.

</div></div>","Buzzing Around
80% of the world's population is already doing something amazing that can help provide sustainable food for our Children and Grandchildren. The Western World has been slow to catch on, but you can join us on our mission to expand our food knowledge and develop a healthy, sustainable and delicious food source that will provide food security for the future generations.
Our Australian based company, Edible Bug Shop, has developed a range of innovative retail products, which use Edible Insects as a SUPERFOOD ingredient. Instead of reaching for a packet of chips, we aim to get you snacking on some protein rich VitaBug Protein Balls or Chilli & Garlic Snack Crickets. 
Some of you might be thinking..YUCK, but please read on, because it wasn't that long ago that eating SUSHI was considered an unusual dinner option!



By the year 2050 the world's population will grow to over 9 billion people, and our current food production methods just won't be able to cope. It is predicted that we will need 70% more meat, have 15% less biodiversity and over 1 billion people will be without fresh water. 
The FAO has identified Edible Insects as one solution to the problem. 


By replacing one meat based meal per week with insects, you can save over 100,000L water every year
Insect production requires less space, and can be farmed vertically, leaving more farmland available for crops such as vegetables and grain
Insects don't waste energy maintaining their body temperature, so convert most of what they eat directly into body mass. 10kg of grain will produce 1kg of beef OR 9kg of yummy crickets


Farming insects creates 1/100th of the amount of Carbon Dioxide as beef production, so reduces the impact on the environment. 


Over the past 8 years, we have been growing our edible insect range slowly, reinvesting profits back into the company to help develop new and exciting products, and to help make our edible insect breeding facility as environmentally sustainable as possible. We are now at the point where we are ready to launch our new VITABUG range of products into retail stores, and we would like you to join us in doing this. 
VitaBug uses both whole, and powdered (invisible) insects and focuses on making super yummy products that happen to be healthy, sustainable and natural too. The aim of the brand is to provide a somewhat unfamiliar food ingredient (the edible insects) and present them in a familiar way. It is our responsibility to make Edible Insects more popular in Western Cultures and we believe our future population will embrace edible insects as a sustainable food item, which will decrease the stresses our planet feels through traditional livestock production. 
By contributing towards our campaign, you will not only help us launch our VITABUG range into retail stores, you will be helping introduce the world to a sustainable, delicious and healthy food source- EDIBLE INSECTS

We have retail stores on standby and they would love to make our VITABUG range available to their customers, we just need a little help from you to help us JUMP into the market and complete our full scale launch. 
Over the past 8 years, our business has educated, enticed and evolved. Now we want to share our passion for EDIBLE INSECTS with the world, by launching sustainable and delicious insect products and you can help us do it. 




From the very beginning, our aim has been to normalise insects as a source of food worldwide, and we have been recognised for it! Here are just some of our awards, with the most recent being 2015 Excellence in Sustainability and 2014 Excellence in Innovation. 


   What We Need
We need $5,000 to get things started. This will go towards


Printing our new range of packaging
Some professional photos of our products for brochures and website
Purchasing of bulk ingredients to make our production more streamlined
EDUCATION- Putting our staff in retail stores to  help teach consumers about the benefits of edible insects as a food source. This will include cooking demonstrations and in store tastings

If we do not raise the $5,000 required to take this big JUMP into our retail launch, we will still be able to take small steps. Every little contribution will be used to purchase as many bulk ingredient as possible, and we will launch products in small stages. 
If we raise over the $5,000...and we hope we do... we will use the additional funds to complete our HACCP and ISO certifications- We already have the processes in place and require the audit to be completed for the final certification assessment. 

The Good Stuff... THE PERKS
Even the tiniest contribution will be reward! Our entry level perk includes a eBook containing delicious Edible Insect recipes from some super creative people, and it only gets better from there. See the PERKS to the right of screen, to see what your contribution will include


Our eBook contains 10 recipes, which will show you how versatile cooking with insects can be
Our reformulated Orange and Macadamia Performance Bar has been in production since 2008, and has recently undergone a facelift. It is 100% natural, paleo and is a good source of protein and micronutrients. 
All contributors- no matter how big or small, will be recognized in a dedicated section of our website. 
These Chilli & Garlic Cricket Snacks are our most popular product. We have recently changed the formula to have a bigger chilli kick. The 20g pack is a great alternative to nuts or chips, it has 12g of protein, 44% RDI calcium, 40% RDI Iron, 100% RDI copper, zinc, manganese, magnesium with heaps of essential amino acids and B12 vitamins. 






We have been working hard to educate the public about the benefits of edible insects, and now you can help us too! As part of your perk, you can contribute to our educational video, which will initially be shown in Schools around Australia as part of our incursion program. Schools will be invited to include the video as part of their Sustainable Foods outcomes and you will be one of the stars. 
If you fancy yourself as a budding food technologist we have a fantastic perk that money can't buy. You will work with our Product Development Manager to help develop a new flavour for our VitaBug Performance Bar range. Our bars use Cricket protein as a natural superfood ingredient. You will be able to suggest possible flavour combinations, receive in development samples of our top picks and then send through your feedback. Your feedback will help us create an amazing new variety that will be in stores around the world. 
A customised diner for 2 using some delicious edible insect ingredients? One of our high level perks includes a dinner for 2 at a restaurant close to you where the chef will create a once in a life time special dinner experience using a variety of edible insects. Your Instagram and Facebook pages will go crazy with LIKES when they see the amazingly unique food that only you get to try. If you are in Australia, you will receive a visit from Skye- So you can chat about all things bugs and if you are not located in Australia, we will organise a Skype call with Skye so you can ask her any questions and get the low down on edible insects as a future food source.






Skye is an Entomologist and Food Scientist  and has been working hard to develop her business breeding insects for human consumption since 2007. If you choose to contribute $2000+ you will receive mentorship for 1 year from Skye. This perk is perfect for the budding bug-entropnenur who is looking to start their own bug based business. Skye's unique combination of skills means she can provide advice on legislation, food labelling and packaging, shelf life, product development, manufacturing, certifications, insect breeding and controls. 

    Global Impact By joining us in our edible insect project, you will not only be helping us take the step from small scale to large scale production of our retail products, you will also be helping normalise insects as a genuine source of protein for our growing population. 


Even the smallest contribution WILL make a difference! 

We have already developed an extensive range products which are ready to hop onto the shelves. These are already available through our online store, and your investment will help us produce these in larger quantities for wholesale orders in our own commercial kitchen. 
By having skills in both Food Science and Entomology, I believe I am the prefect person to introduce edible insects to the world. I will do this by providing tasty, healthy products that can enjoyed by everyone. 

By reinvesting our profits we have been able to establish Australia's first edible insect farm and develop techniques to help make the insects safe to eat. We have also been able to set up our very own commercial kitchen, to make sure we can produce high quality insect based foods using our own staff and equipment. This level of control means we have been able to establish an Australian Made product that is compliant with HACCP and GMP regulations.

Our successful online store has been growing steadily since 2007 and our customer base has grown so big in Australia that we believe the time os right to make our products available on a larger scale.

<h3>In short: Help us transform a community</h3> <p></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>The problem:</b> Globally, the lack of secure sanitation takes
the lives of more than five thousands each day, 90% of them are children under
five years old. In Ecuador, there are 3 million people without access to secure
sanitation; most of them live in rural and semiurban areas where traditional
alternatives are not adequate due to high costs and abundant water consumption. </p></li>
<li><p><b>The solution: </b>To tackle this problem, Fundacion In Terris co-developed and promotes a Decentralized Sanitation Unit (DSU), which includes a pedal-operated ecological toilet that is 100% decentralized, doesn’t require water or energy to operate and transforms human waste into compost. It's comfortable and safe, it's  adequate for rural areas where centralized sewage systems are unavailable or would be too expensive</p></li>
<li>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>A tough reality: </b>There exists a gap between the costs
of adequate sanitation solutions and the capacity of payment of those who
lack access to it. That’s why they tend to use improvised
and unsafe solutions. </p>
</li>
<li><p><b>A community to prove our subsidy+microfinance model:</b> La Unión is a small rural community with 200 families who lack access to adequate sanitation and clean water. They are committed to change their situation by paying a $10 monthly fee to finance 30% of their DSU.</p></li>
<li>
<p><b>Your contribution:</b> To eliminate this gap and finance the remaining 70%, we propose a Mixed Contribution Scheme in which everyone contributes: the local government (subsidy), private companies and YOU, to deliver a DSU to each family that will include the toilet, a urinary, and a rainwater collection system.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div> <h3>The problem</h3>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447979376/kllpogzmx5qbijyqgqur.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>The Decentralized Sanitation Unit provides safe and sustainable sanitation and captures rain water for handwashing. Is a comfortable and safe. It includes the “Taladro de la Tierra” a pedal-operated urine diverting dry toilet which works through an internal auger that oxygenates, dehydrates and mixes waste with sawdust transforming it into plant fertilizer (compost). </p>
<p>An awards winner solution co-developed by Fundación In Terris, Critical Practices LLC and Ambiente Creativo.</p>

USD$10 monthly fee for 20 months. This is a great effort for them, but its only
30% of the total cost of the DSU.</p></span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""></span><p>We think sanitation is a
shared problem. That’s why we are launching this mixed contribution campaign,
in which public institutions, companies, NGOs and small donors will contribute

In short: Help us transform a community 

The problem: Globally, the lack of secure sanitation takes
the lives of more than five thousands each day, 90% of them are children under
five years old. In Ecuador, there are 3 million people without access to secure
sanitation; most of them live in rural and semiurban areas where traditional
alternatives are not adequate due to high costs and abundant water consumption. 
The solution: To tackle this problem, Fundacion In Terris co-developed and promotes a Decentralized Sanitation Unit (DSU), which includes a pedal-operated ecological toilet that is 100% decentralized, doesn’t require water or energy to operate and transforms human waste into compost. It's comfortable and safe, it's  adequate for rural areas where centralized sewage systems are unavailable or would be too expensive


A tough reality: There exists a gap between the costs
of adequate sanitation solutions and the capacity of payment of those who
lack access to it. That’s why they tend to use improvised
and unsafe solutions. 

A community to prove our subsidy+microfinance model: La Unión is a small rural community with 200 families who lack access to adequate sanitation and clean water. They are committed to change their situation by paying a $10 monthly fee to finance 30% of their DSU.

Your contribution: To eliminate this gap and finance the remaining 70%, we propose a Mixed Contribution Scheme in which everyone contributes: the local government (subsidy), private companies and YOU, to deliver a DSU to each family that will include the toilet, a urinary, and a rainwater collection system.  


 The problem




The solution
The Decentralized Sanitation Unit provides safe and sustainable sanitation and captures rain water for handwashing. Is a comfortable and safe. It includes the “Taladro de la Tierra” a pedal-operated urine diverting dry toilet which works through an internal auger that oxygenates, dehydrates and mixes waste with sawdust transforming it into plant fertilizer (compost). 
An awards winner solution co-developed by Fundación In Terris, Critical Practices LLC and Ambiente Creativo.













¿Why do we need your contribution?There exists a gap between the cost of an adequate sanitation solution and what people have in their pockets.


Here is where we propose that all of us join forces to achieve a sustainable solution. We called it MIXED
CONTRIBUTION. It is a shared responsibility, and the benefits impact us all,
that’s why we should all put a piece of the puzzle, even YOU…

This time we will try
our model in La Unión, a small rural community of 200 families. They don’t have
access to drinkable water or sanitation. They depend on fishing, with an
average income of $200 per family per month. They have committed to pay a
USD$10 monthly fee for 20 months. This is a great effort for them, but its only
30% of the total cost of the DSU.We think sanitation is a
shared problem. That’s why we are launching this mixed contribution campaign,
in which public institutions, companies, NGOs and small donors will contribute
to provide adequate sanitation for this community.



To achieve the installation of 50
     toilets, we need USD$42.650. Each Decentralized Sanitation Unit costs
     USD$694,50, which includes the Earth Auger sanitation system and a functional
     housing (see next section). 
Hogar de Cristo, an ONG that provides
     hundreds of houses annually in Ecuador, and Rotary Club, have already
     committed over USD$12.000 in funding. We expect that through a combination
     of funding from local public institutions, private companies and small donors
     such as you, we will achieve an estimate of USD$21.650. This includes the
     transportation and installation of the 50 toilets, plus additional central
     costs (i.e: communication, this campaign, monitoring and documentation
     expenses)
If additional funding is achieved, we
     will be able to donate more toilets to the community. If the required
     funds are not totally gathered, we will install the proportional amount of
     toilets.




¿What will the beneficiary receive?





Each family  will get:

-1 (one) Taladro de la Tierra system

-1 (one) cabin where to install the toilet
-Complementary accessories such as:
   -Cover material supply (sawdust)
   -2 (two) containers for collecting and storing compost
   -1 (one) rainwater collection system
   -1 (one) sink
   -1 (one) urinary

   ¿How we will use funds?

We will deliver a DSU for every $454,30 collected through Crowdfunding+local governments+other donants.
After the 50 units have been reached, 1 toilet will be installed for every $694,30 collected through Crowdfunding+local governments+private companies+other donors. This is because Hogar de Cristo’s funds are only for 50 units.


¿What will you get if you help us  help them?
Every donor will receive a customized digital postcard of the family they helped. A final video will be prepared and sent, in which each family thanks the donors that helped them get a DSU.

Esto es un gran esfuerzo para ellos, pero es sólo el 30% del costo total. 

Contribución mixta
Creemos que el saneamiento es un problema de todos. Es por que proponemos este esquema de contribución mixta, en el que instituciones públicas, compañías, ONG y pequeños donantes podrán contribuir para proveer saneamiento adecuado a estas familias.



Para alcanzar 50 unidades, necesitamos USD$42.650. Cada Unidad de Saneamiento Descentralizado tiene un costo de USD$694,50, valor que incluye el Taladro de la Tierra y una caseta funcional (Ver siguiente sección).


Hogar de Cristo, una ONG que provee cientos de casas anualmente en Ecuador, y el Rotary Club, ya han comprometido más de USD$12.000 en financiamiento. Esperamos que, a través de una combinación de financiamento de instituciones públicas, compañías privadas y pequeños donantes como tú, lograremos un estimado de USD$21.650. Esto incluye el transporte e instalación de 50 unidades, más costos adicionales. (Por ejemplo: comunicación, esta campaña, costos de monitoreo y documentación)

Si se logra recaudar financiamiento adicional a la meta, podremos donar más sanitarios a esta comunidad. Si los fondos requeridos no se completan, instalaremos la cantidad proporcional de sanitarios.









¿Qué recibirá el beneficiario?






Cada familia recibirá:-1 (una) sanitario taladro de la tierra
-1 (una) caseta donde se instalará el sanitario
-Accesorios complementarios como:
   -Material de cobertura
   -2 (dos) contenedores para recolectar y almacenar el abono
   -1 (un) sistema de recolección de agua lluvia 
   -1 (un) lavamanos 
   -1 (un) urinario



¿Cómo van a ser usados los fondos?


Entregamos una unidad por cada  $454,30 colectados a través de Crowdfunding+gobiernos locales+otros donantes.
Una vez que se alcancen 50 unidades, 1  sanitario será instalado por cada $694,30 recaudados a través de Crowdfunding+gobiernos locales+compañías privadas+otros donantes. Esto es porque los fondos Hogar de Cristo’s funds son solo para 50 unidades.


¿Qué recibirás si nos ayudas a ayudarlos?
Cada donante recibirá una postal digital personalizada de la familia a la que ayudó. Un video final será preparado y  enviado, en el que la familia agradece a las personas que le ayudaron a conseguir su sanitario.

<p>Last summer, my dad was preparing for heart surgery. Along with  intense medical questions about whether or not he would want to be resuscitated, he had his own intensely personal questions: Did I live a meaningful life? Did I affect people? </p>
<p>That’s when I realized: we need a space for this. Before the emergency surgery or the retirement, the graduation or the remission, we need a space to let those people in our lives know: You Affected Me. </p>
<p>I spent five years working in hospice, spending time with people in their dying process and learning a heck of a lot about living. I learned that there’s still time… until there isn’t. Don’t wait. It’s never too soon to tell someone how they have positively impacted your life.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our first fundraising goal is $15,000. With that, we could secure the physical space to house The Studio, furnish it, buy the light bulbs, the chairs, and the coffee. We have found a great location big enough to provide classrooms, a dance studio, a sound stage, a recording studio, and a green room.</p>
<p>Of course, that is just the beginning. Anything above and beyond our initial goal will go toward making The Studio bigger and better! State of the art video and recording equipment. Top of the line sprung floors, designed to absorb shock, enhance performance, and reduce the risk of injury.  A Keurig for the Green Room. The ability to provide a wider array of classes with Master instructors in a decked out professional studio space.  </p>
<p>The Studio Creative Group is the only place of its kind in the region. A unique place where you can explore, learn, and perfect your craft in a one stop shop experience designed for all genres of the performing arts, guided and directed by a staff that are truly experts in their fields.  Whether you are gearing up for an audition, exercising your skills in the off season, or simply looking for a fun new hobby, The Studio has you covered! No matter your goals or skill level, you'll find a warm and inviting place to explore and create. </p>
<p>Any funds raised will go directly into making The Studio a reality, in whatever capacity allowed. That may mean subletting a different space, foregoing a green room, sharing a microphone, or trading in our Keurig for an old fashioned coffee pot. But our commitment to the Performing Arts community and providing top notch classes with expert instructors remains. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Any dream or new venture comes with risks and challenges. For The Studio, the biggest challenge we face is a sustainable enrollment in classes. And that's where you come in. We named our company The Studio Creative Group because we truly want this to be a group and a community of passionate artists learning, creating, and having fun together. Right now, The Studio is a ""group"" of two. We want a group of two hundred. By contributing, enrolling in classes, lending your time and expertise, we can overcome this challenge and grow The Studio Creative Group into a true tour de force in the Performing arts community.</p>
<p>We are passionate and hardworking, and have dedicated our lives to learning, creating, and turning ideas into realities. We truly believe that we have a plan and an idea that will revolutionize performing arts in our area, bring people together, and that we can offer an invaluable service to the region. Whether its choreographing dances or making movies, we have relied on intuition, creativity, and hard work to get the job done. And now, we’re reaching out to like-minded individuals to help make this dream a reality.</p>

<p>Klase’ Beauty Supply’s focuses on creating a destination for customers seeking exceptional, quality hair and beauty products. This company prides itself on providing high customer satisfaction by rendering excellent customer service, quality products, and an enjoyable atmosphere for consumers. Coca Chanel said it best, “A girl should be two things Classy &amp; Fabulous.” With there being only one beauty supply store in the Byram area, this company will convenience those who are seeking a beauty supply store that caters especially to their needs and those who can never seem to get off work early enough to catch the beauty supply store before it closes.

<p>I am the owner, Shonte Perry and I have worked diligently to make this business successful. I have acquired a good amount of clientele from advertising the business on social media. I have what it takes to excel beyond the customer's expectations. Klase’ Beauty Supply expects its growing reputation to lead to new clients that support the company’s anticipated growth. In January of this year, I was laid off from my job of 3 years. My mom suffered a heart attack and survived a quadruple bypass surgery, I have faced several challenges this year. After researching and considering the positives over the negatives, I decided to pursue my dream and open my beauty supply store. Many are afraid of the risks and challenges associated with this type of company, but I am up for the challenge. I am very passionate and knowledgeable about the beauty supply industry and eager to acquire many new skills as I travel along this journey.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In addition to the donations received from Indiegogo, I have also started a raffle fundraiser in which I will be giving the winner a Bobbi Boss Wig from the product line that will feature in the store. I am requesting $1000. My total start-up expenses are estimated to be $38,000. However, I have completed the process of drafting a business plan to apply for a line of credit. $450 + $30 app fee = $480 is to take storefront location off the market. The remaining $520 will be put into a business account and used for the purchase of liability insurance and utility expenses. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Beauty Supply Stores have experienced overall growth over the past five years, despite a few bumps in the road during the recession. Rising disposable income levels and new product introductions will continue to support revenue growth moving forward. Nevertheless, competition is on the rise from the Korean and Asian communities. Revenue growth is expected to improve over the next five years, growing at an average annual rate of 3.2% to $58.7 billion. There is a disparity of African American owned beauty supply stores. Many like myself are realizing that upon entering individual stores, many do not have products that cater to our needs and many store owners lack the customer service required to keep customers coming back. I started an online hair extension store and began to generate a lot of consumer support. I decided to stop being the middle man and look for ways to own my store. In the Hinds County MS area, there are several African American Hair Extensions Stores, but none are full beauty supply stores. My goal is to bring Hinds County, its first African American Owned Beauty Supply Store in a great city that is rapidly expanding. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Running a beauty supply store involves long work hours, and it can also be tiring physically, particularly when stock needs moving and re-arranging. Owning any small business in a struggling economy is difficult. But when your passion is beauty and hair care, why not follow it while being able to make a living doing something you love. Sure, getting off the ground is a hassle, but once that initial investment goes through we will be up and running. The fees incurred when maintaining any small business add up as weeks and months progress. Two kinds will typically visit the store: return and walk-ins. The majority of this business may rely on return customers (those who come in and see the same smiling face with exceptional customer service skills every few weeks or months). Having discounts for consumers is a great way to show how you love anyone who gives the store repeat business. Walk-ins are always welcome. There will be display prices near the entrance of the storefront, along with promotions. This process will help attract new business. POS software for beauty supply stores makes keeping records of discounts and promotions incredibly simple. Above all else – beauty supply stores, just like many other small businesses, have to stay hip to current trends. Informing my sales associates of the latest name brand product information will be beneficial in driving up sales. Offering different incentives (door prizes, gift cards, discounts, etc.) will appeal to a variety of my potential customers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I have started a fundraiser raffle, and I am looking forward to in the future generating enough revenue to give back to the community, sponsor programs that help encourage young ladies to be classy &amp; successful. I have a social media platform already set up for my business. I plan to create other strategies to become more active in the company to get consumers a chance to understand that Klase' Beauty Supply, LLC is not just a store we are a community that dares anyone to dream!!

<h3>Fed up with 2-Party Politics?</h3>
<p>We believe in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Breaking up the 2-party system</strong> by modifying our voting to create a wider political spectrum that better reflects you - an american voter. Term limits and ending the ""winner take all"" instant runoff election system in favor of newer, proven and more representative systems.</li>
<li>
<strong>One human, one vote</strong>. We believe government is by and for the people. More money does not deserve more votes. We intend to end super pacs and the policies leading to ""the best government money can buy"". This party will officially prohibit ""super pac"" business contribution.</li>
<li>
<strong>You deserve a voice</strong>. The simple fact is many average voters feel disempowered, disconnected and disgusted with our current political process. This also means government should reflect the citizens at large. This is your chance to make your voice heard.</li>
<li>

<h3>Join the Conversation</h3>
<p>We don't claim to know all the answers. Your voice can be heard and shape policies, then bills and legislation. Unlike a traditional (188 year old (D), 162 year old (R)) political party, all party processes, from selection of official platforms and selection of candidates will be handled online.</p>
<p>This is a political party for today's world.</p>
<p>To make your voice heard, donate as little as $1.</p>
<p>Note as is central to our mission, more donation does not buy you more votes. We'd love for you to donate more, but you'll still get just one vote.</p>
<p>That said, at this state - the exploratory initial conversation - you must donate at least $1 to get involved, and should be a legal voting citizen of the United States.</p>
<h3>What am I Funding?</h3>
<p>All funds at this point will go to research and setup of infrastructure. We'll identify ""swing districts"" - areas of the U.S. that vote either way and may be ""politically in play"". </p>
<p>It is likely to be the 2024 or 2028 election before a presidential candidate is ready, due to the nature of how the current political system works. Our rough timeline is something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediately: Setup of infrastructure with a secure social platform for each contributor to voice their opinion and vote on issues and get involved.</li>
<li>2018: Local candidates in ""swing districts"" are put in place, with substantial online support from the party. This is not a presidential election cycle and thus voter turnout is lower, <i><strong>but that is to our advantage</strong></i>. We believe we can, using technology, help party candidates reach local and state office.</li>
<li>2020: We need a 5% national vote to be included as a major party in the following election cycle.</li>
<li>2024: Serious runs and party recognition for state governments, focused on swing states.</li>
<li>2024 - 2032: Presidential campaign. This won't be attempted until the party has traction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, we know this is ""the long game"", but if we do nothing, what will happen? Do you recall Bush vs. Gore? Obama vs. Romney or McCain? Without action the future is likely to be similar to the past. </p>
<p>We find that untenable, and hope you do too.</p>
<p>Your contribution gets you invited to the 1.0 platform where you'll have an opportunity to vote on candidates and issues within the party. </p>
<p>We've deliberately set the funding amount as low as possible so as to start the conversation. Currently, we have earmarked:</p>
<ul>
<li>First $5,000: Technology and basic legal infrastructure including setup of a legal Non Profit</li>
<li>$5,001 on up: Whatever it takes to start building momentum, beginning with local government in swing areas. This will involve legal, marketing, candidate registration fees or other support. It may also involve outreach to existing legislators to shape bills that put forth our agendas above.</li>

""3rd party voters...dangerous"". (A.) the fact that voting 3rd part is considered ""dangerous"" is a testament to just how broken the current system is. (B.) 3rd party candidates have in fact won on the state level, and in this election, we sort of agree in some way - we, as a party, will not put forth candidates until we have some real momentum - due to the broken ""winner take all"" nature of our current system.</p></div>","Fed up with 2-Party Politics?
We believe in the following:


Breaking up the 2-party system by modifying our voting to create a wider political spectrum that better reflects you - an american voter. Term limits and ending the ""winner take all"" instant runoff election system in favor of newer, proven and more representative systems.

One human, one vote. We believe government is by and for the people. More money does not deserve more votes. We intend to end super pacs and the policies leading to ""the best government money can buy"". This party will officially prohibit ""super pac"" business contribution.

You deserve a voice. The simple fact is many average voters feel disempowered, disconnected and disgusted with our current political process. This also means government should reflect the citizens at large. This is your chance to make your voice heard.

It's time for Government 2.0. Within the party, we intend to use technology first to shape party policies, voter engagement, and increase efficiency as never before. This also means tax reform, and the coming unemployment boom caused by disproportionate technology ownership.

Workers need protection. In the war between Labor vs. Capital, we believe capital - investors and big business - has already won. Government is the only way to re-balance power.

The question is, do you believe this too?

Every revolution started somewhere...
Every major revolution in history started by a group with one key ingredient: belief. 
The United States started with a revolutionary small group who decided it was time to ""leave the nest"" of Great Britain. At that time, it was easy to dismiss it. 
Our battle is not with guns - but with hearts and minds. 
Who are we?

Two brothers, from a blue and red state and point of view, but neither happy about the lack of choices:

Roger, an internet marketer and developer in Los Angeles, CA (a firmly ""blue state"")
Tracy, an aviation engineer and former police chief in Minneapolis, MN and having run for local office with the Republican party.

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>With the introduction of the new eZ generation, some work was done to support the extension as a field type.

<p>Since the eZ Platform UI has started to be used recently, there is a need to support tag management on the UI level too. </p>

</div><div>
<p>We will need to invest a significant amount of hours to extend the functionalities of Tags Bundle for eZ Platform UI, hence we require funding. The first rough estimations show that we need 150 hours just for the implementation, some hours for open sourcing it, etc.</p>
<p>The results of the effort will be these 3 features: </p>

<h3>The Basic Summary</h3>
<p>The idea behind Walt's Box was born out of a constant need to send our friends and family the staple goodies from our visits to Walt Disney World. Anyone from around the Disney area of Florida knows how valuable it is having the parks from your doorsteps to find gifts for others (and well, let's be honest -- yourself!) We were constantly sending goodies through the mail to our loved ones around the country. We started to make ""WDW care packages"" for our families that had all types of WDW merchandise inside.</p>
<p>The problem came when we found out so many of our friends wanted those same goodies from the Parks and we had NO clue what some of them really wanted. So we came up with the idea of Walt's Box.</p>
<p>Walt's Box is a subscription box that contains hand-picked goodies from all four parks as well as the resorts of Walt Disney World. From the limited edition T-Shirts from the Magic Kingdom and the decadent and off-the-wall candies from the Japan Pavilion in Epcot to the hand-made soaps from the Grand Flordian and everything in between, we want to spread the happiness and joy of the Walt Disney World resort to all those around the country.</p>

<p>My sons have been asking if they could rake the neighbors leaves or mow lawns and start their own business, but were sad to learn, as they asked the neighbors around us, that lawn services had already been filled by other kids in the area.  However, when they saw me watching the promo video for Drone Command they immediately became interested, and wanted to know more, and if that was a business that kids could do.  Well I honestly wasn’t sure, so I emailed the Drone Command people and asked them if it was age appropriate for my sons to attend.  They assured me that it was a great business for young entrepreneurs, and even referred me to a couple of other young participants who had attended their events.  I quickly contacted one of them and they also confirmed that this was a business that could be really interesting and exciting for kids to be a part of and develop.  This led to several discussions --- if they were serious about wanting to try this --- and how dedicated they would be to the work it would take.  They all assured me that this was absolutely something they found interesting, exciting, and wanted to learn more about.  I certainly want to feed this industrious spirit but we are not able to outright fund such an adventure, thus the boys suggested that they wanted to try fundraising.  Again, I told them I would help, and that is what led to this video.  In the video I asked them a few basic questions: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why they wanted to start a business? </p>
<p>Why they like Drones?</p>
<p>Why they thought it would be a good business? </p>
<p>What would some of their business goals be? </p>
<p>Why should people give them money to start this business?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope you will enjoy the video, please forgive my poor video skills.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The goals they came up with are $3000 to cover the expenses in attending a nearby Drone Command event, a Drone, and some startup business expenses.</p>
<p>The larger goal of $5000 that would help them get more flight training, marketing options, and a website.</p>

People ask all of the time, how did I get started in coffee. Honestly, I was at a time in my life when I wanted to be happy. I learned from a Buddhist Monk, like seriously a monk, that if even if I wasn't happy inside, I could find joy in bringing others joy, </p><p>I thought to myself that even if people didn't drink coffee, the smell of coffee, always seemed to make people smile. There's not a person that I could think of, that didn't find a bit of joy around coffee. My first tagline for Darrin's Coffee was, ""Best enjoyed among friends."" </p><h3> </h3><h3>My first ""giver"" moment.</h3><p> </p><p>On Thanksgiving 2012, I had maybe 35lbs of coffee to my name and I learned that the Mozel Sanders Foundation was short of their fundraising goal. I didn't have much, but I felt compelled to donate 30lbs to the Mozel Sanders Thanksgiving Meal. </p><p>It's a huge event, where a lot of hungry people get fed. After that, we changed the tagline to, ""Everyone deserves to drink great coffee.""</p><p>I knew about<strong><span style=""color: #3366ff;""><a href=""https://darrinscoffee.com/education/direct-trade-coffee-definition/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #3366ff;""> Direct Trade and Fair Trade</a></span></strong>. There's a difference. So, when I decided to buy coffee, I reached out to a farm in Costa Rica. They used coffee to provide jobs opportunities to people in the area. Then, Haiti had an earthquake. In looking for a way to use coffee to help, I was able to establish a relationship with a nonprofit, probably the most transparent one in Haiti, and I began buying and roasting their coffee. I'm one of their channel partners now. <span style=""color: #3366ff;""><strong><a href=""https://singingrooster.org/campaigns/matthew/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #3366ff;"">Check me out</a></strong></span>.</p><p>Most don't know that at one time Haiti was the second largest coffee producing country in the world. Now, because of major calamities, about 4% of the entire country is forested. The nonprofit I purchase from not only has coffee that's the Haitian Cup of Excellence Winner, they plant a tree for every pound of unroasted coffee that I purchase. I want to buy as much coffee from them as possible. I also want to come full circle to the farm in Costa Rica, the first Direct Trade coffee purchase I made and buy coffee from them as well. </p><p>I saw that there was a need for young black men to learn entrepreneurship, so I decided to start a program to teach entrepreneurship to these boys. In addition to that program, I began an additional program to teach a younger group about the fundamentals of group economics.</p><h3> </h3><h3>I know I am blessed. </h3><p> </p><p>I am the only Black Owned Coffee Roaster in the State of Indiana. I plan on using that Diversity Status to sell some coffee and create some jobs. My plan includes leveraging coffee to help those with disabilities as well as those with felony backgrounds earn a living. I believe that if the coffee is good and the people around the coffee are the same, it is impossible for anything but good to be the result. I am only one guy on a mission. So here I am. The giver, becoming the asker. I need your help. </p><p> </p><h3>What am I asking?</h3><p> </p><p>I know A LOT of people. I believe that if enough of the people that know me, they know my story and they know why I do what I do, when I ask for their help in accomplishing this goal, they won't hesitate in helping. I've lost a lot of friends just by asking them to buy coffee from me. (Crazy right?) That's why I've been hesitant to start this project. This is bigger than me. It always has been.

People ask all of the time, how did I get started in coffee. Honestly, I was at a time in my life when I wanted to be happy. I learned from a Buddhist Monk, like seriously a monk, that if even if I wasn't happy inside, I could find joy in bringing others joy, I thought to myself that even if people didn't drink coffee, the smell of coffee, always seemed to make people smile. There's not a person that I could think of, that didn't find a bit of joy around coffee. My first tagline for Darrin's Coffee was, ""Best enjoyed among friends.""  My first ""giver"" moment. On Thanksgiving 2012, I had maybe 35lbs of coffee to my name and I learned that the Mozel Sanders Foundation was short of their fundraising goal. I didn't have much, but I felt compelled to donate 30lbs to the Mozel Sanders Thanksgiving Meal. It's a huge event, where a lot of hungry people get fed. After that, we changed the tagline to, ""Everyone deserves to drink great coffee.""I knew about Direct Trade and Fair Trade. There's a difference. So, when I decided to buy coffee, I reached out to a farm in Costa Rica. They used coffee to provide jobs opportunities to people in the area. Then, Haiti had an earthquake. In looking for a way to use coffee to help, I was able to establish a relationship with a nonprofit, probably the most transparent one in Haiti, and I began buying and roasting their coffee. I'm one of their channel partners now. Check me out.Most don't know that at one time Haiti was the second largest coffee producing country in the world. Now, because of major calamities, about 4% of the entire country is forested. The nonprofit I purchase from not only has coffee that's the Haitian Cup of Excellence Winner, they plant a tree for every pound of unroasted coffee that I purchase. I want to buy as much coffee from them as possible. I also want to come full circle to the farm in Costa Rica, the first Direct Trade coffee purchase I made and buy coffee from them as well. I saw that there was a need for young black men to learn entrepreneurship, so I decided to start a program to teach entrepreneurship to these boys. In addition to that program, I began an additional program to teach a younger group about the fundamentals of group economics. I know I am blessed.  I am the only Black Owned Coffee Roaster in the State of Indiana. I plan on using that Diversity Status to sell some coffee and create some jobs. My plan includes leveraging coffee to help those with disabilities as well as those with felony backgrounds earn a living. I believe that if the coffee is good and the people around the coffee are the same, it is impossible for anything but good to be the result. I am only one guy on a mission. So here I am. The giver, becoming the asker. I need your help.  What am I asking? I know A LOT of people. I believe that if enough of the people that know me, they know my story and they know why I do what I do, when I ask for their help in accomplishing this goal, they won't hesitate in helping. I've lost a lot of friends just by asking them to buy coffee from me. (Crazy right?) That's why I've been hesitant to start this project. This is bigger than me. It always has been. So the giver is now the asker.  I'm not asking for a lot. Am I? Whenever I am asked for a donation from my business, space to hold a function and even when I'm not asked, my answer is not just yes, but, how can I help more. I want to be the community guy that happens to own a coffee shop. Not the other way around. What scares me about asking you for help? When I asked for donations to help start my entrepreneurship program, my post received A TON of ""Likes"". Sadly, the grand total of donations was $23. I suppose that was another reason that's kept me from asking again. Remember, I've lost friends by just asking them why have they never bought any coffee from me. But this is bigger than me.  Just put ""Five on it"". My ask is that my family, you guys help with at least $5, and if you give more, I've added perks. I'm also asking that you bring three people that you know love giving and understand the impact this will make. RIGHT HERE IN INDIANA! (Remember, this is not only going to help someone in another part of the world, a tangible economic benefit locally is the result. Give globally, benefit locally. Wow.)Outside of that, I'm not asking for anything else. I actually spent more than $5 for lunch last week.

<p><strong>WHO I AM</strong></p>
<p>I am Henry Nnorom, a young entrepreneur. I developed my brand after seeking out an alternate solution to my father’s affliction for a simple ailment. Modern medicine wasn’t giving me the results I needed. I found that alternative medicine was more useful and my father responded better to unconventional healing.</p>
<p>The term ""Juju"" has been in existence since the dawn of humankind. It is derived from the pursuits of men looking for small inanimate objects to ward off evil both spiritual and physical. I also found that there are millions of people around the globe who look to juju as a form of healing, and who rely on the gifted crafts that men and women make, such as little trinkets and amulets, to ward off sickness and unhappiness through an energy which believers relate to.</p>
<p>I believe in what I do and I love my business as much as I love my family, Culture, American food, and helping people and that is A LOT.</p>
<p>Harthrup.com is the first startup that I HAVE CREATED. It helps people to sell or buy a business, meet new partners, post to find new workers for their start up and eventually build a successful start-up. Hathrup.com takes the technological advancements of today and mixes them with the philosophy and ideals of the American Dream of yesterday.  Our goal is to turn Hathrup.com into an app that will facilitate crowd funding, start-up, and political news. Our aim is to bring unedited and informational news in real time by you the users straight to your mobile device. We hope through your help to empower young start-ups reach potential donors and much more.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS JUJU MARKETPLACE?</strong></p>
<p>Juju Marketplace is an open platform for HANDMADE arts and crafts that connects buyers and sellers from around the globe. Our marketplace is unique because it allows sellers to list and sell items that they’ve made from home, including juju products. Since its launch, the website has seen over 4000 visitors and that rate is growing daily! People from all walks of life have taken an interest in this modern marketplace for handmade items. Although I coined the name “Juju Marketplace” out of my own love and respect for these ancient art forms, the website does not solely intent to promote Juju products. Rather, it is a place for HANDMADE and UNIQUE HANDCRAFTED GOODS- connecting artisans and collectors.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMPANY</strong></p>
<p>Juju Market Place LLC is currently a Wyoming Registered company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hathrup Capital Funding. Over the years, Juju Marketplace.com has grown to be more than an online store. We have launched the “free enterprise” Juju consulting portal seller app as the first of its kind. It is listed on Google Play Store for Android devices and facilitates leads for sellers and buyers in the juju niche market. The app has been downloaded thousands times to date, challenging Juju Market Place.com to introduce a more sophisticated marketing system.</p>
<p>It supports people in countries and cities where juju is practiced for good and not evil. It is also not only commendable, but entrepreneurial as a form of giving financial opportunities to people less fortunate and thereby allowing growth and success for many.</p>
<p>People ask us all the time: ""What kind of start-up related to Juju is it possible to launch?"" Generally, this market is not openly accessible to the community. However, though our website, the market place is growing exponentially around the world.  JMP is in the right place with the right information and application to put a good working plan into action and achieve financial results. I created this company out of the philanthropic desire to assist people in countries and cities where juju is practiced for the experience of positive energy. Therefore, this is not only commendable, but also entrepreneurial as a form of giving financial opportunities to people less fortunate and thereby allowing growth and success for many.</p>
<p>As Juju Market Place.com has grown over the past year, so has its fan base, including those who have hoped for the opening of branch outlets in different cities and countries. Since we can’t achieve this on our own, we’ve decided to seek your help to make that idea a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY WE NEED YOU</strong></p>
<p>With an appropriate funding, JMP will be able to open branch outlets in Texas, South Africa, and Ghana. The opportunity to build a business platform, expand, and nurture the relationship between makers and buyers is reliant on being able to upgrade continually, and source products and market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HELP US REACH MILLIONS</strong></p>
<p>While seeking out an alternative solution to my father’s disease, I interviewed the most successful, notable and innovators leaders of our time. Many of them have been deeply impacted by Juju’s energetic powers.</p>
<p>Today, you have the opportunity to put jujumarketplace.com to work worldwide. By supporting this project, you will be among the first ones to benefit from our handmade arts and crafts and you will be helping to spread good Juju beliefs and positive energy around the globe.</p>
<p>Now is the time to join and help us spread good vibes and forces around the Globe!</p>
<p>You are fully aware of the impact of ""Juju"" on our society and with even a modest donation you will be helping people to get through their bad days. We need to make everyone in need aware that even when we think we have lost everything, it is not over. We need to show them that there is still some hope and that they got something to hang on to while the world still spins on. A little piece of art craft that for you may be only that, for someone else might be the determination to never give up in the face of adversities.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $100,000, which will be used to bring this project to life. Here is a summary of the project budget:</p>
<p>Office in Bastorp, Texas- $15.000,00</p>
<p>Local sales people (x3) PART TIME- $20.000,00</p>
<p>Marketing material- $8.500,00</p>

<p>Operating expenses (promotional items)- $10.000,00</p>

<p>Advertising- $10.000,00</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Juju is more than a belief system. It's about healing- the body, the mind, the soul. Take a step back and envision a world without stigmatization, without relying on radiation for cancer, or without the injection of one virus to fight another virus. Juju holds the key to an alternative medicine that has existed since the beginning of time but people still hold traditional medicine on a pedestal- despite its ineffectiveness!</p>

structured summer programs. Many of these students, especially in South LA,
haven't had formal music or arts education, don't have access to the latest
technology, and don’t have the opportunity to participate in many educational
field trips. Additionally, they aren’t exposed to what's behind-the-scenes of
the music they hear, the TV they watch, nor the video games they play.
Choice Group Inc. (CGI) programs
provide outlets for creative expressions, classroom instruction, and exposure
to industry professionals, and experiential field trips, CGI participants learn
foundational competencies that are transferable to any setting. Choice

<p><strong>About us</strong></p>
<p>In may 2013, we started the project “Momento Dulce” in our house kitchen. The idea was to combine our family’s most traditional and delicious recipes with some, most modern ingredients in order to have a unique product with an incomparable taste and freshness.</p>
<p>We offered our products to different restaurants and little by little many others joined our client list as we increased production and variety along the way, always keeping our original recipes, freshness and homemade flavor.</p>
<p>""Momento Dulce"" started trending locally thanks to satisfied clients, friends and family. We started offering our sweets for every occasion and are currently being offered all over the city.</p>
<p>Social media has been essential to our growth; we’ve been able to increase our exposure beyond the range of direct influence, as well as offering promotions, deliveries and other alliances with different companies. It’s our window to followers and costumers who greatly enjoy everything we offer.</p>
<p>Although our plan is to export our products worldwide, our current goal is to succeed in the national market. We know our own limitations due to the increasing demand in the local market.</p>
<p><strong>Next Step</strong></p>
<p>With your support we plan to reach further. First, by acquiring new equipment and workspace; this will allows us to increase our production and guarantee adequate storage and preservation. Second, we want to increase our range of action through paid advertisement which will helps us expand even more our reach.</p>
<p>Local products are key in the development of our project. The quality of our products is guaranteed by the high quality of the products made locally. Also, we want “Momento Dulce” to be known by its high appreciation for local producers and their products.</p>
<p>At Momento Dulce we care about the environment and that’s why we want to develop environmental-friendly packages and wrappers using recycled materials, which not only are high quality but also helps to reduce the carbon print.</p>
<p>We want to go beyond and follow new healthy trends like creating a line of deli, gluten and lactose-free products with natural ingredients with guaranteed flavor and quality.</p>

<p>VivaFlow is a company dedicated to solving the fresh water
scarcity problem in developing countries by purifying water from bodies of contaminated salt water.  Only 1% of Earth’s water is drinkable and the
remaining 99% is stored in glaciers and the ocean, with over 1.2 billion people unable to access clean drinking water, In addition, more than 80 percent of disease in developing countries is linked to poor sanitation in water sources. We want to offer these 1.2 billion people a product that can provide them with freshwater despite the condition of the original water source. Developing coastal regions
have convenient access to the ocean, but don’t have the means to filter the
salts to make it drinkable, leaving them to resort to dirty and dangerous water from contaminated and disease infested sources. VivaFlow's first mission is to target coastal communities in Haiti, a country prone to natural disasters and water scarcity. We hope our technology can provide relief day to day and during the aftermath of natural disasters, when obtaining water can be a primary difficulty.</p>
<p>Our business creates a simple technology to desalinate and
eliminate impurities in brackish and sea water. Our goal is to make such a system small, portable,
and convenient to use, without relying on external energy sources or expensive materials.</p>

aim to reach out to individuals, co-operatives and charitable organizations

<h3>What is Panga?</h3>
<p>To start with, the word 'panga' in Panama means a small, artisanal fishing boat traditionally used by fishermen on both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. This boat is the modest backbone of the country's fish supply. Due to our restaurant's location, it became super obvious how dependent we are, as well as this country is, on the labor of pangas + pangeros (he who fishes in a panga).  'Panga' then became a metaphor for the methods of our grandparents, methods that fed generations of people -- and methods that are unfortunately disappearing because of this world's need for convenience. </p>
<ul>
<li>Chef Andrés Morataya started his academic career in comercial engineering but never saw a passionate future in it. He soon found himself in the sweaty doors of a kitchen for work and knew that he this was where the root of his passion would grow. He started a humble restaurant in the quaint town of Pedasí, Panamá where eventually, he was introduced to the Prince of Liechtenstein and worked for him for 5 years as a chef. Working with the Prince inspired Andres' thirst for knowledge -- as the Prince encouraged him travel to different countries to learn various techniques and forms of cooking. Andrés eventually found love (shout-out to Tuira) and relocated to Panama City, Panamá where marriage and a family soon followed. He was introduced to the mythical Manolo Caracol - a Spanish chef with many years in Panama, who really pioneered the idea of value in local products. Andrés worked as head chef for 2 years at Manolo Caracol -- which is where he found himself as a cook, taking his global knowledge of techniques and making them personal to his cuisine, using local ingredients and genuinely embracing a philosophy connected to the farm. </li>
<li>Our campaign is about raising the funds needed to make our restaurant into something bigger than itself; <u>the funds will allow us to reach the full potential of our project</u>. Right now, PANGA is a farm-to-table restaurant that needs help in acquiring the materials and equipment necessary to make it as self-sustaining as possible. We want to be able to turn 1 product into 20 and for that, we need special tools. These tools will in turn allow us to form a larger connection to the community and its local producers. Today, we make cheese for ourselves but in the near future, we want a local producer to have the incentive to make cheese for us. The classic restaurant model typically creates X amount of jobs but if we help <i>empower people</i> from the local community, we not only create jobs but we also weave long-lasting impact into the fabric of their livelihoods. </li>
<li><strong>We collaborated with our friends from <a href=""http://www.shootsarahtyler.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fox Den Productions </a>to make a<i> </i>short film that truly expresses our mission in its multilayered form. We wanted to bring people not only to PANGA but also to Panamá, a beautiful country with so much culinary potential. </strong></li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul><li>We need to raise <strong>$41,915 </strong>to truly get PANGA on its feet and mission-worthy. The costs of equipment and their shipment to Panama will heavily rely on all of your donations!<ul>
<li>
<strong>Meat Grinder:</strong> <strong>$700</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Refrigerated Cold Work Station: $1,990</strong> <strong>-</strong> It's a hot climate and we want to keep all of our seafood fresh -- it's imperative to create a reliable station that does just so.</li>
<li>
<strong>More Refrigeration: $2,500 - </strong>An entire cow or hog are not small things to store. We will need all of the refrigeration devices and space we can afford. We will also be able to dry-age and cure meats with such a set-up.</li>
<li>
<strong>Back-Up Generator:</strong> <strong>$3,300</strong> <strong>-</strong> Electricity is not reliable when you live in the middle of nowhere so we need a good generator that will keep our inventory and business nice and safe.</li>
<li><strong>Sausage Maker: $240</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Whole Hog Smoker: $3,400</strong> <strong>-</strong> This piece of gear also requires wheels and a trailer; we want to be able to bring PANGA to other destinations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Water Filtration and Carbonation System:</strong> <strong>$4,000</strong> <strong>- </strong>We want to make sure we can offer the best possible water to you as well as reduce plastic bottle usage. We also want to make our own sodas with seasonal fruits and avoid the use of commercial sodas.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tools and Equipment:</strong> <strong>$2,500</strong> <strong>- </strong>Out here in the Azuero Peninsula, we are a long way from home and a tool store -- and thus, require other types of equipment for construction. We don't only make food ourselves but sometimes we have to make tables, paint walls, re-wire lights, etc, so our toolbox has to be on steroids.</li>
<li>
<strong>Bread Oven: $3,000</strong> <strong>- </strong>A good, reliable oven is needed in every kitchen.</li>
<li>
<strong>Used Pick-Up Truck: $15,000 - </strong>Many of our local providers do not own cars and only travel by horse -- so we have to go to the product and bring it back to PANGA. There have already been times where we couldn't purchase something because we couldn't arrange the transportation. This will allow us to bring whatever we find interesting back to PANGA and create something special for our clients in larger quantities (<i>wink, wink</i> <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/RicardoPerezSA"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Ricardo Perez, S.A.</u></a></strong>)</li>
<li>
<strong>Raised Beds and Chicken Coop: $3,285 - </strong>We buy worm humus from a local farmer while we wait for our compost to be ready! Our raised beds are huge and we need a lot of soil to fill them up. The chicken coop and the rest of the raised beds will be made with different types of local wood and assembled by us but the materials aren't cheap -- between the wood, milling of it, and other structures needed to maintain the garden.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Round Table: $2,000 - </strong>This table is something we're really looking forward to seeing finished. It will be built onsite due to the weight and size. This table will need to have personality as it will be the heart of PANGA. Here we will serve our tasting menu and it will act as PANGA's vessel, pushing the boundaries on locally-sourced ingredients. Fixed price, no menu, just sit down and enjoy the 7-10 course meal!</li>

To start with, the word 'panga' in Panama means a small, artisanal fishing boat traditionally used by fishermen on both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. This boat is the modest backbone of the country's fish supply. Due to our restaurant's location, it became super obvious how dependent we are, as well as this country is, on the labor of pangas + pangeros (he who fishes in a panga).  'Panga' then became a metaphor for the methods of our grandparents, methods that fed generations of people -- and methods that are unfortunately disappearing because of this world's need for convenience. 

Chef Andrés Morataya started his academic career in comercial engineering but never saw a passionate future in it. He soon found himself in the sweaty doors of a kitchen for work and knew that he this was where the root of his passion would grow. He started a humble restaurant in the quaint town of Pedasí, Panamá where eventually, he was introduced to the Prince of Liechtenstein and worked for him for 5 years as a chef. Working with the Prince inspired Andres' thirst for knowledge -- as the Prince encouraged him travel to different countries to learn various techniques and forms of cooking. Andrés eventually found love (shout-out to Tuira) and relocated to Panama City, Panamá where marriage and a family soon followed. He was introduced to the mythical Manolo Caracol - a Spanish chef with many years in Panama, who really pioneered the idea of value in local products. Andrés worked as head chef for 2 years at Manolo Caracol -- which is where he found himself as a cook, taking his global knowledge of techniques and making them personal to his cuisine, using local ingredients and genuinely embracing a philosophy connected to the farm. 
Our campaign is about raising the funds needed to make our restaurant into something bigger than itself; the funds will allow us to reach the full potential of our project. Right now, PANGA is a farm-to-table restaurant that needs help in acquiring the materials and equipment necessary to make it as self-sustaining as possible. We want to be able to turn 1 product into 20 and for that, we need special tools. These tools will in turn allow us to form a larger connection to the community and its local producers. Today, we make cheese for ourselves but in the near future, we want a local producer to have the incentive to make cheese for us. The classic restaurant model typically creates X amount of jobs but if we help empower people from the local community, we not only create jobs but we also weave long-lasting impact into the fabric of their livelihoods. 
We collaborated with our friends from Fox Den Productions to make a short film that truly expresses our mission in its multilayered form. We wanted to bring people not only to PANGA but also to Panamá, a beautiful country with so much culinary potential.

Our Mission
WIN Workplace Solutions is a mother/daughter team working to produce a dedicated private and portable room for employers to provide to moms that need to pump breastmilk at work. 

Our product will make an impact by giving millions of moms who pump breastmilk at work equality of access to the resources that they need to continue breastfeeding after returning to work. This is a necessary effort because 49% of working women who breastfeed report that their work situation directly impacted their decision to quit. That 49% bears a strong resemblance to the 50% of women that pump in a bathroom. WIN is determined to change this. A woman should only quit breastfeeding if she wants to. 
We're calling our product The Corner Office because we believe that every woman is the executive of her life.
WIN also plans to make an impact by hiring single parents and paying them a thriving wage. Children of single parent families are four times as likely to experience poverty. Our commitment to paying a thriving wage will empower single parents to support their families.
We know that it will take time and determination to get our product to the point where we are able to manufacture it ourselves, but creating jobs is a top priority for WIN.

In 2015, winners received over $50,000 in cash and pro-bono prizes.

<div align=""center"">
<span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Short Summary</span><br/>
</div> <p>Happy Pooch Canada will be the first company in Canada to manufacture and sell hydroponically real grown grass to consumers that own pets. Our main focus is pet owners residing in Condos/Apartments. </p>
<p></p>
<p>      </p>
<p>            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445393040/qvqqvmze4ztgvdpilndh.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 523px; height: 523px;""/></p>
<p>Think about this, dogs are naturally attracted to grass to urinate/defecate on. We will manufacture grass hydroponically (without the use of soil) to consumers for their pets. Its great for consumers that; work long hours, go out for several hours a day, have bad winters, senior's who own dogs, are training their dog, own or work with doggie day care centres, and more! Every year we have a plan in place to expand our marketing strategy with different advertisement implementations, we have ambitious plans to improve our product and to distribute our product more!        <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Product/Service Summary<br/>
</h3>
<p>Hydroponically grown grass means that our grass is grown without the use of soil, its main ingredient is ""Water"". We use a sponge infused with Coco Liner as our medium for the grass growth, this helps as a natural feel for dogs as well as provide a protective absorbent layer. We will offer two models for consumers to choose from; Basic Model (18"" by 24"") $28.95 or XL Model (2.4 ' by 4' feet) $39.77. These are typically chosen by the size of the dog. If consumers own a small breed of dog, they will choose our Basic Model. If consumers own a medium-large breed of dog, they will choose our XL Model. Our models are 12-22% bigger than any other competitors in the U.S.A. <br/><br/><br/></p>

<br/>We will update on Indiegogo when our product becomes available and ready to be shipped.</div>

<p><br/></p>
<p>There are no companies in Canada that offer hydroponically grown grass for doggies!</p>
<p>The beauty of our business is we will offer a continuous delivery plan in which consumers can choose a bi-weekly or monthly subscription. We will automatically charge their credit card/paypal account and ship out their chosen model. This will help busy dog owners with the convenience of a new ""Happy Pooch"" real grass patch without having to keep re-ordering. </p>

And we love that :). So, whatever you contribute, we thank you in advance for believing in us.</div><div><br/></div>
<h3>                                    The Impact</h3><div>In Canada, there is no product like what we're going to manufacture. There is no Real Grass for pets that is hydroponically grown. The only options in Canada for pets is Synthetic Grass, Pee Pads (Wee Wee Pads), and Soil-Based Grass (Only in Vancouver, BC). So my question to you is, will you as a human being urinate or defecate anywhere but the toilet? The answer is NO, so why should our dogs do their ""business"" on anything else but, what their naturally attracted to? Our product is the best there is out there. Dog's are naturally attracted to ""Real Grass"" so, why not give it to them? We grow our grass with our hydroponic method and instead of soil we use a sponge infused with coco liner. This gives dogs a ""dirt"" feel, but in fact is just a sponge medium. Not only that, but it gives our product a secondary absorbent protection from urine. </div><div>
<p></p>
<p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444618535/gsfhtfepnzbxsfq28aox.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>Looks like dirt? Well, its not, that is a sponge infused with coco liner (Coconut ""Hair"").</i>
</div><div>
<br/><p>I have a Yorkshire Terrier and I always leave her home for several hours a day. So, my problem was I always worried about my dog being at home without anywhere to go pee. She doesn't use synthetic grass and she rips up pee pads. So, I thought, well how about I grow some real grass and put it in a box for her. I started doing some research and found out about the hydroponic growing method. So, I started my own experiment and grew a patch and ""WOW"" she used it. I was so happy and pleased and feel so assured when I'm at work. So, I thought, why isn't there a product like this out there in Canada? That's when I started working on a company and voila, behold Happy Pooch Canada. Fresh Hydroponically Grown Grass for Your Pet!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<div align=""center""><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;"">How We're Different</span></div>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<p>In Canada, our competitors are; synthetic grass (Fake Grass), Pee Pads (Absorbent Paper Pads), and Soiled-Grass Patch (Only in Vancouver, BC).</p>
<p>Our product is better and this is why:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Soil-Less</strong> (Hydroponically Grown: All we use is our sponge/coco liner medium, grass seeds, water, and vitamins)<p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444622032/huecdaclhv5y3tqippxf.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 501px; height: 334px;""/></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>10 x More Absorbent </strong>(Natural grass absorbs more than synthetic or pee pads, our hydroponic method also enriches the grasses absorbing effect. In the grasses entire growing life it is in water, and because of this it is even more super absorbent to any liquid, including urine. Our medium is also another extremely absorbent layer. Not enough? How about a water-resistant box as another precaution. That means you won't have any urine on the floor or on the balcony.)<p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444622116/lfia2897liqncbyuzwkv.png"" src="""" style=""width: 508px; height: 508px;""/></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>95% Less Odour than any competitor</strong> (Because of the high absorbency from our hydroponic growing method, our natural living grass also eliminates almost all odors that comes from urine. Synthetic/Pee Pads generally have only 0-15% absorbency but, there is no odour eliminator, thus having high levels of odour from urine.)<p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444622153/k6fr6qlwq6uksdy4n2yc.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 509px; height: 509px;""/></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Best for Puppy Training</strong> (Dog's are naturally attracted to ""<i>Real Grass</i>"". So, they should be trained on ""<i>Real Grass</i>"". This helps them get ready to be walked outside by their owner and not urinate on bed sheets, carpets, and hardwood floors. Research  has shown that Pee Pads often mislead puppies into thinking bed sheets or hardwood floors are the same.)
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445113015/zuf482obwatyhcmx0m0m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>No Mess, No worms</strong> (No Soil = No Mess and No Worms! Our hydroponic method eliminates mess and worms that arise from soil-grown grass.)</li>
<li>
<strong>Bio-Degradable </strong>(Our product is 100% Bio-Degradable. That means owners simply throw the entire unit down the garbage shoot. Yup, it's that simple!)</li>
<li>
<strong>Easy, Easy, Easy!</strong> (Our product is designed to be very user-friendly and easy. Consumers simply choose a plan, receive the package and place on the floor. When the new unit arrives, they simply discard the old unit and replace with the new!)        </li>

</div><div> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our only challenge is we can't sell our product in-store. So, you can't walk into a Pet-Smart or Pet-Valu and see our product. Our sale platform is only online but, don't worry, that's not a problem because we already have a plan in place. 6 months after we launch, we will be launching our In-Store Marketing/Sales Operation. Our plan is not to sell our product to stores but, instead, sell our <i>Gift Cards</i> to stores. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Customers, while waiting to cash out in line, will see our gift cards on the rack. They can buy the gift card and order from our website, we then will ship them our product. With that guess what, we won't have to pay any Shelf Space Premiums! This encourages in-store costumers to also sign up and choose a subscription plan for future orders. </span><br/></p>

Short Summary
 Happy Pooch Canada will be the first company in Canada to manufacture and sell hydroponically real grown grass to consumers that own pets. Our main focus is pet owners residing in Condos/Apartments. 

      
            
Think about this, dogs are naturally attracted to grass to urinate/defecate on. We will manufacture grass hydroponically (without the use of soil) to consumers for their pets. Its great for consumers that; work long hours, go out for several hours a day, have bad winters, senior's who own dogs, are training their dog, own or work with doggie day care centres, and more! Every year we have a plan in place to expand our marketing strategy with different advertisement implementations, we have ambitious plans to improve our product and to distribute our product more!        

Product/Service Summary

Hydroponically grown grass means that our grass is grown without the use of soil, its main ingredient is ""Water"". We use a sponge infused with Coco Liner as our medium for the grass growth, this helps as a natural feel for dogs as well as provide a protective absorbent layer. We will offer two models for consumers to choose from; Basic Model (18"" by 24"") $28.95 or XL Model (2.4 ' by 4' feet) $39.77. These are typically chosen by the size of the dog. If consumers own a small breed of dog, they will choose our Basic Model. If consumers own a medium-large breed of dog, they will choose our XL Model. Our models are 12-22% bigger than any other competitors in the U.S.A. 
                Small Dog Owners (Basic Model)
$99 CAD - Receive Our Basic Model Bi-Weekly for 2 Months ($143 Value)
$226 CAD - Receive Our Basic Model Bi-Weekly for 6 Months ($347 Value)
$515 CAD - Receive Our Basic Model Bi-Weekly for 1 Year ($858 Value)

          Medium-Large Dog Owners (XL Model)
$142 CAD - Receive Our XL Model Bi-Weekly for 2 Months ($204 Value)
$405 CAD - Receive Our XL Model Bi-Weekly for 6 Months ($623 Value)
$739 CAD - Receive Our XL Model Bi-Weekly for 1 Year ($1,230 Value)

Canadian Residences will receive free shipping, as we are a Canadian Based  Company. United States contributors will have to pay a $7-$11 Delivery fee
We will update on Indiegogo when our product becomes available and ready to be shipped.


There are no companies in Canada that offer hydroponically grown grass for doggies!
The beauty of our business is we will offer a continuous delivery plan in which consumers can choose a bi-weekly or monthly subscription. We will automatically charge their credit card/paypal account and ship out their chosen model. This will help busy dog owners with the convenience of a new ""Happy Pooch"" real grass patch without having to keep re-ordering. 
                                                 


What We Need & What You Get
We are seeking $320,000 for the start of our business. The funding will go into purchasing equipment, supplies, early-staffing and marketing. If we don't reach our goal of $320,000, we need a minimum of $280,000 to grow into our fullest potential. We will make this product huge all over Canada and we have plans to grow into China and the U.K. in the future. 



    We need contributors like you to help us start our future success!


Our Charity (Perks)



$5 Perk - Will get you mentioned in our ""Special Thanks"" weekly post on our Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr page! We will mention your First and Last name.   
$10 Perk - We will donate one Basic Model to a senior. Many seniors that own a dog face the problem of taking their dog out or having no one to take their dog out for them. So help us, help them! We will be working together with Retire-At-Home Services for this project. Your name will also be mentioned in our Special Thanks post in our social media pages.


$15 Perk - There are so many homeless people out there with dogs. And their beloved companion needs to eat too. One of our top priorities is helping dogs who need assistance. For this $15 contribution, we will donate a bag of dry dog food to the Peoples Animal Welfare Society. Your name will also be mentioned in our Special Thanks post in our social media pages.

We care a lot about people who require a service dog, that's why we will donate 5% of our raised funding to Canadian Service Dog Foundation! With each contribution, you are helping us make people and doggies happy everywhere! And we love that :). So, whatever you contribute, we thank you in advance for believing in us.
                                    The ImpactIn Canada, there is no product like what we're going to manufacture. There is no Real Grass for pets that is hydroponically grown. The only options in Canada for pets is Synthetic Grass, Pee Pads (Wee Wee Pads), and Soil-Based Grass (Only in Vancouver, BC). So my question to you is, will you as a human being urinate or defecate anywhere but the toilet? The answer is NO, so why should our dogs do their ""business"" on anything else but, what their naturally attracted to? Our product is the best there is out there. Dog's are naturally attracted to ""Real Grass"" so, why not give it to them? We grow our grass with our hydroponic method and instead of soil we use a sponge infused with coco liner. This gives dogs a ""dirt"" feel, but in fact is just a sponge medium. Not only that, but it gives our product a secondary absorbent protection from urine. 

     
Looks like dirt? Well, its not, that is a sponge infused with coco liner (Coconut ""Hair"").

I have a Yorkshire Terrier and I always leave her home for several hours a day. So, my problem was I always worried about my dog being at home without anywhere to go pee. She doesn't use synthetic grass and she rips up pee pads. So, I thought, well how about I grow some real grass and put it in a box for her. I started doing some research and found out about the hydroponic growing method. So, I started my own experiment and grew a patch and ""WOW"" she used it. I was so happy and pleased and feel so assured when I'm at work. So, I thought, why isn't there a product like this out there in Canada? That's when I started working on a company and voila, behold Happy Pooch Canada. Fresh Hydroponically Grown Grass for Your Pet!


               


How We're Different


In Canada, our competitors are; synthetic grass (Fake Grass), Pee Pads (Absorbent Paper Pads), and Soiled-Grass Patch (Only in Vancouver, BC).
Our product is better and this is why:


Soil-Less (Hydroponically Grown: All we use is our sponge/coco liner medium, grass seeds, water, and vitamins)     


10 x More Absorbent (Natural grass absorbs more than synthetic or pee pads, our hydroponic method also enriches the grasses absorbing effect. In the grasses entire growing life it is in water, and because of this it is even more super absorbent to any liquid, including urine. Our medium is also another extremely absorbent layer. Not enough? How about a water-resistant box as another precaution. That means you won't have any urine on the floor or on the balcony.)     


95% Less Odour than any competitor (Because of the high absorbency from our hydroponic growing method, our natural living grass also eliminates almost all odors that comes from urine. Synthetic/Pee Pads generally have only 0-15% absorbency but, there is no odour eliminator, thus having high levels of odour from urine.)     


Best for Puppy Training (Dog's are naturally attracted to ""Real Grass"". So, they should be trained on ""Real Grass"". This helps them get ready to be walked outside by their owner and not urinate on bed sheets, carpets, and hardwood floors. Research  has shown that Pee Pads often mislead puppies into thinking bed sheets or hardwood floors are the same.)



No Mess, No worms (No Soil = No Mess and No Worms! Our hydroponic method eliminates mess and worms that arise from soil-grown grass.)

Bio-Degradable (Our product is 100% Bio-Degradable. That means owners simply throw the entire unit down the garbage shoot. Yup, it's that simple!)

Easy, Easy, Easy! (Our product is designed to be very user-friendly and easy. Consumers simply choose a plan, receive the package and place on the floor. When the new unit arrives, they simply discard the old unit and replace with the new!)        


Strategy & Implementations 
Our plan is to establish our manufacturing facility as soon as possible. Facility set up will require 30 days to complete and another 12 days to have inventory prepared and ready to ship. When the inventory is established and ready to ship, we will then implement our full marketing and advertising strategy to get our product out, as well as create awareness to generate orders. We will update on Indiegogo for contributors who ordered perks. 
During our facility set up we will also organize our manufacturing team, distribution team, and customer service team. We will conduct training to our staff, educating them on the product and our manufacturing and distribution process.

Challenges
 Our only challenge is we can't sell our product in-store. So, you can't walk into a Pet-Smart or Pet-Valu and see our product. Our sale platform is only online but, don't worry, that's not a problem because we already have a plan in place. 6 months after we launch, we will be launching our In-Store Marketing/Sales Operation. Our plan is not to sell our product to stores but, instead, sell our Gift Cards to stores. 
Customers, while waiting to cash out in line, will see our gift cards on the rack. They can buy the gift card and order from our website, we then will ship them our product. With that guess what, we won't have to pay any Shelf Space Premiums! This encourages in-store costumers to also sign up and choose a subscription plan for future orders.

</div></div>","We heard how so many of you wished there was a place for a dog like yours to safely play, learn and socialize. That’s why we’ve specially designed this nearby 10-acre facility in Romulus to give dogs and their owners a much-needed new option. The property is purchased, the plans are drawn, and the first phase of development is ready to begin--now we need you to help us make it happen.

Because there are no ordinary dogs.  PRO K-9 is an innovative dog training and behavior modification company devoted to maximizing the human-canine relationship through individualized, affordable, results-focused in-home and social training programs. Our mission is to keep dogs in their homes by educating owners and equipping them with the skills and continued support needed to create balanced companions. 
Since 2001, we've helped thousands of dogs throughout Southeast Michigan achieve their training goals. We work with dogs of all breeds, temperaments and backgrounds, with a primary focus on rehabilitating dogs with behavior issues. As the dogs we work with strive for their training goals, many may have limited options for safe spaces to exercise, extra-curricular activities, and overnight boarding. Dog parks can be dangerous, day cares require temperament testing, and many boarding facilities can be a stressful environment for dogs who lack confidence.
Our goal is to bridge that gap with a home-based facility offering a safe haven and productive space for owners and rescues to continue improving their dogs' social confidence at an appropriate pace.



 



Acres of fun for every dog. Like a gym membership for your dog! Each space is specially designed for maximum safety while you enjoy exercising and building your dog’s confidence through a variety of activities in a natural setting. Available for hourly rental by members, our fully secured activity yards ranging from 1-5 acres feature agility equipment, pond and dock, play structures, hiking trails and everything you need. Our training room is also available for rental, and our online booking calendar makes it easy to come play on your schedule. A Behavior Consultant will always be on site to advise and assist members with their dogs.  
What every breed needs. In addition to the private-use activity yards, our facility will provide the space and equipment necessary for additional training, socialization and activities to expand and round out our canine curriculum. Members will receive discounted tuition rates on training classes, private sessions and activity clinics. 




It takes a village.
This isn't your typical fundraising campaign. At PRO K-9, we value our community and rescue roots, and truly admire the rescue ""boots on the ground"". We're eager to support their efforts by sharing our time, resources and expertise.

İlk gününden itibaren mekan sponsoru olarak Workinton (Urban Station) 'ın büyük desteği var, onlara çok teşekkür ediyoruz. Daha çok Bilkentlinin etkinliklerden haberdar olması ve bu sayede daha fazla mezunun tanışabilmesi için sosyal medya reklamları yapıyoruz. Bu ve benzeri harcamaları cebimizden karşılamaya çalıştık. Bundan sonrası için de aynı şekilde sponsorlukların artarak devam etmesi için çabalıyoruz. Kampanyanın amacı buluşmalardaki konuşmaların, sunumların online ortamda video olarak tutulabilmesi ve daha çok kişiye ulaşması. Bu sayede hem gelemeyenler, hem de farklı şehirlerdeki mezunlar her ayın sunumuna ulaşabilecek. Bu sebeple ihtiyaçlarımızı listeledik:</p>

</div></div>","Altıkırk Buluşmaları nedir? Hangi amaçla düzenlenir?
 Altıkırk Buluşmaları, Bilkent mezunlarının birbirleriyle etkileşimini artırmaya yönelik organize edilen ve kar amaçlamayan networking etkinliğidir. Aylık devam eden etkinlik serilerinde Bilkent mezunları birbirini tanıma fırsatı buluyor, her ay farklı konuda bir sunum dinliyor ve düşüncelerini paylaşıyor.
2014 Mayıs ayında bir grup Bilkent mezunu arkadaş olarak CM serilerinden etkilenerek buluşmaları düzenlemeye başladık.
Amaç: Bilkent mezunlarının birbirini tanımasını ve birbirine destek olmasını sağlayacak oluşum eksikliklerinin giderilmesi, herhangi bir organizasyon, dernek veya benzeri bir yapıya gerek duymadan kendi insiyatifleriyle maddi beklenti gütmeden gerçekleştirilebilmesi.
Bugüne kadar: Yaklaşık 2 yıl süresince İstanbul'da yaşayan Bilkentlilere ulaşmayı amaçladık ve buluşmaları aylık düzenledik. Her ay farklı bir konuda Bilkentli konuşmacılar ağırladık.




   


20 Buluşma
500+ Katılım
2.000 Takipçi
İstanbul'da yaşayan yaklaşık 4.000 Bilkent mezununa ulaştık. (LinkedIn ve Facebook reklamları, İşletme Fakültesi mezun database)

Peki neden kampanya başlattık? Tüm gereksinimleri sponsorluklar üzerinden sağlamaya çalışıyoruz. İlk gününden itibaren mekan sponsoru olarak Workinton (Urban Station) 'ın büyük desteği var, onlara çok teşekkür ediyoruz. Daha çok Bilkentlinin etkinliklerden haberdar olması ve bu sayede daha fazla mezunun tanışabilmesi için sosyal medya reklamları yapıyoruz. Bu ve benzeri harcamaları cebimizden karşılamaya çalıştık. Bundan sonrası için de aynı şekilde sponsorlukların artarak devam etmesi için çabalıyoruz. Kampanyanın amacı buluşmalardaki konuşmaların, sunumların online ortamda video olarak tutulabilmesi ve daha çok kişiye ulaşması. Bu sayede hem gelemeyenler, hem de farklı şehirlerdeki mezunlar her ayın sunumuna ulaşabilecek. Bu sebeple ihtiyaçlarımızı listeledik:


  Mikrofon Kamera
Sosyal medya reklamları

Önemli:



Eğer kampanya hedefine ulaşamazsak kalan miktarı kendimiz sağlamaya çalışacağız

Eğer kampanya hedefinin üzerine çıkarsak;1500$ - v3: Farklı şehirlerde de buluşmaların başlaması (ilk aşamada Ankara, San Fransisco, Londra)2500$ - v4: Mobil uygulama (Etkinliğe katılanları görmek, iletişime geçebilmek,
Bilkentliler arası iş ilanı, duyuru vb, ücretsiz online hızlı etkileşim)


Nasıl destek olabilirim?
   

Sonunda ne olacak? Belki de hepimizin okurken ve sonrasında arkadaş sohbetlerinde sıkça şikayet ettiğimiz Bilkent aidiyetinin organik olarak artmasına katkı sağlayacağız.  Daha fazla Bilkentli birbirini tanıyacak
İş birlikleri kurup, birbirine sahip çıkacak
Fikirler geliştirecek
Farklı konularda uzman isimler tanıyacak
Düşüncelerin global olarak yayılmasını sağlayacak


Olası Riskler ve Sorunlar
Tüm bu hedeflere engel olabilecek veya risk taşıyan faktörleri incelediğimizde büyük engel görünmüyor ancak olabilecek engelleri ve mezunlar derneği, okul yönetimi olmadan neden böyle bir çalışma yapıyoruz sorusuna açıklık getirelim:

Buluşmaların gerçekleşebilmesi için takım olarak kişisel zamanlarımızı ayırıp efor harcıyoruz. Buna engel oluşturacak faktörler ortaya çıkar (hastalık vb.) ve buluşmalar gerçekleştirilemez ise bu kampanyadan elde edilen gelirle aldığımız tüm ekipmanı Bilkent Üniversitesi Mezunlar Merkezi'ne bağışlayacağız. Eğer ekipmanlara ihtiyaç duyulmazsa satıp İşletme Fakültesine veya üniversiteye maddi bağış yapacağız.
İşletme Fakültesi başta olmak üzere Tiyatro Bölüm yönetimi tanıtım faaliyetleri için çok önemli destek sağladılar. Mezunlar derneği de çalışmalarımızı yakından takip etti ve benzer etkinlik serilerini bünyelerinde yapmaya çalıştılar.

<p>If you've gotten this far, you likely believe food is an important part of our society. You may be wondering why a food hub deserves your consideration. Fair enough. In order to continue to fuel the growth of our local food economy, farmers’ capacity to efficiently move large quantities of food to urban markets must improve. The hubs will serve as drop-off sites for farmers, providing shared cold storage and the option for pickup by buyers, cross-docking for a third party buyer or distribution services. </p>

There's no alternative crossing up or downstream for a long way. Until Boxing Day 2015, hundreds of people crossed the bridge every day - on foot and by bike - to visit the church, explore the woods and exercise children and dogs. The bridge was also the only way one person, Graham Wilson, got to his home.</p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to fund a temporary footbridge to maintain 200 years of access across the river Calder at Copley for anyone who wishes to cross.</p>
<p></p>

Graham restored the Toll House and has lived there since 1999. He is now in his mid-60s and has Parkinson's disease. The Toll House is on the far side of the bridge from Copley and without a temporary bridge, Graham cannot get to his home.</p>
<p></p>
<b>What do we want to achieve?</b><p>We want a temporary footbridge over the Calder at Copley within three weeks. It's an immediate, locally organised solution to the problem of the current bridge being washed away.

<p><b>How are we going to achieve it?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are working with a number of British manufacturers and suppliers of temporary bridges to find the quickest and most cost effective solution. </p>

The bridge over the river Calder at Copley stood from 1831 to Boxing Day 2015 when it was washed away by flooding. It's been an important river crossing for generations. The bridge was originally part of a turnpike route used to move livestock. From the mid-19th century it was crossed by factory workers to get from Akroyd's model village at Copley to St Stephen's Church. There's no alternative crossing up or downstream for a long way. Until Boxing Day 2015, hundreds of people crossed the bridge every day - on foot and by bike - to visit the church, explore the woods and exercise children and dogs. The bridge was also the only way one person, Graham Wilson, got to his home.
The purpose of this campaign is to fund a temporary footbridge to maintain 200 years of access across the river Calder at Copley for anyone who wishes to cross.

Who are we?Our dad, Graham Wilson, lives in the old Toll House which collected tolls for the bridge in the 19th century. Graham restored the Toll House and has lived there since 1999. He is now in his mid-60s and has Parkinson's disease. The Toll House is on the far side of the bridge from Copley and without a temporary bridge, Graham cannot get to his home.

What do we want to achieve?We want a temporary footbridge over the Calder at Copley within three weeks. It's an immediate, locally organised solution to the problem of the current bridge being washed away. A temporary bridge will allow Graham to live in his home and allow people to cross the Calder at Copley as they have done for 200 years.
How are we going to achieve it?

We are working with a number of British manufacturers and suppliers of temporary bridges to find the quickest and most cost effective solution. 
Why do we need your help?
Large areas of the Calder Valley and further downstream have been devastated by the floods. Calderdale Council has a growing list of urgent infrastructure replacements. A new bridge is on the list, but Copley and Graham need a temporary footbridge right now.
Graham can make a significant contribution to the cost of installing a temporary bridge, but he needs financial and practical support to ensure a temporary bridge is installed quickly. He needs your support to make an unanswerable case to the Council for giving permission for and helping to fund a temporary bridge.
Why is the target £10,000?
It will take at least a week to establish the exact cost of a temporary bridge, but we need to start  fundraising and sharing this story now. We have set a £10K target  because, together with Graham's own contribution, we think it will be sufficient to cover the installation of a temporary bridge.
What if we don't hit the target?
We'll negotiate with the Council and campaign for it to contribute what is necessary to get the temporary bridge installed.
What if raise more than the target?
Once the temporary bridge is in place, the focus will shift to a new permanent bridge. Any extra funds raised will be used to ensure Copley gets a new bridge as good as the old one. Every penny raised will only ever be spent on a bridge at Copley.
Why can't the Council pay?
It's a good question. The Council might be able to pay, but Copley and Graham need a temporary bridge now and we don't want the project to get bogged down with funding issues. If the Council do come through, we'll reallocate all funds raised as above.
Risks and challenges?
The companies we are working with have installed hundreds of bridges previously, across the UK and beyond. It will then fall to the Council to give the necessary consents and offer financial support. We hope this fundraising campaign will be the foundation for that,  we hope it will send a clear message that the temporary footbridge is an immediate necessity for Graham, Copley and the wider community.

</h3> <p></p>
<p>I’m Sarah
Proudlock, owner of The Tea Girl. I love tea!! 5 years ago, I
took the opportunity to bring my vision for bringing people together with tea to
Edmonton by reviving the decade old Steeps location off of 124<sup>th</sup> Street.
It needed many things to keep it from closing, but mostly we needed to shift
focus back to the customers and community. With eager new staff, and customer
support we restored the bustling shop. 2 years ago, we rebranded from Steeps to
The Tea Girl, to reflect our local focus and accountability to our community.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our tea
community continues to grow, and as such changes again are coming to The Tea Girl!
Recently the space next to our shop became available and we have the
opportunity to expand into a bigger little tea shop, while still offering the
same amazing service and quality and maintaining the cozy environment our
customers love.<span>  </span></p>
<p>We need your help! We have already begun renovations and we hope to have
everything finished by March, just in time for spring teas. We are looking to our community here in Edmonton, and those that visit
from a far, to help support our dream of growing a local meeting place into
something even better.<span>  Please help us to
reach our goal and we will continue to bring more Edmontonians together over a
cup of tea.</span></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are looking to the community to help raise $10,000, which is about one quarter of the renovation costs. We will use the funds to purchase kitchen equipment, like a new oven and prep tables, and new counters for us to work on. We are hoping to purchase a bar fridge and new seating for our customers to use in the expanded space.</p>
<p>We are offering backers tea incentives like free tea or ways to take home your favourite tea cup. If you contribute before March 15, you are invited to our Grand Re-opening party on Wedneday, March 16th!<br/></p>
<p>Every dollar helps to keep us moving forward with this expansion, regardless of how much we raise.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Changes are coming!<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>The main
attraction to expanding is additional space, for you, our loyal customers, to ponder
over a pot of your favourite tea. If you have ever tried to visit on a Sunday
afternoon, you know the tea house can get quite full and can be hard to find a
table. With more prime front window space, we are hoping more tea lovers can
meet up even at our busiest times. We even get to add more miss matched
furniture to our collection.</p>
<p>We are also
looking forward to the addition of a kitchen where we can now bake all our
cakes and cookies in store increasing our selection of fresh baked items. We
took our first steps towards offering our own product in August when our
friends at Whimsical Cake Studio offered a space in their kitchen to bake of
our some desserts. We look forward to more tasty creations.</p>
<p>We also are
adding a 2<sup>nd</sup> bathroom, which gives our tea drinkers much relief. We
know you love our current bathroom so it stays as is. More seats and amenities
also let us look forward to the future where other beverage pairings may be
added to our menu.</p>
<p>We are
increasing our staff work area. Not too big though, just enough that we don’t
trip on each other every other moment. After all, we have grown quite close and
may get lost with too much elbowroom.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Even if you can't donate, you can still help! Share our campaign on social media and tell your friends! We are still open during renos and we would love to see you visit us for tea and see our progress! Mind the noise and make sure you keep checking back to see when the big reveal day is!</p>

community continues to grow, and as such changes again are coming to The Tea Girl!
Recently the space next to our shop became available and we have the
opportunity to expand into a bigger little tea shop, while still offering the
same amazing service and quality and maintaining the cozy environment our
customers love.  
We need your help! We have already begun renovations and we hope to have
everything finished by March, just in time for spring teas. We are looking to our community here in Edmonton, and those that visit
from a far, to help support our dream of growing a local meeting place into
something even better.  Please help us to
reach our goal and we will continue to bring more Edmontonians together over a
cup of tea.
  What We Need & What You Get We are looking to the community to help raise $10,000, which is about one quarter of the renovation costs. We will use the funds to purchase kitchen equipment, like a new oven and prep tables, and new counters for us to work on. We are hoping to purchase a bar fridge and new seating for our customers to use in the expanded space.
We are offering backers tea incentives like free tea or ways to take home your favourite tea cup. If you contribute before March 15, you are invited to our Grand Re-opening party on Wedneday, March 16th!
Every dollar helps to keep us moving forward with this expansion, regardless of how much we raise.
  Changes are coming!
 
The main
attraction to expanding is additional space, for you, our loyal customers, to ponder
over a pot of your favourite tea. If you have ever tried to visit on a Sunday
afternoon, you know the tea house can get quite full and can be hard to find a
table. With more prime front window space, we are hoping more tea lovers can
meet up even at our busiest times. We even get to add more miss matched
furniture to our collection.
We are also
looking forward to the addition of a kitchen where we can now bake all our
cakes and cookies in store increasing our selection of fresh baked items. We
took our first steps towards offering our own product in August when our
friends at Whimsical Cake Studio offered a space in their kitchen to bake of
our some desserts. We look forward to more tasty creations.
We also are
adding a 2nd bathroom, which gives our tea drinkers much relief. We
know you love our current bathroom so it stays as is. More seats and amenities
also let us look forward to the future where other beverage pairings may be
added to our menu.
We are
increasing our staff work area. Not too big though, just enough that we don’t
trip on each other every other moment. After all, we have grown quite close and
may get lost with too much elbowroom.   Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't donate, you can still help! Share our campaign on social media and tell your friends! We are still open during renos and we would love to see you visit us for tea and see our progress! Mind the noise and make sure you keep checking back to see when the big reveal day is!

<p>We're L'atypique Craft Cidre, the UK's hottest hand made, craft drink brought direct to you from France's oldest producers.</p>
<p>One day, whilst managing my pub, leisurely sipping London micro brew beer, I gots a thinking, ""why has cider not been invited to the party?"" So then I gots a looking and, sure as, some of London's hottest venues were serving the most fantastic small batch artisanal beers, next to mass produced commercial cider. So finally I gots a doing and realised the answer was there all along....The answer to cider is CIDRE!</p>
<p>So I popped over to Normandy and was blown away by what I found. There I spotted over 30 small orchards containing their own craft artisans,  producing some of the most delicious ciders (or cidre, as we should say!), taking painstaking care of every stage, from growing the apples to bottling the finished product. This isn't a fad to them, they've been doing this for many hundreds of years, and it's organic to boot! </p>

This combination of local culture and natural wonders is a key part of what makes a visit to Dilijan so memorable.</p><p><strong>Supporting Ecotourism &amp; Conservation:</strong> From designing new trails to renovating and maintaining existing routes to keep them accessible and safe, a community of dedicated people and organisations continues to improve the trail experience for visitors of the park. We won't just be local advocates for their goals but give our guests the opportunity to support them – perhaps even volunteering to help – and making our hostel available as a headquarters for those involved with trail building and maintenance.  </p><p>Among the many organizations whose enormous efforts we will continue to support, here are some of the most prominent:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>The Transcaucasian Trail (TCT): </strong>The TCT is establishing a world-class long-distance hiking trail more than 3,000km in length, following the Greater and Lesser Caucasus Mountains and connecting roughly two dozen national parks and protected areas in the region, including Dilijan National Park.

<strong>HIKEArmenia: </strong>HIKEArmenia is a non-profit NGO developing hiking infrastructure in Armenia and sharing the country's trail potential with the world, and has supported the development of Dilijan National Park's trail network for several years.

Access to trails is only footsteps away, as well as transportation to get you further into the park. Beyond getting outdoors, we urge you to experience a taste of Dilijan’s local culture through its restaurants, cafes, and markets – all within just a few minutes' walk.</p><p><strong>Knowledgeable Staff:</strong> The Dilijan Hikers Hostel team will be there to welcome you and help you get the most out of your experience. In addition to providing maps, sharing knowledge and advice, and helping you prepare for your time in Dilijan National Park, we’ll be there to recommend which trails you and your group will enjoy the most, no matter what your fitness or skill level.</p><p><strong>Clean and Safe Facilities:</strong> A safe and clean environment is our top priority – not just taking extra precautions during the Covid-19 pandemic but ensuring a well-maintained communal living environment at all times. Peace of mind for our visitors is of utmost importance and we’ll be working hard to demonstrate this. </p><p><strong>Supporting Local Trails:</strong> Dilijan Hikers Hostel will directly support the local trail network by hosting volunteer trail maintenance events, providing tools and facilities, and donating a portion of its profits back to the Transcaucasian Trail. We will be the first of many affiliated businesses that will help ensure the future of TCT. </p><p><strong>Promote Environmental Awareness:</strong> We want to be a part of maintaining the health of Dilijan’s ecosystem. Providing educational material to guests and highlighting the fragility of our surroundings will ensure that we all do our part in fostering a community of low-impact travelers. </p><p><strong>Having Fun!</strong> What’s better than coming back from a long hike, taking a hot shower, and opening a bottle of beer with new friends? The hostel will be designed from the ground up as a communal environment where guests can share experiences and make new and unforgettable memories.</p><h3><strong>Why Build Dilijan Hikers Hostel <u>Now</u>?</strong></h3><p>The year of 2020 will go down in history for turning people's plans upside down and inside out – but we've all learned to adapt! One of the effects is that we anticipate a much higher number of local travelers in 2021. As and when the pandemic draws to an end, we expect to see the international community coming back to Armenia as more and more people resume their travel plans. We will be taking all the necessary steps to ensure the safety of our guests, while at the same time nurturing our hostel's potential for the future.</p><h3><strong>Alright, Let's Talk Money. Where Will The Funds Go?</strong></h3><p>We are lucky enough to have been donated the use of an old townhouse in the heart of Dilijan which will be converted into a hostel – but it needs some work! With one big effort this spring, we’ll be able to outfit the building to the high standards of comfort, safety, and sanitation so often lacking in Armenia. This project will require a couple of major renovation projects, along with a lot of volunteer help, and of course the tools and materials for DIY projects and furnishings. We also want ensure we can pay our local staff a fair salary from Day One.</p><p>Here’s a breakdown of what needs to happen between now and opening day:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618276631/qsd0zuqwdu64stppzrao.png"" src=""""/></p><p>In a bit more detail:</p><p><strong>Reception &amp; Information Area:</strong> We want guests of our hostel to have access to extensive information about the trail network and the local area so they feel their time in Dilijan has been well spent. A number of DIY projects will be involved in creating a communal reception and information area for this to happen.</p><p><strong>Outdoor Roofing:</strong> It sounds like a big job...and it is! A new roof over our terrace and entranceway is certainly something we'll be hiring local contractors to build, but when finished, will guarantee that our guests can enjoy cooking, dining and hanging out in the fresh mountain air – even when it's raining!</p><p><strong>Outdoor Kitchen &amp; Dining:</strong> Hikers love being outdoors, and in the time of Covid-19 it's best for safety too. So we'll provide a full outdoor kitchen and BBQ area to both bring people together and keep everyone safe. Summer in Dilijan is best spent with mornings soaking up the sun, days out on the trail, and evenings by a campfire, and that's exactly what we'll provide.</p><p><strong>Security:</strong> Peace-of-mind is essential in any communal environment. So we'll be installing security cameras, building private lockers, and encolsing the property with a secure gate and fence. At the same time we'll create a keyless entry system for our guests.</p><p><strong>Pavements:</strong> You know what’s not fun after tramping through the dirt all day? More dirt. A hikers' hostel needs to be the clean end-point of a long day on the trails. We’ve redesigned the access routes to our hostel with this in mind, and now we need the funds to build it.</p><p><strong>Plumbing:</strong> After a day out on the trails, there’s nothing you’re looking more forward to than a hot shower – and nothing worse than it running cold when someone turns on the tap in the kitchen! We'll be redesigning the building's plumbing to make sure this doesn't happen, and that everyone has hot and cold water when and where they need it.</p><p><strong>Electrical Installation:</strong> Old buildings in Armenia have often been wired... well, questionably. At the same time, today's travelers often pack a huge array of power-hungry devices. So we'll be outfitting the building with a brand new electrical system – critical for safety, and with the convenience of our guests a top priority.</p><p><b>Large Appliances: </b>Especially on a multi-day hike, laundry is a critical service for any hiker stopping over in a town like Dilijan. We'll be procuring a new and efficient washing machine that's up to this arduous task, along with a separate drying machine for rainy days (and there are plenty of those in Dilijan!).</p><p><strong>Air Conditioning &amp; Ventilation:</strong> As well as being essential for comfort in the summer months, good ventilation is critical for hygiene in any communal living space.</p><p><strong>Business Operations:</strong> There's also plenty to do behind-the-scenes, including creating a booking system, website development, advertising, overhead costs, and salaries for our local staff. The complete guest experience is vital to the success of this venture, and we want to make it smooth and effortless.</p><p><strong>Emergency Funds:</strong> This is a big project with lots of variables, and that means having a contingency fund for when things don't quite go to plan. We've built a buffer into our budget so we're confident in being able to weather any sudden storms during our critical first year of operations.</p><h3><strong>Perks for Donors</strong></h3><p>Dilijan Hikers Hostel thanks you ahead of time for the contributions you make. Despite the limitations of this past year, we are expecting a high number of local tourists and want to ensure they have a clean and comfortable place to seek shelter in. Our commitment to serving our local community will be the foundation for this ever-growing project and we invite you to be a part of our journey! </p><p><strong>Pre-Book Your Stay: </strong>Summer is around the corner and soon we'll be rushing outdoors and planning some fun trips. Here's your chance to book your stay at Dilijan Hikers Hostel ahead of time and have a guaranteed spot available for you when you arrive in Dilijan. Whether you're pre-booking one night or more, alone or with friends, this is a great opportunity to plan ahead, receive lots of add-ons and a special thank you from us. </p><p><strong>Sponsoring the Local Community: </strong>A core objective for creating Dilijan Hikers Hostel is giving back to the trail network that brings us our guests! We invite you to help us by sponsoring trail clean-up days, trail-building events, and inviting local hikers to join us in exploring Dilijan National Park. Your efforts won't go unnoticed and you can expect to receive a special thank you from us and everyone who benefitted from your donation.</p><p><strong>Merchandise: </strong>In addition to handwritten thank-you cards, We'll also be rewarding our donors with beautifully crafted maps of Dilijan National Park.

We won't just be local advocates for their goals but give our guests the opportunity to support them – perhaps even volunteering to help – and making our hostel available as a headquarters for those involved with trail building and maintenance.  Among the many organizations whose enormous efforts we will continue to support, here are some of the most prominent:

The Transcaucasian Trail (TCT): The TCT is establishing a world-class long-distance hiking trail more than 3,000km in length, following the Greater and Lesser Caucasus Mountains and connecting roughly two dozen national parks and protected areas in the region, including Dilijan National Park. Visit https://transcaucasiantrail.org


HIKEArmenia: HIKEArmenia is a non-profit NGO developing hiking infrastructure in Armenia and sharing the country's trail potential with the world, and has supported the development of Dilijan National Park's trail network for several years. Visit https://hikearmenia.org


Trails for Change (TFC): Born around the campfire during a volunteer trail-building camp in Dilijan National Park, the mission of TFC is to design, build and maintain a network of trails that span all of Armenia. Visit https://www.trailsforchangengo.org

 Here's How Dilijan Hiker's Hostel Stands OutLocation: With our location being right in the heart of picturesque Old Dilijan, a traveler couldn’t ask for anything better. Access to trails is only footsteps away, as well as transportation to get you further into the park. Beyond getting outdoors, we urge you to experience a taste of Dilijan’s local culture through its restaurants, cafes, and markets – all within just a few minutes' walk.Knowledgeable Staff: The Dilijan Hikers Hostel team will be there to welcome you and help you get the most out of your experience. In addition to providing maps, sharing knowledge and advice, and helping you prepare for your time in Dilijan National Park, we’ll be there to recommend which trails you and your group will enjoy the most, no matter what your fitness or skill level.Clean and Safe Facilities: A safe and clean environment is our top priority – not just taking extra precautions during the Covid-19 pandemic but ensuring a well-maintained communal living environment at all times. Peace of mind for our visitors is of utmost importance and we’ll be working hard to demonstrate this. Supporting Local Trails: Dilijan Hikers Hostel will directly support the local trail network by hosting volunteer trail maintenance events, providing tools and facilities, and donating a portion of its profits back to the Transcaucasian Trail. We will be the first of many affiliated businesses that will help ensure the future of TCT. Promote Environmental Awareness: We want to be a part of maintaining the health of Dilijan’s ecosystem. Providing educational material to guests and highlighting the fragility of our surroundings will ensure that we all do our part in fostering a community of low-impact travelers. Having Fun! What’s better than coming back from a long hike, taking a hot shower, and opening a bottle of beer with new friends? The hostel will be designed from the ground up as a communal environment where guests can share experiences and make new and unforgettable memories.Why Build Dilijan Hikers Hostel Now?The year of 2020 will go down in history for turning people's plans upside down and inside out – but we've all learned to adapt! One of the effects is that we anticipate a much higher number of local travelers in 2021. As and when the pandemic draws to an end, we expect to see the international community coming back to Armenia as more and more people resume their travel plans. We will be taking all the necessary steps to ensure the safety of our guests, while at the same time nurturing our hostel's potential for the future.Alright, Let's Talk Money. Where Will The Funds Go?We are lucky enough to have been donated the use of an old townhouse in the heart of Dilijan which will be converted into a hostel – but it needs some work! With one big effort this spring, we’ll be able to outfit the building to the high standards of comfort, safety, and sanitation so often lacking in Armenia. This project will require a couple of major renovation projects, along with a lot of volunteer help, and of course the tools and materials for DIY projects and furnishings. We also want ensure we can pay our local staff a fair salary from Day One.Here’s a breakdown of what needs to happen between now and opening day:In a bit more detail:Reception & Information Area: We want guests of our hostel to have access to extensive information about the trail network and the local area so they feel their time in Dilijan has been well spent. A number of DIY projects will be involved in creating a communal reception and information area for this to happen.Outdoor Roofing: It sounds like a big job...and it is! A new roof over our terrace and entranceway is certainly something we'll be hiring local contractors to build, but when finished, will guarantee that our guests can enjoy cooking, dining and hanging out in the fresh mountain air – even when it's raining!Outdoor Kitchen & Dining: Hikers love being outdoors, and in the time of Covid-19 it's best for safety too. So we'll provide a full outdoor kitchen and BBQ area to both bring people together and keep everyone safe. Summer in Dilijan is best spent with mornings soaking up the sun, days out on the trail, and evenings by a campfire, and that's exactly what we'll provide.Security: Peace-of-mind is essential in any communal environment. So we'll be installing security cameras, building private lockers, and encolsing the property with a secure gate and fence. At the same time we'll create a keyless entry system for our guests.Pavements: You know what’s not fun after tramping through the dirt all day? More dirt. A hikers' hostel needs to be the clean end-point of a long day on the trails. We’ve redesigned the access routes to our hostel with this in mind, and now we need the funds to build it.Plumbing: After a day out on the trails, there’s nothing you’re looking more forward to than a hot shower – and nothing worse than it running cold when someone turns on the tap in the kitchen! We'll be redesigning the building's plumbing to make sure this doesn't happen, and that everyone has hot and cold water when and where they need it.Electrical Installation: Old buildings in Armenia have often been wired... well, questionably. At the same time, today's travelers often pack a huge array of power-hungry devices. So we'll be outfitting the building with a brand new electrical system – critical for safety, and with the convenience of our guests a top priority.Large Appliances: Especially on a multi-day hike, laundry is a critical service for any hiker stopping over in a town like Dilijan. We'll be procuring a new and efficient washing machine that's up to this arduous task, along with a separate drying machine for rainy days (and there are plenty of those in Dilijan!).Air Conditioning & Ventilation: As well as being essential for comfort in the summer months, good ventilation is critical for hygiene in any communal living space.Business Operations: There's also plenty to do behind-the-scenes, including creating a booking system, website development, advertising, overhead costs, and salaries for our local staff. The complete guest experience is vital to the success of this venture, and we want to make it smooth and effortless.Emergency Funds: This is a big project with lots of variables, and that means having a contingency fund for when things don't quite go to plan. We've built a buffer into our budget so we're confident in being able to weather any sudden storms during our critical first year of operations.Perks for DonorsDilijan Hikers Hostel thanks you ahead of time for the contributions you make. Despite the limitations of this past year, we are expecting a high number of local tourists and want to ensure they have a clean and comfortable place to seek shelter in. Our commitment to serving our local community will be the foundation for this ever-growing project and we invite you to be a part of our journey! Pre-Book Your Stay: Summer is around the corner and soon we'll be rushing outdoors and planning some fun trips. Here's your chance to book your stay at Dilijan Hikers Hostel ahead of time and have a guaranteed spot available for you when you arrive in Dilijan. Whether you're pre-booking one night or more, alone or with friends, this is a great opportunity to plan ahead, receive lots of add-ons and a special thank you from us. Sponsoring the Local Community: A core objective for creating Dilijan Hikers Hostel is giving back to the trail network that brings us our guests! We invite you to help us by sponsoring trail clean-up days, trail-building events, and inviting local hikers to join us in exploring Dilijan National Park. Your efforts won't go unnoticed and you can expect to receive a special thank you from us and everyone who benefitted from your donation.Merchandise: In addition to handwritten thank-you cards, We'll also be rewarding our donors with beautifully crafted maps of Dilijan National Park. Check them out here: https://cartisan.org/product/dilijan-national-p....There's other TCT and Dilijan National Park merchandise available too – something, we hope, for everyone.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

story began a few years back, when I worked in one of Aberdeen’s coffee chains.

people love good tea, and the glaringly obvious lack of it in Aberdeen. It was
at that point that I committed myself to fill that gap in the market and give
the people what they really want. <b>Move over coffee your time is over! </b></p>And so the dream of running my own tea boutique,

</div><div> </div><p>       My daughter, who was a senior at a university in New
England, wanted to write a paper her senior year and asked me what the difference was growing up in Haiti vs the United
States.  I responded by asking her how old she was when she witnessed her
first homicide. She really didn't understand my response and asked if I
was joking with her. I said that I was not!  I told her that
I had witnessed two homicides by the time I was 6 year old. <b>Two young
boys, no older than 15 years old, were brutally attacked and beaten to death
because they had stolen a loaf of bread from a local merchant.</b> A
steep price to pay for a meal.  And one does not easily forget events
like this.   </p><p><b>                                               What would you do?</b></p><p>         I have four children and my youngest son is the same age as those two young boys that were killed. He has all the privileges that come with living in a nice community: great schools, access to extra-curricular activities, but also food on the table every night and a roof over his head.    What if
the roles were reversed? What if my son did not have those opportunities? What if my son and our family had little access to
food  and were constantly hungry? Would he be forced to do the same
thing that those two boys did when they lost their lives? <b>I believe that the
answer is YES!</b>  <b>This is what drives me to make this happen!  This is
the life of street kids living in the Dominican Republic.</b>  </p><p><b>                                                   Tough Streets</b></p><div>
</div><p>
</p><div>
</div><p>           Imagine a place where circumstances and conditions are so poor that one meal
a day feels like abundance. Imagine a place where a child dying is a normal
everyday occurrence. A place where kids have to defend themselves and cannot
clothe, educate or even feed themselves at times. Now the place we just had you
imagine.. It exists. The place we are speaking of in the life of a street kid in the Dominican Republic.</p><p>           <b>  We are hoping that with your help we can give them hope
thru your gifts, even momentarily. </b>  When a street kid gets a present it
lets them know someone cares about them and that can be life changing. 
One present, one meal, one touch from humanity.  It's that simple!! Let's put a smile on their eager faces around the holidays! </p><div>

Long before this campaign began,  I have been running a non-profit for the past 11 years and have been
doing charity work in Haiti and the Dominican Republic on a small scale. Every mission that I
have done leaves me with an empty feeling knowing that the need is so great. How can I help reach more people? One of my limitations is that I have

<p>“The majority (of street kids) come from
families where their most basic needs are not covered,” the Stateless in the DR
report states.  Some children turn to the
streets to help support their families, returning home at night. Others never
go back.  One Sixteen-year-old named Manuel
Antonio Santos has lived on the streets since he was 7. He occasionally visits
his family in Los Guandules, a neighborhood that he describes as an “aggressive
place.”  As you can clearly see this is
not a life, but the miracle is all of these kids are craving the tools,
knowledge and resources to become better and find help for themselves and their
families.  <b>So I appeal to you to help
them around the holidays and show them that someone cares.</b> They have an immense

                                       What is Christmas for all? 
       Christmas for all is a community service event that started in 2013 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. This event was started to bring awareness to the hardships of the street children living in the Capital and surrounding communities, with a focus around the Christmas holidays. My U.S based non-profit, haitianrelieforganization.org, and a local Dominican non-profit, fundacionads.org, and community volunteers coordinated to provide a Christmas meal, a Christmas gift, and entertainment for the children living on the streets.                                            The events set for this year                                                                      My Story
        My daughter, who was a senior at a university in New
England, wanted to write a paper her senior year and asked me what the difference was growing up in Haiti vs the United
States.  I responded by asking her how old she was when she witnessed her
first homicide. She really didn't understand my response and asked if I
was joking with her. I said that I was not!  I told her that
I had witnessed two homicides by the time I was 6 year old. Two young
boys, no older than 15 years old, were brutally attacked and beaten to death
because they had stolen a loaf of bread from a local merchant. A
steep price to pay for a meal.  And one does not easily forget events
like this.                                                  What would you do?         I have four children and my youngest son is the same age as those two young boys that were killed. He has all the privileges that come with living in a nice community: great schools, access to extra-curricular activities, but also food on the table every night and a roof over his head.    What if
the roles were reversed? What if my son did not have those opportunities? What if my son and our family had little access to
food  and were constantly hungry? Would he be forced to do the same
thing that those two boys did when they lost their lives? I believe that the
answer is YES!  This is what drives me to make this happen!  This is
the life of street kids living in the Dominican Republic.                                                     Tough Streets


           Imagine a place where circumstances and conditions are so poor that one meal
a day feels like abundance. Imagine a place where a child dying is a normal
everyday occurrence. A place where kids have to defend themselves and cannot
clothe, educate or even feed themselves at times. Now the place we just had you
imagine.. It exists. The place we are speaking of in the life of a street kid in the Dominican Republic.             We are hoping that with your help we can give them hope
thru your gifts, even momentarily.   When a street kid gets a present it
lets them know someone cares about them and that can be life changing. 
One present, one meal, one touch from humanity.  It's that simple!! Let's put a smile on their eager faces around the holidays! 
                                    
                                                 Our first event
     The first event took place on Dec 19th
2013 in a small park known for its aggressiveness and homelessness in Santo Domingo.
We purchased all the ingredients to prepare a gourmet meal for the kids. Our volunteers prepared the food at their homes and it was
delivered to our event site. We also purchased drinks and all the necessary
supplies needed to dress the tables in the park.  Once set up, we invited all of the Dominicans,
Haitians and Dominican/Haitians living on the streets to enjoy a meal. It was
an event that attracted over 30 kids. Most of them who attended were living in
the park in the immediate area.



                                                       Second Event
     The second event took place on
December 20th 2014. This happened in Plaza Guibia, which is also
located in Santo Domingo downtown on the Malencon. Because of exposure and word
of mouth, this event grew to over 120 and needed a lot more staffing and
expense. A local church and dance troupe volunteered to serve and put on a
dance routine to entertain the children.



On the 27th of December, we drove 150 toys two hours west of the capital to a small isolated community in the Province of Azua and held a  Christmas gifts sharing ceremony with 150 of the towns children.  We called this event:"" A gift for a smile.""
 
                 
                                                          This Year
     This year we are preparing to re-double
our efforts for a much larger event!  We have already started making arrangements to be in three separate parts  of the Country. On Dec. 19, we will be in downtown Santo Domingo serving close to 300 meals in Plaza Guibia on the Malencone. On Dec. 20th, my partner foundation and I will drive two hours north east to a small agricultural town in Hato Mayor, called Capote, and  will have a Christmas gift giving ceremony complete with Santa and distribute 150 toys to the local children.  On Dec. 27, we are driving two and a half hours west of the Capital to another isolated small town in the province of Azua and repeat the gift giving ceremony.   We are anticipating to purchase over 250 gifts and serve over 300 for this event. 
This will be impossible for me to do alone!! That's why I'm reaching out to like minded people to help me reach my goal!!  
                                              A little about us

I was Born in Haiti and have been a resident of Connecticut for the past 25 years. I have owned and operated many restaurants in the past thirty years and now find myself on a different journey.

                                            What We Need & What You GetWe are seeking  to raise $6,000 U.S to fund these events in December. The money will go towards buying 300 Christmas gifts, enough food for 300, utensils, drinks,  renting tables, chairs, sound system, paying for security and transportation for nineteen volunteers from the different locations and events.

                                     The Impact

Many people are blessed enough to live the
nice lives they deserve but sometimes we forget the conditions that others are
having to endure.  Here are some sobering
facts about the street kids:

More than a quarter – 27.6
percent – of families lives in poverty in Santo Domingo, according to
government statistics.
The Dominican National
Council for Children and Adolescents runs 58 centers and provides assistance to
18,800 children nationwide.
More than 13 percent of all
Dominican children ages 10 to14 works to help support their families, according
to a 2006 government report.
All of the children served
by the Niños Del Camino shelter in Santa Domingo come from impoverished
families and 77 percent have experienced domestic violence, according to 2009
data from the shelter.
The Niños Del Camino
shelter helped many street kids in 2009. Of those, 60% were Dominicans, 30% were
Haitians and the rest were Dominican-Haitians. Forty percent of them had been in
the streets for four to 10 years, according to the 2009 Niños Del Camino annual
report.

live in poor and unhealthy non sanitized conditions during summer
2014 war on Gaza                             "" Dr.jihad during a night shift at the Hospital ""                  "" Dr.Jihad at the Operation Room During the Last war on Gaza "" 
 The  M.P.C.  aims to :➢ Reach All unreached children
➢
Provide Medical Aid➢
Give consultations and Awareness Campaigns➢
Provide sanitary facilities➢
Applying Screening for common diseases and proper long term
management➢
Insure healthy Dietary and Educational and health AccessAfter three Gaza WarsThree Gaza wars (Dec2008,
Nov2012, Jul2014) Brought Gaza life to hell, buildings down, no
infrastructure, no clean water, no enough medical and health services.
The 8 yrs siege on Gaza and the unsupported government make about 400
hundred medical doctors unemployed even the governmental
hospitals need more far than this number .According to PCHR
Statistics about the 50-day war 2014, 2191 Palestinians were killed
and more than 527 of them were children, about 3306 children were
wounded and had temporary or permanent disabilities.
According to the United Nations Relief and Work Agency (UNRWA), more than
300,000 Gazans had been sheltering in its schools on August19th 2014,
and up to 500,000 people have been displaced by the conflict.
The UN estimates that more than 20,000 homes have been reduced to rubble
or rendered uninhabitable and workers are racing to
avert humanitarian crisis by fixing damaged water mains and power
lines .Out reach medical Services
The
Out Reach medical services became necessary in Gaza to cover wide range of
 children of borderlines areas, children  without  shelters, uninsured children  and children  with low socioeconomic backgrounds and to
cover another group of low educated careless group.

Common Children Health problems In Gaza Strip most
preschool and school age children complain of :
●
Anemia and dietary efficiencies
●
Infectious Diseases
●
Hereditary Problems
●
Mental health and psychiatric problems
Anemia Among Gazan Children
A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and September
2012. A total of 357 preschool children were selected using multistage sampling
method from Jabalya refugee camp, El Remal urban area, and Al Qarara rural
area. Anthropometric indicators for children were measured using the WHO
guideline. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine
the prevalence  and associated factors of
anemia.
The overall prevalence of anemia was 59.7% among preschool children in the
Gaza Strip, 46.5% and 13.5% of which are mild and moderate, respectively.
Boys were more susceptible to this deficiency than girls. Hemoglobin level
decreased in children living in poor households. Underweight children were
more susceptible to anemia than normal weight children
Infectious Diseases
Of most common are gastrointestinal parasites
among pre-school children in Gaza.
 A study of 679 stool specimens were collected
from pre-school
children aged <10 months to 60 months
attending Ard El-Insan Association
(Community
primary health care center) in Gaza city. Stool specimens were
inspected
by a direct smear microscopy and sedimentation techniques. The
study found
that 16.6% of the studied children were infected with intestinal
parasites.
Infection with Giardia lamblia showed the highest prevalence
(10.3%)
among other parasites detected. Intestinal parasite prevalence was
higher
among male children than females. All age groups were susceptible

for
parasitic infection and no clear trend due to age.
Possible causes that infections are common :● Overcrowded shelters and houses● Water pollution● Bad sanitary measuresOther common infections in Gazan Kids :● Upper respiratory infections, Otitis Media● All types of Gastroenteritis● Meningitis
Hereditary Problems :Hereditary and congenital problems are of the highest rates
among the world here in Gaza, this mainly because of :
● Traditions of relatives marriage
● Early marriage (sometimes children marriage)
● Chemical effects of war weapons
● Lack of genetic consultation and advisory campaigns.



Why
Children ?The
Out Reach medical services could serve every one, but more than 65%
percent of Gazan population are younger than 15 yrs (2009), this
implies that children compose the whole society and its future, thus
serving children is the most necessary and required.

Having helped launch restaurants, worked on their PR development, devised marketing and social media strategies, been a food critic, and most importantly, performed an excessive amount of edible research, I plan on taking my diverse background in the food industry and passion for hospitality to open and run Rosegold. This will be the first in my international empire of restaurants, each bespoke in their concept, with a focus on fantastic food and impeccable hospitality.    









What We Need: £100,000
Although this is only a portion of what I'll need for a project as great as this, you will be helping me maintain a stake in the business by covering some crucial start-up costs. Essentially - you're helping me buy parts of the restaurant! Let me break it down for you:Video - this awesome thing you've just watched: £1,200            Website & Branding: £6,000PR & Marketing: £9,000Legal Fees: £10,000Permits & Licenses: £4,000Insurance: £5,000Restaurant EPOS System: £1,200Ordering and Payment Machines: £600Glassware, Crockery & Cutlery: £15,000Menus & Printed Materials: £2,000 Linens, Napkins & Uniforms: £700Tables & Chairs: £17,500Combi Ovens & Ranges: £6,000Coffee Machine: £1,500 Sous Vide Machine: £300Convection Ovens: £360Kitchen Aid: £450Frying Unit: £230Sinks: £1,160Pots & Pans: £2,000Walk-In Refrigerator: £5,500Commercial Freezer: £1,000Gas Oven & Grill: £3,000Ice Cream Maker: £300Dishwashers: £2,000 Tools & Utensils: £3,000Stainless Steel Kitchen Hood Extraction: £1,000
 
What You Get:Since you're helping with some essential start-up costs and buying pieces of the restaurant - we'd love to give you a piece of Rosegold in return, and are offering some incredible experiences. From Rosegold gear you can wear to represent the brand - to VIP Rosegold Cards - to customised dinner parties, you better get in quick with some of these awesome perks before the campaign closes! Please note that no alcohol is included in any of the offerings - sorry, their rule, not mine. Also, please feel free to donate above the denoted value! :)     Risks & Challenges The endless advice, warnings and words from friends, family, restaurateurs, chefs and advisors have all cautioned me to the extreme risk involved in the restaurant industry. But, my career and success as a restaurateur is not an ""IF"", but a ""WHEN"". The only way to absolutely ensure failure, is to never have tried in the first place! When opening a restaurant, you must successfully address your target market, cast a wide net with marketing and PR, develop a happy customer base, train and grow your team to work towards achieving the same goal, and constantly adapt to change and circumstance. I want Rosegold to be a stable addition to the food scene, not a short-lived hotspot to ride out a temporary trend wave. I have built a network of professionals, advisors and industry-based contacts to both consult with and advise against stumbling at any obvious hurdles. Besides that, my insurmountable passion will help me overcome any glance at failure, as I will only ever learn from experiences of what to avoid at my next attempt.

You never know who would be willing to contribute, and they'll receive some great perks in return. Thank you - and I can't wait to welcome you to Rosegold!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>“Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.</b></h2><h2 style=""text-align: right;""><b> (Dalai Lama)</b></h2><p>We
all have dreams and we want to make decisions that can bring us towards our
dreams.</p>
<p>We
all know how difficult decision-making can be. Some decision can lead to unforeseen
results. There are techniques that can help us to make better decisions. We
want to help everyone reach their goals and dreams.</p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">Don’t be afraid to dream big</b></h2>
<h4><br/></h4><h3>Our dream</h3>
<p>Our
dream is that we can bring more happiness and freedom into life.</p>
<p>Our
passion is to help people raise the right questions and find the best answers
possible. We want to help everyone to progress in their own ways.</p>
<p>We
want to develop an innovative software that has the potential to change the
life of billions of people.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>During
our work we see that big companies <span>are using extremely expensive software for strategy building and
decision making. We realized that small businesses and individuals cannot
afford such software. So we thought it would be a great idea to create a software that is available to
everyone.</span></p>
<p>Most
of the small businesses and individuals have no “officially” planned strategy,
and they don’t really know how to develop a personal strategy.</p>
<p>So
we have two main mission types to accomplish:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Develop a software
where users can create their own strategy </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We have to teach
users how to use the different methods to get the most of that strategy</p>
<p>A
good strategy for our life is inevitable. It can highlight what we want in our
life.</p>
<p>Using
different methods of the software, you will see more and more ways you can find
it possible to implement it in your life.</p>
<p>By
translating your strategy into well-defined goals and actions, and validating those
goal definitions things will become clear.</p>
<p>Our
application also aims to support you when you receive some bad feedback or lack
of success. We help you to analyse the situation and find the cause and the
solution as well.</p>
<p>We
believe that by using the application you can discover more and more
opportunities in your life and you will feel freer than ever before.</p><p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">
<b>People should passionately think <br/></b><b>about their own life</b>
</h2>

<p>·<span> 
</span>Personal Advanced</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Small Business</p>
<h4>Personal Essentials</h4>
<p>
</p><p>It
consists of the most important parts that are necessary to develop and manage
your own strategy.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448669600/ipou0ppcepmz24bcityf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><h4>Small Business</h4>

</div>
<h4><br/></h4><h3>Main characteristics of the
application</h3>
<h4>Modular</h4>
<p>The
application consists of modules. These modules are capable to work without any
other modules. It makes them more independent and allows you use only those
parts of the application you really need.</p>
<h4>Integrated</h4>
<p>The
modules can work together, they share their data and the results. This way
modules can use or reuse the data you entered. Integration makes modules more
powerful as you can see the same things from varying perspectives.</p>
<p>The
wizard of the application and some modules like the Daily sum-up makes the
integration invisible for you.</p>
<h4>Flexible</h4>
<p>There
are many ways you can use the application, there are no strict rules. You
create your own personal universe that you find the most useful. You can record,
access, and utilize this information easily and efficiently.</p>
<h4>Customizable</h4>
<p>You
can customize the app in several ways.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>You can change
parameters and the look of the analyses</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>You can also add
your own views and analyses to the app</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>You can make changes
in menu fit your use.</p>
<h4>Expandable</h4>
<p>The
architecture of the software lets the developers integrate more and more
methods into the application.</p>
<h4>User friendly</h4>
<p>We
all know that analysing things are never an easy task. This app is simplified
in a way to enable everybody to access it without any previous experience. The
ultimate aim is that you only focus on the content and the app will do the
rest. The built in consultant helps you to see the conclusions.</p>
<h4>Continuous improvement</h4>
<p>We
will analyse the feedback from users and their usage patterns. We will build
into the app the results of these evaluations. With this continuous process
users will always find new improvements.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>Favourite function</h3>
<p>The
most exciting part of the application is the Daily sum up.</p>
<p>This
is the center where you can enter many things about what happened to you. For
example if you met someone, if you had a good idea, someone told you something,
if you had a new task, or a new project to do, or you discovered a new
opportunity. This function helps you to remember and record everything. What
you record automatically appears and modifies other analyses as all modules are
integrated.</p>
<p>We
believe that by using Daily sum up for only 15 minutes each day you can make it
work.</p><p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>We should dedicate more time to think about our own way.</b></h2><p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3>How to start</h3>
<p>We
recommend that you should start <span>using it step by step. Just take e.g. the Who am I function and
please take your time completing this section.</span></p>
<p>Each
day write down what you find about yourself. Then take the second step and so
on.</p>
<p>You
don’t need to rush. Just take your time to discover everything in your life.</p>
<p>Once
you have built up the base you can start to think about your way.</p>
<p>Never
stop managing your data. Everyday is a new adventure. New ideas, new
opportunities, new challenges, new achievements. Just keep your eyes open and
put them into your thinking.</p><p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>As you change, </b></h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>the world changes as well.</b></h2><p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3>Custom analyses </h3>
<p>MyWay
helps you to design you own custom analyses.</p>
<p>When
you find a need to keep track, group and analyse things in a new way, it is
easy to set up and integrate it with the existing analysing methods.</p>
<h3>Platforms</h3>
<p>Since MyWay can be useful for
everybody we plan to make it available for three major platforms: </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Android</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>IOS</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Windows Mobile</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Community thinking</h3>
<p>We believe in the inherent
creativity of people. Anytime a question was open to the public brilliant
answers turned up.</p>
<p>We plan to publish important questions
from time to time. These questions aim to make our world a peaceful and happy
place. We want to ask our users to share their answers with everybody. We will
summarize the received answers and publish the best ones .</p>

<h3>The price of the application</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We believe
that the advantages that this software can give you cannot be compared to its
price.</p>
<p>If you make
just one better decision in your life that would bring a much bigger benefit
for you than the cost of the software for many years.</p>
<p>Choosing
the right job, handling a conflict wiser, or managing better your tasks are
only examples of what advantages you may get.</p>

“Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions. (Dalai Lama)We
all have dreams and we want to make decisions that can bring us towards our
dreams.
We
all know how difficult decision-making can be. Some decision can lead to unforeseen
results. There are techniques that can help us to make better decisions. We
want to help everyone reach their goals and dreams.
Don’t be afraid to dream big
Our dream
Our
dream is that we can bring more happiness and freedom into life.
Our
passion is to help people raise the right questions and find the best answers
possible. We want to help everyone to progress in their own ways.
We
want to develop an innovative software that has the potential to change the
life of billions of people.
Background
During
our work we see that big companies are using extremely expensive software for strategy building and
decision making. We realized that small businesses and individuals cannot
afford such software. So we thought it would be a great idea to create a software that is available to
everyone.
Most
of the small businesses and individuals have no “officially” planned strategy,
and they don’t really know how to develop a personal strategy.
So
we have two main mission types to accomplish:
· 
Develop a software
where users can create their own strategy 
· 
We have to teach
users how to use the different methods to get the most of that strategy
A
good strategy for our life is inevitable. It can highlight what we want in our
life.
Using
different methods of the software, you will see more and more ways you can find
it possible to implement it in your life.
By
translating your strategy into well-defined goals and actions, and validating those
goal definitions things will become clear.
Our
application also aims to support you when you receive some bad feedback or lack
of success. We help you to analyse the situation and find the cause and the
solution as well.
We
believe that by using the application you can discover more and more
opportunities in your life and you will feel freer than ever before.

People should passionately think about their own life


Team
The MyWay team consists of persons who are working in different fields. The inventor of this application is an IT consultant who is a university guest professor teaching Company Strategies. There are friends, university students and teachers from various fields who made serious contributions to this concept.


What We Need & What You Get

We need about $200,000 to pay for the cost of everything that's needed to finance the development and the operation of the application. 
The donations you give us will be used to fund the design, programming, testing and operation of the software.In return, you will get a unique software that will help you in several ways in your life. Best life management methods collected and integrated in your hand. With your generous help, we'll be able to make this software as high quality as possible.
We are a few professionals and students and without you, we cannot make it. Every donation matters to us, as this campaign determines whether or not we can come this unique software true.
Without your contributions, we cannot afford to pay the developers, testers software designers, running costs and operational costs that are needed for a complex development like this.



Other ways you can help

You can help us by letting your friends know about this project. If you also believe that this software is for a good cause please use the sharing buttons on the left side of the page.
If you have any comment or question about our project please let us know. Your feedback is a great help for us. This way we know what additional information we should give for backers on our site.


Application versions

There
are 3 different packages will be available for the users:
· 
Personal Essentials
·

Personal Essentials

It
consists of the most important parts that are necessary to develop and manage
your own strategy.Small Business

version enables small entrepreneurs to complete a classic analyses that is
necessary for them to identify their opportunities, long term goals and to
build up their own action plans that brings them towards those goals.
Beyond
the classic analyses this version has other methods that are helpful for these
companies in different situations.
This
version also contains all modules of the Personal Essentials package with some
modification.Personal Advanced

that are adopted form the Small Business version. With these additional
features you can analyse your own personal environment and yourself from more
perspective. It helps you to find the way that really works for you.


Turn your dreams into goals
Turn your goals into actions

Main characteristics of the
application
Modular
The
application consists of modules. These modules are capable to work without any
other modules. It makes them more independent and allows you use only those
parts of the application you really need.
Integrated
The
modules can work together, they share their data and the results. This way
modules can use or reuse the data you entered. Integration makes modules more
powerful as you can see the same things from varying perspectives.
The
wizard of the application and some modules like the Daily sum-up makes the
integration invisible for you.
Flexible
There
are many ways you can use the application, there are no strict rules. You
create your own personal universe that you find the most useful. You can record,
access, and utilize this information easily and efficiently.
Customizable
You
can customize the app in several ways.
· 
You can change
parameters and the look of the analyses
· 
You can also add
your own views and analyses to the app
· 
You can make changes
in menu fit your use.
Expandable
The
architecture of the software lets the developers integrate more and more
methods into the application.
User friendly
We
all know that analysing things are never an easy task. This app is simplified
in a way to enable everybody to access it without any previous experience. The
ultimate aim is that you only focus on the content and the app will do the
rest. The built in consultant helps you to see the conclusions.
Continuous improvement
We
will analyse the feedback from users and their usage patterns. We will build
into the app the results of these evaluations. With this continuous process
users will always find new improvements.
Favourite function
The
most exciting part of the application is the Daily sum up.
This
is the center where you can enter many things about what happened to you. For
example if you met someone, if you had a good idea, someone told you something,
if you had a new task, or a new project to do, or you discovered a new
opportunity. This function helps you to remember and record everything. What
you record automatically appears and modifies other analyses as all modules are
integrated.
We
believe that by using Daily sum up for only 15 minutes each day you can make it
work.
We should dedicate more time to think about our own way.
How to start
We
recommend that you should start using it step by step. Just take e.g. the Who am I function and
please take your time completing this section.
Each
day write down what you find about yourself. Then take the second step and so
on.
You
don’t need to rush. Just take your time to discover everything in your life.
Once
you have built up the base you can start to think about your way.
Never
stop managing your data. Everyday is a new adventure. New ideas, new
opportunities, new challenges, new achievements. Just keep your eyes open and
put them into your thinking.
As you change, the world changes as well.
Custom analyses 
MyWay
helps you to design you own custom analyses.
When
you find a need to keep track, group and analyse things in a new way, it is
easy to set up and integrate it with the existing analysing methods.
Platforms
Since MyWay can be useful for
everybody we plan to make it available for three major platforms: 
· 
Android
· 
IOS
· 
Windows Mobile


Community thinking
We believe in the inherent
creativity of people. Anytime a question was open to the public brilliant
answers turned up.
We plan to publish important questions
from time to time. These questions aim to make our world a peaceful and happy
place. We want to ask our users to share their answers with everybody. We will
summarize the received answers and publish the best ones .

Project Roadmap


The price of the application

We believe
that the advantages that this software can give you cannot be compared to its
price.
If you make
just one better decision in your life that would bring a much bigger benefit
for you than the cost of the software for many years.
Choosing
the right job, handling a conflict wiser, or managing better your tasks are
only examples of what advantages you may get.

Planned
yearly subscription prices:
Personal
Essentials version: 48 USD (means only 4 USD/month)
Personal
Advanced version 72 USD (means only 6 USD/month)
Small
Business version 120 USD (means only 10 USD/month)

The Impact
We believe that the only way we can build a better future is to come together around our common purpose and common values. Around our desire to create a better world for our children. Around our desire to create a safer world where we are able to pursue our chosen interests, professions and occupations. To see each other as a sister or brother and not “the other”.

Risks & Challenges
Given our experience leveraging social media to engage with people around the world, the risks we face are simply organizational ones which we can overcome easily. Can we hire the right people? Can we overcome the doubt of others? Can we connect with local partners to make it more meaningful? Thankfully we already have many of the right people, we are experienced storytellers and we already have a global network of nonprofit, government and business leaders.We will solve any organizational challenge we face by constantly improving our systems and people.

The younger, was entering 12th grade and the older one entering his sophomore year in college. They, like many young men, wanted to sleep late, eat like horses, play ball and stay up late at night. I decided this would not happen, at least not unrestrained. I had the father son talk with them. I told them their behavior was changing as of that day.

After reading we each would discuss with the others what we read and I would comment, question and counsel them as necessary.  This would be their routine every day for the rest of the summer.Needless to say, they didn't like it at first. I made sure they read books on goals, self-development, finances, and history. The discussions served a two-fold purpose, one educational, and the second was a means of holding them accountable to ensure they actually read the books.  Following each week of reading and discussions, they were required to make five-minute presentations usually in a church service to help develop their communications and public speaking skills. This also gave them the chance to reinforce what they learned, engage with a live audience and get direct feedback from a supportive group, usually in a church or public setting. After a few weeks, their attitudes significantly changed. They became totally excited and began setting goals for their future. The eldest began seeking and receiving opportunities to speak in public. Our discussions became more engaging.

I announced to others that we would begin a formal program for these young males. I made a couple of public and private announcements about my plans and a few adult males, expressed interest in volunteering their time to assist me in mentoring. A parent asked if his young son who has challenges communicating publicly could participate.  An aunt wants her three nephews involved. A couple of people expressed an interest in supporting the effort once we began the formal classes.Our Current Resources Are:Four male volunteer mentors and two verbal commitments for support. Other resources include a thirty years in ministry and self-development, access to the internet, computer skills, an email marketing platform, some communications equipment, temporary location and social media pages.I have committed five hours per week, two hours of which is allotted for the classroom, with the other time for administration, preparation and development, marketing and promotion. Volunteers will spend one to 2 hours per week or as schedules permit.Our Current Team Includes:Myself to supervise and direct the program, my wife as an admin assistant, three adult male mentors, (an owner of a general insurance agency, a stock broker with real estates sales experience and a commercial and residential home inspector. and finally one female videographer.First Year SuccessesOur success will build on the positive results already achieved, while consisting of more of the same with at least 25-30 youth participating in the program and double the number of mentors. To recruit other young men who positively influence their peers, engage in the community, improve their grades, confidence and public speaking and raise expectations for their own success. Lastly we will evaluate, refine and enhance the program and as we establish ongoing support.Long Term GoalsOur long-term goals include recruiting active and retired teachers, to assist in tutoring various subjects and specific skills identified to maximize their learning and development, and to help enhance the program with trained teachers. Invite and recruit businessmen who can share their experiences and knowledge with young men to keep an influx of ideas flowing, and to give other volunteers the opportunity to give back to the community by inspiring these youth.    We also want to inspire the young men to help encourage others to participate and upon their success to return to the program to become mentors.Funding Needs Our funding needs will allow us to file for a non-profit organization, establishing an office and eventually rent space,  to create marketing and promotional materials, purchase books, audios, To obtain digital equipment for producing training resources:  audios, DVD's short video projects. To create manuscripts, reports and booklets for distribution, postage and shipping costs, obtain supplies and materials, two computers, a membership website portal design and development. We also seek to fund transportation needs for short field trips to expose youth to community opportunities that will allow us to build and deepen relationships so these young men can have more time in different settings and experiences with male mentors.Crowdfunding enables people with a great business idea to ask the general public for the funding they need to set up or expand. The business sets a target for the money it wants to raise and explains how it will use the cash. People can then make pledges for small amounts of money in return for a reward if the target is reached.",0.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>The official term “Mudskipper Cafe” has only been in use since 2009, but our camp has been around much longer but with other names and was more like a camp that developed over time rather from one single plan or idea.</p>
<p>The Mudskipper Cafe grew out of a group of burners that used to be a part of the huge collective village know as “Avalon Village” in a camp known as UT or “Uncharted Territories”. Since Avalon disbanded as a village it was decided to change the name during the 2009 “Evolution” since this would be the first year in several that “Avalon” would not register together but rather as different camps. So like the Mudskipper taking it’s first step onto land from water, the Mudskipper cafe took it’s first step to being an entity in itself.</p>

The economy in NY raised our taxes, and ruined our incomes, the property that had been promised to me since I was five years old was sold for pennies on the dollar to make life a little easier on our family. Well I admittedly didn't take it well, I immediatly starting looking for some way to salvage what I was forced to give up so that my children could one day enjoy what I spent my whole childhood till I was 30 enjoying myself. The woods, nature, waterfront, we had to no heat, no A/C no hot water  no cable nothing but woods and water and it was paradise. So I thought to myself where could I find that again affordable, I literally had a budget of less than 100 dollars and a dream. So I scoured the ads, online and Craigslist and came upon a very promising 1968 one owner Apache Mesa pop up camper, and I made offers and deals and could not get it within budget, three months later I recieve an email from the owner saying he still had it and he was with ready to sell it or scrap it. Long story short,  a two hour drive and a fifty dollar bill later I was its proud second owner. Well, I thought so, let's just say I've had three years of experts laugh, restorers laugh and my wife occasionally mock my purchase as well. I had made a mistake, my fifty dollar camper was in need of upwards of 2000 dollars in repairs. A little heartbroken and a aware of where to go next I tucked it away in the back yard and moved on.

Beds, stoves, toilet, sink,  solar lighting and some source of heat and seating. The article that caught my eyes took this all one step further and added the recycling of a used pop up camper to make the foundation and make the whole microhouses mobile!</div>
<div>My idea takes it yet a small step forward from there, I have a background in furniture restoration and refinishing, I've also found myself walking into collapsing buildings upon owners requests and pulling out beautiful tongue and grove flooring, hundred year old planks, left to rot fixtures and hinges and bracers and beautiful doors as well. So I would like to combine it all and attempt not only up cycle my pop up into my first prototype mobile microhouse but I'd love to attempt to make it as much as possible out of reclaimed product.

</div></div>","Freedom Farm For Vets is a non-profit working farm with a main purpose of growing vegetables, offering animal interaction and providing a peaceful and purposeful place for veterans to go. 


The farm is open to all veterans and their families, giving them a positive place to be a part of and to visit.


Veterans are free to work in the gardens and take home vegetables to their families, interact with the animals or simply sit under the apple trees and observe farm life.



Vegetables grown on the farm are donated to a local food pantry and sold in the local community to raise funds to be used to help our veterans in any way possible.



You can learn about how the Balen family farm inspired our organization’s mission on our website Freedom Farm for Vets

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>“ </b>When I first heard about the HoneyComb Village concept, I was amazed. I never imagined that this type of well-thought through ""semi-permanent"" housing concept is possible! In India, we have huge problems when it comes to housing for the poor. This type of concept could be an answer to our current situation. This model will not only provide housing to the poor but can actually build industry, create jobs and provide a stepping stone for them to reach permanent place to live. What I like the most about HV concept is it's architecture and color coding system. It's unique and easy to understand for both the literates and the illiterates, which is extremely important. This kind of housing concept should not only be looked at during some kind of disaster, but should be looked at for turning the rural villages into smart cities. I think this is a very innovative concept and it may be the NEXT THING in housing sector! <b>”</b></i></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><b><u>Competition, risks,
and challenges</u></b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">        What other semi-permanent housing solutions are already available? From Pup-tent to mobile-homes when you need 1 liter of fresh water you have to walk and carry water back each time you run out. There are too few solutions that incorporate indoor plumbing, proper sanitary waste management, and sustainable utilities in an affordable solution. Most simply do not adequately provide necessary utility service.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">       Risks are inherent in manufacturing. We’ve taken precautions to prepare drawings, model known conditions, and document logistics from manufacturing through deployment. The risk is in the unknown conditions that will arise in the process. Our response to the rise will be to collaborate with our design, manufacturing, and distribution partners and overcome the challenges. We are dedicated to keep our backers updated on the HV website and inform them about issues and our efforts to resolve them as they arise.</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">       The challenge of designing Honeycomb Village was to integrate all the basic services within each pavilion and throughout the village. Making a sustainable infrastructure affordable is meeting the challenge. The price estimate will be confirmed and economies of scale will bring them down. The raised platform is a proven solution in high-tech industries around the world. Data centers, ChipFab's, and other process industries have developed and tested the functionality of access floor services. But, how will these ""high-tech"" services work in housing? Therein lies some risk. To residents these utility lines are invisible. The utility infrastructure will only be accessible to platform maintenance staff of Honeycomb Village.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Critics say we risk not providing 100% utilities sustainably. We use the 80/20 rule throughout Honeycomb Village (HV). Rain Harvesting, PV's and bio-digesting are goals, not sole ideals. Locations will have some resources available. When there's no rain in Ujjain, trucks can deliver water and plug into the central water line of HV to top-off our tanks. When the Photo-Voltaic (PV) micro-grids supply is outstripped by demand our network is connectable to a central utility or generators to re-charge our batteries. We call it being pragmatic. Save where you can, use when you must. This dovetails with our approach to form a Public-Private-Partnership with institutions to promote sustainable utilities and a manageable infrastructure. Good housing design is applied to all components of HV for maintainability, fire-resistance, safety, and accessibility.</p>

A society that abandons its responsibility to promote a safe and healthy infrastructure will carry the reproductive weight of human neglect.









“As a medical professional and medical technologist I see Honeycomb Village as a balanced environment for serving people’s needs. Integrating Tele-Clinics and Educational Forums into the network of housing shows foresight that is essential to successful urban plan designed to lift people beyond their situation in life. The design of the structure is such that it is easy to maintain the necessary hygiene and sanitation in these pavilions of the Honeycomb Village, making them an ideal place for Tele-Clinic services.” 
Dr. Pankaj Parashar- MBBS, PhD Indian Institute of Technology,
Delhi/ AIIMS New Delhi 

Who else can help
make this happen?
We are talking with
International Red Cross, USAID, and others who provide essential services for earthquake
and tsunami humanitarian relief. We’ve presented HV to construction and
agriculture interests who see decent housing with medical and school
pavilions for workers and their families. Event and resort interests see
on-site housing for visitor accommodations. An outdoor enthusiast saw HV as accommodations
in national parks with minimal impact on the natural surroundings. I’ve met few
people who don’t see some shared aspect in Honeycomb Village.


“Specifically, due to the position I have held for many years in connection with the Parthenon reconstruction I constantly receive visits and correspondence from individuals …who aspire to make a contribution to the work of the Parthenon. The volume of these requests is very high and given that the time that I can devote to them is limited I only concentrate on the ones that are most promising. Among those that I regard as the most serious proposals is the one submitted by American architect Mr. Scott B. Knox for the production of primary digital documentation of the Parthenon with actual on-location use of laser scanning techniques to produce a high-resolution three-dimensional computer model.”….” I wholeheartedly support Mr. Knox, not only because I know precisely what useful purpose it will serve but also because, following a careful study of his accompanying documents, I concluded that both he and his associates have the required technical knowhow and the proper professional attitude.”
Dr. Manolis Korres- Parthenon Head Architect,
Committee for the Conservation of the Acropolis Monuments, Athens, Greece.

Why Crowdfund Honeycomb Village?
The first “anything”
is more expensive than each of the thousands that may follow. Economies of
scale will drive down costs for each pavilion, but few people can self-fund a
project of this scale alone. This project’s goals are too large not only in the
monetary sense, but in the practical sense as well. I helped design and build
the nano-technology industry in New York and learned the power of Public
Private Partnerships. Nanotechnology hardly existed there a few decades ago. Now,
with the kick start it received from broad support the semiconductor industry is a multi-billion dollar engine for growth. Semi-permanent buildings are
more than an inexpensive housing design, they can be a new industry in
a country with a great need for safe and affordable housing. This
is where crowdfunding come in: we need your help to fill the gap. India
builds quality permanent housing, but for a LARGE percentage of her VERY LARGE
population the leap from no/low quality housing to that permanent house
is just too great. Once we crowdfund this project with help from many stakeholders, then Honeycomb Village will have an opportunity to build an
industry, create jobs, and generate income. The result may provide a stepping-stone, a transitional point, for people at the lowest rungs to reach a permanent
housing and be the true gift of your donation. Imagine, you can help make ALL
housing more affordable, build a new industry from the ground up, and plant
seeds to grow a middle-class! Sound like a grand challenge? It is, but we can’t
do it without your help.

Honeycomb Village- a sustainable and modular solution.



“ When I first heard about the HoneyComb Village concept, I was amazed. I never imagined that this type of well-thought through ""semi-permanent"" housing concept is possible! In India, we have huge problems when it comes to housing for the poor. This type of concept could be an answer to our current situation. This model will not only provide housing to the poor but can actually build industry, create jobs and provide a stepping stone for them to reach permanent place to live. What I like the most about HV concept is it's architecture and color coding system. It's unique and easy to understand for both the literates and the illiterates, which is extremely important. This kind of housing concept should not only be looked at during some kind of disaster, but should be looked at for turning the rural villages into smart cities. I think this is a very innovative concept and it may be the NEXT THING in housing sector! ”

This phase is the first step to manufacturing 25,000 pavilions. Our goal is to eventually house 1M people in health and dignity. Let's IndiegoGO and begin Honeycomb Village. I have boot-strapped this project since it’s inception. We're engaging professional architects and engineers, government officials at State and local levels, national organizations like the Red Cross and Rotary, doctors, specialists in sustainable design from rain-water harvesting, solar photo-voltaic, and bio-digesting. We now greatly need your support to launch Honeycomb Village into production and seed a new economy for people and affordable housing in India and around the world.

“ Scott was often relentless to make cross-disciplinary connections as well as making cross-disciplinary critiques. His insights and questions were challenging both to me and to his student colleagues. In a fashion that is typical for him he labored assiduously to consider every facet of the design from urbanistic issues to political implications to details. Overall, Scott was one of the most mature, self-directed, and highly motivated students I have come in contact with in our graduate program. ”

“ I have known Scott Knox for over 25 years, and highly recommend him because I have seen his dedication to work and family. I know that because he has been working in and around building construction as both a tradesman and an architect, his balance of theoretical and practical experience helps him grasp a wide scale of projects. Scott’s comfortable communicating and expresses himself well in everyday circumstances and under pressure. I expect you would find him to be a great asset to your organization, and someone people truly enjoy working with.”

Competition, risks,
and challenges
        What other semi-permanent housing solutions are already available? From Pup-tent to mobile-homes when you need 1 liter of fresh water you have to walk and carry water back each time you run out. There are too few solutions that incorporate indoor plumbing, proper sanitary waste management, and sustainable utilities in an affordable solution. Most simply do not adequately provide necessary utility service.
       Risks are inherent in manufacturing. We’ve taken precautions to prepare drawings, model known conditions, and document logistics from manufacturing through deployment. The risk is in the unknown conditions that will arise in the process. Our response to the rise will be to collaborate with our design, manufacturing, and distribution partners and overcome the challenges. We are dedicated to keep our backers updated on the HV website and inform them about issues and our efforts to resolve them as they arise.
       The challenge of designing Honeycomb Village was to integrate all the basic services within each pavilion and throughout the village. Making a sustainable infrastructure affordable is meeting the challenge. The price estimate will be confirmed and economies of scale will bring them down. The raised platform is a proven solution in high-tech industries around the world. Data centers, ChipFab's, and other process industries have developed and tested the functionality of access floor services. But, how will these ""high-tech"" services work in housing? Therein lies some risk. To residents these utility lines are invisible. The utility infrastructure will only be accessible to platform maintenance staff of Honeycomb Village.
Critics say we risk not providing 100% utilities sustainably. We use the 80/20 rule throughout Honeycomb Village (HV). Rain Harvesting, PV's and bio-digesting are goals, not sole ideals. Locations will have some resources available. When there's no rain in Ujjain, trucks can deliver water and plug into the central water line of HV to top-off our tanks. When the Photo-Voltaic (PV) micro-grids supply is outstripped by demand our network is connectable to a central utility or generators to re-charge our batteries. We call it being pragmatic. Save where you can, use when you must. This dovetails with our approach to form a Public-Private-Partnership with institutions to promote sustainable utilities and a manageable infrastructure. Good housing design is applied to all components of HV for maintainability, fire-resistance, safety, and accessibility.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>Risks &amp; Challenges </h1> <p> </p>
<p>BISE is developed &amp; powered by 2 innovative SMEs: InnoGage and Pivot, with a valuable experience in open innovation and digital marketing/communication in various complementary domains (i.e. eGovernment, eParticipation, stakeholders’ engagement, social media, smart cities, mobile and telecommunication industry) of the Information and Communication society (ICT), making BISE a social entrepreneurship project by empowering people to meet and rate/exchange useful tips on hangouts across a city.</p>
<p>InnoGage and Pivot teams are multi-disciplinary and well balanced between men and women to offer a multi-gender vision to BISE.</p>
<p>InnoGage &amp; Pivot central objective is: to use their relevant expertise, experience and know-how in open innovation, mobile applications, social media, stakeholders’ engagement and in the markets of Europe and North America (targeted BISE markets) to develop, market and commercialise BISE in European and North American cities.</p>
<p><b>BISE solution:</b> BISE is a new mobile dating business model that transforms mobile and online dating markets by using and combining innovative technologies like more accurate geolocalisation and PoIs check-in as enablers to real-life encounters at the hangout users are in.</p>
<p>BISE current stage of development: InnoGage &amp; Pivot joined forces during Quarter 1 2015 to develop, market and commercialise BISE in Europe &amp; North America. </p>
<p><b>This partnership offers 2 essential key success factors:</b> Innovation &amp; Technical expertise, BISE markets knowledge &amp; foothold.</p>
<p><b>BISE key milestones until now: </b></p>
<p><b>MS0.1 (Quarter 1-2015):</b> Business idea &amp; Business models. </p>
<p><b>MS0.2 (Quarter 2-3-2015):</b> BISE technical specifications, costs and timeframe (145 days development time).</p>
<p><b>MS0.3 (Quarter 2-3-2015):</b> Field interviews with potential users (men, women) at different PoIs in Europe (i.e. pubs, afterworks, social events, friends get-togethers). Refinement of Business concept &amp; technical features.</p>
<p><b>MS0.4 (Quarter 2-2015):</b> Setting-up BISE team with complementary skills &amp; know-how, with a gender balance to develop a product and service that will fit both genders needs &amp; wants. Design of a temporary logo.</p>
<p><b>MS0.5 (Quarter 3-2015):</b>  Seeking funding sources (public &amp; private) as well as investors coaching.</p>
<p><b>BISE partnership is composed of 2 innovative SMEs, InnoGage and Pivot that are complementary with clearly defined roles in the set-up, development, implementation and commercialization of BISE. </b></p>
<p><b>The Envisioned BISE Solution: </b>Since the current online dating services can no longer keep up with the fast evolving needs of the users, BISE offers a highly south after mobile dating application, which bring additional benefits for the users and economical and cultural stakeholders compared to existing application by providing: (1) a customized pool of choice for the users by narrowing down the category of matchers according to the user’s preferences, i.e. by PoI such as restaurants, museums, market, festivals, bars, nightclub, etc.; (2) specific features for the users such as (a) profile differentiation: the option to upload 5 pictures instead of only one; (b) incorporating features form Facebook and other social networks; (c) match agenda keeper: splash screen when there is a match, plus “Make your move” or “Later” options to keep track of your matching steps; (d) new discovery settings: gender (M, F, other – additional feature for transsexuals); age range from 18; manual/auto check in; search the most popular PoIs following ratings from users; (e) visible at all times or hidden; (f) anonymous registration option; (g) Like justification feature, etc. (2) advertising opportunities for commerce &amp; cultural sectors (banks, telecom companies, stores, retailers, shopping centres, pubs, restaurants, nightclubs, museums, etc.).</p>
<p><b>BISE overall plan to reach market:</b> BISE pre-commercialisation phase (6 months), will enable BISE team to further enhance its overall plan to reach market with (1) an detailed business plan (2) develop BISE mobile app – version 1 (3) Set-up its key funding/marketing/promotional activities to ensure its foreseen 1st year marketing and promotional launch in its targeted markets (target 20% of overall markets) (4) build its critical mass users based community to ensure success.</p>
<p><b>IPR Management &amp; Regulatory Issues:</b> InnoGage owns the IPR. No patent protection is being sought at this time as the technology behind the combined unique product features along with the organic market build out will put the product at least 6 months ahead of competition. However, patent protection would be sought once we saw potential for competition. Regulatory concerns involve Privacy Rules within Europe. The InnoGage –Pivot collaboration will manage according to all Privacy rules and regulations, for example Article 8, of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which provides a right to respect for one's ""private and family life, his home and his correspondence"", subject to certain restrictions .

</h3>
<h3>I am an experienced IT professional (with MEng &amp; PhD from UK) based in London for the past 18 yrs. I noticed that people ordering take away from restaurants for their parties at home are often dis-satisfied with the quality, quantity and the price. Therefore, I want to launch a webportal for this specific need/gap in the market by involving and empowering women having passion for cooking. Initially, as a pilot, in London area (within M25) only for this purpose. <br/>
</h3>
<h3>The plan is to register interested ladies/homemakers who are passionate about cooking and want to take it up as their personal business as per their choice and available time on a fleximode. The diversity of this group will have expertise on different types of cuisine like Chinese, Continental, Indian etc. The otherside of the webportal will have the members or visitors wanting to order freshly cooked home made economical food. The value proposition is the price, quality, quantity and healthy yet tasty bites for small gatherings/parties or even daily consumption at home. People ordering food may need to arrange for their deliveries initially (pilot), till a proper delivery logistics partner is sorted out in the third version, as the portal will have another line of self-employment creation channel of engaging with logistics partners (something similar to UBER), in the same way. Thats why the portal will take the details of post-code for the order and try to find the nearest cook(s)/delivery driver(s) for the demand and match it up. <br/>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>IMPACT &amp; CONTRIBUTION TO THE SOCIETY AT LARGE:</h3>
<h3>It is important to me as I want to create another kind of self-employment and particularly to empower women who are homemakers and having the inclination to get into self employment &amp; financial independence. I know there is a lot of captive potential available in this market which can be easily on-boarded onto this platform. The first step towards launching this platform is to create an easy to use webportal taking into account all the relevant details and there after take the order and fulfillment thru a process based approach. Something similar to what ebay does, except that it does not take postcode details and matches up with the distance for delivery. Here its important as the orderer will have to take the delivery himself/herself from the seller, initially. The system also need to carry out some background checks (DBS checks &amp; food hygiene certifications) in order to protect interests of both customers and sellers. Also, it will have an interface with some payment gateway for financial transactions. Hence the webportal will be technical, safe, sophisticated and feature packed. <br/>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>WHY INVESTMENTS ARE NEEDED:<br/>
</h3>
<h3>This may need a good investment to design &amp; develop such a portal. Besdies this, the pilot launch will need good digital marketing campaigns on SEO, Social Networking sites and other digital media platforms, coupled with local newsletters advertisements. The entire thing will take some time to take off and get fully operational. Later, networking, word-of-mouth, sponsorships within local community festivals etc will also promote the usage of the webportal. We have a lot of friends and family circle based in different areas within M25 region of London and hence the first level of advertising etc will not be very difficult to get to the start. I am aware of people doing this kind of business on their own but it is currently being done within a limited circle and not open to the masses. On this platform anyone willing to provide such a service will have options to register, list menu, prices, special offers, and quote a price, based on the order menu and delivery date/time. The target customers will be not only party consumers but can also be those people who are sick &amp; tired of eating out everyday (students in universities, singles living alone with a busy job, busy couples &amp; families not able to afford eating out regularly, health conscious people and old age people not able to go out or afford restaurant food etc). <br/>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>QUANTUM OF FUNDING &amp; LIKELY SPEND AREAS: </h3>
<h3>The initial spend will be in development of the webportal, which is going to be the main business platform. This may need approx. 3 months time with a spend of £30-40K. This webportal will however go thru atleast 3 versions before it becomes fully stable. The pilot testing period will be atleast for 3 months for detecting issues and challenges faced and then addressing them. The other portion of funding will be used for hiring atleast 2-3 nos of technical admin people to run and manage the system. The initial few months will be critical as we plan to have tel based support as well. The entire development of the platform is going to be outsourced but under my close supervision on the design and functional features that are essential. At the moment the ballpark estimate to launch this operation is close to £80,000, for the first year. The plan is to make the investors as equity holders (with a min qualifying figure of £10K, to an equity range between 1% - 7.5%) in the business based on the size of investment they make. But its limited to only first 25 nos. Other investers will be on a reward mode (cash or perk) based on the yearly profit. The scheme is yet to be designed and developed. As the webportal membership/registration will be free, the main source of revenue will be from the percentage share of the charged amount of the orders fulfiled. Majority part of the payment from customers will go to the cooks/sellers. The other revenue will be from any advertisements, banners, corporate or SME support provided to the cause of this webportal. I have already so many interested parties (both corporate as well as individuals) keen in supporting this noble cause with a yearly financial contribution ranging from £2K to £10K. This business may take atleast 2-3 years to achieve recognition/popularity &amp; realize full business potential. Eventually I plan to make it a Global Portal connecting all the interested parties into one space. The first step towards this will be to launch it within M25 area of London, then to go to other metros of the UK and thereafter Pilot test another European region or North America followed by Canada &amp; Australia. If this plan does not succeed the funds invested may be sunk, as my own funds are also going to be involved. However, the objective will be to see that all the investors get ATLEAST their principal amount of investment returned in the first 2 years. This idea is creative as it will build self employment of women at home without disrupting their daily lives, with minimum hassles and yet do things that they enjoy. Also, that some of these which are done only by the women who are well connected in their circles will also be practiced by those who may not have a large social circle and less connected. <br/>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>RISKS &amp; LIKELY CHALLENGES: <br/>
</h3>
<h3>One of the major challenges is to design and develop such a comprehensive platform/webportal packed with all the features for capturing all the necessary data points and then fulfilling the order. The end2end process needs to be perfect. This may need good quality architecting, design, development, payment gateway and other technical aspects. Besides this the challenge will be to quickly launch it and make it visible on the web and attract relevant visitors. I have the necessary knowledge and background in IT to address this, but still the risk &amp; challenge will prevail. The down side is the time extension. Evenif most of the challenges are met, the time taken to address these challenges may be longer than anticipated. But, surely, I am confident to make this a success in a fairly moderate time-frame. The management leaders like Late Prof. CK Prahlad - one of the most beloved teachers at the University of Michigan, said that things that can be made for the masses or  targetted towards the grassroot population are the ones destined to succeed. This plan is also having such a noble objective and I genuinely feel it has a good potential to succeed. In order to reflect the economical part of the offering, I also have plans to show the like2like ""price comparison""..... if the same menu and quantity was ordered from a set of nearby restaurant(s) coupled with the feedback ratings of the food suppliers. This feature will develop the trust factor and client satisfaction rate will be lot higher. However, this plan can only be deployed after the base platform is built.<br/>

<p><b>EHC Group joins the fight

<p>The Peshmergahs, the Yezidis, the Iraqi Christian Resistance, as well

organization Islamic State (IS), with some means that are sometimes undersized,
an identified lack of training and international relays that are often
impaired.</p>
<p>In order to face the advance of the IS, EHC GROUP LLC, a French
speaking ESSD (Security and Defense services company, in French “<i>Entreprise de Services de Sécurité et de Défense</i>”),
created in 1999 and registered in the United States since 2004, has decided to
bring its support and its contribution to the fight against this plague.</p>
<p>With over fifteen years of experience in the areas of military
training, operational support, strategic, technical or logistical assistance
and security-safety services, EHC Group wishes to provide assistance to the
minorities that are fighting Islamic State’s troops.</p>
<p>It will initially be about to provide technical, logistical,
administrative and medical support to the different resistance movements. To do
so we will seek, create and maintain a local and international network which
will enable us to provide to these resistance movements some personnel who
would train the volunteers after having identified their weakest skills. They
will also be able to support the implementation of medical premises, to provide
an administrative support as well as managing and securing some refugees camps.</p>
<p>Furthermore, EHC Group proposes, upstream as well as downstream, to
unify and structure the various individual or collective initiatives departure
of the international volunteers. Upstream, EHC Group will not only identify the
best candidate able to provide the requested support but will also be in charge
of the security checks (mainly by checking the reliability of the CVs and the
mentioned qualifications). Downstream, EHC Group will monitor the
administrative procedures (especially the preparation of candidates’ files) and
will focus on leverage our local networks to secure the various stages of the
volunteers’ journey.</p>
<p>To run this project EHC Group will partner with a British consulting
firm: ATHENA DEFENCE Ltd. The synergy of these two entities will enable the
provision of a personal pool of French and English speaking people, highly
trained, deployable at very short-notice and able to deliver on the ground a
high quality assistance, running from a few days to several weeks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, aware of the obvious lack of communication in and from
the combat zones, EHC Group wishes to set up a monitoring unit that will manage
in real-time an international communication channel accessible worldwide.</p>

</div></div>","Youth Hostel Pinesta is a young, vibrant, funky, slightly crazy but extra homey hostel we're working on.

What We're All About Two months ago, Andreea & Sara came to Croatia to open a hostel. Lack of funds inspired us to build it out of old materials, unwanted furniture and with our own handiwork. 

We are building on local
resources and the concept of upcycling & do-it-yourself to create a beautiful temporary respite for travelers, a home lost in time and space. Imagine: hammocks to rest in under the sky full of stars, a common room in a tree house, pine cones and paper birds hanging from the walls, old tyre swings and candles in acorn jars.
All that's missing is a community, some love and a proper renovation.

(Current dorm rooms.)The Why's and How's
 
Pinesta is an old tourist resort for children and youth, built more than fifty years ago - at the height of socialist Yugoslavia. Although registered as a youth hostel for many years, the world's ideas of a hostel have left Pinesta behind.
We want to bring it back to the present. Situated in a pine forest with almost four hundred meters of beach, the site is perfect. But with old communist-style buildings, dilapidated furniture and no money for maintenance, we need a little bit of help from the outside.

(The property lies in a beautiful pine forest on the beach.)

The owner of the place has already signed a deal with us. It's already registered as a hostel. The next stage is to renovate it and thus our crowdfunding campaign. 

What You Get
We have two types of rewards: handcrafted gifts for you or your loved ones OR various packages to visit our hostel.
 

 
Handcrafted gifts are inspired by our place and work: dreamcatchers made of pine needles and cones, old bike tyres and sea shells that Andreea will make especially for you. Or move over to Sara's specialty, origami birds on a string made from colourful leftover paper and beer bottle caps.
   

What We Get

The funds raised from our campaign will go to:

installation of a common kitchen in the hostel ($3000)
renovation of the bathrooms ($4000)

heating and cooling systems in the hostel ($2000)
outdoor terrace ($1000)

equipment and extras: hammocks, duvets, second hand books and music instruments, furniture paints, faster internet connection (any surplus)

<p>(
Contract of Limited partnership )</p>
<p>This letter of agreement, also known as a contract
of limited partnership, is an agreement between the crowdfunder investor and
American Family Registry Service (American Family Registry Service  also herein known as AFRS).</p>
<p>This agreement grants the Investor a limited
partnership with American Family Registry Service (1) based on the amount of
investment and based (2) based on the amount of total investors and (3) based
on a time period set by American Family Registry Service of 1 year.  The 1 year time period starts on the day of
the public launch of the APP – APP#3.  1
year constitutes or equals 365 days.</p>
<p>All funds raised in this crowdfunding campaign will
go towards the development of a particular APP that at this time we will call
APP#3.  Currently, details of APP #3 are
proprietary as there is currently no other APP on the market like APP#3.</p>
<p>APP#3 is unique in that there is no other app
currently on the app markets like it. 
This APP will be downloaded for a standard fee and certain use of the
app will cost a fee for that particular aspect use of the app.  So in theory, the app will raise revenue in
three (3) ways (1) download revenue and (2) certain use revenue and (3) the
certain additional use aspect of the APP can produce revenue in of itself so
ultimately there will be three ways the APP will generate revenue.</p>
<p>The term limited partner between the investor (s) and
American Family Registry Service only refers to a partnership in the sharing of
the profits for a set amount and a set time period as stated above.  Limited Partnership in this case by contract
does not constitute any other vested interest in the business.  A Limited Partner will not possess management
or supervisory authority in any aspect of American Family Registry
Service.  Investors in this campaign will
only have the ability to profit from the APP which will be developed from this
campaign ( aka APP#3 ) for the purpose of this contract.</p>
<p>If there are multiple investors the profits shared
between American Family Registry Service and the Investors will be based on (1)
the amount invested and the amount of profits gained by the sales revenue of
the American Family Registry Service app for a set time period as stated above.</p>
<p><b>ONLY INVESTMENTS IN THE RANGE OF $1000- TO $50000-
WILL BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POSSIBLE PROFIT SHARE PROGRAM.  ALL LOWER CONTRIBUTION ARE CONSIDERED ANGEL

CONTRIBUTIONS.  THANK YOU.</b></p>
<p>IF- there is only one investor, and AFRS Profits permit,
and profits exceed the investors investment that single investor will, if
applicable, receive up to but not more than triple their investment (
investment X 3 ) profits permitting.</p>
<p>Example – If 1 person invests $20,000- dollars and
after 365 days has passed from the date of public launch of the app and AFRS
receives $160,000- gross profit but after expenses.  The single investor will receive the total
cost of the investment of $20,000-  plus
a portioned share  of profits of
$40,000-.  Therefore the total return to
the investor would be $60,000-.</p>
<p>If -2 or 3 or more – investors – contributed
investment amounts, their share(s) of profits at the end of one year(365 days)
will be determined (a) based on the amount they invested and up to but not more
than two times their initial investment. </p>
<p>Example – If Investor#1 invests $5000- and
Investor#2 invests $10,000- and Investor #3 invests $15,000- and after the
determined 1 year (365 days ) has expired and AFRS receives $160,000- ( after
expenses ) Investor#1 would receive their initial $5000- investment plus
$5000-  in profits.  Investor#2 would receive their initial
investment of $10,000- plus $10,000- in profits.  Investor#3 would receive their initial
investment of $15,000- plus $15,000- in profits.</p>
<p>Example – If the total AFRS gross profits ( after
expenses ) is $160,000- And total investments equals $100,000- the investors
will receive their investments of $100,000- and the remaining $60,000- will be
divided proportionally between the investors based on the amount of their
investment.  The larger the investment
the larger proportional profit the investor will receive. – Example – If 3
investors invest $5000- each and 1 investor invests $85,000- and total Profits
is $160,000- the investors investing $5000- each will receive their $5000- each
plus $3000- each in profits and the single investor who invested $85,000- will
receive their $85,000- investment plus $51,000- in profits. </p>
<p>The funds of this campaign will go into the
development of our APP creation ( APP#3) and towards initial marketing of the
APP.  The funds will not be used for
other company expenses such as income or travel expenses or entertainment
expenses.</p>
<p>Once the application has been created, perfected and
published from the time of going public with the APP or from the time the APP
is put on the market the CLOCK STARTS TICKING. 
The moment the clock starts ticking as per the agreement of this
contract and 365 days has passed after the start of the proverbial clock,
PROFITS from the APP sales and receipts will be calculated. </p>
<p>AFRS does not imply or state that they will receive
any profits from sales or revenue from APP#3 at all after the aforementioned
365 day period.  AFRS does not know of
any APP on the market equal to their app creation so it is very difficult to
state what sort of profits can be made from the APP.  It is AFRS’s full intentions and hopes that
this app (APP#3) development and sales and revenues will generate profits.  The purpose and function of this app is
created to generate revenue through its use after the initial sales download of
the APP.  AFRS sole reason and hope for
the production and development and launch of this particular APP (APP#3) is to
generate a profit.</p><br/></div>","LETTER

convention will always honor The Magnificent Seven, this year we have expanded
to include actors from film and TV show westerns as well. We are hoping to book
actors from Deadwood, Young Riders, Yellow Rock, and the recently FAN saved Longmire.

 All donations help us
pay for expenses for our convention


What expenses do we have??
First and foremost the funds will go to cover the costs of the rental of the rooms at the Los Angeles Convention Center.
Secondly, And this is a BIG one. We need funds to secure actors.

And lastly we do cover some costs for panelists (mostly parking at the LACC)


 Not a single penny raised will go towards any of the staff. We do this for fun, we are all volunteers.
Any money left and any profits made from our convention at the end of the event is paid forward to various charities.  This year we have chosen to support the  John Wayne Cancer Institute and the Good Shepherd Shelter of Los Angeles
            

 
Here is a basic example of the poster that is included in the top perk tiers. I stress it is a basic example. The finished product will contain the names of the attending actors.



 THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE PHOTO COLLAGE (I couldn't use photos of the con as it hasn't happened but I used some I took on a vacation) but it gives you an idea how the collage will look

Hesson and I own a wonderful little business in Shreveport called Zombee
Candle. Zombee Candle offers quality, handmade, soy candles since 2010. Over
the years, thanks to my loyal customers, my little business has grown. The time
has come for me to take the next step, but I can’t do it without your help! A
Home for Zombee Candle is a campaign to put money back into the community; an
opportunity to invest in your area and support a local business with big plans.
By purchasing a custom, single-batch, limited edition Zombee, you’ll be
contributing to the start-up cost for Zombee Candle’s new storefront.</span><br/></p>
<p>With your help, ZC
will be able to open a storefront in Highland and contribute to the betterment
of this historic area. This storefront will not only house Zombee Candles, but
also Coven Co. natural body products, other handmade goods as well as used and
rare books. From this store, we can continue our plans to make Zombee Candle a
household name. We love representing Shreveport, Louisiana, and the Gulf Coast
and hope to become the premier source for quality bath and body products. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The start-up costs for
this store front are low, luckily. But, in order to ready the space for the Zombees, we will need some paint – well, a LOT of paint! The store space needs
to have the floors painted and sealed and all the walls painted with two coats. </p>
<p>If your donation meets or exceeds the $30 mark, you'll receive a custom Zombee exclusively made for donors of the store. All money donated during
this campaign will go to renovating the space; paint, shelving, and window
repair are the main repair goals.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>This is an important
project, not just for Zombee Candle, but for Highland and the greater
Shreveport area. The movement to support local businesses is slowly picking up
momentum; people are realizing that putting money back into the community is
good for us all. </p>
<p>Highland is an
ever-changing area, but the heart and soul of the neighborhood is that of
artists, craftspeople, families of all ages and races who want to live in a
safe and prosperous community and keep Highland moving in a positive direction.
The more successful and respectable businesses we can put in our neighborhood,
the better. </p>
<p>Zombee Candle started
out in a spare bedroom on Creswell Avenue and is now sold in five different
stores in the area as well as stores in Alabama and Texas. The possibilities
are endless and we look forward to expanding our business and continuing to
proudly represent Shreveport. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If you’re unable to
help monetarily, please pass this campaign info along to others! And if you’d
like to be contacted about helping us paint and work in the space, please
