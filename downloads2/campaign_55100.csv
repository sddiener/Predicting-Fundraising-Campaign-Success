<div>Endorsed by Craig Avera, fitness trainer to some of Hollywood's top movie stars, the <i style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Inchworm Slider® </i> offers several important and unique features that set it apart from similar types of core fitness devices on the market:</div>

<ul>
<li>Unique design allows for unlimited variety of core exercises</li>
<li>Portable, can be used anywhere</li>
<li>Low profile permits easy storage when not in use</li>
<li>Removable top cushion makes it easy to keep clean</li>

<li>Built in side handles make it easy to carry</li>
<li>Safety panels on each side prevent contact with wheels</li>
<li>Solid, durable construction facilitates years of use</li> </ul> <p>VINTU's mission is to ""surprise and delight"" every customer, by designing and creating products that can help make your life easier and healthier.  As a sports nutritionist, I know first hand how important it is to maintain good health. Maintaining core-body health is particularly important, as our core-body muscles are required for even the most basic activities, such as sitting or standing.   Poor back health associated with lack of good body posture is increasingly becoming a major health issue.</p>
<p>Let's face it, with today's busy lifestyles, most people don't have a lot of time to devote to exercise, much less focus on their core-body muscles;  or, they often engage in exercises that are repetitious, ineffective and not enjoyable.   </p>

<p>My name is Apryl Pooley, and I am a <b>neuroscience
researcher at Michigan State University and author of </b><i><b>Shadow Brain:</b> A Neuroscientist’s Journey Through PTSD and Womanhood</i>.
I am in a unique position of researching the very disorder with which I
live—posttraumatic stress disorder. But no amount of scientific research will
shed light onto what PTSD really is more than learning how this disorder
affects every aspect of one’s life. Therefore, in conjunction with my
scientific research, I openly use my writing to expand public awareness of PTSD
in order to help others recover from this debilitating disorder.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After experiencing a drug-facilitated rape at a
fraternity house in 2003, my closest confidants blamed me for what happened and
discouraged me from telling anybody else. In response, I kept silent and
devoted the next 12 years of my life to figuring out what had happened to my
own brain and body by pursuing college degrees in medical biology and
neuroscience. But the first eight years of my studies were overshadowed by a
battle with substance abuse and what I finally figured out in my doctoral
studies to be PTSD.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>I am now a PhD Candidate in the Michigan State
University Neuroscience Program where I research how PTSD affects the brain in
men and women differently. I pursued science to find a cure for PTSD, but
actually found relief when I stepped away from the microscope to connect with
humanity. I wanted to believe that if I found the biological reason for my
struggles, I would find my cure. But the two most destructive forces that came
out of my trauma, shame and guilt, didn’t leave me until I started sharing my
story with other survivors of campus sexual assault.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The single</b> <b>greatest
risk factor for developing PTSD after trauma is lack of social support</b>. More
than any contributions made by one’s genes, other biological characteristics of
an individual, or aspects of the trauma itself, it is social support that has
the biggest influence on whether someone will develop PTSD. Socially supported
people are allowed to talk about what happened to them, to experience and
express their emotions without ridicule or judgment, to cry and scream and do
whatever their body needs to do to discharge all that energy. With proper
social support—human connection—immediately following trauma, the likelihood of
recovery is exponentially greater. <b>And that is why resources like the MSU
Sexual Assault Program need to have a strong presence on college campuses.</b></p>

My name is Apryl Pooley, and I am a neuroscience
researcher at Michigan State University and author of Shadow Brain: A Neuroscientist’s Journey Through PTSD and Womanhood.
I am in a unique position of researching the very disorder with which I
live—posttraumatic stress disorder. But no amount of scientific research will
shed light onto what PTSD really is more than learning how this disorder
affects every aspect of one’s life. Therefore, in conjunction with my
scientific research, I openly use my writing to expand public awareness of PTSD
in order to help others recover from this debilitating disorder.



After experiencing a drug-facilitated rape at a
fraternity house in 2003, my closest confidants blamed me for what happened and
discouraged me from telling anybody else. In response, I kept silent and
devoted the next 12 years of my life to figuring out what had happened to my
own brain and body by pursuing college degrees in medical biology and
neuroscience. But the first eight years of my studies were overshadowed by a
battle with substance abuse and what I finally figured out in my doctoral
studies to be PTSD.


I am now a PhD Candidate in the Michigan State
University Neuroscience Program where I research how PTSD affects the brain in
men and women differently. I pursued science to find a cure for PTSD, but
actually found relief when I stepped away from the microscope to connect with
humanity. I wanted to believe that if I found the biological reason for my
struggles, I would find my cure. But the two most destructive forces that came
out of my trauma, shame and guilt, didn’t leave me until I started sharing my
story with other survivors of campus sexual assault.


The single greatest
risk factor for developing PTSD after trauma is lack of social support. More
than any contributions made by one’s genes, other biological characteristics of
an individual, or aspects of the trauma itself, it is social support that has
the biggest influence on whether someone will develop PTSD. Socially supported
people are allowed to talk about what happened to them, to experience and
express their emotions without ridicule or judgment, to cry and scream and do
whatever their body needs to do to discharge all that energy. With proper
social support—human connection—immediately following trauma, the likelihood of
recovery is exponentially greater. And that is why resources like the MSU
Sexual Assault Program need to have a strong presence on college campuses.


   The Magnitude of the Problem

One-in-five women will be raped at some point in
their lifetime, with 80% of those occurring before the age of 25. There are 10
million women enrolled as college undergraduates in the U.S. right now, and hundreds
of thousands of them have been raped.

The well-documented consequences of sexual assault
include post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, disordered eating, chronic
pain, substance abuse, and sleep disturbances. Women who have been sexually assaulted
are over 3 times more likely to have a GPA below 2.5 compared to non-victims,
but those who receive proper support go on to be successful students.

There is
a critical window of about one month after experiencing a traumatic event like
sexual assault where intervention is necessary to prevent the development of
PTSD. After a month, the abnormal memory and fear response circuits in the
brain that are associated with PTSD get solidified in a way that it can then
take years to recover. And while recovery is always possible, we cannot make students wait to get help,
because in doing so, we are risking the health of their brain.

We need to have the best resources on college campuses
for survivors of sexual assault, and that is something to be proud of. It’s not
a source of shame to have a comprehensive, coordinated sexual assault or crisis
intervention program, because violence
happens all over the world, it’s how you respond to it that defines your
character and your integrity.
   Impact of the MSU Sexual Assault Program

The MSU Sexual Assault Program responds to those
impacted by sexual violence and works to create a community free of violence
and oppression by providing counseling and support groups to MSU students, a
24-hour crisis hotline, and medical advocacy services offered to anyone in the
greater Lansing community. The Sexual Assault Program has over 150 MSU student,
alumni, faculty, and staff volunteers who have completed a 40-hour crisis
intervention training program. These dedicated individuals provide essential
services to people in need. 


Celebrating
its 35th anniversary this year, the MSU Sexual Assault Program is
the oldest campus-based program of its kind, and MSU students want to help them
celebrate this milestone with a monetary donation.


    Impact of the Gift  

The Michigan State University Sexual Assault Program, which serves around 500 individuals each year,
relies almost entirely on grants and donations, and they are in need of
several critical resources to remain at the cutting-edge of helping students in
need.

One of the therapists would like to get certified
in EMDR therapy, and at the end of my book, I write about how EMDR was a crucial
turning point in my recovery. My hope is that more students will have access to
this service, but the extensive training for certification is expensive.
Additionally, the Sexual Assault Program would
like to build up its resource library with more books and DVDs on healing from
trauma, and they would like to have more promotional outreach so more people know these
amazing services exist.
With our
goal of $10,000, the students will be able to help the MSU Sexual Assault
Program implement these resources, which could impact the lives of hundreds of
students in need.

<p>We are video game developers. We have worked as freelancers making games with Unity the last years, most times cooperating with artists for content. Until we decided to
start our own project, toonfit. Due to low initial budget we had to create content on our own. This way we could keep content quality at the level
we wanted.</p>
<p>Our first
cartoon character is Amanda, a beautiful girl that can convince you and
your kids to workout. Our second one is already in final stages of design and
is an action robot. We want to add variety of cartoons so that kids can choose
their favorite. Kids cannot resist cartoons and exergaming experiences. We are going to need more people, like 3d artists and animators to work for us.</p>

have reached the end of the first and most important development phase, it is

cartoons animated directly from personal trainers using latest motion
capture tech. Cartoons are considered one of the best possible ways to motivate
kids. Toonfit was developed in order to help kids grow up into adults with healthy
lifestyle.




Who we are


We are video game developers. We have worked as freelancers making games with Unity the last years, most times cooperating with artists for content. Until we decided to
start our own project, toonfit. Due to low initial budget we had to create content on our own. This way we could keep content quality at the level
we wanted.
Our first
cartoon character is Amanda, a beautiful girl that can convince you and
your kids to workout. Our second one is already in final stages of design and
is an action robot. We want to add variety of cartoons so that kids can choose
their favorite. Kids cannot resist cartoons and exergaming experiences. We are going to need more people, like 3d artists and animators to work for us.
Now that we
have reached the end of the first and most important development phase, it is
time to ask for support from the awesome audience of Indiegogo.

My name is Jerry Cunningham and this idea has been a longtime coming for me. In 2002 I found myself awoken from a deep sleep. No one was in my apartment, it was quiet on my street, so why was I awake? At that precise moment I had a barrage of information clawing to escape my mind and be brought to life. At 3:13 am I began to write down what i was thinking. 3 hours later I had drawn in detail my vision for something. It was a Stethoscope that had lights inside it allowing the user to receive a rhythmic visual Cue of how there heart looked in real time. In 2002 bringing this invention to life had turned out to be all but impossible.  After thousands of dollars and misleads by an invention firm, I found myself no further ahead than I was in the beginning. L.E.D'S at the time were not being used in every day products as they are today. After 13 years and attempt after attempt. In 2015 I found myself between jobs and had 3 days before starting at a new place of employment. During my transition between jobs, I thought about my invention and felt it was now or never to attempt another prototype. With a 2 year old running around now, time has instantly became a luxury. on the second day of three I had a break through in creating my prototype. Six months after that I saw on my local news, a story about a product that was launched using a website called Indiegogo.com The news excerpt was not lengthy but it contained enough information to reinvigorate my passion for this gift which I dubbed the (STL project).    From  humble  beginnings full of disrepair and frustration I had finally done it! What was previously not in existence, now has a life of its own. Like a child, with the right support and encouragement from friends and family this idea too has no limits in what it may accomplish.<br/><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></span></p></div>","Hello and thank you for taking the time to look at the STL ( Sound to Light ) stethoscope project.

Tasks like learning how to hear and decipher a heartbeat are especially challenging.      What  if there was such a device that allowed the user to exchange the audio cue for a visual cue? New doors and avenues may have just been opened for that person who never dreamed they could make it through the process of being a doctor or nurse with a hearing impairment.      Use of the STL stethoscope is almost identical to a standard acoustic version. With an on off switch you have the control of when to look flashy. The STL is also compatible with a rechargeable power source keeping your STL stethoscope sustainable.
     The STL stethoscope will help facilitate a positive relationship between children and the pediatric staff.  Involving the child in hearing their very own heart beat can engage them and relax them.     Inevitably society continues to progress and evolve, technology has allowed us to eliminate  countless adversities such as an amputee being able to walk for the fist time in years. Such a milestone  is only accomplished by help from technology. But as with most things, new technology tends to be very expensive and hard to obtain.          As a  community we owe it to each other to share this knowledge. With the STL stethoscope we can offset such financial burden associated with brand new technology. Producing the STL stethoscope will cost a fraction of the cost of products such as an amplified stethoscope.
     Helpful donations from you will allow us to transform this early working  prototype into a refined piece of medical equipment. With your assistance we will upgrade the microphone, convert the stethoscope from L.E.D to electric wire which will consume less power extending the life cycle of the batteries,enclose the processor into the stethoscope and upgrade to a rechargeable power source. All funds procured in this campaign will be used for affordable production of the STL stethoscope allowing us to keep cost down making this affordable for all income individuals. Our production date is set for Summer 2016 and with your help is will be achevable.

     Health care is a right, not a privilege and together we can help the STL Project achieve new heights by producing a low cost sustainable medical device that will be affordable for users all over the world.      Many moments of greatness are derived from  humble  beginnings. With your help we can light up the future for individuals looking to excel in the medical field.Hello and thank you for taking the time to look at my (STL) Sound to Light Stethoscope project. My name is Jerry Cunningham and this idea has been a longtime coming for me. In 2002 I found myself awoken from a deep sleep. No one was in my apartment, it was quiet on my street, so why was I awake? At that precise moment I had a barrage of information clawing to escape my mind and be brought to life. At 3:13 am I began to write down what i was thinking. 3 hours later I had drawn in detail my vision for something. It was a Stethoscope that had lights inside it allowing the user to receive a rhythmic visual Cue of how there heart looked in real time. In 2002 bringing this invention to life had turned out to be all but impossible.  After thousands of dollars and misleads by an invention firm, I found myself no further ahead than I was in the beginning. L.E.D'S at the time were not being used in every day products as they are today. After 13 years and attempt after attempt. In 2015 I found myself between jobs and had 3 days before starting at a new place of employment. During my transition between jobs, I thought about my invention and felt it was now or never to attempt another prototype. With a 2 year old running around now, time has instantly became a luxury. on the second day of three I had a break through in creating my prototype. Six months after that I saw on my local news, a story about a product that was launched using a website called Indiegogo.com The news excerpt was not lengthy but it contained enough information to reinvigorate my passion for this gift which I dubbed the (STL project).    From  humble  beginnings full of disrepair and frustration I had finally done it! What was previously not in existence, now has a life of its own. Like a child, with the right support and encouragement from friends and family this idea too has no limits in what it may accomplish.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><u><i><strong>Brief Explanation of the Thyroid Gland</strong></i></u></h2>
<p>Thyroid hormone is needed by every cell in your body.</p>
<p>Hypothyroidism is at epidemic levels, but most people with symptoms have never been diagnosed. Experts have estimated that between 40% to 80% of the population has undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Most doctors do not have the time to research, and therefore they simply apply the recommendations they have been taught at medical school. (incorrect teaching).</p>
<p><strong>The thyroid gland is indispensable for the body's metabolism</strong>. Slow metabolism, (and sometimes an increased metabolism), is the underlying cause of dozens of common health issues, yet doctors don't understand the relevance of altered metabolism. In turn, patients are frustrated by years and years of treatment with no, or little, positive resolution to their symptoms.</p>
<h2><u><i><strong>Digital Mini-Books</strong></i></u></h2>
<p>This series of digital mini-books will give sufferers concise, yet complete, explanations for their dysfunctional thyroid gland, how they can evaluate their thyroid condition, and what they can do proactively, (without drugs), to recover. It will translate medical terminology into explanations that most non-technical people can understand.</p>
<h2><u><i><strong>Who is Keith Nixon?</strong></i></u></h2>
<p>Simply a dedicated health researcher, with a passion for natural, inexpensive and effective solutions to most health issues. I recognise that everyone must be treated as an individual, and many personal circumstances and environmental conditions may impact one person's response when another person is not affected. This is where a complete and intimate analysis of each sufferer's personal timeline and environment can  uncover key mitigating factors. (For instance, a trip to a South American country can result in parasites, resulting in episodes of sweating, which could be mistaken for an overactive thyroid condition).</p>
<p> My personal philosophy is that I have been blessed with a passion for knowledge, and a clarity of thought that allows me to take in many conflicting health propositions and evaluate them to decide ""Is this logical? Is this likely? Has this been supported by real-life cases? etc"".</p>
<p>And I feel that God has blessed me not just for my own benefit, but so that I may be a blessing to others. And as you read some of the unsolicited feedback below, I know that many have been blessed, even if ""blessing"" may not be the word that they might use to express their feelings.</p>
<p>I have enjoyed 66 years of good health, and constantly am frustrated when confronted by stories of health traumas of people who have never been taught about how to live strong, productive, and healthy lives. Like, for instance, the key role of stomach acid in the scheme of things. (Low stomach acid can lead to allergies, asthma, and autoimmune diseases, where your immune system cannot distinguish between ""self"" and ""non-self"" proteins. And stomach acid is critical in making thyroid hormone).</p>
<h2><u><i><strong>Campaign Goals </strong></i></u></h2>
<p>This campaign is aimed at gathering the results of my earlier research into a comprehensive but easily understood series of digital mini-books, with defined, logical steps out of the thyroid maze (and diabetes maze). <u><strong>There is hope for sufferers</strong></u> to be able to enjoy a healthful, productive, and long life.</p>
<p>The campaign will allow this vital information to be more widely distributed, and will provide a sound platform for later extending thyroid knowledge via books, booklets, websites, etc.</p>
<h3><u><strong>Help me to help you and to help others.</strong></u></h3>
</div><div>
<p>I need at least $5,000 to speed up the production of this series of mini-books.</p>
<p>In the event that The campaign doesn't reach it's entire goal, then unused funds will go to Southern Cross Kids Camps in Victoria, Australia, a charity helping kids from 7 to 11 years old that have been disadvantaged, abused, or at risk of abuse. I have been a ""buddy"" on these camps for at least 14 years, and have been excited to experience the changes in kids attitudes and behaviours within as little as 5 days, simply from the kids experiencing someone who cares about them as a person. I encourage you to consider contributing via the specific perk listed in this campaign. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong><i><u>What Is The Potential Impact?</u></i></strong></h3>
<p><span>Do a simple search on ""thyroid years"" and read some of the webpages. Or search for ""thyroid discussion"", or experiment yourself in searches for ""thyroid"". This exercise will immediately provide a multitude of stories from sufferers who have been ""round and round"" the traditional medical circus for years, and who are often confused by inconsistent, and ineffective, advice.</span></p>
<p><span>This series of mini-books provides clear, complete, and simple protocols, a good proportion of which can be undertaken at home, supplemented by professional testing, dental specialists, etc. </span></p>
<p>Potentially, there could be well in excess of 500 million sufferers, with most having no idea of their condition, and no idea of which tissues, organs, and systems may by also be affected. (For instance, why am I cold all the time? Why can't I lose weight?).</p>
<h2><u><i><strong>What Can I Expect?</strong></i></u></h2>
<p>This series of digital mini-books is the key to the understanding of, and recovery from, thyroid dysfunction. It will describe issues in non-medical terms wherever possible, and will provide a clear and workable recovery path. And it will provide the references justifying each of the steps in the ""Seven Steps"" protocol, and a printable ""Cheat Sheet"" providing sufferers with a visual aid to progress, incorporating a timeline, a written record of the results of periodical blood tests, and a written record of your symptoms as they change over time.</p>
<p>It is also intended that contributors be provided with a printable ""How To Diagnose Thyroid Disorders"" sheet, and a printable ""Detox and Diet"" sheet for their own recovery journey, </p>
<p>These three sheets will be able to be freely copied and passed on to others that may also have thyroid symptoms, or have a health challenge that their doctor doesn't know how to treat. (In such cases the doctor simply says ""of unknown etiology"" which means ""I haven't got a clue"")</p>
<p>And the doctor simply runs blood tests , and then their patient that their ""Thyroid is Normal""</p>
<p>Initial contributors will also be given an digital copy of research into ""Flushing Gallstones Naturally"" - another ""epidemic"" health problem in western society, and a key element of restoring proper thyroid gland function.</p>
<p>Many people have benefited from my earlier health research, and my straightforward explanations. Here are some of their comments from a Facebook health group with over 12,000 members worldwide. I do not know these people personally.</p>

We partnered with graphic artist Marieanne Morency, @TheTropicalArtist, to create this unique and colorful yoga mat collection. Marieanne found her passion for the tropics and tropical fauna while exploring places like Hawaii, Mauritius and Reunion Island.

Don’t keep your mat hanging - we’ve designed matching yoga leggings to go with the tropical mat collection!

Impact
Your contribution to this Indiegogo campaign will enable us to collect pre-orders for our new yoga mat collection, help us improve the design and manufacturing process of our existing yoga leggings and allow us to expand into new product categories in the future.

Any donation, large or small and even a share on social will go a long way.
Thanks again for your support!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>T-BALL</strong></h3>
<p>Hi My name is Blase J Toto D.C. DACBSP. My background is in Sports Medicine. I have a multi discipline practice in East Brunswick NJ. I have been a Chiropractor for over 30 years. The T-Ball is a product that replaces the old wooded T-Bars with rubber tips. The head is stainless steel so cleaning is easy between uses. The head can also be heated or cooled for added benefit. You will be funding a high end massage tool to be utilized by professional manual therapists to help rid patients of chronic and acute pain.</p>
<p>You can check out my websites at <strong><a href=""http://www.totodc.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.totodc.com</a></strong> and <strong><a href=""http://www.tototec.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.tototec.net</a>.</strong></p>
<p>I developed the T=Ball after using my thumbs to perform Trigger Point Therapy for 30 years. I still love what I do and I wanted to continue practicing. But the toll on my thumbs, shoulders and neck was starting to effect me. I started looking for products on the market to assist me. Needless to say I couldn't find one that performed the way I needed it to. So I started on the journey of inventing a tool that had the following: aseptic, ergonomic, capable of being heated or cooled, reduce stress on the practitioner and effective on the patient.</p>
<p>After going through several prototypes, I narrowed down on the design. I contacted several American tool manufacturers without success. Finally I found a German company that could make the handle to my specifications. I was successful in securing an American company to make the Stainless Steel Ball Heads.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEz-t-Lxnic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEz-t-Lxnic</a></p>
<p>Now I am onto the next phase. I am developing and designing different shaped heads to accomplish other forms of soft tissue mobilization. The funding from this campaign will be used to design, make molds and packaging. This way I can put together a complete set of heads with the T- handle.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Funding needed is for the Engineering CAD and then to produce the prototype, which will then be used for producing a video of the cleaning device in shower to develop pre-manufacturing sales. Each person who donates will be given that amount reduction in the purchase price of my shower device, plus another 10% discount in price. When you choose to donate, please leave you contact information, so that you will be able to receive the reduced pricing for your purchase of the full body shower device. I will be asking permission from each of you, to use your name on television commercials, as being the heros who helped me launch the device.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your campaign contribution will be vital in launching my full body shower device in many way.</p>
<p>My Shower device is valuable to you the contributor, as well as to the entire world; for it is a full body cleansing device and an improved health Lymphatic moving and toxin elimination device.<br/>    <br/>Nothing in this world could have guided my engineering thought process more than my beginning with solving problems through creating solutions. I recognized a huge problem in developing the show device and that was how often people develop disease due to not being able to reach their back to clean it. This started me on the pathway to solving that problem and others, such as moving the lymphatic system and making the shower feel so wonderful, you can't wait to return.<br/>   <br/>I have impeccable pride in helping people make the right choices in live at my Aging Younger® natural wellness clinic and to see some of what that is, you can go to my website: <a href=""http://www.AgingYounger.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.AgingYounger.net</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The risks and obstacles I face on the way to achieving my goal, to help the masses in a shower, is that if I do not reach the right amount of people my effort to help others, may fail, I want you, who read and consider helping me to understand how awesome this full body shower device is.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Funding needed is for the Engineering CAD and then to produce the prototype, which will then be used for producing a video of the cleaning device in shower to develop pre-manufacturing sales. Each person who donates will be given that amount reduction in the purchase price of my shower device, plus another 10% discount in price. When you choose to donate, please leave you contact information, so that you will be able to receive the reduced pricing for your purchase of the full body shower device. I will be asking permission from each of you, to use your name on television commercials, as being the heros who helped me launch the device.

What We Need & What You Get
Your campaign contribution will be vital in launching my full body shower device in many way.
My Shower device is valuable to you the contributor, as well as to the entire world; for it is a full body cleansing device and an improved health Lymphatic moving and toxin elimination device.    Nothing in this world could have guided my engineering thought process more than my beginning with solving problems through creating solutions. I recognized a huge problem in developing the show device and that was how often people develop disease due to not being able to reach their back to clean it. This started me on the pathway to solving that problem and others, such as moving the lymphatic system and making the shower feel so wonderful, you can't wait to return.   I have impeccable pride in helping people make the right choices in live at my Aging Younger® natural wellness clinic and to see some of what that is, you can go to my website: http://www.AgingYounger.net

The Impact
The risks and obstacles I face on the way to achieving my goal, to help the masses in a shower, is that if I do not reach the right amount of people my effort to help others, may fail, I want you, who read and consider helping me to understand how awesome this full body shower device is. Just by remembering how difficult it is to clean your back with a hand brush would be huge.  Your back is cleansed very poorly, and when you realize how helpful this full body cleansing device will be in also improving the immune system by moving toxins out of the body by moving the lymphatic system through the friction of the rolling brushes should set your goal to donate and help me launch my invention.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our initial fundraising goal is $50,000. Meeting this goal allows us to complete the development of our app and to enroll beta testers. The final development phase will take approximately four months to complete and an additional 90 days of beta-testing before public release. Any funds raised over the initial fundraising goal will enable us to map out and plug-in additional features for the app (i.e. shoulder replacement, knee injury and others). </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For many, a great concern in undergoing total joint replacement surgery is the fear of pain. OrthoCare 360 helps to alleviate this fear with a comprehensive pain management component, including a network of support after surgery. OrthoCare 360 helps build the confidence you need throughout your joint replacement journey. </p>
<p>Additionally, it's common to question whether or not your joint replacement surgery will actually be successful. Our interactive exercises within the mobile app will guide and coach you every step of the way toward being a JOINT CHAMP in your recovery.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The OrthoCare 360 app is in its final stages of pre-development. The technical framework of the app is almost complete and our development team is standing by. They'll be given instruction to move forward with final development once we reach our initial funding goal. </p>
<p>Our challenges include: Finalizing our diversified group of healthcare professionals for beta-testing and fine-tuning the technical framework. It is anticipated that the beta-testing phase will further increase our initial customer base. </p>
<p>Other challenges include marketing and scaling the app. This is being addressed through our marketing strategy and includes social &amp; digital media, as well as direct contact and industry-specific conferences &amp; exhibits. The app will be built on the Amazon AWS platform, allowing for even greater scalability and to efficiently address the challenge of rapid growth.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I am a vegan chef in Oklahoma City and I own a startup business called Health Koncious! Health Koncious is more of a movement (VEGALOUTION)  that encourages the community to learn more about plant based diets, and create an affordable and accessible plant based diet to all incomes. We do free food demos at schools, grocery stores, Vo techs, we go to festivals all over Oklahoma as well as grocery store tours for families who are overweight. I pride myself in the quality of service we provided and the cultural shifts we are creating in the Oklahoma Metro Area. I also have a ""Step-Up"" program that trains ex felons an troubled youths the trade of culinary arts. Health Koncious was founded in May of 2016 and instantly grew. Although Oklahoma is a meat, potatoes, and fast food state that is ranked No 2 in the heart disease death rate. But the silver lining has been nothing but success stories with  encouraging healthier plant based options to the table. I was a Chef before I was a vegan so I pride myself in my plant based comfort classic recipes and ability to transition Carnivores into Plant eaters. I've received most of my attention through my soul food recipes such as my vegan, mac n cheese, BBQ pulled pork, fried chicken, and nachos. I am currently working towards a book that will be going through the editing process by 2/28/2017. It is a run down on a whole food plant based diets. How nutrition works in layman's terms and includes meal plans and recipes for known holistic preventive care treatments for common issues such as skin, depression, obesity, diabetes, etc. Its going to be Great addition to Health Koncious 2017! Health Koncious is currently going through branding changes with plans to get into meal prep an manufacturing by 2018, and complete our mission to creating a plant based product that is affordable, accessible, and functional to all incomes.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are in need for 15,000 to support the startup funds for Health Koncious to publish ""TheMillenials Guide to Plant-Based Diets"", as well as manufacture her many specialty items: protein powders, dairy free cheese sauce, and seitan (faux chicken). We are currently in need of a commercialized kitchen with plaenty of walkin space to hold all of our meal prep orders. As well as kitchen equipment. This will not fundme andmy dreamsthis will also create jobs for non violent ex fellons and tennagers interested in the culinary arts field.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The idea for Health Koncious was birthed through a series of life events beginning with the tragic unexpected death of Chef Nicole Asalis closest friend at the ripe age of 26 to an auto immune disease called Lupus. “Having a loved one taken by an auto immune disease that has been proven to be preventable with a plant based diet is one of the most awakening things that can happen to you. I didn’t know then what our food does to us but now I’m empowered by the possibilities of saving another’s life simply by informing them. I know Health Koncious can spark that chabge.” – says Nicole Asali</p>
<p>Once Chef Asali decided to make go fully plant-based with her personal diet she soon collided into multiple hurdles such as: reading and understanding labels, knowing where to shop, knowing what to eat, understanding how to prepare the food, affording organic products, staying committed without support from friends and family, enjoying the food she ate, missing comfort foods, and eating family meals on the Holidays. These all became real problems that didn’t have any functional resolutions. “Living a healthy plant based lifestyle became exhausting and felt impossible”</p>
<p>She knew she was fully committed but completely understood why someone wouldn’t want to transition into a plant-based diet. So she decided to create something that could help ordinary people transition into a plant based lifestyle. “ Its not about being perfect or eating how I tell you too.

<p>Even if you're not one of the over <a href=""http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/facts/cannabis/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">147 million people worldwide who smoke cannabis</a>, you ARE part of a HUGE demographic: ""people who've been affected (directly or
indirectly) by cancer."" After all, in 2012, over <a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">14 million new cases of cancer were diagnosed</a> worldwide, and that number is <a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">projected to climb to 22 million in the next 2 decades</a>. Consequently, cannabis
has become the fastest growing industry in the US—with the industry pulling in an <a href=""http://www.arcviewmarketresearch.com/media-coverage/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">estimated $2.7B USD</a> in 2014 (almost half of that coming from the medical cannabis industry.)</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>“Yeah,
right...medical cannabis”</b> you may be thinking to yourself, and to be fair: you're not alone. In fact, even though <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/07/marijuana-use-in-adults-recreational_n_2200463.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1 in 10 adults over 50</a> in the US admit to smoking cannabis, the long-held stigma of cannabis (and its users) has
been an ever-present barrier in our society. However, even though
propaganda campaigns (including films like “Reefer Madness”)
actively worked to turn the public against cannabis in years past,
more and more people are starting to learn the truth about its
legitimate role as a safe and effective form of medicine--including <a href=""https://www.leafly.com/news/health/government-run-cancer-institute-quietly-acknowledges-that-cannabi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the ability of cannabis to kill cancer cells</a>. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Recent <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Healthday/story?id=7235037"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">studies out of Spain</a> have provided strong evidence towards the
ability of THC and CBD (2 of the over 100 cannabinoids found in
cannabis) to not only <b>kill</b> cancer cells—but also leave
surrounding “normal” cells alone. And in San Francisco,
California, two scientists recently demonstrated cannabinoids'
<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/19/marijuana-and-cancer_n_1898208.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">abilities to stop metastasis in many kinds of aggressive cancer</a>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And the list goes
on and on... In addition to its <a href=""http://naturalsociety.com/marijuana-kills-cancer-cells-admits-the-u-s-national-cancer-institute/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">applications for cancer patients</a>, cannabis
has been shown to <a href=""http://www.geteyesmart.org/eyesmart/living/medical-marijuana-glaucoma-treament.cfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">provide relief from glaucoma</a> and <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/cannabis-for-ms-can-it-help-treat-symptoms/expert-answers/faq-20112500"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Multiple Sclerosis</a>, to safely-increase appetite <a href=""http://norml.org/library/item/human-immunodeficiency-virus-hiv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">for AIDS patients</a>, to help minimize and <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/07/health/charlotte-child-medical-marijuana/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">prevent seizures</a> in Epileptics (including children), and to <a href=""http://www.unitedpatientsgroup.com/blog/2014/07/08/how-cannabis-helps-with-bipolar-disorder/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">improve cognitive function in bipolar disorder patients</a>. And if the previous stats still haven't convinced you, <a href=""https://www.projectcbd.org/conditions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here's a list of over 50 conditions</a> that THC and CBD from cannabis can help treat.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Perhaps you're still a bit skeptical—and that's okay. So was our
founder, Adam Aufderheide, before he learned firsthand the benefits
of cannabis cancer treatment. Adam was diagnosed with Hodgkin's
Lymphoma in 2014, and found that his chemotherapy resulted
in debilitating joint and back pain, overwhelming nausea, little
to no appetite, and actually made food (even water) taste awful. After over a year of treatments and doctor visits,
thankfully, Adam is now cancer-free--and he credits cannabis for helping him make it through. (<a href=""http://bestbudsgardenpdx.com#adams-story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read more of Adam's story here</a>)</p>
<p><b><i>“I just want to shout it from the rooftops—cannabis is a
miracle plant! It's safe, it's natural, it's affordable, and it doesn't
have the laundry list of side effects like all of the prescription
medication I was prescribed. <span style=""color: #cc0000;"">All I needed was cannabis. That was
enough for me to deal with chemotherapy.</span>”-Adam</i></b></p>
<p>And it was at this point the idea for “Best Buds Garden” was
formed. Chemotherapy is expensive, and the side effects are often debilitating. What's worse is that the people who need relief the most are the ones who many times don't have access to (or knowledge of) available alternatives. This is why Best Buds Garden is dedicated to helping relieve the pain and suffering that comes along with chemotherapy by donating medical grade cannabis free of charge to local cancer patients. Best Buds Garden is also dedicated to donating 10% of it's revenue to cancer research organizations around the United States. </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px;""><b>Where You Come In</b></span></p>
</div><div>
<h3></h3>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">
</span></p>
<p>We're launching
“Best Buds Garden”—a community-driven cannabis garden
here in Portland, Oregon. In addition to growing and donating high-grade medical cannabis to local cancer patients and other
seriously-ill residents, we will be providing ongoing donations
towards local and national cancer relief organizations. Our goal is to push towards a self-sustaining operation, which
will be able to further support the local community with our annual charity fund raiser where
100% of the money raised will go directly to local
cancer relief groups and their patients.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our target for this
campaign is a modest $30,000. This amount will be used to help us secure a safe and clean grow
space, pay for licensing and equipment, and cover some of our
operating expenses (electricity, quality strains, etc.) while we get things up and running. 100% of the donations from this campaign will be used to fund this project, no money raised will be used on employee salaries as we are all volunteers.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>If you can donate
at least $50 or $100</b>, it will go a long way towards making this
initiative a reality. But even if we don't meet our mark, we're still determined to push forward—and we sincerely appreciate anything you are
willing and able to do. Your donation WILL make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>There's no denying
it: cannabis isn't the “demon plant” it once was thought to be.
There is no better time than right now to make your voice heard, and
to show your support for a good cause. Together, we can really make a
positive impact in the world.</i></p>

</div><div><br/></div></div>","Even if you're not one of the over 147 million people worldwide who smoke cannabis, you ARE part of a HUGE demographic: ""people who've been affected (directly or
indirectly) by cancer."" After all, in 2012, over 14 million new cases of cancer were diagnosed worldwide, and that number is projected to climb to 22 million in the next 2 decades. Consequently, cannabis
has become the fastest growing industry in the US—with the industry pulling in an estimated $2.7B USD in 2014 (almost half of that coming from the medical cannabis industry.)


“Yeah,
right...medical cannabis” you may be thinking to yourself, and to be fair: you're not alone. In fact, even though 1 in 10 adults over 50 in the US admit to smoking cannabis, the long-held stigma of cannabis (and its users) has
been an ever-present barrier in our society. However, even though
propaganda campaigns (including films like “Reefer Madness”)
actively worked to turn the public against cannabis in years past,
more and more people are starting to learn the truth about its
legitimate role as a safe and effective form of medicine--including the ability of cannabis to kill cancer cells. 



Recent studies out of Spain have provided strong evidence towards the
ability of THC and CBD (2 of the over 100 cannabinoids found in
cannabis) to not only kill cancer cells—but also leave
surrounding “normal” cells alone. And in San Francisco,
California, two scientists recently demonstrated cannabinoids'
abilities to stop metastasis in many kinds of aggressive cancer.


And the list goes
on and on... In addition to its applications for cancer patients, cannabis
has been shown to provide relief from glaucoma and Multiple Sclerosis, to safely-increase appetite for AIDS patients, to help minimize and prevent seizures in Epileptics (including children), and to improve cognitive function in bipolar disorder patients. And if the previous stats still haven't convinced you, here's a list of over 50 conditions that THC and CBD from cannabis can help treat.


Perhaps you're still a bit skeptical—and that's okay. So was our
founder, Adam Aufderheide, before he learned firsthand the benefits
of cannabis cancer treatment. Adam was diagnosed with Hodgkin's
Lymphoma in 2014, and found that his chemotherapy resulted
in debilitating joint and back pain, overwhelming nausea, little
to no appetite, and actually made food (even water) taste awful. After over a year of treatments and doctor visits,
thankfully, Adam is now cancer-free--and he credits cannabis for helping him make it through. (Read more of Adam's story here)
“I just want to shout it from the rooftops—cannabis is a
miracle plant! It's safe, it's natural, it's affordable, and it doesn't
have the laundry list of side effects like all of the prescription
medication I was prescribed. All I needed was cannabis. That was
enough for me to deal with chemotherapy.”-Adam
And it was at this point the idea for “Best Buds Garden” was
formed. Chemotherapy is expensive, and the side effects are often debilitating. What's worse is that the people who need relief the most are the ones who many times don't have access to (or knowledge of) available alternatives. This is why Best Buds Garden is dedicated to helping relieve the pain and suffering that comes along with chemotherapy by donating medical grade cannabis free of charge to local cancer patients. Best Buds Garden is also dedicated to donating 10% of it's revenue to cancer research organizations around the United States. 
Where You Come In




We're launching
“Best Buds Garden”—a community-driven cannabis garden
here in Portland, Oregon. In addition to growing and donating high-grade medical cannabis to local cancer patients and other
seriously-ill residents, we will be providing ongoing donations
towards local and national cancer relief organizations. Our goal is to push towards a self-sustaining operation, which
will be able to further support the local community with our annual charity fund raiser where
100% of the money raised will go directly to local
cancer relief groups and their patients.


Our target for this
campaign is a modest $30,000. This amount will be used to help us secure a safe and clean grow
space, pay for licensing and equipment, and cover some of our
operating expenses (electricity, quality strains, etc.) while we get things up and running. 100% of the donations from this campaign will be used to fund this project, no money raised will be used on employee salaries as we are all volunteers.


If you can donate
at least $50 or $100, it will go a long way towards making this
initiative a reality. But even if we don't meet our mark, we're still determined to push forward—and we sincerely appreciate anything you are
willing and able to do. Your donation WILL make a difference.


There's no denying
it: cannabis isn't the “demon plant” it once was thought to be.
There is no better time than right now to make your voice heard, and
to show your support for a good cause. Together, we can really make a
positive impact in the world.

<p>Story of Croatian men’s softball started in 2003 when our men’s
team went for the first time to the European Championships in Czech Republic.
We knew that sport is similar to baseball, but we didn’t expect such a high
level of competition there. I just felt in love with a sport. That sport gave
me a lot of happiness, trips and most importantly I met a lot of friends all
around Europe. I gave myself a lifetime mission to coach kids softball in one
poor neighborhood in Zagreb. I wanted to give those kids a chance to try that
sport, that gave me so much. <br/></p>

it. And for the last 10 years I coach kids in one public park. We don’t have I
field, no clubhouse, not much of equipment, no coaches and all other things
needed for good practice. Even like that, those kids become strong players and
dedicated to that sport. I feel so much happiness when I see them smiling,
playing and winning at the field. After many years of practicing, they become
players for our men’s national team, men’s club teams, they are winning juniors
and cadets national baseball titles. And the most of it, they love to play for
their national softball junior team. <br/>

World Championships. In 2012 our federation spend all reserves money to send us
to Argentina to worlds. I cant describe you feeling those kids had playing in

<p>My name is David Rosenthal. I am the founder of ""PLANET KITCHEN"" with its vision of ""Healthy Food, Healthy Life, Healthy Planet"". I have worked in food service industries for over 3 decades. My ""eye opening"" moment happened in 2010 after grocery shopping at Costco (currently one of the top providers of organic foods). I was inspired that day to further research our food system and share my knowledge of how to create meals using REAL ingredients offering balanced nutritional options focused on what is local and easily available. This is when the concept for ""PK"" was born. In 2015 ""PK"" launched its first wellness product, a daily shot of infused nutrition we call ""PFM FIRE TONIC"". </p>
<p>The mission of ""Planet Kitchen"" <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">is to share the message that consuming nutritional foods is the foundation for positive life style changes. By providing wellness products and services, we educate and empower people to heal and inspire humanity towards wellness. We teach the ""Food Is Medicine"" philosophy so people can understand how eating organic foods, (locally sourced when possible or growing your own) </span>maintaining<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> a balanced
lifestyle, and making </span>conscious<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> sustainable choices will help us all restore harmony in ourselves and with our planet. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In 2015 I was given an incredible opportunity to be a part of a sustainable Land Project near Asheville NC. Moving to the Land Project, surrounded by the mountains of NC, and inspired by nature, I set out to make my own wellness remedies and personal care products. On a cold day in February I found a recipe called Fire Cider from the ""Godmother of American Herbalism"" the AMAZING Rosemary Gladstar. This became the recipe of base ingredients for what is now our ""PFM FIRE TONIC"". With a new home for ""PK"", access to a private kitchen, organically farmed local ingredients and a community of like minds, I </span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">began the journey of creating a customized formula that adds more immune boosting ingredients to compliment a variety of ""PFM FIRE TONIC"" products. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">After creating our blend and personally experiencing the amazing health and wellness benefits of this product, I shared my first batch of ""PFM FIRE TONIC"" with friends and family.

It was now time to share this ""Immune Boosting Magic"" with as many people as possible.
There are many benefits associated with our ""PFM FIRE TONIC"" products, starting with our ZERO waste production. We are currently able to produce three products from the one fermentation process. We utilize fifteen organic (locally sourced when possible), GMO free ingredients and continue the fermentation process by immersing them in raw, unfiltered, unpasteurized apple cider vinegar for five weeks. We then drain the infused liquid into bottles for our ""PFM FIRE TONIC"", the remaining ingredients are then jarred for our ""PFM FIRE RELISH"", and a portion of the relish is dehydrated and ground into a powder for our 'PFM FIRE SPICE"" blends and salts. 
By continuing to perfect our zero waste processes we hope to inspire other businesses to makes the same commitment to sustainable little to no waste products.
This IndieGoGo campaign is important to all of us because health in this country is rapidly declining and products like ""PFM FIRE TONIC"" support wellness and the sustainability of our planet.

Reaching our goal is important, however, any amount of funding will support the next batch of ""PFM FIRE TONIC"", as the amounts can be scaled to utilize your generous contributions as we continue production.

<li>Ayurveda personalizes a person’s healing regimen based on the balancing of their unique energetic patterns (known as ‘Doshas’).</li>
<li>Ayurveda has catalogued over 9,000 plants and herbs, each with unique medicinal properties.</li>
<li>There are approximately 1.5 million Ayurveda practitioners worldwide - but only 3,000 in the United States.</li>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Did you know that many of even the most reputable supplement manufacturers don’t know where their ingredients come from? This puts consumers at a huge risk of exposure to harmful ingredients like GMOs, toxic metals and pesticides.</span> </div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our Seed-To-Table approach aims to set a new standard in the quality, efficacy, purity, transparency, sustainability and ethics of supplement production. </span><br/>

<h3><b>3. We’re setting up a network of Ayurvedic training &amp; treatment platforms</b></h3>

</div>
<div>One of our biggest goals with the Ancient Health Care Project is to create training and consultation platforms that serve Ayurvedic practitioners, students and patients.</div>

<div> 
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://625enterprises.com/ah/igg/images_new/students.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<div><br/></div>
<h5>Some of these platforms include:</h5>
<div><br/></div>
<ul>
<li>A Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant telemedicine platform that will link up patients and practitioners.</li>
<li>Two Ayurveda retreats, starting with our first one this April, which will culminate in a certification program for aspiring Ayurvedic practitioners.</li>
<li>A training and resource platform where we will create e-courses and tools like spice and oil kits - and give other Ayurvedic producers the opportunity to work with us.</li>
<li>An eventual Ayurvedic school that will bring all of the above together under one roof.</li>
</ul>
These training and consultation platforms are vital in empowering us to not only heal more students and clients; but to also train more Ayurvedic practitioners who will help us reach our goal of reaching 20 million people by the end of the year.</div>

<br/><p><strong>A message from Amish Shah, founder of the Ancient Health Care Project:</strong></p>
<em><p><br/></p>
<p>Every initiative we’ve created for the Ancient Health Care Project is there for a strategic reason, but it’s also part of our personal story.</p>
<p>The film is a moving diary of my team’s journey across India and the United States.</p>
<p>The supplements are the culmination of every herb, spice and nutrient we’ve been recommended by the world’s top Ayurvedic physicians - and many contain the exact ingredients I personally took to heal from my illnesses; which included fatty liver, depression and high cholesterol.</p>
<p>And the e-courses and retreats are designed with the exact same detoxification, relaxation and healing protocols I experienced on my own healing journey and Panchakarma.</p>The perks we’ve prepared are here to take you on your own process of discovery, learning and healing. And to empower both you and the planet with the holistic wellbeing we were born to have.<br/></em>

<strong>Amish Shah, Founder</strong>
Ayurveda has been in Amish’s family for generations, but he only started paying serious attention to it after a health scare in his late twenties. Since then he has drawn on his experience as an Inc. 500 entrepreneur to spread awareness and education for Ayurveda and other bodies of ancient wisdom.

As a dentist with three teacher trainings in yoga and meditation, plus her own family’s roots in herbal healing, Dr. Puja has always been passionate about integrative medicine.

<b style=""background-color: initial;""><i>“Ayurveda says we can understand how this intelligent functions, and if we address health at that deep, deep level where the body is becoming the body, is becoming matter, is going from intelligence or pure nothingness into matter, then we can really transform health from the deepest, deepest level. “</i></b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> - Dr. Nancy Lonsdorf</span><br/>

</div></div>","UPDATE, Mar 2nd 2016: What will it REALLY take to end disease and heal the planet?Healing the world of its modern ailments is no easy feat.For most of us, it will take consistent willpower and guidance to get unhooked from the artificial, chemical-laced convenience food we rely on.And more education is needed before the masses realize there are natural alternatives to many of the side effect-heavy pharmaceuticals we’re swallowing daily.So we have to be realistic about this:Just one film, or just one supplement line, or just one series of retreats are unlikely to create the IMPACT we need to spark a global healing revolution.We have to go deeper… And we’re doing that by combining all these initiatives into what we call a HEALING ECOSYSTEM that will help millions of people adopt a holistic Ayurvedic lifestyle.Here’s what this ecosystem looks like:In a nutshell…=> The film will serve as an entry point to raise interest and awareness for Ayurveda.=> We’ll then help you apply this awareness into a daily lifestyle, through training programs and retreats focusing on Ayurvedic food, supplements and treatments.=> We’ll also give you the option to receive professional Ayurvedic consultations through our HIPAA-compliant telemedicine platform that lets you consult with a world-class Ayurvedic physician from the comfort of your home.=> You’ll also have the choice of stocking up on our Seed-To-Table supplements, spices and other upcoming Ayurvedic supplies.=> Then - and this is where the ecosystem comes full circle - you’ll be invited to take our certification program, where you can build a lucrative and rewarding hobby or business as an Ayurvedic practitioner… as you spread the benefits of Ayurveda to others in an exponentially growing network of teachers and students.I’ll be honest with you - with just our small team, it’s highly unlikely we can reach our goal of touching 20 million lives.But with this Healing Ecosystem - and with YOUR support… this healing revolution is inevitable.As our Indiegogo campaign draws to a close, we urgently need your support by:1) SHARING the campaign page through social media and email.2) Selecting a PERK that entitles you to a variety of training materials, supplements, retreats and other Ayurvedic services and supplies within our Healing Ecosystem… all at a generous discount from the usual retail price.The campaign ends this Sunday, so please do this as soon as you can:Amish ShahFounder of Ancient Health Care


-------

Every day, our modern lifestyle is tearing us further away from the holistic wellbeing we were born to have:
Crushing stress… spiking obesity levels… sedentary lifestyles… GMOs that make up 80% of our diet… over 75,000 types of artificial chemicals in our food and household products...    

And a broken medical system that causes over 400,000 unnecessary deaths per year in the United States alone.







Our planet is in urgent need of a healing revolution; and it’s clear the answers we seek lie beyond our current relationship with health and wellness.   





The Ancient Health Care Project is a small team of passionate medical professionals, integrative medicine practitioners and entrepreneurs on a mission to spread the gift of holistic wellbeing.

Our goal is to liberate society from the illness, stress and toxicity of modern living... 



By reviving the 6,000-year-old wellbeing science known as Ayurveda. And reaching out to at least 20 million people in 2016 through a number of initiatives that promote healing, awareness and education.

Here are the many ways YOU can experience and support the Ancient Health Care Project:

















 “Wait a second, Ayur-what?” 



Ayurveda (“life knowledge” in Sanskrit) is a holistic health care system that can be traced back to the secret texts of ancient India. 


The main principle of Ayurveda is about living in harmony with both mother nature, and your unique body composition.   
 



  


Instead of the chemicals, invasive surgeries and one-size-fits-all approach you’ll find in many aspects of modern medicine, Ayurveda shows you...     




What to eat and what to avoid, according to your body type...
How to make the right lifestyle choices...
How to eject toxins from your body through specific massages and exercises…
How to enrich your diet with nutrient-dense herbs and supplements…
And even how to reconnect with the essence of who you really are.



 

Fast facts about Ayurveda:   



Ayurveda is a lifestyle; covering food, herbs, supplements, massage, exercise, and even lifestyle modifications according to the 4 seasons.
Ayurveda personalizes a person’s healing regimen based on the balancing of their unique energetic patterns (known as ‘Doshas’).
Ayurveda has catalogued over 9,000 plants and herbs, each with unique medicinal properties.
There are approximately 1.5 million Ayurveda practitioners worldwide - but only 3,000 in the United States.


So here’s the plan…

    
1. We’re launching an Ayurveda documentary film in May 2016
 







Filmed in the United States and India, the Ancient Health Care film is an eye-opening deep dive into the world of modern-day Ayurveda, and the extraordinary people and institutions who are harnessing it to save and elevate millions of lives every day.





We intend to use this film as an awareness and education tool that will expose millions of people to the truth about Ayurveda; and how it can elevate their lives.



The Ancient Health Care film in numbers:










Participants in the Ancient Health Care film include…









John Hagelin, PhD: Quantum Physicist & public policy expert

Sankari Wegman, PhD: Head Ayurvedic Practitioner, The Raj Ayurveda Health Spa, Fairfield, Iowa

This May, the Ancient Health Care documentary film will be released online and at multiple premiere events in San Diego, New York and India.


WANT TO WATCH THE FILM?


Select a perk worth $10 or more and get digital access to the film in May OR get a physical DVD for $25 or more.







2. We’re launching a line of Ayurvedic supplements through our unique ‘Seed-To-Table’ approach:






Did you know that many of even the most reputable supplement manufacturers don’t know where their ingredients come from? This puts consumers at a huge risk of exposure to harmful ingredients like GMOs, toxic metals and pesticides. 


Our Seed-To-Table approach aims to set a new standard in the quality, efficacy, purity, transparency, sustainability and ethics of supplement production. 



Seed-To-Table means we’re in charge of every step of our supplements’ production and supply chain - from the procurement of the farming land to the harvesting and bottling, to the distribution.




 

Seed-To-Table ultimately means a supplement of the highest quality that is good for your body, for the farmers and workers who produced it, and for the planet.



We have studied the 9,000 plants and herbs in the Ayurvedic dictionary, and narrowed them down to what you need most to stay healthy and energized in your hectic daily life:




ELEVATE YOUR WELLBEING WITH OUR SEED-TO-TABLE SUPPLEMENTS
Every perk worth $200 or more gives you a supply of three of our most essential supplements: Turmeric, Bacopa and Triphala. You also get an Ancient Health Care Spice Pack containing 6 vials of nutrient-dense spices: fenugreek, fennel, coriander, mustard seeds, cumin and turmeric.




3. We’re setting up a network of Ayurvedic training & treatment platforms


One of our biggest goals with the Ancient Health Care Project is to create training and consultation platforms that serve Ayurvedic practitioners, students and patients.

 


Some of these platforms include:


A Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant telemedicine platform that will link up patients and practitioners.
Two Ayurveda retreats, starting with our first one this April, which will culminate in a certification program for aspiring Ayurvedic practitioners.
A training and resource platform where we will create e-courses and tools like spice and oil kits - and give other Ayurvedic producers the opportunity to work with us.
An eventual Ayurvedic school that will bring all of the above together under one roof.

These training and consultation platforms are vital in empowering us to not only heal more students and clients; but to also train more Ayurvedic practitioners who will help us reach our goal of reaching 20 million people by the end of the year.


RECEIVE WORLD-CLASS AYURVEDIC TREATMENT OR TRAINING


From 60-minute telemedicine consultations to spots at our upcoming retreats to coaching certification programs, our list of perks gives you a wide range of options - whether you’re a patient or an aspiring practitioner.


 
 Ancient Health Care Project timeline:




The Ancient Health Care Project ‘Healing Ecosystem’:








The Ancient Health Care Project funding requirements:



Up to this point, the Ancient Health Care Project has been completely privately funded - from documentary filming and logistics, to supplement production and R&D, to planning on the upcoming telemedicine and certification platforms. 



We have now however entered the costly last stretch of the project, which will determine the final quality of our productions, and the volume of people who are exposed to them.
  More specifically we need funding to:




1. Complete the post production on the documentary, and finish with the kind of film National Geographic would be proud of.


2. Complete production of the supplements, spice kits, e-courses and telemedicine platform.

3. Design and pay for promotional campaigns and live events that will allow us to spread the message of Ayurveda to millions.

4. Finance not only our team, but contractors and consultants who will allow us to create the best possible products, and make the biggest possible impact.



Our funding goal for this campaign is $150,000 - and we need YOUR help to achieve a Healing Revolution

A message from Amish Shah, founder of the Ancient Health Care Project:

Every initiative we’ve created for the Ancient Health Care Project is there for a strategic reason, but it’s also part of our personal story.
The film is a moving diary of my team’s journey across India and the United States.
The supplements are the culmination of every herb, spice and nutrient we’ve been recommended by the world’s top Ayurvedic physicians - and many contain the exact ingredients I personally took to heal from my illnesses; which included fatty liver, depression and high cholesterol.
And the e-courses and retreats are designed with the exact same detoxification, relaxation and healing protocols I experienced on my own healing journey and Panchakarma.The perks we’ve prepared are here to take you on your own process of discovery, learning and healing. And to empower both you and the planet with the holistic wellbeing we were born to have.





We are also donating 10% of proceeds from this campaign to various charities including the Shah Education and Exploration Fund (SEEF) which will contribute towards sponsoring clinical trials, building ayurvedic schools, creating scholarships and grants and furthering education and ayurveda infrastructure.










Meet the Ancient Health Care Project Team:




Amish Shah, Founder
Ayurveda has been in Amish’s family for generations, but he only started paying serious attention to it after a health scare in his late twenties. Since then he has drawn on his experience as an Inc. 500 entrepreneur to spread awareness and education for Ayurveda and other bodies of ancient wisdom.


“Ayurveda saved my life, and with the right education and awareness, I believe it can help save the planet too.”




Puja Shah, Co-Founder
As a dentist with three teacher trainings in yoga and meditation, plus her own family’s roots in herbal healing, Dr. Puja has always been passionate about integrative medicine. But it was only after birthing her first child, and seeing how quickly Ayurvedic treatments helped her recover, that she realized the extent of this ancient science’s power.


“The birth of my healthiest self came from this ancient science of life. It's an awakening all of the world deserves to feel.”

What some of the world’s leading Ayurvedic experts are saying about The Ancient Health Care Project:


“The beauty of Ayurvedic medicine is the reason to disconnect between the mind and the body, the emotional body and the physical body are one. When you take something to cleanse your physical body, you'll cleanse your emotional body also.“ - Dr. Trupti Gokani


“I’ve devoted 25 years to practicing Ayurveda and using it in my medical practice, because I discovered I didn’t learn anything about health in medical school.” - Dr. Kulreet Chaudhary



Ayurveda teaches us that nothing is right for everyone. Everything is right for someone, and Ayurveda is the path of understanding what's right for you.” - Dr. Marc Halpern



“Ayurveda says we can understand how this intelligent functions, and if we address health at that deep, deep level where the body is becoming the body, is becoming matter, is going from intelligence or pure nothingness into matter, then we can really transform health from the deepest, deepest level. “ - Dr. Nancy Lonsdorf




 


Our goal is to spread the science of Ayurveda to at least 20 million people this year, and we’re not going to get there without YOUR help!

</div></div>","Short Summary



„Innovation is taking what is not true in the present and making it the true in the future. Our innovations started  as dreams, as fictions, as fantasy.  They — our ideas — are what we live inside of, and are our path to meaning, to belonging and to great actions. We are innovative and passionate in everything we set out to achieve, to constantly exceed expectations through the most efficient and high value-added solution.“


Crystal Idea is Croatian innovative company that was founded in 2013 with the goal of developing advanced technology and innovative products. Crystal Idea has always been inspired by the harmony and power of nature, which is incorporated into all of our products such as Dalma cabin that produces Mediterranean climatic effects, brand „eco health zone“ and our two latest product iTHERAPY and Crystal Chamber which are closely related.
























Combining sensors, micro controllers and smart materials, we created new device that your living space transformers into  oasis of life and gives you new approach to self healing.



Picture and size can be customized according to your wishes.






Changing colors can be customized. 



When indoor air is polluted iTherapy automatically turns on, starts a process of purification and enrichment of air.





This high-tech device has superior performance, beautiful design and  is easy to use. Based on a revolutionary technology for keeping living spaces clean and safe. Inspired by the natural mechanisms, iTHERAPY is equally multifunctional, technically advanced and stylish design as well as easy to use. It will allow you to enjoy the fresh air as if you were in the forest all around you. It filters, purifies and enriches the air with negative ions (anions).














If you think that this innovative high-tech device is cool and suitable for you, we have one more surprise that will delight you. 





                                               


                        


              







System in the iTHERAPY is fully automated but you can also automatically turn on or off. Through the sensor and filtering system iTHERAPY detects the value of harmful substances in the air, removes them, purifies and ionizes the air.



















This high-tech device is interactive because it „communicates“ with user. How? It is made from a smart material that have properties that react to changes in their indoor environment. It gives users information about pollution (negative effects of radiation, caused by electrical devices (TV, computers, electrical, installation, mobile phones ...) particles of dust, pollen, smoke and odor) inside the room by changing color in the picture.
iTHERAPY is not just a classic ion air purifier, it’s a smart revolutionary device  that detects the amount of harmful gases, odors, bacteria, germs and viruse in the air and removes them from the air. How? By the different sensors that can detect particles in the air above 0.03μm, such as cigarette smoke, house dust, mold, pollen, spores, etc., when they are within the sensing range, due to the dust generated by the light scattering, the scattered light incident on the light receiving element, is converted to an electrical signal, and then through a series of after the algorithm to form the output voltage, sensor anti-light type, and can be used to detect a variety of environments. Odor sensor can detect formaldehyde, benzene, carbon monoxide, ammonia, hydrogen, alcohol, cigarette smoke, perfumes and other organic vapors with high sensitivity.




Don't you wish that you could breath fresh clean air indoors? Do you have allergies, suffer from pet dander? Does anybody in your home smoke? If you answered yes to any of these, please consider a revolutionary device iTHERAPY.  iTHERAPY effectively purify your indoor air and protect your family from harmful allergens and pollutants. iTHERAPY air purifier technology uses cold plasma discharge that consists of positive ions (H+) and negative ions (O2) from water vapor in the air. These ions have the property of clustering around micro particles and gases, and thus, they surround harmful substances such as airborne mold, virus, bacteria, volatile organic compounds and allergens.At that point, a chemical reaction occurs on the cell membrane surface and they are transformed into OH radicals, a powerfully active but unstable material, which robs the harmful substance of a hydrogen atom (H). As a result, they are inactivated by severing the protein on the cell membrane, opening holes. The OH radicals instantly bond with the removed hydrogen (H), forming water vapor (H2O), and return to the air.Long-living ions spread throughout the entire room.Applying a plasma discharge to the moisture and oxygen in the air generates positive and negative ions. The layer of water molecules that form around each ion ensures that they are long-living. Because these ions are identical to those that occur in nature, safety is assured.

With the BBX online videos, people can access and stream our entire BBX fitness choreography workout library straight to their TV or device from anywhere in the world!



It's not just about losing weight or getting ripped, it's a way for women and men to take control of their health, fitness, confidence, and have a blast while doing it! People want to look forward to their workout, not dread it! They want the time to pass and not even realize they've worked for an hour; because even if they feel like passing out…they were having such a good time, they didn’t want it to stop! That is BBX Fitness!  But many people will never know about BBX because it's not available at their local gym, and even if it was, they may never set foot in a gym. Many women have children and cannot leave the house and some, simply want to practice the routines or workouts from the privacy of their homes. Or many people work long hours or travel for work and are unable to commit to a gym or trainer. 
 With your help, we can fulfill the demand and inspire the masses to get off the couch and sweat, move & groove, completely transforming their bodies with access not to just one or two DVD's...but a FULL library of choreography that they can access online and stream straight to their TV or device!

Every prosthetic foot/leg that he had impeded mobility under a vehicle and they had to be removed when working. It was decided that a round foot was necessary that would allow walking as close as possible to the ground, on the nubs, make getting up and down as effortless as possible while reducing the chance of getting hung up.  This maximizes mobility while reducing stress on the back.  Often children born without legs or children that received amputations when young are able to walk on their nubs, it is unusual for adults that become amputees to be able to do the same.  </p><p><b>How it works</b></p><p>The round design allows for constant ground contact from any position.  Pressure can then be directly applied to the ground without changing position and the amputee can roll up on the round sides.  Since the round shape can grab from nearly any position, it works great on uneven/irregular surfaces and the amputee doesn’t need to focus as much on placement.  If placement is a little off a different part of the foot grabs.  </p><p>This device is not intended to replace full leg or knee prosthetics. It’s meant to increase functionality with specific tasks and provide another option for those who have difficulty using other prosthetics.  </p><p><b><b></b></b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FG-G8XNuYeeo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DG-G8XNuYeeo&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FG-G8XNuYeeo%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p>TASKS DONE IN THE VIDEOS MAY NOT SEEM LIKE MUCH BUT THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO DO IN FULL LEG PROSTHETHESIS.

<p>Overseas orders of Stump Armour will not be completed until Customs regulatory requirements are determined and we are in compliance.  We plan to have this in order in July.  We will take preorders to gauge demand and then move on from there.  </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Worldwide over 1 million amputations are performed yearly.  There are not a lot of prosthetic options for some of them.  A small percentage of the US amputee population will be able to use this affordable foot but we also are exploring international and potential humanitarian applications. This direction may include several variations and accessories that still need to be developed.  </p>
<p>In short:</p>
<p>– Unique product</p>
<p>– Maximizes mobility</p>
<p>– Can minimize back strain</p>
<p>– Individuals having difficulty with traditional prosthetics may be</p>
<p> able to use Stump Armour</p>
<p>– Effective</p>
<p>– <span>Relatively</span> initial low cost and low lifetime cost</p>
<p>– Durable</p>
<p>– Simplistic; there are no moving parts limiting points of failure</p>

------------------- As a double above knee amputee, Travis witnessed a gap in currently mobility solutions. As a Marine & inventor, he's committed to ensuring that every bilateral amputee has access to Stump Armour: an affordable, durable device that can open up more mobility possibilities for amputees and hence improve the their quality of life.  Featured by re3D covering the manufacturing process:  https://re3d.org/made-in-america-3d-printing-prototypes-for-stump-armour-molds/Stump Armour is a working foot 100% made in America.  Designed specifically for bilateral above knee amputees to maximize their mobility close to the ground, it was originally designed for performing mechanic work.  There has been some interest by single amputees, some for climbing.  The device minimizes effort to stand up from any position, to move short distances, reach items on the ground, lift heavy objects, or simply work out.  In some cases it significantly reduces strain on the lower back. SITE VISITORS: WE JUST NEED EVERYONE THAT VISITS THE SITE TO GIVE A BUCK.  THAT WILL ALLOW US TO GIVE AWAY MANY PAIRS STUMP ARMOUR, WE HAVE RAISED ENOUGH TO GIVE 6 PAIRS AWAY SO FAR BUT SEVERAL MORE AMPUTEES ARE WAITING.  WE'VE HAD OVER 4500 VISITS. HOW MUCH DID YOUR LAST BOTTLE OF WATER COST?  Why we need your help: to keep costs low we need $10,000 to pay off a loan for the first production run and have enough left to do a 2nd run, minimum of 25 pairs. Less than 25 in a run costs more.  All contributions will go towards purchasing Stump Armour for amputees that need it.  With your help we can empower amputees and improve their quality of life.A minimum of 10% of profits will be donated to non-profit organizations that have helped this project to include the Gary Sinise Foundation and 100 Entrepreneurs Project after we meet our goal.  DevelopmentThis was created by a combat wounded Marine with bilateral trans-femoral (above knee, AK) amputations.  The development of this foot began while trying to find a better way to do mechanical work on the ground after injury. Every prosthetic foot/leg that he had impeded mobility under a vehicle and they had to be removed when working. It was decided that a round foot was necessary that would allow walking as close as possible to the ground, on the nubs, make getting up and down as effortless as possible while reducing the chance of getting hung up.  This maximizes mobility while reducing stress on the back.  Often children born without legs or children that received amputations when young are able to walk on their nubs, it is unusual for adults that become amputees to be able to do the same.  How it worksThe round design allows for constant ground contact from any position.  Pressure can then be directly applied to the ground without changing position and the amputee can roll up on the round sides.  Since the round shape can grab from nearly any position, it works great on uneven/irregular surfaces and the amputee doesn’t need to focus as much on placement.  If placement is a little off a different part of the foot grabs.  This device is not intended to replace full leg or knee prosthetics. It’s meant to increase functionality with specific tasks and provide another option for those who have difficulty using other prosthetics.  TASKS DONE IN THE VIDEOS MAY NOT SEEM LIKE MUCH BUT THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO DO IN FULL LEG PROSTHETHESIS. OTHER OPTIONS INCLUDE SCOOTING ON YOUR REAR.Check out more videos in the gallery or at youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsObkfi6W6x2B6...From the creator:Vision:I found a solution to a problem I had and I wanted to make it available for others.  As far as cost it is comparatively lower than other options and is durable with no moving parts.  It doesn’t need replacing or repair except for tread, as necessary, so life time cost is extremely low versus any prosthetic device with moving parts.  Stump Armour has now been utilized  in a myriad of tasks to include climbing ladders, climbing/descending steep and rocky trails, changing tires, traversing loose soil on construction sites, forward/backward rolls, flipping logs, climbing piles of lumber, scaling framing in a construction site, and we are always exploring more uses of this multipurpose foot design.Purpose: This is intended to empower other amputees like myself to be more independent with certain tasks and open up more work options.  An amputee in my position in a developing country often do not have many options for work to earn a living.  With Stump Armour, and future projects along the same concept, some amputees may have more fulfilling lives.  What we need and what you get:As said before we are looking for $10,000 in sales.We are selling the first production run of 25 stainless steel pairs funded on a loan from Liftfund.  All prices are introductory. These are already in production scheduled to be ready for shipping in July 2016.   The more money we make the more people we can help. We’re hoping companies will purchase Stump Armour so they can be given away to amputees.  We will display their logo as a sponsor and how many pairs they contributed.   All cash contributions will also go towards purchasing pairs of Stump Armour for those on the waiting list, there are about 10 available at the moment.  (for an amputee to be added to list for free Stump Armour email info@stumparmour.com ) Costs have gone up more than expected but we are striving to keep costs low so individuals with little or no insurance coverage will be able to afford to purchase Stump Armour themselves. There will be special pricing for amputees purchasing Stump Armour on their own when no free pairs are available, after the campaign ends.  We are also considering a co-pay reimbursement program.  We are making a small profit on each pair sold.  Left over profit will go towards purchasing equipment and tools for future developments and production runs. When enough are sold more people will be hired, creating jobs, to get the devices manufactured and out more quickly.  We primarily hire Veterans.  Employees will raise costs but also free up time for new developments. Promotional Perks:

Overseas orders:
Overseas orders of Stump Armour will not be completed until Customs regulatory requirements are determined and we are in compliance.  We plan to have this in order in July.  We will take preorders to gauge demand and then move on from there.  
The Impact
Worldwide over 1 million amputations are performed yearly.  There are not a lot of prosthetic options for some of them.  A small percentage of the US amputee population will be able to use this affordable foot but we also are exploring international and potential humanitarian applications. This direction may include several variations and accessories that still need to be developed.  
In short:
– Unique product
– Maximizes mobility
– Can minimize back strain
– Individuals having difficulty with traditional prosthetics may be
 able to use Stump Armour
– Effective
– Relatively initial low cost and low lifetime cost
– Durable
– Simplistic; there are no moving parts limiting points of failure
–100% designed and constructed in the USA
–SDVOB certification pending
Manufacturing
The main component is casted metal and the cap on the bottom is polyurethane elastomer.  3D printed prototypes were made by re3D.  The Stainless steel version  is investment casted by Surecast in Bernett TX, aluminum is sand casted by AA Foundries in San Antonio TX, molds for wax castings and bronze is investment casted by Stevens Art Foundry in Bulverde TX.  The polyurethane elastomer caps are casted in house. All components are sprayed in Rhino Liner by Blue Collar Truck Outfitters in New Braunfels TX.

<h3>FAQ's</h3>
<p><strong>Q. I can just buy a disposable, plastic toothbrush at the grocery store for $4. Why should I pay more for grin?</strong></p>
<p>A. Yes, grin is more expensive. But it is a superior quality toothbrush. Plus, it comes to you by mail so you'll never have to stand in front of a wall of toothbrushes that all look identical, yet vary a bit in price. That is one of my biggest frustrations as a consumer – too much choice. Do we really need 45 different options for what is basically a throwaway toothbrush? </p>
<p>The second point is that if we as consumers want to be more responsible in what we consume, then unfortunately, we will usually have to pay more. Plastic is incredibly easy to work with and costs little to produce, but it's very, very bad for the planet. I believe that in the future we will be forced (through scarcity of oil, which is what plastic is made of) – to consume fewer yet smarter products. grin is just such a product.</p>
<p><strong>Q. If grin's brush head is made of plastic, how is it better than a plastic toothbrush?</strong></p>
<p>A. To make a toothbrush that is hygienic and Dentist approved, we need to use plastic. grin's brush head will be made out of ABS plastic, which is 100% recyclable. Unfortunately, the nylon bristles are not. So to recycle to brush head people would need to remove the bristles. We understand that this is not a reality for most people, so we worked hard to design a brush head which uses minimal plastic.</p>
<p>In fact, grin's brush head uses 85% less plastic than an ordinary drug store toothbrush. So even if you use a new grin brush head every month for a year, you would still be using less plastic (~42 grams) than 2 regular toothbrushes (~50 grams for 2).</p>
<p>As grin continues to develop, my hope is that we can find plastic that can decompose quickly and is safe for use.</p>
<p><strong>Q. How much will it cost to order brush head replacements?</strong></p>
<p>A. We're hoping to offer replacements for about $5 each including shipping. To keep costs down we will likely mail people replacement brush heads in packs of 3, then send a friendly email reminder on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. </p>
<p>But for users who are gentle on their toothbrushes, we will offer replacement toothbrush heads on an as-needed basis. Just log in and order a 3 pack whenever you need to.</p>

<div style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""font-size: 36px;line-height: 40px;background-color: initial;"">What is kaiRos?</b></div></span></h1>
<p>kaiRos is a community of specialists from the
health sector who are unifying to improve therapeutic methods for those with
executive functioning impairments. Included in this community are
psychiatrists, psychologists, neurologists, life coaches, general
practitioners, massage therapists, learning strategists, and the like. </p><h3>
<br/><b>What is the kaiRos Approach?</b>
</h3>
<p>The kaiRos Approach is an affordable, exceptional,
hands-on, therapeutic method which enables those with executive functioning
impairments to establish essential coping mechanisms. It teaches the client how
to sift through the general noise and confusion of daily life, and helps them
figure out how to eliminate the noise. The kaiRos approach is highly
customizable and is tailored to the individual client, accounting for such
things as personality and behavioural differences, learning and communication
styles, and individual goals.</p>
<p><b>How did the kaiRos Approach come to be?</b></p>
<p>kaiRos founder, Leah Kazmerik, is the pioneer of
the kaiRos Approach. Years of struggling through the healthcare system with
little to no success lead to paralyzing amounts of frustration. She frequently
turned to her journal as a means of working through roadblocks and consistently
found herself writing of a place she wished existed. One particularly trying
experience had Leah venting her frustration to her mentor, Robert Harris, and
lamenting the fact that there was no place which offered the kind of care she
required. It simply did not, and could not, exist. Robert’s response: “Why
can’t there be?” This inspired her to entertain the possibility that it could.
The two then began the process of brainstorming what has come to be known as
the kaiRos Approach.</p>
<blockquote>“I found a way to not get lost in the system.” –
Leah Kazmerik</blockquote>
<p><b>What is different about the kaiRos Approach?</b></p>
<p>Other forms of therapeutic care often have
difficulty manifesting tangible results from theoretical or philosophical
discussions undergone in removed locations. kaiRos uses emerging remedial methods
alongside in-context coaching to help establish practical daily habits through
the use of in-depth intake assessments, expedited appointments with medical
specialists, and one-on-one coaching in-context.</p>
<p><b>Why is the kaiRos Approach necessary?</b></p>
<p>At kaiRos we believe that absolutely everyone is

in-context.</span></p>
</div><p></p></div>","What is kaiRos?
kaiRos is a community of specialists from the
health sector who are unifying to improve therapeutic methods for those with
executive functioning impairments. Included in this community are
psychiatrists, psychologists, neurologists, life coaches, general
practitioners, massage therapists, learning strategists, and the like. 
What is the kaiRos Approach?

The kaiRos Approach is an affordable, exceptional,
hands-on, therapeutic method which enables those with executive functioning
impairments to establish essential coping mechanisms. It teaches the client how
to sift through the general noise and confusion of daily life, and helps them
figure out how to eliminate the noise. The kaiRos approach is highly
customizable and is tailored to the individual client, accounting for such
things as personality and behavioural differences, learning and communication
styles, and individual goals.
How did the kaiRos Approach come to be?
kaiRos founder, Leah Kazmerik, is the pioneer of
the kaiRos Approach. Years of struggling through the healthcare system with
little to no success lead to paralyzing amounts of frustration. She frequently
turned to her journal as a means of working through roadblocks and consistently
found herself writing of a place she wished existed. One particularly trying
experience had Leah venting her frustration to her mentor, Robert Harris, and
lamenting the fact that there was no place which offered the kind of care she
required. It simply did not, and could not, exist. Robert’s response: “Why
can’t there be?” This inspired her to entertain the possibility that it could.
The two then began the process of brainstorming what has come to be known as
the kaiRos Approach.
“I found a way to not get lost in the system.” –
Leah Kazmerik
What is different about the kaiRos Approach?
Other forms of therapeutic care often have
difficulty manifesting tangible results from theoretical or philosophical
discussions undergone in removed locations. kaiRos uses emerging remedial methods
alongside in-context coaching to help establish practical daily habits through
the use of in-depth intake assessments, expedited appointments with medical
specialists, and one-on-one coaching in-context.
Why is the kaiRos Approach necessary?
At kaiRos we believe that absolutely everyone is
born to do something with his or her life. When this purpose is not fulfilled,
or is in some way perceived as impossible to achieve, the result is a deep
brokenness and desolation that no one should have to endure.  Low self-esteem,
challenges to social function, and previous challenges to success decrease likelihood
of receiving successful therapeutic care, particularly for those with executive
functioning impairment. The kaiRos Approach provides hands-on guidance through
the chaos and confusion of the diagnosis and treatment process to ensure
successful results.
How can I partner with kaiRos?
At present our greatest need is funding. Since the
kaiRos Approach is not compatible with the current Alberta Health Services
system most of our process has to be paid out of pocket. Ideally we would raise
enough money to operate fully as well as offer scholarships and stipends for
clients with financial struggles.
We are currently looking for qualified coaches in
order to assist a greater number of people. Prior experience in psychology,
counselling, or coaching is required, as well as a willingness to walk with our
clients through any challenges they may be facing.
We are always interested in networking with
passionate, informed healthcare professionals with whom we can collaborate to
better assist our clients. We are looking for individuals with a history of
success working with clients in various psychological and psychiatric fields,
such as: ADHD, mood disorders, personality disorders, neurodevelopmental
disorders, and learning disabilities. Expert knowledge in the field of improving
executive function is necessary.
When will the kaiRos Approach be available?
We will begin the screening process for the proof
of concept with our clients on June 1, 2016. We are expecting to open our doors
fully shortly thereafter.
How are you spending our money?Based on preliminary forecasts, forty to fifty percent of funds raised will be used to cover administrative costs. The remaining amount will be devoted to covering all coaching costs and assisting clients with financial needs to cover any necessary specialist fees. Because the method has not yet been fully proven, we have endeavoured to assist these clients to ensure their investment does not outweigh their means.Meet our Team

<h3>Do you love dogs?</h3>
<p>We do. If there was a way you could pet a dog right now, would you do it? We would. Imagine that: pull out your phone, find a dog (and their owner) five minutes away who’s ready to let you rub their belly, toss them a frisbee, or just pet them and tell them they are h*ckin' good puppers. As a dog owner, imagine getting a ping - someone starved for a dog's attention is 5 minutes away, and willing to pay to play with your dog (who could use a little more exercise, let’s be honest.) In short, this is a world of ""dogs on demand,"" where owners and seekers win, and pups get all the affection.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If this all sounds like a fantasy, that's because it is...right now. This service does not yet exist, but we have a plan to build it...All we need is a little help.</span></p>
<p>We are Pat, Bob, and Nate; we have been friends since we were kids and have always dreamed of doing something big together. We’ve been doing things together our whole lives. We grew up <strong>together</strong>. We have traveled the world <strong>together</strong>. We have suffered and triumphed <strong>together</strong>. Now we want to try to build something meaningful <strong>together</strong>.</p>
<p>Given our shared history, it only seemed natural that our project would be something that helps make connections. That is how we came up with idea for Pupprrr. We have a vision for an app/ service that will allow people to connect with dogs (and their humans) in their local area.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get - Straight.Up.SWAG. </h3>
<p>To make this dream project a reality, we need to raise around $30k. That funding will help us get operational (target date is May 2018).</p>
<p>But wait, what's in it for you? (besides the best app in the world?) Well, we hate asking people for anything, so we want to offer some unique perks for those who help us out.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i><strong>Founders' Circle</strong></i> <i><strong>($1000 or more)</strong></i> - First off, we have a limited number of vouchers for custom infusions for the high rollers out there. We infused these craft spirits ourselves with recipes Nate has been perfecting over the past year, then we put them in a bottle covered in custom, limited edition artwork designed by Pat.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Yo, I got you ($500) </strong></i>- For those still pretty high rollers, we also have custom art created by Pat that we had printed on aircraft aluminum. We wanted to show you that we are serious about our project so we got serious about creating some art for you. Each one includes a person message from the founders.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Lemme Help! ($100) </strong></i>- We couldn't have an app centered around dogs without some sweet, custom dog tagz...</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Here's My Milk Money ($50)</strong></i> - Every penny we get means the world to us, so we put together these bespoke, personalized thank yous</li>

<p>To get this app off the ground, between the three of us, we have a unique combination of skills and experiences that will help us succeed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bob is Chief Data Scientist at a leading mental health tech company. He is a Columbia-educated statistician, with years of experience in big data, product management, and user experience. He also knows how to build companies from the ground up, he was the first employee at his current company, which has grown to over 70 staff. </li>
<li>Pat comes to the table with honed business acumen, a trained artistic eye, and a wealth of experience in product development. He is a classically trained artist, a successful web developer with experience running his own design company, and a loving dog owner.</li>
<li>Nate adds extensive leadership and project management experience honed in the military, along with legal and business know-how. He is a Harvard-educated lawyer, a management consultant at a top firm, a Naval War College-trained strategist, and the former Captain of a Coast Guard Patrol Boat stationed in Guam. That ship, the Coast Guard Cutter WASHINGTON (WPB-1331) helped save 23 lives in 2013 and earned the distinction of being named the best Coast Guard unit in the Pacific Area.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we have a great plan and have already made significant progress.We have already made extensive progress on our initial design and are engaged in first-round testing on several key elements. We have already maintained an aggressive schedule, and we hope to be moving into coding in January...with a target launch date in May! </p>
<p>Finally, we have each other! We have been through a lot together and, through it all, we have helped each other thrive. We have faith in each other...and we ask that you use that as a foundation to extend some faith to us as a team. </p>

<p>Producing a new line of hair products always has an element of risk: batches can face setbacks due to raw material shortages and machines can malfunction mid-production. DāO has come to realize that setbacks can happen, but having produced a full batch of products with the <strong>Naturel Moisturizing Spray</strong> from start to finish, we’re confident that we’ve ironed out the lion's share of these issues. Anything that we encounter along the way, well that’s always part of the <strong>#DefyAllOdds</strong> journey, but we have a great team and we have no doubt that we’ll be able to deal with it. It’s a step up in our production methods but that’s part of the challenge and why it's worthwhile.</p>
<p>If the campaign really takes off, some of you may have to wait a little longer for your products since we have to order more raw materials and packaging goods and we have a limited production capacity. We’ve tried to be conservative with our timeline and we’ll keep you fully updated along the way and promise that your hair transformation will be well worth the wait.</p>
</div></div>","False divisions have been created and exploited for years in the beauty industry. Hair products that dominate beauty shelves are not formulated for all hair types and textures and often don’t cater to women, men and children.DāO designs and creates premium products using plant based and laboratory made ingredients for the entire family. We do this through an improved supply chain process that reduces overall production costs to provide the highest quality products to our customers at the lowest price.By supporting us, you will help bring our full product line to market and launch a mass #DefyAllOdds advocacy campaign that will help to debunk false beliefs about hair and identity in our global society.In the beginning, DāO started with just Naturel Daily Moisturizing Spray. People love how it works, how it smells and how it enhances their natural look. After many requests and much anticipation, it is with great pride that DāO seeks to manufacture and produce a full hair product line that includes 6 other products: Moisturizing Shampoo, Deep Conditioner, Leave-In Conditioner, Hair Growth Oil, Non-Flake Hair Gel and Scalp Conditioner.This is our first time creating something at this scale, yet it’s a nod to the social side of the Detroit community that we’re in where #DefyAllOdds is a way of life.All of these products are designed and created to be used together in order to experience the full DāO hair transformation and restoration.DāO starts by sourcing the highest quality plant-based and laboratory made ingredients to inspire and create all product formulations. Each product packs unique essential oils that contribute to comprehensive mind, body and hair healing and restoration.DāO partners with a family-owned manufacturer who has been in the haircare business over 100 years. By enforcing strict service level agreements, DāO ensures there is little waste in the production process while the premium quality of the product is maintained.Get Ready to End the Confusion, Frustration and Pain of Caring For Your Natural Hair! It is DāO’s goal to help people understand how to love and nurture their amazing authenticity and #DefyAllOdds.It starts first with the health of your mind and body which directly reflects in your hair. In today’s fast-paced world, we often neglect caring for ourselves and taking time to be still and breathe. Then it takes great products to nurture your delicate hair as it transitions from damaged to healthy or from dry to well-nourished.  Using Naturel Daily Moisturizing Spray will guarantee an immediate shift in your overall hair experience as you find the hair becoming more manageable and restored over time.When seeking to nurture your long-term hair health, be sure to follow the steps below featuring our divine product line up for beautiful hair at every occasion.
 
Own Your Identity and Dare to Be Different
DāO donates 5% of profits to fund the #DefyAllOdds campaign encouraging young and old from all backgrounds to own their identities and embrace the differences that make them unique. The programs will include nationwide workshops, social media engagement, and community meetups. Outcomes are projected to impact community awareness, dialogue, and social capital as it relates to redefining healthy beauty and lifestyle standards.
Our goal is to cultivate diverse communities that are self-loving and committed to supporting each other and working together to accept others just as they are.
 Where does your money go? DāO intends to allocate contributions from this campaign to do the following:
Purchase high-quality ingredients, sustainable packaging, and other product materials
Fund the manufacturing, production, fulfillment and shipment of the full DāO product line 
Cover costs associated with marketing, administrative supplies and service fees.

<h3>Why I started Tribe</h3>
<p>I was not prepared for life as a mom. Then again, who really is? I felt it all – the unexplainable joy mixed with the overwhelming “what did we do?!” sentiment. I know I’m not alone. Most moms go through some form of baby blues: anxiety, loneliness, depression, sleep deprivation, stress, fear, and loss of identity. How on earth can something be so amazing and special, yet so chaotic and confusing? This emotional roller coaster leaves us feeling like we’re on an island, but the truth is, nearly every mom can relate.</p>
<p>There is no shame in this honesty, but most of us don’t talk about it. It’s our tendency to share the happy moments – the picture-perfect moments – but we’re less inclined to simply say, “today is really, really hard.” Personally, I feel drained by the exhaustion. I feel like I need more support and more “me time.” I desire a time when I felt like I was in control of my life. Oh, and I miss my relationship with my husband.</p>
<p>Life will never be the same, though. From the moment we became pregnant, everything changed: mind, body, and spirit. Our identity shifted, and even if this new, 2.0 version of ourselves is better, we have to acknowledge and embrace that life has changed. We have changed.</p>
<p>Motherhood is more than a full-time gig, and generally, we respond to it by putting ourselves last. We give so much of ourselves away immediately. This role requires brain power, muscle, every inch of our heart, and every minute of our day. So, here is my challenge for you, mamas: take care of your mind, body, and spirit.</p>
<h2>Our Next Steps</h2>
<p>Tribe is moving into an amazing new home! We are sharing a space with an existing 16,000 square foot gym with studio space,  gym equipment, an indoor pool + hot tub, sauna/steam, body work rooms, locker room, and childcare. </p>
<p>Two elements that are vital to Tribe's success are having a dedicated <strong>Tribe Ladies Lounge</strong> within the 16,000 gym for our women to congregate before and after classes, and having a top notch <strong>childcare studio</strong>. And due to us sharing space, being able to add a bit of the Tribe brand and vibe to the large space so that our women feel comfortable and welcome is also a necessity. We need to put resources into these areas to make sure they happen.</p>
<p>Additionally, we want to make joining Tribe even more special with a <strong>welcome gift</strong> full of educational tools, resources, helpful tips, and Tribe swag.</p>
<p>At this time, we want to add afternoon <strong>workshops and gatherings</strong>. We plan on having a time dedicated to ""sacred space,"" where women can just be together and talk about what is happening in their lives. We also plan on working with professionals in this field to offer themed workshops and seminars. </p>
<p>Lastly, we need <strong>support staff</strong>! Just as how we preach that it takes a village to raise a child, we need extra hands to support Tribe.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our goal is to raise $20,000</h3>
<p>With your donation, we will be able to build out our <strong>childcare studio</strong> with the highest quality equipment and toys; purchase furniture for our <strong>Tribe Ladies Lounge</strong>; hire additional <strong>support staff</strong>; design, print, and buy items for our <strong>welcome bags</strong>; and to test <strong>workshops and seminars</strong>.</p>
<p>Funds will be spent in order listed above.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>At Tribe, magic is happening. In the studio, we hear from women daily about the difference we have made in their lives, how they have made friends, how they don't feel so lonely, how they feel healthier and happier than they have in years, how their postpartum symptoms have disappeared. And when you have healthy and happy mothers, you have healthy and happy children. We also hear from women around the country that keep an eye on what Tribe is up to through our blog and social media platforms. Even from across the country, we are making a difference in their lives. Most recently we received an email from a woman in Brooklyn: ""I just read your ""about"" section on your website and was left in tears. Tears of relief that I can now trust that I'll find community in a new city where I only know one other family. Becoming a mother has indeed been the most incredible and isolating experience of my life and we are about to undergo a huge upheaval by moving to a city that we believe will offer a better life for our little one. So thank you for creating Tribe. I cannot wait to be a part of it!""</p>

Your contributions will help us fly our founder Sohrab Amiri on the ground and pay for expenses related to his stay for 2 months to work with developers and health facilities. In total, we have raised $1,030 and for that, we are incredibly thankful to those who have shown support and trust into our Cumasu team to fulfill this project. </strong></p><p><strong>However, we still are in need of funding to ensure that </strong><strong>Cumasu</strong><strong> can run its Pilot Project in order to see how best we can work with health facilities and patients to serve them with the necessities to ensure an improved adherence of appointments and prescription intake for sensitive diseases such as HIV/AIDS. We will include the link to our first round of the sincere support we have received to our pilot project efforts thus far. </strong></p><p><strong>The description of the previous campaign will help demonstrate what will happen with the funding we have raised thus far. </strong></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>Imagine your name is Maureen from Nairobi, Kenya, working as a hairdresser. You are the only breadwinner for your parents and siblings sometimes working 15 hours a day. You start catching a cold that you cannot seem to shake off, your vision starts to blur, and you are losing a significant amount of weight over time. Despite knowing how important your vision is for your work, you ignore the symptoms. The stigma around it limits your access to diagnosis and treatment. </p><p>Finally, after your sister was able to convince you, you went to a local hospital and got tested for HIV. You are HIV positive. How could this have happened to you?</p><p>After a while, the untreated HIV made you blind and you could no longer work because of how long you had to wait to seek diagnosis and treatment due to fear of the stigma around it. Now you are 34 with no partner or children, and you have been contemplating suicide. </p><p>Maureen's story is the embodiment of many more people in which HIV/AIDS has left people in unstable positions within society, ultimately killing them prematurely. According to Avert, there are 4,500 new HIV infections every day among adults 15 years and older. 37% of those infections are among young people (aged 15-24 years), and this is an even worse statistic when we find out that women in the same age group have a higher HIV prevalence than men in the same age group.</p><p>My story begins with my parents fleeing to Germany as political refugees. Racism left me ostracized at a young age. From those experiences, questions related to social stigma have been a part of me ever since I can remember.

Your contributions will help us fly our founder Sohrab Amiri on the ground and pay for expenses related to his stay for 2 months to work with developers and health facilities. In total, we have raised $1,030 and for that, we are incredibly thankful to those who have shown support and trust into our Cumasu team to fulfill this project. However, we still are in need of funding to ensure that Cumasu can run its Pilot Project in order to see how best we can work with health facilities and patients to serve them with the necessities to ensure an improved adherence of appointments and prescription intake for sensitive diseases such as HIV/AIDS. We will include the link to our first round of the sincere support we have received to our pilot project efforts thus far. The description of the previous campaign will help demonstrate what will happen with the funding we have raised thus far. IntroductionImagine your name is Maureen from Nairobi, Kenya, working as a hairdresser. You are the only breadwinner for your parents and siblings sometimes working 15 hours a day. You start catching a cold that you cannot seem to shake off, your vision starts to blur, and you are losing a significant amount of weight over time. Despite knowing how important your vision is for your work, you ignore the symptoms. The stigma around it limits your access to diagnosis and treatment. Finally, after your sister was able to convince you, you went to a local hospital and got tested for HIV. You are HIV positive. How could this have happened to you?After a while, the untreated HIV made you blind and you could no longer work because of how long you had to wait to seek diagnosis and treatment due to fear of the stigma around it. Now you are 34 with no partner or children, and you have been contemplating suicide. Maureen's story is the embodiment of many more people in which HIV/AIDS has left people in unstable positions within society, ultimately killing them prematurely. According to Avert, there are 4,500 new HIV infections every day among adults 15 years and older. 37% of those infections are among young people (aged 15-24 years), and this is an even worse statistic when we find out that women in the same age group have a higher HIV prevalence than men in the same age group.My story begins with my parents fleeing to Germany as political refugees. Racism left me ostracized at a young age. From those experiences, questions related to social stigma have been a part of me ever since I can remember. And they have, in part, led me to start my venture, Cumasu, which seeks to address the lack of access to healthcare faced by marginalized communities in developing nations. Specific challenges include lack of privacy, social instability, and a general social stigma governing sexual behavior. We seek to create a new normal in which there is easy access to clinics for sexual health-related diagnoses and support, maintaining patient dignity in the process.Through an appointment-scheduling platform using USSD technology along with an SMS component, we are providing access to diagnosis and treatment, as well as, allowing clinics the opportunity to provide psychosocial support to improve appointment and prescription adherence all via a mobile device as mobile penetration is over 90% in 2016. Through this, Cumasu came to the conclusion that we envision a world in which every human including marginalized communities receive access to proper healthcare as dignified participants through the leveraging of technology and collaboration to tackle the stigma around sensitive diseases, and ultimately connect care providers with those in need of care.Primary Assets:Startup Experience - Sohrab Co-founded Bean Voyage in 2015 to empower women coffee farmers in Costa Rica to enhance their income by 300% via an e-commerce platform. Education - Sohrab majored in Linguistics, as well as, in Business and Non-profit Management at Earlham College which has aided him in adapting to other cultures through a lens of language.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>OVERVIEW</u></h2>
<h3>What do we want to make?</h3>
<p>We are making a free phone app and web platform (computer) that will help you manage your symptoms and quickly figure out what works best for you in improving your condition.</p>
<p>For details on how exactly the app will help you accomplish this, check out the features section below.</p>
<h3>Why are we crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>For a project of this magnitude, we need our team to be engaged full-time - especially the software engineers. We are gathering funds from the community to pay for our basic living expenses and the wages of any engineers we bring onto the team.</p>
<p>For details on how we plan to utilize the money, as well as the rewards you’ll receive for contributing, see the section titled “How your donation helps” and “Perks” below.</p>
<h3>Before you read on:</h3>
<p>The images used are not taken from the actual app. They are mock-ups we’ve created in order to convey our vision. With your help, they can become reality. Without it, they’ll remain mock-ups for longer. <br/><br/>If you have questions that aren't addressed in the FAQ section below, feel free to message us through Indiegogo or email us directly at contact@joinaics.com</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>FEATURES</u></h2>
<h3>Tracking</h3>
<p>We believe that in order to make progress, you need a clear picture of your health. Thus we begin by enabling you to easily keep track of how you’re feeling, what medications/supplements you’re taking, treatments you’re trying, etc. Here’s an example where a user has just finished eating, so she wants to record her post-meal fatigue, temperature, and mood.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478678983/smqtepymufrdxmkwbwxm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Visualizing</h3>
<p>So you’ve kept track of your health for a few weeks, aren’t you curious to see how it changed during that time? Using the AICS app, you’ll be able to SEE it. It’s hard to view the big picture when you’re using journals or spreadsheets (or not tracking at all!!), so we’re going to make it easy to study your data visually. You’ll be able to quickly find answer to questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much did my energy increase when I removed dairy from my diet?</li>
<li>I feel like my joints hurt more when my temperature is low. Is there a correlation here?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example of a user who is studying the relationship between her Thyroid Panel values, mental clarity and energy over the course of a year. Interesting….</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Aggregating Data</h3>
<p>As more people use our app, we’ll be able to gather their information and turn it into a resource. That means your efforts can help someone else figure out their health! By leveraging not only your health data, but the data of the entire community, we’ll provide you with insights and answers you would have spent weeks or months searching for before.</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s working well for others with similar symptoms?</li>
<li>I’m undiagnosed, do my symptoms match with a lot of people who have Hashimoto’s?</li>
</ul>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Group Experiments</h3>
<p>You want to try a magnesium protocol? So do hundreds of other people! By participating in a group experiment, you can compare your progress with others trying it with you. This will also help practitioners better understand treatments and make improvements to their protocols. When you join an experiment, we’ll make it very easy to understand what treatments you should take, what you need to track, and what sort of science is taking place behind the experiment.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Practitioners</h3>
<p>If you’ve ever wished to find the right doctor, one that listens to you and never asserts that it’s in your head, here’s a solution. There are many practitioners who specialize in autoimmune disease and chronic illness management, and they want to connect with you too. Looking for a nutritionist specializing in IBS? An endocrinologist with Hashimoto’s experience? Filter your search and find the practitioner that best fits you!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>How your Donation Helps</u></h2>
<p>We set our flexible goal of $100,000 based on our hiring, equipment, and infrastructure needs. Everything we receive will go directly towards developing our platform. The more resources that we have, the faster we’ll be able to make that vision a reality.</p>
<p>Donations go toward: basic living expenses, hiring software engineers, equipment and infrastructure needs (development laptops and hosting services)</p> <h3>Perks</h3>
<p>Our primary perk is Early Access. With early access, you'll be able to use the app before it is publicly released.</p>

<p>Your data is completely anonymous and private. No one can see your individual data but you and those you may choose to work with (a doctor, for example).</p>
<h3>If everybody’s data is private, how do you gather community data?</h3>
<p>Individual data will be aggregated anonymously. That means that we will take data that you put in, dissociate it from you as an individual, group it with everyone else’s data, and then only statistics will be publicly visible. That means when you look at community information, you’ll see patterns and correlations you are interested in, but no individual data.</p>
<p>If you don’t feel comfortable with us including your anonymized data in the aggregation, you can always opt out while continuing to use our other features.</p>
<h3>I’m a doctor/dietitian/health coach and think that AICS would be really useful for me to work with patients/clients. How would this work in my practice?</h3>
<p>Put simply, if you ask patients to keep journals or spreadsheets, or ask them how they’ve been feeling between visits, this app will be useful to you.</p>
<p>We want for doctors to be able to quickly understand a patient’s daily experience over the course of weeks/months. The app will save you time and give you detailed scientific data on their symptoms, environmental inputs, treatments, etc.</p>
<p>Being featured as a practitioner on the platform will also place you and your practice in front of thousands of potential clients who may be interested in working with you!</p>
<h3>How will your app help me on my health journey?</h3>
<p>The app will provide you information. Whether it’s information about yourself or the community, it will be scientific and easy to understand. Plus, your data will do a lot of the work for you! What do we mean?</p>
<p>We’ll help you analyze the data you’ve recorded to see what’s working, we’ll connect you to others in the community with relevant data or experiments, and we’ll direct you to new research applicable to you. It’s all about YOU, but WE do a lot of the work.</p>
<p>Keeping a journal or inputting data into spreadsheets requires lots of time and focus. Our app will keep your interactions quick and easy, allowing you to focus on your life.</p>
<h3>What aspects of my life should/can I track?</h3>
<p>We’ve designed the app so that you can record pretty much anything and everything that comprises your chronic illness experience. Think your fatigue may be related to your diet? Track it! Think selenium supplements will decrease your TPO antibodies? Track it!</p>

</div></div>","OVERVIEW
What do we want to make?
We are making a free phone app and web platform (computer) that will help you manage your symptoms and quickly figure out what works best for you in improving your condition.
For details on how exactly the app will help you accomplish this, check out the features section below.
Why are we crowdfunding?
For a project of this magnitude, we need our team to be engaged full-time - especially the software engineers. We are gathering funds from the community to pay for our basic living expenses and the wages of any engineers we bring onto the team.
For details on how we plan to utilize the money, as well as the rewards you’ll receive for contributing, see the section titled “How your donation helps” and “Perks” below.
Before you read on:
The images used are not taken from the actual app. They are mock-ups we’ve created in order to convey our vision. With your help, they can become reality. Without it, they’ll remain mock-ups for longer. If you have questions that aren't addressed in the FAQ section below, feel free to message us through Indiegogo or email us directly at contact@joinaics.com
 
FEATURES
Tracking
We believe that in order to make progress, you need a clear picture of your health. Thus we begin by enabling you to easily keep track of how you’re feeling, what medications/supplements you’re taking, treatments you’re trying, etc. Here’s an example where a user has just finished eating, so she wants to record her post-meal fatigue, temperature, and mood.

 
Visualizing
So you’ve kept track of your health for a few weeks, aren’t you curious to see how it changed during that time? Using the AICS app, you’ll be able to SEE it. It’s hard to view the big picture when you’re using journals or spreadsheets (or not tracking at all!!), so we’re going to make it easy to study your data visually. You’ll be able to quickly find answer to questions like:

How much did my energy increase when I removed dairy from my diet?
I feel like my joints hurt more when my temperature is low. Is there a correlation here?

Here’s an example of a user who is studying the relationship between her Thyroid Panel values, mental clarity and energy over the course of a year. Interesting….

 
Aggregating Data
As more people use our app, we’ll be able to gather their information and turn it into a resource. That means your efforts can help someone else figure out their health! By leveraging not only your health data, but the data of the entire community, we’ll provide you with insights and answers you would have spent weeks or months searching for before.

What’s working well for others with similar symptoms?
I’m undiagnosed, do my symptoms match with a lot of people who have Hashimoto’s?


 
 
Group Experiments
You want to try a magnesium protocol? So do hundreds of other people! By participating in a group experiment, you can compare your progress with others trying it with you. This will also help practitioners better understand treatments and make improvements to their protocols. When you join an experiment, we’ll make it very easy to understand what treatments you should take, what you need to track, and what sort of science is taking place behind the experiment.

 

Practitioners
If you’ve ever wished to find the right doctor, one that listens to you and never asserts that it’s in your head, here’s a solution. There are many practitioners who specialize in autoimmune disease and chronic illness management, and they want to connect with you too. Looking for a nutritionist specializing in IBS? An endocrinologist with Hashimoto’s experience? Filter your search and find the practitioner that best fits you!

 
How your Donation Helps
We set our flexible goal of $100,000 based on our hiring, equipment, and infrastructure needs. Everything we receive will go directly towards developing our platform. The more resources that we have, the faster we’ll be able to make that vision a reality.
Donations go toward: basic living expenses, hiring software engineers, equipment and infrastructure needs (development laptops and hosting services) Perks
Our primary perk is Early Access. With early access, you'll be able to use the app before it is publicly released.

In order to focus on the project full-time, the team quit their jobs. After working on it part-time for months, we decided to dive in head-first to make this vision a reality. Our release date is dependent on funding - we anticipate the first early release of the app to be around February.

<p>  My name is Matt Oyler and I have been involved with athletics my entire life. I started doing martial arts at age 5, and by age 8 I started playing recreation football.  This path continued as I began coaching, became a certified personal trainer, and even had an amateur mixed martial arts bout at a near by casino.  I took to athletics so naturally, and whenever  things got hard in my life or I started to doubt myself, I could always turn to athletics to help me gain some sort of perspective about life. Sports and athletics have gotten me through so many difficult times. In order to pay it forward I wanted to give back to the sports community, by bringing all of my experiences into one website that might be able to help others the way it helped me. By contributing to this campaign you can help me give the most positive experience to athletes involved in our program. Funds will go directly to maintenance of the site and to the amazing team I have supporting me, in making my dream a reality. They have given up time with their families, and sacrificed so much of their personal lives because of a belief in me and what I am trying to accomplish. </p>
<p>    My goal is to raise $300,000. We know this is a lofty goal, but here at UBC we reach for the stars. This would cover yearly salaries for my entire team, upgrades and maintenance for the site, and marketing to get our message out there. If I weren’t to raise all of the money, I would take what I did make and still take care of my team. I believe in them and their talents. If they are with me, I can make this site a success. (I have posted a youtube video in the gallery section of this campaign page to better explain exactly where the funds will be allocated.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I believe in this project because it is designed to give back. My goal was to add as much value to these athletes as possible, while asking very little in return. I wanted athletes and parents of athletes to feel someone is finally looking out for them. I set my price for membership at $5 a month because I believe in giving every one an equal opportunity to achieve greatness. For the price of a Big Mac combo, they can have access to top notch training methods and mental exercises that are designed to build athletic skills and self confidence. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>     When I was a young coach years ago, I began coaching football at the Jr. High school I played at. When I was playing there, our team was terrible, and winning records were not synonymous with our school. The lessons I learned though, how to pick myself back up, try my hardest, believe in myself, love my teammates even through the hard times, were lessons that made me the man I am today. So when I had an opportunity to go back as a coach, I swore to myself I would give that team every thing I had.  During our summer break I decided to develop a workout program for the athletes. Three times a week all summer long the boys would wake up at 7:00 to meet me on the field for conditioning and drills. Then we would make our way up to the weight room to workout. The boys quickly developed a mentality of this is just what we do at this school. We work harder and put in more time than anyone else does. By my third year at that school we celebrated our first championship. Not our first championship as a coaching staff, but the school's first championship ever. All of the credit does not go to me and my summer program, as we had an amazing coaching staff, but there is something to be said about teams spending many hours together, training and building that mentality of this is just what we do. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’ve seen so many sites almost do what My Team Trainer is trying to accomplish. The thing is, I have dedicated my entire life to athletics. From being a player myself , to coaching, to training and motivating; this is all I have ever known. I know the problems and hurdles each and every person involved with any sport has to overcome, and I believe I have a great solution. </p>
<p>Please help me share my message. Please help me grow this program to reach all athletes. Everyone deserves an equal opportunity to achieve his or her best. Our programs here at My Team Trainer can help them do that. You can help us make this a success. You can help others achieve their dreams. Thank you.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Renegade Running is a retail store and community of runners in Oakland, California, opening March 2020. Combining a curated collection of running shoes and apparel with training support and community programming, we strive to make running an inclusive experience for all across race, age, gender, and physical ability. </p>
<p>Our store will offer a curated line of high quality fashion-forward, technical activewear brands, as well as the latest running shoes, apparel, accessories, and nutrition. The store will also be a hub for a diverse running crew and catalyst for other community programs that encourages the athlete in everyone.</p>
<p>Let’s run together.</p>
<h3>Why we're here</h3>
<p>As two founders of color with backgrounds in competitive running, public education, and coaching, we're merging our passions to create a running community rooted in support, diversity, and big goals.  </p>
<p>We're Oakland residents through and through. We witness the heart and passion that courses through the city’s veins. As one of the most ethnically diverse major cities in the country we have seen how communities grow closer and stronger together.</p>
<p>Renegade Running is inspired by the origins of the ‘revolutionary spirit’ in Oakland. We are reclaiming the ‘renegade’ name to challenge the assumptions of what a runner is and can be. Renegades show up despite the hardships and challenges they face inside and outside of the sport.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're getting ready for the grand opening of our brick-and-mortar store at 45 Grand Avenue in March! Before we open, we invite you to join our Founders Crew as one of the first members of our community. Depending on which perk you choose, you'll receive our first- and limited-edition gear, or your choice of membership access to our Runner's Lounge. All Founders Crew members will be invited to a sneak peek event and meet-and-greet before our public opening, too. </p>
<h3>The Runner's Lounge</h3>
<p>We'll stock the best running gear for your athletic journey, AND we know that it's all the little things that keep runners healthy. Our Runner's Lounge will be open before and after store hours for Lounge Members only, and will be stocked with free recovery tools (foam rollers, bands and balls, TRX, and Theragun), nutritional products, and 1:1 support. Lounge members at the Silver and Gold levels can also receive discounted or free access to Normatec recovery boots, an anti-gravity treadmill, and other high-tech tools to keep you running (or recovering) at your best.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When you join our Founders Crew, you're officially part of the Renegade community from day one. You'll also be helping us get to the starting line with a ton of excitement and momentum, as well as supporting our future community initiatives. With a focus on inclusivity, we want to support local middle and high school cross-country programs, offer free child care for single parents on our weekly runs, and handout free nutrition at our pop-ups on running routes in the city. Our goal is to become a leading voice for representation in the running world while also educating members of the benefits of running on the roads and trails. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know the challenges small retail stores face against the ""big box"" or online competitors. We know that new and small businesses can always struggle to make ends meet. But we believe that the core of the Renegade spirit is community, and that a diverse community (you!) will be our greatest added value. We're excited to meet the challenge of investing in the human capital necessary to succeed as a business and resource.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

We're Oakland residents through and through. We witness the heart and passion that courses through the city’s veins. As one of the most ethnically diverse major cities in the country we have seen how communities grow closer and stronger together.
Renegade Running is inspired by the origins of the ‘revolutionary spirit’ in Oakland. We are reclaiming the ‘renegade’ name to challenge the assumptions of what a runner is and can be. Renegades show up despite the hardships and challenges they face inside and outside of the sport.

What We Need & What You Get
We're getting ready for the grand opening of our brick-and-mortar store at 45 Grand Avenue in March! Before we open, we invite you to join our Founders Crew as one of the first members of our community. Depending on which perk you choose, you'll receive our first- and limited-edition gear, or your choice of membership access to our Runner's Lounge. All Founders Crew members will be invited to a sneak peek event and meet-and-greet before our public opening, too. 
The Runner's Lounge
We'll stock the best running gear for your athletic journey, AND we know that it's all the little things that keep runners healthy. Our Runner's Lounge will be open before and after store hours for Lounge Members only, and will be stocked with free recovery tools (foam rollers, bands and balls, TRX, and Theragun), nutritional products, and 1:1 support. Lounge members at the Silver and Gold levels can also receive discounted or free access to Normatec recovery boots, an anti-gravity treadmill, and other high-tech tools to keep you running (or recovering) at your best.

The Impact
When you join our Founders Crew, you're officially part of the Renegade community from day one. You'll also be helping us get to the starting line with a ton of excitement and momentum, as well as supporting our future community initiatives. With a focus on inclusivity, we want to support local middle and high school cross-country programs, offer free child care for single parents on our weekly runs, and handout free nutrition at our pop-ups on running routes in the city. Our goal is to become a leading voice for representation in the running world while also educating members of the benefits of running on the roads and trails. 

Risks & Challenges
We know the challenges small retail stores face against the ""big box"" or online competitors. We know that new and small businesses can always struggle to make ends meet. But we believe that the core of the Renegade spirit is community, and that a diverse community (you!) will be our greatest added value. We're excited to meet the challenge of investing in the human capital necessary to succeed as a business and resource.

<p>22 years ago I suffered an injury climbing a mountain in South Korea. My life changed there and then. It took 71/2 hours to hike up, and over 22 hours to crawl down. The pain in my knees were blinding, and every step was torture. My life was never the same. I spent the next 20 years searching for a solution. Year after year things just got worse. I couldn't sit in a movie theater without my knees killing me. Flying on a plane was excruciating. As I got closer and closer to 50 years of age, I started to worry about if I would be able to walk in my later years! It got so bad that on one particular instance, I jumped off the sidewalk and onto the street (what 4-6 inches) and I thought my legs were going to collapse!</p>
<p>That was the lowest point in my pain journey, but the story has a happy ending. After years of searching and trying all kinds of different treatment methods, I found a solution that worked, Fascial Contouring.</p>

<p>My twenties were largely spent as a mountain guide and outdoor athlete. I completed several remote expeditions, and served as a wilderness first aid instructor in the Arctic and for the Canadian military. Eventually I started to notice that my body was in constant pain, especially in my knees, hips and low back. I needed to find answers otherwise my fate was tied to being put on long surgical wait lists, without guarantee of successful outcomes. </p>
<p>Now in my mid-thirties, I am pain free and more mobile than in my twenties. I even placed on the podium at the National Championships for Ninja warrior obstacle course racing.   </p>
<p>After over a decade of learning about Fascia and its relationship to pain and movement, many years of effort went into founding and developing these comprehensive manual therapy and movement programs at IMfit Health Innovations. It is now  a pleasure to introduce this bite-sized version of all our efforts to you via Fascial Self Release (FSR) and the PainPal App.</p>

<p>As a former professional and current extreme sport athlete, I've had my fair share of testing the body and a have had a host of injuries and challenges; from hitting a concrete wall in a formula car race at 9 x gravity to crashing in the Panamanian jungle on a skydiving stunt.</p>
<p>5 years ago I was introduced to my partners Phil and Stephan and their Fascial Contouring and Intentional Movement systems. I've seen the systems evolve into what it is today, through me any many other clients. Now at 38 yrs, my structure and body functions are similar to where I was more than a decade ago.  </p>
<p>Two years ago I invested in an extended research and development stage and offered my skillsets to add onto and create IMfit with Phil and Stephan. Taking these systems to the next level; into the advanced Bio-Hacking realm, here we created modalities no one had seen before and with such massive success and evolutionary change in ourselves and clients. </p>
<p>As an adventurer I've spent much time around the world, deep in competition and on the edge of cliffs facing down into the abyss. As a former professional race car driver, I've had the opportunity to work with world class teachers and learning coaches to really test my self and dial in specific ways to retain information and create change. Gaining experience and training around the world in some very challenging environments has taught me a lot of skill sets in understanding the human psyche in specific ways; fear, emotional patterns and brain states.</p>
<p>Choosing to engage in these challenges came with many emotional challenges, injuries, dysfunctional patterns and traumas; all of which are translated into knowledge and functionality under what we have been able to develop and share with you here.</p>
<p>Bringing these skill sets and experience, and accompanied by current science, we have worked with developers to create an A.I. system that learns with you, from you, to create specific ways to teach retention learned programs and redefine how our bodies communicate with pain.  I'm very excited to have your support and take this journey with us. Thank you.</p>

That was the lowest point in my pain journey, but the story has a happy ending. After years of searching and trying all kinds of different treatment methods, I found a solution that worked, Fascial Contouring.
I want to introduce you to the future of pain relief and long term change, PAINPAL!""

Stephan Guenette - Creator and Lead Facilitator

My twenties were largely spent as a mountain guide and outdoor athlete. I completed several remote expeditions, and served as a wilderness first aid instructor in the Arctic and for the Canadian military. Eventually I started to notice that my body was in constant pain, especially in my knees, hips and low back. I needed to find answers otherwise my fate was tied to being put on long surgical wait lists, without guarantee of successful outcomes. 
Now in my mid-thirties, I am pain free and more mobile than in my twenties. I even placed on the podium at the National Championships for Ninja warrior obstacle course racing.   
After over a decade of learning about Fascia and its relationship to pain and movement, many years of effort went into founding and developing these comprehensive manual therapy and movement programs at IMfit Health Innovations. It is now  a pleasure to introduce this bite-sized version of all our efforts to you via Fascial Self Release (FSR) and the PainPal App.


Ryan Verra - Creator and Visionary 

As a former professional and current extreme sport athlete, I've had my fair share of testing the body and a have had a host of injuries and challenges; from hitting a concrete wall in a formula car race at 9 x gravity to crashing in the Panamanian jungle on a skydiving stunt.
5 years ago I was introduced to my partners Phil and Stephan and their Fascial Contouring and Intentional Movement systems. I've seen the systems evolve into what it is today, through me any many other clients. Now at 38 yrs, my structure and body functions are similar to where I was more than a decade ago.  
Two years ago I invested in an extended research and development stage and offered my skillsets to add onto and create IMfit with Phil and Stephan. Taking these systems to the next level; into the advanced Bio-Hacking realm, here we created modalities no one had seen before and with such massive success and evolutionary change in ourselves and clients. 
As an adventurer I've spent much time around the world, deep in competition and on the edge of cliffs facing down into the abyss. As a former professional race car driver, I've had the opportunity to work with world class teachers and learning coaches to really test my self and dial in specific ways to retain information and create change. Gaining experience and training around the world in some very challenging environments has taught me a lot of skill sets in understanding the human psyche in specific ways; fear, emotional patterns and brain states.
Choosing to engage in these challenges came with many emotional challenges, injuries, dysfunctional patterns and traumas; all of which are translated into knowledge and functionality under what we have been able to develop and share with you here.
Bringing these skill sets and experience, and accompanied by current science, we have worked with developers to create an A.I. system that learns with you, from you, to create specific ways to teach retention learned programs and redefine how our bodies communicate with pain.  I'm very excited to have your support and take this journey with us. Thank you.",25.0,7,"1 Campaign

<h3><b>How Sombra Came To Light:</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span><span>One night, I was cruising the bicycle lanes in central London, when another cyclist flew by me.  He had one of those blinking, bright-red taillights, and in the dark it played some nasty tricks on my eyes. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The light was so intense that even as the cyclist pushed further away, I kept feeling disoriented.  With cars on my right and the sidewalk to my left, I was forced to stop so I would avoid diving head first into the curb.</span></span>Needless to say I was annoyed, but my annoyance quickly turned to irony when I realized I had the exact same type of taillight, and that I was probably annoying other cyclists too.</p>
<p>The next day, I went online to look for an alternative, non-blinding taillight. However, all I could find were lousy, cheap-looking things that could barely be seen from ten meters away.  I admit, I would rather blind someone than have them not see me at all.</p>
<p>That evening, before going to bed, I turned my reading lamp on to catch up on some reading, and then it hit me.  A lampshade! Not only will it eliminate the blinding effect of my taillight, it will also make others see me from directions they never could before!</p>
<p>Months and hundreds of iterations later, this ""lampshade"" turned from an idea to a product I now call Sombra, which I will make generally available as soon as this campaign meets its goal. </p>

</div></div>","Why We Need Your Help:Sombra is ready for production, and we are fundraising to pay for a die-cut, silk-screens and to order a bunch of Polypropylene sheets to make the first production run. We need $3000 to make this happen. 

Why You Should Get a Sombra:
Here is why you should own a Sombra and consider contributing to this campaign:



Sombra will keep you safe, by making you visible from all directions.


Sombra will look awesome on any bike, city or mountain


Sombra is so easy to install, you can do it in the dark


Sombra will make you a friendly cyclist, to other cyclists as well as car drivers


Sombra is made of natural Polypropylene, it's 100% recyclable


Sombra will be locally made and we will ship it worldwide for free





 


How Sombra Came To Light:

One night, I was cruising the bicycle lanes in central London, when another cyclist flew by me.  He had one of those blinking, bright-red taillights, and in the dark it played some nasty tricks on my eyes. 
The light was so intense that even as the cyclist pushed further away, I kept feeling disoriented.  With cars on my right and the sidewalk to my left, I was forced to stop so I would avoid diving head first into the curb.Needless to say I was annoyed, but my annoyance quickly turned to irony when I realized I had the exact same type of taillight, and that I was probably annoying other cyclists too.
The next day, I went online to look for an alternative, non-blinding taillight. However, all I could find were lousy, cheap-looking things that could barely be seen from ten meters away.  I admit, I would rather blind someone than have them not see me at all.
That evening, before going to bed, I turned my reading lamp on to catch up on some reading, and then it hit me.  A lampshade! Not only will it eliminate the blinding effect of my taillight, it will also make others see me from directions they never could before!
Months and hundreds of iterations later, this ""lampshade"" turned from an idea to a product I now call Sombra, which I will make generally available as soon as this campaign meets its goal. 





Technical Information:
Please note, Sombra is a tail-light diffuser and requires an existing tail-light (not included). Please read below to make sure Sombra fits your bicycle and tail-light.





Sombra fits most bicycle seat-post clamps provided by top brands like Specialized, Trek, Giant, Raleigh, Cannondale and others. Sombra cannot be fitted on front bolt or diagonally cut clamps.


Sombra fits popular seat-post mounted tail lights including Mars 4.0, Planet Bike Superflash Turbo, PB Blinky 7, PB Blinky Super Flash, Portland Design Works Red Planet, PB Blinky 5, Cateye Reflex, NiteRider Cherry Bomb, PDW Danger Zone, Cateye Rapid 3, Knog Frog Strobe and Cateye Rapid 5. Sombra does not fit rack, helmet, handlebar or bag mounted lights, or lights that protrude more than 5.5 cm (2 inches) from the seat-post.

<p></p>
<h3>1. About us</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are Hearing Software, a group of people who got together to create WIIM<sup>©</sup> project. From the beginning we wanted to work alongside deaf people, from friends and family with hearing problems who helped us transmitting their real needs and entities, such as associations dedicated to help people with hearing disabilities, have taken part in our project, validating our thesis, advising and suggesting improvements to develop a product that provides real solution in their lives. WIIM<sup>©</sup> is a product that uses technology as a channel to help people with hearing disabilities.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>

<h3>2. Using the Friend Button (SOS)</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The friend button (SOS) is an orange, easily accessible, located on the watch and user can always use it when he-she feels at risk or help is needed. The friend button (SOS) has access to GPS to facilitate location and medical record helping to act quickly and wisely. By using the button, a warning will be sent to the mobile phone registered in our servers (application available on mobile).</p>
<p>There is an option to upgrade and connect to emergency services (only on those countries available).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>3. Is my data stored safely?</h3>

<p>Al instalar WIIM<sup>© </sup> en tu hogar sentirás como los timbres y avisos diarios de tu entorno llegan a tu piel con un suave pero preciso aleteo avisándote si han llamado a la puerta, si está sonando el teléfono, si llora el bebé, o si ya ha acabado la lavadora que pusiste. Además te protege avisándote si detecta la señal de humo, gas, agua u otras situaciones de alerta.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>De forma invisible WIIM</b><b><sup>© </sup></b><b> genera un espacio virtual pero sensorial, donde todas las alertas y avisos activados en su radio de acción se transmiten a la persona con efecto táctil.  </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Con WIIM<sup>© </sup> queremos que descubras cómo es tu día a día con esta nueva manera de vivir el espacio y el sonido.</p>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<div>
<p></p>
<h3>1. ¿Quiénes somos?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Somos Hearing Software, un grupo de personas que se ha unido para dar vida al proyecto WIIM<sup>©</sup>. Desde el principio hemos querido ir de la mano de las personas sordas, desde amigos y familiares con problemas de audición que nos han ido ayudando y transmitiendo sus necesidades reales hasta entidades claves para ellos como las federaciones y confederaciones que han ido escuchando nuestro proyecto, validando nuestras hipótesis, aconsejando y sugiriendo mejoras para desarrollar un producto que aporte solución real en sus vidas. WIIM<sup>©</sup> es nuestra propuesta de valor, un producto que usa la tecnología como canal y la pone al servicio de la comunidad sorda. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<h3>2. ¿Qué incluye el Botón Amigo (SOS)?</h3>
<p>El botón amigo (SOS) es un botón naranja, de fácil acceso, ubicado en el reloj para que la persona lo pueda pulsar siempre que se sienta en peligro o considere que necesita ayuda. Con GPS, para facilitar la localización y con historial médico para actuar rápidamente y con buen criterio. Al pulsarlo llegará un aviso al móvil del familiar o persona de contacto (aplicación disponible en el móvil).</p>
<p>Opcionalmente, se podrá solicitar los servicios de teleasistencia en los países que esté disponible para coordinar familiares y servicios de emergencias.</p>
<br/>

The fluttering of sound




You do not need to search the sound anymore.
The sound flies to you, feel its fluttering. You can disconnect the mind, and trust that your WIIM© Smartwatch works as a second skin to extend your senses.


The places with WIIM© technology use the last advances of wearable products. Your WIIM©Smartwatch absorbs certain hearing signals from the environment and transforms them into vibration.



People with hearing impairments remain sensory connected with their environment when WIIM© technology is added to a place. Their smartwatch detects alerts and  alarms around them which are transformed into sensations for their skin. Spaces with sensory effect.



WIIM© Technology
WIIM© is a new technological product designed by us with care and dedication for the only purpose of making life easier for people with hearing problems.
We aim is to provide you with adequate wellbeing and return the freedom and sense of tranquillity to those who need to control what they cannot hear. 
Turn your home into a place with sensory effect with WIIM© Technology, and let the sound caress you.



After installing WIIM© in your home, you may feel the doorbell and daily notifications from your environment in your skin with a soft and precise fluttering. You will know if your phone is ringing, the baby cries or the  washer already finished. It also protects you by alerting if smoke, gas, water or other situation is detected.

WIIM© creates a virtual and sensory space, where all alerts and alarms activated in its action radius are transmitted with tactile effect to the person.  
We want you discover your daily routine with this new way of  feeling the space and sound.









Transmitters:
1.  Door sensorIt detects if someone knocks the door
2. Appliance sensorIt detects when the appliances have finished
3. Smoke sensorIt detects fire 
4. Gas sensorIt detects toxic, volatile and flammable gases leakage
5. Flood sensor It detects water in not appropriate zones
6. Weather alertIt alerts about natural phenomena (tornadoes, storms, etc.)
And we are working on other integrations which are included in the section of  “Improvements/Goals”.







Friend button (SOS)
If you need help
If you need help you can push the friend button. You do not need to be within the action radius of WIIM©. The friend button is available 24 hours  a day to assist you when you have a difficulty, in any place (home, street, etc.).




* Geolocation data is stored encrypted and can only be accessed in case of emergency.
** Medical data is stored with strong encryption specially HL7 data.




Your contact person is also informed

The contact person registered for your friend button will always be informed about the notifications that you are receiving through the Smartwatch. We have developed this application for them for iOS and Android.




2 houses, just one WIIM©    
The innovative value of WIIM© Technology includes not only its capacity to create a virtual place where the person may receive all alarms, but also its technological umbrella, the internet connection (IoT) and the possibility to share sensors connecting several places to the same system. 


Someone with two or more houses with WIIM© technology will receive all signals automatically activated in each action radius, as the person is in either house. 



Accessible community
And It is important for us that this technology allows to connect us at human levels, since it links public and private (home) places, constructing a more accessible community for everybody, where the minority's needs are also listened by the majority. The creation and connection of places accessible for everyone allow us to be closer.


Those who have WIIM© Smartwatch will receive the alarms and alerts in their houses, offices and leisure places (according to the contracted services) without cost, if these places have the system installed with their action radius in which the watch will be connected.

Companies, Institutions

Reinventing services

The companies, besides the classic safety sensors (water, gas, fire, etc.), may adapt their WIIM services, according to their areas and specific needs, discovering new ways of accessibility.
If your company wants to know the customized services offered by us, contact us and we will be pleased to inform you about all the possibilities.


Accessible Hotel
Ex:  Notification of breakfasts and hotel offers.






WIIM© facilitates its App for people with watches who want to install the service.



SDK for developers


WIIM© facilitates the access through an API Restful, so you can integrate your own sensors. Develop your own applications using WIIM alerts. 
Available from February 2016.


Thematic application
WIIM© also wants to help their clients increase their possibilities of living new spaces and leisure activities. Therefore, we are working on the development of mobile applications that provide enjoyment in the following areas:

Guided tours with videos subtitled in sign language.

Visits to Museums
Research on “text to speech” and “speech to text”, it means, the possiblity of bringing the voice of a call to text and vice versa.



Rewards













Installation at home
The installation at home is simple, without wiring of all wireless elements which can be adapted to the needs of every place. The home kit is constituted by the following elements:

El aleteo del sonido

Ya no es necesario correr en busca del sonido. 


El sonido vuela hasta ti, siente su aleteo. Puedes desconectar la mente, y confiar en que tu WIIM©  Smartwatch funciona como una segunda piel para extender tus sentidos.



Los espacios con la tecnología WIIM©  usan los últimos avances de los productos wearable. Tu WIIM©  Smartwatch absorbe determinadas señales auditivas de tu entorno y las transforma en vibración. 





Cuando a un espacio le sumas la tecnología WIIM© , las personas con problemas de audición permanecen sensorialmente conectadas con su entorno. Su Smartwatch capta avisos y alarmas que suceden a su alrededor y los transforma en sensaciones para su piel. Espacios con efecto sensorial.

WIIM© Technology


WIIM©  es un nuevo producto tecnológico, diseñado por nosotros
con mimo y esmero con el único fin de hacer la vida más fácil a las
personas que tienen problemas de audición.
Nuestro deseo es darles bienestar. Devolver la libertad y la
sensación de tranquilidad a aquellas personas que necesitan
controlar lo que no llegan a escuchar. Por ello creamos espacios
adaptados para todos, en los que el sentido del tacto nos guía y
nos permite movernos, a través del sonido, con autonomía y
flexibilidad.

Convierte tu hogar en un espacio con efecto sensorial con
WIIM© Technology, y déjate acariciar por el sonido. 







Al instalar WIIM©  en tu hogar sentirás como los timbres y avisos diarios de tu entorno llegan a tu piel con un suave pero preciso aleteo avisándote si han llamado a la puerta, si está sonando el teléfono, si llora el bebé, o si ya ha acabado la lavadora que pusiste. Además te protege avisándote si detecta la señal de humo, gas, agua u otras situaciones de alerta.


De forma invisible WIIM©  genera un espacio virtual pero sensorial, donde todas las alertas y avisos activados en su radio de acción se transmiten a la persona con efecto táctil.  


Con WIIM©  queremos que descubras cómo es tu día a día con esta nueva manera de vivir el espacio y el sonido.







Transmisores:
1.  Sensor puertaDetecta si llaman a la puerta
2. Sensor electrodomésticosDetecta el fin de los  electrodomésticos
3. Sensor humoDetecta incendios
4. Sensor gasDetecta fuga de gases tóxicos, volátiles e inflamables
5. Sensor inundaciónDetecta agua en zonas no apropiadas
6. Alerta meteorológicaAviso de fenómenos naturales (tornados, tormentas, etc.)
Y otras integraciones en la que estamos trabajando e incluimos en el apartado de “Mejoras/Metas”.






Botón Amigo (SOS)

Siempre que necesites ayuda
Siempre que necesites ayuda puedes pulsar el botón amigo. No es necesario que estés dentro del área de acción de WIIM© . El botón amigo está disponible 24 horas del día para atenderte cuando sientas dificultad o riesgo, en cualquier lugar (casa, calle, etc.), dentro y fuera del radio de acción.






*Los datos de geolocalización se guardan cifrados y solo se puede acceder a ellos en caso de emergencia.


**Datos médicos son guardados con cifrado de Seguridad Alta para datos médicos HL7.


Tu persona de contacto, también informada

La persona de contacto que hayas puesto para tu botón de amigo estará siempre avisada de las alertas que te llegan a ti a través del Smartwatch. Para ellos hemos desarrollado esta aplicación móvil para iOS y Android.


2 viviendas, 1 solo WIIM© 


El valor innovador de WIIM©  Technology no es solo la capacidad de crear ese espacio virtual donde la persona recibe todas las alertas sino que además su paraguas tecnológico, la conexión a internet (IoT) y la posibilidad de compartir sensores permite que el servicio llegue más lejos generando la posibilidad de conectar varios espacios a un mismo sistema.






Una persona con dos o más viviendas que instale el servicio recibirá automáticamente todas las señales que se activen en cada uno de los radios de acción, según se encuentre en una u otra casa. 



Sociedad accesible 

Y algo importante para nosotros es que esta tecnología nos da la posibilidad de conectarnos a nivel humano ya que une espacios, tanto privados (hogares) como públicos, acercándonos a la idea de construir una sociedad más accesible para todos, donde las necesidades de una minoría sean también escuchadas por la mayoría. La creación y conexión de espacios que sean accesibles para todos nos permite estar más cerca los unos de los otros. (poner en negro)




Aquellas personas que dispongan de WIIM© Smartwatch recibirán los avisos y notificaciones en casa (según servicios contratados) pero también podrán seguir recibiendo avisos en su entorno laboral, en sus zonas de ocio, etc. (sin coste) siempre y cuando estos espacios/establecimientos tengan instalado el sistema con su radio de acción a donde se conectarán sus relojes.


Empresas, Instituciones
Reinventado servicios 

Las empresas, además de los sensores clásicos de seguridad (agua, gas, fuego, etc.), podrán adaptar los servicios de WIIM© según su área temática y necesidades específicas, descubriendo nuevas formas de accesibilidad.

people with wellness solutions. 
Who are we?
We are Wellness and You (WAY). Our team is made up of 10 people
volunteering to launch WAY in April 2015. 
Our values are: 


Wellness
     - Keeping
     wellness and good (healthy, first-rate, excellent) wellbeing at the
     core of all our services.


Accessibility
     - Ensuring
     convenience to our high-quality.


You -
     Always
     focusing and listening to you, what you need, what you like and what you
     don't like.



What do we do?

We
     provide wellness solutions for individuals and workplaces using social,
     environmental and innovative digital products leading to stronger and more
     productive people in life and work.


We
     integrate our services in everyday environments to make the concept of
     wellbeing accessible, enjoyable and in keeping with the fun things in
     life.

Why are we doing it?

We
     are launching WAY because we passionately believe that wellness should be
     accessible for all. From our experience we know there is a lack of
     accessible, engaging solutions available to you at home and in work. We are going to change that.


Your
     support and donations will evolve our work to the next level and ensure we
     can provide services initially in London and then develop them for a
     National audience.





What do we need the money for?


Hackathon
     - We
     will be able to create an interactive website with mobile function
     enabling more people to access our online services.




Product
     Development -
     will allow us to refine our current exciting wellness solutions and pilot them with
     more people.




Marketing
     - will
     allow us to develop our marketing team and interactive events.


With your support we will improve peoples' wellness leading to better
relationships, feeling more productive at work and able to survive city
life. 

Individually, the team have loads of experience of improving wellbeing,
running projects and delivering honest and trustworthy services to make WAY
a success. 
We believe the key to wellbeing is connecting with others and joining us
will allow you to connect with others too!
Other ways you can help.
 We
are really thankful for you taking the time to read this. If you want to go the
extra mile, there are so many ways you can help WAY (pun intended).

     the campaign via social media. Help us reach our target quicker and we’ll
     be able to roll out more services to you that will allow us to lead to improved
     wellness for all.

For the last 7 months , the team spent more time in a toilet than ever trying to find a design that won't  harm the aesthetic of your toilet : 



OUR PROTOTYPE 














Le Flusher isn't just a pretty package — this compact, yet powerful device helps you save up to 50% of water than conventional toilet, helping you make a huge positive impact on the planet and, of course, on your wallet.







   
 Le Flusher can make a half flush or a full flush based on the amount of time you spent on the toilet.





With
this mechanism we can save you per year , up to 11,980 gallons of water :









The Brain is equipped with four adhesives which will allow it to adhere to the wall.It is equipped with a proximity sensor that can detects when you are using the toilet. Once you are done, The Brain allotted 10 - 12 seconds for you to wipe and dispose of the materials , contrary to other automatic toilets. Afterward, The Brain send a signal to The Worker to lift up the flapper to flush the toilet.
For some reason , children always forget to flush their deeds. The worse scenario is when it is a guess who discover the mess.You can imagine the end of the story.
                    


Le Flusher uses a technology called Proximity Sensing to detect whenever someone is sitting on the toilet. This technology has been around for so long, we were able, with precision, to use these metrics to automatically initiate a half flush or a full flush which help you to save on water compare to standard toilet not equipped with ""Le Flusher"".
The Brain Assembly





The Worker (Mechanical part) Assembly



 1- Unpack the device and lift up the tank cover.
 2- stop the water  and flush the toilet.
 3- Install the Worker  in the tank and Place the tank cover  back.
 4- Connect the worker to the brain. DONE!
Once in place, turn on the device and allow the synchronization process to begin, which can takes up to two minutes, and Le Flusher is ready to be use.

The Brain and the Worker ?The Worker goes and hang inside the tank without really touching the water. The Brain goes on the wall behind the toilet at a certain level so that the sensors can detect any person sitting on the toilet or in front of it pointing in the right direction.
What material is it made of? Is it heavy?
The whole Worker part  box is made out of regular plastic, and the whole Brain part is made of the best quality glossy plastic which make look really aesthetic. The Brain is really  light.
Is there any Le Flusher authorised dealer?
Of course, We are hoping to have many. Matter of fact,  you can become one.See our authorized Reseller / Distributor pack or shoot us an email : info@leflusher.com

<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p><b>How is happi ""world's first""?</b></p>
<p>- happi is world's first app that counts emojis and emoticons you've exchanged in different IM-apps and shared on your social media</p>
<p><b>What IM-apps and social media are covered?</b></p>
<p>- Due to technical reasons, happi will analyze messages from all Facebook Messenger, all SMS messages and direct Twitter messages (200 newest)</p>
<p><b>Is happi iOS or Android?</b></p>
<p>- Happi will be Android due to technical reasons (for example, SMS fetching is not enabled in iOS), but if the budget makes it possible, we will launch an iOS app that does everything the same, but focuses on Facebook Messenger and statuses</p>
<p><b>What emotions will be covered?</b></p>
<p>- In the first version, we want to cover LOVE emoticons, HAPPY emoticons and SAD emoticons and emojis. Different emoticons will be counted and analyzed within these gorups (i.e. :), :)), :D, :-) as HAPPY emoticons).</p>
<p><b>Will you focus only on emoticons and emojis?</b></p>
<p>- happi will focus only on emoticons and emojis except in Facebook statuses where ""feeling"" part would be counted (i.e. Feeling sad, happy, in love etc.)</p>
<p><b>What about mood up-er?</b></p>
<p>- happi will display notifications with lifting content - proverbs and motivation. It will also help you be aware of different jubilees, i.e. that you have just exchange :* #100 with Mike, so that you can celebrate your friendships and relationships.</p>
<p><b>Will i be able to turn the notifications off?</b></p>
<p>- Yes. Either for different emoticons/emojis, different person or totally.</p>
<p><b>Privacy concerns?</b></p>
<p>- None, because no messages are stored or shared with anyone, happi only analyzes what's in your inbox, sent messages or statuses, and it only focuses on emojis and emoticons. You can share the results you get (check the video for screen previews).</p>

LifeSymb provides
a unique, artificial intelligent application that allows for highly
individualised body screenings, including automatic analysis and
recommendations. Our mission is to provide the individual with innovative solutions, allowing them to manage their health independently. Are you searching
for a solution to reduce pain or recover faster from an injury? Or do you just
want to improve your fitness and learn more about your body? You get all of
this with LifeSymb.Human expertise meets artificial intelligence: LifeSymb - The best of both worlds.

1. Screen your movements
Perform a selection of basic movements in fron of the camera. THe application is markerless and based on depth data, that means you can perform the screen whereever you are and how often you want.2. Identify your weaknesses
You can then see your results on your personal web
interface after only 2 minutes. Learn about weaknesses, dysfunctions and imbalances and track
your individual progress.

3. Learn how to reduce risks and improve fitness

Hundreds
of personalised automatic recommendations, including treatments and manual therapy, are
accessible in the personal user interface directly after the screening.
4. Connect with personal trainers, therapists and professional health care providers directly through our social network. 

LifeSymb comes with a social network that allows you to follow your fitness and health provider before you contact them. You can then easily connect and let them monitor your progress. 
You can basically live in the USA and have a Personal Trainer in Germany or Sweden! All you need is a 3D camera and a computer.

Train, collect points, and transform them to money for social or environmental projects
We have built a points system to reward your efforts. The more
 you train, the more points you get. You can easily see how well your

The system can be easily programmed on a mobile device to control interactive target scenarios.   Key data from the engagement sequence is recorded and analyzed, allowing the shooter's performance to be scored and / or evaluated.  All while being available in real time on the observers smart phone.  The second generation of this unit will also show the location of actual target hits on your cell phone / smart device screen.</p><p> This portable system is ideal for recreational shooting, shooting competitions, as well as law enforcement and military training scenarios.</p><p>
</p><p>Apex Target System is a unique, durable, cost conscious,
effective training and competition solution that can be utilized by the
shooting enthusiast, competitive shooters, law enforcement, and the military.</p>
<p><b>What sets Apex apart?</b></p>
<p>Unlike Apex, other competitor systems either fall short on
features or are cost prohibitive. 
Nothing in the current market integrates mobile technology with their
target systems.  Mobile technology is
just one of the many features that Apex Target Systems offer. Dynamic situations that can be consistently
and accurately evaluated easily with overall scenario times, reaction times,
and scoring, create a better and more useful experience. </p>
<p>Often a trip to the range, or even a shooting competition,
is characterized by fixed paper or cardboard targets - with occasional steel
targets that may move.  The Apex Target
System brings a whole new facet to the shooting range, providing an experience
that is much more interactive, useful, and fun.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434245495/wqiagtpn8vgay71txyx3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Advanced military ranges utilize dynamic targets to simulate
more realism in training.  The realism,
which makes shooting more meaningful, exciting and effective, is missing at
most ranges and shooting competitions. 
While shooting at paper or cardboard targets is great for developing
accuracy, safety and basic skills – it lacks full scale excitement that can be
experienced and critical skills that are developed to handle a real world
scenario. The dynamic and interactive Apex Target System can bring these
attributes to shooters of any level of experience. </p>
<p>Nothing does what the Apex Target System can do at an
affordable price.  Military style
systems, which are prohibitively expensive, do not give the feedback and control
that our system provides.</p>
<p>Cutting edge.  Easy to
use.  Technology based.  Dynamic.

</ul>
<p><b>HOW IT WORKS</b></p>
<p>The Apex Target System can be easily programmed on your
mobile device.<span>  The system executes the
presentation of the targets in the order you assign and fall based on the
number of hits you assign to each target to make them fall, you can also assign
maximum times that the target will be exposed. 
The mobile device calculates the time from the start tone until all
targets are successfully engaged, or the time runs out, for the timed portion
of scoring a run – as well as tracking target to target times. With the Apex
Target System analytical and performance data can be instantly viewed on the
mobile device controlling the sequence and any other mobile devices in
Observation Mode logged onto the sequence. 
Skills and performance can instantly be gauged and tracked.</span></p>
<p><b>What the Apex Target System allows
you to do:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Set sequence of targets to
activate / fall in a mobile device utilizing wireless technology that can easily be
installed at any range (private, public, or personal) with an inexpensive server that does not need to be
connected to the Internet, this server can be operated by battery for remote
locations or plug in where an outlet is available</p></li>
<li><p>Set time duration of targets
to be active in a mobile device</p></li>
<li><p>Set the number of hits
required on a target to make it fall in a mobile device</p></li>
<li><p>Time Sequence</p></li>
<li><p>Automatically time the
sequence (from activating a start sound to last shot)</p></li>
<li><p>Record the number of hits
from each sequence in the phone app</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Future
versions will:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identify the location of
each impact in real time</p></li>
<li><p>Automatically score the
round based on time and location of hits</p></li>
</ul>

<p><br/></p></div>","The Apex Target System utilizes a combination of cutting edge electronics, wireless integration, and mobile device apps to produce a more realistic training environment.  The system can be easily programmed on a mobile device to control interactive target scenarios.   Key data from the engagement sequence is recorded and analyzed, allowing the shooter's performance to be scored and / or evaluated.  All while being available in real time on the observers smart phone.  The second generation of this unit will also show the location of actual target hits on your cell phone / smart device screen. This portable system is ideal for recreational shooting, shooting competitions, as well as law enforcement and military training scenarios.
Apex Target System is a unique, durable, cost conscious,
effective training and competition solution that can be utilized by the
shooting enthusiast, competitive shooters, law enforcement, and the military.
What sets Apex apart?
Unlike Apex, other competitor systems either fall short on
features or are cost prohibitive. 
Nothing in the current market integrates mobile technology with their
target systems.  Mobile technology is
just one of the many features that Apex Target Systems offer. Dynamic situations that can be consistently
and accurately evaluated easily with overall scenario times, reaction times,
and scoring, create a better and more useful experience. 
Often a trip to the range, or even a shooting competition,
is characterized by fixed paper or cardboard targets - with occasional steel
targets that may move.  The Apex Target
System brings a whole new facet to the shooting range, providing an experience
that is much more interactive, useful, and fun.Advanced military ranges utilize dynamic targets to simulate
more realism in training.  The realism,
which makes shooting more meaningful, exciting and effective, is missing at
most ranges and shooting competitions. 
While shooting at paper or cardboard targets is great for developing
accuracy, safety and basic skills – it lacks full scale excitement that can be
experienced and critical skills that are developed to handle a real world
scenario. The dynamic and interactive Apex Target System can bring these
attributes to shooters of any level of experience. 
Nothing does what the Apex Target System can do at an
affordable price.  Military style
systems, which are prohibitively expensive, do not give the feedback and control
that our system provides.
Cutting edge.  Easy to
use.  Technology based.  Dynamic. 
The Apex Target System.

HOW IT WORKS
The Apex Target System can be easily programmed on your
mobile device.  The system executes the
presentation of the targets in the order you assign and fall based on the
number of hits you assign to each target to make them fall, you can also assign
maximum times that the target will be exposed. 
The mobile device calculates the time from the start tone until all
targets are successfully engaged, or the time runs out, for the timed portion
of scoring a run – as well as tracking target to target times. With the Apex
Target System analytical and performance data can be instantly viewed on the
mobile device controlling the sequence and any other mobile devices in
Observation Mode logged onto the sequence. 
Skills and performance can instantly be gauged and tracked.
What the Apex Target System allows
you to do:

Set sequence of targets to
activate / fall in a mobile device utilizing wireless technology that can easily be
installed at any range (private, public, or personal) with an inexpensive server that does not need to be
connected to the Internet, this server can be operated by battery for remote
locations or plug in where an outlet is available
Set time duration of targets
to be active in a mobile device
Set the number of hits
required on a target to make it fall in a mobile device
Time Sequence
Automatically time the
sequence (from activating a start sound to last shot)
Record the number of hits
from each sequence in the phone app

Future
versions will:

Identify the location of
each impact in real time
Automatically score the
round based on time and location of hits

</div></div>","The Yarra Rangers Little League Baseball Team from the outskirts of Melbourne's eastern suburbs are on a journey, with some luck, all the way to the Little League World Series this year in Pennsylvania. 
In a country where baseball is dwarfed by cricket and football, these kids are dreaming the dream that they could take their game all the way from the base of the Dandenong Ranges to the peak of Baseball; the USA.But first they have to beat out 19 other hopeful teams from all over Australia at the Little League Australian Championships June 4-9, 2015 - Lismore NSW.
  That's where you come in 
There are significant costs for each under 12 player to attend the Australian Championships.
Costs for each player include extra uniforms, flights, accommodation, meals, umpires, and first aid at the tournament. 
The players and parents understand we have to do the heavy lifting when it comes to funding this trip and we are all working hard and saving hard to get there. We are hoping that this campaign will assist with subsidising some of the costs in the lead up to Lismore.
The kids are doing their bit to prepare themselves as well as they can by training at least 7 hours a week with the Rangers apart from their other club team commitments. 
All funds raised via this indiegogo campaign will be split evenly between all 14 players.

<div><br/></div>

Make
Waves Yoga is a company dedicated to getting people out of the studio and into
the outdoors to practice and find their center in the finest studio environs
imaginable, the waters of the Pacific Northwest. On water, yoga students discover
new dimensions of concentrated balance, build strength utilizing different
muscle groups and gain new perspectives of calm and serenity, complemented by
the magic of body, plus board, plus water.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks and Challenges</h3> <p></p>
<p>This project is about as tricky as it is to do yoga on a
board, I just have to find my balance. SUP Yoga is a new and trending way of
movement and although it may seem straight forward, there is a lot to account
for to have a successful SUP class. I need boards, paddles, life jackets,
anchors and leashes. I need a trailer and a tow hitch to be able to transport
the boards as well as insurance as an instructor. I also need the standard
things any company needs, business cards, a logo and a business license. Make Waves Yoga is in a state of puzzle pieces that I need you to help me put together.

Make
Waves Yoga is a company dedicated to getting people out of the studio and into
the outdoors to practice and find their center in the finest studio environs
imaginable, the waters of the Pacific Northwest. On water, yoga students discover
new dimensions of concentrated balance, build strength utilizing different
muscle groups and gain new perspectives of calm and serenity, complemented by
the magic of body, plus board, plus water.

   Risks and Challenges 
This project is about as tricky as it is to do yoga on a
board, I just have to find my balance. SUP Yoga is a new and trending way of
movement and although it may seem straight forward, there is a lot to account
for to have a successful SUP class. I need boards, paddles, life jackets,
anchors and leashes. I need a trailer and a tow hitch to be able to transport
the boards as well as insurance as an instructor. I also need the standard
things any company needs, business cards, a logo and a business license. Make Waves Yoga is in a state of puzzle pieces that I need you to help me put together. I will cover the cost of transporting the boards to and from the location we practice at but to get this company off of the ground I need your help! 
I will be utilizing as many social media outlets as possible
to get the word out to help support Make Waves Yoga. Make Waves will stay
present online and update you on the progress of the project throughout the
duration of the 30 days.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>- У вашего малыша болезнь Верднига-Хоффмана, - врачи оглушили родителей Валеры непонятным диагнозом, когда мальчику не исполнилось даже года. Он практически не шевелил ножками, не мог сидеть, ронял головку на грудь. А следом - новый приговор:</p>
<p>- С такой болезнью обычно не доживают до двух лет.

Год за годом ломал медицинские догмы. Не просто отучился в универе, а на дневном отделении. Не просто работает программистом, а удаленно на столичную фирму. Кроме того, парень помогает детям-инвалидам - во владимирских школах внедряются программы дистанционного обучения, которые Валерий разработал лично. Плюс - он член Молодежной думы Владимирской области, помощник депутата местного Законодательного собрания, участник нескольких молодежных форумов «Селигер»...</span>

<p>Но болезнь не отпускает, и никто не знает, что будет завтра: парень борется, однако уже почти не владеет своим телом - все эти годы его мышцы не растут, не развиваются и каждую минуту медленно умирают. А два года назад узнал об уникальном проекте итальянского нейрохирурга Серджио Канаверо: доктор заявил, что готов провести первую в мире операцию по пересадке головы - от больного человека к телу здорового. Фантастика! Но Валера готов хвататься за любую соломинку:</p>
<p>- Я отыскал этого профессора в интернете, написал ему - благо, английским владею свободно, - рассказывает парень. - Если честно, не очень верил, что он откликнется. Но Серджио ответил! Сказал, мой случай подходит идеально, если можно так выразиться. Он искал пациента именно с таким диагнозом. Все это время мы общаемся по электронной почте или по скайпу, обсуждаем перспективы операции. Мама меня поддерживает - тем более, она профессиональный детский психолог. Папа 16 лет назад погиб в автокатастрофе, но, думаю, и он бы не возражал.</p>
<p>- Тебе... не страшно? Ну вот просто - по-человечески...</p>
<p>- Я не знаю... Канаверо честно предупредил: есть риск, что после операции я погибну. Но если не пойти на нее... Я ведь, наверное, тоже... погибну. Я прекрасно все осознаю - успел кучу литературы перелопатить. Но уже решил: не отступлю. С другой строны, если запрятать подальше разговоры о страхах, это же просто интересно! Почувствовать себя героем фантастического романа - почти как в космос слетать.</p>
<p>- Кто-то сейчас прочитает статью и наверняка начнет о морали рассуждать: мол, неэтично это и все такое...</p>
<p>- А пересадка печени, сердца - тоже не этично?</p>

<p>... Врач объяснил Спиридонову: донорами нового тела для него могут стать люди, погибшие из-за травм головного мозга. Или казненные преступники. И особого выбора не дадут: шансов, что все пройдет успешно, что будет полная совместимость по крови и тканям, - один к 17 тысячам.</p>
<p>Правда, дата операции еще не назначена. Профессор Канаверо и денег пока не нашел, и нужный штат - 150 врачей и медсестер - не набрал. Летом этого года профессор повезет свой сенсационный проект в американский Аннаполис на нейрохирургический конгресс. Позвал туда и нашего Валеру.</p>

<p>СПРАВКА ""КП""</p>
<p>Нейрохирург из госпиталя Турина, Серджио Канаверо, обрел всеитальянскую славу и прозвище «доктор Франкенштейн» в 2013 году, когда заявил в интервью популярному журналу «Панорама» о своей готовности пересадить голову от одного тела к другому.</p>
<p>Надо сказать, что местные трансплантологии и коллеги по цеху вкупе со специалистами по реабилитации больных с травмой позвоночника сразу отнеслись к его идеям скептически.</p>
<p>Одни называли его гением, другие сравнивали с другим «тружеником от науки», Давидэ Ваннони, обещавшем излечить больных раком детей, выращивая стволовые клетки «при помощи крыс», то есть, по сути, назвали Серджио шарлатаном. Не осталась равнодушной и Католическая церковь, назвав его работы нео-евгеникой и трансгуманизмом чистой воды.</p>
<p>Скепсис коллег, «несовершенство законодательства Италии» и непонимание патриархов в итоге вынудили его обратить взор на США, «страну, где наука довлеет над предрассудками».</p>
<p>По признанию самого доктора Франкенштейна, он черпал вдохновение в исследованиях американца Роберта Вайта, проводившего аналогичные опыты в 70-х годах прошлого века на обезьянах. По мнению Канаверо, если скрестить опыт более чем сорокалетней давности с современными нанотехнологиями, все получится. Именно супер нано-нож и нано-молекулярный клей, призванный срастить нервные окончания, являются залогом успеха мероприятия, который сам ученый оценивает в 95 процентов.</p>
<p>При этом на возражения специалистов по реабилитации пациентов, перенесших травму позвоночника, отвергающих возможность сращивания верхних отделов (непосредственно соединяющихся с головным мозгом) спинного мозга, доктор ответил, что «эти ретгограды не знают и половины о том, как работает этот орган».</p>
<p>А вот обвинения религиозных деятелей парировал тем, что «голова тела-донора будет сразу кремирована и похоронена по желанию усопшего».</p>
<p>Кроме того, уверен, что помимо помощи обездвиженным больным, его метод позволит получить пожилым реципиентам и «вторую молодость», поскольку «кровь и гормоны от более молодого тела оздоровят не только старый мозг, но и мышцы, кожу лица. И это более реально, чем проект нейроуправляемого аватара».</p>
<p>Кроме того, претендует и на роль первооткрывателя загробной жизни. По его мнению, голова во время пересадки получит, в отличии от испытавших клиническую смерть, «настоящий предсмертный опыт» и «когда вернется, сможет рассказать, что там видела», и это будет «бесспорным доказательством сознания после смерти».</p>

Hope: Valery Spiridonov wants to be the first person to undergo a head transplant so he can have a shot at having a healthy body having suffered from the Werdnig-Hoffman muscle wasting disease

  Mr Spiridonov said: 'I don't do this because I don't have a life but I think that science is developed by those who are ready to take risks and devote themselves to it'



Controversial: Surgeon Dr Sergio Canavero claims all the necessary techniques already exist to transplant a head onto a donor body, despite widespread scepticism 
'Am I afraid? Yes, of course I am. But it is not just very scary, but also very interesting,' said Mr Spiridonov from his home in Vladimir, a city 120 miles east of Moscow. 'But you have to understand that I don't really have many choices', he said. 'If I don't try this chance my fate will be very sad. With every year my state is getting worse.' 'The idea to transplant not only organs but the head has been studied for a long time even by Russian specialists. But an actual transplantation of the human head was never conducted.'Mr Spiridonov contacted the controversial doctor, who is based at the University of Turin in Italy, after reading about his ambitious medical claims.He said: 'I contacted Professor Canavero two years ago after reading about his works. I offered myself to him to make this operation possible. We have never met and we just communicate via emails.'For the last two years we've been talking this idea through and planning the operation.'He's a very experienced neurosurgeon and has conducted many serious operations. Of course he has never done anything like this and we have to think carefully through all the possible risks.'The Russian has compared the pioneering procedure to the space race of the post-war years.He said: 'In the end it is like with astronauts. Before the first man we sent into space, 300 different scenarios of something going wrong were thought through but when he actually did it, it was the 301st scenario that happened.'Mr Spiridonov denies his pledge to be a guinea pig is a stunt, and insists he goes into it with his eyes open.'If I want this kind of surgery to happen, I shouldn't put the responsibility onto someone else but should try it on myself.'My family fully supports me. They also understand all the risks and even if they think that it's too dangerous, they still support me in my decision.' Despite his severe disabilities Mr Spiridonov has lead a full life, graduating from university with a degree in computer science.
It is already 40 years since the first monkey head transplant and since then an operation on a mouse has been carried out in China.
But Dr Canavero claims all the necessary techniques already exist to carry out a full human head transplant.
He believes he just needs to put the relevant techniques together to carry out the first successful operation.
The new body would come from a normal transplant donor, who is declared brain dead.
Both the donor and the patient would have their head severed from their spinal cord at the same time, using an ultra-sharp blade to give a clean cut.
The patient's head would then be moved on to the donor's body and attached using a 'glue' called polyethylene glycol to fuse the two ends of the spinal cord together.
The muscles and blood supply would be stitched up, before the patient is put into a coma for four weeks to stop them moving while the head and body heal together.
During that time the patient would be given small electric shocks to stimulate their spinal cord and strengthen the connections between their head and new body.
As the patient is brought out of their medically-induced coma, it is hoped they would be able to move, feel their face, and even speak with the same voice.
Powerful immunosuppressant drugs would be prescribed to stop the new body from being rejected.
In addition, the patient would require intensive psychological support. 
'I lost my father in a car crash 16 years ago,' he told MailOnline. 'He was a military man, a lieutenant colonel. So I had to start supporting the family at an early age.'My mother is a child psychologist in a rehabilitation centre for children who got into difficult situations.'I graduated from the Faculty of Information Technologies of Vladimir State University.

At some point of time this was considered to be unethical as well.'There was much talk about where the human soul is located, and if it's ethical to do the heart transplants, but now doctors do it and save people's lives.'I think it's the normal way of technology to evolve. It would be strange to stop at this point when the neurosurgery is ready to take the next step.'The bodies used for transplant could be those of people whose brain was damaged, let's say in a car crash or motorbike accident, or who are sentenced to capital punishment.'But, of course, in future humanity should learn how to grow healthy bodies for the transplants so there will be no shortage of organs and bodies.'Mr Spiridonov says he understands that the Italian surgeon can only go ahead when he is satisfied that medical science is sufficiently advanced. dailymail  I have to go to Annapolis this summer.

У Валерия Спиридонова тяжелейшее генетическое заболевание. Спасать его взялся итальянский профессор из Турина - «пришив» парню новое тело 


Валере 30, живет во Владимире, отучился в университете, работает программистом. Казалось бы - все как у всех. С той лишь разницей, что он всю жизнь прикован к инвалидной коляске. И вообще должен был умереть еще 28 лет назад.
- У вашего малыша болезнь Верднига-Хоффмана, - врачи оглушили родителей Валеры непонятным диагнозом, когда мальчику не исполнилось даже года. Он практически не шевелил ножками, не мог сидеть, ронял головку на грудь. А следом - новый приговор:
- С такой болезнью обычно не доживают до двух лет. Извините...    А Валера жил. Год за годом ломал медицинские догмы. Не просто отучился в универе, а на дневном отделении. Не просто работает программистом, а удаленно на столичную фирму. Кроме того, парень помогает детям-инвалидам - во владимирских школах внедряются программы дистанционного обучения, которые Валерий разработал лично. Плюс - он член Молодежной думы Владимирской области, помощник депутата местного Законодательного собрания, участник нескольких молодежных форумов «Селигер»...


Но болезнь не отпускает, и никто не знает, что будет завтраФото: СОЦСЕТИ

Но болезнь не отпускает, и никто не знает, что будет завтра: парень борется, однако уже почти не владеет своим телом - все эти годы его мышцы не растут, не развиваются и каждую минуту медленно умирают. А два года назад узнал об уникальном проекте итальянского нейрохирурга Серджио Канаверо: доктор заявил, что готов провести первую в мире операцию по пересадке головы - от больного человека к телу здорового. Фантастика! Но Валера готов хвататься за любую соломинку:
- Я отыскал этого профессора в интернете, написал ему - благо, английским владею свободно, - рассказывает парень. - Если честно, не очень верил, что он откликнется. Но Серджио ответил! Сказал, мой случай подходит идеально, если можно так выразиться. Он искал пациента именно с таким диагнозом. Все это время мы общаемся по электронной почте или по скайпу, обсуждаем перспективы операции. Мама меня поддерживает - тем более, она профессиональный детский психолог. Папа 16 лет назад погиб в автокатастрофе, но, думаю, и он бы не возражал.
- Тебе... не страшно? Ну вот просто - по-человечески...
- Я не знаю... Канаверо честно предупредил: есть риск, что после операции я погибну. Но если не пойти на нее... Я ведь, наверное, тоже... погибну. Я прекрасно все осознаю - успел кучу литературы перелопатить. Но уже решил: не отступлю. С другой строны, если запрятать подальше разговоры о страхах, это же просто интересно! Почувствовать себя героем фантастического романа - почти как в космос слетать.
- Кто-то сейчас прочитает статью и наверняка начнет о морали рассуждать: мол, неэтично это и все такое...
- А пересадка печени, сердца - тоже не этично?

... Врач объяснил Спиридонову: донорами нового тела для него могут стать люди, погибшие из-за травм головного мозга. Или казненные преступники. И особого выбора не дадут: шансов, что все пройдет успешно, что будет полная совместимость по крови и тканям, - один к 17 тысячам.
Правда, дата операции еще не назначена. Профессор Канаверо и денег пока не нашел, и нужный штат - 150 врачей и медсестер - не набрал. Летом этого года профессор повезет свой сенсационный проект в американский Аннаполис на нейрохирургический конгресс. Позвал туда и нашего Валеру.

 
СПРАВКА ""КП""
Нейрохирург из госпиталя Турина, Серджио Канаверо, обрел всеитальянскую славу и прозвище «доктор Франкенштейн» в 2013 году, когда заявил в интервью популярному журналу «Панорама» о своей готовности пересадить голову от одного тела к другому.
Надо сказать, что местные трансплантологии и коллеги по цеху вкупе со специалистами по реабилитации больных с травмой позвоночника сразу отнеслись к его идеям скептически.
Одни называли его гением, другие сравнивали с другим «тружеником от науки», Давидэ Ваннони, обещавшем излечить больных раком детей, выращивая стволовые клетки «при помощи крыс», то есть, по сути, назвали Серджио шарлатаном. Не осталась равнодушной и Католическая церковь, назвав его работы нео-евгеникой и трансгуманизмом чистой воды.
Скепсис коллег, «несовершенство законодательства Италии» и непонимание патриархов в итоге вынудили его обратить взор на США, «страну, где наука довлеет над предрассудками».
По признанию самого доктора Франкенштейна, он черпал вдохновение в исследованиях американца Роберта Вайта, проводившего аналогичные опыты в 70-х годах прошлого века на обезьянах. По мнению Канаверо, если скрестить опыт более чем сорокалетней давности с современными нанотехнологиями, все получится. Именно супер нано-нож и нано-молекулярный клей, призванный срастить нервные окончания, являются залогом успеха мероприятия, который сам ученый оценивает в 95 процентов.
При этом на возражения специалистов по реабилитации пациентов, перенесших травму позвоночника, отвергающих возможность сращивания верхних отделов (непосредственно соединяющихся с головным мозгом) спинного мозга, доктор ответил, что «эти ретгограды не знают и половины о том, как работает этот орган».
А вот обвинения религиозных деятелей парировал тем, что «голова тела-донора будет сразу кремирована и похоронена по желанию усопшего».
Кроме того, уверен, что помимо помощи обездвиженным больным, его метод позволит получить пожилым реципиентам и «вторую молодость», поскольку «кровь и гормоны от более молодого тела оздоровят не только старый мозг, но и мышцы, кожу лица. И это более реально, чем проект нейроуправляемого аватара».
Кроме того, претендует и на роль первооткрывателя загробной жизни. По его мнению, голова во время пересадки получит, в отличии от испытавших клиническую смерть, «настоящий предсмертный опыт» и «когда вернется, сможет рассказать, что там видела», и это будет «бесспорным доказательством сознания после смерти».

<p><b>What are the payment options?<br/></b>You can pay via paypal or creditcard. After you chose your perk you will be redirected to Paypal where you can chose payment options without any registration.

<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">What happens if the funding goal isn’t reached?<br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Indiegogo offers flexible funding, which means that every ordered Gentletent will be produced and shipped anyway, even if we don’t reach the funding goal.</span></span></p>

</span><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Is the Gentletent waterproof?<br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Yes, the fabrics of our Gentletents are wind-, water-, and weatherproof. The unique form of the tent promotes the water outlet. Therefore the fabrics aren’t subjected to high waterpressure. Hydrostatic head of the Gentletent: Flyer - 600mm, Floor - 10.000mm.</span></span></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
</span><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">What about strong winds?<br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The resistent carcase of the Gentletent provides only little windage. The circular form also guarantees for stability and resistance in any situation.</span></span></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">

You can use any airpump that meets following requirements: 300mbar, 0,3 bar or 4,5 psi. Though you need a fitting adapter, which is delivered with all of our airpumps.</span></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
</span><p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Will you ship internationally?</b>Yes!</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">What are your shipment fees?<br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Too keep the shipping costs as little as possible we decided to charge shipment fees by the end of our campaign. Nevertheless we guarantee you a maximum fee for every product, which you can see when ordering your Gentletent.</span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>Als leidenschaftliche Camper waren wir von traditionellen Zelten enttäuscht. Komplizierter Aufbau, mangelnde Qualität und die fehlende Flexibilität veranlassten uns dazu, es RICHTIG zu machen. Wir gründeten Gentletent. Unsere Vision war es, ein Zelt zu entwickeln, dass in puncto Handhabung, Funktionalität neue Maßstäbe setzt und dabei hochwert verarbeitet und für alle Camping-Situationen gerüstet ist.  Unsere Gentletents sind  Zelte für alle, die Zeit, Stress und Geld sparen wollen!

<p><b>Aufgebaut in 60 Sekunden</b></p>
<p>Während andere noch mit Zeltstangen hantieren, sind unsere Airtents bereits aufgebaut. Möglich macht es das pneumatische Rohrsystem, das durch eine Handpumpe gefüllt wird und so das Zelt in Form bringt.</p>

<p><b>Abbau mit einem Knopfdruck</b></p>
<p>Um sein Gentletent abzubauen, genügt es die Ventile zu öffnen. Nach wenigen Sekunden kann das Zelt samt Handpumpe und Zeltnägel in der Tasche verstaut werden. Und das Beste: Es gibt keine Stangen oder andere Teile, die man vergessen könnte!</p>

<li>
<p><b>Ein neuartiges Design für mehr Platz &amp; Komfort</b></p>
<p>Wir haben bewusst auf die Iglu-Form herkömmlicher Zeltsysteme verzichtet. So schaffen wir mehr Raum und Sitzhöhe durch den Wegfall schräger Wände, angenehmen Luftaustausch mit 2 Luftöffnungen und eine wetterstabile Form.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430912564/kgmth9rsvnvogitobzow.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>

<p>In unseren Zelten fühlt man sich wie zuhause. Das gewährleisten nicht nur die verarbeiteten Materialien und deren Atmungsaktivität, sondern auch die spezielle Form der Zelte. Mit 2 separaten Öffnungen ist für einen regen Luftaustausch gesorgt,  zudem wird Kondensbildung durch atmungsaktive Stoffe verhindert. </p>

<p>Viele wollen Zelten, aber dabei nicht auf ihr Fahrzeug verzichten. Mit der GT-Car-Connection bieten wir euch die Möglichkeit eure Gentletents mit Motorrad, PKW und Bus zu verbinden. So erspart ihr euch den lästigen Weg zum Auto und zurück. Der Autoanschluss erfolgt einfach per Zip am Gentletent und mit Saugnäpfen auf eurem Fahrzeug. Das erspart euch nicht nur die Abspannung eures Zeltes, sondern schafft auch ein schützendes Vordach.</p>

Let's Make Camping Easier!  
As passionate campers we were disappointed by common tents. Long and complicated build-up, poor quality and they often lacked of usability and functionality. That's why we have started GENTLETENT. We wanted to create an easy-to-use, convenient but also high quality and functional CAMPING TENT for everyone who’s up for saving time, stress and money.



Easier, faster and more intuitive to pitch than common tents 



Erected in 60 seconds
Gentletents are air-filled camping tents containing no rods and poles. While others are sorting out tent parts and „building“-up tents, you just have to inflate the tent and save a lot of time!





Striking with the press of a button
Putting your Gentletent down is a matter of seconds. High quality valves guarantee safe and secure in/de-flating. No worries about forgetting a tent part, our airtents come in a convenient one-piece design.




A packaging growing with your tent
Don’t worry if you have put down your tent in a hurry, our unique packaging will „grow“ with your package size to contain all the necessary stuff: tent, pump, tent pegs.







A functional and weatherproof mobile home in an one piece design 




A comfortable, generous and functional shape
We have abandoned the igluu shape to create a more convenient and spacious interior. 2 air openings for air exchange, no skewed walls and a comfortable height will make your tent a mobile home. 




No additional tent parts for a stressless and easy camping experience
The airtent construction, our high quality and breathable components make it possible to reduce tent parts such as poles, rods and additional tent walls. By reducing the complexity of a tent, we are creating a one-piece tent which is still reparable and easy to maintain but very handy to use.






Flexibility and functionality as never seen before in a tent 






Carry your Gentletent around - the next adventure is already waiting
A small package size and little weight will make your Gentletent easy to transport. Carry it around, stow it in your car or in the pannier of a motorcycle. Because camping shouldn’t be just a long planned activity - Gentletents enable you to go camping spontaneously.



Connectable to any car, bus, caravan & motorcycle 
Leave your stuff in your vehicle and create an additional awning by using our GT-Car-Connection. It seamlessly connects to your car/bus and also saves some anchoring.




A tent for every purpose
A tent isn’t just a bare sleeping berth. We are considering tents as versatile mobile homes with high functionality and a stunning usability. The answer to the needs of camping lovers who appreciate both an easy and comfortable experience. 





Wind- and weatherproof components for safe, secure and long lasting camping experiences 









High quality components
Resilient components such as Cordura and TenCate AllSeason Touring withstand any weather. UV-resistant, breathable and robust, our fabrics create a stable and weatherproof tent. 





Testing under various conditions 
During the development of our Gentletents we have run several tests proving the quality of our tents. Convince yourselves!




























 
GENTLETENT MODELS: 3 types for every camping purpose 




Making camping easier means providing different models for every purpose. We have developed 3 Gentletents, differing in size but including all the neat features mentioned above.

WHAT MAKES OUR GENTLETENT SO SPECIAL?





SIMPLE USE

Our tent is built up within a minute and taking it down is even easier. All you need is a Gentletent and an air-pump, which is part of delivery. Say goodbye to the pitch-frustration of your old tent! 


















Our tent is built up within a minute and taking it down is even easier. All you need is a Gentletent and an air-pump, which is part of delivery. Say goodbye to the pitch-frustration of your old tent!




With a packaging size as small as a bedroll our Gentletents are perfect travel companions, flexible and easy to transport. You can even take it on a plane as handluggage.




 
 

UNIQUE DESIGN




Air-filled pipe-system:Gentletents are air-filled camping tents. Therefore we have created a revolutionary pipe-system holding a singular and replacable inner pipe.Covered by extremly robust Cordura fabrics which is also used in motorcycling safety clothes, the air filled pipe system will remain stable and give our tents the extraordinary shape and design.The unique form facilitates the wateroutlet and withstands even the windiest weather. Hydrostatic head ranges from 600-10.000mm.






Colours:Gentletents are available in 2 colours. We will contact you after your purchase asking for your favorite colour option.






OUTSTANDING QUALITYExtraordinary quality and a fair sustainable production are very important to us. After all we want our clients to have a real nature experience. 

 





Gentletent TentwallThe Gentletent's coating is made out of TenCate All Season Touring.The canvas is known for its:

Lightness & durability
UV-resistance,
high breathability,
waterproof
weather resistant and
observance of high enviromental restrictions


















     Gentletent Pipe System:The most important part of a Gentletent is its elastic and resistant thermoplastic polyurethane pipe. It is covered by Cordura, an abrasion-proof cloth that is even used  for riding suits and workwear. So we can guarantee full protection to our tube-system and longevity for all  our Gentletents!








Rafting ValvesTo ensure the required safety, we use high quality rafting valves for our Gentletents. Possible overpressure is prevented by a special overload pressure valve.











   Tent Pegs   The Gentletent comes with high  quality tent pegs, which are very  robust and hardly bendable. They are  suitable for nearly every ground and to  be honest, compared to other tent  pegs they look really cool!







 GENTLE ATMOSPHERE
High quality components and generous air openings provide an excellent indoor tent climate. The breathability of our fabrics avoids condensation build-up and makes a night in a Gentletent as enjoyable as being home.
 












ADD-ONS

 

GENTLETENT CAR CONNECTION


A lot of people love camping but don't want to go without their car. That's why we offer a connection for the Gentletent S and Classic. With vacuum cups it's pleasingly easy to attach your Gentletent to any car. The Gentletent Classic can even be connected to any camping bus, so you can use it as an awning.







GENTLETENT POWERPACK

You also can't do without your Smartphone or other electronic devices while camping? That's no problem anymore. With the Gentletent Powerpack you can equip your Gentletent with solar power and you'll never run out of battery again.

FAQ

What are the payment options?You can pay via paypal or creditcard. After you chose your perk you will be redirected to Paypal where you can chose payment options without any registration. Please contact us via crowdfunding@gentletent.com  if you haven't access to any of those options.
What happens if the funding goal isn’t reached?Indiegogo offers flexible funding, which means that every ordered Gentletent will be produced and shipped anyway, even if we don’t reach the funding goal.

Is the Gentletent waterproof?Yes, the fabrics of our Gentletents are wind-, water-, and weatherproof. The unique form of the tent promotes the water outlet. Therefore the fabrics aren’t subjected to high waterpressure. Hydrostatic head of the Gentletent: Flyer - 600mm, Floor - 10.000mm.

What about strong winds?The resistent carcase of the Gentletent provides only little windage. The circular form also guarantees for stability and resistance in any situation.

Can I use another airpump beside the delivered one?Yes of course! You can use any airpump that meets following requirements: 300mbar, 0,3 bar or 4,5 psi. Though you need a fitting adapter, which is delivered with all of our airpumps.

Will you ship internationally?Yes!
What are your shipment fees?Too keep the shipping costs as little as possible we decided to charge shipment fees by the end of our campaign. Nevertheless we guarantee you a maximum fee for every product, which you can see when ordering your Gentletent.

THANK YOU



for supporting us and helping make camping easier

















Wir machen Zelten einfacher!
  
Als leidenschaftliche Camper waren wir von traditionellen Zelten enttäuscht. Komplizierter Aufbau, mangelnde Qualität und die fehlende Flexibilität veranlassten uns dazu, es RICHTIG zu machen. Wir gründeten Gentletent. Unsere Vision war es, ein Zelt zu entwickeln, dass in puncto Handhabung, Funktionalität neue Maßstäbe setzt und dabei hochwert verarbeitet und für alle Camping-Situationen gerüstet ist.  Unsere Gentletents sind  Zelte für alle, die Zeit, Stress und Geld sparen wollen!



Schneller Aufbau, kinderleichte Handhabung und weniger Stress 



Aufgebaut in 60 Sekunden
Während andere noch mit Zeltstangen hantieren, sind unsere Airtents bereits aufgebaut. Möglich macht es das pneumatische Rohrsystem, das durch eine Handpumpe gefüllt wird und so das Zelt in Form bringt.





Abbau mit einem Knopfdruck
Um sein Gentletent abzubauen, genügt es die Ventile zu öffnen. Nach wenigen Sekunden kann das Zelt samt Handpumpe und Zeltnägel in der Tasche verstaut werden. Und das Beste: Es gibt keine Stangen oder andere Teile, die man vergessen könnte!




Einpacken leicht gemacht
Bei uns wird das Zelt nicht in eine Tasche gestopft. Unsere Verpackung passt sich dem zusammengeklappten Zelt an und bietet Platz für Zelt, Pumpe und Zeltnägel







Funktionales, wind- und wetterfestes Design  




Ein neuartiges Design für mehr Platz & Komfort
Wir haben bewusst auf die Iglu-Form herkömmlicher Zeltsysteme verzichtet. So schaffen wir mehr Raum und Sitzhöhe durch den Wegfall schräger Wände, angenehmen Luftaustausch mit 2 Luftöffnungen und eine wetterstabile Form.



Keine Stangen = kein Stress
Die Airtent-Bauweise ermöglicht uns in Kombination mit hochwertigen und atmungsaktiven Komponenten auf Stangen und andere Zeltteile zu verzichten. 





Noch nie gesehene Flexibilität & Funktionalität 






Mitnehmen, auspacken und fertig!
Das geringe Packmaß und Gewicht machen ein Gentletent transportabel. Egal ob über die Schulter geschnallt, im Kofferraum oder in der Seitentasche des Motorrads, mit unseren Zelten haben Sie endlich wieder die Möglichkeit spontan Zelten zu gehen.



Nahtlose Anbindung an PKW, Bus oder Motorrad
Lass dein Gepäck im Auto und genieße eine zusätzliche Überdachung. Die GT-Car-Connection macht es möglich und schafft eine nahtlose Verbindung zwischen Zelt und Fahrzeug.





Wind- und wetterfeste Komponenten für ein sicheres und langes Camping-Vergnügen 









Hochwertige Komponenten
Widerstandsfähige Komponenten wie Cordura und TenCate AllSeason Touring halten jedem Wetter und jeder Belastung stand.  UV-resistent, atmungsaktiv und robust - unsere Stoffe sorgen für ein stabiles und wetterfestes Zelt.





Dutzende Tests bestanden 
In unserem 2-jährigen Entwicklungsprozess haben wir unsere Zelte dutzenden Tests unterzogen um uns der Qualität und Sicherheit unseres System zu versichern.



























 
GENTLETENT MODELLE: 3 Größen für jede Gelegenheit







Einfacheres Zelten heißt auch auf die Bedürfnisse der Camping-Liebhaber einzugehen. Unsere Gentletents gibt es in 3 verschiedenen Größen - allesamt vereinen sie die Vorzüge unserer neuen Zeltgeneration.

Das perfekte Zelt für einen spontanen Ausflug mit Freunden oder Familie. Kinderleicht zu bedienen, Platz für 3 Personen und doch leicht und einfach zu transportieren.

WAS MACHT UNSERE GENTLETENTS SO BESONDERS?





SIMPLE USE


Bei der Entwicklung unserer Zelte stand die einfache Handhabung im Vordergrund. Der Auf- und Abbau eines Gentletents soll so einfach wie möglich funktionieren. 


















Unsere Zelte sind innerhalb einer Minute aufgebaut. Alles, was du brauchst, ist ein Gentletent und eine Handpumpe (im Lieferumfang enthalten). Es gibt keine Stangen, die durch Laschen gefädelt werden müssen, und keine komplizierten Aufbauprozeduren.




Das nächste Abenteuer wartet schon auf dich. Deshalb legen wir Wert auf ein geringes Gewicht und kompakte Verpackungsmaße. So kann das Gentletent leicht verstaut werden und ist immer in Griffweite, wenn dich die Lust packt.




 
 

UNIQUE DESIGN




Rohrsystem:Das Herz eines jeden Gentletents ist sein revolutionäres Rohrsystem. Ein durchgängiger elastischer 10 Meter langer Schlauch mit einer Füllkapazität von 154 Liter (Gentletent XS) wird von einem robusten und verwindungssteifen Textilmantel in Form gehalten. Während die einzigartige Figur des Gentletents den Wasserabfluss begünstigt, hält der Rohrkörper sogar starken Winden stand. Unsere Zeltstoffe verfügen über eine Wassersäule von 600 - 10.000mm.






Farben:Jedes Gentletent ist in 2 der folgenden Farbkombinationen erhältlich. Nachdem du dich für ein Gentletent Modell deiner Wahl entschieden hast, kontaktieren wir dich bzgl. Farbauswahl.






OUTSTANDING QUALITYAußergewöhnliche Qualität und nachhaltige faire Produktionsbedingungen stehen im Zentrum unserer Bemühungen. 

 





Gentletent ZeltstoffDie Zeltwand unserer Gentletents besteht aus hochwertigem TenCate All Season Touring.Der Zeltstoff überzeugt durch:
Geringes Gewicht & hohe Widerstandsfähigkeit
UV-Resistenz
Hohe Atmungsaktivität
Wind-, Wasser- und Wetterfestigkeit
Umweltverträgliche Fertigung

















     Gentletent Pipe System:Der Schlauch aus thermoplastischem      Polyurethan wird von einem Cordura-   Mantel umhüllt. Letzteres findet vor    allem bei Schutzbekleidungen    (Motorsport, Feuerwehr und Militär)    Anwendung und sorgt durch seine    Abriebfestigkeit für  den sicheren Schutz des Luftsystems!








Rafting ValvesDie Verwendung hochwertiger Ventile erleichtert das Aufpumpen der Gentletents . Und keine Sorgen: Der eingebaute Überdruckmechanismus verhindert, dass du zuviel Luft einpumpst.











   Tent Pegs   Unsere Zeltnägel   sind stabil und kaum zu verbiegen. Mit     diesen Heringen seid ihr für sehr viele    Untergrundarten bestens gerüstet.







 GENTLE ATMOSPHERE
In unseren Zelten fühlt man sich wie zuhause. Das gewährleisten nicht nur die verarbeiteten Materialien und deren Atmungsaktivität, sondern auch die spezielle Form der Zelte. Mit 2 separaten Öffnungen ist für einen regen Luftaustausch gesorgt,  zudem wird Kondensbildung durch atmungsaktive Stoffe verhindert. 
 












ERWEITERUNGEN

 

GENTLETENT CAR CONNECTION


Viele wollen Zelten, aber dabei nicht auf ihr Fahrzeug verzichten. Mit der GT-Car-Connection bieten wir euch die Möglichkeit eure Gentletents mit Motorrad, PKW und Bus zu verbinden. So erspart ihr euch den lästigen Weg zum Auto und zurück. Der Autoanschluss erfolgt einfach per Zip am Gentletent und mit Saugnäpfen auf eurem Fahrzeug. Das erspart euch nicht nur die Abspannung eures Zeltes, sondern schafft auch ein schützendes Vordach.






 

GENTLETENT POWERPACK

Camping heißt die Natur genießen, aber wir wissen, dass manche von euch dabei nicht auf Mobiltelefon und Co verzichten wollen. Deshalb gibt es das Gentletent Powerpack. Die Solarfläche wird einfach an das Rohrsystem montiert und ein Kabel führt in den Zeltinnenraum, wo euer Mobiltelefon mit Solarenergie aufgeladen wird. 





 

 
UNTERSTÜTZE UNS




Nach 2-jähriger Entwicklung sind wir bereit für den nächsten Schritt. Mit eurer Hilfe und eurem Beitrag in Form eines Perks können wir den nächsten Schritt machen.
Jeder Beitrag zählt, deshalb haben wir eine Reihe von nützlichen Goodies zusammengestellt, aus denen ihr euren Favoriten auswählen könnt.

<h1><b>OUR STORY</b></h1>
<p>I was shocked to discover my mom was diagnosed with Cancer at the age of 61.  I was in my late 20s at the time and never thought anyone in our family would get sick. I felt so helpless and scared. All I could do is ask questions. I wish I had known the right questions to ask. </p>
<p>I remember my mother lying there after surgery and the terrified look on her face when the doctor said ""The Cancer has spread to your liver and the tumors are too large to remove. Your heart is strong and I can see you've done a great job of taking care of yourself."" Unfortunately despite living a healthy lifestyle, Cancer doesn't discriminate.  My mother struggled by experimenting with different treatments with no real direction.</p>
<p>My mom died from her Colon Cancer. We didn't have the knowledge to make a difference. We didn't know anyone else going through this. We didn't have access to other people fighting Cancer or information about treatments that were working. I realize now, day after day and years later that I didn't just lose my mother to Cancer, I lost my best friend.  </p>
<p>This Cancer App is for other patients like my mom, their family and friends.  It's time to empower others in their fight against Cancer.  Join us in helping people worldwide.</p>

<h1>THE AUTONOMY OF CANCER</h1>
<p>Cancer cells are cells that have lost the ability to follow the normal control that the body exerts on all cells. In our body we have billions of cells and they have different functions. It's an extremely complicated process. When particular cells escape the normal control mechanisms and they continue to grow and they may spread, that's what we call Cancer. Those cells growing together is called a tumor, more specifically a malignant tumor due to the fact it can invade nearby tissue and spread to tissues that are not nearby, which can be life threatening.</p>
<p>Cancer can actually occur anywhere in the body, because there are cells everywhere in the body. It's important to note that Cancer that occurs in one individual is often very different than the Cancer that occurs in another.</p>
<p>Once the diagnosis of Cancer is made, the first obvious question is what do you do now? </p>
<p>Cancer treatment is very complex. Cancer itself is not homogeneous; there may be several slight variations in the present Cancer cells. Which means even if you're able to treat a majority of the Cancer, different variation may still exists in the body which need to be treated altogether differently. </p>
<p>Preparing yourself  is one of the first steps in recovery. Know the important questions you should be asking; what your treatment options are, whether it be surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or a homeopathic approach. Discover what's working for other patients in your surrounding area as well as worldwide. Connect with other people battling the same fight as you, and lets beat cancer together!</p>

Access to others fighting Cancer near by

Resources to empower patients throughout their recovery 

Financial support, realize the generosity of friends and family




OUR STORY
I was shocked to discover my mom was diagnosed with Cancer at the age of 61.  I was in my late 20s at the time and never thought anyone in our family would get sick. I felt so helpless and scared. All I could do is ask questions. I wish I had known the right questions to ask. 
I remember my mother lying there after surgery and the terrified look on her face when the doctor said ""The Cancer has spread to your liver and the tumors are too large to remove. Your heart is strong and I can see you've done a great job of taking care of yourself."" Unfortunately despite living a healthy lifestyle, Cancer doesn't discriminate.  My mother struggled by experimenting with different treatments with no real direction.
My mom died from her Colon Cancer. We didn't have the knowledge to make a difference. We didn't know anyone else going through this. We didn't have access to other people fighting Cancer or information about treatments that were working. I realize now, day after day and years later that I didn't just lose my mother to Cancer, I lost my best friend.  
This Cancer App is for other patients like my mom, their family and friends.  It's time to empower others in their fight against Cancer.  Join us in helping people worldwide.

FEATURES
   

CONNECT
Currently, 7.6 million people die from Cancer each year. Treatment cost range from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Our application has the potential to not only connect cancer patients with the information they need, but help them realize the generosity and support of their friends, family and colleagues.




TREATMENT COSTS
Cost of initial Cancer treatments are more than just financial. We can all agree that when facing life threatening disease, your health should be your number one focus.









THE AUTONOMY OF CANCER
Cancer cells are cells that have lost the ability to follow the normal control that the body exerts on all cells. In our body we have billions of cells and they have different functions. It's an extremely complicated process. When particular cells escape the normal control mechanisms and they continue to grow and they may spread, that's what we call Cancer. Those cells growing together is called a tumor, more specifically a malignant tumor due to the fact it can invade nearby tissue and spread to tissues that are not nearby, which can be life threatening.
Cancer can actually occur anywhere in the body, because there are cells everywhere in the body. It's important to note that Cancer that occurs in one individual is often very different than the Cancer that occurs in another.
Once the diagnosis of Cancer is made, the first obvious question is what do you do now? 
Cancer treatment is very complex. Cancer itself is not homogeneous; there may be several slight variations in the present Cancer cells. Which means even if you're able to treat a majority of the Cancer, different variation may still exists in the body which need to be treated altogether differently. 
Preparing yourself  is one of the first steps in recovery. Know the important questions you should be asking; what your treatment options are, whether it be surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or a homeopathic approach. Discover what's working for other patients in your surrounding area as well as worldwide. Connect with other people battling the same fight as you, and lets beat cancer together!

</p><p><b>Our Mission:</b></p><p>Hello, I’m
Erika Prinz Freed, a licensed acupuncturist in the state of New York. This
September I will be embarking on the <b>Humla Medical
Service Trip</b>, <b>a volunteer healthcare
mission in one of the poorest districts in all of Nepal.</b>  The reason I
chose to enter the healthcare field is to help others—and this volunteer
service trip is a true expression of compassionate care and knowledge in
action. </p>
<p><b><i>The
Humla Medical Service Trip is a grassroots, 501(c)3 nonprofit effort. All
of the volunteers, including myself, must fund their own way. </i></b></p>
<p>During
the Humla Medical Service Trip, I will join doctors, nurses, and
healthcare volunteers, including other acupuncturists, to provide <b>no-cost, high-quality health care</b> to
residents of the area. Our group will trek through the Himalayan mountains and
set up four mobile village clinics where we will offer treatment to hundreds of
patients in need of medical care. Last year the Humla Fund volunteers
treated over <b>700 villagers</b> in the
span of seven days.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Why I’m Asking For Your Help:</b><br/></p>
<p>I am
humbly asking for your charitable support so that I can volunteer my knowledge,
skills and time to help those in need. The money that you donate will help to
fund my cost of the trip, including travel, lodging, food, &amp; support staff,
like translators. Every dollar you donate fund my participation in this
critical volunteer mission.  </p>
<p>The total trip cost is <b>$5300.00 </b>(trip cost + airfare). The
cost of the medical mission itself is <b>$3800.00</b>; this covers
supplies, board, lodging, food, Nepalese staff for trekking &amp; camping,
&amp; an English translator. The airfare is <b>$1500.00</b>. Any additional funds I raise will pay for the
required personal supplies I must bring (0 degrees sleeping bag, sleeping pad,
hiking boots, etc.).</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact:</b><br/></p>
<p>The Humla
District is one of the world’s most remote areas, and extremely poor. The men,
women and children of the region face a devastating lack of education and
healthcare. While the population of the Humla District is 50,000
people, there is only one hospital, which has a shortage of doctors. As a
result, most illnesses and injuries go untreated. Additionally, the recent
earthquakes that recently ravaged Nepal have only worsened circumstances for
residents. The people of the region need hand on healthcare—and our team of
experienced practicioners will be there to provide it.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Track Record of Success:</b><br/></p>
<p>This is the
second year for trip, which is a core project of the Humla Fund, a
501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to strengthening the Bon culture and
traditions in the Humla region of Nepal through access to quality
education, healthcare and sustainable economic development.
The Humla Fund solely relies on donations of medical supplies and
monetary donations to provide medical care to the Humli people.</p>
<p>The trip is
led in part by Tempa Dukte Lama, an ordained Tibetan Bon lama who was born
in Humla, Nepal, into a family of Tibetan Bon and Buddhist practitioners
and healers. Our group will have the opportunity to share in these teachings to
build deeper bridges of understanding within the region.</p>

IS THIS ABOUT?</b></p>
<p>The sports-ground in Vallecito is currently in decay. Few kids
and youngsters use it for sports anymore since the facilities are in terrible

<p><b>WHY
ARE WE DOING THIS?</b></p>
<p>We believe that <b>sport is
a catalyst for human development and peace</b> within a community. We want
Vallecito to have a space for sports and for coming together as a community; a
space that is safe and accessible to everyone. We also believe that the common
struggle to revamp this public space will <b>bring
the community closer together</b>: neighbors from different ages and
backgrounds will be motivated by Father Juan and the Collective to help in
cleaning, repairing and decorating the sports ground. We hope that this process
will trigger more cooperation among the citizens in Vallecito so that <b>together they can build a more secure
neighborhood</b>.</p>
<p>The Vallecito neighborhood is part of the Jose Carlos Mariategui
(JCM) zone in Villa María del Triunfo district. This emerging district was
established in 1961 as an effort to acknowledge the growing informal
settlements and squatter areas on the barren hills of Lima’s south-eastern
border. Today, the whole district of<b>
Villa María del Triunfo houses 441.239 citizens on 71km2, of which 56,7 % live
in poverty and 3,5% live in extreme poverty</b>.[1] The district
has also shown worrisome crime rates while the police and municipal police
(serenazgo) are understaffed: <b>1 police
officer per 1952 citizens and 1 serenazgo per 3238 citizens</b>.[2]</p>
<p>In a neighborhood like Vallecito, the families’ lack of
resources and rising insecurity form a vicious circle that worsens urban living
conditions. The circle works in many ways, one of which is through the <b>loss of public spaces:</b> Growing fear of
robberies and assaults pushes the neighbors to stay at home instead of spending
time in the public spaces of their community. Thus, these spaces are abandoned,
deteriorate and become dangerous as they are frequented by local gangs or petty
criminals. Needless to say, this situation discourages the neighbors even more
from using their public space. Thus, the opportunities for meeting, building
community and sharing resources dwindle, reinforcing the vicious circle.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440193963/yxu4dt5vfcl66osaijs2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

IS THIS ABOUT?
The sports-ground in Vallecito is currently in decay. Few kids

neighbors have few opportunities for recreational activities that contribute to
the development of the youngsters and strengthen the community.
But a group of neighbors has gotten together to recover the

<div>In November 2014, I stood at the top of Vidigal a community (""favela"") in Rio de Janiero.  The climb to the top would have been tiring for even those in top shape. The streets were steep and winding. Vidigal is built on the side of a mountain. The homes were makeshift and covered in graffiti. As I moved nothing I saw inspired me to continue to go deeper into this community, however, something in my heart told me continue. Finally, we reached the top. I was with my cousin who is a few years older than me. I walked on top of an abandoned/unfinished structure. From there I looked out and saw something beautiful. I couldn't move, I wouldn't move. <br/>
</div>
<div>From the top one of the poorest communities was a beautiful view of Rio de Janeiro.   We had a clear view of the sandy beaches of Ipanema beach and Sugarloaf Mountain. The waves looked so calm and inviting. The city of Rio looked friendly and calm. After about an hour I started to walk down. Everything looked different. I watched kids play a soccer game, there was a sport complex. I saw opportunity. An opportunity to improve the lives of others. While I don't know the NGO that set up this complex, I did see the joy in the smiles of these young soccer players. It made me think of how I can help nonprofits create more smiles. </div>
<div>Hello, my name is Achumboro Ataande. I graduated from Vanderbilt Law School in May 2015. I'm the founder of <a href=""http://www.Ourcomm.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ourcomm.org</a> and I'm a social entrepreneur. <br/>
</div>
<div>I'm Christian, and I've been blessed throughout my life. Many of those blessings came through nonprofits. Nonprofits like the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club, which gave me a safe and fun place to spend my childhood while I grew up in the Bronx, NY. Being there helped me avoid drugs and other negative activities. Nonprofits like the Fresh Air Fund. They place inner-city kids with different families during the summer. For some summers, I lived in a town full of Quakers. My experience there gave me an appreciation for people from other cultures and backgrounds. Therefore, I want to help nonprofits provide the love, blessings, and experiences they have provided me to others. </div>
<div>
<b>Together, we can create a social network focused on helping nonprofits become more effective</b>. By creating a common volunteer application process on a website which hosts many great nonprofits and make it easy to volunteer. Imagine being able to find nonprofits by the issues they address or the communities they help. When tragedy strikes, instead of just the big nonprofits you would be able to find the smaller nonprofits who always attended to those areas. We can help them provide more help. </div>

<p>In 1952, a mere 13 years after
Little League Baseball was formed, a group of private citizens affiliated with
Indiana Central College (now known as University of Indianapolis) donated the
land that Indiana Central Little League now rests on. Indiana Central Little
League (ICLL) is proud to be the oldest operating little league park in the
State of Indiana. The year 2015 marked out 63st year of providing a safe and
beautiful place for boys and girls of all ages to play America's favorite
pastime. </p>
<p>ICLL started very modestly, but over
the years has grown into a ballpark with seven beautiful diamonds that are
maintained immaculately strictly by a dedicated group of volunteers. There are
three fields with lights, including one of the best softball fields in Indiana,
which, in recent years, was proud to host the Lady Greyhounds from the
University of Indianapolis as their home field. We also have a full service
concession stand staffed only by all volunteers.</p>
<p>ICLL has been very successful over
the years, winning many district titles in softball and baseball, as well as
several State Champion teams. We are proud to be a part of Little League
International, and proud to serve the families of our community.</p>
<p>Because ICLL is a private non-profit
organization, our funding is raised through sponsors, fundraisers and our
concession stand sales.  The operating budget is just over $50,000 per
year for the park and due to the cost of operating the facility, funds are
always tight.  When major expenses occur unexpectedly, our only option is
to pass the hat.  We are grateful to all of our sponsors and the
volunteers who have kept our parks open for over 60 years.  <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435110377/ykfas10uoocganmnjnsy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Last year, our 1985 John Deere 750
Tractor had an oil leak resulting in a thrown rod and bent crank shaft. 
We were unable to obtain funds over the winter and have spent the spring doing
the heavy lifting around our park by hand or with personal vehicles.  </p>
<p>We discovered Indiegogo a few months
ago and was encouraged by the generosity of donors around the world who care
about children, health and sports with the same passion as our Board Members, sponsors and volunteers.  We found a small shop in southern Indiana to
give us a detailed estimate of the repairs.  We
are going to have the repairs completed so that we can continue to maintain our
fields.  As a non-profit organization, our goal is to raise the entire amount for the repair
however; whatever you can give will go towards the repairs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><u>Estimate for JD 750:</u></b></p>
<p>Crankshaft – reground  $600 </p>
<p>Connecting rod $100</p>
<p>Ring, bearings, gaskets, valve job
$400</p>
<p>25 hours labor $1250</p>
<p>Total $2350</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once this tractor is repaired, the
volunteers who help keep our grounds looking good will be able to let the backs
start to heal.  </p>
<p>Thank you to all of those who consider
giving to our campaign.  In honor of those who do commit $25 or more
towards the repairs, ICLL will create a plaque to be displayed along side a picture of the repaired tractor with your name or organization name inscribed in a plate to memorialize your
generosity.  This plaque will be mounted and displayed permanently in the
concession area for all to see.  If your generosity exceeds our
expectations, the extra funds will go towards new equipment for our teams and
general expenditures.  <br/></p><p><b>All donations are tax deductible.</b><br/></p>

organization, our funding is raised through sponsors, fundraisers and our
concession stand sales.  The operating budget is just over $50,000 per
year for the park and due to the cost of operating the facility, funds are
always tight.  When major expenses occur unexpectedly, our only option is
to pass the hat.  We are grateful to all of our sponsors and the
volunteers who have kept our parks open for over 60 years.  
Last year, our 1985 John Deere 750
Tractor had an oil leak resulting in a thrown rod and bent crank shaft. 
We were unable to obtain funds over the winter and have spent the spring doing
the heavy lifting around our park by hand or with personal vehicles.  
We discovered Indiegogo a few months
ago and was encouraged by the generosity of donors around the world who care
about children, health and sports with the same passion as our Board Members, sponsors and volunteers.  We found a small shop in southern Indiana to
give us a detailed estimate of the repairs.  We
are going to have the repairs completed so that we can continue to maintain our
fields.  As a non-profit organization, our goal is to raise the entire amount for the repair
however; whatever you can give will go towards the repairs.

Estimate for JD 750:
Crankshaft – reground  $600 
Connecting rod $100
Ring, bearings, gaskets, valve job
$400
25 hours labor $1250
Total $2350

Once this tractor is repaired, the
volunteers who help keep our grounds looking good will be able to let the backs
start to heal.  
Thank you to all of those who consider
giving to our campaign.  In honor of those who do commit $25 or more
towards the repairs, ICLL will create a plaque to be displayed along side a picture of the repaired tractor with your name or organization name inscribed in a plate to memorialize your
generosity.  This plaque will be mounted and displayed permanently in the
concession area for all to see.  If your generosity exceeds our
expectations, the extra funds will go towards new equipment for our teams and
general expenditures.  All donations are tax deductible.
What you will receive:  
Little League Donor:  $1-$25
You will have the satisfaction of
knowing you are helping keep baseball alive in Central Indiana.
Major League Donor:  $25-$100
You will have the satisfaction of
knowing you are helping keep baseball alive in Central Indiana AND your name or
organizations name laser engraved on a custom ""Major League"" Donor
Plaque to be displayed permanently in the concession area for all to see along side a picture of the repaired tractor.
Hall of Fame Donor: $101-$500
You will have the satisfaction of
knowing you are helping keep baseball alive in Central Indiana AND your name or
organizations name laser engraved on a custom ""Hall of Fame"" Donor
Plaque to be displayed permanently in the concession area for all to see along side a picture of the repaired tractor.  We will announce all Hall of Fame
Donor's at the opening day Ceremony for the 2016 season.
Legend:  $35,000
As a legend, you will become an icon
at Indiana Central.  With $35,000 we will purchase a 2013 John Deere 4520
from our local John Deere dealer and have it repainted with Indiana Central's
colors and your name or your organization's name artfully air brushed on the
side.  Your name or organizations name will be memorialized in a plaque
with a picture of the painted tractor flanked by entire  2016 little
league players gathered around.  The tractor will lead the 2016 opening
day parade and a special presentation will be conducted on your behalf. 
If you are local or are willing to travel to our fields; we will include you in
the opening day ceremony.  
Other Ways You Can Help:
Sponsor a Child:  $76.00 
(This exact amount lets us know your
intentions)
If tractor repairs do not interest you,
we would like to provide the opportunity for you to donate to sponsor a boy
or girl to play baseball or softball in 2016.  There are many parents with children in
Central Indiana who could use a helping hand. 
Your donation will be discreetly distributed to families the Board of
Directors identifies as good candidates.
Sponsor a Family:  $130.00
(This exact amount lets us know your
intentions)
If tractor repairs do not interest you,
we would like to provide the opportunity for you to donate to sponsor a family
with two children to play baseball or softball in 2016.  There are many parents with children in
Central Indiana who could use a helping hand. 
Your donation will be discreetly distributed to families the Board of

<p> 1.  Smoke greener </p>
<p> 2.  Smoke as a catalyst to downgrade nicotine addiction</p>
<p>The most economical cigarette, the BILLYs cost $4 less than the national average of tobacco cigarettes and significantly less than electronic vaping.  In the most populated states like NY, CA, FL, WA, MA, TX, IL - the average savings is at around $9 a pack. That is a $90 in savings per a carton, for a green cigarette made only with green tea as the raw material.  </p>
<p>Compare cigarette prices and confirm that BILLYs will be saving smokers thousands, and hopefully help stop future cancer diagnosis of so many.  </p>
<p>We are committed to keep the retail price at $25 per a carton.</p>

<p>You can actually smoke the BILLY, and at the same time reduce tar, many carcinogenic byproducts, eliminate tobacco, eliminate nicotine, and use this product as a catalyst to stop being hurt by traditional cigarettes.  We even created a process to help guide you.  The BILLY process isn't easy and it takes about 90 days, but after the first 30 days it gets better and your brain will start to adapt, so if you want to know the process or familiarize it to help your friends, wife, husband, family or staff, here it is below:</p>

Created as the GREEN option in smoking, BILLYs is the only cigarette that gives you an option to keep smoking but greener, or smoke it as a catalyst to quit nicotine addiction. 

 1.  Smoke greener 
 2.  Smoke as a catalyst to downgrade nicotine addiction
The most economical cigarette, the BILLYs cost $4 less than the national average of tobacco cigarettes and significantly less than electronic vaping.  In the most populated states like NY, CA, FL, WA, MA, TX, IL - the average savings is at around $9 a pack. That is a $90 in savings per a carton, for a green cigarette made only with green tea as the raw material.  
Compare cigarette prices and confirm that BILLYs will be saving smokers thousands, and hopefully help stop future cancer diagnosis of so many.  
We are committed to keep the retail price at $25 per a carton.


                 


                                REGULAR                                                   MENTHOL                                                                        





You can actually smoke the BILLY, and at the same time reduce tar, many carcinogenic byproducts, eliminate tobacco, eliminate nicotine, and use this product as a catalyst to stop being hurt by traditional cigarettes.  We even created a process to help guide you.  The BILLY process isn't easy and it takes about 90 days, but after the first 30 days it gets better and your brain will start to adapt, so if you want to know the process or familiarize it to help your friends, wife, husband, family or staff, here it is below:
 
          


  


























                                         








NOT READY TO QUIT? 
Then, smoke cleaner and green with BILLYs...
                                               
                                                           PIONEER + AUTHENTIC







We at BILLYs will always preserve the right to smoke, smoke and be free...  












 
                      
Our stretch GOAL is at $50,000 - if we can hit this number we will introduce the BLACK TEA (BILLY 77s) variant option.  With a more bold taste, the BILLY BLACKS will not disappoint.",50.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Eliminate Marijuana Smoke &amp; Odors</h3>
<p>My friend Sean* smokes in a closet because he has family in the house.  They know he uses medical marijuana, but he doesn't want them breathing in the secondhand smoke.  One of my relatives, Anna, blows her smoke into a garbage bag, then takes all these garbage bags out to the woods behind her house to empty them.  Hector, a co-worker, smokes in the bathroom standing on the toilet so he can blow his smoke up the vent.  These are just a few of the people who inspired me to create the Purostat Exhale.  (*Names have been changed.)</p>
<h3>Make MM More Acceptable</h3>
<p>Research shows that smoking continues to be the most popular form of ingestion of medical marijuana.  Most smokers already have some method of controlling smoke on the inhale, such as a bong, a one-hitter, or a covered pipe.  The Purostat Exhale complements those devices by controlling smoke on the exhale.  The fact that so many people have been using ad-hoc solutions demonstrates the level of demand for this capability.  With our product, medical marijuana users will be able to smoke anywhere with no smell!</p>
<p>This is personal for me, because I'm a medical marijuana user myself and I live with someone who doesn't use it at all.  One of my missions in life is to address all the issues that non-users have about marijuana.  By supporting this campaign, you are helping make medical marijuana more acceptable to the rest of society!</p>
<h3>Where We Are &amp; What We Need</h3>
<p>At this point we have a working product that has undergone nearly a year of testing.  We also have our supply chain set up (see photos).  Now we need your help to get the word out and put the Purostat Exhale into the hands of America's 1.5 million medical marijuana users!  We are trying to raise $25,000, which breaks down like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>$15,000 in marketing expenses.  Our target audience consumes more traditional media than social media, so our campaign must include both.  For reference, a media buy in a well-known marijuana-related outlet costs about $3,000 to $10,000 per month.</li>
<li>$10,000 in production expenses.  We have a limited inventory that must be expanded to meet sales.  This will pay for 1,000 filters, mouthpieces, housings, and freight.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we'll produce fewer units and run a shorter campaign.  If we exceed our goal, we'll produce more and run longer.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>No matter what you contribute, you get our commitment to keep you informed about the effect we're having.  Our goal is to bring cleaner air to the medical marijuana community.  With your help, we are going to do it one Exhale at a time!  If you can't help financially, you can always click ""share"" or tell your friends about our campaign.</p>
<p>Any contribution of $25 or more will get you a Purostat Exhale, or a 4-Pack if you contribute $79 or more.  If you're raring to get one right now, there are a limited number of units with inventor's signature available for $59.  For those who want to be involved in the design process, you can get your favorite colors put on the next model of the Purostat Exhale for $279.  And for those who are interested in starting and running a web business, I will share what I've learned with you for $579.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>At this point, we've gotten over most of the hurdles.  The only remaining risk is that we might not reach enough of our potential customers.  It's a marketing challenge.  Fortunately, I have a background in marketing, and this is a product that I use and believe in.  The Purostat Exhale works.  There is a growing market of people who need what it does.  The challenge is to identify those people and make them aware of our product.</p>
<p>This entails advertising in both traditional and social media.  Once we've generated a certain level of awareness, sales from the website are expected to cover the costs of future advertising.  But to get that started, we need investment.  As I've been going around the country talking to people about the Purostat Exhale, I've been surprised by the level of interest from ordinary people who never invested in a startup before.  That's why I thought Indiegogo would be the perfect place to seek support.</p>
<div>
<h3>My Background</h3>
<p>I have a background in design, psychology, and marketing, including two stints at Harvard.  I've been building and inventing things my whole life, but I didn't understand the business side of it until I started working in Silicon Valley in 2007.  I founded Purostat in 2015 with a mission to make medical marijuana more accessible and more acceptable.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>I'm Sending Out an S.O.S.</u></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>(Save Orthodontic Smiles)</u></h2>
<p>My name is Dr. Salvatore DeRicco, and I've been frustrated by my orthodontic patients' inability to prevent <i>permanent</i> and <i>unsightly </i> decalcifications (""White Spot Lesions""), cavities, and swollen gums - around their braces, for over 25 years!  All sorts of toothbrushes, paint-on products, pastes, gels, and rinses - while steps in the right direction, have ultimately proven inadequate.  But I <i>finally </i> figured out that the product orthodontic patients need, didn't EXIST!  So I <i>invented </i> it!! </p>
<p><strong>Here is an image of teeth with moderate decalcifications/White Spot Lesions, following orthodontic treatment - notice that the lesions are primarily concentrated at the backs/bases of the braces - where they meet the enamel, and upwards - to the gumline:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502677796/bdlsammhainzqh3cadag.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>And here is a severe case of decalcification - occurring in the same, typical regions, and including a major cavity:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502679322/syc7qsli8fy6j924qbso.jpg"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>Research has proven that up to 97% of patients with braces will incur some degree of decalcification on one or more teeth, during their time in orthodontic treatment.  This statistic is STAGGERING!!  And the reason is that braces serve as ""plaque traps"" (a common term) - for food debris, and then ""plaque canopies"" (my term) - for the trapped debris, by inhibiting conventional toothbrushes and even ""orthodontic toothbrushes"" from reaching the plaque, by virtue of the designs of the braces and the inadequately-designed toothbrushes.  The SONIC ORTHODONTIC Toothbrush does two things to solve this problem - first, it is designed with only ONE single row of bristles - to fit BEHIND braces - into the very regions where the plaque gets trapped and ""sheltered"" (as in the next image) , and its SONIC VIBRATIONS (31,000 per minute!) serve to loosen the plaque, so it may be swept away!  It's a very simple mechanical concept, which has eluded orthodontists and orthodontic patients, alike, for more than a CENTURY!</p>
<p><strong>Here is the ""money shot"" of why this toothbrush is so effective at cleansing the areas where decalcification occurs - ALL of its bristles fit BEHIND all braces, including the obstructive hooks for rubber bands, too!:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502668921/fhdz1z8xkxxyeexyv0rd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In the U.S., alone, it is estimated that 8 million children and adults are wearing braces at any given time.  Contributing to this campaign, and, therefore, the ultimate production of The SONIC ORTHODONTIC Toothbrush, can help them <i>all</i>  reduce their potential to develop this unsightly permanent damage to their teeth!  And if you multiply that by the number of patients who will have braces in the future - for decades to come, and those in the rest of the world, too, together, we can have a<i> tremendous  </i>impact on the future dental health of the WORLD, ultimately affecting BILLIONS of teeth!  McDonalds prides themselves on having ""Billions Sold"", but we will have <strong>""Billions Saved""</strong>!!</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Our Needs and Your Rewards</u></h2>
<p>The molds for the toothbrush heads and handles have already been built, and we (my plant and I) are seeking to raise $13,700 for the final phase of production of the first lot of SONIC ORTHODONTIC Toothbrushes.  As rewards for your contribution, we are offering ""Our most heartfelt thanks"" and <i>deep</i>  discounts on SONIC ORTHODONTIC Toothbrushes.  The toothbrushes will retail - online, at $68 (plus shipping), and will include two <i>patented </i> orthodontic brush heads, two standard (non-orthodontic) brush heads - for other family members, and/or after orthodontic treatment is complete, one sonic handle, one electric charger base, and one owner's manual.  For our contributors who donate $48 (plus shipping), they will receive one SONIC ORTHODONTIC Toothbrush; those who donate $80 (plus shipping) will receive two; and those who donate $105 (plus shipping) will receive three.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>We've covered all the BASES; please help us cover all the BRACES!</u></h2>

</div></div>","I'm Sending Out an S.O.S.
(Save Orthodontic Smiles)
My name is Dr. Salvatore DeRicco, and I've been frustrated by my orthodontic patients' inability to prevent permanent and unsightly  decalcifications (""White Spot Lesions""), cavities, and swollen gums - around their braces, for over 25 years!  All sorts of toothbrushes, paint-on products, pastes, gels, and rinses - while steps in the right direction, have ultimately proven inadequate.  But I finally  figured out that the product orthodontic patients need, didn't EXIST!  So I invented  it!! 
Here is an image of teeth with moderate decalcifications/White Spot Lesions, following orthodontic treatment - notice that the lesions are primarily concentrated at the backs/bases of the braces - where they meet the enamel, and upwards - to the gumline:

And here is a severe case of decalcification - occurring in the same, typical regions, and including a major cavity:
 
Research has proven that up to 97% of patients with braces will incur some degree of decalcification on one or more teeth, during their time in orthodontic treatment.  This statistic is STAGGERING!!  And the reason is that braces serve as ""plaque traps"" (a common term) - for food debris, and then ""plaque canopies"" (my term) - for the trapped debris, by inhibiting conventional toothbrushes and even ""orthodontic toothbrushes"" from reaching the plaque, by virtue of the designs of the braces and the inadequately-designed toothbrushes.  The SONIC ORTHODONTIC Toothbrush does two things to solve this problem - first, it is designed with only ONE single row of bristles - to fit BEHIND braces - into the very regions where the plaque gets trapped and ""sheltered"" (as in the next image) , and its SONIC VIBRATIONS (31,000 per minute!) serve to loosen the plaque, so it may be swept away!  It's a very simple mechanical concept, which has eluded orthodontists and orthodontic patients, alike, for more than a CENTURY!
Here is the ""money shot"" of why this toothbrush is so effective at cleansing the areas where decalcification occurs - ALL of its bristles fit BEHIND all braces, including the obstructive hooks for rubber bands, too!:

In the U.S., alone, it is estimated that 8 million children and adults are wearing braces at any given time.  Contributing to this campaign, and, therefore, the ultimate production of The SONIC ORTHODONTIC Toothbrush, can help them all  reduce their potential to develop this unsightly permanent damage to their teeth!  And if you multiply that by the number of patients who will have braces in the future - for decades to come, and those in the rest of the world, too, together, we can have a tremendous  impact on the future dental health of the WORLD, ultimately affecting BILLIONS of teeth!  McDonalds prides themselves on having ""Billions Sold"", but we will have ""Billions Saved""!!
 
Our Needs and Your Rewards
The molds for the toothbrush heads and handles have already been built, and we (my plant and I) are seeking to raise $13,700 for the final phase of production of the first lot of SONIC ORTHODONTIC Toothbrushes.  As rewards for your contribution, we are offering ""Our most heartfelt thanks"" and deep  discounts on SONIC ORTHODONTIC Toothbrushes.  The toothbrushes will retail - online, at $68 (plus shipping), and will include two patented  orthodontic brush heads, two standard (non-orthodontic) brush heads - for other family members, and/or after orthodontic treatment is complete, one sonic handle, one electric charger base, and one owner's manual.  For our contributors who donate $48 (plus shipping), they will receive one SONIC ORTHODONTIC Toothbrush; those who donate $80 (plus shipping) will receive two; and those who donate $105 (plus shipping) will receive three.
 
We've covered all the BASES; please help us cover all the BRACES!
The manual (non-sonic) precursor to The SONIC ORTHODONTIC Toothbrush - named The SPOT LESS BRUSH, has been available for two years, (www.Spotless-Smiles.com) and has helped many thousands of orthodontic patients, all over the world.  Adding the sonic vibration was the only possible way to improve on an already effective and successful product, and the logical evolution, in its further development.  We look forward to partnering with you on the development of this even more  revolutionary orthodontic hygiene product!

the possibility to use the chemokine in human; our needs are in the range of

The ""Semi Colon"" tattoo worn by tens of thousands of our members represents the fact that ""the story is not over"" ; there is life after and during any mental illness or challenge.
The ""SEMI COLON MOVEMENT""  is a world wide movement; our web site will cater to Canada (and the world).  Currently there is no Semi Colon Group in Canada & we need one.
We offer advise to people that have healed and people that are healing.  That advice will include : legal, fitness, medication, crisis, employment, nutrition 
We need to raise enough money to launch and maintain a networking web site that will allow people to blog about their experiences and share healing advice.

We are open to all faiths and do not wish to profit except to reward the people who maintain the web sight. We appreciate the ""free"" offers that have been offered but I believe to do justice to such an important cause someone needs to be compensated accordingly. 
We will also offer free services to anyone in need of guidance to achieve wellness.
We do not want to make a profit but will branch out to fund raising events such as art exhibits to help anyone who is healing or has healed from any mental challenge. I am an open book, please feel free to see :

spirited group of athletes who do not let their disabilities get in the way of
competing to earn the title of tournament champions. They work hard and they
play hard. Wheelchair basketball not only gives them an opportunity to improve
their athletic skills, but allows them to experience being part of a team, and
as any of them will tell you, increases their self-confidence both on and off
the court.</p>
<p>

<p><b>Up to this point, the athletes have been playing

the teams in the league.</b> We believe jerseys will add to the players’ excitement
and enjoyment of the game. These uniforms will foster a sense of team unity and
belonging. We imagine the level of competition will increase because when our
athletes look like champions, they’re going to play like champions.
Additionally, fan supporters will be able to more easily identify and cheer for
their teams, encouraging and motivating their favorite players.</p>
<p>In order to supply each participant with a reversible jersey,
we are looking to raise a total of $4,215 includes design, shipping and handling. Won’t you consider supporting these young men and women by making a

I’m a 21 year old student of Education majoring in English. I was born with a proximal femoral deficiency of the lower left limb, which means that my left leg didn’t develop properly during my gestation process, resulting in me being born with one leg shorter than the other which had a foot with three tiny toes on it. Despite this, the condition never posed an obstacle and I have been able to lead a normal life as well a sweet childhood surrounded by both family and friends.

I took on my first orthoprothesis when I was only 11 months old. The support and patience my family provided made it so I learned to walk without any help after a while. They have been with me since the very beginning and their support and love has always been present. I grew happily and changed my prosthetic leg from time to time until I became 11 years old. That year, during my annual check up, my doctor realized that my left foot was growing too fast. These were bad news, because the growth meant that soon I wouldn’t be able to walk with a prosthetic.Up came a solution, an amputation. My parents did everything they could to make it possible and it finally came through. I honestly can’t say that it was easy for me (an 11 year old girl) to withstand the pain and complications that came post surgery. After three months of recovery, we tried once again contemplating the use a prosthetic leg, but unfortunately at that given time we couldn’t afford a new one.I soon learned to walk by aiding myself with crutches, it was rough at first but after a year I got used to it and became very fast with them! Throughout the years I was focused on school and aiming to get excellent grades (which I did). I have always loved foreign languages, so I took an English course during my senior year of high school. When I got to graduate from high school (back in 2010) I soon realized that my passion was helping people, as well teaching them how to communicate in a foreign language.
In order to support my family, at the age of 16, I started working for an important newspaper as soon as I graduated from high school. My days were spent half time working and the other half going to college.As you can see, I’m just an ordinary young woman with a not so ordinary condition that has never represented a limitation. Nowadays, after 10 years of using crutches I want to change my lifestyle once again, simply go back to using a prosthetic leg and together with my college degree, seeking the promise of a better future where I can do more things than I already do.Even then, it’s been so long since I last wore prosthesis so my muscles have become weak. This is the reason I need rehab prior to using prosthesis once again. The process would start as soon as possible and there is a high chance that by the time I get my college degree (July, 2016) I could be walking again, which is very exciting for me and represents the beginning of the new life that awaits me and I’ve been yearning for!
What We Need & the PossibilitiesThe funds obtained with this campaign will be used in several ways. One of them would be the payment of my physical therapies which are needed throughout then entire process. The second one and most important is the purchase of the materials needed in order to build my prosthetic leg in my country. After speaking with my technician (Richard Rosales, who has been with me through this whole journey), he suggested several parts such as the knee 3R95 found in Ottobock (which can be found in several places around the world but are not present in Venezuela). This would imply that the expenses include shipping of every single part since both the building of the prosthesis and therapy will be done here, in my country. This remains my one and only option because they’re simply not available where I currently reside.
All the funds raised by this campaign will go towards the purchase of my prosthetic leg and my rehabilitation process but in the event of raising more than we initially needed (considering this is an approximate), I plan to donate the money to an organization in charge of helping people in situations such as mine to help bring a solution to their lives.The ImpactI’m a very proactive person who is always willing to help. My sole goal in life is to continue growing academically after my college graduation so I can be prepared to give my very best to all my future students. Having the opportunity to improve the quality of my life by using once again a prosthetic leg gives me hope and an optimist outlook towards everything that awaits me in the future. At the same time, I have been dealing with health issues due to the extended use and pressure I put on my right leg, which results in terrible back pain among others and hinders my daily life as well my productivity.With your assistance I can come through all of this and I would definitely lead a life that will change in every possible way towards something better. I’ll be more than willing to share this journey with these wanting to keep in contact and follow my progress and at the same time I will be more than happy to get to know some of the generous people who have decided to help me make my dream come true.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you’re financially unable to aid me, you can still help by sharing my story and campaign with everyone you can! Spreading the word does a lot by itself and it will definitely help me out in my journey. Any way you want, through any social media, I will gladly appreciate it.Anything goes! Please spread the word and bring light to my life once again!-Dani",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Hi, we are a small Startup from India, and together with Novamem in Switzerland we are bringing clean and portable water to India.</div>
<div>With our portable water filters - DrinkPure - anyone in India can purify water on the spot. They are save, durable, and can used many many times. </div>
<div>We want to produce these filter very affordable, locally in India and distribute them. </div>
<div>As it is important to us to help people who can still not afford these filter, we are giving the DrinkPures funded by this campaign for free to kids in local, public schools, where is no access to clean drinking water. </div>

<div><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></div>
</div><div> <p>What we have to do, in order to produce the filters, is:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to order some machines (a welding and a cutting machine)</li>
<li>We need to hire some people who work the machines and help us with marketing and distribution</li>
<li>We need to order all the single parts</li>
<li>We have to make sure many people hear about the filters and get convinced that the filters actually work</li> </ul>
<div>In order for this to be done, we need around 20.000 $. As more money we can invest, as more parts we can order and as cheaper every single filter will be in the end. </div>
<div>In return for a contribution, you can help kids in public schools here, or there are also options for you to get your very own filter and see how awesome it works. </div>
<div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>How does it work? Is it magic? Are you wizards?</h3>
<div>Nah, it's much easier. In the filter are multiple filtration layers. The most important one is a membrane, developed by the ETH Zurich and the spin-off Novamem. You can imagine it like a plastic foil, with tiny tiny holes in it, just a few nano meters. And everything that is bigger than this mesh will stay out, while the water can flow through. So you get clean, safe water. Due to the novel and high performance membrane, the filter can be very small and operated with just a little bit of pressure, a hand-squeeze is just enough go get a nice flow rate. And once too much dirt accumulates on the membrane, it is simply washed back and as good as new!</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>India is currently facing a huge water crisis. There are 97 million people in India without access to improved drinking water and over <a href=""http://www.ananthapuri.com/article.asp?title=Water-Problem-in-India&amp;id=48"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">21% of the country's diseases are water-related</a>. That means a lot of people getting sick every day, and a lot of people at still dying every day, just due to bad drinking water. </div>
<div>We want to give people a tool, to filter their own water, reliable and cost-efficient. Without being dependent on energy or regular deliveries of chemicals, or skilled personal to operate heavy machines. </div>
<div>And we also want to give NGO's or companies an easy opportunity, to quickly boost the standard of living for as many people as they want, by simply providing these simple and easy-to-use-filters to them. </div>

<p>Thank you for checking in on my page.  My spiritual name is
Luna Phoenix.  Luna, Spanish for Moon, is not only to signify my Spanish
heritage but also my sense of humor for teaching nude yoga.  It also
signifies my dedication to you.  The Moon reflects the Light from the Sun
to shine upon the Earth.  My job is to be the reflection of light that is
shown upon me from you. I make it my goal to reflect the light in all who I
meet.  Phoenix reflects my life.  I have been down many times in my
life and risen again from the ashes brighter and stronger than before. I am the

as well as a Registered Yoga Alliance Certified Yoga Instructor.  I hold a
Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do and a Brown belt in Chung Do Kwan.  Currently, I
am studying to obtain my Reiki Master certification.  </span></p>
<p>I teach yoga in both
clothed and unclothed formats.  My nude yoga helps individuals to enhance the
union of the spiritual, emotional and physical plane in a naturist/nudist state
using an unmasking ceremony.  We see nudity as a natural state not as a
sexual being.  We peel off the mayas (illusions) of the identity we place
on ourselves to return us back to the original state.  I teach the nude
yoga to remove the sexual stigma on the naked body.  Here in NuReveal
Yoga, we work hard to change the culture into accepting the nude body as a
protective shell of a Spiritual being.<i> <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I love YOGA
and I love what it has done for me in regards to confidence, self image,

<p>The patented 'Light Modulation' technology used, has been developed over a period of many years by Anadi A. Martel; Physicist, Inventor and Electronics Wizard.  After establishing a solid scientific foundation through his Graduate studies in Physics, he went on to live in an ashram in India for a few years.</p>
<p>Since then, he has been applying his knowledge of electronics and computers to the development of instruments working in novel ways with sound and light. His Spatial Sound Processors have been used worldwide by professionals in psychoacoustics, multimedia, and cinema. His work has led to patents in the field of Light Modulation, and recently in LED-based design. He has worked as a hi-tech design consultant for various companies such as Disney World, Cirque du Soleil, Imax and OSIM International and continues his work on Sensora Systems and SensoSphere along with his other professional products. He is also president of the International Light Association. He will be releasing his new Book entitled “The Power of Light” The Dawn of a New Medicine.</p>
<p>A therapist well-known both in Canada and abroad from working with Tantra and Shamanism, <strong>Ma Premo</strong> is the co-creator of the Sensora multi-sensorial system. Using these unique light and sound instruments, she has over the last 30 years built up a wealth of experience in helping people. She has been leading transformational and meditation groups and trainings around the world and has also participated in numerous international projects, including live shows, and art and museum installations, as a consultant and facilitator.<br/> <br/>Ma Premo has developed a unique way of using light for integrative therapy, focusing on colors’ innate abilities to evoke pure joy and delight, thereby stimulating the brain’s flow of pleasure-related neurotransmitters. This approach contributes to restoring inner homeostasis, an essential component of the healing process in areas as varied as depression, burn-out, PTSD, insomnia, chronic pain, anxiety, addiction and more.</p>

<p>There are many skeptics to any form of alternative medicine and therapy that is not based on pharma solutions. However, there are many signs that non-invasive therapy is gaining a lot of attention around the world. Since 2000, we have seen increases in the thousands of scientific medical articles on Light Therapy. In 2010 alone, there were over 8000 articles mentioning or referring to light. Today, there are many companies and products within this therapeutic field that are designed to treat various conditions related to health.</p>
<p>We are now being exposed to the multiple benefits of Light Therapy in all forms of media. For all those seeking to understand how our Chromotherapy works, we have created a video collection referred to as <strong>Therapeutic Applications of Light</strong> that can be found here. It is scientific, but I encourage you to view the history of light and the science community behind the progress.</p>

The Beginning of SensoSphere

The patented 'Light Modulation' technology used, has been developed over a period of many years by Anadi A. Martel; Physicist, Inventor and Electronics Wizard.  After establishing a solid scientific foundation through his Graduate studies in Physics, he went on to live in an ashram in India for a few years.
Since then, he has been applying his knowledge of electronics and computers to the development of instruments working in novel ways with sound and light. His Spatial Sound Processors have been used worldwide by professionals in psychoacoustics, multimedia, and cinema. His work has led to patents in the field of Light Modulation, and recently in LED-based design. He has worked as a hi-tech design consultant for various companies such as Disney World, Cirque du Soleil, Imax and OSIM International and continues his work on Sensora Systems and SensoSphere along with his other professional products. He is also president of the International Light Association. He will be releasing his new Book entitled “The Power of Light” The Dawn of a New Medicine.
A therapist well-known both in Canada and abroad from working with Tantra and Shamanism, Ma Premo is the co-creator of the Sensora multi-sensorial system. Using these unique light and sound instruments, she has over the last 30 years built up a wealth of experience in helping people. She has been leading transformational and meditation groups and trainings around the world and has also participated in numerous international projects, including live shows, and art and museum installations, as a consultant and facilitator. Ma Premo has developed a unique way of using light for integrative therapy, focusing on colors’ innate abilities to evoke pure joy and delight, thereby stimulating the brain’s flow of pleasure-related neurotransmitters. This approach contributes to restoring inner homeostasis, an essential component of the healing process in areas as varied as depression, burn-out, PTSD, insomnia, chronic pain, anxiety, addiction and more.
 
Technology Behind SensoSphere


There are many skeptics to any form of alternative medicine and therapy that is not based on pharma solutions. However, there are many signs that non-invasive therapy is gaining a lot of attention around the world. Since 2000, we have seen increases in the thousands of scientific medical articles on Light Therapy. In 2010 alone, there were over 8000 articles mentioning or referring to light. Today, there are many companies and products within this therapeutic field that are designed to treat various conditions related to health.
We are now being exposed to the multiple benefits of Light Therapy in all forms of media. For all those seeking to understand how our Chromotherapy works, we have created a video collection referred to as Therapeutic Applications of Light that can be found here. It is scientific, but I encourage you to view the history of light and the science community behind the progress.
These videos are presented by Physicist Anadi Martel. Your understanding of the technology described as ‘Light Modulation’ used in SensoSphere is important to gain confidence in the use of our device. Chromotherapy (Color Light Therapy)Color Light Therapy, or Chromotherapy, is a recognized therapeutic method that has been used for centuries to help cure diseases and relieve ailments (Azeemi and Raza, 2005). The effects of light on the human body include influence on the brain’s visual cortex (i.e. perception and consciousness), influence on our hormonal system, as well as a deep influence on the circadian, neuroendocrine, and on neurobehavioral regulation (Anadi A. Martel, 2015). Moreover, light penetrates within the skin rather than only touching the surface, and thus influences cellular biochemistry (Anadi A. Martel, 2015). Research on ChromotherapyAnadi A.

 Light ModulationThe important principle of SensoSphere, one of multiple, that  separates our product from other Color Light Therapy technologies, is Sensortech Inc.’s patented ‘Light Modulation’ technology. This system allows the embedding of soft light pulsations for specific interaction with our various physiological rhythms, such as brainwaves, breath, and heartbeat. Clinical Study on 'Light Modulation'A clinical study on the effects of colored light projections based on Sensortech’s Light Modulation technology, as used in SensoSphere, was published in 2013 by Dr. M.J. Ross, Dr. P. Guthrie (Midwestern State University, Texas, USA), and J.C. Dumont (Trinity Western University, BC, Canada) in Advances in Mind & Body Medicine Journal. The Impact of Modulated, Colored Light on the Autonomic Nervous System: A detailed report can be acquired through Advances in Mind-Body medicine journal, reference to Fall 2013 Vol 27 No4.

<h2>The MISIG Story </h2>
<p>We started shipping the MISIG April, 2016 and as writing this there are 61 PGA, LPGA and PGA Champions Tour Professionals using the MISIG and one of the things your donation will do is help secure sponsorship deals.

</div><p>My name is Bernie Fay and I am the Inventor of the MISIG or ""Most Important Stretch In Golf."" It's a simple yet profound device that really helps golfers of all ages and skill levels. I invented it out of desperation. You see when I was 12 years old I broke my humerus bone (bone between shoulder and elbow) and today it is very arthritic. Because of this I had lost my back swing. I kept trying to figure out what could help me get that back.</p><p>Just over a year ago,  I was in my garage stretching my left arm when I spotted a bungee cord on a work bench. Ever the inquisitive experimenter, I tied the cord to my elbow and started pulling it up and away from my body. It was a fantastic stretch.  I soon began thinking about how to develop what I just discovered into a better functioning system of stretching and turning.</p><p>After a dozen trips to the hardware store and numerous purchases of stretch cords and other parts from the internet, I created a rather unsightly prototype.

I continued tweaking the design, and a few months after this eureka moment in the garage, I applied for a patent.
