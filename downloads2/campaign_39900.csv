</div>","About My Project (And Me!)
My experience at TIDE

            This Project began in Dec 2012. I
came to TIDE to get work experience in conservation and my experience has
exceeded every expectation I had prior to coming to Belize. This project, to
me, is fascinating. It has challenged me to learn faster than I ever thought
imaginable and exposed me to methodologies that I would never have thought I could
even comprehend, let alone implement. It has inspired me to put all of the
information I've been devouring for the last seven months to use by not just
stating the obvious, that something needs to be done to improve solid waste
management in many developing countries, but using my study to actually make a
difference.
What I’m doing:

           The purpose of my research is to find
out if this immense open dump site (one of the largest in the country), located
in the middle of a wetland jungle, is impacting the nearby Rio Grande river
(also one of the largest in the country) and the species within. Five species that
are  accessible at all my sites on the river, known to
bioaccumulate, and are a common food source to humans and so may pose a health
risk, will be tested for the following contaminants:                                         Organic pollutants: Nitrogen: In the form of
ammonia ((NH3-), ammonium 

















(NH4+), nitrite (NO2−
),
nitrate Phosphate 
(PO3-4). Heavy metals: Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe), Nickel (Ni), Manganese (Mn) Cadmium (Cd), Lead (Pb), Copper  (Cu), Chromium (Cr), Mercury (Hg). Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP’s): Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB’s), Phenols. 



And finally, stable isotope
analysis of nitrogen
(δ15N) and carbon (δ13C), tested
on the same species, will prove that any contaminants found are from the dump
site and not outside sources (see my video for a fun explanation of this! or,
if your truly interested in the science, see my project summary!)
So what!? Outcomes of this Research:

Results from this project will
be used:
-
By the Solid Waste Management Authority of Belize to advocate for relocation of
this dump site to a more suitable location and to inform appropriate
restoration strategies.
-
By local environmental and social organizations to develop initiatives to
reduce municipal waste in the first place by composting and UpCycling.
 ‘Something
From Nothing’: I’ve been
called a gypsy many times in my life by close friends. I am resourceful,
artistic, and I have an inert ability to create ‘Something From Nothing’. For Every 300$ Donated to This Project  I will do just that, take a dent out of the mountains
of plastic bottles that are cast away at the Rio Grande dump site, and UpCycle them into bottle bins to be placed around town, providing an alternative to
current practices of disposing of waste in old fridges, cardboard boxes, in
bags on the sides of the street, or in the ocean.  (See my creation below!)
I also plan on attempting a

<p>Here is another link about the Tar Sands Healing walk that has newly been established:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.healingwalk.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.healingwalk.org/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>$1.00 is all I ask.<br/><br/>I'd like ... LOVE...to be a part of this. Would you be willing to sponsor me? If you are unable to, is there anyone you know who has a small business/local company that wants to be advertised as being a part of positive CHANGE that would be willing to sponsor me? I can get it covered on film with images &amp; videos, blog updates, and with luck and stealth manners, perhaps even broadcasted on the news and radio.<br/><br/>Below is a list of any expenditures involved. Perhaps you know enough people in your network that have a minimal amount to give, the faith that I can make a difference through this movement, and the desire to be involved without having the time. I wish to be a vessel for all of you that care, to be the messenger, to be the puppet that can speak to an audience, while most of you are hindered by your careers and priorities. Let me be your catalyst. Give me your words, thoughts, and opinions...Consider me your voice.<br/><br/>One dollar from each of you, could well send me on my way to walking within the realms of the Tar Sands' corruption. This healing walk will enable me to grasp a clearer picture, first hand, of the detrimental effects this pit in Canada has produced. It will guide my energy toward healing the TarSands Pipeline Project. This Tar Sand pit has already damaged many water reservoirs, ruined ecosystems for an indeterminable time, damaged the food chain affecting not only humans but thousands of wild species as well, and is on the way to polluting not just the wildlife in Canada, but much of the soil and water systems in America as well. The repercussions go much farther than that, and I am ready to give resources as well as layman's terms and/or answers to any questions you have regarding this issue.<br/><br/>ONE DOLLAR. It is worth nothing to you today. Perhaps an item made in China at the Dollar Store...perhaps a roll of toilet paper...perhaps, if you're lucky, a convenient beverage...But to me...to me it is worth an invaluable amount. Were I to receive this amount from each of you, just imagine the difference I could make for you...I IMPLORE you to imagine! With a life story behind me that shows nothing of ill promise, I survived. I am here for ALL of you. To do do the work of every one of you who is incapable of the time, the money, the passion, the resistance to society which so many of you feel in your heart, but are afraid to act upon. 1 dollar. $1.00 can set you free and make a world of difference.<br/><br/>Will you help me to help us all?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>A little more about me:</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Diana April, I'm 33 years old and a single mother of a 12 year old son. Both my son and I have been part of numerous campaigns...including, but not limited to, the iMatter March, Green-Up Day Vermont (multiple times!), 350VT &amp; 350.org movements, as well as Vermont Workers' Rights campaigns.</p>
<p>Beyond the spotlighted events, we live a lifestyle that most would bawk at (feel free to use some of these ideas if you wish!):</p>
<p>~we do our laundry in the tub and hang it to dry in the kitchen, saving gallons of water, and kilowatts of electricity, not to mention money...</p>
<p>~without a lawn to plant a garden, we've collected upcycled containers to plant our own lush garden in on our three-season porch, including using cleaned out containers from food purchases, such as soup and coffee cans, strawberry containers, old wooden crates, and even hummus containers.</p>
<p>~we buy our (as much as we can) non-GMO organic food in bulk, bake our own bread, and store the bulk food in old glass containers - such as pickle and baby food jars.</p>
<p>~almost every peice of furniture in our home has been a used item before we acquired them. Each peice was either gifted to us in exchange for labor, found via thrift stores, or things we've put together ourselves with a little elbow grease and some screws.</p>
~we both ride bicycles in exchange for having a car. This does cause us many challenges regarding visiting relatives and friends, but we decided that renting or borrowing a friend's car and visiting far less often not only saves carbon emissions and money, but also makes the time we do spend with our loved ones that much more incredible.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>~we no longer purchase plastic products and are slowly seeding them out of our lifestyle (which is no way easy and is taking a LOT of time!), but what we do already have in house, such as plastic baggies, we wash and re-use when we need to -which really isn't that often...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>~we've switched to cleaning products that are either environmentally friendly (such as Seventh Generation dishwashing liquid) or made from staples in our kitchen - baking soda as toothpaste, although it can be abrasive so we only use it every other day, as a facial and hair cleanser, and vinegar as a hair rinse, household cleaner, and fruit fly attractant.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>~instead of purchasing many household items, we scour the internet for inspiration on how to create our own, instead of feeding the consumerism. Some examples? -We needed a toilet paper holder, and didn't want to buy a plastic one (which was the most affordable version), so we upcycled a wire clothing hanger into a holder that holds up to three rolls at a time! -We were at odds with how to hold our spice containers without a rack, but found an old CD holder at a thrift shop and refashioned it to hold the bottles of spices. Many more examples, but I won't bore you!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>~we make all of our gifts. They may not be the flat screen TV my son wanted for Christmas, nor were they brand-name clothes, but in making our gifts, we find the real meaning of gifting, we save the stress of holiday crowds, recycle paper goods, and find that the recipients find them ever more precious than the impersonal gift certificate.</div>
<div> </div>

<h3>A Little More Personal</h3>
<div>I grew up knowing that something wasn't panning out right with the earth; that one day we were going to have to deal with things that we'd been turning the other cheek to for a long long time. I doubt that I was ever ""educated"" formally on the topic of climate change; a lot of it I learned through lectures, reading, and speaking with others who shared the same ideas that the earth was in trouble. I reached my twenties that I began looking into nutrition and the engineering of food and pesticide use...I went to the market one day to find an apple as big as a grapefruit and it clicked with me that, ""Oh, my...this just isn't right!"" The issues with fruits and vegetables led me to the knowledge of factory farming and what animals were being subjected to within them. Once I had a grasp on that, the repercussions of the altered food chain led me to the environmental issues. I researched on my own, absorbing so much information I literally made myself sick. I remember crying over it all...feeling hopeless, helpless, incapable and also part of the problem. I'd express these feelings to my loved ones who would look at me and say, ""You can't take this on your shoulders, Diana, you are just one person! This is just the way it is."" </div>
<div> </div>
<div>But I had a son. A very young son at the time, and I was determined to make sure he was aware of the world he was going to be faced with if we all just sat back and said, ""this is just the way it is."" And in no way was I going to prepare him for these problems without setting an example for him on how to take small steps to fixing, or at least slowing down the acceleration of, climate change.</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The amount of funding I'm looking for will be ongoing. There are many climate-related projects that call for activism upcoming this year, as well as further into the future, especially as the climate situation gets worse. My funding needs are specifically for travel and lodging expenses, and for each venture, an itinerary of expenditures will be listed. I can handle my own nourishment, and all other necessities, as I have a tent, backpack, and sleeping bag if the funds for a hostel room or cheap motel do not become available in time. I'm not afraid to sleep outside but if that's the case, it would be nice to have some funding in order to wash up at a local YMCA or similar establishment. Any questions will be answered as fully as possible. Right now, I imagine that lodging per night will cost between $50-$100 per night, depending on the location of the project. Please, keep in mind, that if a campground is nearby, I will choose that option first, and assume that the lodging expense for that will be under the above predicted amount. Travel expenses vary with each venture, as ideally, carpooling or traveling via bus or train is the most logical route. Train tickets can cost upwards of $100 one way, depending on the destination, and bus fare can be cheaper if bought in advance (anywhere from $10 to $200 - one way OR round trip). Carpooling would require that I find another activist with a spare seat, and would require gas money (again, that would vary depending on the destination), or renting an economy size vehicle and packing in as many other folks who want to be a part of it as well. Renting can be efficient, although there may be stipulations regarding mileage and insurance rates. Currently, I can rent from Enterprise for about $60 a day, including the necessary insurance and unlimited miles. I do have a membership with them and they have been very good about giving me discounts as I earn points.</p>
<p>Access to a power supply is obviously pertinent to this cause, as I intend to keep you all up to date with blogs and photos as soon as time permits. If internet access is available via a free wifi site, that will be my first choice (such as a coffee shop or local library), but there is a chance that I will have to pay for a connection to upload photos and publish blogs during the travels and usually this cost is about $5-15 an hour. I have my own laptop and camera, as well as a memory card and extra bettery, so I do not expect to use any money towards that endeavor. </p>
<p>If I could sum up an estimated amount for each venture, I would say a minimum of $150 to a maximum of $600 for each activism project.</p>
<p>While on these ventures, I encourage you to read the blogs I'll be posting during each project. I have extensive writing skills and experience, and hope to keep you informed as well as entertained to the best of my abilities. Please note that some of these activism ventures can be quite emotional, and often there are little dramas that add to the intensity of the story. Upon returning home from each traverse, a reflective and conclusive post will be published as well.</p>
<p>Any funds that have been collected over my goal will be placed aside for future activist projects. If any goals are not met, I will still try to meet the end goal and pay out of pocket in order to be a catalyst for change. If the money simply isn't available, the funds will be rolled over into the next activism endeavor's fundraising effort, and you will be notified as to wha that endeavor is, in order for you to be refunded if you do not supprt it, or (hopefully) continue to have it remain in the fund for the upcoming activism.</p>
<p>By reading the ""perks"", you can find what each perk's amount is worth in return to you. Even by donating a dollar, you will be able to share these adventures with me virtually through my blogs and photos. You can also expect an email from me, personally thanking you for your assistance. The more you can donate, the more I can give back. If you donate more than once to each cause, and the total of your donations adds up to a certain perk amount, you will receive that perk's decription. :)</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I wish to be a vessel for all of you that care, to be the messenger, to be the puppet that can speak to an audience, while all of you can only sit back and watch due to your careers and priorities. Let me be your catalyst. Give me your words, thought, opinions...Consider me your voice.</p>
<p>Each and every project I've ever been a part of has given me more faith in the human race, as with each venture, I've seen positive change and progress towards awareness, reaching out to people who may not have known about the issues surrounding the Tar Sands and other climate-change related issues, as well as political decision-making that has monumentally altered original plans that would've had a negative effect on the climate change crisis.</p>
<p>Involving children in these protests, rallies, sit-ins, and healing walks has proven to give them the confidence that even their tiny voices can be heard and make a difference! During a 40 mile bike trek from Central Vermont to the capital city of Montpelier, I witnessed some twenty kids changing their thought processes in front of me, as they beat the odds and biked almost all of those 40 miles. They asked questions, gained interest in things that they were ignorant to beforehand, and began showing an awareness of the world around them in ways I'd never seen before. These changes happened within ONE movement. Imagine what three or more a year could do to our younger generations, and how many people they have the ability to share and capture the attention of!</p>

3rd Annual Tar Sands Healing Walk
Here is another link about the Tar Sands Healing walk that has newly been established:
http://www.healingwalk.org/
 
$1.00 is all I ask.I'd like ... LOVE...to be a part of this. Would you be willing to sponsor me? If you are unable to, is there anyone you know who has a small business/local company that wants to be advertised as being a part of positive CHANGE that would be willing to sponsor me? I can get it covered on film with images & videos, blog updates, and with luck and stealth manners, perhaps even broadcasted on the news and radio.Below is a list of any expenditures involved. Perhaps you know enough people in your network that have a minimal amount to give, the faith that I can make a difference through this movement, and the desire to be involved without having the time. I wish to be a vessel for all of you that care, to be the messenger, to be the puppet that can speak to an audience, while most of you are hindered by your careers and priorities. Let me be your catalyst. Give me your words, thoughts, and opinions...Consider me your voice.One dollar from each of you, could well send me on my way to walking within the realms of the Tar Sands' corruption. This healing walk will enable me to grasp a clearer picture, first hand, of the detrimental effects this pit in Canada has produced. It will guide my energy toward healing the TarSands Pipeline Project. This Tar Sand pit has already damaged many water reservoirs, ruined ecosystems for an indeterminable time, damaged the food chain affecting not only humans but thousands of wild species as well, and is on the way to polluting not just the wildlife in Canada, but much of the soil and water systems in America as well. The repercussions go much farther than that, and I am ready to give resources as well as layman's terms and/or answers to any questions you have regarding this issue.ONE DOLLAR. It is worth nothing to you today. Perhaps an item made in China at the Dollar Store...perhaps a roll of toilet paper...perhaps, if you're lucky, a convenient beverage...But to me...to me it is worth an invaluable amount. Were I to receive this amount from each of you, just imagine the difference I could make for you...I IMPLORE you to imagine! With a life story behind me that shows nothing of ill promise, I survived. I am here for ALL of you. To do do the work of every one of you who is incapable of the time, the money, the passion, the resistance to society which so many of you feel in your heart, but are afraid to act upon. 1 dollar. $1.00 can set you free and make a world of difference.Will you help me to help us all?
 
A little more about me:
My name is Diana April, I'm 33 years old and a single mother of a 12 year old son. Both my son and I have been part of numerous campaigns...including, but not limited to, the iMatter March, Green-Up Day Vermont (multiple times!), 350VT & 350.org movements, as well as Vermont Workers' Rights campaigns.
Beyond the spotlighted events, we live a lifestyle that most would bawk at (feel free to use some of these ideas if you wish!):
~we do our laundry in the tub and hang it to dry in the kitchen, saving gallons of water, and kilowatts of electricity, not to mention money...
~without a lawn to plant a garden, we've collected upcycled containers to plant our own lush garden in on our three-season porch, including using cleaned out containers from food purchases, such as soup and coffee cans, strawberry containers, old wooden crates, and even hummus containers.
~we buy our (as much as we can) non-GMO organic food in bulk, bake our own bread, and store the bulk food in old glass containers - such as pickle and baby food jars.
~almost every peice of furniture in our home has been a used item before we acquired them. Each peice was either gifted to us in exchange for labor, found via thrift stores, or things we've put together ourselves with a little elbow grease and some screws.
~we both ride bicycles in exchange for having a car. This does cause us many challenges regarding visiting relatives and friends, but we decided that renting or borrowing a friend's car and visiting far less often not only saves carbon emissions and money, but also makes the time we do spend with our loved ones that much more incredible.
 
~we no longer purchase plastic products and are slowly seeding them out of our lifestyle (which is no way easy and is taking a LOT of time!), but what we do already have in house, such as plastic baggies, we wash and re-use when we need to -which really isn't that often...
 
~we've switched to cleaning products that are either environmentally friendly (such as Seventh Generation dishwashing liquid) or made from staples in our kitchen - baking soda as toothpaste, although it can be abrasive so we only use it every other day, as a facial and hair cleanser, and vinegar as a hair rinse, household cleaner, and fruit fly attractant.
 
~instead of purchasing many household items, we scour the internet for inspiration on how to create our own, instead of feeding the consumerism. Some examples? -We needed a toilet paper holder, and didn't want to buy a plastic one (which was the most affordable version), so we upcycled a wire clothing hanger into a holder that holds up to three rolls at a time! -We were at odds with how to hold our spice containers without a rack, but found an old CD holder at a thrift shop and refashioned it to hold the bottles of spices. Many more examples, but I won't bore you!
 
~we make all of our gifts. They may not be the flat screen TV my son wanted for Christmas, nor were they brand-name clothes, but in making our gifts, we find the real meaning of gifting, we save the stress of holiday crowds, recycle paper goods, and find that the recipients find them ever more precious than the impersonal gift certificate.
 
~we've even opted for green shipping - we reuse any scrap paper as packing material, pack our mailings in re-used junk mail envelopes and cardboard cereal or tea boxes, and any wrapping is done with paper bags from the supermarket.
 
~some nights, the two of us unplug everything, shut off all the lights, and play board games by candle light (unfortunately, our conversations usually end up involving hunger, though, so we do make some stovetop popcorn for those nights beforehand ;P)
 
~we also have kept to the standard ""CFLs, recycling, keeping the heat lower, unplugging unused electronics, adjusting the temperature in the fridge to use less power, etc etc""

SEED’s mission is to assist business development in a sustainable way through conservation, shared resources and achieving zero waste. The draining of the Ogallala Aquifer, the high soil water evaporation and the deep-water percolation are the main problems that face the agriculture industry in our region.</p>
<p>High Plains Gardens, a nursery in Lubbock County, TX, specializes in xeric and native plants. The greenhouse, located on the 35-year homestead of David and Nancy Hubbard (3211 County Road 5800), uses water from a 185-ft deep well drawing from rock formations in the Ogallala Aquifer. The static water level of the Ogallala in this area has been dropping about 1 ft. per year for the past 30 years. For 2011, it was reported by the High Plains Underground Water District that the average drop in the Ogallala had been 2.9 ft.</p>
<p><br/> During the irrigation season for cotton, the water table drops below the 185 ft. level, leaving this well and the wells of area neighbors, high and dry. In December 2012, watering of winter wheat has also taken place. Drilling a deeper well will allow the individual with the “longest straw” to withdraw water long after the more shallow wells of neighbors have been pulled dry. <br/>The Ogallala Aquifer is being drained at an alarming rate, and as a result, we feel it is imperative to become totally independent of ground water and are working with SEED Parks International toward that end. The solution: collect rain water.</p>
<p><br/>High Plains Gardens is located on a parcel of land northwest of a playa lake basin at an elevation of 3,284 ft. at the highest point and dropping to 3,278 ft. at the lowest point in the southeast corner. During rainfall events, the runoff from approximately 1 section of land (640 acres) flows down the road and ditch, with a large portion spilling across the Hubbard’s property. At times following a heavy rainfall, standing water on the Hubbard property has been at least 2 ft. deep.</p>
<p><br/> The Hubbard property has nine completed buildings, two additional greenhouses under construction and the proposed construction of sheds for housing water storage tanks for a total of 10,766 sq. ft. as a footprint for collecting water. According to the Texas Water Development Board (2006) (TWDB), Lubbock rooftops could yield 16,000 to 20,000 gallons per year from a 2,000 sq. ft. roof. Therefore, the buildings on the Hubbard property could yield about 75,000 to 100,000 gallons of collected rainwater per year.<br/>Help us maintain this long time business with an efficient collection and use of rain water. </p>

Firstly thank you for taking the time to read about our project and hopefully donate to our fight to keep Common Good Land exactly that.... Common (for the use of EVERYONE and beautiful) as well as protecting our High Streets and Town Centre from further out of town developments. We are grateful for your interest and need your help.
The Battle for Bogton Group are mainly residents of Forres, as well as a few good folk who care deeply about our town centres and the protection of Common Good Land. It would be wrong of me to pick out one or two individuals as everyone is playing an important roll in fighting Redco Milne (the wealthy property developer). But you can get to know them better by joining our facebook group.
We now have a dedicated website which you can view here...The Battle for Bogton Official WebsitePlease take a look here to see what a beautiful town Forres is. 
My name is Joni Phippin. I am passionate about protecting independent local business and our town centres, I believe green spaces in towns keep us sane (even if you don't go on them the very sight of it is nurturing) I am not from Forres but I am supporting B.O.B because I believe we have enough dead high streets, enough massive super markets, enough ugly buildings all over the land and can visit them anytime. I don't think we have many unique high streets, enough green spaces, enough money staying local, enough wonderful small towns. Soon you won't be able to visit them anytime as they will be gone. You can't put it back either. No changing your mind 10 yrs down the line.
    Where will our children play ?If we don't support our neighbors when they need us who will support us?We want to claim Bogton Common Land for a day.
We want to claim the Common Good Land for the whole community by staging an event on the land for EVERYONE. We have planned live music, games, crafts, stalls with supporting local groups. 
We want to attract the lovely people of Forres to Bogton Park to see for themselves the scale and impact of the Redco plans
To encourage community. Different groups in Forres meeting and working together
to have FUN.

We want it to be accessible to all - which means free. To do this we need to raise money to pay for the legal stuff. Lots of us are already funding different aspects of the day, but we can't stretch to this last bit.We want to show that protest can be positive, happy and peaceful.

We need £1000 - This will pay for the main stage and toilets. It has to be safe in all weather conditions (this is Scotland) and so we need to hire a professional rig.

Even if we can't reach our £1000 target every penny will go toward the bill... I don't know if you can imagine the difference even just £200 will make. All Accounts will be openly published on pour facegroup page for scrutiny and any surplus will be donated to our Community Council to pay for further legal defence, Freedom of Information requests and title deed searches.

After a number of business experience years in Ghana, we were struck by the environmental conditions that severely affects the nation and most importantly the people of Ghana. After thorough research and studies, we realized the amount of plastic wastes in Ghana will reach a point where it will become a national threat and its devastating contributions towards health crises such as malaria and cholera. We only have one goal and one goal only! Our goal is to minimize the massive plastic wastes in Ghana through an environmental sound way.</p><p>We believe that incentivizing the people of Ghana to pick up plastics in their neighborhoods, schools, communities, churches, businesses etc. will reduce the number of plastic wastes and will produce the guaranteed, expected result. The problem in most communities is that no one is readily motivated to get rid of these plastics, and even if they do such plastics are not processed in the most environmentally sound/efficient manner. Most, if not all, are burned in the open air.</p><p>Simply put: </p><ul>
<li>Your contributions will help motivate more plastic wastes pick up</li>
<li>Our ask amount will ensure more than 200 tons of plastics to be picked from the environment to be processed by our company into reusable energy</li>
</ul><p>With more than 50% of Ghanaians living in the urban settings, you will be touching millions with your contributions. We are confident that with your help, we can begin to change lives and eventually a nation of 25 million as a whole!</p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We need your financial contribution to spark our Plastic Purchasing Program. Anywhere from $10 to $10,000. All monies will be used to pay locals who pick up a required amount of plastic wastes. An equivalent of $50 can purchase about a ton of plastic wastes. Even if we do not meet our entire goal, we will be happy to use the amount to get as much plastic wastes as possible.</p><p>Been to a subsaharan West African country with rich history and culture yet?Contributors will receive unique, local Ghanaian artifacts, trinkets, and textiles up to a free round trip and a fully-guided tour in Ghana (based on the amount given).</p><p>The Impact</p><p>Have you ever experienced flooding after a few inches of rain? Or been to a country where malaria and cholera are among the top categories of mortality rate? Perhaps, in the developed world this may sound quite strange; however, this is the reality in a place like Ghana. We are an organization trying to respond to an evolving problem in one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. In the past, we have helped employ young women and men through our hair salon and construction ventures. This time around, we are not only employing 100s of people but also keeping the environment cleaner, healthier, and minimizing the risk factors for malaria and cholera. You contribution will incredibly impact lives and we are happy you will be part of this groundbreaking effort.</p><p></p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>Our only risk in this project is perhaps not being able to pay entirely for the innumerable plastic wastes in the environment. We have worked really hard to secure high plastic wastes centers in an effort to purchase such plastics once we receive funding.

<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Soon a free-flowing river integral to
the way of life for 14 percent of Peru's population will be dammed.<a href=""#_ftn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></a>
There are more than 8 mega dams planned for the <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Marañón </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">River, which runs
through 10 distinct regions of Peru, including the homes of Andean peasants,
indigenous Amazon peoples, riparian populations and urban communities. At least
100,000 ""ribereños"" (river people) rely on its water and
land resources for food and income. Another 600,000 Peruvians live
nearby. </span><a href=""#_ftn2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">[2]</a></p>
<p>The Chadin II Dam, the most advanced of the dams proposed, would flood 20 towns and
displace close to 1,000 people. These communities grow papayas, bananas,
oranges, lemons, mangoes and coca leaf, which they transport on mules to sell
in bigger towns in the Province of Cajamarca.<a href=""#_ftn3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[3]</span></span></span></a></p>
<p>These dams are
being built in the ""national interest.” Much of the electricity will be used
for mining operations to the southwest, like the Conga mine in the Cajamarca
region. Some of the electricity will be sold to Brazil. <a href=""#_ftn4"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[4]</span></span></span></a></p>
<p>These dams will
no doubt generate income for the Peruvian government. But at what cost?</p>
<p><b>Why Should You Help?</b></p>
<p>Peruvians
living in the high Andes along the river, where Chadin II will be located, have
a good life. They have abundant food, enough money to send their children to
school, and plenty of free time to enjoy the river. Some own property, and if
they’re forced off their lands, they will at least get compensated. But many
don’t own land, and Chadin II will affect these people the most, forcing many
to move into the cities where they will be driven into a life of poverty.</p>
<p>Damming the headwaters of the Andean
Amazon to provide electricity and secure water for large mining companies
is just not worth the cost. For the people, and for the environment as well. The region
is home to over 64 bird species of “conservation importance,” 24 endemic to the region. <a href=""#_ftn5"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[5]</span></span></span></a>
 The free-flowing <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Marañón </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">carries nutrient-rich waters to lowland areas,
providing lush habitats for birds, plants, fish, and water and land species. Gray and pink dolphins, Amazonian manatees, giant river otters, black caimans and giant South American river turtles are all at risk if these dams get built.  Land species at risk include jaguars, capuchin monkeys and spider monkeys.<a href=""http://www.internationalrivers.org/campaigns/mara%C3%B1%C3%B3n-river"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[2]</a> </span></p>
<p><b>So What Am I
Going To Do About It?</b></p>
<p>Well, go rafting of course! The Marañón
canyon is not only one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth. It also happens
to be one of the <span>best locations
in the world for rafting</span><b>. </b>In May, I’m volunteering
with <a href=""http://paddlingwithpurpose.com/the-cause/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paddling with Purpose</a> to take a group of ten young
Peruvians from the dam-affected villages of Tupen Grande, Mendan and Balsas on
a 19-day rafting expedition down the Marañón. </p>
<p>We hope participants in this
expedition will become local ambassadors for the recreational use of the river
and take ""leave no trace"" ideas back to their own communities. For those
interested, we will begin teaching the skills needed to become a river guide.
This informal training is the <b>first step</b> in opening up
pathways and opportunities to professional work if they desire to pursue it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the
main project goals are to:</p>
<p>-  Create
stronger networks between effected communities, the rest of Peru &amp; growing
tourism on this river</p>
<p>- Share an understanding of the larger environmental impacts of these dams</p>
<p>-  Create
pathways for locals to become involved in tourism</p>
<p>This expedition
is part of a larger growing movement to bring awareness and expand the
conversation about the impacts of damming in this area. Our purpose is not to
fight the battle, but to assist however we can. </p>
<p>Paddling with Purpose projects are being completed under the umbrella of <a href=""http://www.conservamospornaturaleza.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Conservamos por Naturaleza</a> (CNX), an initiative of the Peruvian NGO, ""Peruvian Society for Environmental Law,"" that seeks to inspire Peruvians to explore and protect Peru. We also have a partnership with US based non profit <a href=""http://www.sierrarios.org/GuidedTrips/RaftTripInfo_Maranon.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sierra Rios</a>. If you would like to make a tax exempt donation, please enquire how.<br/></p>
<p><b>What We Need
&amp; What It's Used For</b></p>
<p>I am part of a
small team of volunteers donating our time and energy to this expedition. By
eating simple meals, using volunteer guides and gear donated (generously!) from
Sierra Rios, we have greatly reduced the cost of this expedition. <b> </b>However, we
still need your help! <b>Each of us will be paying our own fare to Peru, so every dollar donated on this site goes to the actual funding of the expedition.</b></p>

</div></div>","Soon a free-flowing river integral to
the way of life for 14 percent of Peru's population will be dammed.[1]
There are more than 8 mega dams planned for the Marañón River, which runs
through 10 distinct regions of Peru, including the homes of Andean peasants,
indigenous Amazon peoples, riparian populations and urban communities. At least
100,000 ""ribereños"" (river people) rely on its water and
land resources for food and income. Another 600,000 Peruvians live
nearby. [2]
The Chadin II Dam, the most advanced of the dams proposed, would flood 20 towns and
displace close to 1,000 people. These communities grow papayas, bananas,
oranges, lemons, mangoes and coca leaf, which they transport on mules to sell
in bigger towns in the Province of Cajamarca.[3]
These dams are
being built in the ""national interest.” Much of the electricity will be used
for mining operations to the southwest, like the Conga mine in the Cajamarca
region. Some of the electricity will be sold to Brazil. [4]
These dams will
no doubt generate income for the Peruvian government. But at what cost?
Why Should You Help?
Peruvians
living in the high Andes along the river, where Chadin II will be located, have
a good life. They have abundant food, enough money to send their children to
school, and plenty of free time to enjoy the river. Some own property, and if
they’re forced off their lands, they will at least get compensated. But many
don’t own land, and Chadin II will affect these people the most, forcing many
to move into the cities where they will be driven into a life of poverty.
Damming the headwaters of the Andean
Amazon to provide electricity and secure water for large mining companies
is just not worth the cost. For the people, and for the environment as well. The region
is home to over 64 bird species of “conservation importance,” 24 endemic to the region. [5]
 The free-flowing Marañón carries nutrient-rich waters to lowland areas,
providing lush habitats for birds, plants, fish, and water and land species. Gray and pink dolphins, Amazonian manatees, giant river otters, black caimans and giant South American river turtles are all at risk if these dams get built.  Land species at risk include jaguars, capuchin monkeys and spider monkeys.[2] 
So What Am I
Going To Do About It?
Well, go rafting of course! The Marañón
canyon is not only one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth. It also happens
to be one of the best locations
in the world for rafting. In May, I’m volunteering
with Paddling with Purpose to take a group of ten young
Peruvians from the dam-affected villages of Tupen Grande, Mendan and Balsas on
a 19-day rafting expedition down the Marañón. 
We hope participants in this
expedition will become local ambassadors for the recreational use of the river
and take ""leave no trace"" ideas back to their own communities. For those
interested, we will begin teaching the skills needed to become a river guide.
This informal training is the first step in opening up
pathways and opportunities to professional work if they desire to pursue it.
Ultimately, the
main project goals are to:
-  Create
stronger networks between effected communities, the rest of Peru & growing
tourism on this river
- Share an understanding of the larger environmental impacts of these dams
-  Create
pathways for locals to become involved in tourism
This expedition
is part of a larger growing movement to bring awareness and expand the
conversation about the impacts of damming in this area. Our purpose is not to
fight the battle, but to assist however we can. 
Paddling with Purpose projects are being completed under the umbrella of Conservamos por Naturaleza (CNX), an initiative of the Peruvian NGO, ""Peruvian Society for Environmental Law,"" that seeks to inspire Peruvians to explore and protect Peru. We also have a partnership with US based non profit Sierra Rios. If you would like to make a tax exempt donation, please enquire how.
What We Need
& What It's Used For
I am part of a
small team of volunteers donating our time and energy to this expedition. By
eating simple meals, using volunteer guides and gear donated (generously!) from
Sierra Rios, we have greatly reduced the cost of this expedition.  However, we
still need your help! Each of us will be paying our own fare to Peru, so every dollar donated on this site goes to the actual funding of the expedition.




Cost Breakdown:






Equipment Hire


$4,000




Transport


$3,000




Food


$2,000




My personal
goal is to raise $3,000. If any of us falls short of our fundraising goals, we
will have to cut our expedition down to 12 days or invite a smaller group of
participants. 
Other Ways You

<h3><span><b>What is the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail? (CDT)</b></span></h3>
<p>The dream of a 3,100 mile-long trail spanning the backbone of America from Mexico to Canada was realized when Congress designated the CDT in 1978.  Once complete, the CDT will connect countless communities along its spine across Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico traversing three national parks, one national monument, 25 national forests, and 5 BLM areas. Considered one of the greatest long-distance trails in the world, along with the <a href=""http://www.appalachiantrail.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Appalachian</a> (A.T.) and <a href=""http://www.pcta.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pacific Crest</a> (PCT) Trails, they make up ""<a href=""http://www.aldhawest.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Triple Crown</a>"" of National Scenic Trails. </p>

<h3>Urgency to Support the CDT</h3>
<p>Unlike the PCT and the A.T., the CDT is incomplete, despite being created 36 years ago.  The CDT is falling through the cracks, and is facing great difficulties in maintaining what so many have worked so hard to build and is threatened by ever shrinking federal budgets and resources.  Because the Trail is unfinished, it is vulnerable to interests incompatible with the vision of the Trail as a remote back-country primitive experience.  That's why we need to act now to get this segment of the Trail completed and protect this amazing landscape for everyone.  This section is one of the last two remaining road walks and unprotected areas along the CDT in Colorado. The US Forest Service and our partners are ready to move forward on the construction of this segment of the CDT as it has been on hold already for over 7 years. And, without your support, this project will be on hold for at least another two years. </p>
<div>
<h3><strong>CDT Gap Map</strong></h3>
<p>Take a look at this map and all of the areas where the CDT remains unprotected and vulnerable and see where the Cochetopa Hills Gap area is located. Nearly 25% of the Trail still needs us to finish the job and we can't let this nationally significant experience falter under our watch.</p>

<h1></h1>
<h2><b>What is the Opportunity?</b></h2>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><p></p>
<p>The Trail belongs to the American Public and the CDTC has the responsibility to manage the Trail and its resources in a sacred trust so that it continues to nurture others the way it has nurtured us.  The US Forest Service 2009 CDT Comprehensive Plan states ""the nature and purposes of the CDT are to provide for high-quality scenic, primitive hiking and horseback riding opportunities and to conserve natural, historic, and cultural resources along the CDT corridor.""  When complete, this 32 mile trail section (which co-aligns with the <a href=""http://www.coloradotrail.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Colorado Trail</a>) will be a highly desirable, primitive back-country hiking and horseback riding experience. </p>
<p>The Cochetopa Hills connect the Saguache and San Juan Mountain Ranges and is home to lynx, bear, elk, and the occasional moose. Because of its gentle grades and lower elevation,the Cochetopa Hills should be a respite for CDT/CT Travelers between the high mountains of Central Colorado and the Weminuche and South San Juan mountain ranges. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Instead, the CDT/CT in the area follows various roads and trails. The ""trail"" varies from narrow motorized trail routes  to full-size
vehicle roads.  Many segments are located well below the physical continental
divide, and have little or no resemblance to a true “Continental Divide
National Scenic Trail.”  </p>

<p>Once complete, the project will:  </p>

This campaign will help us raise $20,000 to help build 32 new non-motorized miles of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDT) in the Cochetopa Hills in Southern Colorado.  This project will engage youth from the Southwest Conservation Corps, Tony Boone Trails (a local trail Contractor), and volunteers from partner organizations and the Continental Divide Trail Coalition (CDTC).   The $20,000 will help us secure the funds to obtain the entire project cost ($200,000) and help us build it in just 2 years! But we need your help! The CDT is currently 75 % complete and this project will help us move 32 miles closer to 100%!
 

What is the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail? (CDT)
The dream of a 3,100 mile-long trail spanning the backbone of America from Mexico to Canada was realized when Congress designated the CDT in 1978.  Once complete, the CDT will connect countless communities along its spine across Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico traversing three national parks, one national monument, 25 national forests, and 5 BLM areas. Considered one of the greatest long-distance trails in the world, along with the Appalachian (A.T.) and Pacific Crest (PCT) Trails, they make up ""Triple Crown"" of National Scenic Trails. 


(Learn more about the CDT in this video)
Urgency to Support the CDT
Unlike the PCT and the A.T., the CDT is incomplete, despite being created 36 years ago.  The CDT is falling through the cracks, and is facing great difficulties in maintaining what so many have worked so hard to build and is threatened by ever shrinking federal budgets and resources.  Because the Trail is unfinished, it is vulnerable to interests incompatible with the vision of the Trail as a remote back-country primitive experience.  That's why we need to act now to get this segment of the Trail completed and protect this amazing landscape for everyone.  This section is one of the last two remaining road walks and unprotected areas along the CDT in Colorado. The US Forest Service and our partners are ready to move forward on the construction of this segment of the CDT as it has been on hold already for over 7 years. And, without your support, this project will be on hold for at least another two years. 

CDT Gap Map
Take a look at this map and all of the areas where the CDT remains unprotected and vulnerable and see where the Cochetopa Hills Gap area is located. Nearly 25% of the Trail still needs us to finish the job and we can't let this nationally significant experience falter under our watch.






What is the Opportunity?

The Trail belongs to the American Public and the CDTC has the responsibility to manage the Trail and its resources in a sacred trust so that it continues to nurture others the way it has nurtured us.  The US Forest Service 2009 CDT Comprehensive Plan states ""the nature and purposes of the CDT are to provide for high-quality scenic, primitive hiking and horseback riding opportunities and to conserve natural, historic, and cultural resources along the CDT corridor.""  When complete, this 32 mile trail section (which co-aligns with the Colorado Trail) will be a highly desirable, primitive back-country hiking and horseback riding experience. 
The Cochetopa Hills connect the Saguache and San Juan Mountain Ranges and is home to lynx, bear, elk, and the occasional moose. Because of its gentle grades and lower elevation,the Cochetopa Hills should be a respite for CDT/CT Travelers between the high mountains of Central Colorado and the Weminuche and South San Juan mountain ranges. 


Instead, the CDT/CT in the area follows various roads and trails. The ""trail"" varies from narrow motorized trail routes  to full-size
vehicle roads.  Many segments are located well below the physical continental
divide, and have little or no resemblance to a true “Continental Divide
National Scenic Trail.”  

Once complete, the project will:  


create a destination that will
provide more experiences for hikers and horseback riders to access to the CDT/CT;

create locations
for overnight use;  

provide an
economic draw for the surrounding communities;  
provide facilities that will increase public
information;
and create more opportunities for a families to access and connect to the CDT/CT and the Continental
Divide.  



What is the Scope of Work?

This
project will construct 32 miles of new non-motorized CDT/CT from Lujan Pass to the La Garita Mountains, in the Cochetopa Hills of Colorado.  This section is being designed for hiking and horseback riding.  The final NEPA decision regarding the project is expected over the winter and at that time, how additional uses will be addressed or which uses will be allowed on the segment, will be determined.  It is expected that the public process will be complete by June 2015, and construction can begin as soon as that process is completed.   The project timeline below is estimated and will ultimately be determined by the issuance of a final decision.  These funds are project specific and will be available as soon as work is able to start and allows the project partners to begin work in this field season versus waiting an additional field season to begin work.  Work will
entail:




In early-late July 2015, Southwest Conservation Corps  (SCC) will clear the 32 mile long Corridor.  

In late July 2015, Tony Boone Trails, a Salida, CO based trail construction
contractor, will “rough” in the Trail with Baby Flo', his trail machine.  

In September 2015 the first of 12 crews will begin to ""finish"" the 32 mile long Trail.  This component will continue through the Summer of 2016.


The Volunteer  work will be accomplished through
partnership with: Colorado Trail Foundation (CTF), Volunteers for Outdoor Colorado (VOC), Colorado Mountain Club (CMC),  Back Country Horsemen- Colorado Chapter (BCHA-CO), and other local trail groups.  CDTC will also partner with CMC to provide a
Youth Stewardship crew to serve as technical advisors during corridor clearing and volunteer partner
efforts. 

Project Map:





How will the Funding Be Used?




The overall project cost totals $200,000.  This includes $170,000 to pay for the Contractor, $10,000 to cover volunteer meal costs, and $20,000 to cover the CMC stewardship crew.  We have requested $180,000 of those funds through multiple funding sources. All of the funders require  10% of the project costs ($20,000) in Cash to leverage the funds we've requested.   These are project specific funds and will only be used to fund project specific work. In addition to these funds, our partners have committed these ""in kind"" matching funds:



The USFS has allocated $75,000 to the Rio Grande NF for the SCC crew work, covering the costs of port-o-johns for volunteer projects, and field support. 


The Colorado Mountain Club has committed a match of $19,500 for the Stewardship crew. 

Tony Boone Trails is donating $50,000 in kind staff time and labor in costs to the project.

Outcomes:
With all combined funds (partners and CDTC), we will have leveraged $365,000 into the following outcomes:

We will build 32 miles of new non-motorized CDT;
We will install 3 new Trailheads;
We will employ local businesses from Salida and Saguache, Colorado; 
We will train and engage local youth in the stewardship of the CDT;
We will support over 300 volunteers from the CTF, VOC, BCHA and the CDTC to work over 470 volunteer days resulting in 3,760 volunteer hours worth $84,788 in volunteer labor;
We will build a strong and diverse CDT Community committed to its stewardship in perpetuity;
And, we will move the CDT off of roads and away from motorized use and enjoy a Trail Experience consistent with National Scenic Trail designation and for which the CDT was created.


Who is the Continental Divide Trail Coalition (CDTC):

On May 21, 2013, the CDTC launched an Indiegogo Campaign entitled ""Finding Our Way on the Continental Divide"" and invited you to help us build a grassroots community to protect, preserve, and promote the CDT. You answered our call and helped us reach and exceed our goal. CDTC formed to establish strong community based relationships through activities that support the construction, maintenance and preservation of the CDT, and because of your support, in just 1.5 years, we have achieved the following:


On May 21, 2014, CDTC  became the lead National Partner working with the US Forest Service, National Park Service, and Bureau of Land Management through our official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Federal agencies;
Since June 2013, our volunteers have contributed over 22,000 volunteer hours at value of $496,100 to support the stewardship of the CDT;

We launched our Gateway Community Program and have 3 Designated Communities: Silver City, NM; Cuba,NM; and Chama, NM, and 3 more ready to go!

We launched our Adopt-A-Trail Program to engage our local communities in the stewardship of the CDT and support its users and have over 350 miles of CDT under Adopter Agreements in 6 areas along the Trail;

Our volunteers and partners have built over 10 miles of the CDT, maintained and signed over 350 miles of the CDT, and are ready for much much more!

<p>I have built a redesign of Nikola Tesla`s steam turbine (see
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2ZVi2_cX2s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">youtube video</a>).</p>
<p>The best features about this turbine are the simplicity of it`s
design. My goal would be to power this turbine with a wood burner
(Carbon neutral fuel) and provide a minimum of  1200 watts of
electricity. The steam could then be condensed and utilized as
drinking water.</p>
<h3 class=""western"">The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of such a device could be of global scale (as Tesla would word this).  A large
portion of the global population has to live without electricity and
without safe drinking water. This automatically means that large
portions of the global population are unable to join a global economy
or rely on the use of gasoline and other traditional expensive fuels.
They also rely on open flame wood fires within their homes for
heating or cooking, resulting in major health consequences.</p>
<p>My goal is to develop a prototype, a working model of a downdraft
wood burner made of steel  so I can test the size of the burner. The
burner will have provisions for a stainless steel boiler to be
inserted into the center of the burner to provide as much steam as
required to power the turbine (electrical power).</p>
<p>The burner could be fed by a large variety of fuels such as
pelleted grass clippings, leaves, twigs or shredded wood, all these
fuels are readily available almost all over the globe.   
</p>
<p>This is a project 6 years in the making. The development and
construction of the my turbine have eaten large portion of my savings
and hopefully I can accelerate the development of this burner by
reaching out to others. The shortest way to describe this project is
a mix out of a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCgx5ztjs48&amp;feature=related"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Downdraft
Wood Gasifier</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCu1AFWfkhU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tesla
turbine</a>. The reason I don’t just go and buy a steam boiler is
there are significant advantages to using a downdraft burner design
when interested in exhaust emission and temperature and the char
effect of the fuel to be consumed. 
</p>
<p>This raises the burn temperature and allows to run a internal
combustion engine on the same burner. This would multiply the
electrical output when needed during peak times. These advantages
will result in a better efficiency of the unit as a hole and raise
the electrical capacity.</p>
<p>Anybody interested in joining my campaign feel free to contact me
anytime.</p>
<p>The project is located in Oklahoma.

</div></div>","A robot that plants trees...Robots? Trees? That's right, the TreeRover is a tree planting robot with one goal: to plant trees for you! It is the brainchild of two UVic electrical engineering students, Nick Birch and Tyler Rhodes, who together form Iota Enterprises. Their passion for the environment and sustainable technologies drove them to take four months off school to build a tree planting robot!
The TreeRover

How you can help...We currently have a working prototype, but now need your help to continue. The TreeRover needs technical upgrades to make it a bigger, smarter, stronger tree planting machine!
We require $5000 in order to improve the TreeRover in the following areas:





What you get...In return for your support the TreeRover will plant a tree for you or someone you dedicate it to! Please be sure to select one of the listed perks to ensure your tree gets planted. When your tree has been planted we will send you a video clip showing the TreeRover putting YOUR tree in the ground! You will be able to share this clip with your friends to show off the fact that YOU Added a Tree to the Earth!





For those of you who can contribute more we are offering exclusive TreeRover merchandise, including: 



An engraved pocket knife 
A wood coaster/potholder set
A custom designed t-shirt

Laser engraving by: 


T-shirt, knife and coaster set









Please read the individual perk descriptions for more details and see sample pictures of each item in the Image Gallery.


Lets plant some trees!
So please help us push this project forward and add more trees to our beautiful Earth! The TreeRover can't wait to get out there and start planting for you!




For more information about the project please visit our website at:  www.iotaenterprises.com  or take a look at our Youtube Channel for videos of our progress throughout the summer.

We are always accepting all forms of support (tools, equipment, help, suggestions, etc.). You can contact us through our website, www.iotaenterprises.com.

Support clean energy!

Short SummaryRePower Madison (RPM) is a citizen group that formed in the summer of 2014 to oppose Madison Gas and Electric's (MGE) proposed billing scheme.   MGE's proposal hurts clean energy and energy efficiency by increasing fixed fees for customers before they even flip on a light switch.  Utilities
across the nation are watching the outcome of this regressive billing scheme
and Madison area citizens need to take a stand against these proposals that
reward the rich and penalize low energy users.
RPM opposes MGE’s unfair anti-clean energy policies.
RPM is mobilizing citizens to encourage MGE to pursue clean
energy.
MGE  must see that the
Madison area community will not stand for their regressive, anti-clean energy
policies, and wants an equitable and sustainable future. 

MGE has pledged
to engage its customers to gather feedback before submitting additional billing
proposals.  With your help, we will have the resources to wage a strong
campaign to promote clean energy and fair billing policies by mobilizing the
community and applying public pressure. What We Need & What You Get
RePower Madison has public opinion on our side. The Madison
area is a progressive community, where we can successfully challenge MGE’s
regressive policies, but need financial backing.  Your support will go to:
Get the truth out about MGE and their reliance on costly
coal.
Organize the community to demand better and more fair energy
policies.
Bring in experts to provide information on alternate
directions for MGE.
Hold public forums to educate our community on different
utility models.
Pay for supplies and communications to the public.
Show utilities everywhere that they must listen to their
customers, not shareholders.
The Impact
MGE's billing scheme was approved by the  Public Service Commission of Wisconsin
(PSCW).  Even after public outcry, MGE
refused to drop their proposal, but has promised a community conversation to
guide its future actions:
RPM's initial campaign resulted in a scaled back proposal
and public process by MGE. 
Higher fixed fees and lower energy rates promotes
more energy usage and more pollution, and is unfair to low energy users.  It is a disincentive to saving energy and
harms efficiency and solar by reducing the return on investment. 
Broad public
support for clean energy will encourage 
MGE to invest in wind and solar. 
A strong public outcry will prevent
other utilities from attacking clean energy. 
We must take action now to prevent

Risk & Challenges
RPM faces a well-funded opponent (MGE).  The main regulatory body (PSCW) this last
fall gave utilities what they wanted in 2-1 decisions. The Republicans control

<p>In the Nandamojo river basin, on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica's Guanacaste province, Restoring Our Watershed is working to protect an important ecosystem that has been degraded by decades of misguided land use. A U.S. non-profit, we envision returning the rivers of this valley to year round flow while achieving a sustainable balance between human and natural economies.</p>
<p>Our <strong>Bees for Trees</strong> program was designed in response to historical, economic and ecological challenges the Nandamojo valley faces. Families who participate are given enough capital to begin producing honey from ten hives. In exchange for their new livelihood, they reforest the 10% of their farm which is most important to watershed health, such as a spring or stream buffer zone. They must also agree to stop using herbicides and pesticides.</p>
<p>ROW supplies new beekeepers with a mix of native species trees to complete the reforestation as well as training in natural honey production. When harvest time comes, we pay a fair price for their honey, accepting loan repayment in product. </p>
<p>We sell the honey in the local marketplace for a small profit, which is used to fund further restoration work and provide new loans. So far, we have three families in the program and it is proving to be very successful. A typical household can increase their income by about one third while only investing about 10% of their time.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>During 2013, we have two goals for the program. First, we hope to support two new families with loans to become beekeepers. Also, we need capital for research and development of Top-Bar hive technology.</p>
<p>All of our producers currently use Langstroth design hives, which are used almost exclusively in our area. The top bar design, however, can be more affordable and easier to manage. This campaign will provide for a trial run of the Top-Bar hive design tested in the same area vs. Langstroth hives.</p>
<p>Money raised through this campaign will be used in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>$6,000 will provide capital for two $3,000 loans to two new families. </li>
<li>$1,600 will be used for a comparative trial of Top-Bar vs. Langstroth hive designs.</li>
</ul><h2><strong>Impact</strong></h2>
<p>This project will deliver a triple bottom line return. With these funds, we will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plant <strong>3,000+ native species trees</strong>, representing over seven acres of new forest growth in critical areas. We will include a number of important flowering species in the reforestation mix, supporting native and non-native pollinator populations.</li>

am 29 years old.  If you count all
members of my family Radiata Pine in my forest we will add up to 24307.  Today is a very emotional day for my family. We hear the approaching sound of roaring skidders, harvesters,
de-limbers, process-heads with chainsaws, and other monstrous machines.  For 29 years we survive bitter cold winters,
drought and nibbling possums.  We did
nothing all these years but providing a canopy to shelter and shade a
kaleidoscope of shrubs and beautiful birds singing about the excitement of life
and we help saved the planet by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>We are well aware of the fact that we were planted,
nurtured, pruned, protected against forest fires and saved by humans from the
pineshoot borer, zimmermann beetle and a host of other horrifying insect
pests.  We are ready to sacrifice our
bodies to Homo sapiens.  Hark!  The forest whispers a last request before we
are cut down.  It took us 29 years to
build our bodies our last wish is that no wood will be wasted through imperfect
bucking our stems into logs. As with people no two trees are the same. Every
tree in the forest to be harvest has its own personal signature. Whoever knows
how to read this signature can learn the truth about the tree.</p>
<p>Please spend the 60 seconds required by the
ForestBucker 3D profile optimiser to determine the personal signature of every

Here’s what we have planned:</p><ul>
<li>
<b>COMMUNITY WORKSHOPS:</b> We’ll host workshops with experts to teach residents how to monitor the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of fracking and organize to stop them.</li>
<li>
<b>STUDENT TRAININGS:</b> We’ll convene students across the Northeast and prepare them to launch campaigns against fracking on campus this fall. </li>
<li>
<b>IMPACTFUL RESEARCH:</b> We’ll analyze violations of five gas companies, creating valuable materials for regulatory appeals and legal fights. We will show that rural poverty has increased since shale development has begun. Finally, we will report on the feasibility of a just transition away from fracking toward a green economy in Northeast Pennsylvania.</li>
<li>
<b>CREATIVE ACTIONS:</b> We'll support ongoing fights to stop expansion of natural gas infrastructure, including the Cove Point LNG export terminal.</li>
</ul>By contributing to our campaign, you will help to stop fracking and bring about a more just energy future. From the frontlines of fracking in Pennsylvania to the devastation of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, people are suffering because of continued fossil fuel extraction.

We need Energy Justice Summer.<p></p><p></p><h3>How we'll use the money we raise:</h3><p>To make Energy Justice Summer possible,<b> </b>we need to raise $25,000. This will cover housing, food, transportation, printing costs and other materials, and summer stipends for eight organizing fellows. <b>Our goal from this crowdfunding campaign is to raise $15,000</b>, which will guarantee the house rental, communal food, transportation costs, and $5000 in need-based stipends. If we raise more money than our goal, we will be able to expand our the stipends we offer to fellows and increase our impact this summer.</p><p>Here's specifically how we will use the money we raise from crowdfunding:</p><ul>
<li>
<b>House rental for the summer:</b> $1000/month * 3 months = $3000</li>
<li>
<b>Communal food:</b> $250/person/month * 2.5 months * 8 people = $5000</li>

<b>Transportation costs </b>(for organizing-related driving)<b>:</b> 50 mi/day/car        * 2 cars * 75 days / 15 miles/gallon *$4.00/gallon = $2000</li>
<li>
<b>Need-based stipends </b>for organizing fellows: $5,000</li>
</ul><p><b>TOTAL: $15,000</b></p><p>We are soliciting grants from foundations to cover the remaining for the costs of running Energy Justice Summer. If we don't reach our fundraising goal, we will still run the program but will reduce the number of fellows.

That's about 38 million pounds per day! To say trash is an epic global problem is an understatement, and it's NOT just a coastal issue. The trash is coming from everywhere and every one. In the US alone, 246 million pounds of plastic is consumed on a daily basis. About 24 million pounds of that ends up in the ocean each day! H2O Trash Patrol was founded with the mission to reduce the amount of trash in the waterways and oceans through actively cleaning up waterways and spreading awareness of this overwhelming man-made problem. That's why we're setting out Summer 2014 on a national marine debris awareness campaign called the 50-50-50 State Challenge, where we will be doing 50 waterway cleanups in 50 states in 50 days! And the awareness doesn't stop there! We are also making a documentary of the entire trip to show that there is marine trash in every state and that you don't need to live near the ocean to be affected by it. That way the message can reach tens of thousands more people. And by spreading the awareness, we can make an even bigger impact on reducing the amount of trash that makes it into the oceans each year.</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>The oceans are vitally important to all life on Earth, by providing over 70% of the oxygen we breathe and formulating our atmosphere. We also depend on the ocean for seaweed, fish, sea salt, minerals, and carrageenan (a byproduct of algae to thicken our toothpastes and ice creams), just to name a few. The mission of the 50-50-50 Challenge is to raise the awareness of marine debris, how much trash we make per household, and how making one simple change in our daily lives, we can make a huge impact on reducing the amount of trash that makes it into our waterways and oceans.</p><p>We have had lots of local success with the marine debris removal as well as the educational awareness program in local schools. And we know this Challenge will be a huge success too!</p><p>Our film crew is ready to take on the challenge of documenting all of our travels and developing the documentary DVD. And the H2O Trash Patrol crew is dedicated, gearing up, and really excited for the intense adventure of traveling to all 50 states, conducting 50 waterway cleanups, all in 50 days! We invite everyone to meet up with us on our travels, which will be trackable daily on our Tumblr blog.</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Although this is our first national campaign, currently we have the product support of national companies like Boardworks Surf, GoPro, Body Glove, Nutrex BioAstin, and Quiksilver. And now we are looking for the financial support through campaigns like this Indiegogo campaign, because toilet paper and gas isn't free. :) Seriously though, to make this a success, there are things we really need money for: transportation, gas, food, airfare, hotel, film production costs, and DVD replication. Product sponsors are welcome for those items, for sure! In the meantime, here's the breakdown of the estimated budget:</p><p>$50,000 Recreational Vehicle (sleeps min. 5-6) to drive through the lower 48 States, rental or purchase;</p><p>$20,000 worth of gasoline;</p><p>$10,000 roundtrip airfare and hotels to fly The Challenge crew to Alaska and Hawaii to complete the final two waterway cleanups;</p><p>$ 5,000 food, cleanup gear, and incidentals; and</p><p>$20,000 film production and DVD creation/replication.</p><p>And as a HUGE THANK YOU! We've added some great, fun perks! We have things like the finished DVD with YOUR name in the credits, SUP Lessons and Board Rentals, a One Simple Change reusable bag from Chico Bags filled with all kinds of reusable and eco-friendly goodies to help you reduce your trash output, and one amazing limited edition signed Wyland Lithograph!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Sea Turtle Incubation Greenhouse in Todos Santos is the only one of its kind! It is used to Incubate critically endangered Leatherback nests in Todos Santos Mexico, where cold sand temperatures create very low hatch rates.  Without our project thousands of Leatherback eggs would just rot on the beach here. </p>
<p>Our team is committed to making this project a success, but we lack the funding to do it correctly.  The cost of Gasoline for running patrols alone is $3,000 each season. That is what we are trying to raise here.   </p>
<p>There is also the expense of ATV maintenance, educational supplies, temperature sensors, beach signs, communications, and field tools.  We are depending on donations to make this project a reality. Any amount you can give is extremely appreciated!</p>

<h3>The Impact!</h3>
<p>The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean on our planet.  Without balance in the Pacific, eco-systems suffer and colapse.  Eventually this suffering is passed on to us when we eat seafood, play in the ocean, take our children to the beach, or consume any ocean derived product. </p>
<p>Fishing methods have wiped out 90% of the Pacific Leatherback population.  Without this top predator in the ocean, sea jelly populations explode, killing smaller fish and fish eggs. Remove the Leatherback from the Pacific and fish populations will follow.  the Pacific will become a jellyfish/invertebrate/plastic mush.  What will happen to us? This project actually benefits mankind as balancing the Pacific is essential to our health and survival.</p>
<h3>What else?</h3>
<p>Our education programs empower youth by including them in the development and implementation of programs that protect nesting habitat, maximize hatching, and reduce the amount of plastic and other pollutants that are ending up in the ocean.  The future is in the hands of our children and we are dedicated to empowering them!</p>

The Kentucky Environmental
Foundation (KEF) is a non-profit organization, which for 20 years has promoted positive solutions to the health, safety and environmental problems we all face, by
working for community consensus and direct involvement in government decision
making. 

The Impact
The Kentucky Environmental Foundation is well-known in many communities throughout Kentucky. We are the non-profit organization that in 2002 achieved an unprecedented victory by defeating Army plans to burn the chemical weapons stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Madison County. Instead, a safer, more controlled neutralization facility to destroy the weapons is currently under construction. 
More recently in 2010, KEF was instrumental in defeating plans to build a dirty coal-fired power plant in Clark County KY. With that victory came a unique collaboration between community organizations and KY energy cooperatives, working together to find safe and effective alternatives to burning coal.
Without the ongoing efforts of this small non-profit organization located in Berea KY, the health and safety of Kentucky's environment and our communities would be more greatly compromised.  

What We Need & What You Get

The $3000 KEF will raise through our IndieGoGo Campaign will help us fund the following projects:

new educational materials for Kentucky parents on creating safe and healthy toxic-free homes and communities $800;
research into the health impacts of the continued use of coal-fired power plants in Kentucky in order to produce a health impact statement $1200;
increased advocacy for state and federal policies that encourage energy efficiency & the use of safe, energy sources $500; and
increased community participation in the environmental and economic decisions surrounding the chemical weapons neutralization process at the Blue Grass Army Depot $500.
For your generous donation to this unique and vital organization you will receive the following.
All donors will get a link to KY author Silas House reading his latest short story.
$35 donation -- a stainless steel water bottle.
$50 donation -- a water bottle and your name put into a raffle for a package of autographed books by notable KY authors including Silas House, Nikky Finney, Maurice Manning, C.E. Morgan and Erik Reese.
$100 donation -- a water bottle, a book by internationally renowned KY author Wendell Berry and a music CD by KY cellist Ben Sollee.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p><strong>Who I am</strong></p>
<p>I’m Dr. Jordan Peterson, a professor at the University of Toronto, in Ontario, Canada, a clinical psychologist, and an essayist, panelist and lecturer for TVO. You can find out more about what I do, if you like, at <a href=""http://www.mapsofmeaning.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mapsofmeaning.com</a>. Over the last year, I have had the privilege to work with an international committee that is trying to chart a course to a better future, and we are trying to figure out exactly how to do that.</p>
<p>We believe that we have to start with projects that are clearly possible, do not require too many simultaneous participants, have important short, medium and long-term benefits, and will be supported, from the bottom up, by large numbers of committed citizens. Pushing from the top down does not seem to work particularly well, as the somewhat limited successes of the recent Rio conference and the previous Copenhagen Climate Change conference demonstrate.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are a number of problems, of global significance, that confront us. We have been making decent progress on some of them. A far smaller percentage of people live in absolute poverty now than ten years ago; many more people have access to fresh water. Many tyrants have fallen, and AIDS has been brought under some control. Organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are working hard to eradicate the worst remaining diseases. We don’t really know how to solve some of the remaining problems, but we have pretty good models for others. Ocean management falls into the latter category, and it’s a truly important problem.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p>The oceans are being exhausted at an extraordinary rate. We are rapidly fishing down the ecological chain, from large fish to small, using the most potent modern technology. We have already been reduced to harvesting jellyfish, which have become more numerous as the fish disappear. It is obvious to everyone that this is not smart and cannot continue. Some countries have already done something about it. The best example is Australia, which has already conserved about 20% of its total oceanic territory, and has promised, credibly, to preserve at least 20% more. This is a very difficult task, but the Australians have evidently mastered it. </p>
<p>Canada, which has a very long coastline, like Australia, and which is similar, culturally, to Australia, has also promised to put aside 20% of its oceanic territory. We made this promise, in writing, before an international audience, in 1992, and 2002, and 2003, and 2005, but we still haven’t done anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>Some Background</strong></p>
<p>When the Europeans first arrived in Canada (or anywhere else in the West Hemisphere, for that matter), they encountered a near-miraculous bounty of oceanic and other natural life. We could have that back, if we wanted it – and why not? The oceans recover pretty quickly if you give them a chance. The North Sea fisheries recovered in the early 1940's, for example, because no one was fishing during the war. I have nothing against fisherman: to the contrary, I would love to see them back at work, pulling fish in like mad! But that isn’t going to happen, if we keep doing what we are doing.</p>
<p><strong>The Proposition</strong></p>
<p>It seems clear that the oceanic management problem is important and pressing. It also seems obvious that Canada should keep its promises. Finally, it appears that the Australians have already demonstrated that such promises can be kept (and rather quickly). In consequence, I want to start a PR campaign, to publicize Canada's lack of progress. I also want to invite the Australians to Canada for a conference so that they can tell us what they did, and how we could do it. Then I want to get it done -- with your help.</p>
<p>It has become obvious to everyone that National Parks on land are an excellent idea. What has become self-evident for terrestrial management should be self-evident for aquatic environments. Help me show that many people want this, and I will push as hard as I can to encourage the Canadian government to do the right thing – and quickly (and my friends on the committee I mentioned will help). But we can’t do it without the proper demonstration of public support, national and international (as the Australians recently demonstrated: <a href=""http://bit.ly/OjoEnX"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://bit.ly/OjoEnX</a></p>
<p>If you want to help restore the magnificent, beautiful and bountiful coastal and oceanic environments of North America, help us raise some money, and help us publicize the campaign, in whatever way you see fit. </p>

I’m Dr. Jordan Peterson, a professor at the University of Toronto, in Ontario, Canada, a clinical psychologist, and an essayist, panelist and lecturer for TVO. You can find out more about what I do, if you like, at www.mapsofmeaning.com. Over the last year, I have had the privilege to work with an international committee that is trying to chart a course to a better future, and we are trying to figure out exactly how to do that.
We believe that we have to start with projects that are clearly possible, do not require too many simultaneous participants, have important short, medium and long-term benefits, and will be supported, from the bottom up, by large numbers of committed citizens. Pushing from the top down does not seem to work particularly well, as the somewhat limited successes of the recent Rio conference and the previous Copenhagen Climate Change conference demonstrate.
Obviously, there are a number of problems, of global significance, that confront us. We have been making decent progress on some of them. A far smaller percentage of people live in absolute poverty now than ten years ago; many more people have access to fresh water. Many tyrants have fallen, and AIDS has been brought under some control. Organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are working hard to eradicate the worst remaining diseases. We don’t really know how to solve some of the remaining problems, but we have pretty good models for others. Ocean management falls into the latter category, and it’s a truly important problem.
The Problem
The oceans are being exhausted at an extraordinary rate. We are rapidly fishing down the ecological chain, from large fish to small, using the most potent modern technology. We have already been reduced to harvesting jellyfish, which have become more numerous as the fish disappear. It is obvious to everyone that this is not smart and cannot continue. Some countries have already done something about it. The best example is Australia, which has already conserved about 20% of its total oceanic territory, and has promised, credibly, to preserve at least 20% more. This is a very difficult task, but the Australians have evidently mastered it. 
Canada, which has a very long coastline, like Australia, and which is similar, culturally, to Australia, has also promised to put aside 20% of its oceanic territory. We made this promise, in writing, before an international audience, in 1992, and 2002, and 2003, and 2005, but we still haven’t done anything about it.
Some Background
When the Europeans first arrived in Canada (or anywhere else in the West Hemisphere, for that matter), they encountered a near-miraculous bounty of oceanic and other natural life. We could have that back, if we wanted it – and why not? The oceans recover pretty quickly if you give them a chance. The North Sea fisheries recovered in the early 1940's, for example, because no one was fishing during the war. I have nothing against fisherman: to the contrary, I would love to see them back at work, pulling fish in like mad! But that isn’t going to happen, if we keep doing what we are doing.
The Proposition
It seems clear that the oceanic management problem is important and pressing. It also seems obvious that Canada should keep its promises. Finally, it appears that the Australians have already demonstrated that such promises can be kept (and rather quickly). In consequence, I want to start a PR campaign, to publicize Canada's lack of progress. I also want to invite the Australians to Canada for a conference so that they can tell us what they did, and how we could do it. Then I want to get it done -- with your help.
It has become obvious to everyone that National Parks on land are an excellent idea. What has become self-evident for terrestrial management should be self-evident for aquatic environments. Help me show that many people want this, and I will push as hard as I can to encourage the Canadian government to do the right thing – and quickly (and my friends on the committee I mentioned will help). But we can’t do it without the proper demonstration of public support, national and international (as the Australians recently demonstrated: http://bit.ly/OjoEnX
If you want to help restore the magnificent, beautiful and bountiful coastal and oceanic environments of North America, help us raise some money, and help us publicize the campaign, in whatever way you see fit. 
We would like the world to be a better place, and we are going to start here – if the public demand is there. I have started the campaign with a donation of a thousand dollars, with the support of my wife and my two children. I’m telling you this so you know that I am putting my money where my mouth is.

Nearly everybody may meanwhile know the 5 gigantic gyres of plastic bags, bottles and other items in our oceans. Most of them are made of polyesters. Polyester fibre is also extensively used to produce clothing. But most people are not aware that with each washing cycle hundreds of polyester fibres are entering the wast water. There are no filters to avoid that all these plastic fibres are washed into the oceans where fishes eat them, and so these fibres get into the food chain and are finally eaten by humans.</p><p>The challenge is to replace at least some of these synthetic fibres by natural fibres. One of the most valuable, soft, degradable and amazing fibre is produced by alpacas.</p><p>The textile industry needs tons of such fibres to make industrial production of yarns and fabrics meaningful. Unfortunately, simply not enough alpacas live on earth to produce this quality of fibre in sufficient quantity. One alpaca produces approximately 1.5 kg of this extremely fine fibre per year, and a female gives only birth to one baby alpaca, called cria, per year.</p><p>We, Wendy and Alfons, have a plan to increase the number of required animals substantially in just a few years - we intend to apply ET (Embryo Transfer).</p><p>And that is where we need your help.

The animals live in high altitudes of more than 4,000 meters and have been domesticated already 4,000 - 5,000 years back by the indigenous population. Alpacas are herd animals and are very environmentally friendly. Alpacas are very undemanding: a green pasture in summer or some hay and grain in winter will be sufficient. They don’t destroy the grass by pulling the roots out, but they cut the grass. The soft feet pads don’t destroy the ground like hooves.</p><p>Alpacas have to be shorn once a year before the hot season and each “donates” 6 to 10 pounds of fleece. The best quality comes from the back and the sides. This is called the blanket and counts for three to four pounds.</p><p>The finest alpaca fibres are very valuable. Alpacas producing this extraordinary fibres are called VILYA (Vicuna-Like-Yarn-Alpaca).</p><p>In the 1990s the first alpacas in considerable numbers had been imported to Australia, New Zealand, America and later to Europe as well.</p><p><strong>Alpaca Fibre</strong></p><p>Because of extraordinary properties the wool or fleece has been used to weave or knit clothing for centuries. In Peru in ancient times only royals and clerics were allowed to wear clothing made of the finest fibres. They called it “The Fibre of God”.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529986024/p5loq0shcis2s6cg8btv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Alpaca fibre is known for its softness. The very low diameter, slightly above 20 micron on average, of the fibre and the surface structure are responsible for the softness. It is hypoallergenic, so it is also suitable for people which are allergic to wool. It has excellent thermoregulatory properties due to the unique structure of the fibre. That makes it a perfect insulator. This means that the material is comfortable to wear in winter as well as in heat.</p><p>Alpaca wool is the second finest fibre on the planet, just second to Vicuna. It is finer than cashmere or merino, lighter and warmer than sheep's wool.</p><p>The fibre comes in 22 natural colours from white over various browns to grey and black. It can also be dyed easily and has a natural shine.</p><p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p><p>For very fine and soft yarn and fabrics we need alpaca fibres close to the diameter of vicuna fibre which is 12.5 micron on average. This alpaca wool doesn’t exist in sufficient amount to make industrial manufacturing meaningful. There are just not enough animals that produce the required fibre quality. The natural reproduction of such animals would take too long because of the low birth rate. A female alpaca will give birth to one cria, that’s how the baby-alpaca is called, per year.</p><p>The challenge is to build a herd of alpacas producing extraordinary fine fibres in short time to enable the textile industry to make very fine yarns and clothing.</p><p><strong>Our Solution</strong></p><p>We, Wendy and Alfons, tried to find a solution to narrow the gap between demand and supply and grow a big herd in just a few years. The solution is embryo transfer to improve the quality of our alpaca herd and multiply the birth rate.</p><p>At the age of  14 - 16 months a female alpaca is mature to get mated and become pregnant. Usually the pregnancy lasts for 11.5 months. Alpacas don’t have a hormonal cycle like women, but they have hormonal waves, which enable them to become pregnant again just two weeks after giving birth. </p><p>Applying embryo transfer will improve the fertility rate substantially. Embryo transfer is well known from other species and is proven to work for alpacas as well.</p><p>The procedure is used to get many embryos from one very valuable female within one year. These embryos are transferred into a surrogate mother, while the biological or donor mother is ready to become pregnant again before the baby is even born. Instead of just one cria per year each donor alpaca will have 6 or 8 or even more crias year by year.</p><p>A female alpaca may give birth to six crias in one year by the help of surrogate mothers. If the baby is a female alpaca it will be ready to get pregnant after a little bit more than a year, and applying embryo transfer to this daughter will lead to another six crias again one year later. So if we apply ET to one female in summer 2018 this female will be the mother of six crias a year later. Usually three will be females, By 2019 we will have 4 females, 1 mature and 3 female cries. With the same procedure we will have (1 + 3) = 4 mature and 3 female crias in 2020 and 7 mature females and 12 female crias in 2021. Each of these female alpaca babies can be mated one year later, and another year later it will become the biological mother of 3 females. Year by year our number will increase exponentially.</p><p><strong>Details of our ET program</strong></p><p>Although, theoretically, ET is possible every 2 to 3 weeks, we plan to apply the procedure once a month not to demand too much of the donor animal. We will apply ET between May and September, expecting to collect at least one embryo per procedure. Our expectation is a success rate of 50% which will give us one live cria per two embryo transfers.</p><p>The procedures will be performed by an experienced veterinarian.</p><p><strong>How we use your donations</strong></p><p>We already purchased six extremely good animals, three females, and three males.</p><p>To start the project we are aiming for the following funding:</p><p>Budget (in US$)</p><p>1.

<p>As an award winning photographer and cameraman I have dived and worked in amazing places like South Africa, Egypt and South East Asia. One of the biggest concerns which is painfully evident in all these locations is the impact the travel, sporting and dive industry has on the fragile marine ecosystems they utilize to sustain and grow their businesses. </p>
<p>The influx of tourists to previously pristine and untouched locations is greatly affected by a modern age where travel has become increasingly more affordable and accessible even to remote parts of the world. Most recreational sport divers pride themselves on being responsible ambassadors of the underwater world, but sadly damage is still being inflicted on fragile reefs and marine life throughout the worlds oceans in places where standards go unchecked and the sheer volume of people visiting a specific location inadvertently leaves a trail of devastation.<br/><br/></p>

<p>                  <i>Plastic litters the shores of the legendary 'Blue Hole' in Dahab, Egypt</i></p>
<br/>Looking at the picture as a whole, it is also important to understand how dive tourism can have a seemingly less direct impact, yet even more damaging than that which is inflicted by recreational water users. A location which in years past was nothing more than a secluded village, island, or at times so remote that no human had any reason to be there, when dive tourism puts a location like this 'on the map' it leads to further developments. This usually takes the form of restaurants, hotels, supermarkets and a whole host of other facilities which provide services to cater for visiting divers and tourists. This increase in human activity is inadvertently fueled by easier routes and means to access these places for tourists (flights, ferries, buses etc) as well as by locals flocking to a new tourist 'hot spot' in order to find work or establish businesses to gain from this new opportunity. Although this has great benefits for the country and its economy, the direct result in most of these locations (especially in underdeveloped countries) is a massive spike in the waste being produced and in most cases this ends up as pollution in the oceans they are surrounded by.<p></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With this project I aim to create a visual report of how this increase in tourist traffic to popular dive locations has affected the marine ecosystem by comparing some of the most visited recreational dive sites in the world (ex: Red Sea - Egypt, Thailand and Philippines) to much more remote and less frequented locations like those around the pristine Solomon Islands. Using both film and photographic images I intend to create a high impact, yet very simple side by side comparison for people to understand how irreversible the impact tourism has on our ever diminishing reefs and marine life.

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>The cost of travel to planned locations is extremely high, especially more remote areas like the Solomon Islands. Planned locations are Thailand, South Africa, Philippines, Egypt (Sinai and Marsa Alam area), Bahamas and Solomon Islands. Flight tickets and luggage cost for camera equipment alone for the intend route is in excess of 8200 USD. In addition to this the insurance, accommodation, gear rental, dive operator expenses etc has been estimated to be around 8000 USD. For the use of this project one additional DSLR camera body will be purchased (2800 USD) along with some peripherals like additional storage media drives/cards, camera flight case etc. The cost of the whole project in terms of expenses was calculated to be an estimated 21 500 USD. The balance of 10000 USD was added to cover costs for editing, commission fees (ex: Paypal, Indiegogo) and to cover any unforeseen expenses.<br/><br/></p>

What We Need & What You Get
The cost of travel to planned locations is extremely high, especially more remote areas like the Solomon Islands. Planned locations are Thailand, South Africa, Philippines, Egypt (Sinai and Marsa Alam area), Bahamas and Solomon Islands. Flight tickets and luggage cost for camera equipment alone for the intend route is in excess of 8200 USD. In addition to this the insurance, accommodation, gear rental, dive operator expenses etc has been estimated to be around 8000 USD. For the use of this project one additional DSLR camera body will be purchased (2800 USD) along with some peripherals like additional storage media drives/cards, camera flight case etc. The cost of the whole project in terms of expenses was calculated to be an estimated 21 500 USD. The balance of 10000 USD was added to cover costs for editing, commission fees (ex: Paypal, Indiegogo) and to cover any unforeseen expenses.

The final project is scheduled to be completed by April 2014 but will keep running to address issues where possible.
Perks will include first access to the final project as well as vouchers and products from jdvos.com.
Should the entire goal not be reached, the project will still continue as planned over a longer timeframe and funds will be used to visit those locations which the available funding permits.

<p>We all know that we should recycle.  And we all know that millions of old computers, cell phones, and electronics still wind up in landfills around the word.  What makes this project unique is that – as computer professionals – we’ve identified the reasons, at the individual level, that recycling/reuse of electronics commonly does not happen. This project starts at our community level, but the proof of concept and lessons learned will be translated into information and a web presence that will self-enable people to recycle and reuse as a global practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Plan:  A Local Seed to Grow a Global Vision</strong></p>
<p>One part of the recycling/reuse problem is more simple – that people either don’t know they shouldn’t throw electronics in the trash or don’t know how to have the items properly recycled or reused.  For this part of our program we will provide a physical drop-off site for electronics, a processing lab, and educational materials for the community.</p>
<p>Now, the more complicated reason we’ve found that people don’t recycle or reuse is because of the concern for personal information on computers, laptops, tablets, cell phones, etc.  A simple erase of the device (even if people do know how to perform this action) does not securely remove data – it can be recovered without much effort.  In an age of identity theft and cyber-crime, this is an extremely valid concern.  We also address this in our program plan.  As part of our community service we will provide a high-security erase of all data on recyclable and reusable devices.  This is something existing recycling centers are clearly unable to provide, and a core reason why some people would either not recycle/reuse or – in the worst cases – would more likely throw something in the trash in the hopes it would be buried deep in a landfill vs. the possible data access that could come from taking equipment to a recycling center, etc.</p>
<p>We will securely erase all equipment and then prepare it for reuse or recycling in our eWaste lab.  Reusable equipment will be sent to eco-conscious reuse vendors we have build relationships with, and equipment that cannot be reused will be taken (by us personally) to our city electronics recycling depot.</p>
<p>When we address both of these individual barriers, in combination, as to why people do not recycle or reuse, we can truly begin to make an impact.</p>
<p>The overarching vision of this program is to begin something at the local community level, expand upon it, and translate it into education and practices that can then be applied at a global level.  One end result will be a a web presence to self-enable people to effectively and securely recycle – with information, tutorials on how to securely remove data, access to free security erase software, lookups for recycle and reuse services, and other environmental tips and best practices.</p>
<p>We ask for your support in starting a local community seed that can begin to change behaviors and grow into a global practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Goal</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to initially raise $15,000.  The funding will provide for the following: Creation of a drop-off area for the public that will also have take-away and/or screen display information available on electronics recycling/reuse etc. and a number to call us for questions.  The materials, hotline, and advertizing for people to find the drop-off will also come from the funding.  A small tech lab will be created to perform the secure data erases for devices (hardware and software are part of this cost).  A very used, inexpensive, and humble pickup truck will be purchased to transport equipment to the appropriate reuse/recycle depots we have partnered with.  The rest of the funding goes to the global side – for organizing the information we’ve learned on best practices, creation of a web site to translate this information into actionable steps and self-enable people to effectively and security recycle – with information, tutorials on how to securely remove data, prepare devices for reuse or recycling, access to free open-source security-erase software, lookups for recycle and reuse services and centers, and other environmental tips and best practices.</p>

<p>When I first came to Tabasco, Mexico in August 2014 to do research on the socio-economic impact of small scale fish farming in rural communities, everyone wanted to talk to me about the 'pez diablo' or 'devil fish'. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495921631/jiuoj6zgsrsbwlnihebm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>""It's ruined my livelihood, there's no longer any other fish,"" they would say.  Not having a clue as to what they were talking about, I began asking around at the university where I worked, seeing what could be done with this 'devil fish'.  I soon realized that it's a common aquarium fish!  </p>
<p>The 'devil fish', also known as the suckermouth or armored catfish in English, had first been found in Mexico about 15 years ago. Many estimates calculate that 70%-80% of the wild capture today is comprised of the suckermouth catfish. This has decimated the thousands of Mexican families that depend on fishing as their primary economic activity.  </p>
<p>Owing to its ugly appearance, in conjunction with the lack of information and stigma, people have generally refused to consume it, often believing it to be poisonous. However, the suckermouth is completely edible and is commonly consumed in its native Amazon region of Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador.  </p>
<p>To demystify this invader I began giving informal community presentations to share the information I had learned at the university.  After witnessing the success of these workshops I asked myself, ""Well heck, what if we just change the name and start selling the fillet?""</p>

<p>We soon started working with local fishermen to process and fillet the fish and began marketing the fish as ""Acarí"".  Our friend Lupita Vidal began selling pez diablo burgers in her restaurant La Cevichería.  Today, through our relentless marketing we've managed to sell hundreds of pounds of armored catfish fillet across the country through our company also named Acarí.  It has become a reliable economic alternative for the group of fishermen we work with in the community of Simón Sarlat, Tabasco. </p>

<p>Now we'd like your help to expand and elevate our game.  Demand for our products has risen sharply this summer and we need to expand production and start working with other fishing communities.  We've gone from hawking a few pounds per week to having to fill orders of 500+ pounds and we need to grow!  We'd also like to equip our processing facility with the equipment necessary to mass produce pez diablo products like fish croquettes with chaya and fish jerky. We'll sell these products in Mexico and in the U.S. as a healthy and sustainable alternative to things like fish sticks and beef jerky.  We've already been donating fillets and croquettes to immigrant shelters like La 72 in Mexico and will soon be working with migrant organizations to hire Central American refugees as we expand production throughout Southern Mexico.  We're calling this our quadruple bottom line - not only are we supporting local Mexican fishermen and the environment but also providing invaluable nutrition and employment opportunities to Central American migrants and refugees.  </p>

<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>To build our business we're looking for an investment of $12,500.  Our primary needs to make this happen are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase additional equipment like a dehydrator, additional refrigeration and packaging machines to produce our croquettes and fish jerky</li>
<li>Modify our production facility with things like air conditioning, proper drainage and washing stations to make it FDA compliant</li>
<li>Buy processing equipment to utilize the fish waste material and produce animal feed and/or fertilizer</li>
<li>Meet with distributors in Mexico and the U.S. and send samples </li>
<li>Starting salaries for additional employees</li>
<li>Invest in packaging and marketing materials for the Acarí brand</li>
</ul>
<p>Every contribution no matter the size will help us in our dream of achieving our ""quadruple bottom line"" business.  We want to vastly expand our sales to benefit the thousands of fishermen across the state and provide a steady source of income for their families.  We also dream of sending shipments of Acarí products to migrant shelters around Mexico from Tapachula to Tijuana.  </p>

Now we'd like your help to expand and elevate our game.  Demand for our products has risen sharply this summer and we need to expand production and start working with other fishing communities.  We've gone from hawking a few pounds per week to having to fill orders of 500+ pounds and we need to grow!  We'd also like to equip our processing facility with the equipment necessary to mass produce pez diablo products like fish croquettes with chaya and fish jerky. We'll sell these products in Mexico and in the U.S. as a healthy and sustainable alternative to things like fish sticks and beef jerky.  We've already been donating fillets and croquettes to immigrant shelters like La 72 in Mexico and will soon be working with migrant organizations to hire Central American refugees as we expand production throughout Southern Mexico.  We're calling this our quadruple bottom line - not only are we supporting local Mexican fishermen and the environment but also providing invaluable nutrition and employment opportunities to Central American migrants and refugees.  
So, will you join us in transforming the devil into an angel?


What We Need
To build our business we're looking for an investment of $12,500.  Our primary needs to make this happen are the following:

Purchase additional equipment like a dehydrator, additional refrigeration and packaging machines to produce our croquettes and fish jerky
Modify our production facility with things like air conditioning, proper drainage and washing stations to make it FDA compliant
Buy processing equipment to utilize the fish waste material and produce animal feed and/or fertilizer
Meet with distributors in Mexico and the U.S. and send samples 
Starting salaries for additional employees
Invest in packaging and marketing materials for the Acarí brand

Every contribution no matter the size will help us in our dream of achieving our ""quadruple bottom line"" business.  We want to vastly expand our sales to benefit the thousands of fishermen across the state and provide a steady source of income for their families.  We also dream of sending shipments of Acarí products to migrant shelters around Mexico from Tapachula to Tijuana.  

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate there's still plenty of ways to help! We'd love if you could put us in touch with any seafood distributors, chefs or restaurants that might be interested in purchasing our products.

The booths, displays and art of the festival village at the big lawn at Port Louis, St. George, will be open to the public on Wed. 6th &amp; Thurs 7th April, so many schools are planning field trips to get involved in activities about environmental sustainability. </p>
<p>This educational art piece will be free standing tree sculptures (average 9ft tall) built from the bamboo, exploding from the inside, with plastic waste gathered from beaches, households, roadsides and events - symbolic of the volume and forms of waste we produce daily. </p>
<p><i>Disposable Permanence </i>is being created by Grenadian contemporary artist <a href=""www.malaikabsl.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Malaika Brooks-Smith-Lowe</a> with the help of bamboo craftsman, Terry Moore, and Mechanical Engineer,Earl Roberts. It is the first large scale, interactive art project of its kind to be created in Grenada. It expresses the spirit of the Green Charter of the Pure Grenada Music Festival, which recognizes that sustainable resolutions to environmental issues can be produced through culture. Your contribution will allow us to place the importance of our environment at the heart of one of Grenada's largest events of the year. </p>

<li>Interactive System - Building Materials for benches and additional supplies to allow people control the lighting by peddling.</li>
<li>Transport and installation of the trees at festival site. </li>
<li>Additional funding will allow us to install individual trees at schools across island once the festival is over.</li>
</ul>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We at Music &amp; Beyond, the non-profit organization behind this 1st international festival in Grenada, know that when thousands of people come together to experience a music festival, the amount of trash generated and the overall ‘carbon footprint’ of such an event can be quite massive. We also know that the festival can be an effective platform for important issues like environmental consciousness. So, from the moment that we began conceptualizing this festival we made a commitment to being as 'Green' as possible, for example food vendors must use disposable food service items made from bio-based, renewable materials, from recycled content. No plastic cups, plates, cutlery allowed. Receptacles will be provided to keep trash and recyclables separated, and a ‘take-in take-out’ trash policy will also be encouraged. We are also collecting old sails to make a canopy in the festival village. This art project, <i>Disposable Permanence, </i>is a unique approach to this vision. </p>

</div></div>","Thank you to all that contributed to our powEARTHful 2.0 campaign! We were able to not only raise awareness of BC and Canada's geothermal potential, but were able to raise a portion of the funds that will go towards our most recent report; ""Geothermal Power: The Cost-Effective Alternative to Site C"".

We've decided to continue our fundraising efforts and are offering the perks listed in the campaign. Use the 'Donate' button below to contribute and if you'd like to claim one of the perks, when prompted after you've contributed, enter in the perk you'd like. Please note that to claim a perk you must contribute, at minimum, the value of that perk.








We need you to engage your friends, family and colleagues, and have a conversation regarding Canada’s decision to switch to a truly clean and renewable energy alternative – geothermal energy. If you are looking to learn more about geothermal energy, JOIN US on December 18th for our Geothermal 101 Workshop featuring Craig Dunn from Borealis GeoPower.  CanGEA will also be in Vancouver hosting a Turn Up the Heat Breakfast on January 30, 2015 with Chair, Alison Thompson.

Campaign Update: 
Former Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Brian Peckford, has spoken out in favour of CanGEA’s recent report. He agrees with the recommendation that a moratorium be placed upon the Site C project, while alternatives such as geothermal energy are fully investigated. 

Mr. Peckford is often recognized for his instrumental role in the crafting of Newfoundland and Labrador’s successful energy sector. Amongst other positions, he served as the Minister of Mines and Energy and was also the Premier of the province from 1979 to 1989.
Read the letter here.Looking for a cost-effective, clean and flexible source of energy? It is right under your feet.


“... a failure to pursue research over the last 30 years into B.C.’s geothermal resources has left BC Hydro without information about a resource that BC Hydro thinks may offer up to 700 megawatts of firm, economic power with low environmental costs.”
- Site C Joint Review Panel, 2014

powEARTHful 2.0

BC currently has the opportunity to choose between a conventional, mega-dam project and a truly clean, stable and cost-competitive energy source.
You can help the BC Government make an informed decision so that generations to come are left with a legacy that everyone can be proud of. In the past, the geothermal potential of Canada has largely been ignored. However, as the Site C decision draws closer, Canada has the chance to finally demonstrate the feasibility of geothermal power.

What is geothermal energy?


Geothermal
energy is a green source of reliable electricity and large scale direct
use of (hot water) heat derived from the Earth.  It can help solve some of Canada’s greatest challenges, namely providing energy security, economic growth and reducing our CO2 emissions. Geothermal energy is also the cleanest source of electricity and heat, using less land and producing fewer emissions than any other energy form.
Surmountable
policy barriers in Canada are holding back the development of this renewable
energy source that is already deployed in 73 countries.


Canada is the only country in the Ring of Fire not currently advancing geothermal
Where will the funds go?





We are asking you today to fund ""Geothermal Power: A Cost-Effective Alternative to Site C"". This 10 Point Assessment of the True Value of Geothermal Energy finally sets the record straight, for British Columbia AND the rest of Canada.
While it has recently been demonstrated by CanGEA that BC has enough cost-competitive geothermal energy potential to power the province, those claims are being disputed by BC Hydro and the BC Government in favour of the Site C mega-dam.
powEARTHful 2.0 Campaign proceeds will be directed towards our engineered resource estimate, financial modelling consulting costs, and the follow up required to act upon the report . With the Site C decision expected in December, it is imperative that our assessment is widely distributed, including follow-up briefings, to decision-makers, stakeholders and community-members before then.

<p><span>My name is Jessica Stitt and I am an intern with Cape Fear River Watch (CFRW). Let me tell you a little bit about the organization before I explain our Indiegogo campaign goals.

<br/><p></p>Cape Fear River Watch is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that was founded in 1993 in Wilmington, North Carolina, by a group of people who wanted to share the beauty of the Cape Fear River with the public, and advocate for its conservation and protection. We have several education programs that we share with the public, which are very important to myself as well as CFRW because they reach many different children around the Cape Fear area. It teaches them the importance of conservation of the river and its resources.<br/>

<p>Our goal is to raise $9,600.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This money will go towards three of our Environmental Education programs:</p>
<h4>
<b>1. Raindrop Journey:</b> This program was created to educate 4th grade students about watersheds and how best management practices (BMPs) keep them clean and about  how to clean up pollution. There are three parts to our Raindrop Journey program: pre-field trip classroom activities, field trip to Greenfield Lake, and post-field trip classroom activities. When the students get to the lake, we divide them into three groups. One group goes on a paddleboat ride in Greenfield Lake and records basic water quality observations.The second group is led by a CFRW biologist on a walking Eco-Tour where they learn about the history and ecology of the lake. The third group plays the Raindrop Journey Game, created by CFRW in which, a group of students are given the role of a raindrop, a pollutant, or a best management practice such as a rain garden. ($3,500)</h4>
<p>We need funding for the participating schools’ travel costs to the field trip site at Greenfield Lake. This includes gas and bus drivers. $2,500</p>
<p>Materials, supplies and equipment.  $1000</p>
<p> You would be helping these children with their education and allowing them to get out in the environment and out of the classroom for a day.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  </span></p>

My name is Jessica Stitt and I am an intern with Cape Fear River Watch (CFRW). Let me tell you a little bit about the organization before I explain our Indiegogo campaign goals. The mission of Cape Fear River Watch, “to protect and improve the water quality of the Lower Cape Fear River Basin through education, advocacy, and action.” 


Cape Fear River Watch is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that was founded in 1993 in Wilmington, North Carolina, by a group of people who wanted to share the beauty of the Cape Fear River with the public, and advocate for its conservation and protection. We have several education programs that we share with the public, which are very important to myself as well as CFRW because they reach many different children around the Cape Fear area. It teaches them the importance of conservation of the river and its resources.

Snags (Dead Trees) on the Cape Fear RiverWhat we Need
Our goal is to raise $9,600.
This money will go towards three of our Environmental Education programs:

1. Raindrop Journey: This program was created to educate 4th grade students about watersheds and how best management practices (BMPs) keep them clean and about  how to clean up pollution. There are three parts to our Raindrop Journey program: pre-field trip classroom activities, field trip to Greenfield Lake, and post-field trip classroom activities. When the students get to the lake, we divide them into three groups. One group goes on a paddleboat ride in Greenfield Lake and records basic water quality observations.The second group is led by a CFRW biologist on a walking Eco-Tour where they learn about the history and ecology of the lake. The third group plays the Raindrop Journey Game, created by CFRW in which, a group of students are given the role of a raindrop, a pollutant, or a best management practice such as a rain garden. ($3,500)
We need funding for the participating schools’ travel costs to the field trip site at Greenfield Lake. This includes gas and bus drivers. $2,500
Materials, supplies and equipment.  $1000
 You would be helping these children with their education and allowing them to get out in the environment and out of the classroom for a day.  

Kids Playing the Raindrop Journey Game

2. Summer Camp Programs: Cape Fear River Watch offers high quality environmental education camps for youth ages 9-13 regardless of their family’s income level and we need funds to provide scholarships to lower income children in underserved communities in the Lower Cape fear River Basin. We work to assure environmental justice is a key component in our summer camp program. ($3,850)
For a week of summer camp, each child is $190 for the whole week. Your funding will go towards sending a child whose family didn’t have the means to send their child to summer camp. 
We need scholarship funding for 15 children, which is $2,850
Supplies, Materials and equipment. $1000

Lock and Dam # 1, located in Riegelwood, N.C.
At Lock and Dam #1 in Riegelwood, NC, CFRW recently completed the construction of a rain garden. A rain garden is a planted depression where storm water runoff from impervious areas, like parking lots can be absorbed and cleansed.

 URGENT APPEAL FOR DONATIONS: Yesterday (8 November 2014), while we were on our dolphin survey in Matang, we were hit by a big wave while we stopped for refuelling, which caused our boat to tip over and capsized.

Contents of the film

Climate change is a sad fact. Peak oil is another. Add economic instability to the
picture and we are faced with food
insecurity, probably the single most important threat to our civilization.
Voices of the Transition is a film about how to take on these challenges. Positively. The issue
is not only mere survival, but rather the possibility of thriving and improving
our quality of life!
These “voices of the Transition” tell us of a
future society where our deserts will once again be living soil, where fields
will be introduced into our cities, and where independence from oil will help
us to live a richer, more fulfilling life.

Part I - France is at the forefront of
research in agroforestry: Agronomists and peasants tell us of the return of the
trees into our lifeless monoculture deserts, and about the immense advantages
of a diverse farming system. 
Part II - The English
„Transition Town Initiatives“, founded in 2006, represent a whole new
way of generating new visions of a more liveable future and of acquiring the
collective means to make them become reality at a community level. This
steadily growing movement offers extraordinary possibilities to prepare for
future shocks, without having to wait for directional changes in big politics. 
Part III – In Cuba in the 1990’s an entire
nation suffered from the bitter consequences of an early „Peak Oil“. Thanks to
their inventiveness and political openness to non-capitalist solutions, Cuba
has now become the precursor in agro-ecology and urban agriculture. 

Production 


Voices of the Transition is an entirely self-produced, politically independent, non-commercial
film project. It thus requires a lot of voluntary work. Our aim is to convey
the solutions showcased in the film (ranging from permaculture and agro-ecology
to the Transition Town movement) to a broader public. We hope to show the film
in schools, public institutions and at festivals. Ideally, after recovering the
costs, the film will be available for free web streaming. A DVD in 6 different
languages will be produced (German, English, Spanish, French, Portuguese,
Italian).


Your contribution 
We will use the funds in our honorary project for the postproduction process: color correction, sound mix in professional conditions, subtitling of the film, editing of a DVD, and payment of rights for archive material. The great voice you hear in the trailer belongs to the Brasilian singer ""Renata Rosa"", whom we had to pay for the utilization of the song. 



“glossary of terms”————————
-
Peak Oil is the point in time when the maximum rate of
global petroleum extraction is reached, after which the rate of production
enters permanent decline.
-
Permaculture is an approach to designing human settlements
and agricultural systems that mimic the relationships found in natural
ecosystems.
-
Transition movement – A Transition Initiative is a self-organised,
community-led response to the pressures of climate change, fossil fuel
depletion and, increasingly, economic contraction. Priority lies in first
raising awareness, and then moving on to self-organizing in groups, in order to
actively build up sustainable living and resilience on a local level.
-
Agroforestry – Agroforestry is an integrated approach of
using the interactive benefits from combining trees and shrubs with crops
and/or livestock. It combines agricultural and forestry technologies to design
more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy and sustainable land-use systems.
-
Food Sovereignty – The concept of Food sovereignty claims an international right that would guarantee
countries to put in place best adapted agricultural policies – which would
respond to the needs of their populations without being harmful to populations
of other countries.
-
Community-supported agriculture
– A CSA consists of a community of individuals
who pledge support to a farm operation where the growers and consumers share
the risks and benefits of food production. CSAs usually consist of a system of
weekly delivery or pick-up of vegetables and fruit in a vegetable box scheme,
sometimes including dairy products and meat.

<p><b>A: </b>Yes. The system is grey water compatible.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b>  I have a composter, what is the added benefit of biogas?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Composters are mostly suitable to process lawn cuttings, leaves, grass wood shavings and vegetarian matter. For many reasons, composters are not truly suitable for kitchen leftovers like meat, fish, oil and fats. HomeBiogas is complementary to the composter since it digests the remains that the composter cannot process, and it also provides cooking gas and liquid fertilizer for immediate use.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> What happens to the excess gas I don’t use?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> The built in tank stores 400 liters of gas. Any additional gas generated by the system is automatically released and dissipates into the atmosphere.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Can I store gas for a later use?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Theoretically yes, but we do not provide a solution for accumulating gas for later use.

HomeBiogas is a family-sized affordable biogas system. It converts any organic waste into clean cooking gas and a high quality liquid fertilizer for the garden. Your kitchen leftovers can turn into 3 hours of cooking per day. You’ll be cooking dinner with the gas produced from lunch’s leftovers. Pretty amazing, right?HomeBiogas maintains a closed-loop eco-cycle: organic waste turns into energy and a liquid fertilizer byproduct which enables us to produce more food thus maintaining the critical cycle of life. Know exactly where your energy is coming from and where it’s going.


Many of us have tried to reduce the damage being done to our planet, but without addressing the larger issues, it often feels like a drop in the bucket.
This is a small product with a big impact.
By significantly reducing the damage caused by untreated organic waste, including air pollution, water contamination and the use of fossil fuels for energy, HomeBiogas systems respond to some of our most pressing environmental challenges today.
Our vision is to make our biogas system accessible and affordable for everyone. 
Join us and help pave the way for sustainable waste management. We’re in this for the long run.

Biogas is a renewable fuel that is produced by the decomposition of organic matter in an environment absent of oxygen. Biogas is made up of several gases, primarily methane (CH4 ) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which can be stored and directed for cooking. 







Up to 6 liters a day of any food waste, including meat and dairy


These amounts are the maximum per day, but even one third of the quantity is enough to produce your daily gas consumption. 















On average, 1 Kg / 2.2 pounds of food waste produces about 200 liters or 7 Cubic feet of gas, which generates around one hour of cooking over a high flame. Therefore, at 6 liters / in 1.58 gallons of food scraps, one can generate 1-3 hours of cooking gas each day - the perfect amount for three meals. 








Each year that you use HomeBiogas, you eliminate one ton of organic waste, and reduce harmful emissions equivalent to six tons of carbon dioxide (CO2).  
Using HomeBiogas can offset your car’s carbon emissions!
That means that each year you use HomeBiogas you are reversing the hazardous greenhouse gases that your car emits. 
1 HomeBiogas + 1 car = 0 carbon















The HomeBiogas kit comes all in one box. It's easy to assemble, and you can conveniently do it yourself in your yard in only 2-3 hours.
we do recommend hiring a licensed gas technician to connect the system’s gas pipe to your kitchen stove.






HomeBiogas is perfect for all sized families. It is not meant for industrial use such as hotels or big restaurants.


Eco-villages, community centers, and educational organizations. HomeBiogas is a great environmental educational tool. It's permaculture in action! 

Ideal for farms as well as centers with small-scale animal husbandry, animal breeders, and other animal owners.
HomeBiogas can also be used in an urban environment located on rooftops.






Warm climate: The system works optimally in places with average day/night temperatures above 17 °C (64 F). Under this temperature the system will decrease its productivity. Our system is not suited for cold or freezing temperatures.


 Outdoor availability: You will need to place the system outdoors, so no apartments(sorry about that). HomeBiogas is a revolutionary family sized affordable biogas system.

Your donation provides HomeBiogas systems to schools and education centers among underserved bedouin communities. Your donation to the HomeBiogas-Arava Institute for Environmental Studies (AIES)  partnership provides HomeBiogas systems to Bedouin schools and education centers in the Middle East. Systems we have already installed (see video below) and continue to install in these communities divert animal waste away from valuable water sources; ensure safe and healthy cooking environments; and provide an inspiring communal resource for clean tech innovation for parents and students alike.
These communities currently have no waste management infrastructure, meaning that all animal waste gets either burned or dumped nearby valuable water sources transferring harmful pollutants and toxins for children/community.

The Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, named one of the top 100 environmental research organizations in the world, is dedicated to solving regional and global environmental challenges through international cooperation initiatives, trans-boundary research, and capacity-building projects. Students at the Arava Institute are comprised of Jordanians, Palestinians, Israelis, and others from all over the world.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Schools and sustainability seems like an obvious partnership, but bringing 
the two together is often harder than it needs to be. Many schools are without a green or sustainability team because they simply lack the volunteer power to get it started and keep it going. To bridge this gap, Create Plenty is piloting a four step approach of Education, Collection, Creation and measurable Outcomes (ECCO) to improve academic achievement through environmental action that leads to measurable results. While helping steer schools toward resources to maintain a green team with volunteer support, we will also save schools money, create a way for students who want to become agents of change for their planet, and build leadership skills.</p>
<p>We’re using crowd-funding not only to raise 
money, but to demonstrate widespread popular support for schools going 
green. Contribute to our campaign, and bring attention to the 
fact that every K-12 school in the 21st century needs to help educate its children on how to address the ecological challenges students will face in their lifetimes. Reducing plastic pollution generated in schools will be a first step, and the rest will follow. </p>

Schools and sustainability seems like an obvious partnership, but bringing 
the two together is often harder than it needs to be. Many schools are without a green or sustainability team because they simply lack the volunteer power to get it started and keep it going. To bridge this gap, Create Plenty is piloting a four step approach of Education, Collection, Creation and measurable Outcomes (ECCO) to improve academic achievement through environmental action that leads to measurable results. While helping steer schools toward resources to maintain a green team with volunteer support, we will also save schools money, create a way for students who want to become agents of change for their planet, and build leadership skills.
We’re using crowd-funding not only to raise 
money, but to demonstrate widespread popular support for schools going 
green. Contribute to our campaign, and bring attention to the 
fact that every K-12 school in the 21st century needs to help educate its children on how to address the ecological challenges students will face in their lifetimes. Reducing plastic pollution generated in schools will be a first step, and the rest will follow. 

What We Need & What You Get


We are seeking $2,500 funding for the next stage of our International Plastic Quilt ECCO Project for the development of our program. The Johnson Ohana Foundation will be matching donations received by November 1st, 2013.
This project will produce the academic achievement and plastic pollution reduction data we need to quantify our impact on reducing plastic pollution and increasing student achievement during school.


Perks!:

$25 - upcycled plastic lid garden art on a stick (googly-eyed ladybug or monster)
$100 - all the above plus a reusable bag and homemade cookies
$250 - all the above plus choose from artwork available for sale on our website.







The Impact

The ECCO project will impact in two ways:
·Environmentally, it will show an immediate reduction in the amount of plastic entering the waste stream, and
·Academically, it will support student's problem solving and critical thinking.  Setting goals, organization, collaboration, and measuring results.The current barrier to student's success we face is one that became apparent as a result of our past success - many students who participated in IPQP are motivated to take further steps to reduce their school’s output of plastic waste.  Students need training, mentoring and support materials to develop skills and self-confidence in areas such as critical thinking and problem solving skills, working in teams and community outreach.

<p>Lone Mountain is the first-ever children’s book about the national tragedy of mountaintop removal mining. Set in central Appalachia, Lone Mountain tells the story of a mountain, its people, and what happens when mountain top removal threatens to destroy the balance of nature. Lush with beautiful illustrations of native plants and animals, this book focuses on the unique, renewable resources offered by the Appalachian mountains. And how anyone- big or small- can have an impact when it comes to saving the land they love.<br/></p><p>The campaign to end the ecological crisis that is mountaintop removal has a more than 30-year history, and yet few resources exist for children to learn about this important topic. All of us on the Lone Mountain team feel that it is imperative for our children to learn about the great gifts of Appalachian ecosystems so that they understand the impact of destruction wrought by this mining. You can make this book a reality, and get your own copy in the process!</p><p>Contributions will go directly to getting Lone Mountain printed (the largest cost in our project), paying for shipping (you get a book!), and lastly, paying us for our efforts (we get to eat!)

<div>City Charter High School is a small, diverse public school in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. For the last three years, students of all grade levels and abilities have successfully implemented a school-wide, non-profit recycling business, SEED Students Encouraging Environmentalism Downtown. Through the international organization SAGE, Students for the Advancement of Global Entrepreneurship, our business has grown and inspired myself and dozes of my classmates to take an active role in lessening our school's and city's environmental impact. Some of SEED's accomplishments and outreach efforts over the past three years include...</div>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">In 2012, SEED competed at the National SAGE Competition in San Francisco, California. We presented our then new business and were thrilled to receive second place. In 2013, we again competed nationally in Cincinnati, Ohio. After expanding our business and becoming more involved in the community, we succeeded in winning first place. This year, in 2014, we competed for a third time in our home city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We were again victorious, winning our second back to back national title! </span><br/>
</div>
<div>The next step for our business is to compete at this year's SAGE Global Competition in Moscow, Russia. As the President of the City High branch of SAGE, I have witnessed the profound impact environmentally focused entrepreneurship can have on my city and my classmates and friends. </div>
<div>It's time for City Charter High School to achieve its global potential. </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p>As a non-profit business, we at SEED use our earnings for continuous community outreach efforts, scholarships, and charitable donations. To attend the SAGE Global Competition, we are in need of community support. Our environmental focus allows us to be a part of not only the Pittsburgh community but the global community as well. Here's where you come in. </p>
<p>In an effort to bring our vision of environmental entrepreneurship to the world stage, we are in need of donations. Any financial support you are willing to give will help us to pay for visas and air fare to Moscow and general travel expenses only. We intend to remain a true non-profit organization while still taking advantage of this amazing opportunity to network with students from across the globe. </p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Just as I have witnessed our business impact the lives of my classmates, I know that the opportunity to compete at this year's SAGE Global Competition will impact the lives of our dedicated, hard working team. We have rehearsed our presentation countless hours and invested our time into the improvement of SEED. The opportunity to travel and share our story will provide the kind of leverage necessary to further expand our entrepreneurial efforts. </p>
<p>We are extremely proud of our small school business but understand that this is only the beginning. By competing in Moscow, we will be able to spread our message to other high schools. We hope to inspire other young people to take up action and improve the environment they live in, the environment we all live in. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>It is unrealistic to believe that our entire travel expenses can be payed for through online donations. We are seeking, instead, to use crowd sourcing to cover $5000 worth of travel costs. We also understand that SEED is still only one small business in one small high school. But we are sure that with your help, one day, SEED will no longer be a seed; it will be a forest, and we all know our world could use a few more trees. </p>

World Brand™ was founded in 2018 by Shanna Henry and Petros Pappalas, both Reading, Pennsylvania natives. Bearing witness to the devastation and impact that plastic pollution is wreaking on the planet, we conceived the idea to create a dye-free, biodegradable paper straw that is not only great for the environment, but is a superior upgrade to the current paper straws on the market in terms of both aesthetic and function. Being raised in Reading, PA, we share a sense of pride in the history of our hometown and are inspired and devoted to helping restore Reading's longstanding foundation of manufacturing.  Risks & ChallengesThe vast majority of paper straws on the market today are manufactured in China, which is where we currently source our paper straws.  Bringing manufacturing from Asia to the U.S. to efficiently produce our straws stateside will be a gradual process.  Our commitment to quality, price competitiveness and thriving wages for our employees will be our guiding force as we continue to improve and grow. This crowdfunding campaign is part of The Great Social Enterprise Pitch, a friendly competition facilitated by ASSETS and the Lancaster County Community Foundation. The Pitch consists of social enterprise ideas based in Central Pennsylvania. A Social Enterprise is a market-based, income-generating enterprise that aims to solve a social and/or environmental problem through its business activities. Social enterprises focus on a triple bottom line:  people, planet, and profit. Upon completion of the Crowdfunding phase of the competition, 5 ideas will be chosen to move on to the Live Pitch, during which the contestants will present their ideas to a panel of judges, with winners receiving a package of cash and pro-bono prizes. In 2017, winners received over $50,000 in cash and pro-bono prizes. In addition, all participants have agreed to donate 5% of their total raised funds from their crowdfunding campaign to ASSETS. Please visit www.lancasterpitch.com for more information. To access to the crowdfunding sites of all participating social enterprise ideas, click here: https://www.indiegogo.com/partners/SocialEnterp....",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>Thanks for the visit!</p>
<p>My names Angelica Snowden. I''ve grown up in Canberra, Australia. At the moment, I still live in Canberra, studying for a Bachelor of Science at the Australian National University.</p>
<p>I hope to graduate at the end of 2013. In the meantime, university has presented many academic, social, sporting, even political opportunities. Having access to these oppurtunities has been inspiring and encouraged me pursue volunteering, something I have wanted to do and experience for a while.</p>
<p>Recently, I succesfully applied to work with the International Student Volunteer (ISV) organisation in San Jose, Costa Rica! The program is 5 weeks all up, with 1 week of spanish, cooking and salsa lessons, 2 weeks of volunteer work and 2 weeks of adventure touring. Hopefully, with your help, I will be working with the conservation/wild life projects and experiencing the country's amazing sustainable development program!   </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have set a goal of raising $2, 000 to cover almost half the program price, which is $4, 495 in total.  However, I'm setting my sights high and aiming to raise enough money to match the cost of the program! I'm hoping to achieve this through indiegogo as well as through many different fundraising channels. Will keep you posted on my fund raising venture!</p>
<p>Donating a little will  absolutely take me a really long way! Should you decide to leave a donation, it will go towards my accomodation, meals, necessary gear and general program costs. Ultimately, this fundraising is helping me work with native species and willdlife in San Jose. I'll be set to gain a valuable, life changing experience with the Costa Rican sustainable development program and of course, in many, <strong>many</strong> more ways.  </p>
<p>While every donation recieved will be greatly appreciated, there are some <strong>perks</strong> for high bidders!! I've only set one perk, at a $50 (or greater) donation. Donors of this amount will be awarded with ... ***<em>drum roll please!</em>***</p>
<p>A personal invitation (from me! in person, or via youtube, facebook, twitter, mail, plane writing in the sky.. you name it!) to a one night only event, Ladies &amp; Gentlemen ... A SNOWDEN BASH (Renowned, yet rare these days) To be henceforth titled, 'Angelica's Destination: Costa Rica!' party! </p>
<p>But seriously, I couldn't think of a better way to share my experiences, photos, laughs, war stories, EVERYTHING with you and the rest of my friends &amp; family, then hosting everyone to a party and celebrating together! I'll provide drinks, music, a taste of Central and South America and of course, the company!    </p>
<p>...and yes, while it will be a Latino flavoured party, dress for a jungle themed twist of the tropical Costa Rican kind, amigas!! ;D</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Supporting me, means supporting ISV's initiative in Costa Rica. You will encourage the organisation's long standing effort to develop grass roots and a long term foundation for sustainable projects in wildlife and habitat conservation. If you're interested in finding out more infomation on my project, or the organisation I would encourage you to check out this link!</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.isvolunteers.org/destination/costa-rica"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.isvolunteers.org/destination/costa-rica</a> (there's also lots of infomation if you're interested in volunteering yourself!)</p>
</div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute (I'm a university student, you're preaching to the choir!), but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<p>I would encourage anyone who has access to my fundraiser to help me make some noise about it! Feel free to share on social networking sites, email even word of mouth (prehistoric methods are celebrated &amp; highly respected!! haha)  </p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time and generosity, it is very much appreciated and I look forward to sharing my adventures with you!</strong> What's more, watch this space  for info on a travel blog I'll keep so I can share pics, vids and stories while I'm overseas !! </p></div>","Short Summary

<p>Help us <strong>Expand Mistletoe Ranch.</strong></p>
<p>Dave and Shannon have built an off grid home in the pine and oak forest that is adjacent to the Gila National Forest. The small home, nestled on 11 acres, is a model for low impact and environmentally responsible living. Dave and Shannon live on Mistletoe Ranch with their beloved husky mix mutt rescue dog, Cuba.</p>
<p><strong>Plant Based Business:</strong> We can harvest and sell Mistletoe for the health and wellbeing industry and for ceremonial and religious use. Most of our sales are in winter time. We have an abundance of high grade mistletoe that grows on the oak trees in our forest. Every year more and more grows. We want to purchase the 15 acre parcel next to us to help expand our available harvest and to increase the amount of land under sound environmental stewardship.</p>
<p>If you help us with a contribution, we can ensure that we have the sustainable resources to keep this land safe from development and sprawl. The plant based business that is Mistletoe Ranch can continue for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Help us Buy and Protect 15 More Acres</strong></p>
<p>We need help securing money to purchase the 15 acres of land next to us. We can raise some of the money with Mistletoe sales and savings from our jobs, but are asking you to help us. This is beautiful and sacred New Mexico mixed conifer and oak forest. We are living small on the land with our 900 square foot home, water harvesting system and passive and active solar energy. Totally off grid. We build the house ourselves over a two year period of working weekends and evenings. Shannon and I both have jobs that we attend to help cover the costs of construction and the cost of the original 11 acres we bought five years ago. We are both dreaming of the day when we work full time on the Ranch. We will be faithful and dedicated stewards of this beautiful and gentle land. Come visit and see what makes this land so special.</p>
<p><strong>Your Contribution Will Help Protect This Land</strong></p>
<p>Help us protect this land with a contribution and we will send you a sample of the mistletoe we harvest, package and distribute. Other perks too.</p>
<p><strong>Help Spread The Word</strong></p>
<p>Spread the word about our plans here in New Mexico and if you are not able to contribute at this time, please send us some good thoughts and wishes in our efforts to expand this plant based business.</p>

<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>Every December, the Dordt College community participates in a service project. This year, Dordt’s student-led sustainability committee has teamed up with <a href=""http://yecaction.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Young Evangelicals for Climate Action</a> (YECA) and the <a href=""http://www.creationcare.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Evangelical Environmental Network</a> (EEN) to organize a campus-wide sustainability initiative. We are challenging the Dordt community to reduce the amount of recyclable materials that end up in the trash by at least 50%. Through this project, we hope to educate the campus on how easy recycling can be and to instill an ethic of recycling in our community.</p>
<p>In addition to the recycling push, we are challenging the greater Dordt community to raise $10,000 for <a href=""http://www.onebodyonehope.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">One Body, One Hope</a>, a collaboration between Sioux Center and Liberian communities. These funds will be used to purchase solar panels that will allow the entire One Body, One Hope campus to be run on efficient, dependable solar energy. One campus reducing waste to enable another to do the same.</p>
<p>In order to pull this initiative off, Dordt needs to increase its capacity for recycling, specifically by purchasing attractive, 3-section recycling bins to be placed around campus. Dordt administration has agreed to invest $1,500 into this project granted that the Dordt sustainability committee can match it.</p>
<p>We believe that this project has the potential to create real transformation: transformation on Dordt's campus as students learn the skills to steward God's creation well. Transformation in Liberian communities as they install clean and dependable sources of energy to further fuel their ongoing work. And transformation of God's creation as harmful trash is kept out of landfills and dirty energy is taken offline.</p>
<p>Will you join us on this journey of transformation by giving today?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Numbers</h3>
<ul>
<li>We want to purchase several 3-section recycling bins to be placed throughout Dordt's campus. Each bin costs $900.</li>
<li>All the money that we raise will go straight toward purchasing the bins. Even if we don't raise our entire goal, we will purchase as many bins as we can with the money that's raised.</li>
<li>Additional funds raised will go toward YECA's Climate Leadership Fellows program to help more campuses across the country take similar action on climate change.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>The recycling bins will educate 1,458 U.S. students about the importance of recycling and will empower them to make it a basic part of their Christian life of discipleship.</li>
<li>The recycling bins will reduce the quantity of recyclable material in the garbage at Dordt by 50% in the first year.</li>
<li>The story of the sustainability project will be shared with 18,000 alumni around the world.</li>
<li>The solar panels at the One Body, One Hope, Liberia campus will provide clean, dependable power for 642 children and adults.</li>

<strong>Comenzó con un sueño:</strong> Cultivar nuestros propios alimentos, pero la vida muchas veces tiene otros planes para ti, y nosotros no fuimos la excepción.</h3>
<p>Trabajando como voluntarios y en el campo, nos dimos cuenta que en el mundo estamos tomando más de lo que entregamos y no estamos permitiendo que la naturaleza se regenere. Sequías, inundaciones, erosión, hambruna, deforestación, contaminación y el cambio climático son los resultados de la vida que nos hemos dado durante el último siglo. Y si bien muchos intentan luchar por la naturaleza y las comunidades, no es suficiente.</p>

<p>Estamos ubicados en Río Puelo, en la comuna de Cochamó, X Región de los Lagos, en la hermosa y amenazada Patagonia secreta de Chile.</p>
<p>Este valle, de gran extensión geográfica, ha sido clasificado como una “Zona extrema” debido a su difícil acceso, pobreza, bajo número de habitantes y la falta de servicios públicos tanto de centros médicos como de colegios. En este valle escondido, las familias y comunidades viven y practican métodos tradicionales de agricultura, apicultura, artesanías, ganadería y gastronomía. Sin embargo, el alto impacto de un turismo sin planificación, el impacto del cambio climático y el silencioso avance de las industrias de la energía han traído dificultades y generado una crisis/oportunidad en donde una transición debe llevarse a cabo. Esta situación, determinará el futuro del valle, su naturaleza y gente.</p>

<h3>¿Qué es lo que queremos?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Proteger este valle mediante las siguientes estrategias:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promover un desarrollo agroecológico</li>
<li>Trabajar y compartir con nuestra comunidad</li>
<li>Educar e intercambiar los conocimientos</li>
<li>Empoderar a la comunidad y revivir tradiciones ancestrales</li>

</ul>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para ser la transición y el agente de cambio que queremos ser, debemos construir nuestra piedra fundacional para el cambio: un centro de aprendizaje con la infraestructura suficiente para reunir a la comunidad, estudiantes y organizaciones en un espacio cómodo. Este centro tendrá los siguientes objetivos:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ser un centro para el aprendizaje de Permacultura y el intercambio de conocimientos y disciplinas</li>
<li>Ser un aporte para la comunidad, promoviendo la articulación comunitaria, entrega de capacitaciones, programas de voluntariados e impartición de educación formal e informal.</li>
<li>Ser un espacio para la enseñanza de la permacultura, agroecología, sistemas sustentables y educación ambiental, dentro y fuera de la comunidad.</li>

<p>Con capacidad para alojar a 16 personas, además de una sala de clases para 30 personas, este centro generará su propia energía a través de paneles fotovoltaicos, almacenará su propia agua captando el agua lluvia desde los techos y limpiará sus aguas grises con un sistema de humedal con plantas depuradoras actuando como un biofiltro.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>El edificio completo está pensado en tres etapas de construcción, cada etapa representa 1 año de trabajo y tiempo.</p>
<p><strong>1ra etapa:</strong> Construcción de Eco-escuela</p>
<p><strong>2da etapa:</strong> Cocina, pasillo e invernadero experimental.</p>
<p><strong>3ra etapa:</strong> Módulo de dormitorios.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Todos estos programas se construirán en torno a un patio central el cual funciona como una plaza con un humedal artificial integrado donde se podrán desarrollar actividades de ocio.</p>
<p>Se destaca la capacidad autosuficiente del edificio, utilizando sistemas de recolección de aguas, purificación de las aguas grises y una calefacción solar pasiva gracias a su posición con respecto al sol y la maximización de la luz solar durante el invierno, actuando como una “trampa solar” debido a la disposición de los módulos y su forma de U.</p>

It begins with a dream: To grow our own food,
but life many times has different plans for you, and we are not an exception.As a volunteer and farm workers we realized that we are still taking more than we’re giving and we’re not letting nature to recover. Droughts, floods, erosion, hunger, deforestation, pollution, and climate change are the results of the life we’ve given to ourselves during the last 100 years. And even though some of us try to stand for nature and people, just some are not enough. So what can we do?Raices del Viento Learning Centre: A sustainable center for change.NGO Permaculture Río Puelo is a nonprofit organization and an international permaculture centre that have the vision of being part of a cultural transformation while providing solutions for permanent abundance by training and empowering local and international people to become agents of change in their own communities and countries.Our mission is to work with individuals and communities to teach and learn and expand the knowledge and practice of ecological agriculture, sustainable development, natural building, education, tourism and spirituality all under the ethics of permaculture.It is, indeed, part of our mission to promote the decentralization and the grassroot expansion of permaculture in Chile and the world.    Where are we? We are settled in Rio Puelo, Cochamó district, X Region de los Lagos, on the astonishing and threatened secret side of Patagonia, Chile.This valley of great geographic extension, has been classified as an “extreme zone” due to its difficult access, poverty, it’s low number of inhabitants and the lack of public services like medical centers and high schools.  In this hidden valley, families and communities live and practice their traditional knowledge related to agriculture, beekeeping, art crafts, animal husbandry and gastronomy. However, the impact of development as well as droughts, erosion and the silent approach of hydroelectrics had brought difficulties to the valley and generated a crisis/opportunity situation in which a transition must happen. This situation will determine the future of the valley, it’s nature and people.Towards which way we want to go?  Towards the private and thoughtless or communal and thoughtful development? Towards the destruction and extraction of our natural resources or towards the sustainable development and use of this resources?   What do we want?Protect this valley by:
Promote a sustainable agriculture
To work and share with our community
To educate and share knowledge
Bring back old traditions
Build resilience in our community and world
Find solutions to the local necessities (water shortage, production, yields, etc)
How?So to be the transition and agent of change that we want to be, we must build our bedrock foundation for change. A Learning Centre with the infrastructure to gather our community, students and organizations in a comfortable space. This centre will have the following objectives:
Be a learning centre for permaculture and the exchange of knowledge
Contribute to the community through capacitation, volunteer programs and education
Be a space for the promotion of permaculture, agroecology and sustainable systems inside and outside the community.
Educate about the caring of the environment, sustainable agriculture, health, well being and the good living.
 The Centre  With a capacity to accommodate 15 people and educate a maximum of 30 students, this center will generate its own energy through solar panels, store its own water through rain catchment and clean its gray waters with the use of an artificial wetland. It will produce food with an integrated experimental greenhouse and it will be built using a passive heating system.The whole building has a total of 3 stages of construction, every stage represent a year of work:1st “Learning hall” module2nd Kitchen, Hallway and Greenhouse3rd Dormitory This 3 modules will be built around a central park that function as a plaza with an integrated artificial wetland. This area would serve as a leisure space.The building stands for it’s self-sufficient capacity by using water collection, biofilter, and passive solar heating due to its position towards the sun, the maximization of the winter sun due to the location and angle of the windows and the U shape, acting as a solar trap. About the Natural BuildersWe will bring 5 great exponents and teachers around the Latin American circles of Natural Building. With their help we will impart a course, capacitate and self build our dreamed center.

[Español] 

Comenzó con un sueño: Cultivar nuestros propios alimentos, pero la vida muchas veces tiene otros planes para ti, y nosotros no fuimos la excepción.
Trabajando como voluntarios y en el campo, nos dimos cuenta que en el mundo estamos tomando más de lo que entregamos y no estamos permitiendo que la naturaleza se regenere. Sequías, inundaciones, erosión, hambruna, deforestación, contaminación y el cambio climático son los resultados de la vida que nos hemos dado durante el último siglo. Y si bien muchos intentan luchar por la naturaleza y las comunidades, no es suficiente.
 
¿Qué podemos hacer?
 
Centro de Aprendizaje Raíces del Viento: Un centro sustentable para el cambio.
ONG Permacultura Río Puelo es una organización sin fines de lucro y un centro internacional de Permacultura que tiene como visión ser parte de una transformación cultural, entregando soluciones para una abundancia permanente a través de la enseñanza y el empoderamiento tanto local como universal, generando agentes de cambio en distintas comunidades y países.
Nuestra misión es trabajar con individuos y comunidades, aprender y enseñar, y expandir el conocimiento y práctica de la agricultura ecológica, Bioconstrucción, educación, turismo sustentable y espiritualidad bajo las éticas de la Permacultura.
Es también parte de nuestra misión promover la descentralización y expansión de la Permacultura en Chile y el mundo.
 
¿Dónde estamos?

Estamos ubicados en Río Puelo, en la comuna de Cochamó, X Región de los Lagos, en la hermosa y amenazada Patagonia secreta de Chile.
Este valle, de gran extensión geográfica, ha sido clasificado como una “Zona extrema” debido a su difícil acceso, pobreza, bajo número de habitantes y la falta de servicios públicos tanto de centros médicos como de colegios. En este valle escondido, las familias y comunidades viven y practican métodos tradicionales de agricultura, apicultura, artesanías, ganadería y gastronomía. Sin embargo, el alto impacto de un turismo sin planificación, el impacto del cambio climático y el silencioso avance de las industrias de la energía han traído dificultades y generado una crisis/oportunidad en donde una transición debe llevarse a cabo. Esta situación, determinará el futuro del valle, su naturaleza y gente.

¿Hacia dónde queremos dirigirnos? ¿Hacia el desarrollo privado y desconsiderado o hacia el desarrollo comunal y precavido?, ¿Hacia la destrucción y extracción de los recursos naturales o hacia el desarrollo y uso sustentable de éstos?
 
 

 
¿Qué es lo que queremos?
 
Proteger este valle mediante las siguientes estrategias:

Promover un desarrollo agroecológico
Trabajar y compartir con nuestra comunidad
Educar e intercambiar los conocimientos
Empoderar a la comunidad y revivir tradiciones ancestrales
Construir resiliencia en la comunidad y promoverla en el mundo.
Buscar y entregar soluciones a las necesidades locales: Escasez de agua, capacitaciones, condición de los suelos, altos costos de producción, etc.

¿Cómo?
Para ser la transición y el agente de cambio que queremos ser, debemos construir nuestra piedra fundacional para el cambio: un centro de aprendizaje con la infraestructura suficiente para reunir a la comunidad, estudiantes y organizaciones en un espacio cómodo. Este centro tendrá los siguientes objetivos:

Ser un centro para el aprendizaje de Permacultura y el intercambio de conocimientos y disciplinas
Ser un aporte para la comunidad, promoviendo la articulación comunitaria, entrega de capacitaciones, programas de voluntariados e impartición de educación formal e informal.
Ser un espacio para la enseñanza de la permacultura, agroecología, sistemas sustentables y educación ambiental, dentro y fuera de la comunidad.
Educar sobre el cuidado del medio ambiente, la salud, el bienestar y el buen vivir.


El Centro
 

Con capacidad para alojar a 16 personas, además de una sala de clases para 30 personas, este centro generará su propia energía a través de paneles fotovoltaicos, almacenará su propia agua captando el agua lluvia desde los techos y limpiará sus aguas grises con un sistema de humedal con plantas depuradoras actuando como un biofiltro.

 
El edificio completo está pensado en tres etapas de construcción, cada etapa representa 1 año de trabajo y tiempo.
1ra etapa: Construcción de Eco-escuela
2da etapa: Cocina, pasillo e invernadero experimental.
3ra etapa: Módulo de dormitorios.

 
Todos estos programas se construirán en torno a un patio central el cual funciona como una plaza con un humedal artificial integrado donde se podrán desarrollar actividades de ocio.
Se destaca la capacidad autosuficiente del edificio, utilizando sistemas de recolección de aguas, purificación de las aguas grises y una calefacción solar pasiva gracias a su posición con respecto al sol y la maximización de la luz solar durante el invierno, actuando como una “trampa solar” debido a la disposición de los módulos y su forma de U.

 
Bioconstructores
Traeremos a 5 grandes exponentes de la Bioconstrucción Latinoamericana quienes realizarán un curso, capacitarán y nos ayudarán a construir el deseado centro. Estos 5 constructores son también discípulos del gran Jorge Belanko. Para más información revisa el programa AQUI.
Raúl Macedo, originario de Uruguay, constructor natural, con amplia experiencia en la construcción de viviendas familiares, se dedica al asesoramiento y dirección de obra, fomentando la autoconstrucción y la reutilización de materiales. Ha dado talleres junto a Jorge Belanko y es parte del equipo Terradobe más info: Aquí
Gonzalo Castaño, argentino, ingeniero civil, con experiencia en cálculo de estructura en construcción con tierra. Forma parte del equipo EcoHacer junto a Marco Aresta, actualmente lleva adelante un proyecto de comunidad sostenible en San Marco Sierras, prov de Córdoba, Argentina. Llamado Yacumama. Ha dado talleres junto a Jorge Belanko y es parte del equipo Terradobe más info: EcoHacer
Damián Cárdenas, argentino, constructor natural, ha hecho un amplio recorrido acompañando a Jorge Belanko y Gernot Minke en talleres por Latinoamérica. También forma parte del colectivo Manos en Barro y del equipo Terradobe. Más info Aquí
Máximo Malaurie, argentino, constructor y formador en construcción natural. Ha iniciado su experiencia junto a Jorge Belanko, y actualmente lleva adelante el proyecto Barro Para Todos, que busca acercar la experiencia del barro a diferentes contextos socioculturales. También ha formado un estudio de arquitectura, llamado Xilema, el cual se aboca a realizar proyecto y obra. Forma parte del equipo Terradobe. Más info: Xilema , Barro para Todos
 
¿Cuánto necesitamos y para qué?

Gran parte de la madera será sacada de nuestra tierra y de un aserradero local, el trabajo de obra será realizado por nosotros mismos y la ayuda de nuestros vecinos quienes serán remunerados.
Con lo recaudado, traeremos a grandes exponentes de la Bioconstrucción quienes también darán un curso para quienes optaron por la recompensa correspondiente. Aprovecha esta gran oportunidad para hacerte parte de este proyecto y aprender con maestros de la construcción natural.Los materiales y herramientas como techumbre, paneles solares, ventanas, aislación, etc. serán transportados por camión y tractor hasta el lugar más cercano.

<h3>Pourquoi donner?</h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Des pancartes reniant l’influence des humains dans le rôle des changements climatiques ont fait leur apparition sur l'autoroute 40 dans la région de Montréal. Cette imposture scientifique est une nouvelle attaque envers l’intelligence des Québécois, et envers la culture scientifique que nous bâtissons depuis plusieurs décennies. Elle est d’autant plus vicieuse que ses auteurs, Friends of science, un organisme climatosceptique albertain, prétendent parler au nom de la science et usurpent sa crédibilité pour désinformer la population.</p>

Des pancartes reniant l’influence des humains dans le rôle des changements climatiques ont fait leur apparition sur l'autoroute 40 dans la région de Montréal. Cette imposture scientifique est une nouvelle attaque envers l’intelligence des Québécois, et envers la culture scientifique que nous bâtissons depuis plusieurs décennies. Elle est d’autant plus vicieuse que ses auteurs, Friends of science, un organisme climatosceptique albertain, prétendent parler au nom de la science et usurpent sa crédibilité pour désinformer la population.


Why donate?

Billboards denying the influence of humans on climate change
have begun to appear along Autoroute 40 around Montreal. This scientific
misinformation is yet another attack on Québecers’ intelligence and on the scientific literacy we have been
building for many years. Even more perverse is that Friends of Science – the Alberta-based climate skeptic group
behind the billboards – claims to speak on behalf of science and is using the credibility
of science to mislead the public.

Il faut réagir pour empêcher ces messages dangereux de s'implanter, des
messages qui minent les efforts que nous faisons pour contrer les changements climatiques. Et nous souhaitons affirmer, par tous les moyens possibles, que la désinformation scientifique n'est pas la bienvenue en sol québécois.
Avec votre appui, nous répliquons à cette campagne de désinformation scientifique en installant 3 panneaux sur les autoroutes 40 et 440, dans la région montréalaise. Un partenaire nous offre le graphisme et nous avons obtenu un rabais de près de 70% pour la production de ces panneaux, ciblant chacun entre 50 000 et 80 000 personnes par jour. Une occasion inespérée d'agir!
Cette riposte nous donnera l'occasion d'attirer l'attention du public sur la nécessité de préserver notre culture scientifique et de l'éduquer sur les mythes existants.
Aidez-nous en participant au financement de cette riposte pour rétablir les faits sur les changements climatiques et plus généralement pour garantir le droit à une information scientifique juste et de qualité!
-----

We must take action to prevent such dangerous messages from
taking hold – messages that undermine our efforts to counteract climate change.
We also want to state loudly and clearly, by every means possible, that
scientific disinformation is not welcome in Québec. 
With your support, we can respond to this campaign by installing
three billboards along Autoroutes 40 and 440 in the Montreal region. A partner
is providing the graphic design free of charge, and we are getting a 70%
discount on producing the billboards, each of which will reach 50,000 to 80,000
people per day. It’s
a golden opportunity to act!
This response will also be an opportunity to draw public
attention to the need to preserve scientific literacy and to debunk existing
myths. 
You can help to re-establish the facts about climate change and,
more broadly, to guarantee the right to accurate, high-quality scientific
information, by funding this campaign. 



Message des panneaux

Les panneaux interpellent les panneaux de Friends of Science.


[billboard text: What science really says: The climate is changing. Because of us.]


Notre message s’appuie notamment sur les conclusions du cinquième rapport sur les changements climatiques du Groupe d’experts intergouvernemental sur l’évolution du climat (GIEC) précisant que « il est extrêmement probable que l'humain est la cause dominante du réchauffement climatique depuis la seconde moitié du 20ème siècle. »
Ce message a été validé par plusieurs scientifiques, journalistes, vulgarisateurs et muséologues scientifiques. 
Billboard message
The billboards will be reminiscent of the Friends of Science message.
Our message is based on the conclusions of the fifth assessment report on climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which states that humans are “extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.”
This message has been validated by many scientists, journalists, science writers, and science museum curators. 


Comment sera employé votre argent?
L'argent recueilli servira :

aux frais de production et d’affichage des panneaux;
à la location d’espace sur les autoroutes 440 et 40;
à la promotion de la campagne;
à la coordination de la campagne auprès des médias et des partenaires.

Au-delà de 10 000$ (cet objectif est maintenant atteint!), l’argent servira donc à poursuivre la mission d'ACS qui consiste notamment à:


dénoncer d'autres actions de désinformation scientifique ou de manipulation de l'information scientifique;


soutenir les communicateurs scientifiques québécois;
organiser des actions et mettre en place des outils visant à former les communicateurs scientifiques et le public pour répliquer aux faux arguments scientifiques et mieux déchiffrer l’actualité scientifique.

Une première page d'information sur les répliques aux arguments des climatosceptiques vient d'être mise en ligne: http://www.acs.qc.ca/actualite/168-comprendre-l... et nous traduisons nos documents en anglais.


How will your donation be used? 

The
funds we collect will go toward:



billboard production and display costs,



leasing of billboard space along Autoroutes 440 and 40,

campaign promotion,


campaign coordination with media and partners.



Beyond $10,000, the funds will go toward
continuing the mission of the ACS, which includes:


denouncing other instances of scientific misinformation or of
manipulation of scientific data, 


support Quebec's science communicators,
organizing actions and developing tools to teach scientific
communicators and the public how to respond to false scientific arguments and
better interpret science news. 





Qui sommes-nous?
L’Association des communicateurs scientifiques du Québec (ACS) est le plus important regroupement de professionnels de la communication scientifique au Québec. Ses membres exercent dans le milieu journalistique et muséal ainsi que dans le réseau des universités québécoises, les médias, les écoles et les lieux de diffusion scientifique.
Depuis 37 ans, l’ACS défend le droit à une information scientifique de qualité au Québec. Elle organise notamment la bourse Fernand-Seguin et le prix Hubert-Reeves.
En 2012, l’ACS a reçu le Prix de la liberté de presse par le Comité canadien pour la liberté de presse et une bourse décernée par la Commission canadienne de l’UNESCO pour avoir alerté le public et la communauté scientifique internationale sur le musèlement des scientifiques canadiens. (http://bit.ly/1FsuUom)

Cette campagne est organisée par une quinzaine de bénévoles, communicateurs et journalistes scientifiques, issus de tous les milieux : magazines, émissions de télé, musées, entreprises de vulgarisation, universités. 

Who are we?
The Québec association of scientific communicators (Association des communicateurs scientifiques
du Québec—ACS) is the largest science communication organization in Québec.
Its members work in journalism and museums as well as in Québec universities, the
media, schools, and anywhere scientific information is disseminated. 
For the past 37 years, the ACS has defended the right to
high-quality scientific information in Québec. It also awards the Fernand-Seguin
bursary and the Hubert-Reeves prize. 
In 2012, the ACS won the Press Freedom Prize, awarded
by the Canadian Committee for World Press Freedom, as well as a prize from the
Canadian Commission for UNESCO, for alerting the public and the international
scientific community to the muzzling of Canadian scientists. http://bit.ly/1FsuUom)


This campaign is being organized by 15 volunteers, scientific
communicators and science journalists from all sectors: magazines, TV programs,
museums, science adaptation companies, and universities. 

Risques et défis
L'ACS s'est engagée financièrement dans cette campagne d'affichage, avec des moyens plus que limités en ayant confiance que les Québécois seront derrière elle.
 
Risks and challenges


Even with its extremely limited funding, the ACS has made a
financial commitment to this billboard campaign, confident that Québecers will support it.

<p><em><strong><br/><br/></strong></em><strong>FULL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>Could it really be true that there is such a thing as an all-magnet motor that can provide rotational torque for useful energy generation, with no apparent input other than what nature provides through principles of magnetism not yet fully understood? Modern science emphatically says ""NO"", but many inventors over the years have claimed to have defied that prediction, by building working motors.<br/><br/> Now, at the 41st International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva from April 10-14, 2013, the world may have a chance to see such a motor.<br/><br/> The Turkish patent office has <a href=""http://pureenergyblog.com/2013/02/26/turkish-patent-institute-invites-yildiz-to-geneva-inventions-conference/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">invited</a> inventor Muammer Yildiz, to whom they awarded such a patent, to display his all-magnet motor at that expo; and he has invited me to participate in that event. The Turkish patent office is paying for Mr. Yildiz' trip.</p>
<p>As many of you who follow our Free Energy News know, I've been closely tracking the Yildiz all-magnet motor for the past few months, both in keeping a <a href=""http://peswiki.com/index.php/Event:2013:Validating_Muammer_Yildiz%27_Magnet_Motor_for_30_Days_at_European_University"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a> about it at PESWiki updated, as well as in helping to facilitate things through my interactions with the various players, including the inventor; his assistant, Halil Turkmen; the documentary film maker, Rene van der Woude of <a href=""http://www.mixr.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mixr.nl</a>; Dr. Jorge Duarte of Eindhoven University, who has been vouching for this technology; and a guy, who for now prefers to remain anonymous, from another university who is helping to coordinate the scientific validation; among others involved in coordinating this.<br/><br/> We all, especially the inventor, are anxious to finally see this technology class vindicated once and for all, to never be doubted again.<br/><br/> This would be the beginning of a new scientific and energy revolution -- a paradigm crasher, an eye opener, and the opening of a new path forward in providing clean solutions to the world's energy problems.<br/><br/> With all the interactions I have had on this, many of them confidential, I am very certain about the reality of Mr. Yildiz's motor design being real. <br/><br/> And I'm crossing my fingers that the technology will be able to get at least a minimal level of validation at the Geneva expo.<br/><br/> Most of the people I mentioned above have been probing around on this, and have a significant list of reasons why they are confident that the technology works.<br/><br/> What we can do, versus what will actually be displayed, has been the topic of much discussion behind the scenes, taking a wide range of variables into consideration, including politics of science, noise levels in the expo hall, safety issues, electronic magnetic memory erasing issues, feasibility of a scientifically credible environment for validation, possible alternate locations for moving the unit from the hall to a secondary location, feasibility of moving the set-up.<br/><br/> One of the limiting factors is that though the motors work, they have been built on a low budget and don't always have the best possible components, such as the bearings needed to withstand the forces generated. Though well advanced from the duct tape and bailing wire stage of prototyping, they are not ready for full-on stress testing.<br/><br/> While he is on this trip, following the Geneva expo, Mr. Yildiz wants to take the motor(s) to a university for proper scientific testing, and he doesn't want to jeopardize their operation by trying to show off too much at the expo. Nor does he want to risk the chance of a malfunction during a public display. So he is playing it very cautious.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What such a demonstration needs to prove is that for the size of the motor, there isn't anything in today's known scientific literature that could be concealed inside the motor that could possibly keep it running for as long as it is shown to be able to run.<br/><br/> The skeptics have been assuming that Mr. Yildiz has some kind of energy storage inside the motor cavity, by which he can show the shaft turning, but that he has not shown it running for long enough to rule out a hidden energy storage mechanism.</p>
<p><br/> A likely iteration will be the fan blade that Yildiz usually uses to demonstrate the technology. That motor body will be 14 cm in diameter and about 21 cm long, and the fan is 25 cm in diameter. <br/><br/><br/> Yildiz says that the longest he has ever run a motor without stopping was fifteen days, with witnesses. But he needs witnesses willing to go on record, with credentials.<br/><br/> In Geneva, in addition to the university personnel who plan to come, we can also have others sign in and sign out, with their signature and credentials, to add to the list of witnesses of the technology running continuously. And by having a tag-team type of pass-off by always having someone else take over where they left off, a net duration can be established, with many overlapping witnesses throughout.<br/><br/><strong>Open Source?<br/></strong><br/> Also, while in Geneva, I am looking forward to meeting in person with Mr. Yildiz to talk through the possibility of having an open license for people to be able to pursue lower power versions of the design without an up-front license, with the stipulation that they remit a royalty on all commercial roll-outs. He has been very favorable so far in these discussions.</p>

The Fishmobile bus is a traveling marine science program featuring live Chesapeake Bay animals, from toadfish to turtles.  It provides fun and exciting hands-on experiences for kids and adults.  Our one-of-a-kind program helps people to understand the environmental effects that people have on the Chesapeake Bay and its marine life.
Our formal Fishmobile education program is designed for students in Pre-K to 3rd grade. The Fishmobile also travels to summer camps, community festivals and corporate events, and even private events such as birthday parties.
Here is who we are:
At Phillips Wharf Environmental Center (PWEC) our mission is to inform, inspire, and involve people who live in the Chesapeake Bay region to become good stewards of America’s largest Bay. As children and adults encounter and interact with living Bay animals, they become aware of how the daily actions of each of the 17 million people in our area affect the Bay’s plants and animals.  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help: 
Help us to get the word out and make some noise about the Follow the Fishmobile campaign! Email and/or Facebook this campaign!  And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are a band of adventurers fundraising in order to participate in the charity Mongol Rally. Knowing each other since undergraduate studies, we are finally embarking on this epic journey. Dubbing ourselves ""the Flying Dutchmen"" and hopefully giving our car extra wings, our group consists of Matthias van de Raa, Nikolai Oudalov and Roeland van der Veen. An arduous race awaits us through some twenty countries traversing lakes, deserts, cities and mountain ranges until finally arriving in Ulan-Ude, Russia. While gas prices will decrease gradually, along with the cost of vodka until both are cheaper than clean water, we still need your help to get our little Suzuki all the way to Mongolia!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Who We Support</h3>
<p>We will be donating a minimum of 500 GBP of the campaign to the Ocean Cleanup, a project that has the ambitious goal of becoming the largest cleanup in history. They are developing advanced technologies to rid the world’s oceans of plastic, an amazing mission!</p>
<p>Our second charity is Cool Earth and will receive at least 500 GBP as well. Cool Earth is the official charity of the Mongol Rally and is supported by every team taking part in the race. They work to save the worlds rainforests by purchasing land and then leaving it in a local trust which they support with education, employment, and volunteers to protect the rainforest!</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $3000, with the first 1000 GBP going fully to our charities. If the donations exceed 1000 GBP, the rest will be evenly split between the two charities and ourselves, helping us making it safely to the other side of the world. This trip requires a massive amount of planning. We will be driving through harsh environments and fending off rogue traders on the Silk Route so there will be many things we will need for our trip. Anything from donations of equipment, tools, lodging, frequent flier miles, and anything else you cant think of would be greatly appreciated. The two easiest ways to help us is to donate directly to us here on our Indiegogo page (and potentially snag yourself a neat gift) or most importantly to GET THE WORD OUT!</p>
<p>Your donation here on our Indiegogo page will also help us cover a few of the initial fees and expenses involved in the Mongol Rally:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to pay a deposit to the company that runs the rally to ensure that the emergency response teams in Mongolia get something in the event our car isn't useable upon arrival in Mongolia</li>
<li>We need to buy our car and pay to register it and ensure it in every country we drive through.</li>
<li>We need visas to enter certain countries</li>
<li>We also need to pay for airfare back from the other side of the world, gas for our car, water and food, tons of supplies, and any unforeseen expenses</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>As a donor you will get one of our many sweet perks located to the right (our gratitude, funky souvenirs, original photographs, your name on our car or daring, funny, embarrassing activities you can make us do on camera) delivered in time for Christmas 2017. Note that you can also just make a donation, of any value, by clicking the pink 'Back it' button. In any case, you will get the satisfaction of knowing you helped ""the Flying Dutchmen"" make their wildest dreams come true while also helping fellow human beings worldwide!</p>

<p>Right now we are raising funds for Phase One. <i>We are seeking donations, personal loans, and cosigned mortgages to secure our community land.</i></p>
<p> We are planning to buy land in Burnsville, North Carolina, an hour away from Asheville. We are currently talking to a landowner who has a similar vision of ours and is inviting us to begin a community on her land.  We feel that securing funds for our land will exponentially open up possibilities for our future business and community collaboration.</p>

</div></div>","Updated Letters of Interest
Although this is a ""crowdfund"" more importantly are ""pledges"" which are a $2 minimum to show your support for our cause to investors and other potential partners. Secondly, ""letters of interest"" are pertinent to land our project. Scroll to the bottom for details.
Here are our updated Letters of Interest:
- Hempknowlogy has been developing our blue print plans for our conference center. He wants to partner with us to develop 3D printed houses and sprayed hempcrete buildings.
-Ernest Hancock has expressed explicit interest in helping find and donate materials to build inhabitable domes on our property
-Josh Graveling, Yurt and Tiny house builder, has pledged to help build yurts and other glamping buildings onsite.
-We have one potential cosigner on our mortgage
-We have a landowner who wants to collaborate in community and business on her land. 
-Three people have expressed interest in owning shares in our business. 
- Solar Punk Festival & Global Ecovillage Network have expressed interest in hosting events onsite.
Short Summary
Many of you are visiting this crowdfund because you believe in us. You have followed Leonie’s and/or Chloe’s journey for many years. If that is the case, then you understand that we have reached a pivotal point in our life! We are ready to launch our ecovillage dream! We are so excited to share our plan with our family, friends, and peers. 
Who are we?

Learn more about us here


(Scroll below to see more about our ecovillage project and strategy plan) 
Ecovillages are flourishing spaces for innovation in the dimensions of sustainability, economic, and social wellbeing. 
If you are unfamiliar with our journey below are a few reasons to consider supporting our project.
Ecovillages | A Positive Impact
Ecovillages have set a precedent for human and ecological development. We want to encourage this trend! 
At Dancing Rabbit each member on average uses 82% less electricity than an average US citizen per year. They also travel 90% less miles per year than the average US person. 
 


Despite Covid, many communities were able to have daily interactions if they quarantined collectively or had outdoor activities together 
An ecovillage in New Hampshire, La Cite Ecologique made over 8 Million Dollars in 2019 while sustaining over 68 jobs for locals. 


Our Timeline

*Disclaimer* Phases may change based on our current agreements with landowners and funds raised. Please join our calls for more information. 


Our Targets Summarized
(Learn more in our document with data and detailed targets here) 
Our ecovillage will be monitored based on targets set and correlating data that we accumulate.

 
Our Fundraising Ask
Right now we are raising funds for Phase One. We are seeking donations, personal loans, and cosigned mortgages to secure our community land.
 We are planning to buy land in Burnsville, North Carolina, an hour away from Asheville. We are currently talking to a landowner who has a similar vision of ours and is inviting us to begin a community on her land.  We feel that securing funds for our land will exponentially open up possibilities for our future business and community collaboration.
Our Infastructure
Below are some images of our planned spaces (renders coming soon).
Hempcrete Conference Center & Home Sites  - 
With natural materials & systems including hempcrete

<p>Wow, how exciting, I am set to graduate from UVIC with my BA in Coastal Geography and, what a way to finish. I will have completed my degree and now i've been given the most incredible opportunity to teach scuba diving and help develop a sustainable fisheries managment plan... In Mozambique Africa!! This is more than a dream.</p>
<p>I will be living at a small 9 room eco-lodge <a href=""http://www.guludo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.guludo.com</a>. The concept of the lodge is fair trade, and with only a few foreign management staff the lodge employs close to 80 locals and contracts with over 150 local suppliers. The hotel has won two conde nast awards for poverty alleviation and education, and has been recognized for work with children and water.</p>
<p>I will be volunteering with the Nema foundation, owned by the same founders as Guludo, thier charity provides clean access to drinking water for over 20000 peoplev promotes health throught education and feeds 800 school children a day.

I really appreciate anything you can contribute to my journey!</p>

<p><strong>The Cost</strong></p>
<p>To fly round trip Vancouver to Mozambique is $3000, To get the visa I must have a round-trip ticket. After travel insurance and medical shots, it will probably be close to $4000. I am asking for $1500 to help fund my plane ticket. And truly anything you can contribute, even ~ good vibes ~ are humbly accepted with an open heart!</p>
<p> Room and board at Guludo are paid for by the lodge but I must cover all expenses to get to Africa. I am going first as a volunteer with the posiblity of a small salary after a few months. Any help you can contribute I truly appreciate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Overfishing is a global concern, and an estimated 70% of global fisheries are in decline, exploited or being overfished, and in places like Mozambique one of the poorest countries in the world, fish is the primary protein source for coastal communities like Guludo. The question of sustainable fisheries is then of the most importance as it supports social, and economic livelihoods. Recent discovered of oil and gas in the region has contributed to the countries 10 year impressive growth rate however more business means more people and this has resulted in an increased demand on local fish stocks. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to work WITH communities and help develop conservation goals for fisheries preservation for future generation. </p>
<p>Guludo lodge is described by the owner as ""barefoot eco-chic""</p>
<p>There is no electricity, no running water and its a few hours from the closest town. This is an absolute adventure and I am so ready to take on the challenge.</p>
<p>I will be scuba diving and helping to expand a humpback whale program from July - November and I’ve read that Mozambique has some very amazing coral. This is the perfect way for my to combine my PADI instructor training and now my almost!!! finished undergraduate degree &lt;3</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I am a junior at University of Puget Sound. I have wanted to study abroad since I graduated high school, but unfortunately on the educational track and financial restraints I am under, I decided my needs would best be suited by volunteering with G.I.V.E for 2 weeks this summer.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Volunteer initiatives include a large scale fresh water project, as well as providing water filtration systems for a small town that does not have clean drinking water. We are also building secondary schools and teaching english and vocational skills to children, as well as funding teachers to educate students year round. We are building homes for families that have been displaced due to a devastating tsunami. We will be working with doctors promoting basic health education and providing medical supplies. We will be doing a crocodile catch-and-release program to allow the crocs to breed in captivity, and also collecting endangered Hawks Bill turtle eggs to help increase their chances of survival. We are also implementing sustainable gardening methods and building gardens. None of this is charity - we are teaching the people of this region to be able to help themselves and raise their standard of living.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Read more about the volunteer initiatives here: <a href=""http://www.givevolunteers.org/volunteer-initiatives.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.givevolunteers.org/volunteer-initiatives.html</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The program, including flight costs and traveler's insurance (required) I'm estimating to be $2000. This is not a conservative estimate. I fear costs may exceed this number, so everything is appreciated. I have already submitted a $375 deposit, and if I do not raise the money, I do not get this money back. As a college student any wasted money, especially such a large amount, makes my life much more difficult.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money I raise will go toward the overall program cost ($1875) as well as travel costs to and from Miami and from Miami to Nicaragua. Traveler's insurance is also required. If I do not meet my goal, I have some money in savings, but as a college student, using this money for anything other than my future would be a huge financial setback. I am attending a private university and paying for it all myself. This means taking out loans in <i>my</i> name (not my parents) and working as well as attending school full time.<br/><br/>I will be selling knit items! I know that come April people will not need gloves and hats and scarves (etc) as much as they need them now, but I assure you that they will be high quality and will serve you well for many years. I also have several other people who have offered to sew, crochet, and even do henna to help me raise money for this excursion. Contact me if you would like something made for you you don't see in the ""perks"" section. All prices are subject to negotiation or change depending on difficulty. If you see something you like or have an idea of something you want, let me know! I'm always up to try making something I haven't tried before.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Tell anyone who is interested in helping people in 3rd world countries. Not just for survival, but for promoting social equality and education and self-sustainability. Also tell anyone who loves local handmade crafts!</p>

We are building homes for families that have been displaced due to a devastating tsunami. We will be working with doctors promoting basic health education and providing medical supplies. We will be doing a crocodile catch-and-release program to allow the crocs to breed in captivity, and also collecting endangered Hawks Bill turtle eggs to help increase their chances of survival. We are also implementing sustainable gardening methods and building gardens. None of this is charity - we are teaching the people of this region to be able to help themselves and raise their standard of living.

The program, including flight costs and traveler's insurance (required) I'm estimating to be $2000. This is not a conservative estimate. I fear costs may exceed this number, so everything is appreciated. I have already submitted a $375 deposit, and if I do not raise the money, I do not get this money back. As a college student any wasted money, especially such a large amount, makes my life much more difficult.


What We Need & What You Get
The money I raise will go toward the overall program cost ($1875) as well as travel costs to and from Miami and from Miami to Nicaragua. Traveler's insurance is also required. If I do not meet my goal, I have some money in savings, but as a college student, using this money for anything other than my future would be a huge financial setback. I am attending a private university and paying for it all myself. This means taking out loans in my name (not my parents) and working as well as attending school full time.I will be selling knit items! I know that come April people will not need gloves and hats and scarves (etc) as much as they need them now, but I assure you that they will be high quality and will serve you well for many years. I also have several other people who have offered to sew, crochet, and even do henna to help me raise money for this excursion. Contact me if you would like something made for you you don't see in the ""perks"" section. All prices are subject to negotiation or change depending on difficulty. If you see something you like or have an idea of something you want, let me know! I'm always up to try making something I haven't tried before.

I set up Seed Exchange stations in progressive businesses around the county.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I was not sure if this was going to work, but at the end of the season, 95% of the seed donated was traded by new and experienced gardeners! <i>Seed got into the hands of people who needed it to feed their families.</i></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I'd like to expand my operations in 2014 and offer things Taos County gardeners asked for: non-GMO and organic seed to buy, nursery starts, drought tolerant plants for water conservation, native plants to attract bees, and workshops. </span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>Detail of the Seed Exchange station at More Pieces, a consignment store:</b></i></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/244809/files/20131205171444-13.2.28_pieces_more_5153.jpg?1386292484"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i style=""font-weight: normal;""></i></p><h3>What Taos Wants in 2014</h3><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In order to give local gardeners what they want, I would like to raise $25,000 for the 2014 season and beyond!

People gave me energy, time and material offerings, all of which you can't put a monetary value on.If you would still like to make a donation towards this worthwhile project, you can contact me via email. Thanks to everyone who shared a kind word and made donations during this process! Onward into the gardening season!Jan 29, 2014 Update:ONLY 2 MORE DAYS in this campaign! We are down to the final hours! I have received SO much from so many people, and I appreciate every word, every gesture, every share, every dollar. The Taos Seed Exchange will blossom in 2014, and you can be proud you helped! Please continue to share these ideas of helping Taos gardeners grow with seeds, plants, workshops and gardening info. I need your help to put great and necessary things into my community. When you share, I can share. The Taos Seed Exchange started on sharing, and it will continue to grow in an atmosphere of sharing. Thank you!Jan 26, 2014 Update:There are ONLY 4 MORE DAYS in this campaign! Great news, too! The Seed Exchange stations have been successfully taken care of! Please see the email updates for details. It's onward to the next project to get rolling, a Seed Swap. Your donations will help me rent the perfect venue and find the perfect food to serve!Please donate towards this event and future events that help gardeners blossom! If all my friends and you and all your friends donated a mere $5, we could make a huge difference in the Taos gardening scene!ONLY 4 MORE DAYS! It's down to the wire! I am blessed that so much has come my way. With your donations, I can pay it forward. Thank you!Jan 25, 2014 Update:Happy National Seed Swap Day! In honor of this day, I have set up a Seed Exchange station in a local food co-op, the Dixon Market!There are boxes for seeds and envelopes for disbursing them. A how-to poster hangs above. It's a simple set-up, but serves an entire community 30 miles south of Taos. Dixon is considered a food desert, because it is so far from a large grocery store. A Seed Exchange station will help residents grow food and save seed.Boxes are decorated with pictures from old seed catalogs. Seeds were donated by several non-GMO seed companies, and some of the seed was grown out locally last year. Instructions are clear with photos. People bring in their seed and trade it for something that's new to them! Happy seed swapping!Thanks for your continued support!Each station will have a retail seed rack for people who want to supplement what they find in the exchange or to buy as a trade item. I used the kickstarter money donated so far to buy this rack from Renee's Garden Seeds. It is a beautiful display, and the customers and staff in the store were excited to have my project there!Kickstarter money also bought this countertop display of Renee's Garden Seeds at a consignment store called ReThreads, too! Thank you for your continued support! Donations are being used already! Jan 20, 2014 Update:Happy Martin Luther King Jr Day! Get inspired fearlessly!This campaign runs for only 10 MORE DAYS! Read the updates that I email out to see what we're doing and where we're going. We are getting lots of media exposure, and there is much more to come! Consider a Sponsorship as a way to advertise your business. I am also listing all donors on my website within the next couple of days. Thanks for your support! Scroll down for details about the Taos Seed Exchange, if this is your first visit!Jan 16, 2014 Update:Howdy, and thanks for visiting!The campaign runs for only TWO MORE WEEKS! Please donate and spread the word to everyone you know! Encourage them to get involved with donations and sharing. Every penny that comes in will be put to good use to ensure that Taos gardeners have what they need, be it seed, plants or information.I am getting very busy with seed orders and planting plans. It is going to be a prosperous year! Thank you so much for being part of it! Greetings!My name is Nan Fischer, and I started the Taos Seed Exchange in Taos, New Mexico last winter. It is a free community service for home gardeners to swap seeds. It's very simple - gardeners bring seed to a Seed Exchange station and trade it for something they need or something they want to experiment with. Simple! I want to expand the number of stations in 2014 and add retail seed racks of organic and non-GMO seeds. This is what Taos gardeners have requested! I'd also like to provide nursery starts, drought tolerant plants that attract bees, gardening workshops, movies, and a spring seed swap.With your generous donations, I'd like to raise $25,000 to help Taos County gardeners grow food! In return, you could receive a gift certificate good towards all products and services, non-GMO seeds, nursery starts grown without pesticides, CSA shares of starts and seeds delivered to you at planting time, or your business name prominently displayed at a station and in all the marketing materials!What I Did in 2013The Taos Seed Exchange was started with $200 of my own money and 200 of my spare-time hours. Hundreds of pounds of seed were donated by a few seed companies and many local seed-saving gardeners. I set up Seed Exchange stations in progressive businesses around the county.I was not sure if this was going to work, but at the end of the season, 95% of the seed donated was traded by new and experienced gardeners! Seed got into the hands of people who needed it to feed their families.I'd like to expand my operations in 2014 and offer things Taos County gardeners asked for: non-GMO and organic seed to buy, nursery starts, drought tolerant plants for water conservation, native plants to attract bees, and workshops. Detail of the Seed Exchange station at More Pieces, a consignment store:What Taos Wants in 2014In order to give local gardeners what they want, I would like to raise $25,000 for the 2014 season and beyond! These items are in order of importance: > Buy seed to put in the Seed Exchange stations. With the number of stations increasing, I need more seed than I can garner through donations. I already bought 50 packets of seed from Johnny's and Seed Savers Exchange, and I'd like to be able to buy more. > Buy seed for resale. Since the Taos Seed Exchange doesn't provide all the seed gardeners need, I want to offer seed for sale along with each Seed Exchange station. All seed would be non-GMO and open-pollinated for seed saving, and organic where possible.> Hire someone to build stations, customized for each location. I already have 7 businesses committed to the 2014 growing season, and after the holidays I will be contacting more to expand further. My goal is 10 stations this year.It will cost between $700-1500 per station to set them up. This is the biggest financial need I have - buying seed and building stations with all the supplies.Once those expenses are taken care of, these are the next in line to be funded:> Buy supplies for growing starts: 6-packs, 4"" pots, trays, seed, soil, fertilizer and a cold frame. Ideally, I need a bigger greenhouse, but before I can build that, I need to drill a private well (I'm on a well-share). I also want to grow and sell native and drought tolerant shrubs and perennials.> Sponsor a large seed swap in the spring with food, music, and gardening products for sale.> Hire local gardeners to give workshops on starting seed, soil health, gardening for bees, seed saving, putting food up for winter and so on - all segments of a growing season.> Sponsor food and gardening related movies at our independent local theater.> Contract with local artisans to create planters, solar food dehydrators, small greenhouses and other products.Please Donate and Spread the Word!As Monsanto buys up small seed companies and threatens small farmers with extinction, we must share seeds! Neighbor-to-neighbor and gardener-to-gardener seed sharing is a hedge against Monsanto and increases our community's food security. It also contributes to our local food system.In the name of educating new gardeners to get them started, helping experienced gardeners trade their huge seed stashes, and getting seeds and plants into the hands of people eager to take control of their food source, PLEASE HELP!

We are a member of the United Nations Environment Program's South South Exchange Mechanism. Our mission is to support the Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) of the Pacific Islands. ESD requires all of society to work together - business, civil sector, NGO's, government, individuals and grant bodies - to build and support sustainable economic activities that generate ongoing livelihoods for generations to come. We have partnered with Taste of Tonga to help fund a Biomass Generator because this island business is a shining example of ESD, Renewable Energy Use, Zero Waste, South South Exchange, Fair Trade and it is Up-scalable. Taste of Tonga is an unusual business based on the
isolated South Pacific island of Vava’u, The Kingdom of Tonga. Our focus is on
developing a process that maximises the value of a coconut with a goal of zero
waste. Vava’u has many coconuts and most go to waste as there is no industry in
Vava’u that uses coconuts. Our mission is to produce quality products from the
coconuts for export, replace imported products with locally produced
alternatives and provide over 300 Tongan families with a sustainable
income.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>Ian and Vanessa's Story:</b></span></p>
<p>When we  (
Ian and Vanessa Jones) decided to move to Vava’u we did so with a specific aim
to add value to the local community. Our aim was to start a business that
capitalises on unused capacity and lost assets of Vava’u. We quickly identified
two opportunities, an abundant supply of coconuts and 300 plus idle vanilla
plantations that had been overrun by the tropical jungle.
Our vision was to reactivate these two industries and establish a zero waste,
environmentally friendly, organic, export and import replacement business that
engages the grass root Tongan families. </p>
<p>Many of the people in Tonga live below the poverty
line. They have access to land, coconuts and vanilla but they have not been
able to establish a market for their produce or access the capital to restore
their plantations to productive capacity. It is from this foundation we began.
We decided to put all our efforts into activating the lost assets of Vava’u and
create a new sustainable income source for Tongan families.</p>
<p>The project commenced in September 2012. We
established a proof of concept Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) factory. The success of
the factory then led to the commencement of the vanilla plantation restoration
in 2013. With the assistance of Queen Fine Foods, (<a href=""http://www.queen.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.queen.com.au</a>) we
motivated almost 300 plantation owners to return to their vanilla plantations
and recover the vanilla vines from the jungle and recommence production. Queen
Fine Foods guaranteed the growers a market for their vanilla at a price
substantially higher than the Fair Trade International guidelines. The farmers
jumped at the opportunity to return to their vanilla with 98% participation.</p>
<p>In 2014 we scaled up the Virgin Coconut Oil factory
to a level where we can produce 4,000 litres of oil each month. This requires
us to process 60,000 coconuts every month and in turn deal with the waste from
the coconut oil production.</p>
<p>By processing 60,000 coconuts to create  4,000 litres of VCO each month we end up with
63.9 ton of coconut husk, 13.8 ton of coconut shells, 10,115 litres of coconut
water,11.7 ton of pressed coconut flakes and 1,445 litres of coconut protein. Disposing
or the waste was a big problem and at the same time offered a ton of potential.</p>
<p>Many hours of research on Google and YouTube has
brought us to a point where today. The project is near completion and the goal
of zero waste is close to a reality.</p>
<p><b>The Zero
Waste Process</b></p>
<p>Over the past two years we have gradually built a
herd of almost 100 pigs and they all love coconuts. The pigs are the foundation
of our waste utilisation plan.</p>
<p>However, we should start at the beginning, where a vanilla
farmer collects and sells his coconuts to Taste of Tonga. </p>
<p>Our first step in the process is to remove the husk
from the coconut. Once removed the husk is returned to the vanilla plantations and
used as mulch for the vanilla vines. The vanilla vines are an orchid and they
feed off decaying plant material and coconut husk is perfect nutrition for
vanilla vines.</p>
<p><b>The hard coconut
shell is then removed and put to the side and this is the subject of this
promotion which we will come back to.</b></p>
<p>The water inside the coconut is collected and
turned into coconut vinegar or added to the pig feed: the white flesh of the
coconut is ground and pressed to acquire the coconut milk, the flesh (post
press) goes into pig porridge. The coconut cream is fermented and we then
extract the virgin coconut oil and filter it ready for export. We are now left
with residual coconut protein that is added to the pig porridge or fed into a
maggot farm. </p><p></p><p>The maggots are 63% protein and are almost the
perfect food for chickens and ducks, they just love a good feed on coconut fed
maggots.</p>
<p>The chickens, ducks and pigs are mostly free
ranging over 8 acres. They have a very natural life however are eventually cured
in Tongan sea salt and smoked with coconut husk to create tasty hams and small
goods.</p>
<p>From time to time some of the pigs go to a special
pig resort where we collect their poop for a biogas plant that will produce
methane gas to run the burners that heat the coconut oil where we make our taro
and cassava chips. The taro and cassava peelings are added to the pig porridge.</p>
<p>The waste liquid from the bio gas digester is piped
to the vegetable garden and used as liquid organic fertilizer. Surplus vegetables
from the garden are fed to the chickens, ducks and pigs.</p>
<p>In the future, waste from the slaughter of the pigs,
ducks and chickens will be fed into a mud crab farm. The mud crabs will be sold
locally on the condition that the shells are returned so they may be ground up
and added to the chicken and duck feed as a calcium supplement for egg shell
production.</p>
<p>Feathers from the chickens and ducks will be ground
up and added to the pig feed as a further protein supplement.</p>
<p>At this point we have achieved ZERO waste except
for the coconut shells that have been put to the side. The shells will be
turned into electricity using the biomass generator.</p>
<p></p>

provide added competitiveness we need to effectively utilise the 13.8 ton of coconut
shells that have been put to the side each month.</p>
<p>The options could include turning the shells into
charcoal and then into activated carbon for export however we decided that
turning them into electricity would be more beneficial in our island community.
</p>
<p>Electricity is expensive in Tonga due to the fact
that it is made by large generators running off imported diesel; this is neither
sustainable nor desirable. </p>
<p>By employing a gasifier it is possible to convert
the shells into syngass which in turn runs an engine that drives a generator
that can produce electricity. This is nothing new and has been around since the
1930’s. The gasifier will produce sufficient electricity to operate the VCO
factory and the Vanilla Curing Facility. Surplus electricity will be fed onto
the grid to further reduce the need for imported diesel.</p>
<p>The gasifier we wish to install is called a Power
Pallet. It is produced in the USA by All Power Labs (<a href=""http://www.gekgasifier.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.gekgasifier.com</a>).
This unit in operational in many different countries around the world and is a
perfect fit for small Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>The cost to establish an operational 20 kW gasifier
in Vava’u is:</p>
<p>GasifierUSD$29,995</p>
<p>Grid tie equipment USD $9,990</p>
<p>Import Duties USD $6,000</p>
<p>Freight USD $2,200</p>
<p>Housing structure  USD $1,800</p><p>Contingency 10%</p>
<p><b>Total
USD $54,983.50</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>To date we have invested almost USD $200,000 into
this project and whilst we are selling virgin coconut oil and vanilla beans,
production is not at a level where they can accumulate sufficient capital to
complete our dream of a Zero Waste operation.</p>
<p>Expensive electricity and freight is keeping our
operational costs high making our products more expensive against low cost
producing countries like Indonesia and Phillippines with cheap labour,
electricity and shipping. The gasifier will remove the energy cost and perhaps
create a new income source thus leveling the playing field.</p>
<p>We are passionate about this project, its success
will impact on the livelihood of over 300 Tongan subsistence farmers of which
many live below the poverty line. We have come this far and need a little help
to finish the project.</p>
<p>We are happy to receive any amount of
contribution, and are happy to provide you with a few perks in recognition
of your generous contribution and support.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p><p></p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>The Taste of Tonga project is to educating people
about developing sustainable businesses that have a minimal impact on the
environment and at the same time maximise the utilisation of available renewable resources, as well as waste resources.</p>
<p>By establishing this centre we aim to transform the
lives of many poverty stricken families by helping them to capitalise on the
lost assets within their communities.</p>
<p>Once completed we will open our doors to anyone
interested in learning the process. We will provide them with detailed
instructions on how to achieve all or individual components of the project. We
want Taste of Tonga to become a centre of learning, a place where people can
see and understand the concept of sustainable business and waste utilisation.</p><p><b>Pacific Aid Australia</b> will also publish the names of all donors on a dedicated webpage - with donor permission of course. And we will film the delivery, installation and operation of the Biomass Generator and post it on You Tube, our website, and other social media channels for all supporters to see the fruits of their support.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you can’t contribute, that doesn't mean you can’t help.

the factory then led to the commencement of the vanilla plantation restoration
in 2013. With the assistance of Queen Fine Foods, (www.queen.com.au) we
motivated almost 300 plantation owners to return to their vanilla plantations
and recover the vanilla vines from the jungle and recommence production. Queen
Fine Foods guaranteed the growers a market for their vanilla at a price
substantially higher than the Fair Trade International guidelines. The farmers
jumped at the opportunity to return to their vanilla with 98% participation.
In 2014 we scaled up the Virgin Coconut Oil factory
to a level where we can produce 4,000 litres of oil each month. This requires
us to process 60,000 coconuts every month and in turn deal with the waste from
the coconut oil production.
By processing 60,000 coconuts to create  4,000 litres of VCO each month we end up with
63.9 ton of coconut husk, 13.8 ton of coconut shells, 10,115 litres of coconut
water,11.7 ton of pressed coconut flakes and 1,445 litres of coconut protein. Disposing
or the waste was a big problem and at the same time offered a ton of potential.
Many hours of research on Google and YouTube has
brought us to a point where today. The project is near completion and the goal
of zero waste is close to a reality.
The Zero
Waste Process
Over the past two years we have gradually built a
herd of almost 100 pigs and they all love coconuts. The pigs are the foundation
of our waste utilisation plan.
However, we should start at the beginning, where a vanilla
farmer collects and sells his coconuts to Taste of Tonga. 
Our first step in the process is to remove the husk
from the coconut. Once removed the husk is returned to the vanilla plantations and
used as mulch for the vanilla vines. The vanilla vines are an orchid and they
feed off decaying plant material and coconut husk is perfect nutrition for
vanilla vines.
The hard coconut
shell is then removed and put to the side and this is the subject of this
promotion which we will come back to.
The water inside the coconut is collected and
turned into coconut vinegar or added to the pig feed: the white flesh of the
coconut is ground and pressed to acquire the coconut milk, the flesh (post
press) goes into pig porridge. The coconut cream is fermented and we then
extract the virgin coconut oil and filter it ready for export. We are now left
with residual coconut protein that is added to the pig porridge or fed into a
maggot farm. The maggots are 63% protein and are almost the
perfect food for chickens and ducks, they just love a good feed on coconut fed
maggots.
The chickens, ducks and pigs are mostly free
ranging over 8 acres. They have a very natural life however are eventually cured
in Tongan sea salt and smoked with coconut husk to create tasty hams and small
goods.
From time to time some of the pigs go to a special
pig resort where we collect their poop for a biogas plant that will produce
methane gas to run the burners that heat the coconut oil where we make our taro
and cassava chips. The taro and cassava peelings are added to the pig porridge.
The waste liquid from the bio gas digester is piped
to the vegetable garden and used as liquid organic fertilizer. Surplus vegetables
from the garden are fed to the chickens, ducks and pigs.
In the future, waste from the slaughter of the pigs,
ducks and chickens will be fed into a mud crab farm. The mud crabs will be sold
locally on the condition that the shells are returned so they may be ground up
and added to the chicken and duck feed as a calcium supplement for egg shell
production.
Feathers from the chickens and ducks will be ground
up and added to the pig feed as a further protein supplement.
At this point we have achieved ZERO waste except
for the coconut shells that have been put to the side. The shells will be
turned into electricity using the biomass generator.

Mud crabsWhat We Need & What You GetTo fulfill our objective of ZERO waste and to
provide added competitiveness we need to effectively utilise the 13.8 ton of coconut
shells that have been put to the side each month.
The options could include turning the shells into
charcoal and then into activated carbon for export however we decided that
turning them into electricity would be more beneficial in our island community.

Electricity is expensive in Tonga due to the fact
that it is made by large generators running off imported diesel; this is neither
sustainable nor desirable. 
By employing a gasifier it is possible to convert
the shells into syngass which in turn runs an engine that drives a generator
that can produce electricity. This is nothing new and has been around since the
1930’s. The gasifier will produce sufficient electricity to operate the VCO
factory and the Vanilla Curing Facility. Surplus electricity will be fed onto
the grid to further reduce the need for imported diesel.
The gasifier we wish to install is called a Power
Pallet. It is produced in the USA by All Power Labs (http://www.gekgasifier.com).
This unit in operational in many different countries around the world and is a
perfect fit for small Pacific Islands.
The cost to establish an operational 20 kW gasifier
in Vava’u is:
GasifierUSD$29,995
Grid tie equipment USD $9,990
Import Duties USD $6,000
Freight USD $2,200
Housing structure  USD $1,800Contingency 10%
Total
USD $54,983.50

To date we have invested almost USD $200,000 into
this project and whilst we are selling virgin coconut oil and vanilla beans,
production is not at a level where they can accumulate sufficient capital to
complete our dream of a Zero Waste operation.
Expensive electricity and freight is keeping our
operational costs high making our products more expensive against low cost
producing countries like Indonesia and Phillippines with cheap labour,
electricity and shipping. The gasifier will remove the energy cost and perhaps
create a new income source thus leveling the playing field.
We are passionate about this project, its success
will impact on the livelihood of over 300 Tongan subsistence farmers of which
many live below the poverty line. We have come this far and need a little help
to finish the project.
We are happy to receive any amount of
contribution, and are happy to provide you with a few perks in recognition
of your generous contribution and support.The Impact
The
Impact
The Taste of Tonga project is to educating people
about developing sustainable businesses that have a minimal impact on the
environment and at the same time maximise the utilisation of available renewable resources, as well as waste resources.
By establishing this centre we aim to transform the
lives of many poverty stricken families by helping them to capitalise on the
lost assets within their communities.
Once completed we will open our doors to anyone
interested in learning the process. We will provide them with detailed
instructions on how to achieve all or individual components of the project. We
want Taste of Tonga to become a centre of learning, a place where people can
see and understand the concept of sustainable business and waste utilisation.Pacific Aid Australia will also publish the names of all donors on a dedicated webpage - with donor permission of course. And we will film the delivery, installation and operation of the Biomass Generator and post it on You Tube, our website, and other social media channels for all supporters to see the fruits of their support.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can’t contribute, that doesn't mean you can’t help. You can help by:
Asking your friends, your company, people you know how are passionate about environmental issues, islands, sustainable development etc to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.
Please use all the Indiegogo share tools on the social media sites you use

<h2><strong>Help make a historic green map for the Royal Borough of Greenwich, and become a named supporter!</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re creating a bold, beautiful <strong>London National Park City* Greenwich</strong> map featuring all the wonderful open and green spaces in the borough. Through the map we aim to connect people to nature and to improve awareness of the wealth of open and green spaces in South East London—from Cutty Sark to Thamesmead to Beckenham Place Park. The map draws attention to new, fun and creative ways to explore London, such as the Green Chain Walk or the Woolwich Ferry across the Thames. Packed with historic walks, cycle trails, and fun facts about Greenwich’s amazing outdoors, the Greenwich map will be a unique tool for residents and visitors to use to discover a historic part of London in a different way.</p>
<p>To fund the creation of the Greenwich map, we are offering advanced copies and beautiful original, limited edition prints of London. Greenwich will be the first borough-scale National Park City map and will connect locals and visitors to green opportunities for living, working and playing in Greenwich.</p>
<p>Like the London National Park City map that we created in 2017 to support London becoming the world’s first National Park City, the Greenwich map will be a large-format, folded paper map – printed by Dennis Maps. The borough-level map will be much more detailed, to highlight the richness of the area and connect residents and visitors to all that Greenwich and its surrounds have to offer. The map will be a beautiful, unique and custom-drawn map, highlighting places to explore such as parks, green roofs, the canals, places to work, relax and sport outdoors, city farms for children and much more! The reverse side of the map will be used to provide more information and key facts about Greenwich and London National Park City.</p>

</div></div>","Help make a historic green map for the Royal Borough of Greenwich, and become a named supporter!
 
We’re creating a bold, beautiful London National Park City* Greenwich map featuring all the wonderful open and green spaces in the borough. Through the map we aim to connect people to nature and to improve awareness of the wealth of open and green spaces in South East London—from Cutty Sark to Thamesmead to Beckenham Place Park. The map draws attention to new, fun and creative ways to explore London, such as the Green Chain Walk or the Woolwich Ferry across the Thames. Packed with historic walks, cycle trails, and fun facts about Greenwich’s amazing outdoors, the Greenwich map will be a unique tool for residents and visitors to use to discover a historic part of London in a different way.
To fund the creation of the Greenwich map, we are offering advanced copies and beautiful original, limited edition prints of London. Greenwich will be the first borough-scale National Park City map and will connect locals and visitors to green opportunities for living, working and playing in Greenwich.
Like the London National Park City map that we created in 2017 to support London becoming the world’s first National Park City, the Greenwich map will be a large-format, folded paper map – printed by Dennis Maps. The borough-level map will be much more detailed, to highlight the richness of the area and connect residents and visitors to all that Greenwich and its surrounds have to offer. The map will be a beautiful, unique and custom-drawn map, highlighting places to explore such as parks, green roofs, the canals, places to work, relax and sport outdoors, city farms for children and much more! The reverse side of the map will be used to provide more information and key facts about Greenwich and London National Park City.
Our goal is to distribute well over 5,000 London National Park City* Greenwich maps, with maps in every school, recreation centre, doctor’s surgery and library in the borough, to reach as many people as possible!
The Greenwich map will launch in July to coincide with the London National Park City festival—20th-28th July.

<p>My name is John Beaudry. I am raising money to create a film that will give voice to the Achuar people of Ecuador. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achuar_people"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Achuar</strong> </a>are a group of indigenous peoples in the Amazon, with a rich, ancient culture. They are working to preserve their environment and community.Their territory encompasses 5 million acres of pristine tropical rainforest. Until the 1970’s, they lived untouched by the modern world. </p>
<p><em>""This is not just about one battle in one corner of the Amazon. This is about drawing a line in the sand for indigenous people and rainforests everywhere. It's about ensuring that indigenous people can fulfill the role they see for themselves as protectors of the natural world in partnership with all of us.""</em><br/>- Bill Twist, CEO of The Pachamama Alliance, partner organization of Fundación Pachamama in the US.</p>

<h2><strong>Five Million Acres of Rainforest are at Risk for New Oil Development in 2012.</strong></h2>
<p>These five million acres of pristine rainforest are now at critical risk. This land is home to six different indigenous nations who have not been informed nor given their consent. The land in question is sandwiched between two of the largest ecological and human rights disasters in recent history.</p>
<p>Just 100 miles away, in Ecuador’s northern Amazon basin, oil exploitation conducted by Chevron/Texaco and Ecuador’s state-owned oil company devastated the forest ecology and the indigenous societies of the rainforest.</p>
<p>Though their home may seem remote, the forests in which they have lived for thousands of years are the lungs of our planet. And we cannot live without them. The Achuar people are taking a stand for the natural world on the behalf of all of us to save the lives of all people who rely on the lungs of the world.</p>
<p><strong>This is</strong> <strong>a call for our time</strong>.</p>
<p>With the support of a global community, the Achuar have successfully defended their land for 15 years—in spite of intense pressure from an array of international oil companies.</p>

<p>I believe in a world where everyone’s needs are met.</p>
<p>I believe that ancient ways of life can intersect with the techno-industrial world in a way that will benefit Everyone. That’s a capitol E for Everyone, meaning all people.</p>
<p>I believe that you and I, as individuals, are greater than we can ever imagine.</p>
<p>I am a horticulturist, garden designer, landscape contractor, author, and global activist who loves life, nature, his husband, and his dog. And I love people.</p>
<p>I am writing a book on garden design called <em>Designing the Bungalow Garden: How to Create Gardens and Lives Rooted in Spirit</em>.10% of the proceeds from the book go to the Pachamama Alliance. The book is based on the Arts and Crafts Movement that was, in part, a rebellion in response to the industrial revolution. Early founders of the movement advocated for a better life for factory workers. Lured by the promise of steady work and pay, the industrial revolution pulled individuals away from their agrarian lives. Their new lives in factories lacked, among many other things, a relationship with nature—a life in harmony with the rhythms of nature. It is in the rhythms of the natural world, where we find the connection to our own true nature.</p>
<p>One hundred and Fifty years after the industrial revolution we are still seeking a better life. We are still facing drastic change and discontent. The long hours of the factories may be over, but the cubicle has taken the its place, along with our time. Like the founders of the Arts and Crafts Movement, I advocate on the behalf of the indigenous peoples of the earth—for all of us. I advocate that their relationship to the natural world be upheld, and in so doing, that they might help all of us find our own relationship with nature and thereby, shift our consciousness to create a new shared dream for our human family.</p>
<p>I trust in the Alliance that is the Pachamama Alliance. I trust that their partnership with the indigenous people of the Amazon Rainforest will help to empower indigenous people of the Amazon rainforest to preserve their lands and culture and, using insights gained from that work, educate and inspire individuals everywhere to bring forth a thriving, just and sustainable world.</p>
<p>Please join me in supporting this project. Our very survival counts on your support.  </p>
<h2>WHAT’S SO RIGHT NOW</h2>
<p>The Achuar have partnered with their northern allies to create The Pachamama Alliance. Their ancestral lands—nearly 5 million acres in all—straddle the modern borders of Ecuador and Peru, a remote area that has allowed them to preserve their way of life with little outside influence or colonization. The Achuar people are taking a stand for the natural world on the behalf of all of us. This is <strong>a call for our time</strong>.</p>
<p>The Achuar’s land may seem like the middle of nowhere, yet it is <strong>the heart of everywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>Rainforests are <strong>essential to our survival</strong>. They are the <strong>Lungs of our Planet</strong>. Rainforests are in service to the planet, continuously recycling carbon dioxide into oxygen.</p>
<p>More than half of the world's estimated <strong>10 million species</strong> of plants, animals and insects live in the tropical rainforests. <strong>One-fifth of the world's fresh water</strong> is in the Amazon Basin. 25 percent of modern pharmaceuticals are derived from rainforest ingredients, yet less than 1 percent of these trees and plants have been tested by scientists. The U.S. National Cancer Institute has identified <strong>3000 plants that are active against cancer cells</strong>. 70 percent of these plants are found in the rainforest. 25 percent of the <em>active ingredients</em> in today's cancer-fighting drugs come from organisms found only in the rainforest.</p>
<p>At least <strong>80 percent of the developed world's diet</strong> originated in the tropical rainforest. Rainforests offer over <strong>3000 varieties of fruits</strong>. Of these, only 200 are now in use in the Western World. By comparison, the Indians of the rainforest use over 2,000 of these fruits.</p>
<h2><strong>THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE</strong></h2>
<p><strong>We are losing Earth's greatest biological treasures and much of this loss is due to human intervention. </strong>Rainforests once covered 14 percent of the earth's land surface, now they cover a mere 6 percent. Half of our ancient forests are gone forever.</p>
<p>Experts estimate that without <strong>systematic change</strong>, the last remaining rainforests will be consumed in less than 40 years. The potential for new <strong>medicines</strong> to cure diseases, <strong>foods</strong> that could end starvation, and <strong>oxygen</strong> for our planet will all be <strong>lost forever</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE</strong></h2>
<p>Technology has connected us—<em>all of us</em>—like never before on earth. We are meeting each other globally, and in this meeting, we have a <strong>clash of worldviews</strong>. The Achuar people are <strong>transforming</strong> this clash of worldviews into a merger so that the technological genius of the modern world proceeds in recognition of the interconnected nature of all things. They are working to protect their ancient way of life and to <strong>preserve the natural world for all of humanity</strong>. We may find the keys to resolving the problems of our immediate future by listening to the voices of our ancient past.</p>
<p>The Pachamama Alliance was born out of an invitation from the Achuar people to work in partnership with them to preserve their land and culture while bringing forth a new worldview that honors and sustains life.</p>
<p>The Achuar people want to <strong>“change the dream of the North”. </strong>They want us to work within our own modern culture, shifting it from wasteful consumerism to a less destructive, more sustainable paradigm.</p>
<p>This film will articulate the Achuar’s vision of transforming how people see and relate to the world and the possibilities they see for our future.</p>

<p>MAKING THE FILM</p>
<p>The film will be created by a team that has worked with the Pachamama Alliance and the Achuar people for many years. The video below is an example of their work. The new film will highlight the urgent nature of the current situation.</p>
<p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/17068946"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/17068946</a></p>
<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>I am not a filmmaker, but the Pachamama Alliance has a professional team that creates their films. As you can see from their website, they do a very nice job. Some of the challenges they face in creating this film include time and travel to the Ecuadorian Amazon for film footage.</p>
<p>Time is of the essence as international oil interests clamber for control of the Achuar’s homeland. All of the filming equipment needs to be flown into remote areas on small planes. This equipment is heavy and the cost of freight on these small planes is great. Filming in the Amazon has the obvious challenges: no electricity, rain, mud, but also the challenge of capturing the essence of the Achuar culture in a way that translates to our culture.</p>
<p>Truth be told, without this funding, this film may never be made. The idea for this film evolved out of my own desire to make a real difference in the world. I hope that you will join me in support. </p>

We are losing Earth's greatest biological treasures and much of this loss is due to human intervention. Rainforests once covered 14 percent of the earth's land surface, now they cover a mere 6 percent. Half of our ancient forests are gone forever.
Experts estimate that without systematic change, the last remaining rainforests will be consumed in less than 40 years. The potential for new medicines to cure diseases, foods that could end starvation, and oxygen for our planet will all be lost forever.
YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
Technology has connected us—all of us—like never before on earth. We are meeting each other globally, and in this meeting, we have a clash of worldviews. The Achuar people are transforming this clash of worldviews into a merger so that the technological genius of the modern world proceeds in recognition of the interconnected nature of all things. They are working to protect their ancient way of life and to preserve the natural world for all of humanity. We may find the keys to resolving the problems of our immediate future by listening to the voices of our ancient past.
The Pachamama Alliance was born out of an invitation from the Achuar people to work in partnership with them to preserve their land and culture while bringing forth a new worldview that honors and sustains life.
The Achuar people want to “change the dream of the North”. They want us to work within our own modern culture, shifting it from wasteful consumerism to a less destructive, more sustainable paradigm.
This film will articulate the Achuar’s vision of transforming how people see and relate to the world and the possibilities they see for our future.

MAKING THE FILM
The film will be created by a team that has worked with the Pachamama Alliance and the Achuar people for many years. The video below is an example of their work. The new film will highlight the urgent nature of the current situation.

Risks and Challenges
I am not a filmmaker, but the Pachamama Alliance has a professional team that creates their films. As you can see from their website, they do a very nice job. Some of the challenges they face in creating this film include time and travel to the Ecuadorian Amazon for film footage.
Time is of the essence as international oil interests clamber for control of the Achuar’s homeland. All of the filming equipment needs to be flown into remote areas on small planes. This equipment is heavy and the cost of freight on these small planes is great. Filming in the Amazon has the obvious challenges: no electricity, rain, mud, but also the challenge of capturing the essence of the Achuar culture in a way that translates to our culture.
Truth be told, without this funding, this film may never be made. The idea for this film evolved out of my own desire to make a real difference in the world. I hope that you will join me in support.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Introducing... our team and our project </h2>
<p>We are a team of twenty university students hailing from Singapore. Despite living in an intensely urban environment, all of us are passionate about helping the environment in some way, whether it is switching off the lights when we leave the room or doggedly using metal over plastic straws. We got together to take this passion one step further, into the wild of Aek Godang, North Sumatra. </p>
<p>Sumatra boasts a distinct and diverse ecology found nowhere else in the world. Like any other ecology, it is fragile and needs to be protected. This is where we - and you - come in. Your help will be invaluable in helping us achieve our goals of planting 20,000 saplings (and more if we can manage) and improving the standard of care afforded to rescued gibbons currently undergoing rehabilitation. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>So you may ask, what about sustainability? </h2>
</div><div>
<p>Aek Godang in Northern Sumatra is a vast area of more than 600 hectares. Our team will help to provide essential manpower and resources such as seeds in the reforestation project. In terms of sustainability, one of the purposes of building improved gibbon enclosures is to leave behind construction blueprints as well as set up infrastructure such as resource supply lines. These blueprints and resource infrastructure will be accessible to local wildlife sanctuaries that might not necessarily have access to appropriate information and resources, allowing this project to be ultimately, locally sustained. </p>
<p>Given the fact that our team will only be able to work on the project in May, monitoring the progress of our efforts beyond our stay is definitely a pertinent issue. Therefore, we will depend on the locals to update us as well as carry out up-keep works, to ensure the saplings successfully develop into trees and the new enclosures built are well-maintained.  On another note, as we send a team of students overseas annually to participate in community involvement projects, we are ourselves a resource that can be tapped into to ensure that this project is more than a one-off. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We Need </h2>
<p>We are hoping to raise at least 1000 dollars. All proceeds will go towards covering project material costs such as the purchase of seeds, digging equipment and cement for the gibbon enclosure. It will also help members to offset transportation costs, as Aek Godang is in a remote and inaccessible location about 10 hours drive away from Kuala Namo International Airport (Medan City) where we will be landing. Our project costs total more than 20,000 dollars, 70% of which is borne by the members themselves. Therefore, we are deeply grateful for any small donation you make. </p>
</div><div><p> </p></div><div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>You can help by donating, or by spreading the word to family and friends - let them know about our project, and how they can help! Every effort we put into raising awareness of, and taking concrete steps to protect the fragile ecosystems that are home to some of the most vulnerable beings on the planet <strong>counts</strong>. We hope you can provide us with the support we need, financial or otherwise, to give back to the planet we call home. </p>

We will raise money for our PAC and donate the money to various water political interest groups that align with our mission statement.  
2013 was one of the driest year recorded in the state of California. Governor Brown declared

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are raising money to improve our local neighborhood (5th and Mission) by replacing damaged trees. Our urban neighborhood has 5 trees that need to be replaced, which would not only make our neighborhood prettier, but provide cleaner air for the pedestrian traffic. We are working with Friends of the Urban Forest (FUF), a non-profit organization based in San Francisco. FUF helps individuals and neighborhood groups plant and care for street trees and sidewalk gardens. This ""green infrastructure"" improves the city by beautifying neighborhoods, cleaning the air, raising property values and reducing polluted storm-water runoff. Since 1981, FUF has planted more than 49,000 trees, totaling 47% of the city's street tree canopy.

What We Need & What You Get
 
We only need $1,000 in monies! This will replace 5 trees.
We have a stretch goal of an additional $1,000 to help San Francisco School District purchase trees for school yards.
If we do not reach our goal, all funds will go directly to FUF to be applied to low-income neighborhoods that require trees or tree care services.


Perks!!


$5 Facebook shout-out
$15 FUF Pin
$30 (for individuals) Facebook shout-out from FUF and Pin 
$50 FUF Shirt
$100 (for business/group) Facebook shout-out from FUF

The Impact
 
Typically, to sign up for a tree or replacement tree services through FUF, neighbors come together and complete a tree plant request form. Once a neighborhood has at least 30 trees requested, a tree planting date is scheduled. Plantings are community events that include neighborhood residents, volunteers and FUF staff. Most of FUF's tree planting costs are covered by grants and donations; only a small copayment is made by property owners. Since the 5th and Mission is an urban, lower-income, and commercial neighborhood, there are challenges to get property owners to come together. As many of us call this neighborhood work or it's part of our commute, it's up to us to change the appearance, improve the quality of air and build a green community. 



Trees produce oxygen, clean the air and reduce global warming




Trees release oxygen as a product of photosynthesis.  Two medium-sized, healthy trees can supply the oxygen required for a single person for a year. 
Trees clean the air by absorbing greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming; they store carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, in their stems and leaves. 
Trees capture airborne particles such as dirt, dust and soot; a mature tree can absorb 120-240 lbs of particulate pollution each year.

 A 2008 study by researchers at Columbia University found that more trees in urban neighborhoods correlate with a lower incidence of asthma.


And more benefits… 
                                                                                               



 Street trees and sidewalk gardens create a physical and mental barrier between the street and the sidewalk, keeping pedestrians, children and pets out of harm’s way.

Street trees and sidewalk gardens provide a natural habitat for birds and insects.
Street trees absorb traffic noise and increase privacy.
Street trees and sidewalk gardens build neighborhood and civic pride.
Neighborhood planting events strengthen communities and bring neighbors together.

Benefits of working with Friends of the Urban Forest

Thanks to more than three decades of experience, FUF are the experts in the selection, planting and care of street trees and sidewalk gardens in every neighborhood in San Francisco.
They work with property owners to ensure they get the trees and sidewalk gardens most suitable for them.
They manage every step in the process, from site inspection to species selection to planting and follow-up care.
Their group planting events bring neighbors together to transform their block.

I started out trying to invent a better, more useful wind turbine--for building tops, and I believe I have succeeded.  But as it has turned out so far, that was the easy part.  The hard part is showing people what I came up with.  ""Seeing is believing"" seems to be key, so a valid working prototype also seems to be crucial in the process--or at least a very good animation.  In what I'm attempting to do here, I promise I'll try my best to make this ""real"" to you in such a way as to build trust, as my goal is to help people and Earth with my new wind turbine technology, not to take advantage of anyone.
If you can't donate money, perhaps you'll consider helping with your time by telling others about this effort.  Any help at all will be greatly appreciated...even your prayers!  And don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools as I strive to develop social media connections.  I set up a special website to showcase my new invention and talk about it, and I can be reached by email through the site if anyone has any questions or any good ideas to help me in this Indiegogo crowdsourcing effort.

And that’s it, as we hope for a better environmental future.  Thanks for your vision and for your contributions!

I have been living in Canada for the past 12 years, however, my heart has never left Romania. Two years ago I got involved in the 'Save Rosia Montana' campaign. What is this all about? Rosia Montana is a beautiful historical place in the mountains of Transilvania where Gabriel Resurces of Canada wants to open the largest open pit gold mine in Europe. Environmentalist and activists have been fighting this project for over 13 years; the project is destructive for the following reasons:</p>
<p>-Over 13.000 tons of cyanide would be used each year to leach the gold.</p>
<p>-Four mountains will be cut open and thus destroyed.</p>
<p>-Rosia Montana is the oldest documented settlement in Romania, containing important historical vestiges from the Roman Empire time. Everything will be lost.</p>
<p>-The Romanian state will make 6% of the profit from the gold and silver and 0% of the profit from the precious metals, which some experts say could have more value than the gold. </p>
<p>- The Romanian state will be responsible with maintaining the huge dam containing cyanide and other chemical residues that would be released from the exploration, forever.

The president is now proposing a change in the constitution that would allow foreign companies to expropriate private property to serve their needs.

<h2 class=""p1""><strong>About Me </strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">I am a renewable energy engineer with a background in renewable energy, systems engineering, sustainable development, and IT systems analysis and administration. <strong>I am currently providing my services at no charge/volunteering to the Wysinger Family</strong> in Berkeley, CA, USA who requires assistance decommissioning this freewheeling [non-electricity generating] Aero Power SL 1500 small wind turbine. This wind turbine was installed on their property back in December 1981, and commissioned in January 1982.</p>
<h2 class=""p3""><strong>About the Project</strong></h2>
<p class=""p3""><span style=""color: #ed1555;"">NB: 5/9/13 - The campaign's aim now is to raise at least $600 to tie down the rotor/blades as a temporary fix.</span></p>
<p class=""p3"">Generating energy closer to where it will be used just makes sense. However, when a small wind turbine is poorly sited, the results can be worthless – and worse. It can become a safety hazard for the community. But decommissioning such a turbine would be a valuable lesson for future residential wind power, when aging wind turbines will have to be decommissioned, and provide valuable information in developing future residential wind turbines. <span style=""color: #ed1555;""><strong>Want to be a part of wind power history?</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p3"">Case in point, the Aero Power SL1500 that was installed in December 1981 and commissioned January 1982 at 3228 Idaho Street in Berkeley, CA. Check out the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP0AC_cvQ8c&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Urban Wind Turbine Installation in Berkeley, CA, USA 1981"">digitized 8mm video</a> of the installation, and <a href=""http://www.kimgerly.com/projects/25Mar82_BerkeleyGazetteArticle.PDF"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s1"">click here</span></a> to read the 25 March 1982<em> Berkeley Gazette </em>article about this installation. </p>
<p class=""p5""><span style=""color: #ed1555;""><strong>NB: There is no sound to the video. </strong></span><br/><br/><strong>You can fast-forward the 12:15 YouTube video to these time stamps of interest:</strong></p>
<p class=""p5"">2:05 Base of tower/mast installed<br/> 3:30 Second section of the tower/mast installed<br/> 3:55 Third section of the tower/mast installed<br/> 5:15 Fourth section of the tower/mast installed<br/> 5:50 Wind turbine generator and tail hoisted to top of tower/mast<br/> 8:20 Shot of VERY DATED Phasor/Inverter<br/> 9:00 Wind turbine rotor blades hoisted and attached to generator and tail sections<br/> 10:04 Aero Power SL 1500 wind turbine spinning</p>
<p class=""p5"">Sadly, in just a couple of months the family realized the wind turbine would not generate the amount of electricity the developer had promised. So they decided to decommission it. However, they just did not have the financial means to do that -- especially after the $12,000 they’d dropped on the installation.</p>
<h3 class=""p5""><strong>Fast forward to 2005…</strong></h3>
<p class=""p5"">One day early in 2005, I happened to turned down Idaho Street on my bike, and discovered the wind turbine. I was inspired to see this machine in a densely populated, major metropolitan area – so inspired, in fact, that I returned to grad school to study small wind turbines in the built/urban environment. What I mostly learned there was how NOT to install a small wind turbine in the built/urban environment and composed a presentation you can read, <a href=""http://www.kimgerly.com/projects/WysingerWTDecomProject_WhatNotToDo.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Installing a Small WTG in the Built Environment - WhatNotToDo.pdf""><em>Installing a Small WTG in the Built Environment - What not to do... </em></a></p>
<p class=""p5"">NB: This <a href=""http://www.kimgerly.com/projects/WysingerWTDecomProject_WhatNotToDo.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Installing a Small WTG in the Built Environment - WhatNotToDo.pdf"">presentation</a> includes information about the specifications about the wind turbine and its performance.<em> <br/></em></p>
<h3 class=""p5""><strong>Fast forward to 2012…</strong></h3>
<p class=""p5"">Upon my return to the Bay Area, I asked the Wysinger family about the history of their wind turbine. I learned that it had well exceeded a typical life expectancy of 20 years without a catastrophic failure. The blades on the rotor and other parts of the generator have not sheared off as projectiles -- yet. This is a testimony to the turbine’s robust design by Mario Agnello. </p>
<h2 class=""p5""><strong>Why we need to do this</strong></h2>
<p class=""p5"">What is particularly unfortunate about this wind turbine is that<span style=""color: #ed1555;""><strong> it's been freewheeling (spinning without generating electricity) for over ten years, because someone accidentally severed the brake cable, <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">nor was this wind machine the recipient of any maintenance over all this time</span></strong></strong></span> -- making this machine derelict and dangerous. Several small wind energy experts have told me that this turbine needs to come down post-haste before there is loss of life or property.</p>
<p class=""p5"">Decommissioning the turbine will be historic. Decommissioning a wind turbine in an urban environment is not an everyday occurrence.<strong> The Wysingers wind turbine is one of a few decommissioned in the urban environment in the USA. </strong>And to the best of my knowledge, the only one (?) in the SF Bay Area, but to the best of my knowledge, the first one in Berkeley.</p>
<h3 class=""p5""><strong>Why we need your help and how we’ll use your contributions</strong></h3>
<p class=""p5"">I plan on bringing this story full circle. I will invite the local Channel 5 news team who was on site back in 1981 to return and follow up on the situation, bringing attention to the issue and helping raise funds. That’s important because <strong>if we don’t reach our full funding goal it will be difficult to bring this project to completion, and everyone will be sad -- and people and/or property could get hurt/damaged.</strong></p>
<p class=""p5"">Your contributions will cover the costs of permits, fees, and experts. This will help the Wysinger family, since they don’t have the funds to cover these costs.</p>
<p class=""p5"">And the project will help others, too. What we learn in this decommissioning will benefit other communities who may need to do this in the future. I also hope the report I am in the process of writing will be the beginning of an exacting standard for the small wind turbine industry. The costs of number of permits, fees and experts need to be covered, and the Wysinger family lacks the financial means to do fund this endeavor. <strong><span style=""color: #ed1555;"">That's where I require your assistance…</span></strong></p>
<h3 class=""p7"">
<strong>Risks and Challenges</strong> </h3>
<p class=""p7"">This is unknown or new territory for everyone involved: me, the Wysinger Family, the City of Berkeley, my wind energy experts and other contractors who will be on the job. But I will take every precaution to mitigate risks. </p>
<p class=""p7"">Safety is my biggest concern. Only when the asbestos abatement survey is completed can we get permits for the demolition and encroachment from the City of Berkeley. After that, we can begin the actual decommissioning. </p>
<p class=""p7"">Small wind energy expert Ian Woofenden, along with California Licensed C10 Electricians and demolition experts, have offered to help me. We’ll work together to get the turbine down safely from atop the 60-foot pole, so no one is hurt and no property is damaged.</p>

</ul><h2 class=""p13""><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<p class=""p18""><span style=""color: #ed1555;""><strong>Why does it cost so much to decommission this wind turbine?</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p18"">Yes, it surprisingly costs a great deal to decommission this small wind turbine. This is due to the fact that it was installed in a location that would not be allowable by today's standards. It is in very close proximity to electrical power lines and housing structures, making this decommissioning very chanllenging. A breakdown of the costs follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""p18"">Planning [includes an asbestos survey and report, miscellaneous City of Berkeley paperwork, wind expert consultations] - $2,262.00</li>
<li class=""p18"">Wind turbine expert - $3,300.00</li>
<li class=""p18"">PG&amp;E [budget for Utility Clearance an to de-energize circuits--this is an estimate; it could end up being $3,000 more!] - $5,000.00</li>
<li class=""p18"">City of Berkeley permits [electrical, demolition, zoning, encroachment] - $3,045.00</li>
<li class=""p18"">Crane [includes the crane rental, operator, rigger] - $2,800.00</li>
<li class=""p18"">Incidentals - $2,500.00</li>
<li class=""p18"">Electrician - $1,500.00</li>
<li class=""p18"">Tree climber [to assist the wind turbine expert] - $250.00</li>
<li class=""p18"">Hauling [for mast to the recycler] - $160.00</li>
</ul><p class=""p18""><strong>TOTAL: $20,817.00</strong></p>
<p class=""p13""><span style=""color: #ed1555;""><strong>How does the cost of this decommissioning compare to the cost of other wind turbines decommissioned?</strong> </span></p>
<p>Yes, $20,000+ is a great deal of money for a single, residential wind turbine. However, this is several times less to the costs for decommissioning utility scale wind turbines. This citation is from an April 2011 article – <a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/print-edition/2011/04/29/unused-wind-farm-raises.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Unused wind farm raises decommissioning issues"">Unused wind farm raises decommissioning issues</a></p>
<p>[snip]<br/> …the costs for removing the turbines have been prohibitively high,…</p>
<p>…costs would approach $1 million, and while the parts could be sold for scrap metal he said that would net only about $300,000…</p>
<p>…the estimated cost of taking down a present-day turbine, when that time comes, will be $100,000 in today’s dollars…</p>
<p class=""p13""><span style=""color: #ed1555;""><strong>Where can I find out more about the wind turbine's technical specifications?</strong> </span><br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is no formal, historical print documentation available for this machine. Information about this wind turbine's technical specifications can be located in the <a href=""http://www.kimgerly.com/projects/WysingerWTDecomProject_WhatNotToDo.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Installing a Small WTG in the Built Environment - WhatNotToDo.pdf""><em>Installing a Small WTG in the Built Environment - What not to do...</em></a> presentation.</p>
<p class=""p13""><span style=""color: #ed1555;""><strong>Why did the family want to decommission the turbine when it was still generating power, even though they weren’t getting as much power as promised? </strong></span></p>
<p class=""p14"">Based on their PG&amp;E bill, the family realized after a short period of time, this machine was not going to come close in affording them the promised payback by the developer within the predicted timeframe.</p>

The City of Berkeley is FINALLY stepping in to offer the home owner guidance on this decommissioning... 
About Me 
I am a renewable energy engineer with a background in renewable energy, systems engineering, sustainable development, and IT systems analysis and administration. I am currently providing my services at no charge/volunteering to the Wysinger Family in Berkeley, CA, USA who requires assistance decommissioning this freewheeling [non-electricity generating] Aero Power SL 1500 small wind turbine. This wind turbine was installed on their property back in December 1981, and commissioned in January 1982.
About the Project
NB: 5/9/13 - The campaign's aim now is to raise at least $600 to tie down the rotor/blades as a temporary fix.
Generating energy closer to where it will be used just makes sense. However, when a small wind turbine is poorly sited, the results can be worthless – and worse. It can become a safety hazard for the community. But decommissioning such a turbine would be a valuable lesson for future residential wind power, when aging wind turbines will have to be decommissioned, and provide valuable information in developing future residential wind turbines. Want to be a part of wind power history?
Case in point, the Aero Power SL1500 that was installed in December 1981 and commissioned January 1982 at 3228 Idaho Street in Berkeley, CA. Check out the digitized 8mm video of the installation, and click here to read the 25 March 1982 Berkeley Gazette article about this installation. 
NB: There is no sound to the video. You can fast-forward the 12:15 YouTube video to these time stamps of interest:
2:05 Base of tower/mast installed 3:30 Second section of the tower/mast installed 3:55 Third section of the tower/mast installed 5:15 Fourth section of the tower/mast installed 5:50 Wind turbine generator and tail hoisted to top of tower/mast 8:20 Shot of VERY DATED Phasor/Inverter 9:00 Wind turbine rotor blades hoisted and attached to generator and tail sections 10:04 Aero Power SL 1500 wind turbine spinning
Sadly, in just a couple of months the family realized the wind turbine would not generate the amount of electricity the developer had promised. So they decided to decommission it. However, they just did not have the financial means to do that -- especially after the $12,000 they’d dropped on the installation.
Fast forward to 2005…
One day early in 2005, I happened to turned down Idaho Street on my bike, and discovered the wind turbine. I was inspired to see this machine in a densely populated, major metropolitan area – so inspired, in fact, that I returned to grad school to study small wind turbines in the built/urban environment. What I mostly learned there was how NOT to install a small wind turbine in the built/urban environment and composed a presentation you can read, Installing a Small WTG in the Built Environment - What not to do... 
NB: This presentation includes information about the specifications about the wind turbine and its performance. 
Fast forward to 2012…
Upon my return to the Bay Area, I asked the Wysinger family about the history of their wind turbine. I learned that it had well exceeded a typical life expectancy of 20 years without a catastrophic failure. The blades on the rotor and other parts of the generator have not sheared off as projectiles -- yet. This is a testimony to the turbine’s robust design by Mario Agnello. 
Why we need to do this
What is particularly unfortunate about this wind turbine is that it's been freewheeling (spinning without generating electricity) for over ten years, because someone accidentally severed the brake cable, nor was this wind machine the recipient of any maintenance over all this time -- making this machine derelict and dangerous. Several small wind energy experts have told me that this turbine needs to come down post-haste before there is loss of life or property.
Decommissioning the turbine will be historic. Decommissioning a wind turbine in an urban environment is not an everyday occurrence. The Wysingers wind turbine is one of a few decommissioned in the urban environment in the USA. And to the best of my knowledge, the only one (?) in the SF Bay Area, but to the best of my knowledge, the first one in Berkeley.
Why we need your help and how we’ll use your contributions
I plan on bringing this story full circle. I will invite the local Channel 5 news team who was on site back in 1981 to return and follow up on the situation, bringing attention to the issue and helping raise funds. That’s important because if we don’t reach our full funding goal it will be difficult to bring this project to completion, and everyone will be sad -- and people and/or property could get hurt/damaged.
Your contributions will cover the costs of permits, fees, and experts. This will help the Wysinger family, since they don’t have the funds to cover these costs.
And the project will help others, too. What we learn in this decommissioning will benefit other communities who may need to do this in the future. I also hope the report I am in the process of writing will be the beginning of an exacting standard for the small wind turbine industry. The costs of number of permits, fees and experts need to be covered, and the Wysinger family lacks the financial means to do fund this endeavor. That's where I require your assistance…

Risks and Challenges 
This is unknown or new territory for everyone involved: me, the Wysinger Family, the City of Berkeley, my wind energy experts and other contractors who will be on the job. But I will take every precaution to mitigate risks. 
Safety is my biggest concern. Only when the asbestos abatement survey is completed can we get permits for the demolition and encroachment from the City of Berkeley. After that, we can begin the actual decommissioning. 
Small wind energy expert Ian Woofenden, along with California Licensed C10 Electricians and demolition experts, have offered to help me. We’ll work together to get the turbine down safely from atop the 60-foot pole, so no one is hurt and no property is damaged.
Other Ways You Can Help
I understand it's a difficult time financially for a lot of folks--but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:

You can help us get the word out by sharing information about this project on social media networks like Twitter, Reddit or Facebook.

FAQ
Why does it cost so much to decommission this wind turbine?
Yes, it surprisingly costs a great deal to decommission this small wind turbine. This is due to the fact that it was installed in a location that would not be allowable by today's standards. It is in very close proximity to electrical power lines and housing structures, making this decommissioning very chanllenging. A breakdown of the costs follows:

Planning [includes an asbestos survey and report, miscellaneous City of Berkeley paperwork, wind expert consultations] - $2,262.00
Wind turbine expert - $3,300.00
PG&E [budget for Utility Clearance an to de-energize circuits--this is an estimate; it could end up being $3,000 more!] - $5,000.00
City of Berkeley permits [electrical, demolition, zoning, encroachment] - $3,045.00
Crane [includes the crane rental, operator, rigger] - $2,800.00
Incidentals - $2,500.00
Electrician - $1,500.00
Tree climber [to assist the wind turbine expert] - $250.00
Hauling [for mast to the recycler] - $160.00
TOTAL: $20,817.00
How does the cost of this decommissioning compare to the cost of other wind turbines decommissioned? 
Yes, $20,000+ is a great deal of money for a single, residential wind turbine. However, this is several times less to the costs for decommissioning utility scale wind turbines. This citation is from an April 2011 article – Unused wind farm raises decommissioning issues
[snip] …the costs for removing the turbines have been prohibitively high,…
…costs would approach $1 million, and while the parts could be sold for scrap metal he said that would net only about $300,000…
…the estimated cost of taking down a present-day turbine, when that time comes, will be $100,000 in today’s dollars…
Where can I find out more about the wind turbine's technical specifications? Unfortunately, there is no formal, historical print documentation available for this machine. Information about this wind turbine's technical specifications can be located in the Installing a Small WTG in the Built Environment - What not to do... presentation.
Why did the family want to decommission the turbine when it was still generating power, even though they weren’t getting as much power as promised? 
Based on their PG&E bill, the family realized after a short period of time, this machine was not going to come close in affording them the promised payback by the developer within the predicted timeframe.
If the turbine has been freewheeling for so long with no damage, why is it urgent to take it down now? 
At 30 years and 5 months, this wind turbine has never received any maintenance, and far exceeded its life expectancy of 20 years. Like the moving parts in an automobile, machines eventually fail, fall apart, break. Most utility scale wind turbines are subject to a preventative maintenance check of '40 hours per year.'    Parts of this machine and it's tower/mast/pole could shear off/'shed-off' projectiles and land on a person(s) or adjacent property.

<p>Hello, I am Fabien Cousteau. The name should ring a bell - I am Jacques Cousteau's grandson. Like my oceanographer grandfather, I have a love of the deep sea and a desire to explore - for science, education, our collective future and health.</p>
<p><font size=""2""><span style="""">Therefore, in the spring 2014 I will undertake a ground breaking project, called Mission 31. My team of scientists, ocean explorers and filmmakers will embark on a 31-day mission in Aquarius, the only underwater marine habitat and lab in the world located 63 feet beneath the sea off the coast of the Florida Keys.</span></font></p>
<p><span style="""">Our team will test new technologies; conduct research on the effects of climate change on corals, sponges and sea life, map the seafloor, and study the physiological and psychological impacts of long-term submerging such as living in a high-pressure environment as well as living without sun exposure for prolonged periods. </span><br/></p>
<p>Using the latest camera technology, we will be able to show the world every moment of Mission 31 in unedited, real-time!  Thousands of school children will be able to chat with the aquanauts as they share in what they are seeing and studying, instilling a sense of love and wonder for the marine environment.  <br/></p>
<p>We have explored less than five percent of our ocean realms - there's so much more to be discovered.</p>
<p>Professors of Marine Science from Northeastern University's Urban Coastal Sustainability Initiative and the University of Delaware CSHEL Laboratory make up the science advisory team for Mission 31, providing us with sophisticated instrumentation, including underwater robots, sensor arrays, and imaging devices.<br/></p>
<h2><strong>Why Support Mission 31?<br/></strong></h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Because we want you to take part in this groundbreaking, sea-loving project. And because we hope that you too believe in our mission...<strong><br/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To provide children and young adults with both a chance to dream and to experience the excitement of discovery, exploration and scientific endeavors.</li>
<li>To conduct meaningful and important scientific experiments that can be run most effectively when truly saturated under the sea for 31 days.</li>
<li>To push the limits of human potential when living in inhospitable conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Mission 31 is a very expensive endeavor. We have some financial sponsors, but need more money, and we want it coming from the crowd.  We're trying to make every aspect of Mission 31 accessible to all.</p>

Hello, I am Fabien Cousteau. The name should ring a bell - I am Jacques Cousteau's grandson. Like my oceanographer grandfather, I have a love of the deep sea and a desire to explore - for science, education, our collective future and health.
Therefore, in the spring 2014 I will undertake a ground breaking project, called Mission 31. My team of scientists, ocean explorers and filmmakers will embark on a 31-day mission in Aquarius, the only underwater marine habitat and lab in the world located 63 feet beneath the sea off the coast of the Florida Keys.
Our team will test new technologies; conduct research on the effects of climate change on corals, sponges and sea life, map the seafloor, and study the physiological and psychological impacts of long-term submerging such as living in a high-pressure environment as well as living without sun exposure for prolonged periods. 
Using the latest camera technology, we will be able to show the world every moment of Mission 31 in unedited, real-time!  Thousands of school children will be able to chat with the aquanauts as they share in what they are seeing and studying, instilling a sense of love and wonder for the marine environment.  
We have explored less than five percent of our ocean realms - there's so much more to be discovered.
Professors of Marine Science from Northeastern University's Urban Coastal Sustainability Initiative and the University of Delaware CSHEL Laboratory make up the science advisory team for Mission 31, providing us with sophisticated instrumentation, including underwater robots, sensor arrays, and imaging devices.
Why Support Mission 31?
Because we want you to take part in this groundbreaking, sea-loving project. And because we hope that you too believe in our mission...

To provide children and young adults with both a chance to dream and to experience the excitement of discovery, exploration and scientific endeavors.
To conduct meaningful and important scientific experiments that can be run most effectively when truly saturated under the sea for 31 days.
To push the limits of human potential when living in inhospitable conditions.

Mission 31 is a very expensive endeavor. We have some financial sponsors, but need more money, and we want it coming from the crowd.  We're trying to make every aspect of Mission 31 accessible to all.
Our Partners:

<p>I am Sammy Muraya, the chairman of Vijanaa Youth Group. I currently work with a team of 16 registered members where with whom we are running an environmental project. Why environment? We chose to carry out environmental projects simply because environment habors anything needed for life. It’s through the interaction of living and non-living things that life exists. Just imagine an environment without air which is non living. How would humans and animals survive? And how would plants grow? It is against this background that we choose to collect garbage. Garbage which make breeding nests for vectors causing diseases to humans and animals. Garbage which slowly decomposes thus releasing greenhouse gases hence causing global warming among other things.</p>
<p>Since my city harbors slums which are not only the largest polluters in the city but also the biggest victims of diseases arising from poor waste handling, we want to restore the lost glory (aesthetic value) of our city and save lives at the same time. We definitely need your hand in this.</p>
<p><strong>What we need </strong></p>
<p>We have estimated the whole project to cost like $ 5000. This money will cater for the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gloves</li>
<li>Gas masks</li>
<li>Hire of tools such as Rakes, spades, wheelbarrows,</li>
<li>Gumboots</li>
<li>Overalls  </li>
<li>Hire of a track to ferry the wastes to designated dumping sites</li>
<li>Processing of brochures and posters</li>
<li>Preparation of certificates of participation</li>
<li> Lunch for the participants etc</li>
</ul>
<p>What will you get in return for your contribution? A big thank you in our native language; Swahili. Just in case we do not meet our $5000 target, we shall use the little amount that we shall manage to get.</p>
<p><strong>The impact</strong></p>
<p>Through the program, we are aiming at collecting the garbage and educating the local communities on the importance of living in a clean environment. It has been the desire of everyone in the world to live in an environment that is free from Malaria, cholera, diarrhea which are mainly as a result of living in a dirty environment. By carrying out this project to completion, we believe we shall have helped the global village; the world to move towards attaining its goal.</p>
<p><strong>Other ways to help</strong></p>
<p>Not everyone can be in a position to help financially. But is that a reason enough to mean that you can’t contribute? NO! of course you can contribute in many other ways. You can help spread the word to others and that way, you will have played your role. You can use the Indiegogo share tools to reach out others who can help. Thank you very much as you purpose to partner with us. Thanks!</p>

</div></div>","Hello everyone.


I have a simple proposition for you...  help me make rent and I will volunteer to make a difference in Hawaii. 


Here's how it works:  You (so kindly) donate to my rent jar and for every $20 received I will donate one hour of my time to various organizations around Hawaii that help the community and the environment.  My rent is $800 including utilities (the cheapest I could find with a 12 y/o dog).  By successfully helping me accomplish this goal, I will give a total of 40 hours to Hawaii's people and plants.  Every weekend I will volunteer at least 4 hours, which amounts to 10 fabulous weeks of volunteering.  When you donate, you can choose which category of volunteering is your favorite... and I'll do it!      



Here's why it needs to work:  Studying botany in Hawaii is one of the best opportunities I could have asked for.  Yet, it is one of the most expensive places I could have chosen.  I work two on-campus jobs (research assistant in plant pathology and editorial assistant for JNRPR) and receive financial aid...but I work the maximum hours allowed and am unable to receive additional aid.  This semester I have class/work/independent research from 9-6 Monday-Friday, therefore, I either need to find a weekend job that pays $30/hour or I need to volunteer my time for Hawaii!  The second option seems like the best/only option. This is my last year of school and I need to graduate...I am running out of money, and need your help!      



See the Change You Wish to Be in the World  
I know you would love to volunteer in Hawaii if you could, but I will be your hands and heart!  Every Sunday evening I will add stories and photos my new blog, http://meagankaymarie.wordpress.com,  for all to see updates of the volunteer work accomplished that weekend, who was impacted, and the change you (we) have made in the community.  I will also post a shortened version to the updates section of this site.  It will be a spectacular show!


You might notice the organizations I will be volunteering with all have a common theme...plants.  That's because I study plants and feel passionate about making a difference in the world through them.  This can mean conservation of native species, restoration of native land use systems, teaching children nutrition and environmental stewardship through gardening, preserving herbarium specimens, promoting sustainable agriculture, maintaining ethnobotanical gardens, preventing invasive species, or increasing seed conservation. 
 
Together We Can Make a Difference!!

Oasis Armada is sailing for a better world. We are supporting many diverse causes, from the environmental, social, political and economic realms. We aim to sail from the Baltic Sea in Scandinavia, out of the fjord where the village of Ytterjärna lies, and head south. Along the way we will be visiting and working with many people, projects and places, sharing our skills and telling their stories.
Currently we are preparing for departure at our base in Ytterjärna, with a team of 6 sailors in the making. We have all been living and learning here together for the past 10 months at The International Youth Initiative Program (YIP). We've recently finished our studies and are now ready to get back out into the world, and onto it's oceans!
We believe that life is about the journey, rather than the destination. Therefore, while we have many ideas, resources and a large network of people and projects to visit, we are still joining the dots together, and will continue to do so along the way, hopefully with your help! (See below for more details).
We have many jobs to do, as well as many things to buy, repair and service before we leave, so both time and our bank balance are against us. We certainly have a busy month ahead in order to make our departure date, but are motivated and determined to be ready to go! We are deeply grateful for your support in helping us achieve our goal of DEPARTURE ON: SEPTEMBER 1st 2012!!!
Where are we sailing towards?
Oasis Armada envisions a world where all things on earth co-exist in harmony - where we as humans have sustainable relationships with our environment, and with each other. We are aligned with the permaculture principles of Earth Care, People Care, and Fair Share. Finally we see that we can act as a catalyst towards reaching this vision by practicing what we preach, and by sharing our experiences and skills in order to awaken, inspire and empower others.
Our Finances
As we sail, we will be relying on gift economy. That is, we will be asking for those that believe in the work we are doing, to help support our minimal financial needs via our website. We will also be offering our services to individuals, businesses and organizations along the way, in exchange for a gift which they feel represents the value of what we have provided to them.

Voyage Details
Departure
As stated above, we plan to leave from Ytterjärna, Sweden, on the 1st September 2012, and sail south through the Baltic Sea, continuing south around the European Continent.
Route
Our first port of call will be Gotland, where we will be supporting the Ojnareskogan campaign to stop Nordkalk from building a limestone quarry in a unique area for biodiversity in Europe. The campagns aim is to secure the fresh water reserve and natural habitat for endangered species.
 Our exact course will be a constant work in progress, as we hear about people, places and organisations along the way. However, our progress will be constantly updated on our website, which will include a graphic so you can see where we are in real time, on a map.
Our Ship
We are sailing on a swedish built and registered 27′ Albin Vega, built in 1970.
The Crew
Who are we and what are we doing?
As a team we have been swimming, sailing and training together on and off for the last few months. We have also been working individually on different areas and projects. Below is a short introduction to our crew. Please view their personal profiles and our website to learn more about their personal motivations for joining the voyage.
Onja ~ From Germany, Onja is the boat Owner & Captain. Onja has been spending all his spare time working on his boat, repairing it and building new features.With his accurate and able touch, we  are in great hands.
Thomas ~ From New Zealand, Thomas is our most experienced sailor. Thomas crossed the Atlantic in January 2006 on Zeferin, a beautiful, home-designed and made 42′ sloop from New Zealand. He will also be helping with practical tasks to get the boat ready.
Noemi ~ Noemie, an American and Israeli citizen. Noemi and Thomas spent their first two weeks of free time after YIP working for Stuart Pledger, CEO at Sustainable Leadership Laboratory, developing prototypes for eco-village income sources. For this work, they were able to provide US$1000 worth of much needed equipment for the voyage.
AJ ~ A citizen of the world, AJ cycled with the project P.E.D.A.L. from London to Istanbul in 2011. He is currently networking with local sailors, sailing when possible, and working on a biodynamic farm in the area. AJ will also be making short films to document the voyage, as well as maintaining our website.

I have an upcoming science project, which needs support!  I have chosen to test sushi in order to find out whether what the menu says we are eating is accurate or not. I was shocked to discover that whales and many other endangered fish species are being used as meat in our own sushi! This fact motivated me to investigate local restaurants in my area and find out the truth about what we are eating.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For this project I would like to raise $1,200. I will use most of the money for the DNA testing of the fish, I will use another good amount for supplies and shipping, and lastly, I will use the rest to buy the sushi. Through extensive research I have carefully selected the lab where the fish will be tested, the type of fish I am going test, and the local restaurants through which I will receive the fish. The goal of my project is to bring awareness to my local community about how one meal of sushi is affecting the earth and whether or not they are eating what they think they are eating! Ultimately, I hope to minimize the use of endangered fish for consumption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate any small contribution towards my project, and if you can’t donate you can still help! Spread the word about my project and have friends or family check it out!</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your support.</p>
<p>Passionately,</p>
