<p><b>Bianca Miller London</b> offers a diverse range of nude hosiery designed to
complement women of all complexions.</p>
<p>My passion for nude hosiery stems from my own personal
experience aged 18 and being a December baby it was cold, so I wanted a pair
of nude tights to match my ensemble. I trawled the high street, searched the
internet and saw a variety of options none of which resembled my skin. So what
did I do? Well trying to be young and fashionable – I braved the cold!!</p>
<p>
A few years later, whilst working in the City of London, the challenge
of nude hosiery became poignant again. The job required me to attend corporate
events in professional dress and despite having a larger budget it still proved
impossible to purchase nude hosiery to compliment my skin tone. It was at this
stage I was inspired to start the <u><span>'The Be Group'</span></u>, offering personal
branding and image consultancy services. Whilst styling my clients and delivering workshops on image I saw women of all skin tones and varying budgets were also struggling!</p>

<div>-To cover the costs for the photographer, the costs would be 250 GBP.</div>
<div>- Once the website is done and all branding is in place, we need to pay a distributor and PR agency to put the caps into Shops, which is a total of an initial 2000 GBP for the first 3 months.</div>

<b>Why am I asking for your support?</b><br/>
Though I think every creator deserves support in their journey, there is a
specific reason why I have set up this campaign. <br/>
I have struggled with varying degrees of illness all my life, some I have
battled and conquered and some still firmly have their hold on me and often
make running my business (or functioning at all) very difficult (and on some
days, impossible). <br/>
When I started VV it was without any funding and with very little money as I
was (and am) physically unable to get a 'standard' job, I kept building VV with
the money I was making but without any additional funding, it was very
difficult to expand the brand any further. <br/>
Since then, while trying to find a balance between keeping myself well and
building my business, every penny had been going straight back into my business
(for supplies) and to making sure I'm well enough to continue it (and mostly to
the latter, which as a workaholic, I find very frustrating :) ).<br/>
Working from home gives me pretty flexible hours and allows me to work hard
when I'm feeling good and to have some much needed rest when my body is
fighting me, something I would not be able to get in a 'normal' job.
VelvetVolcano also gives me great joy and a feeling of control which I often
feel desperately out of when my illnesses are flaring. <br/>
But as described in the video above, running a business with little to no
funding behind it makes it very difficult to progress… and there are still so
many sparkly things in VelvetVolcano’s future. <br/>

My name is Tamsyn and I created VelvetVolcano in November 2009 and solely run
it to this day :).

Our small team of engineers and designers  -includes the co-founder of ZAP bikes, the previous project head of the Corbin Sparrow, the designer of the world’s first folding electric scooter, and many other e-bike and electric power industry contributions -- both as designers, environmentalists, publishers and CEO's.

<p><b>ME n' E</b>, unlike some other products, is not intended to make your bike into an e-bike -- but to create a fusion of your pedaling effort with clean electric power.  The added electric power flattens the feel of hills, enhances your ride, and reduces your sweat -- all while putting a big smile on your face.
</p>
<p>
<b>ME n' E</b> uses friction contact with the tire, like several other low-weight drives. The motor drive roller presses into the tire to transmit power and is activated by your initial pedal cadence. When the motor senses that you have begun pedaling, the system begins simulating the power you are providing and the power increases, as you increase your effort. If you cease to maintain the same pace or effort, the system reduces power to match what your are providing.
</p>
<p>
You cannot trick the system to provide power if you do not provide your own. The experience is the most natural and exhilarating you may ever have on a bike. Human effort and electric power just simply go well together.
</p>
<p>
This is not a simple cadence throttle, as <b>ME n' E's</b> software knows when your effort is greater -- even if your legs are not moving quickly.
</p>
<p>
The system will also let you know when it is time to shift gears, as it pauses when you have reached the maximum rpm for the gear ratio.  The momentary pause signals that it’s time to shift.
</p>
<p>
<b>ME n' E</b> does its magic by adding power whenever you add power, but without using sensors and wires.  It knows when you need help by using a proprietary algorithm.  It takes no tools or skills to install or remove in 2 minutes or less.
</p>
<p>
We wanted to make the system feel like normal cycling, allowing normal exercise, while having only a 2-lb (.9kg). weight penalty (batteries included), making time on your bike  feel even better than you might expect.
</p>

We have invested significant amounts of  our own funds into this product and now need your help with its completion and the building of the first levels of inventory.

As you might imagine, the uncertainties with suppliers, shipping and logistics can sometime impact our ability to produce our drive systems exactly how and when we would like. Your patience will be extremely appreciated and once again, we promise to provide bi-weekly updates to let everyone know how we are progressing.</p>

With your help, we also expect to begin our next product development -- an electric enhancement for off-road cyclists. It is projected to be a 4-5lb (2kg) . system (including batteries) driving the rear wheel by chain-drive and providing up to 90nm of torque for more rapid hill climbing, but still simply following the riders effort. The most unique feature will be the addition of high output regenerative braking for safer hill descents and longer trail time.

Special consideration will be given to our early supporters, when this next gen design is ready for funding.</p>

<br/>
<p><i>
<b>How far and how fast can I go with  ME n' E?</b></i><br/>
The  run time and distance must vary with the weight and strength of the rider. It also varies with terrain. Each country has its maximum speed limits, we will offer systems that meet national and local laws. Europe generally is 16 mph - (25 kph) and in the US 20 mph (32 kph)top speed, where applicable.  The distance can vary from 10-15 mi per charge(16-24 km).
</p>
<p><i><b>
If the goal is not met, will funds be returned?</b></i><br/>
Yes, if the goal is far short of what is needed, we will return all funds.
</p>
<p><i><b>
What kinds of bikes will work with  ME n' E?</b></i><br/>
Most bikes will work with our several mounting options- we will work with you to try to find solutions for custom designs or unusual frame styles. Most tire types will work but road tires with a smooth center or""slicks"", work best. It even works in the rain and wet.
</p>
<p><i><b>
When might I get my ordered unit?</b></i><br/>
Each unit will be shipped in the order it was received. It should be no longer than 40 days from the close of the campaign if you order is 1st received.
</p>
<p><i><b>How long will the battery last and how long between charges?</b></i><br/>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The battery has an expected life of 500-800 cycles. This also dependent on the rate of discharge, low discharge( you doing a lot of the work) it could exceed 1000hrs. It takes 5 hrs with the standard charger, about 2+ on the high rate charger.
</span></p>
<p><i><b>
Is this like the Add-E and some other friction drive systems?</b></i><br/>
Yes, and no. This is sturdy aluminum based motor mounting system that relies more on the software than the motor power. We are all friction-drive based but that is where the similarities end. Our system is intended to help you enjoy biking and not  replace your effort. The others ( Add - E, etc) , try to make your bike into an ebike that requires you to pedal to make it start but it then overrides your effort. We ask, ""Whats the point of riding a bike if something else is doing the work?""</p><p><b><i>Is shipping included ?</i></b> No, we give you the choice and rather than estimate the worst case charges and add them to the price, we will offer multiple shipping options and payment arrangements.</p>

Weighs only 2lbs  (.9kg)

2-minute installation (no tools required)
Cost starts at under $200 (250 watt system)

Other unique and proprietary features include:


Sensorless power matching algorithm, shift notification, and 1 wire connection.

We are offering 3 models and a completed, lightweight bike (see perks).
 

Our small team of engineers and designers  -includes the co-founder of ZAP bikes, the previous project head of the Corbin Sparrow, the designer of the world’s first folding electric scooter, and many other e-bike and electric power industry contributions -- both as designers, environmentalists, publishers and CEO's. We come with a wealth of business, ebike, and environmental ""street cred"".




ME n' E, unlike some other products, is not intended to make your bike into an e-bike -- but to create a fusion of your pedaling effort with clean electric power.  The added electric power flattens the feel of hills, enhances your ride, and reduces your sweat -- all while putting a big smile on your face.


ME n' E uses friction contact with the tire, like several other low-weight drives. The motor drive roller presses into the tire to transmit power and is activated by your initial pedal cadence. When the motor senses that you have begun pedaling, the system begins simulating the power you are providing and the power increases, as you increase your effort. If you cease to maintain the same pace or effort, the system reduces power to match what your are providing.


You cannot trick the system to provide power if you do not provide your own. The experience is the most natural and exhilarating you may ever have on a bike. Human effort and electric power just simply go well together.


This is not a simple cadence throttle, as ME n' E's software knows when your effort is greater -- even if your legs are not moving quickly.


The system will also let you know when it is time to shift gears, as it pauses when you have reached the maximum rpm for the gear ratio.  The momentary pause signals that it’s time to shift.


ME n' E does its magic by adding power whenever you add power, but without using sensors and wires.  It knows when you need help by using a proprietary algorithm.  It takes no tools or skills to install or remove in 2 minutes or less.


We wanted to make the system feel like normal cycling, allowing normal exercise, while having only a 2-lb (.9kg). weight penalty (batteries included), making time on your bike  feel even better than you might expect.









The sequential images in the video below show the mounting steps, and the rest is simply up to your legs.


There are 2 mounting types: 

Rear-seat stay support bar:  for bike with rear through hole for old style brakes or rear reflectors
Seat-tube mount:  both take one through bolt and  a thumb nut to install. This mount works well with most   hybrid bike models.

 After a quick install, just  connect the power plug, listen to the beep sequence and start pedaling.







We still have software and tooling of a few components to complete. Both should take about 3 weeks.  Once this step is completed, we will begin building units to ship. $35,000 is our goal to get both tooling, and software completed and to fulfill the initial orders.


We have invested significant amounts of  our own funds into this product and now need your help with its completion and the building of the first levels of inventory.

 Your help will allow us to bring this low cost product to the world and allow next generation products to make electric enhanced transportation a significant option for powering human mobility, while keeping us fit.







 




Your help will allow us to begin shipping our first units of ME n' E around May 18th -- still in time for Summer enjoyment.  Join us in adding more fun while keeping active in cycling!  

We expect to treat our supporters as we would like to be treated, by providing semi-weekly updates and sharing the sources of any schedule changes. The world of commerce does not allow an exact scheduling science and we have based our timing on normal outcomes, outsourced work and materials.

Our commitment and Staying in touch: 

Our promise to our supporters is that we will always operate with open transparency, keep you updated with our progress and overall, treat our supporters as we would like to be treated. As you might imagine, the uncertainties with suppliers, shipping and logistics can sometime impact our ability to produce our drive systems exactly how and when we would like. Your patience will be extremely appreciated and once again, we promise to provide bi-weekly updates to let everyone know how we are progressing.
 We also need your feedback , as the products are received and put to use.









With your help, we also expect to begin our next product development -- an electric enhancement for off-road cyclists. It is projected to be a 4-5lb (2kg) . system (including batteries) driving the rear wheel by chain-drive and providing up to 90nm of torque for more rapid hill climbing, but still simply following the riders effort. The most unique feature will be the addition of high output regenerative braking for safer hill descents and longer trail time.

Special consideration will be given to our early supporters, when this next gen design is ready for funding.





How far and how fast can I go with  ME n' E?
The  run time and distance must vary with the weight and strength of the rider. It also varies with terrain. Each country has its maximum speed limits, we will offer systems that meet national and local laws. Europe generally is 16 mph - (25 kph) and in the US 20 mph (32 kph)top speed, where applicable.  The distance can vary from 10-15 mi per charge(16-24 km).


If the goal is not met, will funds be returned?
Yes, if the goal is far short of what is needed, we will return all funds.


What kinds of bikes will work with  ME n' E?
Most bikes will work with our several mounting options- we will work with you to try to find solutions for custom designs or unusual frame styles. Most tire types will work but road tires with a smooth center or""slicks"", work best. It even works in the rain and wet.


When might I get my ordered unit?
Each unit will be shipped in the order it was received. It should be no longer than 40 days from the close of the campaign if you order is 1st received.

How long will the battery last and how long between charges?
The battery has an expected life of 500-800 cycles. This also dependent on the rate of discharge, low discharge( you doing a lot of the work) it could exceed 1000hrs. It takes 5 hrs with the standard charger, about 2+ on the high rate charger.


Is this like the Add-E and some other friction drive systems?
Yes, and no. This is sturdy aluminum based motor mounting system that relies more on the software than the motor power. We are all friction-drive based but that is where the similarities end. Our system is intended to help you enjoy biking and not  replace your effort. The others ( Add - E, etc) , try to make your bike into an ebike that requires you to pedal to make it start but it then overrides your effort. We ask, ""Whats the point of riding a bike if something else is doing the work?""Is shipping included ? No, we give you the choice and rather than estimate the worst case charges and add them to the price, we will offer multiple shipping options and payment arrangements.


We do not feel there are risks beyond those of normal life accidents with our ability to deliver these systems. When we reach our minimum goal, our only challenge is to complete work we’ve started, and we already have confidence in the design.
 Having started and succeeded with numerous technology based businesses and our many years of experience with bikes, electric vehicles and motors, we are humbly confident in our abilities to bring ME n' E to production, for you.


You can also help by sharing our story and ME n' E with friends and family -- or just order your own.

If we reach our goal with your help, we will honor any pricing on orders for 6 months beyond the ending of our campaign -- so no one will be left wanting or wondering.",19.0,1,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","More than just a Rucksack!!
Anyone know where the beach towel is, what about the rucksack and bag to put valuables in, also something comfortable to rest my head on.... familiar and something we wanted to find a solution too. 
The concept actually came from my grandma who came up with the idea to sow my beach towel into my rucksack to stop me from losing it. The first time I visited the pool I had numerous people asking me where I bought that great bag and towel set from and that's where the walkbag started. 

How to use?

As an inquisitive kind of guy who always looks for solutions to problems I started work on a design and a couple of years down the line after testing every fabric and idea imaginable the walkbag is now a fully functioning product that we want to deliver to mass market. 











Personalise your design

In volumes the bag and towel can be totally personalised making it not only a brilliant product for consumers but also a great promotional tool for business. It comes in adult and junior version and we have a version with a super soft baby towel for new babies.








In summary

The walkbag is a rucksack and beach towel in one. It is designed to give plenty of room when its a rucksack so you can still store all your needs for a visit to either the pool or beach. There's an in built waterproof zipped pocket to store your valuable, an inflatable head rest that slides into a well designed sleeve. 
The Walkbag comes in various colours and we are looking to make more designs. we have various towel options and the investment will help us to work on designs and fabrics and expanding to deliver a global product.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","'There is no such thing as bad weather, just inappropriate clothing'
The team comprises of Elaine Sykes, creator and her daughter's best friend Nadine McGurk who will lead on business development for the company.  
  



Together they want to bring the WellyWetSuit to the masses and through the support of this campaign they will be able to make a dream come true! Your pledges will make such a massive difference and it will help launch the business and help us bring the product to market this summer.

So we have a mother (Elaine) and a seasoned festival go-er (Nadine)
Elaine has had to deal with the mounds of ruined, mud
soaked clothes and her children expecting them to be washed cleaned and ironed
and repaired back to their former glory after a weekend of chaos camping out at
a Music Festival…. Yeah I know some chance….
Nadine has been to over 15 camping festivals and has some
serious horror stories not fit for this page. 
Weeks planning to be the epitome of boho chic only to get there and covering
all her good work by wrapping herself in anything that she deemed waterproof…
one year she wrapped her blown down tent round her to keep her last dry piece
of clothing protected.  The joys of UK
& Irish summer weather eh?? 
This journey has  been 4 years in the making.  We are currently 'chiclets' in Belfast's first ever Entrepreneurial Spark programme which is helping us accelerate our business to the next level through mentorship and accessing local networks.  Initially with the help and continued support of our local college Belfast Met we were able to create the prototype of our unique ‘Waterproof Onesie’ to
provide greater protection from rain at outdoor events and we called our baby the….....   Welly Wet Suit

The product offers;



 Head to toe waterproof protection


 Transparency so that your fashion silhouette is not
compromised


Reflector Tabs


Peaked hood to keep the rain off your face


Ventilation so you don’t get all sweaty wearing it (we have thought of everything!) 


Adjustable waist, wrists and ankles

Reusable for your next outing ...... pack this instead of your umbrella! 
Obscure pockets to keep your valuables safe and
hidden (and of course your hands free for throwing them shapes! YAAAAAAAAAA

Have a look at our lovely prototype:




What We Need & What You Get




This is where you come in!!! As well as being our first customers we need your pledges to raise £50,000 which will help us get into full
production and test sell this summer with the finished product but all pledges
will make a difference to the team, hence our decision to use flexible funding. 
Your pledges will support;




Product development


Initiate phase one of suit production


Raise the company’s profile at local festivals





So if you're reading this going £25k is a bit high isn't it ladies?!!! Look if we don't meet our target we will put all support to good use to perfect the finished product and use what we have to build
the foundations of the company... So don't panic we promise all
pledges will be honoured :) 
So you want in???.....Perk me up!!!!
What this campaign can offer you in exchange for your pledges are one off CRush art designed tshirts, WellyWetSuit's, Branded suits, Childern suits and an invite to the launch  and toast us onto the next stage of our journey! 





The Impact 
Think Titanic, Delorean, Mobile Heart Defibrillator, Tayto, Game of Thrones, Viagra, Air Conditioning, Vita Liberata ....... WellyWetSuit is going to be another one of those inventions/brands to come out of Northern Ireland that EVERYONE knows or uses! You can sit back and brag to your friends.... I was one of the first investors to get the WellyWetSuit out there... great ice breaker aswell!! 
We plan to initially target the music festival and events market.  But there is great scope for the suit to be used at all outdoor events, activities and spectator sporting events.   Hopefully following the success of this campaign we will use profits from the sales of the suits to launch a children and pet range of the WellyWetSuit... something the whole family can wear! 





The scope is endless.....



Risks & Challenges 
This is a pretty low risk campaign we have high hopes for
its success and we hope you love our product as much as we do.  We have chosen flexible funding as all
contributions are welcome.  We at
WellyWetSuit promise that all pledges and perks will be honoured and what we
receive we will put to good use for the company and it will be one step closer
to getting our product to market.

<p><b>What's the project about?<br/></b><br/>A fashion design collection of 8 looks (24 garments), hand-made and inspired in the idea of weight and lightness. I believe in fashion, we are losing the power of ideas, of artisanal techniques, of handmade and creativity, and mass production is winning the battle. Clothes serve the purpose of dressing, but can also serve the purpose of inspiring, of imagination, of creativity and beauty.</p>
<p>My aim is to concentrate in the way new technologies and materials affect fashion, and combine these with the traditional and artisanal techniques of her my own country, to create garments that people can feel represented in.<br/><br/></p>

</div></div>","Litost by Laura Searle For those who know me and those who don't, i know this sounds typical, but it's always been my dream, and i'm one of those who doesn't believe in luck, but in work, in overcoming struggle, in passion and love for what you do.
My dream is as simple and hard as this: being able to live from what i love, modestly, i don't need to be number one, i just want to share my passion with those who believe in it.
My passion? Fashion Design
The project: My graduation collection.
What's the project about?A fashion design collection of 8 looks (24 garments), hand-made and inspired in the idea of weight and lightness. I believe in fashion, we are losing the power of ideas, of artisanal techniques, of handmade and creativity, and mass production is winning the battle. Clothes serve the purpose of dressing, but can also serve the purpose of inspiring, of imagination, of creativity and beauty.
My aim is to concentrate in the way new technologies and materials affect fashion, and combine these with the traditional and artisanal techniques of her my own country, to create garments that people can feel represented in.
What do i need, what do you get in exchange

 Behind each garment, each video, each photo there is a creative professional fighting hard to create something beautiful, investing all their free time and resources that are not normally valued. People can't work for free...Team participating in this project:

Seamstress: only sewing each garment is around 70-150€
Myself: doing all the patterns and sewing everything i can

<h3>The Story Behind Twisted Mustard Seed</h3>
<p>""Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you""</p>
<p>Matthew 17:20 has been a guiding scripture in my life and my faith based view of parenting. In 2011 God blessed my husband and I with one of HIS beautifully hand crafted gifts, a baby boy named Austin. Unaware of the journey that was ahead of us, we knew that no matter the challenges, with confidence and trust in God’s plan for our family we could move mountains.</p>
<p>In 2013 we welcomed our newest gem, Miss Ava. Adding to our growing family was the easy part! Keeping that strong, faith based foundation could have been a challenge. As new parents, and parents with growing families, you tend to fall into repetitious routines that can steer you away from what held your bond together, FAITH.</p>
<p>As a Mother of two, I’ve questioned my “place” in the world as an individual. I wasn’t sure of the professional path God wanted me on. Before staying home with my children, I had a great job with a Fortune 100 company. But, I always felt an indescribable emptiness on how I could give and show my unique 1%. With faith and years of prayer, in September 2014 I got my answer. The name Twisted Mustard Seed was placed on my heart, but I had no clue why. When I mentioned this to my husband, he quoted the scripture that has been our guiding light as parents (Matthew 17:20). I then knew I was meant to design something around my greatest gifts - my precious babies!</p>
<p>Raising children has been the most profound happiness of my life. But from this happiness came one of my biggest heartaches…my diaper bag! For years I’ve felt my diaper bag was an organizational necessity but not a reflection of myself. I’d always wanted a “staple piece” with the functionality of a diaper bag. Also, with my husband being an involved hands-on Dad, I wanted to have a bag that allowed him to be able to showcase fatherhood, without feminine overtones. With these ideas in mind, I began Twisted Mustard Seed. I set out to create a brand that understands the journey you go through as parents, parents to-be, and caregivers. With FAITH as small as a mustard seed you can move mountains!</p>

I realized
that kids today are bombarded with distractions on the internet making it hard for them to observe the proper times for prayer no
matter how many times their parents remind them.                       Lifelong habits, good or bad,
begin in childhood



When I saw my nephew struggling to remember the correct times to
pray I purchased him a prayer watch, but he hated how heavy, complicated, and
ill-fitting it was. That was my ah-ha moment, I knew what I had to do and
immediately began designing what is the first kid-approved prayer watch.
I knew that kids did not want to wear any of the heavy and complicated prayer watches produced for adults, and would prefer a more personal device

</h3> <p> For The Good Period (4TGP) helps girls in the developing world stay in school. We're
 a group of six passionately committed individuals working to make a 
difference in the lives of girls in the developing world by removing two
 of the major barriers to their education: inadequate understanding of 
reproductive health (which increases teen pregnancy and disease) and 
lack of access to sanitary pads. One of us ––our founder, Kayce Anderson–– is a 
visionary idealist with a PhD. Another, Sadler Merrill –– our awesome, empathetic male–– is a grounded and savvy entrepreneur. Our communications director, Kate Lapides, is a dedicated documentary
 photographer with a passion for life above 10,000 feet; our programs director, Molly Secor-Turner ––another PhD–– is a socially progressive nurse and reproductive 
health educator who is also an Avett Brothers groupie. Jessica Lindsley, our development assistant is a 
yogi who advises non-profits on thoughtful donor development. And our Kenyan outreach coordinator, Sharon Secor, is
 an indefatigable grandmother who has been improving rural health care 
and helping build schools in Kenya for over two decades. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In
 2015 For the Good Period became an official non-profit. A few months 
later we made our inaugural trip to Kenya  to distribute reproductive 
health education and sustainable menstrual hygiene kits – durable and 
good for three years –– to 1,000 girls in rural villages. We documented the girls' hopes, struggles and dreams on that trip 
because we believe photography and video can be powerful tools in 
sharing their stories and raising awareness of the issues they face, 
which include pressure to drop out of school, marry early, and undergo 
female genital mutilation (FGM.) <br/></p>
<p>Our passionate belief that girls around the world should be able to stay in school and achieve their dreams is what propels us to do our work. What
 will you gain by supporting our campaign?  Nothing less than helping us remove a major, but resolvable, barrier to education for thousands of adolescent Kenyan girls.<br/>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>OUR CAMPAIGN:<br/>
</h3>We hope to use photography exhibits and video to raise funds 
for additional distribution and reproductive health education sessions to another 1,000 girls in Kenya in 2016.  Our belief is that sharing the hopes and struggles of adolescent girls around the world though compelling photography can attract potential donors for our work. Additionally, profits from all sales of prints from our exhibits will go directly to fund 4TGP's work. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>WHAT WE NEED (&amp; What You Get!):</h3>
<p>We are requesting $2550 to cover the production costs of a traveling photography exhibit that highlights the stories of girls who benefited from our September, 2015 distribution trip to Kenya. The first exhibit kicks off the Colorado Mountain College in Aspen Gallery space and takes place from January 25-May 6, 2016. All profits from sales of prints at our exhibits will be used to support
 the manufacture and distribution of pads to an additional 1,000 girls in rural Tharaka-Nithi County, Kenya. Additional funds raised will be used for expanded distributions to additional girls in Kenya and potentially the neighboring country of Malawi in 2016-2017. <br/></p>
<p>What do you get for supporting our work? The deep satisfaction of being part of a solution that helps thousands of beautiful girls stay in school, have a better chance to reach their potential and ultimately, improve the health of their communities.  You can also acquire some beautifully crafted photographs as either note cards or prints as a reminder of the girls whose lives you have helped change for the better. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES:</h3> <p> Community development work and aid distribution in developing countries often provides many challenges. There are always potentials for cultural miscommunication and misuse of donated funds. <br/></p>
<p>For the Good Period addresses these potential hurdles by partnering with trusted friends and staff on the ground in Kenya. Half of our U.S. staff has cultivated these relationships over the course of twenty years of development work in Kenya in the region where we work.

  For The Good Period (4TGP) helps girls in the developing world stay in school. We're
 a group of six passionately committed individuals working to make a 
difference in the lives of girls in the developing world by removing two
 of the major barriers to their education: inadequate understanding of 
reproductive health (which increases teen pregnancy and disease) and 
lack of access to sanitary pads. One of us ––our founder, Kayce Anderson–– is a 
visionary idealist with a PhD. Another, Sadler Merrill –– our awesome, empathetic male–– is a grounded and savvy entrepreneur. Our communications director, Kate Lapides, is a dedicated documentary
 photographer with a passion for life above 10,000 feet; our programs director, Molly Secor-Turner ––another PhD–– is a socially progressive nurse and reproductive 
health educator who is also an Avett Brothers groupie. Jessica Lindsley, our development assistant is a 
yogi who advises non-profits on thoughtful donor development. And our Kenyan outreach coordinator, Sharon Secor, is
 an indefatigable grandmother who has been improving rural health care 
and helping build schools in Kenya for over two decades. 


In
 2015 For the Good Period became an official non-profit. A few months 
later we made our inaugural trip to Kenya  to distribute reproductive 
health education and sustainable menstrual hygiene kits – durable and 
good for three years –– to 1,000 girls in rural villages. We documented the girls' hopes, struggles and dreams on that trip 
because we believe photography and video can be powerful tools in 
sharing their stories and raising awareness of the issues they face, 
which include pressure to drop out of school, marry early, and undergo 
female genital mutilation (FGM.) 
Our passionate belief that girls around the world should be able to stay in school and achieve their dreams is what propels us to do our work. What
 will you gain by supporting our campaign?  Nothing less than helping us remove a major, but resolvable, barrier to education for thousands of adolescent Kenyan girls.


OUR CAMPAIGN:
We hope to use photography exhibits and video to raise funds 
for additional distribution and reproductive health education sessions to another 1,000 girls in Kenya in 2016.  Our belief is that sharing the hopes and struggles of adolescent girls around the world though compelling photography can attract potential donors for our work. Additionally, profits from all sales of prints from our exhibits will go directly to fund 4TGP's work. 
  WHAT WE NEED (& What You Get!):
We are requesting $2550 to cover the production costs of a traveling photography exhibit that highlights the stories of girls who benefited from our September, 2015 distribution trip to Kenya. The first exhibit kicks off the Colorado Mountain College in Aspen Gallery space and takes place from January 25-May 6, 2016. All profits from sales of prints at our exhibits will be used to support
 the manufacture and distribution of pads to an additional 1,000 girls in rural Tharaka-Nithi County, Kenya. Additional funds raised will be used for expanded distributions to additional girls in Kenya and potentially the neighboring country of Malawi in 2016-2017. 
What do you get for supporting our work? The deep satisfaction of being part of a solution that helps thousands of beautiful girls stay in school, have a better chance to reach their potential and ultimately, improve the health of their communities.  You can also acquire some beautifully crafted photographs as either note cards or prints as a reminder of the girls whose lives you have helped change for the better. 
   RISKS & CHALLENGES:  Community development work and aid distribution in developing countries often provides many challenges. There are always potentials for cultural miscommunication and misuse of donated funds. 
For the Good Period addresses these potential hurdles by partnering with trusted friends and staff on the ground in Kenya. Half of our U.S. staff has cultivated these relationships over the course of twenty years of development work in Kenya in the region where we work. This ensures that our communication and education regarding the sensitive issues of reproductive health are culturally appropriate and that our programs begin with the vetted input of the communities we serve.

<h3><b>Special Fabric</b></h3>
<div>
<p>Our new shirts are made with  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478092054/na52ob2nzwsmm7emsw4w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> ring spun into fine yarns and knitted into a circa 170gsm single jersey fabric this is probably unique in the t shirt market.  For us the use of these fibres was a means to an end - to have quality t shirts that could be comfortably worn regularly - essentially matching the quality and thought and skill that went into the art decorating them.  But in fact the quality and performance of the shirts makes them worthy of being an end in themselves. We had to commission the manufacture of 8 tonnes of the fibres.  </span></font></p>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We believe the use of these fibres ring spun for t shirts is a first and so does the manufacturer, Invista.  Having had the fibres precisely ring spun into yarn all but the </span>grey yarns were dyed into our colours and <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">then knitted into fabric.  The result is a lightweight, luxurious and breathable shirt that wicks away moisture and kills bacteria for the life of the garment.  These qualities are unaffected to any significant extent by wear or washing because both qualities are engineered into the fibres not applied onto them.  </span></font>The wicking and anti microbial effects are permanent.</p>
<div>These qualities make the shirts marvellous to travel with:   They wash easily and dry quickly but if you can’t wash them for a day or three they stay fresh and will not become malodorous.  They wash well because washing is wicking in reverse: its quick and easy, the water and detergent penetrate and have an accelerated flow through the fibres. Finally the shirts dry more quickly than any t shirt you have previously owned and absolutely do not need to be ironed.   There is another particular advantage, travelling or otherwise - whatever you might wear with the shirts remains fresher too because bacteria do not get beyond the silvery embrace of your t shirt .  </div>

<div> </div>
<div>
<p>The ongoing performance of the fabric is guaranteed. This is important because we know you will want to wear your shirt again and again.</p>
<div><h3><b>Dyeing vs Printing</b></h3></div>
<div>We dye the designs into the fabric at 720 dpi in one axis and 1440dpi in the other.   We do not print onto the the surface of the shirt.  Despite the full CMYK colour reproduction and the high resolution there is no hand feel to the decorated areas.  There is no change to the drape, the decorated areas breathe in the same way as the undecorated areas.  The size of the decorated area and the intensity of the colours in the images are immaterial.</div>

(assuming a business/post day).  Later in the campaign it is conceivable that we will not be able to deliver a first choice of colour and size.  We will let you know, on this page, if this happens.</h3>

The cut and fit of these shirts was specified by Anastasia Vouyouka, a published guru of fit in the fashion industry.  There is a comprehensive size table below. Size Chart The IdeaWeAdmire create t-shirts with designs by artists with one common theme: They all depict something or someone admired. Expression through admiration is the motivation behind WeAdmire. The enjoyment of admiration is universal, not limited by topic or geography and enriched by culture.You may already know the WeAdmire store in London, now we are expanding.  The objective is to grow our business internationally both physically ,""bricks""  and electronically, ""clicks"". We will start with a physical expansion of our business by moving the majority of our production to a new venue that is physically better suited to the storage and production of shirts than our existing studio.  To fund this expansion, WeAdmire are offering t-shirts at reduced prices with no shipping costs.

The Shirts

Every t-shirt has an artist and a story and some details of both are reproduced on a special panel inside the shirt.

Special Fabric

Our new shirts are made with   ring spun into fine yarns and knitted into a circa 170gsm single jersey fabric this is probably unique in the t shirt market.  For us the use of these fibres was a means to an end - to have quality t shirts that could be comfortably worn regularly - essentially matching the quality and thought and skill that went into the art decorating them.  But in fact the quality and performance of the shirts makes them worthy of being an end in themselves. We had to commission the manufacture of 8 tonnes of the fibres.  
We believe the use of these fibres ring spun for t shirts is a first and so does the manufacturer, Invista.  Having had the fibres precisely ring spun into yarn all but the grey yarns were dyed into our colours and then knitted into fabric.  The result is a lightweight, luxurious and breathable shirt that wicks away moisture and kills bacteria for the life of the garment.  These qualities are unaffected to any significant extent by wear or washing because both qualities are engineered into the fibres not applied onto them.  The wicking and anti microbial effects are permanent.
These qualities make the shirts marvellous to travel with:   They wash easily and dry quickly but if you can’t wash them for a day or three they stay fresh and will not become malodorous.  They wash well because washing is wicking in reverse: its quick and easy, the water and detergent penetrate and have an accelerated flow through the fibres. Finally the shirts dry more quickly than any t shirt you have previously owned and absolutely do not need to be ironed.   There is another particular advantage, travelling or otherwise - whatever you might wear with the shirts remains fresher too because bacteria do not get beyond the silvery embrace of your t shirt .  

 

The ongoing performance of the fabric is guaranteed. This is important because we know you will want to wear your shirt again and again.
Dyeing vs Printing
We dye the designs into the fabric at 720 dpi in one axis and 1440dpi in the other.   We do not print onto the the surface of the shirt.  Despite the full CMYK colour reproduction and the high resolution there is no hand feel to the decorated areas.  There is no change to the drape, the decorated areas breathe in the same way as the undecorated areas.  The size of the decorated area and the intensity of the colours in the images are immaterial.
 


Delivery
Early birds will have their shirts the working day after they pledge their support but in any case everyone who makes a pledge should have their shirts within a month of the end of the campaign.
 
Visit Us
Please feel free to visit us and perhaps collect your reward and or watch it being produced.  Our conventional address: 13-15 Great Eastern Street, London EC2A 3EJ.  Our what3words location: glove.jabs.young  We expect to be here 7 days a week for the duration of the campaign and until all the rewards are produced and posted.  Beyond that we will be closed on Sundays.  From 11am- 6pm on Saturdays but otherwise 9am - 6pm at least.

Risks

For early birds there is no risk you will not receive the reward we describe and you expect.  We have the physical stock of shirts - eight tonnes of fibre made 30,000 shirts.  And we have the library of artwork to reproduce on them.  Because the amount we want to raise is flexible we do not have to wait to hit a financial target. We will start to send the pledge rewards immediately.  For early pledges you should receive your shirts in the post the following day. (assuming a business/post day).  Later in the campaign it is conceivable that we will not be able to deliver a first choice of colour and size.  We will let you know, on this page, if this happens.",60.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Mission Tshared.eu: Zero Waste Fashion!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I know what my dream is: — Zero Waste fashion. And I know I  can’t get there all by myself. Fact is Tshared still is a small player in the global fashion industry. I want the big players to commit to Zero Waste as well. I want to prove to them that there is a better way, a smarter way to <b>BUY</b>. Here’s how my roadmap to Zero Waste looks like.</p>
<p><b>Phase 1:</b> Create awareness. Through it’s beautiful and unique T-shirts Tshared communicates it’s Zero Waste message, always and everywhere. Together with create blogs, video’s and other high quality content this will create awareness around Zero Waste. I also want you to enjoy your favorite t-shirt for as long as possible. For this I will help you take excellent care of your T-shirt with my great tips.</p>
<p><b>Phase 2:</b> Transparency from Seed to Tee. Because I want Tshared to be transparent about the total supply chain, I’ll  show you how your t-shirt is being produced and who makes your t-shirts. I believe that humans like you and me want to know the story behind the product you buy, because humans like to connect with other human beings and we love a good story.</p>
<p><b>Phase 3:</b> Be a role model. We love to be inspired by our fellow human beings who set an example. I want Tshared to be that role model and raise the awareness around doing business and contributing to the world at the same time. But I cannot achieve a Zero Waste fashion industry by myself.<b> I need your support, please join me NOW!</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What we do!</span><span style=""background-color: initial;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p><b>Concept: </b><a href=""http://bit.ly/2crsxKm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tshared </a>is an online platform which works together with unique  Graphic designers, and produces organic T-shirts which are sustainable and socially responsible and <b>handpicked by YOU!</b></p>
<p>I what to connect and create with you! I worked in the fashion industry since 1996, I had the privilege to work for several international fashion companies and I have seen with my own eyes, that their is no real connection with the consumers. Fashion companies just make products and try to convince YOU with a lot of expensive marketing to buy them, without asking YOUR opinion what you think of this product. Research shows that 30% of the produced garments YOU don't want to buy. By letting you choose what Tshared will produce, Tshared is able to save 30% <b>WASTE.</b></p>

</div></div>","Hey Indiegogo friend,Thanks for checking out my project.It’s been a wild ride, starting with my noticing that 30% of all clothing garments made into this world consumers don’t want to buy, that is 25 billion pieces each year meaning 32.000 Boeings 747 in KG. Say what?! AND the vast majority of even expensive fashion is made with poor materials.Before I knew it – and without much prior-knowledge – I was trying to find a European factory to make the superior product I had in mind. So far, so good.Fast forward and 2200 hours later, I've got unique graphic designs, the high quality fabrics and knowledge, and found a factory that needs this product as much as I need them... I just need €11.111,- to start producing your favorite T-shirts.Please support at whatever level you're comfortable with. I'll sent your unique Zero Waste T-shirt, crafted for comfort with super-high organic quality materials you’re going to love. If you’ve got the time though, be sure to read the info below as well, it’s wordy but worth it.Ready for the best part? Beyond this opening order, for every 111 pieces I sell, I can give two Children education for a year, so they can become whatever they want to be, instead of being forced working from the age of 7. Just imagine what a different life this child will have.Thanks for your support and enjoy your day! Jeroen TSHARED.EU Zero Waste T-shirt is....1. A Super Premium and unique graphic T-shirt made with only the finest of organic materials. It will grow into you the way your favorite T-shirt should — getting softer with wear, and keeps on adding stories along the way2. Transparency about our suppliers and margins on our products. Only then YOU as a consumer are able to make the right decision to buy a product.3. Built to last, every T-shirt tells a story, your story, please share it with us, we are proud of our products, our customers, YOU!4. Zero Waste. There is a 30% overproduction in the fashion industry,. Companies have systematically lowered your expectations about the quality of fashion clothes you buy to the point where it's hard to know what to expect anymore.It ends here NOW and it starts with a T-shirt!.5. A smarter way to BUY. You choose what we produce, a limited and unique tshirt on demand, made just for you!!6. A better way to manufacture - right here in Europe! By letting you choose what we produce we can shorten the supply chain, add value to other people's lives, and build a stronger connection between buyers and artists all at once.7. A game changer. No more competing with fast fashion. Let's slow down, make things worth keeping, back them with a better level of service and become a trendsetter!8. If you decide after five years , that you would like a new T-shirt and send it back to us we will give you 11% discount on your next purchase. Don't worry it is in good hands, we will Reuse, Recycle or Upcycle your T-shirt.9. Always limited and numbered edition T-shirts. Only 111 pieces will be made per graphic design, per T-shirt color.

Vision Tshared.eu: Why do we exist!
“ we inspire, educate, reduce overproduction, make unique high quality clothing on demand , are circular, contribute and connect, cause no unnecessary harm to planet and people ""
 
Mission Tshared.eu: Zero Waste Fashion!
 
I know what my dream is: — Zero Waste fashion. And I know I  can’t get there all by myself. Fact is Tshared still is a small player in the global fashion industry. I want the big players to commit to Zero Waste as well. I want to prove to them that there is a better way, a smarter way to BUY. Here’s how my roadmap to Zero Waste looks like.
Phase 1: Create awareness. Through it’s beautiful and unique T-shirts Tshared communicates it’s Zero Waste message, always and everywhere. Together with create blogs, video’s and other high quality content this will create awareness around Zero Waste. I also want you to enjoy your favorite t-shirt for as long as possible. For this I will help you take excellent care of your T-shirt with my great tips.
Phase 2: Transparency from Seed to Tee. Because I want Tshared to be transparent about the total supply chain, I’ll  show you how your t-shirt is being produced and who makes your t-shirts. I believe that humans like you and me want to know the story behind the product you buy, because humans like to connect with other human beings and we love a good story.
Phase 3: Be a role model. We love to be inspired by our fellow human beings who set an example. I want Tshared to be that role model and raise the awareness around doing business and contributing to the world at the same time. But I cannot achieve a Zero Waste fashion industry by myself. I need your support, please join me NOW!
What we do! 
Concept: Tshared is an online platform which works together with unique  Graphic designers, and produces organic T-shirts which are sustainable and socially responsible and handpicked by YOU!
I what to connect and create with you! I worked in the fashion industry since 1996, I had the privilege to work for several international fashion companies and I have seen with my own eyes, that their is no real connection with the consumers. Fashion companies just make products and try to convince YOU with a lot of expensive marketing to buy them, without asking YOUR opinion what you think of this product. Research shows that 30% of the produced garments YOU don't want to buy. By letting you choose what Tshared will produce, Tshared is able to save 30% WASTE.
My promise!


My FIRST GOAL of €11.111,-  is needed to start producing the first batch of 111 unique graphic T-shirts, kickstart Tshared and give 2 children education for one full year through the Honest Clothing Foundation.


 
Financial Transparency circle of cost T-shirt


I believe that if you want to make a conscious decision you need to be informed about the price structure of the T-shirts and products you buy in general. That is why I’ll show you how I spend your money and what everybody earns on a product. Imagine if all companies would do this!
 


 

Finacial Transparency Retail Mark up / Gross Profit (How much do we earn on 1 T-shirt)

I believe that if you want to make a conscious decision you need to be informed about the price structure of the T-shirts and products you buy in general. Below you are able to see how we devide the margin on our T-shirt after the production cost and what we really earn on a T-shirt. Imagine if all companies would do this!

<br/>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The
Editor was created by two editors Sienna De L’Orpaz and Dolly Mirpuri who
noticed a troubling consistency in publications: all the models are skinny
beyond imagination, light skinned, blue eyed, and tower at 6 feet tall. Even
living in Asia, most publications and castings favor Caucasian models over
Asian. Publications flock to the reigning fashion houses for advertising and
clothing for editorials, while small, innovative, and groundbreaking
small-time designers have to resort to blogs and other forms of social media
where their presence isn’t taken seriously.</p>
<p>Large-scale transitions in
societies are associated with both individual behavioral change and
restructuring of the social network. Our mission is to make that transition and
restructuring within the industry to bring ethnic diversity and body diversity
into the fashion industry so that it’s not merely
obligatory. To tell, not only magazines, but also other media systems
that society is ready for them to be wholly representative of the
diverse communities that they serve, opposed to the homogeneous, unrealistic
population currently represented. Contrary to popular belief, magazines aren’t
embracing diversity. From 2014 to 2015 there was only a 0.1% Improvement in
diversity on magazine covers (From 19.7% to 19.8%).</p>
<p>The fashion industry and its publications are still
discriminating; and an imbalanced and sometimes even unhealthy ideal of beauty
is being pushed onto vulnerable young girls, women, and even men all over
the world. “Ethnic women on the cover don’t sell magazines.”
That mainstream market propaganda masquerading as fact has long been accepted
as truth, but we don’t buy it. There is a long way to go in shifting the perception of beauty but we want to lead by example; we want to challenge the
ideals of beauty and fashion into a much more colorful, accepting, diverse
image. <b><i>We want a change.</i></b></p>
<p>We
want to be a diverse publication: One that is inclusive of minorities and
people in content, employment, and, even ownership. We don’t only want to
present diversity in the end result, we want to be the definition of diversity
as a company to reflect the broad communities that we serve and represent.
As a matter of fact, we believe that the disproportionate lack of women and
minority owners is a direct cause of the lack of diverse voices, images
and viewpoints. We want to change the homogeneous and racialised hierarchies of
beauty that permeate the high fashion industry.</p>
<p>We
want small brands to be appreciated and heard as much as the big fashion
houses. We want models of all sizes, races, genders, and cultures. We want
you, our readers, to model high fashion clothes and feel as beautiful as
Giselle or Bar, because you are. In every Issue we will feature a high
fashion editorial with real people you can relate to. We will use curvy, large,
light skinned, dark skinned, redheads, freckled faces,
albinos, trans-gendered men and women, and more to promote a more
inclusive and respectful idea of diversity.</p>

<h3>What’s in
the first issue?</h3>
<p>Our
first issue of The Editor explores conformity, and the rebellion against it. </p>
<p><i>“Conformity is a type of social influence
involving a change in belief or behavior in order to fit in with a group.This change is in response to real (involving
the physical presence of others) or imagined (involving the pressure of social
norms / expectations) group pressure. The term
conformity is often used to indicate an agreement to the majority position,
brought about either by a desire to ‘fit in’ or be liked (normative) or
because of a desire to be correct (informational), or simply to conform to a
social role (identification).”</i></p>
<p>We felt that the word conformity was a great subject
to explore in our first issue. You will find editorials, articles, visuals,
interviews, features and more exploring the subject. We focus on designers,
artists, curators, musicians, and people of different cultures from all over the world. </p>

<h3>The

<p>The Editor Publishing will publish The Editor Magazine: The
first intercultural high fashion magazine. The
magazine is high gloss, 80-100 pages, contemporary in look and appeal. Quality
fashion and editorial content that is rich in diverse voices, viewpoints,
and images is the constant goal. The magazine will
be entertaining and newsworthy, inspiration invoking, and thought provoking. It
will appeal to a broad readership.</p>
<p>In year 3, The Editor Publishing will
release an annual hardcover book, along with paperback books with hardcover
limited edition versions. Contemporary high fashion as well as diversity and
body image themes will prevail particularly those that contemplate the demands
and ideals forced onto men and women by the industry.</p>

The Impact
The
Editor was created by two editors Sienna De L’Orpaz and Dolly Mirpuri who
noticed a troubling consistency in publications: all the models are skinny
beyond imagination, light skinned, blue eyed, and tower at 6 feet tall. Even
living in Asia, most publications and castings favor Caucasian models over
Asian. Publications flock to the reigning fashion houses for advertising and
clothing for editorials, while small, innovative, and groundbreaking
small-time designers have to resort to blogs and other forms of social media
where their presence isn’t taken seriously.
Large-scale transitions in
societies are associated with both individual behavioral change and
restructuring of the social network. Our mission is to make that transition and
restructuring within the industry to bring ethnic diversity and body diversity
into the fashion industry so that it’s not merely
obligatory. To tell, not only magazines, but also other media systems
that society is ready for them to be wholly representative of the
diverse communities that they serve, opposed to the homogeneous, unrealistic
population currently represented. Contrary to popular belief, magazines aren’t
embracing diversity. From 2014 to 2015 there was only a 0.1% Improvement in
diversity on magazine covers (From 19.7% to 19.8%).
The fashion industry and its publications are still
discriminating; and an imbalanced and sometimes even unhealthy ideal of beauty
is being pushed onto vulnerable young girls, women, and even men all over
the world. “Ethnic women on the cover don’t sell magazines.”
That mainstream market propaganda masquerading as fact has long been accepted
as truth, but we don’t buy it. There is a long way to go in shifting the perception of beauty but we want to lead by example; we want to challenge the
ideals of beauty and fashion into a much more colorful, accepting, diverse
image. We want a change.
We
want to be a diverse publication: One that is inclusive of minorities and
people in content, employment, and, even ownership. We don’t only want to
present diversity in the end result, we want to be the definition of diversity
as a company to reflect the broad communities that we serve and represent.
As a matter of fact, we believe that the disproportionate lack of women and
minority owners is a direct cause of the lack of diverse voices, images
and viewpoints. We want to change the homogeneous and racialised hierarchies of
beauty that permeate the high fashion industry.
We
want small brands to be appreciated and heard as much as the big fashion
houses. We want models of all sizes, races, genders, and cultures. We want
you, our readers, to model high fashion clothes and feel as beautiful as
Giselle or Bar, because you are. In every Issue we will feature a high
fashion editorial with real people you can relate to. We will use curvy, large,
light skinned, dark skinned, redheads, freckled faces,
albinos, trans-gendered men and women, and more to promote a more
inclusive and respectful idea of diversity.







What’s in
the first issue?
Our
first issue of The Editor explores conformity, and the rebellion against it. 
“Conformity is a type of social influence
involving a change in belief or behavior in order to fit in with a group.This change is in response to real (involving
the physical presence of others) or imagined (involving the pressure of social
norms / expectations) group pressure. The term
conformity is often used to indicate an agreement to the majority position,
brought about either by a desire to ‘fit in’ or be liked (normative) or
because of a desire to be correct (informational), or simply to conform to a
social role (identification).”
We felt that the word conformity was a great subject
to explore in our first issue. You will find editorials, articles, visuals,
interviews, features and more exploring the subject. We focus on designers,
artists, curators, musicians, and people of different cultures from all over the world. 



The
Editor Print
The Editor Publishing will publish The Editor Magazine: The
first intercultural high fashion magazine. The
magazine is high gloss, 80-100 pages, contemporary in look and appeal. Quality
fashion and editorial content that is rich in diverse voices, viewpoints,
and images is the constant goal. The magazine will
be entertaining and newsworthy, inspiration invoking, and thought provoking. It
will appeal to a broad readership.
In year 3, The Editor Publishing will
release an annual hardcover book, along with paperback books with hardcover
limited edition versions. Contemporary high fashion as well as diversity and
body image themes will prevail particularly those that contemplate the demands
and ideals forced onto men and women by the industry.



The Editor Digital
 
Both The Editor’s website and digital replica edition will be
compatible with a range of mobile and tablet devices. Our digital replicas are
high quality, page-turning versions of the print edition. Some titles feature
enhancements, including video, image galleries, and web links. In year 2, our
digital editions will come in two varieties – digital replicas or interactive
iPad editions. 


TheEditorMagazine.com
TheEditorMagazine.com
has been soft launched approximately two weeks ago for market validation. We
are proud to announce that we have been reaching our target audience
internationally and are already read in 14 countries. Since our website has
only been soft-launched it still does not have all the content uploaded, and we

footage, exclusive interviews, music, culture, art and fashion videos, plus

we offer a wide variety of custom content for advertisers.

<p><b>The Story</b></p>
<p></p>Pantheon was founded when Carrie was planning her wedding and needed gifts for her team of bridesmaids – all seven of them. On the hunt for something beautiful, memorable, and lasting, she decided on accessories as gifts to complement their outfits on the actual day. To her disappointment, she could not find any that could fit her designs in mind. Nothing she found was ‘just what she wanted’.<br/><br/>After spending months trying to find the perfect gift that would reflect her appreciation of their help, Carrie decided to come up with her very own design and have it manufactured. Having been exposed to jewellery design by her jeweller father from young, she enjoyed the process immensely and was estatic about the end product. During the hustle of wedding planning, she found that there were many other brides-to-be facing the same problem. She begun customising jewellery for them and they were well received. Soon after, Pantheon was born. <br/><br/>All Pantheon pieces are designed to impact the wearer with positivity and inspirations about life. Each piece carries with it a message to encourage and help one through any adversity or obstacles in life resulting in a happier soul and a happier life.<p></p>

We pour the clear glass base delicately into our mold and sprinkle it with hints of blue, green or brown as we <strong>prep this “canvas” for magic</strong>. The glass goes into a giant oven. Several days later, after appropriate cooling and incubation, out comes a shiny new panel of glass.

This is the big one. If we can get another kiln we’ll be able to produce more glass panels and give more glass a vibrant new story.

The glass crusher does just that! It crunches up all the glass we reclaim into tiny bits so we can re-melt it. We hope to purchase a new glass crusher that removes paper and foil for us so we don’t have to do this by hand, which will allow us to dramatically increase our efficiency. Additionally, we had to borrow money from a friend to purchase the one we’re currently using and we need to pay him back.</p><p><strong>Equipment and Space $6,825</strong></p><p>This effort is all about increasing efficiency and making improvements to our current processes. With this additional money we’ll be able to purchase new mold material that is necessary for creating our glass panels, and reimburse a friend who gave us money to pay for our current mold materials. We need an additional 1000 sq ft of rental space in our current building for storage and equipment. We need a walkie stacker, which helps us carefully stack glass panels in a pallet rack. Finally, we need a glass weighing scale to more effectively weigh the crushed glass for creating the surfaces.</p><p><strong>Marketing Support for 1 year $3,600</strong></p><p>No one will buy the product if they don’t know about it! We need a dedicated marketing budget so we can continue to get the word out about Evolution Glass.</p><h3>Your Gifts</h3><p>We're so grateful for any contribution you can make!

You’re doing your part to help reduce waste! You might guess it ends up as another pasta jar or beer bottle, right?Well maybe, but not likely. Most of it gets crushed up and used to create fiberglass, reflective road paint, gravel or cement. It's down-cycled and its story ends there.In comes Evolution Glass.We’re reimagining recycled glass by using it to create beautiful, functional art. We’re extending the story of this glass to create unique and innovative surfaces that become the centerpiece of any room. Our surfaces come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colors, and we're just getting started. What’s the process?We reclaim those sauce jars and wine bottles from a giant pile at the recycling transfer station here in Charlottesville, VA, haul it away in our truck, and take it back to our shop on Broadway Ave. This is where the next chapter begins.Each container hangs out in our one little dumpster behind the shop. We strip away the foil from all the wine bottles by hand. We dump a bucket full into our glass crusher and out comes a chunky sharp pile. We pour the clear glass base delicately into our mold and sprinkle it with hints of blue, green or brown as we prep this “canvas” for magic. The glass goes into a giant oven. Several days later, after appropriate cooling and incubation, out comes a shiny new panel of glass. Mesmerizing, ethereal and beautiful…from what was once a pile of discarded glass.Evolution Glass Tables & CountertopsEach of these pieces is in someone's home adding vibrancy, color and light. We've installed counters and delivered tables here in Central Virginia and have projects in Washington D.C., Richmond and Chicago in development.Evolution Glass ColorsWe use a clear glass base and add in brown, green and blue glass to create a variety of spectacular colors and patterns in our surfaces. No other glass surface in the world has this look and appeal. Each piece is unique. Our Goals & Your GiftsWe’re aiming for $18,000. When you help us reach that goal here’s where the funds will go:Another Kiln $8,000We use this to melt down the glass to make these gorgeous surfaces. This is the big one. If we can get another kiln we’ll be able to produce more glass panels and give more glass a vibrant new story. We'll be able to increase production rates so our cost per square foot will decrease making this awesome and sustainable material available to a wider population.Crowdfunding Support & Perks $8,100We’re fortunate to have a team that’s willing to help out without payment up front, but we’ll eventually need to pay them back for their time and efforts. We hired an awesome video production company, Pando Creative, to shoot our pitch video, and Heather has been working on this campaign, mostly unpaid, for nearly a year. We also need funds to cover the costs of all our awesome perks!Indiegogo and Payment Processing Fees $1,900Of course Indiegogo takes a cut of our fundraising as do PayPal and our credit card payment processor. These are costs that we can't afford to cover without help! If we exceed our goal here's what the funds will go towardGlass Crusher $14,500Another super important piece in this puzzle. The glass crusher does just that! It crunches up all the glass we reclaim into tiny bits so we can re-melt it. We hope to purchase a new glass crusher that removes paper and foil for us so we don’t have to do this by hand, which will allow us to dramatically increase our efficiency. Additionally, we had to borrow money from a friend to purchase the one we’re currently using and we need to pay him back.Equipment and Space $6,825This effort is all about increasing efficiency and making improvements to our current processes. With this additional money we’ll be able to purchase new mold material that is necessary for creating our glass panels, and reimburse a friend who gave us money to pay for our current mold materials. We need an additional 1000 sq ft of rental space in our current building for storage and equipment. We need a walkie stacker, which helps us carefully stack glass panels in a pallet rack. Finally, we need a glass weighing scale to more effectively weigh the crushed glass for creating the surfaces.Marketing Support for 1 year $3,600No one will buy the product if they don’t know about it! We need a dedicated marketing budget so we can continue to get the word out about Evolution Glass.Your GiftsWe're so grateful for any contribution you can make! In exchange we're offering the following perks. Every donor of at least $5 will have their name included on the donors list on our website.Our teamBill has been working to perfect the reuse of recycled glass for surfaces for over 10 years and has been creating glass art since 2000.  Heather came to the project with a marketing and business analyst background excited about the potential to shift global perception about recycled glass. Together they’re excited to launch this campaign in hopes of growing Evolution Glass. A successful campaign means they can reclaim more recycled glass and bring stunning glass surface centerpieces to more homes, offices, restaurants and schools around the world.Why glass?The environmental impact of mining and refining stone surfaces like marble and granite is catastrophic. Wooden counter tops, unless they’re from reclaimed wood, mean more carbon for us to breathe and less oxygen to go around. What about those particleboard and laminate counters? What is that even made from? What chemicals are leaching into the air in our homes from that stuff? The lifecycle of glass is infinite and it's readily available and just waiting to be transformed. Evolution Glass countertops and tables are the most sustainable countertop option out there.What about the energy use and materials to create these surfaces?We use 50% less energy to create these surfaces than it would take to make a new glass countertop surface. We’re one of only four companies in the world making solid glass surfaces from 100% recycled glass. We don’t use any epoxy, resin or other binding agents to create these surfaces so they're 100% recyclable themselves. Only glass.

<h2><strong>Short Summary</strong></h2>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been interested in arts and crafts… As a kid I was always drawing or sketching or building my own toys or costume out of belts and bed sheets.</p>
<p>It was really when I reached middle school that I became fascinated with medieval history, the allure of ancient cultures and their customs, their art and their crafts, that really inspired me to want to learn to do that myself. I started going to renaissance faires and watching documentaries, just trying to immerse myself in it as much as possible. </p>
<p>I’ve been doing leather working for about 10 years now and have had the pleasure of learning from some real artisans over the years. And recently, I’ve really started to develop my own look and style. Fashion trends always seem to come back around and now with the mainstream success of shows like Game of Thrones and Vikings, the aesthetics of these eras are really starting to become more prominent in the public eye. With Knotted Bone, I’m trying to create products with that flair, a sense of medieval inspiration. My passion is to give you a custom, handmade leather product  that you could use every day and still have a really unique piece of art that not many people in the world will have. And not only leather but incorporating other materials too like chainmaille come into play for making original pieces of jewelry and accessories, really brings the whole image together,</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make this dream a reality, we have calculated that we will need about $20,000 to cover start up costs and retail space location lease. This will cover small on-site renovations, shelving, tables, furniture, inventory supplies and materials, and some advertising.</p>
<p>We have excellent  perks for donation! You can donate as little as $5 or as much more as you want! each level of donation will receive a personal thanks shout out on all our social media sites, a bumper sticker and lots of different combinations of leather and chainmaille aparrel, custom made just for you.For example, contributors of the $250 or more amount will receive a 20.oz Drinking horn with Custom belt hanger! Contributors of $1000 or more will receive their choice of custom handmade tobacco pipe or birch tree candle holders from sister company Hovegaard Pipeworks, and much more!</p>
<p>If it so happens that we do not reach or monetary goal in the 30 days, what ever we do acrue will be used wisely and efficiently towards the same ends. just know that every little bit helps and is greatly appreciated!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Bringing a new and different style and line of unique fashion wear out there for the world will help allow people to express themselves in new and bold ways, making a statement about who they are and what they love, There needs to be more of this kind of product available to the public!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any new small business, there are some risks involved. Especially when dealing with a new product that is relatively unknown to the general public. However, I believe with the right advertising and having a physical location to go to and see and feel these new goods first hand will really help to skyrocket its popularity.</p>
<p>Having been a patron and artisan in medieval festivals and the renegade fashion scene for most of my life, I have seen the call and genuine interest in cultivating such crafts into businesses where people can easily go to obtain the type of products they love.

<p>The release of the Ascent Pro marks our second crowdfunding project. We have spent the past year developing and perfecting our strategy required to accomplish this project and we are prepared for the tasks ahead. Our last project was successfully funded on Kickstarter. We are exploring our alternatives and have decided to launch the Ascent Pro on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>Challenges may include shipping deadlines, import and export as well as customer service contact being available 24/7.

</div></div>","Our internal mechanism is the Seiko NH35-A. The best possible movement in our price range for our desires. As self proclaimed horologists, this movement is unbeatable for the value it provides.Our movement was a crucial aspect in our designing process. When selecting our movement we we're in search for the following things:

Value - Had to keep our price-point under $250 (Retail)  

Depth-Resistance (Must be able to work under professional regulation divers watches requirements)  

Quality - This movement is truly a powerhouse. There are nothing but positive reviews from horology forums with regards the Seiko NH35-A.



Visual representation of the Seiko NH35-A Rotor Movement upon daily wear.

Powered by you, the Ascent Pro will never miss a minute. With daily wear our 41 hour power reserve with hand wind-able hacking will prevent this timepiece from ever missing a beat. With the quality components in the Ascent Pro there will be no adventure to big to stand in your way of wearing it.



We spent over 400 hours developing the design for the Ascent Pro. Combining elements from our favorite timepieces into a collaborative modern diver using the highest quality materials.

Using Diving Grade 316L (ISO 6425 Tested) our watches will only get better looking with age. Using a rigorous polishing technique our watches are as soft as steel can get.




Function was incredibly important and we believe we've made the best bang for buck dive watch possible in our price range. We also focused extensively on the Ascent Pro's appearance during our designing process. Implementing elements from classic watches to our favorite diver watches we have incorporated functional elements whilst remaining visually striking.

We noticed Divers weren't focusing on maintaining function whilst improving on aesthetics. It was mostly one or the other. We combined both aspects with the Ascent Pro.

Our watches were designed with cost efficiency in mind. We could have chosen more expensive components and charged a higher price but we wanted to include multiple budgets into our target demographic. Considering our components and aesthetic our prices are super competitive to the industry standards. We stand by our value and will continue to develop projects with price point in mind.

We started developing this campaign in August of 2015. After months of research and development, countless prototypes and many pots of coffee, we are now ready to bring the Ascent Pro to Indiegogo!

With our projections your Ascent Pro will arrive March 2017. This timeline may be subject to faster arrival changes if everything goes as projected.

Designing from scratch is something a lot of companies cannot say they accomplish. We have designed every component of this watch down to the bolts that hold it all together. We believe in craftsmanship and we stand by that belief with the Ascent Pro.



Using 3D software we have designed and perfected the Ascent Pro. We've undergone 5 different renditions and ultimately selected our final design on usability and it's performance whilst worn.





Black on Black - Our Recon Edition is perfect for any occasion. Brushed & Polished Black Stainless Steel give this watch a clean and sleek appearance.



Silver on Silver - Polished and Brushed our Slate Silver is our signature piece. Designed in Toronto we believe this is the perfect rendition of what a dive watch should encompass.


Gold on Gold - This is our most elegant option of the Ascent Pro. Featuring Polished Rose Gold and a Graphite Grey Bezel and face this is an eye grabber.

An anti-reflective or anti-reflection (AR) coating is a type of optical coating applied to the surface of lenses and other optical devices to reduce reflection.

This improves the efficiency of the Luminous display since less light is lost, the reduction in reflections also improves the contrast of the image by elimination of stray light. Rain or shine, your Ascent Pro will be clear.

<p>My wife and I have run a marketing agency for 20 years. Our customers have included Porsche Cars North America, Home Depot, Mizuno USA, and many others. You can visit our website <a href=""https://KarenImages.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.KarenImages.com</a> for more info.</p>
<p>In 2016 we decided we wanted to do something more meaningful than helping corporations market their brands. We wanted to market something that mattered to us, Disc Golf. The question was, who on earth would ever hire us to market Disc Golf to the world?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487006496/egzbnaz3y8t8maum8n8a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We couldn't answer that question either. So, with every marketing principle we ever learned, we developed a brand to produce and sell Disc Golf Lifestyle merchandise to help other people build free public Disc Golf Courses. After developing the brand we wrote and filmed a comedy piece about a novelty product made by the brand that many in the sport would love to have, if it could only be real. We bought an airduster for $6.99 from an auto parts store, wrapped a label on it and shot a scene for CHEENGZ Organic Tree Repellent. Then more and more jokes started coming to us, and, the impossible started seeming like it might be possible!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487007151/v4xcpwa6p3x2fxsz4wmg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The First CHEENGZ Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Redan Disc Golf Course was one of the first courses I played in 1994. When we learned they needed new signs for their tee pads we wanted to help. Our first campaign is to fund 18 new signs for the Historic Redan Disc Golf Course just outside Atlanta, GA.</p>
<p><strong>Back To The Brand</strong></p>
<p>If you have ever played disc golf you have heard the sound ""CHEENGZ"" made by the disc as it hits the chains of the target ""basket"". When you play disc golf long enough this sound begins to ring in your dreams. The logo we created represents 4 main elements of the sport:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sound of a successful throw landing in the basket ""CHEENGZ""</li>
<li>The word CHEENGZ in caps embodies the shape of a disc golf putter</li>
<li>The triangle, CHEENGZ, and stem elements combine to represent a disc golf basket</li>
<li>The double circles surrounding the logo transforms everything into a disc golf driver</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489585644/arr2e3hr0hydlcxthdvw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We believe these elements combine to create a successful Disc Golf Lifestyle brand that has the ability to build at least one public Disc Golf Course every single year. We aim to prove this brand and business model can fund the building of Disc Golf Courses across America.</p>
<p><strong>What Will We Build?</strong></p>
<p>Because we are starting only with an idea and the hope for support from people like you, our goal for 2017 is to fund the installation of one 9 hole disc golf course somewhere in the USA.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487007229/nzjmm756fawnmomfxght.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why Only a 9-hole Disc Golf Course? </strong></p>
<p>A 9-hole course is the easiest to build in terms of the amount of land needed from a park for a course footprint, as well as the capital necessary to build it. </p>
<p>And while we know 18 holes are necessary for a tournament quality course, we believe it is better to seed 9 hole courses on public property that have room for expansion to 18 or more holes. We believe if you plant a course the course will grow itself if nurtured by the community. The first course we played was a 9 hole course in Marietta, GA located within the extra green space of the baseball fields at Oregon Park. This little course had 9 baskets and 54 earthen tee pads in 1994. Today it has 36 baskets and 36 concrete tee pads that form four different courses thanks to the commitment of the amazing volunteers comprising the Cobb Disc Golf Club over the years.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487007271/bdq4fhxtxj4in11dtfoa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>By funding nine hole courses in public parks that have space for expansion to 18 holes CHEENGZ will seed twice as many disc golf courses for twice as many communities. Successful clubs will grow the course as they demonstrate the importance of Disc Golf to their own communities. </p>

<p><strong>Who Are You?</strong></p>
<p>My wife and I are relatively unknown in the world of competitive Disc Golf.  I have been playing disc sports for as long as I can remember and Karen has been by my side the entire time either playing, watching, or supporting me in competition and recreational play. From throwing disc in the street, to playing guts, ultimate, and training a champion disc dog that beat other future world champions, Disc Play has always been a part of our lives.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487005978/ygjgblqg4jbcsw1t3jp7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In 1994, after competing in our first Friskees Regional Finals in Tampa, Florida, my dog dislocated her knee and we both retired from the sport so she could heal and have a normal long life free of further injury. Missing daily disc play, I discovered disc golf and I have been addicted to the sport ever since. In fact, I am not only a long time participant, I am the founder of Disc Golfers Anonymous #00001.</p>
<p><strong>Have You Won Any PDGA Disc Golf Competitions?</strong></p>
<p>I rarely compete in Disc Golf and I consider myself a recreational player that occasionally joins a league night or a benefit tournament. After competing in Disc Dog Competitions I always enjoyed playing disc golf casually with friends, competing against myself, encouraging others to improve their game, and not take it so seriously. We believe the fellowship of the people you play with is what makes the sport so special.</p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487006245/koqd3puho1mys1waooqy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p>
<p>We love introducing new people to the sport, which is also a focus of this campaign. I love teaching beginners the beauty of a backhanded anhyser throw and its importance to their game.  This philosophy carries on in the creation of this brand.</p>
<p>CHEENGZ is not here to compete against other amazing Disc Golf brands that made it possible for us to love this sport. In fact, we hope to partner with you to grow the sport for the benefit of everyone who loves to play it. Instead of giving away your discs to beginners, we are upping the ante on ourselves to give away Disc Golf Courses so more people will buy disc golf products growing the sport for the benefit of all who love it.</p>
<p>We hope you will join us...</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are starting with a modest goal to raise capital for setting up the company, legal and accounting advice, perk production, shipping, and 18 Tee Signs for the Historic Redan Disc Golf Course. Prices for perks are set to be as affordable as possible, competitive to the market, and include fees to Indiegogo for use of their platform. We expect 60% of the proceeds to cover the production and shipping of perks. It can cost up to $4.70 to ship 1 can of tree repellent! The rest will be split between new signs for Redan, marketing expenses, and hopefully enough to legally establish CHEENGZ as a 501C3 charitable organization. Many thanks for your support!</p>

</div></div>","My wife and I have run a marketing agency for 20 years. Our customers have included Porsche Cars North America, Home Depot, Mizuno USA, and many others. You can visit our website www.KarenImages.com for more info.
In 2016 we decided we wanted to do something more meaningful than helping corporations market their brands. We wanted to market something that mattered to us, Disc Golf. The question was, who on earth would ever hire us to market Disc Golf to the world?

We couldn't answer that question either. So, with every marketing principle we ever learned, we developed a brand to produce and sell Disc Golf Lifestyle merchandise to help other people build free public Disc Golf Courses. After developing the brand we wrote and filmed a comedy piece about a novelty product made by the brand that many in the sport would love to have, if it could only be real. We bought an airduster for $6.99 from an auto parts store, wrapped a label on it and shot a scene for CHEENGZ Organic Tree Repellent. Then more and more jokes started coming to us, and, the impossible started seeming like it might be possible!

The First CHEENGZ Challenge
Redan Disc Golf Course was one of the first courses I played in 1994. When we learned they needed new signs for their tee pads we wanted to help. Our first campaign is to fund 18 new signs for the Historic Redan Disc Golf Course just outside Atlanta, GA.
Back To The Brand
If you have ever played disc golf you have heard the sound ""CHEENGZ"" made by the disc as it hits the chains of the target ""basket"". When you play disc golf long enough this sound begins to ring in your dreams. The logo we created represents 4 main elements of the sport:

The sound of a successful throw landing in the basket ""CHEENGZ""
The word CHEENGZ in caps embodies the shape of a disc golf putter
The triangle, CHEENGZ, and stem elements combine to represent a disc golf basket
The double circles surrounding the logo transforms everything into a disc golf driver


We believe these elements combine to create a successful Disc Golf Lifestyle brand that has the ability to build at least one public Disc Golf Course every single year. We aim to prove this brand and business model can fund the building of Disc Golf Courses across America.
What Will We Build?
Because we are starting only with an idea and the hope for support from people like you, our goal for 2017 is to fund the installation of one 9 hole disc golf course somewhere in the USA.

Why Only a 9-hole Disc Golf Course? 
A 9-hole course is the easiest to build in terms of the amount of land needed from a park for a course footprint, as well as the capital necessary to build it. 
And while we know 18 holes are necessary for a tournament quality course, we believe it is better to seed 9 hole courses on public property that have room for expansion to 18 or more holes. We believe if you plant a course the course will grow itself if nurtured by the community. The first course we played was a 9 hole course in Marietta, GA located within the extra green space of the baseball fields at Oregon Park. This little course had 9 baskets and 54 earthen tee pads in 1994. Today it has 36 baskets and 36 concrete tee pads that form four different courses thanks to the commitment of the amazing volunteers comprising the Cobb Disc Golf Club over the years.

By funding nine hole courses in public parks that have space for expansion to 18 holes CHEENGZ will seed twice as many disc golf courses for twice as many communities. Successful clubs will grow the course as they demonstrate the importance of Disc Golf to their own communities. 

Where Will You Build Courses?
That is up to you, and this decision has nothing to do with Indiegogo or this campaign. Our mission is to provide grants to build 9 Hole Disc Golf Courses. You can learn more about this at our website http://www.CHEENGZ.com

Who Are You?
My wife and I are relatively unknown in the world of competitive Disc Golf.  I have been playing disc sports for as long as I can remember and Karen has been by my side the entire time either playing, watching, or supporting me in competition and recreational play. From throwing disc in the street, to playing guts, ultimate, and training a champion disc dog that beat other future world champions, Disc Play has always been a part of our lives.

In 1994, after competing in our first Friskees Regional Finals in Tampa, Florida, my dog dislocated her knee and we both retired from the sport so she could heal and have a normal long life free of further injury. Missing daily disc play, I discovered disc golf and I have been addicted to the sport ever since. In fact, I am not only a long time participant, I am the founder of Disc Golfers Anonymous #00001.
Have You Won Any PDGA Disc Golf Competitions?
I rarely compete in Disc Golf and I consider myself a recreational player that occasionally joins a league night or a benefit tournament. After competing in Disc Dog Competitions I always enjoyed playing disc golf casually with friends, competing against myself, encouraging others to improve their game, and not take it so seriously. We believe the fellowship of the people you play with is what makes the sport so special.

We love introducing new people to the sport, which is also a focus of this campaign. I love teaching beginners the beauty of a backhanded anhyser throw and its importance to their game.  This philosophy carries on in the creation of this brand.
CHEENGZ is not here to compete against other amazing Disc Golf brands that made it possible for us to love this sport. In fact, we hope to partner with you to grow the sport for the benefit of everyone who loves to play it. Instead of giving away your discs to beginners, we are upping the ante on ourselves to give away Disc Golf Courses so more people will buy disc golf products growing the sport for the benefit of all who love it.
We hope you will join us...
CHEENGZ!


What We Need & What You Get
We are starting with a modest goal to raise capital for setting up the company, legal and accounting advice, perk production, shipping, and 18 Tee Signs for the Historic Redan Disc Golf Course. Prices for perks are set to be as affordable as possible, competitive to the market, and include fees to Indiegogo for use of their platform. We expect 60% of the proceeds to cover the production and shipping of perks. It can cost up to $4.70 to ship 1 can of tree repellent! The rest will be split between new signs for Redan, marketing expenses, and hopefully enough to legally establish CHEENGZ as a 501C3 charitable organization. Many thanks for your support!

Risks & ChallengesThe main risks we face are in the arena of creating products that people in the sport will enjoy having, pricing them competitively while earning additional revenue that will allow us to provide grants to communities for the installation of courses. Our initial goal of $10,000 will provide great insight into how we operate going forward.

I don't want this to happen to anybody! Then I read how 500,000 kids are reported missing in North America each year!  That number really scared me!!  That's why I created the Jabber smartwatch with safety in mind first! Not only that, we've also made in such a way that kids and parents with #Autism can also benefit from it. How? The JABBER smartwatch has both voice & Messaging capabilities. Parents can talk to their kids and they can respond via pre-defined Emojis. This keeps kids in communication with their parents. Being a parent is hard but, kids with #Autism don't need to be left out. The Jabber, a GPS Walkie Talkie smartwatch for kids that allows you to identify your child's exact location whenever they wonder off or go missing. It comes equipped with a GPS locator, safe-zone perimeter fencing, two-way walkie talkie communication capabilities and a SOS alert button for emergencies. The Jabber can be easily integrated with your smartphone (Apple or Android) with The Jabber App.With this new smart technology, you can stop worrying and never panic again when your child moves out of view!Features: GPS TrackingWe use state of the art icloud technology with GSM 4G GPS tracking. As self-described communication technology geeks, this is our top priority. Know where your child is from 16 feet and beyond at all times! GEO Safe ZoneYou set your child’s boundaries with perimeter setting, whether it’s the sandbox, or an entire shopping mall. You’ll get an instant alert when they leave the area, but they’re free to play without you hovering over their shoulder.SOS Alert ButtonIf an emergency happens, like your child falls in the playground and needs your help, they can press the SOS emergency button and start helping them from wherever you are and know where to look for them!. Get there before anyone else! Two-Way Walkie Talkie Capabilities Instantly talk to your child from your cell phone for as long as you want! Hear your child’s voice the second they ring you and get the instant peace of mind you need when they’re out of your sight.Kids’ friends and siblings also have unlimited instant walkie-talkie conversation ability with each other! They can chat on the playground to each other (how fun is that?), and check in with parents, grandparents or babysitters all at once! MessagingKids can receive instant messages from their parents and reply right away via cool emojis to check in with their status.Additional Features Include:Contact List Parents can manage the contact list of the watch directly from the smart watch. School ZoneIf kids are in school, parents can set the Jabber watch to silent and only allow SOS calls.

<p></p>
<p></p>
</li> <li>This new collection of watches is designed for distribution through retail and online stores. There are about 50 variations of case, face and strap and there should be something to appeal to everyone in some way. Even your children and younger kids will find that I have also thought of them, along with some help from my 4 year son Louis. Many of the designs compliment the existing alarm and wall clocks in my collection and I would encourage retailers and distributors to consider carrying both collections.</li>

<p>With 5 distinct and unique case designs the realization of
this new watch collection will be a huge step for my business as it
will add a whole new dimension to what we are able to offer alongside our
already established collection of Clocks. 
With the Pro series 6S20, 4 beats
per second movement and the 165 feet water resistance of the case, the Chronograph
series offers a superbly well specified watch and like all the collection, the attention
to detail and quality have been the top priority.

<p>The main challenge up to now has been in the design, which has now been
completed successfully and I am delighted by the full collection and the
quality we have achieved. We are working in collaboration with a great watch factory
and their technicians have helped us resolve all the technical and production
issues and I want to say a big thank you to Eddie, Billy and Key for all their
professional help and advice. I know that they will help us make a product that
is worthy of your support and our Brand. As you see from the samples in the
gallery section here, they look great! So please take a good look at this
collection and find something you would love to own or give away and help us
reach our goal.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If you want to help in another way, then please tell your friends about what
we are doing and if you know of a cool retail design store in your
own town, go in and grab their details and email them to us ! <a href=""mailto:info@oliverhemming.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>info@oliverhemming.com</u></a></p>

Over the years I have designed and made many different products and I am passionate about bringing affordable well designed and high quality products to the market.


 This new collection of watches is designed for distribution through retail and online stores. There are about 50 variations of case, face and strap and there should be something to appeal to everyone in some way. Even your children and younger kids will find that I have also thought of them, along with some help from my 4 year son Louis. Many of the designs compliment the existing alarm and wall clocks in my collection and I would encourage retailers and distributors to consider carrying both collections.
     

                         Retail window display for 12 watches and 4-5 desire alarm clocks





With 5 distinct and unique case designs the realization of
this new watch collection will be a huge step for my business as it
will add a whole new dimension to what we are able to offer alongside our
already established collection of Clocks. 
With the Pro series 6S20, 4 beats
per second movement and the 165 feet water resistance of the case, the Chronograph
series offers a superbly well specified watch and like all the collection, the attention
to detail and quality have been the top priority.











With the successful funding of this campaign we can
     gear up for a production run of about 3000 pieces and have some spare resources
     left over for marketing. The product development and design is already done
     and the products you see in the video  presentation and in the gallery
section here 
are full production
     samples. So please find something you would love to own or give away and
     help us do what we love to do.


What
We Need & What You Get
We are asking for funding of $40,000, of a total budget requirement of $75,000.

$60,000 for the production


     including the packaging and in store displays. We have already committed a substantial investment into the
     design and the making of the working samples .
$15,000 will be used for the first phase of the
     marketing which will principally be showing and exhibiting the collection
     to customers, some of whom we already know and are working with.
The perk for you, is to be able to save up to $115 and be one of the first owners of
     this exciting new collection and be a generous supporter of “good design” that
     is at the heartbeat of style today.



If you chose a perk that is a voucher then you have a
     wonderful choice of alarm and wall clocks, barometers and weather stations
     and the wonderful SpiceBoy pepper mill to choose from on our website www.oliverhemming.com  and these can all be in your hands
     within a few weeks of your pledge.


If we are partially funded we will continue with the
     collection but will scale back the production volume.


Here are some more images of the main perks.

<p>Inspired by summers spent in the Ozark Mountains, we found a
need for a more convenient pair of sunglasses. After losing countless pairs to
the bottom of the lake, we thought of the perfect solution. We
need to find an affordable pair of sunglasses that can withstand time spent on the
water, and at the end of the day, not end up at the bottom. After searching and comparing products, we decided on  natural bamboo sunglasses. </p>
<p>All of our sunglasses are handmade from natural woods, built sturdy and lightweight. Held together by stainless steel hinges they are designed to keep their shape. Did we mention that they float?! You will never have to worry about another pair of your favorite shades sinking to the bottom of the water. </p>
<p>We want you to worry less about what you are wearing and more about enjoying the moment.</p>

Instaguapa is a Web Magazine created two years ago, having an incredibly positive acceptance in social networks. Currently we have 116,000 followers in Instagram, from different countries all over the world (www.instaguapa.com).
Everyday we have followers asking us to sell the outfits we publish, and for that reason, even though is scary, we decided to make our dream happen by building our own clothe brand ""THE GUAPA""____
¿Que es Instaguapa?
Instaguapa es una Revista Virtual que nació hace dos años y ha tenido una increíble aceptación en las redes sociales. Actualmente contamos con una comunidad de  116.000 seguidores en la red social Instagram, proveniente de diversos países del Mundo, así como con nuestra página web (www.instaguapa.com).

Nuestros propios seguidores diariamente nos piden que vendamos todas las combinaciones que publicamos, razón por la cual, luego de dos años y llenas de dudas, miedos, sueños y trabajo, hemos decidido construir nuestra Marca de Ropa ¨THE GUAPA¨








THE GUAPA 


All proceeds will be used to the clothe's manufacture and commercialization, which will be sold worldwide online.  Our goals with this new brand are:



Make clothe for all type of women's different body shapes.
Teach our customers how to combine and wear our clothe through the outfits elaborated and published by us.
We know how difficult it is to start your own business, so part of our goal is to collaborate and help future entrepreneurs build their businesses through proceeds obtained from the sell of our clothe.


Our campaign's collaborator will be involved from the beginning of the proyect until business starts. Instagram 












THE GUAPA 

Los fondos recaudados, serán destinados a la fabricación y comercializacion de la ropa, que será vendida inicialmente online a nivel Mundial. Con esta marca tenemos varios propósitos, entre los más importantes están: 



Hacer ropa para todo tipo de cuerpo, reforzando una línea para las mujeres petit. 


Enseñar al consumidor como usar la ropa que va a comprar a través de nuestras combinaciones. 

Colaborar con futuros emprendedores en la realización de sus proyectos, mediantes fondos recaudados por la venta en la plataforma web de nuestros productos. 

El colaborador de esta campaña tendrá acceso directo a los avances de la marca a través de nuestras redes sociales, van a estar involucrados desde el inicio hasta la puesta en marcha del negocio. Instagram









¿Why is this proyect so important to us?

Because we finally found our true passion, what really inspire us, what gets us out of bed with excitement every morning to work in what we really love, and because we know all this hard work will be paid off.
We want to show the world that dreams can come true, that if you really put your heart and mind into something ,  all those times you failed and fell down were only experiences that had to happen in order to understand that what matters is that we have to believe in ourselves and pursue our dreams.

Please remember to share this campaign, leave your comment and to dress your dreams into reality...

</div></div>","iMbrief is the hippest briefcase in
the world. It’s truly one-of-a-kind. Offering more than just security and
functionality, iMbrief is also an object of art and a fashion statement in its
own right. 
We’ve all been dazzled by those cool briefcases in spy films. But you never see them in the real world. So we came
up with this idea to build a flashy briefcase packed with all the
indispensable technologies required by today’s professional road warriors.
Fashion,
security and versatility are what they demand in a mobile office. And it’s all
here. Technology merged with a timeless slick style.








Mobile. Versatile. Stylish. 
As technologies get smarter, more become possible. This is what inspires us at Magicubie –
to create products that empower you through devices that do more. We aim to
create delightful products with your own style.
iMbrief is designed to solve a wide range of challenges that road warriors face, such as accessing a reliable power supply and keeping personal items secure. Reliable and smart, tailor-made to be the most secure briefcase in the world.










  Secure







Lock: Fingerprint access / Wireless lock / Kensington lock

For your peace of mind, iMbrief is
protected by: 1) a state-of-the-art fingerprint access system; or 2) you can
use your mobile device to control access through a secure connection. Only you
have authorized access to your iMbrief. It will lock itself once the connection
with your mobile device is unexpectedly severed. Using the iMbrief app, you’re
always in control. In addition, your iMbrief is equipped with a Kensington Lock
slot so valuable contents are protected while your iMbrief is securely tied to a post.
Any unauthorized attempt at opening
the iMbrief will be greeted with a loud audible warning. In the off-chance that
someone should attempt to take your iMbrief by force, the built-in speaker can
emit a loud wail to scare off the perpetrator. When not acting as a siren, the
wireless speaker will play your preferred tune at your command.




Siren: Alarm / Auto-lock on unplanned disconnection









GPS: Path / Location tracking

If you misplace your iMbrief, the
built-in GPS ensures that it can be tracked down easily. The GPS also keeps a
log of its tracks so you can quickly retrace your trip. 



  Smart







Internal and external charge access

iMbrief is your power source
on the go.  Keep your mobile phones and tablets
functioning into the wee hours even when you’re away from an electric socket.
The two discrete USB connectors tether your devices to iMbrief’s built-in
battery. Or your devices can stay snuggly inside iMbrief, charging through
either of the two internal USB connectors. 





  


Battery (optional second)



What’s more, an optional battery
pack will power your laptop. Road warriors will never be crippled again by
running out of juice.







Wireless storage

Use iMbrief for storage when you’ve
run out of space in your devices. You can securely store, access, and share your digital information
wirelessly through a built-in data storage facility. The setup is easy, storage
is secure and the convenience it affords is priceless.







Music player / Reminder



The standard-issue built-in Bluetooth
speaker alerts you to calendar reminders and also plays your favorite tunes at
your whim. Simply set up these functions with the iMbrief app.


Internal lighting with light sensor


LEDs inside the briefcase light up
the interior – so no more playing hide-and-seek when you’re trying to find things
in the dark.




We speak both iOS and Android.



Keep control of your iMbrief with
the iOS and Android app.





  Elegance


iMbrief exudes pure elegance. Its clean lines, no-nonsense svelte shape and bright
colors give it an inviting tactile sensation. The hidden handle, out-of-sight
shoulder strap rings, anti-theft lock slot, and ample internal space all
exemplify the Magicubie team’s attention to detail in crafting this object of
art and a fashion statement. 











  Color


  Interior


















As a token of our appreciation for your support, we've knocked off a huge 40%
from the sticker price so you’ll be paying only $359 instead of $599. What’s
more, a fashionable and versatile iMbrief tote bag, which can be used both as an
iMbrief cover and a stand-alone bag, is included for orders placed on
Indiegogo.

In addition, the following personalized trims are available to go with your unique iMbrief.
Add $30 for an iMbrief badge engraved with your name.
With $300 extra, you get a custom hand-made internal layout mold per your specification.




For $9,999, a leather iMbrief in
your chosen color with name badge and custom internal velvet felt mold to
protect your valuables will be manufactured specifically for you.
In addition, a three-day visit to
meet the Magicubie team in Taiwan will be arranged. The trip is designed to
help you understand first-hand the design and manufacturing environment in
Taiwan. We’ll throw in a two-day sightseeing package to make the trip a
fantastic once-in-a-lifetime experience!

















Everyone we’ve spoken to has been super-excited and can’t wait to get their hands on the iMbrief. We feel greatly humbled and inspired. To show our appreciation for helping us bring iMbrief to the world, the Magicubie team will enhance your iMbrief even further with the following items:
* A Magicubie Tag
* A Kensington Lock
* 16GB or 32GB SD
card


They will come to you per the scheme below. Each number in the table represents a milestone of funds raised. Once the milestone is reached, all customers will receive the extra items listed accordingly. So help us to get there by spreading the word about iMbrief so we can bring this amazing briefcase to life and delight even more people everywhere!


   




















Magicubie will continue to update its apps to support the latest and hottest devices on the market.

<li>Simply cut an onion into half with a knife and chop of the two ends with shoot and stem, and then place it in the semi-circular groove of the Rouncer base unit, attach the round onion blade on the top blade slot of the unit (pick one out of the 14 depending on your requirement).</li>
<li>Use the top base unit handle to hand press the blade through the onion in the bottom base unit. This will force the onion through the blades.</li>
<li>The onion will not completely go through and collect in the top compartment, about 2mm of the onion skin will stay below the blade which ensures that the scaly leaf does not get cut and go through the blades.</li>
<li>Remove the scaly leaf before adding the next onion to cut up. </li>
<li>Lift up the top handle of the device, simply peel off the scaly skin on top of the blade.</li>
<li>Put the lid down and turn the device upside down to shake and allow any vegetables stuck between blades to fall through. Use the platform filler tool which also acts as a dicing/slicing clearing tool to clean blades of cuttings which are stuck in between.</li>
<li>To use any of the flat cutting blades, insert the blade, but place the semi-circular plastic space filler in the bottom base unit groove to cover the onion slot and make the surface flat. You can then use the device in the same way as above.</li>
<li>To use the disc blades, insert part to the blade slot and then turn the device upside down with the lid open and away from the base, rotating to the opposite direction. To use the disc blades, you simply slide to mandoline cut, grate, wavy slice and more on the underside of the top lid handle cover rather which is now exposed to the top. Please refer to images for more guidance.</li>

<p>It will be constructed of the finest materials and created with <b>precision quality</b>. There will also be a <b>money-back guarantee</b> against defects or cancellation.</p>
<p>Home and kitchen products have become very popular with consumers looking for new cool and useful products to add to their kitchen gadget list. The Rouncer will become a must have tool for every kitchen just as a knife would be, the ability to save you time and stop tears has been very well accepted by reviewers. </p>
<p>Get perfectly sized and square cut diced onions every time! Slices are of the same thickness every time you chop onions! No more health and safety concerns whilst cutting onions, this is a common knife cut in the kitchen that you can do without, and now with the Rouncer, you can chop away safely.</p>

<p><b>What We Need, and Why</b></p>
<p>Newtonstein – that’s the name of our start-up company – has already spent over $18,000 of our own funds in the development of this project, which has enabled us to create a variety of prototypes, apply for our patent, pay for legal fees, set up of logistics and choose a packing operation in Europe just like all our invention approaches.</p>
<p>We <b>require $2,000</b> to which will enable us to release a third colour option in RED, if we achieve this goal, at the end instead of 2 colour options, you will be able to pick 3 options. We have secured funding for 100% of the production order now. This is where you come in and get to grab the opportunity of becoming one of the first backers to put your hands on one at a discounted price of $40 instead of store retail price of $60! We are not setting any limits, because the more we get funded, the more we can spend on <b>new variations and trade shows</b> to establish this product in global markets whilst putting a team in place to drive its growth through <b>retail distribution </b>in other countries like India because they cook with onions everyday<b>!</b></p>
<p>All quotations for tooling and manufacturing ready, we got our final prototypes made by the same factory to ensure they are familiar with the product long term.</p>
<p>Funding from our friends at Indiegogo is essential to launch the Rouncer properly. Help us bring this amazing invention to life and revolutionise onion cutting in the kitchen!</p>
<p>The entire process of crowd funding will inevitably help us learn a great deal more about our market, <b>our product and our direction</b> for the future because your <b>critical appraisal</b> and <b>feedback </b>will help us perfect our invention, after all, it is you that will make use of it the most!</p>

<p><b>Retail Distribution:</b></p>
<p>We have signed agreements with Davison Product Group in the US, we have a verbal agreement with YCE catering distribution company in the UK, and we are in discussions various other marketing groups in the Gulf and Europe to bring Rouncer to stores this Summer.</p>
<p><b>The Journey</b></p>
<p>We came up with sketches <b>Prototype 1</b> of the Rouncer, and started looking at perfecting the design last month, reducing costs as three different blades would require three different housing blade drums and moulds. By creating a clever grooved blade housing, we managed to build this product with only one tool that allows us to interchange its assembly. Our aim was to enter the market long term in the $20 - $30 price range.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/003/046/152/39cb0e643477a1f0b1782cb8cd2105b4_large.jpg?1418577042"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p>
<p> Our revisions produced <b>Prototype 2</b> which was cool, sleek and trendy. 3D printed using our very own Form Labs 1+ Printer. Once we got this in our hands we collectively agreed that it would need to be sleek and stackable.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/003/140/932/82b7df25b2b44551ae2c14bb14b67020_large.jpg?1421265135"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p>
<p>Finally we came up with <b>Prototype 3</b> as shown on all our images which put forward our vision for this product perfectly. We modified the blade housing to require a single moulding tool, the product evolved to a multi functional blade tool giving customers more value for their money!</p>

When inserted in the Rouncer base device’s semi-circular groove and the handle is pressed down, the food cuttings clears the blades and collects in the small container thanks to the clearing tool and its spikes. 3)	 Disc blade hand guard. When using the disc blades for its mandolin functions in slicing, wavy cutting and even for grating, the hand guard allows you to latch on to the top of the vegetable or block of cheese as you get closer to the blades in order to avoid any finger cuts.  How to use the Rouncer:Take a look at our video for an easy guide on what our patented Rouncer will do for you!
Simply cut an onion into half with a knife and chop of the two ends with shoot and stem, and then place it in the semi-circular groove of the Rouncer base unit, attach the round onion blade on the top blade slot of the unit (pick one out of the 14 depending on your requirement).
Use the top base unit handle to hand press the blade through the onion in the bottom base unit. This will force the onion through the blades.
The onion will not completely go through and collect in the top compartment, about 2mm of the onion skin will stay below the blade which ensures that the scaly leaf does not get cut and go through the blades.
Remove the scaly leaf before adding the next onion to cut up. 
Lift up the top handle of the device, simply peel off the scaly skin on top of the blade.
Put the lid down and turn the device upside down to shake and allow any vegetables stuck between blades to fall through. Use the platform filler tool which also acts as a dicing/slicing clearing tool to clean blades of cuttings which are stuck in between.
To use any of the flat cutting blades, insert the blade, but place the semi-circular plastic space filler in the bottom base unit groove to cover the onion slot and make the surface flat. You can then use the device in the same way as above.
To use the disc blades, insert part to the blade slot and then turn the device upside down with the lid open and away from the base, rotating to the opposite direction. To use the disc blades, you simply slide to mandoline cut, grate, wavy slice and more on the underside of the top lid handle cover rather which is now exposed to the top. Please refer to images for more guidance.

 

 
The Rouncer Family
Rouncer comes designed in 2 cool colours! The ""Autumn Lemon"" and ""The Old Grey"".

 
We sprayed the prototypes with acrylic resin and took professional studio images to show and develop our concept, The final production results will resemble the two variations types above.
Rouncer – Form, Function and High Quality
We have designed the Rouncer with quality in mind, a uniquely designed product like nothing else available in the market, a real problem solver and one we believe that will make the world a better place!
It will be constructed of the finest materials and created with precision quality. There will also be a money-back guarantee against defects or cancellation.
Home and kitchen products have become very popular with consumers looking for new cool and useful products to add to their kitchen gadget list. The Rouncer will become a must have tool for every kitchen just as a knife would be, the ability to save you time and stop tears has been very well accepted by reviewers. 
Get perfectly sized and square cut diced onions every time! Slices are of the same thickness every time you chop onions! No more health and safety concerns whilst cutting onions, this is a common knife cut in the kitchen that you can do without, and now with the Rouncer, you can chop away safely.
We have secured retail distribution in the USA and the UK if we successfully manage to mass produce this product. Production planning has already began.

 
In the News:


Our initial prototype V1 made the news because of what it represented, the idea that could become part of everyone's life through their kitchen!
http://www.cateringinsight.com/16150-onion-slicer-maker-looking-for-investors/
What can you do with the Rouncer:
Comes with 14 Multifunctional blades included in the Rouncer including:  The Spiral Julienne strips cutter, Apple coring, Peeler, Grater, Mandoline slicer, Herb chopper, square cutter, pie cutter, rectangular cutter, wavy slicer.
Here are some meals we prepared, with the vegetables and fruits only cut using Rouncer.

 
What We Need, and Why
Newtonstein – that’s the name of our start-up company – has already spent over $18,000 of our own funds in the development of this project, which has enabled us to create a variety of prototypes, apply for our patent, pay for legal fees, set up of logistics and choose a packing operation in Europe just like all our invention approaches.
We require $2,000 to which will enable us to release a third colour option in RED, if we achieve this goal, at the end instead of 2 colour options, you will be able to pick 3 options. We have secured funding for 100% of the production order now. This is where you come in and get to grab the opportunity of becoming one of the first backers to put your hands on one at a discounted price of $40 instead of store retail price of $60! We are not setting any limits, because the more we get funded, the more we can spend on new variations and trade shows to establish this product in global markets whilst putting a team in place to drive its growth through retail distribution in other countries like India because they cook with onions everyday!
All quotations for tooling and manufacturing ready, we got our final prototypes made by the same factory to ensure they are familiar with the product long term.
Funding from our friends at Indiegogo is essential to launch the Rouncer properly. Help us bring this amazing invention to life and revolutionise onion cutting in the kitchen!
The entire process of crowd funding will inevitably help us learn a great deal more about our market, our product and our direction for the future because your critical appraisal and feedback will help us perfect our invention, after all, it is you that will make use of it the most!

 
Retail Distribution:
We have signed agreements with Davison Product Group in the US, we have a verbal agreement with YCE catering distribution company in the UK, and we are in discussions various other marketing groups in the Gulf and Europe to bring Rouncer to stores this Summer.
The Journey
We came up with sketches Prototype 1 of the Rouncer, and started looking at perfecting the design last month, reducing costs as three different blades would require three different housing blade drums and moulds. By creating a clever grooved blade housing, we managed to build this product with only one tool that allows us to interchange its assembly. Our aim was to enter the market long term in the $20 - $30 price range.

 
 Our revisions produced Prototype 2 which was cool, sleek and trendy. 3D printed using our very own Form Labs 1+ Printer. Once we got this in our hands we collectively agreed that it would need to be sleek and stackable.

 
Finally we came up with Prototype 3 as shown on all our images which put forward our vision for this product perfectly. We modified the blade housing to require a single moulding tool, the product evolved to a multi functional blade tool giving customers more value for their money!

<p>Pepper's Closet is a Benefit Corporation!</p>
<p>Last year, a marine biologist dad and a ladyboss mom created Pepper’s Closet as a way to share their love of the ocean with their baby Pepper. The goal of their custom branded clothing line was simple: become aware by what we wear. Soon, the PC team grew to include people from all walks of life who shared a common love of the sea: visionaries, activists, parents and beach bums alike. Together we’re reimaging possibilities, inspiring new outcomes and challenging others to live an ocean positive life.</p>
<p>We hope to encourage others to get involved and recognize that every small effort helps our planet’s future, even something as simple as the clothes we wear. Our custom crafted apparel features hand-drawn designs that creatively reflect the ocean, and we pair each piece of clothing with an informational tag meant to engage and educate. <strong>We donate 10% of all net profits directly to ocean conservation, </strong><strong>research</strong><strong> and cleanup efforts. </strong>We’re devoted to protecting not just our planet’s big blue heart, but ourselves, our children, our communities and generations to come. <strong>Our goal is to create a movement that is as limitless and unstoppable as the ocean itself. Together, we can preserve and protect one of Earth’s greatest miracles.</strong></p>
<p>We’re tirelessly championing for our planet’s greatest source of sustenance as it combats severely threatening forces. This is a movement beyond this moment. It’s a tale that never ends. Young and old, large and small…we all inherently share this common thread.   </p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Where does your money go?</strong></p>
<p>Your money is going to help us increase capacity so we can expand our impact. The more money we raise, the more we are able to produce. We would like to bring production in house so we can support our local economy, employ local artists, local scientists, and local ocean lovers. The stronger we are, the stronger our presences and impact can be. We look to you to help us get there. We aim to be as transparent as possible in our efforts as they are entirely genuine. This is the seed money we need to get moving in a larger way.</p>
<p><strong>Can you ship to different countries?</strong></p>
<p>Yes we can! The ocean is global and so are we. Just an extra tax added.</p>
<p><strong>When can I select my color?</strong></p>
<p>We'll send out a survey shortly after the campaign ends where we'll ask you for your color choice and design.</p>
<p><strong>What next?</strong></p>
<p>We plan to ramp up production and bring on new team members with the funds from this campaign. After that, we begin to expand our apparel line and would like to expand to ocean positive lifestyle clothing for all the people we hope to engage in our work: parents, kids, scientists, and beach bums. We hope to create a line of activewear to support you as you live your ocean positive life!</p>
<p>We are also going to begin building partnerships with organizations focused on ocean education, advocacy, and awareness as the educational component of our work is essential to building a movement and empowering the next generation of ocean stewards. As we build these partnerships we plan to travel and welcome everyone to follow us in our journey! We want to explore the wonders of this #bigblueplant and bring the voices of the ocean to the forefront</p>
<p><strong>Why is there a range in funding?</strong></p>
<p>We want to offer everyone an opportunity to get involved. We believe that transparency is essential because Pepper’s Closet is for the people by the people, we are in this work because we believe in a common goal, and we know you do too. We all have different circumstances and that shouldn’t determine your ability to make your voice heard. We welcome everyone from all walks of life, shapes and sizes, ages and backgrounds to join the movement. We provided tangible reasons for the range in funding so you know exactly how much we need and the incredible impact your donations have. Once again, we are only as powerful as those who walk beside us.</p>

Where does your money go?
Your money is going to help us increase capacity so we can expand our impact. The more money we raise, the more we are able to produce. We would like to bring production in house so we can support our local economy, employ local artists, local scientists, and local ocean lovers. The stronger we are, the stronger our presences and impact can be. We look to you to help us get there. We aim to be as transparent as possible in our efforts as they are entirely genuine. This is the seed money we need to get moving in a larger way.
Can you ship to different countries?
Yes we can! The ocean is global and so are we. Just an extra tax added.
When can I select my color?
We'll send out a survey shortly after the campaign ends where we'll ask you for your color choice and design.
What next?
We plan to ramp up production and bring on new team members with the funds from this campaign. After that, we begin to expand our apparel line and would like to expand to ocean positive lifestyle clothing for all the people we hope to engage in our work: parents, kids, scientists, and beach bums. We hope to create a line of activewear to support you as you live your ocean positive life!
We are also going to begin building partnerships with organizations focused on ocean education, advocacy, and awareness as the educational component of our work is essential to building a movement and empowering the next generation of ocean stewards. As we build these partnerships we plan to travel and welcome everyone to follow us in our journey! We want to explore the wonders of this #bigblueplant and bring the voices of the ocean to the forefront
Why is there a range in funding?
We want to offer everyone an opportunity to get involved. We believe that transparency is essential because Pepper’s Closet is for the people by the people, we are in this work because we believe in a common goal, and we know you do too. We all have different circumstances and that shouldn’t determine your ability to make your voice heard. We welcome everyone from all walks of life, shapes and sizes, ages and backgrounds to join the movement. We provided tangible reasons for the range in funding so you know exactly how much we need and the incredible impact your donations have. Once again, we are only as powerful as those who walk beside us.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hey y'all!<br/><br/>I started working on Tee &amp; Honey about three years ago. At the time it was just a hobby. Initially, turning my thoughts into art was a form of therapy.

<h2>Two new fragrances from 4160Tuesdays:</h2>
<p>We handmake perfume in West London; we're small, dedicated, enthusiastic about what we do, and a little bit bonkers* but practical and open.</p>
<p>We first crowdfunded a collection of fragrances in 2012, and each time we've needed to take a step forwards we've run a new campaign. Some of our customers have joined in every single one, for which we are more than grateful, and which probably shows that we're doing something right.</p>
<p>We're doing it again, and this time it's serious.</p>
<p>We're making two new fragrances, the dark and the light.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take Me To The River - inspired by the sensual Talking Heads version of Al Green's classic</li>
<li>Wash Me In The Water - a line from the same song, but the feeling of being deeply cleansed.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose both or either, and there are many other perks too. They will be very reasonably priced for handmade batches of indie scents, with a margin built in to go into the removals fund.</p>
<h3>Why we need your help:</h3>
<p>Why? Because we need to move buildings.</p>
<p>Our current building lease runs out in 2019, and that's not long when you have to move a whole small business. We've found a building by the River Thames which is so perfect we nearly cried with joy when we visited. It's slightly larger, so we'll be able to run more workshops, invite more of you over, and have a proper showroom for visitors to come and smell everything.</p>
<p>We're crowdfunding to bridge the gap between being in our current workshop, and setting up in the new one.</p>
<p>The gap where you realise that the wifi doesn't work yet, the power isn't switched on, your suppliers are still delivering your materials to the old building, you can't run your workshops because half your materials are in storage... That gap. We need to keep running smoothly while we move to the new place, and the best way we can do that is to make it happen as quickly and smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>Like we said, we're practical. We know this is going to be tricky and so we're preparing for that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why we're doing this now:</h3>
<p>We're based in London, near the new Crossrail line which will probably open next year. For that reason property prices in this little local bubble are rocketing. Next year, when our lease runs out, we don't have the right to stay. A neighbouring company just left after being offered a new lease with a 50% rent increase and a charge of £10K to renew it, so even if we wanted to, we can't afford that. We seriously considered just selling up and shutting down, then we looked at the alternatives, and decided to aim to stay in business, go somewhere else, and do it by doing what we do best: making perfume.</p>
<p>This is going to be disruptive, but not as disruptive as a 50% rent increase when you;'e as tiny as we are. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're moving! We've found a building we'd love to rent but it would all fall through and we'd need to find another, but we still need to move whatever happens. </li>
<li>Many of you already know what we do, and will trust us to do it again. If you're new to 4160Tuesdays, well you might get a surprise when you first smell our fragrances, but we really believe you will not be disappointed.</li>
<li>As always, if we don't reach our goal you will still get your fragrances, and we'll look for another place to move to in the meantime.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're not doing this to get noticed, or to get bought by the big guys (we're too left field for them anyway), we really just want to keep on doing what we're doing, but things change and we've got to step up. We're doing it because we're not ready to give it all up yet.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You'll Get:</h3>
<p>We're making two fragrances, and all our perks are based around them. </p>
<p>These will be one-off special editions for everyone who joins us here, then  they're only be available at our new building.</p>
<p><strong>1. Take Me To The River</strong></p>
<p>Our first fragrance is based on the Talking Heads live 1980s version of Take Me To The River:</p>
<p>""to capture by the feeling of an irresistible attraction to someone who's very bad for you but that you don't want to give up, not yet. If you've been there, you're probably very glad to be out of it, and maybe look back with a certain fondness but much more relief."" Sarah.</p>
<p>Do listen to the song to get the idea, but we asked our Facebook group, 4160Tuesdays News what it should smell like and we got:</p>
<p>""whiskey, cigarettes, money, 80s loud perfume, lipstick, salt water/tears, dirt, roses and leather""</p>
<p>""sex and leather and tobacco""</p>
<p>""cocoa with the birch tar, orange, sandalwood and vetiver""</p>
<p>""Oakmoss, Patchouli, Civet, Smoke, Musk""</p>
<p>""Petrol, chalk, damp wood and metal (bit like what guitars smell like) and sweet sweaty musks. Analog cameras and bakelite, rubber shoes and vintage aftershave. 80’s velvet upholstery""</p>
<p>""fag smoke, leather jackets, sticky wooden floors, face powder, lippy &amp; massive clouds of Elnett hairspray""</p>
<p>We're working on it now, but you get the general idea of the inspiration behind it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Wash Me In the Water</strong></p>
<p>""The fragrance of a soul-cleansing wildwater swim on a hot day, drying off on warm grass. A baptismal dunking in cool fresh water; a scented intervention to save you from yourself."" Sarah</p>
<p>And from our Facebook group:</p>
<p>""Grass - riverside. Climbing/wild rose, wild thyme, apple blossom, sloe and bramble berry - all growing beside our local river""</p>
<p>""Wilted wild flowers for innocence lost""</p>
<p>""Wildflowers, grass, vanilla, wood, ambergris""</p>
<p>""moss, patchouli and a hint of salvation and release""</p>
<p>""Incense and magnolia with a hint of mint julep""</p>
<p>If you'd like to come over to 4160Tuesdays News, and join in with all these wonderful people,  feel free.</p>
<h3>What happens if we reach the target?</h3>
<ul>
<li>We make and send out all the fragrances - all being well in this unpredictable world. We've always delivered everything we've promised, and barring totally unforseen natural (or unnatural) disasters we'll get these to you this side of 2019.</li>
<li>By raising all the funds in advance, we can produce bigger batches than we usually do, deliver them in a huge all-hands-to-the-pump effort, and give ourselves a couple of weeks to move ALL the kit from one building to another, </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What happens if we don't?</h3>
<ul>
<li>We still make and send out ALL your fragrances.</li>
<li>We might not be able to move into the new building, but we'll have a few months to come up with plan B.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe you don't wear perfume; maybe these two don't sound quite your cup of tea, but if you know some fragrance fans, please let them know what we're up to.</p>
<p>Please share this campaign on your Facebook page or your Twitter feed, and tell your friends.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h3>My Who What and Why</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Marcel, owner of Elements Of Style, LLC and creator of the Bona Fide New Yorker brand and the NYC Wear and Gear line of gift items, garments and accessories.</p>
<p>Since creating my line, I've been seeking companies willing and able to supply me with premium athleisure apparel at prices that would enable me to provide performing artists, dancers, coaches, fitness enthusiasts, athletes, active lifestyle individuals, etc., with performance wear that provides unparalleled value.</p>
<p>Said value to be achieved by collaborating with  a few select suppliers, one in particular that exploits the advantages of a finely tuned and totally vertically integrated operation that enables them to as an actual owner of fabric mills and dye houses, and therefore non reliant on others to satisfy their material related requirements, maintain complete control over everything. And I do mean EVERYTHING ... from the production speed, quality and costs of their 15 proprietary and unique Polyester and Poly-blend performance fabrics through the dying, cutting, sewing and subsequent steps efficiently executed inside their own Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP) approved and routinely monitored garment manufacturing factories.</p>
<p>The recent success of my preferred partners search resulted in the initial items of my new <strong>P</strong>ractice <strong>W</strong>ith <strong>P</strong>urpose <strong>P</strong>erform <strong>W</strong>ith <strong>P</strong>assion (PWP) Collection  featured in the campaign video.</p>
<p>However while the pieces look great unembellished, it's clear some folks prefer to sport designs on their performance wear.</p>
<p>So the goal of my crowdfunding campaign is to raise funds that I will use to have professional graphic designers create for me unique artwork that I can have my printer partners apply to various pieces or do so myself using heat transfers in combination with my trusty Heat Press.</p>
<p>Also, as one born and bred in the Boogie Down Bronx who strongly believes dancing, or even simply viewing dance, positively affects our emotions and moods, 10% of the amount raised (minus administrative fees) up to the $1,500 target will be donated to MIT<i> Mocha Moves</i> -- a hip-hop dance team that promotes and celebrates urban dance culture at my alma mater and in the Greater Boston area.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574370433/b5pbpwvbin1wtdzr1d1t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So check out the PWP Collection and if you are a dancer, support dance, love athleisure wear, or see items that are ideal for you or folks you give presents to, please back my campaign and help make my proposed funding of decorative artwork a reality by selecting a perk at the support or contribution level with which you are comfortable and then sharing word of this campaign with friends, relatives, associates and anyone else you believe will be inclined to do the same.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574374893/ikurghmim54ftqbf1ow8.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>PWP Collection Perks</h3>
<p>In exchange for your support,  you will receive the perks of your choice at discounted pricing with Free Shipping in the United States, be among the first to wear or use them, and receive advance notice regarding NYC Wear and Gear's new products ... in particular any limited edition offerings.</p>
<p>Closely allied and collaborating with FIT alumni and technologists focused on fashion related innovation, look for NYC Wear and Gear to in the future introduce products that feature wearable electronics, exploit the special attributes of high tech materials or via the use of patented technology and a facilitating process provide custom tailored level, superb fit garments that require no tailor visits.</p>
<p>Pledged money received in excess of the $1,500 goal will be used to commission additional artwork, purchase heat transfers,  enable me to invest in a 6"" x 10"" heat press platen, and fund donations to a yet to be identified New York City-based, dance related  501(c)3 tax exempt non-profit organization and The Debbie Allen Dance Academy out in Los Angeles.  </p>
<p>Detailed information about all of the Collection products, as well as others offered as perks, is provided in the product descriptions with some also residing in the Perks Selection section.</p>
<p>When Perks allow for the associated items to be provided decorated with Bonus Graphics,  supporters will select the  graphics they desire from those featured in the following collage.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574884524/kof6zeze1feiln3bb2as.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Bonus graphic designs will be <strong>D</strong>irect <strong>T</strong>o <strong>G</strong>arment printed or heat pressed in the center chest area as shown in some of the Perk images.  </p>
<p>The artwork I commission will mainly be for sublimation all over print pieces and feature much more complex, multi-colored designs similar to those often seen on Tees, hoodies &amp; leggings.</p>

</div></div>","My Who What and Why
Hi, I'm Marcel, owner of Elements Of Style, LLC and creator of the Bona Fide New Yorker brand and the NYC Wear and Gear line of gift items, garments and accessories.
Since creating my line, I've been seeking companies willing and able to supply me with premium athleisure apparel at prices that would enable me to provide performing artists, dancers, coaches, fitness enthusiasts, athletes, active lifestyle individuals, etc., with performance wear that provides unparalleled value.
Said value to be achieved by collaborating with  a few select suppliers, one in particular that exploits the advantages of a finely tuned and totally vertically integrated operation that enables them to as an actual owner of fabric mills and dye houses, and therefore non reliant on others to satisfy their material related requirements, maintain complete control over everything. And I do mean EVERYTHING ... from the production speed, quality and costs of their 15 proprietary and unique Polyester and Poly-blend performance fabrics through the dying, cutting, sewing and subsequent steps efficiently executed inside their own Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP) approved and routinely monitored garment manufacturing factories.
The recent success of my preferred partners search resulted in the initial items of my new Practice With Purpose Perform With Passion (PWP) Collection  featured in the campaign video.
However while the pieces look great unembellished, it's clear some folks prefer to sport designs on their performance wear.
So the goal of my crowdfunding campaign is to raise funds that I will use to have professional graphic designers create for me unique artwork that I can have my printer partners apply to various pieces or do so myself using heat transfers in combination with my trusty Heat Press.
Also, as one born and bred in the Boogie Down Bronx who strongly believes dancing, or even simply viewing dance, positively affects our emotions and moods, 10% of the amount raised (minus administrative fees) up to the $1,500 target will be donated to MIT Mocha Moves -- a hip-hop dance team that promotes and celebrates urban dance culture at my alma mater and in the Greater Boston area.

So check out the PWP Collection and if you are a dancer, support dance, love athleisure wear, or see items that are ideal for you or folks you give presents to, please back my campaign and help make my proposed funding of decorative artwork a reality by selecting a perk at the support or contribution level with which you are comfortable and then sharing word of this campaign with friends, relatives, associates and anyone else you believe will be inclined to do the same.


PWP Collection Perks
In exchange for your support,  you will receive the perks of your choice at discounted pricing with Free Shipping in the United States, be among the first to wear or use them, and receive advance notice regarding NYC Wear and Gear's new products ... in particular any limited edition offerings.
Closely allied and collaborating with FIT alumni and technologists focused on fashion related innovation, look for NYC Wear and Gear to in the future introduce products that feature wearable electronics, exploit the special attributes of high tech materials or via the use of patented technology and a facilitating process provide custom tailored level, superb fit garments that require no tailor visits.
Pledged money received in excess of the $1,500 goal will be used to commission additional artwork, purchase heat transfers,  enable me to invest in a 6"" x 10"" heat press platen, and fund donations to a yet to be identified New York City-based, dance related  501(c)3 tax exempt non-profit organization and The Debbie Allen Dance Academy out in Los Angeles.  
Detailed information about all of the Collection products, as well as others offered as perks, is provided in the product descriptions with some also residing in the Perks Selection section.
When Perks allow for the associated items to be provided decorated with Bonus Graphics,  supporters will select the  graphics they desire from those featured in the following collage.

The Bonus graphic designs will be Direct To Garment printed or heat pressed in the center chest area as shown in some of the Perk images.  
The artwork I commission will mainly be for sublimation all over print pieces and feature much more complex, multi-colored designs similar to those often seen on Tees, hoodies & leggings.
Examples of the latter two are the tiger face zippered hoodie and combination mandala wave pattern leggings designs shown here that were done by Martin Marz (@marzgfx_)

I, Shabnam Ahmed, know that well too.</p><p>At the same time, disposable nappies represent a huge burden for the environment - by the time our baby is potty trained, the baby could use 4,000 to 6,000 disposable nappies (Source: Wrap.co.uk).</p><p>That is why I launched Melu Monkey, inspired by my daughter, Amelia (nicknamed Melu), who is now 4 years old: to address a lot of the significant issues that parents face nowadays AND to preserve the environment.</p><p>My team at Melu Monkey and I, have the ultimate answer, the unique combination: <strong>Melu Monkey ECO-Nappies!</strong></p><p>Melu Monkey Eco-Nappies offer a seamless combination: they are <u>ultra-comfortable</u> for the baby and <u>super-friendly for the environment</u>. How?</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Ultra-Comfortable</u></strong></p><p>Our Eco nappies are predominantly made from Bamboo because of its amazing qualities and sustainability.</p><p>1) It is soft &amp; silky to the touch, yet extremely strong &amp; absorbent.</p><p>2) It is 100% biodegradable and is not polluting to the environment.</p><p>3) Bamboo grows extremely fast without the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides.</p><p>4) Bamboo has moisture-wicking &amp; thermal regulating capabilities that keep your baby’s skin dry &amp; comfortable in both hot and cold temperatures.</p><p>5) Bamboo is naturally hypoallergenic &amp; antibacterial, making it <strong>ideal for</strong> those with <strong>sensitive skin</strong>.</p><p>6) It is odour resistant.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Super-Friendly For The Environment</u></strong></p><p>As well as being friendly for the baby, we wanted to ensure that our Eco nappies are friendly to mother earth. Unlike most disposable nappies on the market, we did not want our Eco nappies to sit on the landfills for the next 500 years (like most regular disposable nappies) and destroy and harm nature. So, what did we do:</p><p>1) We made <strong><u>biodegradable</u></strong> nappies. Which means the nappy breaks down in a fraction of time compared to regular disposable nappies. In fact, once disposed of, it takes about 75 days for over 60% of our Eco nappies to degrade. </p><p>2) We ensure that the raw materials are from sustainable resources in compliance with the FSC guidelines. In fact, we are in the process of being certified by the FSC.</p><p>3) We ensure that our raw materials are ethically sourced.</p><p>4) We ensure that our labour workforce is treated with respect as far as adequate work conditions and remuneration are concerned.</p><p>5) Our nappies are wrapped in a biodegradable polybag that biodegrades within 18 months once disposed of.</p><p>6) Unlike other biodegradable nappies who only have a biodegradable filling, our nappies are over 80% biodegradable. In comparison, other leading biodegradable nappies are on average only 50% - 70% biodegradable. </p><p>7) We also make use of Total Chlorine Free (TCF) materials, meaning that the nappies have not been subjected to dangerous chemicals in any part of the manufacturing process to ensure a safe product for your babies.</p><p><u>What is TCF and What Are Its Benefits?</u></p><p>1) TCF bleaching is a part of the bleaching process that is undertaken without the use of chlorine.</p><p>2) As a result, the process has a much lower impact on the environment</p><p>3) Lowers Energy Costs</p><p>4) Provides for easy defibering and good pad integrity through the high network strength</p><p>5) Removes toxic elements from the nappies.</p><p>6) According to Pediatrics and Dermatologists, children are extremely vulnerable to Toxic exposures given their hand to mouth behaviours, floor play, and developing nervous and reproductive systems.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Doing good for your baby and for mother earth?

I, Shabnam Ahmed, know that well too.At the same time, disposable nappies represent a huge burden for the environment - by the time our baby is potty trained, the baby could use 4,000 to 6,000 disposable nappies (Source: Wrap.co.uk).That is why I launched Melu Monkey, inspired by my daughter, Amelia (nicknamed Melu), who is now 4 years old: to address a lot of the significant issues that parents face nowadays AND to preserve the environment.My team at Melu Monkey and I, have the ultimate answer, the unique combination: Melu Monkey ECO-Nappies!Melu Monkey Eco-Nappies offer a seamless combination: they are ultra-comfortable for the baby and super-friendly for the environment. How? Ultra-ComfortableOur Eco nappies are predominantly made from Bamboo because of its amazing qualities and sustainability.1) It is soft & silky to the touch, yet extremely strong & absorbent.2) It is 100% biodegradable and is not polluting to the environment.3) Bamboo grows extremely fast without the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides.4) Bamboo has moisture-wicking & thermal regulating capabilities that keep your baby’s skin dry & comfortable in both hot and cold temperatures.5) Bamboo is naturally hypoallergenic & antibacterial, making it ideal for those with sensitive skin.6) It is odour resistant. Super-Friendly For The EnvironmentAs well as being friendly for the baby, we wanted to ensure that our Eco nappies are friendly to mother earth. Unlike most disposable nappies on the market, we did not want our Eco nappies to sit on the landfills for the next 500 years (like most regular disposable nappies) and destroy and harm nature. So, what did we do:1) We made biodegradable nappies. Which means the nappy breaks down in a fraction of time compared to regular disposable nappies. In fact, once disposed of, it takes about 75 days for over 60% of our Eco nappies to degrade. 2) We ensure that the raw materials are from sustainable resources in compliance with the FSC guidelines. In fact, we are in the process of being certified by the FSC.3) We ensure that our raw materials are ethically sourced.4) We ensure that our labour workforce is treated with respect as far as adequate work conditions and remuneration are concerned.5) Our nappies are wrapped in a biodegradable polybag that biodegrades within 18 months once disposed of.6) Unlike other biodegradable nappies who only have a biodegradable filling, our nappies are over 80% biodegradable. In comparison, other leading biodegradable nappies are on average only 50% - 70% biodegradable. 7) We also make use of Total Chlorine Free (TCF) materials, meaning that the nappies have not been subjected to dangerous chemicals in any part of the manufacturing process to ensure a safe product for your babies.What is TCF and What Are Its Benefits?1) TCF bleaching is a part of the bleaching process that is undertaken without the use of chlorine.2) As a result, the process has a much lower impact on the environment3) Lowers Energy Costs4) Provides for easy defibering and good pad integrity through the high network strength5) Removes toxic elements from the nappies.6) According to Pediatrics and Dermatologists, children are extremely vulnerable to Toxic exposures given their hand to mouth behaviours, floor play, and developing nervous and reproductive systems. Doing good for your baby and for mother earth?

<p>I started selling sunglasses in a tiny store at downtown Miami in 2000. The store was as narrow as the front door! </p>
<p>A few years later, I was manufacturing  eyeglasses and sunglasses in Italy! After a while, the Italians started to manufacture sunglasses in China, and so I started to manufacture over there too.</p>
<p>In 2007, I decided to go back to my country with an eyewear distribution. Unfortunately, that was the wrong decision. A bad partnership in the eyewear distribution left me in bad shape, and I lost almost everything.</p>
<p>At that moment, I said to myself: Someday, I will turn this “Bad into a Good”. And that's what I've done after 10 years with this FIX-OO! </p>
<p>I came back to the USA in 2015, and in 2017 this great idea came to me, and with some good investments it became a patent grant in 2019.</p>
<p>But everything started in 2018, prototyping, samples molds, designing, engineers and the search for investors.</p>
<p>The product was so promising and with some real prototypes and some customer pre- approval orders, I found a partner!</p>
<p>It took me over three years of hard work and resilience to finish and deliver, nothing can stop it! We get alone, we lose about everything, we lose our minds.  But !!</p>

Risks & Challenges 

Yes, there are risks. I might be forced to move at some point and I will have to find a space to work on stone. 
A machine might break. 
I lose a finger. 
I somehow can't figure out how to sell what i've made. etc.
I should be able to overcome most challenges.

If I have to move at any point from my house with garage the plan will be to find a shared studio space to do my rather messy and loud art at.
If the machines break I know plenty of people that are good with stuff like that. Im also not half bad at repairing a number of things on my own... YOUTUBE people. YOUTUBE.

I have experience with selling my goods. I seem to do pretty good selling goods to people I know or come in contact with. I think with Etsy, and various other places on the internet and perhaps being able to get my stuff into local shops I think i'm SET as for as my plan to get my stuff sold.

<b><h3>About This Campaign</h3></b>Imagine if your workout clothes were fun and
beautiful pieces of wearable art, featuring hand painted designs by batik artists
from Southeast Asia.<br/><ul> </ul>Research has shown that having fun and beautiful active wear
inspires women to enjoy their workouts and train more often. We want to encourage more women to lead active and healthy lifestyles, so we set out on a mission to create beautiful and awe-inspiring active wear. <br/><br/>Taking influence from our Malaysian roots, we turned towards batik, a traditional and versatile textile art and created 5 beautiful, nature inspired designs to be featured on high performance leggings.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460360103/5_art_2_aw5wc4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
The designs were hand drawn using traditional batik tools, the tjanting 
and hot wax. The color is then filled in using fabric dye.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460357704/Drawing_using_the_tjanting_dkct1a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Once the artwork is complete, it is transferred onto spandex fabric via sublimation printing, so that the leggings are machine washable, the colors will never fade and the leggings will continue to display the hand painted designs for over the length of it's lifetime. <br/><br/>We believe that beautiful, high quality items can and should be
affordable and accessible to everyone. The average retail price of high
performance, printed leggings start from USD75.00 We are offering these 
leggings to you at much more affordable prices, as we want everyone to experience and enjoy
 these beautiful and awe-inspiring pieces.<br/><br/><p>Batik in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries in Southeast Asia is typically featured on formal wear, but uncommon
in the active wear domain. We wanted to take this traditional art form and give it a fun and modern twist by featuring it on trendy leggings. The goal is for <span>art form to
be embraced by new audiences around the world, some whom may be unfamiliar with it otherwise.</span><br/><span></span></p>
<span>Part of the funds raised through this campaign will go to the artists to benefit and preserve their craft. The balance will go to costs of production of these leggings, which include costs of materials and costs of workmanship. <br/><h3><br/></h3>

</div></div>","About This CampaignImagine if your workout clothes were fun and
beautiful pieces of wearable art, featuring hand painted designs by batik artists
from Southeast Asia. Research has shown that having fun and beautiful active wear
inspires women to enjoy their workouts and train more often. We want to encourage more women to lead active and healthy lifestyles, so we set out on a mission to create beautiful and awe-inspiring active wear. Taking influence from our Malaysian roots, we turned towards batik, a traditional and versatile textile art and created 5 beautiful, nature inspired designs to be featured on high performance leggings.
The designs were hand drawn using traditional batik tools, the tjanting 
and hot wax. The color is then filled in using fabric dye.

Once the artwork is complete, it is transferred onto spandex fabric via sublimation printing, so that the leggings are machine washable, the colors will never fade and the leggings will continue to display the hand painted designs for over the length of it's lifetime. We believe that beautiful, high quality items can and should be
affordable and accessible to everyone. The average retail price of high
performance, printed leggings start from USD75.00 We are offering these 
leggings to you at much more affordable prices, as we want everyone to experience and enjoy
 these beautiful and awe-inspiring pieces.Batik in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries in Southeast Asia is typically featured on formal wear, but uncommon
in the active wear domain. We wanted to take this traditional art form and give it a fun and modern twist by featuring it on trendy leggings. The goal is for art form to
be embraced by new audiences around the world, some whom may be unfamiliar with it otherwise.
Part of the funds raised through this campaign will go to the artists to benefit and preserve their craft. The balance will go to costs of production of these leggings, which include costs of materials and costs of workmanship.

Introducing Our Leggings & The Ladies They Were Named After

The Zai Leggings



Our Phoenix themed leggings are named after Zai. Zai is a beauty junky and a bendy yogi who loves beach holidays. She is featured in our shoot doing modern dance poses, which she totally nailed. A Phoenix is a bird of Greek mythology which symbolizes rebirth. It embodies the spirit of the brand, which is to keep evolving, growing and trying new things.

The Alya Leggings



Alya is a self proclaimed cat whisperer who also loves to dance. She is an 
avid practitioner of pole dancing, aerial hoops and aerial silks. She is 
featured in our shoot as our lovely and captivating aerial hoop angel.



We named our Japanese koi leggings after Alya. In Japanese, 'koi' (simply meaning 'carp') is derived from a word that
means 'affection' or 'love'; koi are therefore symbols of
love and friendship in Japan.
The Feiticeira Leggings (Right, in green)
Christine, also known as Feiticeira (meaning 'Sorceress' in Brazilian 
Portuguese) is a capoeira instructor who runs strict training sessions, 
especially with her kids class, but doing so with the best of intentions
 and love. She is the epitome of a strong, independent woman protecting 
and supporting friends and loved ones.

Our hummingbird themed 
leggings are named after Christine, nimble and fast creatures that are 
able to get through life’s obstacles
with grace and style.

The Bonnie Leggings (Left, in white)

Don't mess with Bonnie! This petite lady may look unassumingly harmless but she has years of capoeira and most recently, Brazillian jujitsu training
 under her belt. Bonnie is also a talented singer
 who participated in her first open mike session recently.




Our peacock themed leggings are named after Bonnie. Why do we think this
 is perfect? She embodies the spirit so well, as she, just like a 
peacock, is confident and beautiful, inside and outside.

The Selina Leggings (Base - bottom yogi)


Selina is a Malaysian yoga instructor, based in Singapore and part of 
the YogaMovement team. She has a serious addiction towards arm balances,
 inversion, and all things crazy which makes her energetic classes super
 fun to attend. Follow her beautiful & witty yoga journey on 
instagram @senoritayogini. 


Our dragonfly themed leggings are named after Selina. Dragonflies are powerful and agile fliers, capable of migrating
across oceans, moving in any direction, and changing direction suddenly.
 For Fit Rebel, this represents the modern women, who are strong, 
adventurous and
flexible.

<h4>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h4>
<div><br/></div>
<p>Fortunately, I am in the position where I already own the perfect 3D printer for the job, along with a healthy supply of filament in a huge range of colours. I plan to continue buying bulk sample filaments in as many colours as I can find - as I'm sure you can imagine, 10m goes a long way when printing these small parts! In terms of production, I'm not remotely concerned!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is my 2nd crowdfunded project (the other being on that popular platform with the green logo!). My first campaign ended successfully and I learned a huge amount. This is very different however, this time I have complete control over the manufacture, as well as everything else - no 3rd parties to communicate with, or be on the receiving end of their delays. In short, I cannot wait to get started producing your orders!!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Q&amp;A:</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<h4>1) How do I remove the old/snapped/damaged/boring zipper from my jacket before putting a super awesome ClipZip on there?</h4>
<p>Welllll - The best way I've found could not be easier. Simply slide the old zipper to the top (on a jacket, this is the collar end) and pull really hard! It'll pop right off into your hand, job done!</p>
<h4>2) How strong is ClipZip compared to a regular zipper?</h4>
<p>ClipZip is 3D Printed. For those unaware, this means that it's made up of lots and lots of layers. While the parts have been designed and printed in super robust, strong filaments so it will survive the everyday, they do not have the long-term resilience of injection moulded parts. This is mainly the reason why we don't have 3D printed products readily available on the high-street. Printed parts are primarily for prototyping, development and testing for fit and function - not years of abuse. With this in mind, I want you to test ClipZip on as many things as you can, let me know areas it struggles and places it excels. All of this will feedback into perfecting the design of the full-strength, mass produced final product!</p>
<h4>3) Will ClipZip be available in any other sizes?</h4>
<p>For the 3D printed ClipZip, I can't realistically go any smaller - this rules out the size 3 found on many dresses, fleeces, cushions and wallets. However, I am able to make size 8 and size 12 an option. Size 12 are the chunkiest zips - the kind found on duffel bags and wetsuits, whereas size 8 are found on some suitcases and heavier duty jackets. Sz3, 5, 8 and 12 represent the four most common size of zipper, and will be the aim for the mass produced final versions. For now though, I am happy to make different sizes available if there is a popular demand to do so. </p>
<h4>4) I don't know if size 5 is right for me, or if I need something bigger/smaller. How do I figure out which one I need?</h4>
<p>If the zipper you want to replace is still on your jacket/bag, then take a look at the back of it - the size should be displayed here. If your zipper doesn't have this, or it has come off completely, you just need to measure the width of the zip - generally speaking, if it's 5mm across, you need a size 5 zipper. If you're struggling, send me a message and I'll be more than happy to help you out!</p>

Caught in the fast lane of Sydney's fashion world, Lo Sordo has built a small empire in this world – one that has landed him several international magazine covers – with his iconic silk trench coat for women.
PPS helps link up Australian Fashion Designers and Brands with overseas manufacturers. We charge the Australian brands for this service and then let the manufacturer and the brand deal directly with each other in terms of production and financial arrangement.
One of the manufacturers we have connected with Michael Lo Sordo is Ms Lina Miao. She recently left her job as a sample maker to start up her own business, a small clothing factory based in Humen Town, Donggguan City in the Guangdong Province of China. Together, with her husband as a cutter, she employs between 5 – 10 local sewers depending on how busy they are at any given time.
As of January 2015, Lo Sordo still owes Miss Miao ¥72958.17 ($AUD 14749.14) for producing luxury silk trench coats. (According to CNN’s online global wage calculator, which uses data from the International Labor Organization, the average annual salary of a worker in China’s private sector was 28,752 yuan (about $4,755) in 2012, or 38% of the global average)Michael has refused to pay the balance of the cost of the trench coats. 



Normal fashion production protocol is that the fashion company pays the manufacturer a % of the production cost to buy all of the fabric and materials and start production. Then once the production is finished the balance is paid and the production is released for shipping to Australia. In the past Michael has repeatedly tried to break these rules, pressuring Ms Miao to release the production before making the final payment. This is effectively asking Ms Miao to cashflow his business. 
This time Ms Miao has refused to ship the stock until payment is made. Payment was due before Christmas. Michael did not pay and then as the goods were not released, the orders were cancelled. Now he is refusing to make the payment even though the goods have been completed and are sitting in a factory waiting for payment.
You can help save Miss Miao from financial ruin, and receive the stunning silk satin trench coat currently selling on Net A Porter for over USD$850 http://www.net-a-porter.com/product/503283/Michael_Lo_Sordo/washed-silk-satin-trench-coatBy Donating:

distil a fantastic gin infused with a salty, fresh, sea essence made from kelp.
The gin will be called Kelpman Gin.<p>This
Indiegogo campaign is to complete the biofuel tank build. Once the tank is
complete it will go to Scotland and begin the limited edition Kelpman Gin distillation - it will then become part of the biofuel plant. We'll continue to distil Kelpman Gin though, and the ongoing
cash flow from sales will help with continued funding of equipment

We are a joint venture between AusBioDiesel/SPP
and the
Scottish Association of Marine Science based in Barcaldine, West of Scotland.Together
we’ve been working on a biofuel plant to convert kelp to bioethanol fuel.
We’re currently building a tank that will serve two purposes, finally it will
become part of the biofuel plant in Scotland. But its first job will be to
distil a fantastic gin infused with a salty, fresh, sea essence made from kelp.
The gin will be called Kelpman Gin.This
Indiegogo campaign is to complete the biofuel tank build. Once the tank is
complete it will go to Scotland and begin the limited edition Kelpman Gin distillation - it will then become part of the biofuel plant. We'll continue to distil Kelpman Gin though, and the ongoing
cash flow from sales will help with continued funding of equipment
for the biofuel plant.You
can support us by trying our limited edition first distil of Kelpman Gin,
joining our Gin Club and buying our Kelpman merchandise - like this T-Shirt featuring Kelpman himself.Where
we are at and what we plan to do.We
need $20,000 and three months to complete a 600L distillation unit. The unit
will then be transported to Scotland. The
first special edition batch of 60 Kelpman Gin bottles will take another month
to perfect and will then be shipped to our Indiegogo campaign supporters.Next
the distiller will begin its life as part of the biofuel tank.Our teamJaimy Tucker – Kelpman Gin flavour masterOur

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello Prospective Backer,</p>
<p>Let me start by saying that I understand this is different from other projects on this site but hear me out. I have always wanted to own a business and upon further research, I've found that there is still space for new makeup companies as long as proper marketing is done.</p>
<p>A problem that plagues the beauty world is that extreme skin shades are usually ignored or have wrong undertones. My brand is all about being affordably inclusive. I do not want a single soul feeling left out so I want my products to cover a very large range of people and to also be suitable for every skin type. I also plan to provide high quality makeup and beautiful packaging without the high prices and sell them in a lot of countries including developing countries.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So far, I have started researching ingredients, suppliers and cosmetic labs. In the next few weeks, I plan to start working on mixing different formulas. Note that the initial launch will only contain a few products and overtime, more products will be added.</p>
<p>The money goes to help me pay for the trademark, product tests, manufacturing, packaging, legal consultation, marketing, and website programming. Even if I do not reach my entire goal, I plan to figure out a way to make everything happen.</p>
<p>If you've ever bought makeup online, you know that most shades look the same and it is very difficult to buy the correct one. I would  like to offer shade matching depending on previous foundations the customer has used (only if legal).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>To prevent my brand from being obscure, I plan to take my time with marketing and also get professional help.</li>
<li>I also plan to ensure a great formula by testing each one on my skin and that of others for feedback. No animals will be used for testing.</li>
<li>To prevent any bad attention from contamination, I would like to take my time choosing a cosmetic lab to manufacture my brand and ensure that each production batch is tested for stability and purity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't help financially, all you have to do is share the news with your friends and watch out for our launch.</p>

</div></div>","www.afrikapresents.comAre you TIRED of the negative portrayal of Africa in the media and in our schools? Are you FRUSTRATED at the lack of diversity in childrens books? Do you want your children to grow up with a more COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING of the world around them? SO DO WE!  My name is Mara Menzies, storyteller and founder of 'Afrika Presents' alongside my colleague Chimezie Umeh. We believe firmly in the magic of Africa, in the wonder and the wealth of culture so vibrant it is impossible to describe.                                      CHIMEZIE                                               MARA     'Afrika Presents' has come together through the efforts of a whole host of wonderful people. Our guiding principles are to:a) instil a greater sense of self pride among children of African heritage b) enable children regardless of origin, to share in this rich cultural heritage. c) do this through fun, engaging, interactive play.These principles are at the core of what we do. CHANGING THE NARRATIVE!In this increasingly multicultural world, it is vital to challenge ignorance and negative stereotyping by providing opportunities for children to experience the world from different perspectives. And the most effective way to do this BY FAR, is through exploring, creating and imagining!And we have created the AFRICAN FASHION DESIGN SKETCHBOOK                           We are proud that this is the first EVER activity book that uniquely celebrates African fashion and its incredible history! The African Fashion Design Sketchbook will inform, entertain and inspire for hours. It is packed with a ton of features:

40 design pages



Beautiful hand drawn illustrations



2 sticker sheets



3 stencil sheets



Stories 



Fun facts



Links to an AUGMENTED REALITY APP (AR) to discover more! (This link is not ours but is just to show you what AR can do)

             HOW IT WORKS                        SWATCHES                     AMAZING HAIRWe have a 'first version' African Fashion Design Sketchbook that is a THRILLING interactive adventure through the world of kente, bogolan, kanga and more! However, it was quite big, which made it expensive to post, so that was no good!  We also wanted to provide an even better user experience! 

We have re-designed it so the pages look and feel even better!


We have improved our stencils so they are really child friendly!


We've added STICKERS! We have been working with INCREDIBLE designers such as Kiki Loves London www.kikiloveslondon.com and http://zanjoo.com/ and Ufuoma Egbede https://www.etsy.com/uk/people/uflomage who have kindly given us permission to use their designs in the sketchbook and we have developed a range of beautiful STICKER SHEETS so even the tiniest fingers can enjoy the book. We are grateful for their support and in future hope to collaborate with other exciting artists and creators!


We are also developing an AUGMENTED REALITY APP, allowing kids to go on a deeper voyage of discovery by scanning images in the book that will take them on an interactive journey through videos, games and quizzes. 

WE NEED HELP TO:A) PRINT the book itself.B) DEVELOP our AUGMENTED REALITY APP so that kids can discover even more excitement. e.g. Scan the picture of bogolan mudcloth and see a video of how it is traditionally made. (We think it's fantastically exciting and the opportunities are endless!) Once we've hit our target and the costs of production are met, then we aim to spend any additional monies we receive on further development of the content for our augmented reality app e.g. using 3D models, live texturing, etc. We would also work on the development of future products and importantly for us, to work closer with schools. African fashion is bright, bold, beautiful and rich in history and creativity. The book features kente, bogolan mudcloth, kanga and many more. There are pages to colour in, some with backgrounds to inspire but plenty of opportunities to get creative yourself.- Fulani woman from Guinea with intricate hairstyle (with SCAN ME button) - Addition of  a few backgrounds (Do you recognise the skyline?) Also see new dimension as compared to the old.- A few of our stickers, but there are plenty of others!

I looked into how Sol would be treated and what support we could expect.  I quickly learned that many toddlers abandon prosthetics early on and I wanted to know why so Sol would stand a better chance. Calling on my psychology background and my passion for engineering, I started doing my own research.  I noticed big gaps in what was being offered and saw lost opportunities at several key stages.  Rather than complain, I decided to do something about it and set up Ambionics. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492451822/kajfous9nsxmfieheub9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(Above) Dressing change at Alder Hey Children's Hospital post-amputation</i></p><p>We deliver a totally new kind of online service and are currently developing unique functional prosthetic solutions (including our world famous hydraulic technology) for children with upper limb differences everywhere.    </p><p>Our first press release (March 1 this year) went viral.  The response was truly out of this world and our story was covered in every Country and in every language. Most of the media attention centred on the hydraulic prototype we are working on. </p><p>It's inspired by the way spiders use fluid to move their legs (to find out more please follow the press links below). However, there is much more to Ambionics besides this.  Let me explain...</p><p> </p><h3>Early Intervention</h3><p><br/>Children are usually given their first prosthetic arm between 6 and 12 months of age. We introduce prosthetics much sooner - one month after an amputation (as in the case of my son) or from the moment a child with a limb difference arrives home from hospital.  The director for innovation at NHS Wales described our research based approach as ‘potentially revolutionary’. </p><p> </p><h3>Replace casting with scanning</h3><p><br/>Normally parents must take time off work to attend appointments at specialist centres which might be hundreds of miles away from where they live.  A prosthetist then creates a plaster cast mould of the affected arm and this is used to make a crude socket.  Young children often find this stressful.  They can wriggle and resist when the cast is taken and any sudden jerk can result in a poor fitting socket and a poor first experience of prosthetics. </p><p>At Ambionics, parents simply scan their child’s arm while they are asleep then upload the file to our online platform. We do the rest and deliver the prosthetic through the postal service! Simple! It takes about five minutes to do the scan and 40 minutes for us to model a socket. It’s worth noting that within two years all phones and hand held devices will come with a scanning application built in.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492452617/gk0yepflp5iblfbkbwsb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(above) The first 3D printed prototype, April 2016</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3>5 Day Turn Around (compared to 6 - 11 weeks)</h3><p><br/>A traditional prosthetic can take as long as 11 weeks to make. <br/>From a fresh scan, we can produce a new arm within a matter of hours</p><p> </p><h3>Backup Copies</h3><p><br/>If a traditional prosthetic is misplaced or damaged it can take five weeks to get an appointment for a re-mould, and another 11 weeks before the replacement arm arrives (that’s four months without an arm!).  At Ambionics we just print another from the digital copy we keep.</p><p> </p><h3>Reduced Waste</h3><p><br/>Traditional prosthetics are discarded after use.  To help keep costs down and reduce our carbon footprint, Ambionics only replace parts that need replacing or upgrading – this is usually just the detachable socket.   </p><p> </p><h3>Managing Growth Rates</h3><p><br/>Traditionally, children receive two arms per year (based on NHS service) which means that for a lot of the time the socket is either too tight or too loose.  Plaster cast arms are designed to be slightly oversized so children can grow into them. This is a false economy in our opinion because loose or unsecure arms and ones that are too tight don’t inspire confidence. It’s easy to see why so many children stop wearing them. We recommend at least four or five sockets per year depending on the needs of the child.   </p><p> </p><h3>Making Devices More Accessible</h3><p><br/>In most cases, cosmetic arms are made of fibre glass coated in varnish with a functionless silicone hand (often described as creepy looking).  These are surprisingly expensive for what they are! In the US, a cosmetic arm can cost as much as $5,000!  Our knowledge of 3D printing and scanning has the potential to seriously reduce these costs, making prosthetics accessible to children everywhere (and anywhere!)</p><p>We also believe in customising the look of the hand.  We want to help break the stigma of 'cosmetic' prosthetic devices by offering bold colours and a choice of designs for infants. <br/>We even encourage older children to take part in the design process.  What better way to meet a young person's needs than to enable them to produce their own assistive devices and accessories!</p><p>For a more detailed write-up of the background, the importance of early intervention and the cutting edge science of Ambionics, please read <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/ambionics/ambionics-background/1344569212283972/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this article</a></p><p> </p><h3>Why Crowd Fund?</h3><p> </p><p>On April 10 we announced that we are offering 20 families the chance to participate in our BETA programme - a free trial of the Ambionics service. </p><p>Within 24 hours of the announcement, over 30 families from 9 countries (from 5 continents) registered their interest. The desire to help us to iron out creases and revolutionise infant prosthetics has been overwhelming – from families, from within the life science industry and through the NHS here in Wales.</p><p>We are working alongside several multi-national companies including <strong>Autodesk </strong>and <b>Stratasys  </b>with the research being conducted through <strong>Bangor University</strong>.  These amazing organisations immediately recognised Ambionics' potential and have helped us in several important ways.  However, there are only four team members at Ambionics and only two of us work on a full time basis  (myself and Jason Griggs).  We currently volunteer our time for Ambionics for free but our savings have run out and we are not ready for investment yet. As much as we love doing this we have financial commitments just like everyone else.  We had two options – go for a bank loan or try crowd funding. </p><p>We are looking for contributions which will allow us to buy equipment for prototyping <strong>our unique hydraulic products </strong>and helping us to complete the beta trials. We have had a lot of interest from investors but we are not quite ‘investor ready’ yet and are still working on the business plan - the trials will provide the missing information that we need.  For now we are depending on the goodwill of the Indiegogo community and fund raisers everywhere to help get us to the next stage. If you would rather help by making a PayPal donation then please feel free to use the facility on our <a href=""http://www.ambionics.co.uk/fundraising"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website </a>- Thank you!</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492513402/jmfjzkn7pqsmjhskqjqv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(Above) CAD illustration of the latest functional hydraulic prototype</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3>What do the experts think?</h3><p> </p><p>""<i>NHS Wales' research and development department supports the work being carried out at Ambionics, which has the potential to revolutionise the care of infants with upper limb differences</i>.”</p><p><strong>- Dr Nefyn Williams, Director of Innovation, BCUHB, NHS Wales</strong></p><p>""<i>It’s been inspiring to work on this innovative and ambitious project.

I looked into how Sol would be treated and what support we could expect.  I quickly learned that many toddlers abandon prosthetics early on and I wanted to know why so Sol would stand a better chance. Calling on my psychology background and my passion for engineering, I started doing my own research.  I noticed big gaps in what was being offered and saw lost opportunities at several key stages.  Rather than complain, I decided to do something about it and set up Ambionics. (Above) Dressing change at Alder Hey Children's Hospital post-amputationWe deliver a totally new kind of online service and are currently developing unique functional prosthetic solutions (including our world famous hydraulic technology) for children with upper limb differences everywhere.    Our first press release (March 1 this year) went viral.  The response was truly out of this world and our story was covered in every Country and in every language. Most of the media attention centred on the hydraulic prototype we are working on. It's inspired by the way spiders use fluid to move their legs (to find out more please follow the press links below). However, there is much more to Ambionics besides this.  Let me explain... Early InterventionChildren are usually given their first prosthetic arm between 6 and 12 months of age. We introduce prosthetics much sooner - one month after an amputation (as in the case of my son) or from the moment a child with a limb difference arrives home from hospital.  The director for innovation at NHS Wales described our research based approach as ‘potentially revolutionary’.  Replace casting with scanningNormally parents must take time off work to attend appointments at specialist centres which might be hundreds of miles away from where they live.  A prosthetist then creates a plaster cast mould of the affected arm and this is used to make a crude socket.  Young children often find this stressful.  They can wriggle and resist when the cast is taken and any sudden jerk can result in a poor fitting socket and a poor first experience of prosthetics. At Ambionics, parents simply scan their child’s arm while they are asleep then upload the file to our online platform. We do the rest and deliver the prosthetic through the postal service! Simple! It takes about five minutes to do the scan and 40 minutes for us to model a socket. It’s worth noting that within two years all phones and hand held devices will come with a scanning application built in.(above) The first 3D printed prototype, April 2016 5 Day Turn Around (compared to 6 - 11 weeks)A traditional prosthetic can take as long as 11 weeks to make. From a fresh scan, we can produce a new arm within a matter of hours Backup CopiesIf a traditional prosthetic is misplaced or damaged it can take five weeks to get an appointment for a re-mould, and another 11 weeks before the replacement arm arrives (that’s four months without an arm!).  At Ambionics we just print another from the digital copy we keep. Reduced WasteTraditional prosthetics are discarded after use.  To help keep costs down and reduce our carbon footprint, Ambionics only replace parts that need replacing or upgrading – this is usually just the detachable socket.    Managing Growth RatesTraditionally, children receive two arms per year (based on NHS service) which means that for a lot of the time the socket is either too tight or too loose.  Plaster cast arms are designed to be slightly oversized so children can grow into them. This is a false economy in our opinion because loose or unsecure arms and ones that are too tight don’t inspire confidence. It’s easy to see why so many children stop wearing them. We recommend at least four or five sockets per year depending on the needs of the child.    Making Devices More AccessibleIn most cases, cosmetic arms are made of fibre glass coated in varnish with a functionless silicone hand (often described as creepy looking).  These are surprisingly expensive for what they are! In the US, a cosmetic arm can cost as much as $5,000!  Our knowledge of 3D printing and scanning has the potential to seriously reduce these costs, making prosthetics accessible to children everywhere (and anywhere!)We also believe in customising the look of the hand.  We want to help break the stigma of 'cosmetic' prosthetic devices by offering bold colours and a choice of designs for infants. We even encourage older children to take part in the design process.  What better way to meet a young person's needs than to enable them to produce their own assistive devices and accessories!For a more detailed write-up of the background, the importance of early intervention and the cutting edge science of Ambionics, please read this article Why Crowd Fund? On April 10 we announced that we are offering 20 families the chance to participate in our BETA programme - a free trial of the Ambionics service. Within 24 hours of the announcement, over 30 families from 9 countries (from 5 continents) registered their interest. The desire to help us to iron out creases and revolutionise infant prosthetics has been overwhelming – from families, from within the life science industry and through the NHS here in Wales.We are working alongside several multi-national companies including Autodesk and Stratasys  with the research being conducted through Bangor University.  These amazing organisations immediately recognised Ambionics' potential and have helped us in several important ways.  However, there are only four team members at Ambionics and only two of us work on a full time basis  (myself and Jason Griggs).  We currently volunteer our time for Ambionics for free but our savings have run out and we are not ready for investment yet. As much as we love doing this we have financial commitments just like everyone else.  We had two options – go for a bank loan or try crowd funding. We are looking for contributions which will allow us to buy equipment for prototyping our unique hydraulic products and helping us to complete the beta trials. We have had a lot of interest from investors but we are not quite ‘investor ready’ yet and are still working on the business plan - the trials will provide the missing information that we need.  For now we are depending on the goodwill of the Indiegogo community and fund raisers everywhere to help get us to the next stage. If you would rather help by making a PayPal donation then please feel free to use the facility on our website - Thank you! (Above) CAD illustration of the latest functional hydraulic prototype What do the experts think? ""NHS Wales' research and development department supports the work being carried out at Ambionics, which has the potential to revolutionise the care of infants with upper limb differences.”- Dr Nefyn Williams, Director of Innovation, BCUHB, NHS Wales""It’s been inspiring to work on this innovative and ambitious project.

So 3/4 of the funds will go to secure the first month's rent and security deposit and 2nd month's rent. The rest of the money will go to purchasing the following business equipment:
Ipad with stand/card reader [$500] 
Kiosk fixtures and stands [$500]
Liability insurance [$1000]    

Funds are not the only way to support

<p><strong>WHAT IS A LUKU SNAPBACK WATCH?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The world’s first hybrid design of a snapback hat and watch—a snapback watch</strong>. It's a watch, which for the first time ever, places a new emphasis on the opposite side. Because of this unique customizable feature, the snapback watch stands above all the redundant styles other watches express.  </p>

<p>The Luku Snapback Watch is a provisional patent watch design that was drafted for supernal comfort, durability, and adjustability, all whilst maintaining the fresh style our customers desire. The unique hybrid design fits our customers' unique fashion styles that change on a day-to-day basis.  </p>
<p>The unique Snap feature not only allows for this fresh style and individuality to be expressed in different colors, but also allows for a one-size-fits-all feature on the premium athletic band.  </p>
<p><u>Does the world need another watch brand? </u></p>
<p>It is an interesting question, and it has only one answer: Not really. There are enough watch brands creating slightly different looks, but none have radically transformed the style like Luku Watches. Luckily, Luku isn't your typical watch brand; <strong>we are reinventing watches.</strong></p>
<p>A better product—a better style. Our product is for the trendsetter in everyone.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>LUKU WATCHES WARRANTY</strong></p>
<p>We want our consumers to not only love this new style, but also feel confident in their purchase’s ability to last. We ensure a<strong> two-year limited warranty</strong> for our watches, meaning that if there are any manufacturer’s defects that incur within a two-year time frame after initial purchase, we will either fix or replace the watch for free. This warranty includes all internal parts of the watch.</p>
<p><strong>Warranty does not cover</strong>:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Wear and tear (e.g. scratched crystal, alteration of the color of band, etc.)</li>
<li>Any damage to the product resulting from abusive use and/or negligent treatment (e.g. accidental dents, water damage, broken watch face, etc.) </li>

This is a way for YOU to not only support Luku in its first ever mass production, but also get our amazing product(s) in return at a SPECIAL LAUNCH DISCOUNT!                                                                                                             THE CLASSIC SNAPBACK HATThe history of the snapback hat design began in the 1980s and spanned through the 1990s in urban cities like Los Angeles and New York. It began to be adopted as an urban symbol of soul and artistry.  Not only were snapback hats wildly collected with urban styles, but they became a fashion accessory for all types of people from all walks of life.

 

 


 
WHAT IS A LUKU SNAPBACK WATCH?
The world’s first hybrid design of a snapback hat and watch—a snapback watch. It's a watch, which for the first time ever, places a new emphasis on the opposite side. Because of this unique customizable feature, the snapback watch stands above all the redundant styles other watches express.  






 
 

 With our name Luku meaning unique, we decided to have our watch face designs represent that. While they are all different, there is one common feature - Interchangeable Snapback Bands.  The Premium Athletic Bands are available for either S/M or M/L length.   The main feature of our watches is our unique interchangeable snapback bands that can be changed to fit your style preference.  TECHNICAL INFO
Case Material: 316L Carbon Stainless Steel
Case Diameter: 40mm 
Face Diameter: 37mm
 Bezel Width: 2mm Maximum
 Band Width: 20mm 
Dial Window Material: Crystal Mineral Glass 
Display: Analog Movement Seiko VX19 (Japanese Quartz) 
Date Function: Yes 
Pin: Stainless Steel 
 Water Resistant: 3 ATM
   INTERCHANGEABILITY OF SNAPBACK BANDSThe variety of colors offered in the bands, loops, and snaps allows for complete and total customization for a look that is perfectly unique to you. Below are a few examples of combinations that could work. Sometimes all that is needed is just changing the Snap, but in the reality, the possibilities are endless! After our campaign, we plan to continue to produce more colors and designs.      

 
 
The Luku Snapback Watch is a provisional patent watch design that was drafted for supernal comfort, durability, and adjustability, all whilst maintaining the fresh style our customers desire. The unique hybrid design fits our customers' unique fashion styles that change on a day-to-day basis.  
The unique Snap feature not only allows for this fresh style and individuality to be expressed in different colors, but also allows for a one-size-fits-all feature on the premium athletic band.  
Does the world need another watch brand? 
It is an interesting question, and it has only one answer: Not really. There are enough watch brands creating slightly different looks, but none have radically transformed the style like Luku Watches. Luckily, Luku isn't your typical watch brand; we are reinventing watches.
A better product—a better style. Our product is for the trendsetter in everyone.  

 
LUKU WATCHES WARRANTY
We want our consumers to not only love this new style, but also feel confident in their purchase’s ability to last. We ensure a two-year limited warranty for our watches, meaning that if there are any manufacturer’s defects that incur within a two-year time frame after initial purchase, we will either fix or replace the watch for free. This warranty includes all internal parts of the watch.
Warranty does not cover:  

Wear and tear (e.g. scratched crystal, alteration of the color of band, etc.)
Any damage to the product resulting from abusive use and/or negligent treatment (e.g. accidental dents, water damage, broken watch face, etc.) 

 
 
FUTURE RETAIL PRICING AND BREAKDOWN   For the past three years, we have made prototypes through an established manufacturing company in Shenzhen, China called Acrivia Innovations  known for its quality control. Our relationship with our manufacturers has been phenomenal. The watch faces and bands are evidence of the countless hours of work spent together to develop a watch that is unlike anything out there. With us, our manufactures are determined to build Luku's movement into a world wide known brand. After many occasions of visiting the factory to evaluate the stages in making our watches (the bands specifically as they are completely unique to Luku) we are 100% confident that their facilities meet all necessary regulations for operations and will deliver these quality products. PRODUCTION TIMELINE  WHEN FUNDED, HOW WILL LUKU FULFILL ORDERS?Our structural designs have been finalized and mass production is ready to be underway.  Once Indiegogo releases the funds after reaching our goal, we will pay the initial deposit to begin production.  Mold production takes roughly 30 days, as does the production of the watches. Add those 60 days to the estimated freight time and in all it should be about 70-80 days total. After production and packaging, our team will ship the orders to our amazing backers. *Please note that our ability to complete production is dependent upon your support of backing us. We hope that with your help we can make our campaign a success.       PRODUCT SHOWCASE GALLERY   LUKU LIFESTYLE  LOOK BOOK   OUR PATH TO THE FUTUREProduct ImageWe aim to build a global brand with a collection of watches that are always unique and one step ahead of the trends of the day, all the while staying at an affordable cost. Beginning immediately, we plan to create more options for style in addition to the silicone Premium Athletic Band, while still maintaining the snapback element that makes Luku so unique. Brand ImageMeanwhile, as we grow, we want to establish our brand as more than just products, but a culture & community of unique artists who seek to rise toward their creative goals by supporting each other.

<h2>What are High Heeled Hybrids</h2>
<p></p>
<p>High Heeled Hybrids combine modern technology with a high level of craftsmanship, using 3D printing as well as traditional shoe making techniques in the production process.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Where did the concept of High Heeled Hybrids come from?</h3>
<p>As a shoe designer, I was interested in combining concepts deriving from organic, natural structures as well as modern technology. I have always appreciated how natural structures and living organisms look, and I wanted to utilize these concept ideas into my shoe designs. Thus I began exploring how natural structures could be incorporated into high heels.</p>

</span></p>
<p>The process started with hand drawings and continued with my design ideas being reproduced using 3-D software. Then followed a prototyping process, with several designs being considered before the final decisions were made.  During this process I created complex heel structures inspired by natural load-bearing structures – refining designs until I was satisfied with the aesthetics of the shoes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The finished heels were then 3D Printed using Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technology, sanded and spray-painted. The 3D Printing material is strong and flexible providing the excellent support needed for a heel. </p>
<p>

<p>The shoe uppers were fabricated using textured cow leathers as part of my High Heeled Hybrids. This inspiration came from the natural texture, and continued the theme of nature throughout my designs. The white leather also adds a soft texture to the shoes. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the black embossing leather was made using a stamp which was created using 3-D design software. These embossing patterns were also inspired by shapes found in nature.</p>
<p>As a shoe designer I consider footwear not only from the perspective of its appearance, but also I believe it should be like creating a new layer of skin to cover the wearers’ foot, and I therefore choose high quality cow leather and soft sheepskin for shoe linings.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My customers can also receive a pair of individual custom-made shoe lasts which can speed up the future shoe-making process - for additional pairs or new designs for example.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>What are shoe lasts? </h4>
<p>Shoe lasts represent the anatomical information of the client’s foot, whilst at the same time giving the finished shoe a pleasing and fashionable appearance. They are used as a mould for creating the shoe’s exact shape. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Your unique shoe last will be created by a 3-D scanner, coupled with 3-D software and a 3-D printer which is using for prototyping. This means that the shoes will be a perfect fit and be matched exactly to your foot.</p>
<p>Once the shoe lasts are finished, they will be reproduced using standard materials, meaning you will have a pair of tailored shoes lasts a couple of months later.  </p>

</div></div>","What are High Heeled Hybrids

High Heeled Hybrids combine modern technology with a high level of craftsmanship, using 3D printing as well as traditional shoe making techniques in the production process.



Where did the concept of High Heeled Hybrids come from?
As a shoe designer, I was interested in combining concepts deriving from organic, natural structures as well as modern technology. I have always appreciated how natural structures and living organisms look, and I wanted to utilize these concept ideas into my shoe designs. Thus I began exploring how natural structures could be incorporated into high heels.

The making of High Heeled Hybrids



The process started with hand drawings and continued with my design ideas being reproduced using 3-D software. Then followed a prototyping process, with several designs being considered before the final decisions were made.  During this process I created complex heel structures inspired by natural load-bearing structures – refining designs until I was satisfied with the aesthetics of the shoes.

The finished heels were then 3D Printed using Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technology, sanded and spray-painted. The 3D Printing material is strong and flexible providing the excellent support needed for a heel. 


The shoe uppers were fabricated using textured cow leathers as part of my High Heeled Hybrids. This inspiration came from the natural texture, and continued the theme of nature throughout my designs. The white leather also adds a soft texture to the shoes. 


Furthermore, the black embossing leather was made using a stamp which was created using 3-D design software. These embossing patterns were also inspired by shapes found in nature.
As a shoe designer I consider footwear not only from the perspective of its appearance, but also I believe it should be like creating a new layer of skin to cover the wearers’ foot, and I therefore choose high quality cow leather and soft sheepskin for shoe linings.


My customers can also receive a pair of individual custom-made shoe lasts which can speed up the future shoe-making process - for additional pairs or new designs for example.


What are shoe lasts? 
Shoe lasts represent the anatomical information of the client’s foot, whilst at the same time giving the finished shoe a pleasing and fashionable appearance. They are used as a mould for creating the shoe’s exact shape. 


Your unique shoe last will be created by a 3-D scanner, coupled with 3-D software and a 3-D printer which is using for prototyping. This means that the shoes will be a perfect fit and be matched exactly to your foot.
Once the shoe lasts are finished, they will be reproduced using standard materials, meaning you will have a pair of tailored shoes lasts a couple of months later.  

   What We Need & What You Get

</div></div>","For the past 6 years I have poured my creativity and passion into this project. It truly is, a culmination of my life's work and I am so grateful that I will soon be able to share this healing space with you!  My dream was to create a place that would provide New Yorkers with that I felt was lacking: nature, peace, water, relaxation and make it affordable and accessible, cityWell Brooklyn, is that place.


cityWell, will be the only boutique bathhouse of its kind in New York City. With competitive pricing,  urban location and superior design, it will be a stand out from other bathhouses in the city.   Offering top of the line quality of service and equipment:  Steam room,  luxurious rain showers,  cedar relaxation area and treatment room along with an amazing 1,500 feet of outdoor space, it will be unlike anything that exists in Brooklyn. Treatments such as massage therapy, acupuncture, private yoga and wellness coaching will be offered as well as educational talks on health and nutrition. Truly, paradise in the city!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>About me, Orcraphics and cross stitch</h3> <p>Cross stitch is my absolute passion. I started both stitching and the entire company through my love for Killer Whales (hence our logo). My aunt bought me my first stamped (pre-printed) cross stitch project because it had killer whales on it. Slowly but surely cross stitch has started to take over my life, and I wouldnt want it any other way!</p>
<p>Orcraphics Cross Stitch is my own cross stitch brand. We sell worldwide and have shops on Etsy, Amazon (US and UK) besides our own webshops on our website. We work with retailers in the Netherlands. We make realistic cross stitch designs with low amounts of colours and grouped stitches so they are simple and fun to stitch. </p>
<p>We dont convert photos, but use them as molds as to hold on to the photorealism but without the enormous amounts of colours and loose stitches.Though we are blessed to work with a couple very talented wildlife photographers, I want and need to expand to other themes. In order to do that, we need stock photos. Hopefully, thats where you come in.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Your contribution will be used to buy stock photos with extended licenses. We try to stay away from the more well known, but also more expensive stock photo platforms so we can buy as many as possible. But we always judge by quality, not just the prices.</p>
<p>Then the magic happens, we use that photo as a mold to create a stitchable but realistic cross stitch design. That design will either be sold as a seperate pattern also known as charts, or as a complete kit that contains everything you need to finish the project (needle, floss, fabric etc). There are too many new directions we want to grow in to name them all, but just to list a few:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>People: we only have animals now and we really want to buy pictures of humans, but we need the right release forms in order to use someone's face</li>
<li>Fantasy: fairies, elves, angels, dragons, mermaids, vampires, witches, magic scenes, it would open up a whole new world!</li>
<li>Halloween: I love Halloween, and would love to make some scary designs</li>
<li>Architecture: Buildings, houses, even castles! From places all around the world I can't get to myself, or am unable to find information about (buildings can be copyrighted too!)</li>
<li>Pets: They are animals, but certainly not wildlife</li>
<li>Plants and flowers: We plan to photograph some of these ourselves, as I am not a bad photographer myself. But certain settings or special flowers I can't get photos of without the use of stock photos</li>
<li>Christmas: More Christmas! I love christmas time. We have a few christmas designs, but the really fun, high quality and detailed images are out of our reach. As the person who made them (deservingly!) wants to be paid for their effort.</li>
</ul>
<div><b>What if the goal is not reached?</b></div>
<div>Well, the cheapest extended licenses we have been able to find are in the 10-15 euros range. So if we dont make our goal, it simple means we will be able to buy less than the estimated 20-30 photos we can buy for our goal amount. But as we dont have that many products at the moment (about 70) even a few pictures can make a big difference. Especially if you consider the new customers you can attract that are not looking for wildlife.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Perks</h3> <p>We will be forever gratefull, no matter if you have contributed 1 euro or a 1000. We have tried to include perks for those of you who dont do cross stitch yourself. But if you want something a little different, just contact me and I will see what I can do for you. </p>
<p>Remember, the finished pieces will be stitched by hand! So it will take a while to finish them for you.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The only risk in this is that we buy the wrong photos. Meaning, the resulting designs are not selling. This is always the risk of any business, it does not even matter whether you buy the products from the producer or wholesaler of if you are the producer as in our case. I think the odds of this are lower than for other companies as I have been a cross stitcher all my life and I know the market and the needs. Also I keep a very close eye on different Facebook groups around cross stitching and I listen very carefully at craft faires to learn what people are looking for.</p>

</div></div>","About me, Orcraphics and cross stitch Cross stitch is my absolute passion. I started both stitching and the entire company through my love for Killer Whales (hence our logo). My aunt bought me my first stamped (pre-printed) cross stitch project because it had killer whales on it. Slowly but surely cross stitch has started to take over my life, and I wouldnt want it any other way!
Orcraphics Cross Stitch is my own cross stitch brand. We sell worldwide and have shops on Etsy, Amazon (US and UK) besides our own webshops on our website. We work with retailers in the Netherlands. We make realistic cross stitch designs with low amounts of colours and grouped stitches so they are simple and fun to stitch. 
We dont convert photos, but use them as molds as to hold on to the photorealism but without the enormous amounts of colours and loose stitches.Though we are blessed to work with a couple very talented wildlife photographers, I want and need to expand to other themes. In order to do that, we need stock photos. Hopefully, thats where you come in.   What We Need & What You Get Your contribution will be used to buy stock photos with extended licenses. We try to stay away from the more well known, but also more expensive stock photo platforms so we can buy as many as possible. But we always judge by quality, not just the prices.
Then the magic happens, we use that photo as a mold to create a stitchable but realistic cross stitch design. That design will either be sold as a seperate pattern also known as charts, or as a complete kit that contains everything you need to finish the project (needle, floss, fabric etc). There are too many new directions we want to grow in to name them all, but just to list a few:


People: we only have animals now and we really want to buy pictures of humans, but we need the right release forms in order to use someone's face
Fantasy: fairies, elves, angels, dragons, mermaids, vampires, witches, magic scenes, it would open up a whole new world!
Halloween: I love Halloween, and would love to make some scary designs
Architecture: Buildings, houses, even castles! From places all around the world I can't get to myself, or am unable to find information about (buildings can be copyrighted too!)
Pets: They are animals, but certainly not wildlife
Plants and flowers: We plan to photograph some of these ourselves, as I am not a bad photographer myself. But certain settings or special flowers I can't get photos of without the use of stock photos
Christmas: More Christmas! I love christmas time. We have a few christmas designs, but the really fun, high quality and detailed images are out of our reach. As the person who made them (deservingly!) wants to be paid for their effort.

What if the goal is not reached?
Well, the cheapest extended licenses we have been able to find are in the 10-15 euros range. So if we dont make our goal, it simple means we will be able to buy less than the estimated 20-30 photos we can buy for our goal amount. But as we dont have that many products at the moment (about 70) even a few pictures can make a big difference. Especially if you consider the new customers you can attract that are not looking for wildlife.
    Perks We will be forever gratefull, no matter if you have contributed 1 euro or a 1000. We have tried to include perks for those of you who dont do cross stitch yourself. But if you want something a little different, just contact me and I will see what I can do for you. 
Remember, the finished pieces will be stitched by hand! So it will take a while to finish them for you.
    Risks & Challenges The only risk in this is that we buy the wrong photos. Meaning, the resulting designs are not selling. This is always the risk of any business, it does not even matter whether you buy the products from the producer or wholesaler of if you are the producer as in our case. I think the odds of this are lower than for other companies as I have been a cross stitcher all my life and I know the market and the needs. Also I keep a very close eye on different Facebook groups around cross stitching and I listen very carefully at craft faires to learn what people are looking for.
We test the photos before buying them to see if they work, by a simple conversion program that will tell us if the details will even 'fit' in a certain size cross stitch kit and how the colours turn out. We simply use the photo with watermark to test this. Aside from the watermark, we have always tested photos this way, so there is no risk of buying photos that ultimately cant be made into a cross stitch design.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>EcoEquitable is a dynamic, women-led charity and social enterprise based in Ottawa. We employ immigrant and marginalized women to transform discarded and recycled fabrics by sewing them into beautiful things like conference bags and corporate gifts. We transform materials, people, situations, environments, perspectives, and the world.</p>
<p>We are women crafting a better story.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In the midst of this unprecedented global pandemic, our healthcare workers are heroes. As most of us are quarantining and cooped up in our homes, they are on the front lines and risking their lives every single day in order to save the lives of others. So we decided to find some small way to thank them for everything that they do.</p>
<p>As it turns out, wearing a surgical mask all day every day is hard on your ears. It becomes incredibly painful. That’s the daily reality of the people who are dedicating themselves to helping others. In order to show our thanks in some small way, we’ve created a solution—a headband with buttons on it that they can hook the mask onto. Since we can’t give them all hugs and tell them how grateful we are, this is our way of showing every single one of them that we are all in this together.</p>
<p>We want to create thousands of these headbands and send them to as many healthcare workers as possible. We will begin with Ottawa hospitals and health facilities, then Ontario, and then all of Canada. Let’s do everything we can to make the lives of our healthcare workers just a little bit easier.</p>
<p>Note that all contributions are eligible for a charitable receipt.  We will mail out all receipts at the end of the campaign for donations $20 and over.  Thank you!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We need your help to buy fabric, employ our seamstresses, coordinate the effort, properly sterilize everything, and cover postage, so that we can show healthcare workers across Canada how thankful we are for them and everything they do.</p>

What We Need & What You Get

At the moment we produce every MEDALdisplay in small quantities: For us right now, mass production is not sustainable (the high quality materials and meticulous process are very costly). 
We have set a goal of 80,000 euro in order to start a mass production of MEDALdisplay that satisfies the full range of sports and every type of sport.
With this amount, we will also be capable of meeting the demands of eventual customizations ensuring a minimum supply, even without significantly raising our standard prices. 
Wouldn't it be great to have your own custom display?

Here is our story and what we propose to do with your help:



What happens if we do not reach this target?
For our supporters, nothing changes.We will always protect your orders, even if we do not reach the target. 
Our first goal is to please the customer at any cost. Always!
Other Ways You Can Help
Choose a ""Perk"" if you desire and start thinking about your successes; we will do everything to highlight your medals and we are proud to work with you in creating your new MEDALdisplay.
If you cannot help us financially, do not worry! You can support us by publicizing our product among your sports friends or by using the Indiegogo sharing tools

Founder

Christophe Schuhmann, French-American, 53, living in San Francisco since 1999. 2 daughters and 2 grand-daughters.

Christophe, born in Paris, moved when he was  nine months to Cameroon and Congo, following the steps of his Dad, a Crédit
Lyonnais banker. After studying
political sciences in Paris and
business in Bordeaux , Christophe created his first company Microgolf in 1986 at age 25 and 3 years later, added a tech software company PanoramaTechnologies, who achieved to modelize in 3 D any landscape including golf courses.
He moved to California in May 1999 and created a wine import company ""Les Petits Châteaux"".
After various positions in software companies, including Google,
as quality assurance engineer, Christophe re-oriented his career onto the business side and is currently holding a position at Swit­chfly, SasS company in travel and hospitality space,  as lead implementation manager.







Beginnings

On November 29th, 2014, Christophe, invited to a Junior Prom theme house-warming party, while dres­sing for the party, instinctively ties his tie around his neck directly on his skin, inside the collar.
SkinTie was born.
Receiving a lot of positive feedback since then, Christophe decided in December to go for it and launched SKINTIE, INC, reserved the domain name skintie.com, registered Skintie (TEAS#86467135), defined and setup an online store ( http://skintie.com/), hired fashion
designers to create prototypes and organized Skintie first photo shoot in Los Angeles in January 2015. Rapidly followed by a video shoot on August 8 in Laguna Beach. Video directed by Thierry Brouard and showcased on our Indiegogo campaign.





Product
Designed and crafted with extreme care
and flare,
using the best silks or soft fabrics like satin, taffeta, linen with or without jewelry, each skintie is hand-made and customized, thanks to the silk printing technology. Manufacturing will stay local in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
When you wear a skintie for the first time, you immediately feel different. You feel elegant and moving in style.  You are breaking codes, softly, with fun and joy.
The
boring conventional, outdated traditional tie, around your collar, pinching your neck should just vanish :)
Be cool, wear a SkinTie!
You can wear a SkinTie for any
occasions at work, cocktails and soirees, or even when practi­cing sports like golf, horse riding, tennis, polo, sailing...
SkinTie is already offe­ring custom made corporate option for tech companies. high-end restaurants, hair-salons, fashion boutiques, airlines...
SkinTie lawyers are currently defining the bases
for licensing contract to allow any recognized fashion brand to design and sell
skinties of their own. 
3% of all profits and licensing fees will
fund non-profit programs.

<p>""THIS IS MY GOLDEN CHANCE', says Storai Stanizai, age 22, ""PLEASE HELP ME TO CATCH MY DREAMS"".</p><p>Help bring the extraordinary talents of a young Afghan woman to the world.<br/><br/>Born under the oppressive rule of the Taliban and growing up during the instability of war, odds were stacked against Storai Stanizai. Through relentless effort she made the most of her uncommon abilities, realizing her creative and leadership potential through the creation of unique jewelry. Now Storai needs your support to advance her journey. We are raising $18,000 to make this happen.<br/><br/>In 2001, when she was just 8-years-old, Storai won a mural painting competition at her school, and at 10 created a small workshop in her home to master the craft of jewelry making. In 2013 Storai founded ZYB Designs, and with the support of Sophie Swire from Future Brilliance, Storai was able to grow her craft into a business, bringing in young jewelers and gem-cutters to realize the dream of setting up an Afghanistan-based co-operative and providing employment for other talented women jewelers. <br/><br/>Storai gained valuable training and support in Jaipur, India, from acclaimed designers Jon Harwood, Michael Boys and Elisabeth Pfahl (a short video of Storai's trip to Jaipur below). Through Future Brilliance and its social enterprise Aayenda Jewelry, Storai designed the annual Kellogg Innovation Network (KIN) commemorative coin for Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. Storai was invited to Chicago to attend the KIN Global conference in May 2015, by Kellogg School of Management Professor of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Robert C. Wolcott, where she exhibited her designs and spoke passionately about her ambitions for the Aayenda Jewelry Co-Operative, the lives of Afghan women artisans and her own hopes for the future.<br/><br/>Storai is ready to further her training in leadership, marketing and creative design. She has been awarded a partial scholarship by the prestigious Gemological Institute of America (GIA) to study jewelry design in London this Fall, 2015. Proceeds from our campaign will fund the balance, including travel, accommodation, supplies, media and bookkeeping work.<br/><br/>USE OF PROCEEDS:<br/><br/></p><table><tbody>

<p>The mission of the Georgia Track Club is supporting Georgia’s elite athletes and the communities that help them reach their dreams. Most people don’t realize that Olympians live below the poverty line and face financial hardships due to sacrifices they make for their dreams. Dr. Josh Glass felt compelled to create this nonprofit after many years working with the world’s most accomplished Olympic track and field athletes. The work ethic, resilience and character that they displayed was admirable. He was also impressed with their ability to accomplish great athletic feats despite a lack of resources.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In our first years, the Georgia Track Club has already begun fulfilling our commitment to serve the great communities of Georgia under the direction of executive director, and three-time Olympian, Hazel Clark. Our athletes have made numerous appearances, presented our Champions Don’t Bully program at local schools, given motivational talks to aspiring students, launched our Sportswear from Stars Donation program and most recently held our first annual Family Fit Fun Run Day, which was a great success.</span></p>
<p>These programs and events have given our athletes a platform to reach out and give back to the communities that have molded them into the people they are today.  Now it is time for us to focus on another important reason for the existence of the club: financial support for our athletes as they embark on their journey to the world’s biggest stage:the Olympic games.</p>
<p>Training and competing for a spot on the Olympic team is a very expensive endeavor and requires laser focus on the task at hand. Many Olympic dreams end because of a lack of resources. For every Olympic Gold medalist like Dwight Phillips, Chris Brown, Christian Taylor or Angelo Taylor, there are many athletes that missed their golden opportunity because they simply could not afford to continue.  </p>
<p>Please consider supporting our GTC athletes during our GoBold4Gold fundraising campaign. Your support will be used to assist our Olympians and Olympic hopefuls with medical care, travel costs, coaching fees and daily basic living expenses - all necessary for any athlete to thrive. Your donation means that you are joining the team behind the team and sending the message to our athletes that they have a community of support behind them. Each donation level will be associated with a personalized gift from the GTC as a token of our thanks for your vital support.

The work ethic, resilience and character that they displayed was admirable. He was also impressed with their ability to accomplish great athletic feats despite a lack of resources.
In our first years, the Georgia Track Club has already begun fulfilling our commitment to serve the great communities of Georgia under the direction of executive director, and three-time Olympian, Hazel Clark. Our athletes have made numerous appearances, presented our Champions Don’t Bully program at local schools, given motivational talks to aspiring students, launched our Sportswear from Stars Donation program and most recently held our first annual Family Fit Fun Run Day, which was a great success.
These programs and events have given our athletes a platform to reach out and give back to the communities that have molded them into the people they are today.  Now it is time for us to focus on another important reason for the existence of the club: financial support for our athletes as they embark on their journey to the world’s biggest stage:the Olympic games.
Training and competing for a spot on the Olympic team is a very expensive endeavor and requires laser focus on the task at hand. Many Olympic dreams end because of a lack of resources. For every Olympic Gold medalist like Dwight Phillips, Chris Brown, Christian Taylor or Angelo Taylor, there are many athletes that missed their golden opportunity because they simply could not afford to continue.  
Please consider supporting our GTC athletes during our GoBold4Gold fundraising campaign. Your support will be used to assist our Olympians and Olympic hopefuls with medical care, travel costs, coaching fees and daily basic living expenses - all necessary for any athlete to thrive. Your donation means that you are joining the team behind the team and sending the message to our athletes that they have a community of support behind them. Each donation level will be associated with a personalized gift from the GTC as a token of our thanks for your vital support. The thank you packages include merchandise signed by Olympic Gold medalists, GTC apparel and a dream trip to the Olympic trials.Feel free to share this information with your family, friends and your social media followers.

<p><strong>Chanier is a vision for the future of Fine Jewelry, embracing total transparency and honest pricing. </strong>We believe that beauty, quality and sustainability should go hand in hand.  That’s why each C Bracelet purchased will help fund Kitechild (<a href=""http://www.kitechild.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.kitechild.org</a>). It’s an organization dear to our hearts because, like us, they support “Change, not charity.”</p>

<p>Through the collaboration with Kitechild, profits from the C Bracelet will directly fund the Mother Esther Home. This remarkable site offers shelter to girls at risk of, or already victim to, being submitted to FGM and early childhood marriage. In addition to providing a safe haven for these young girls and their mothers, it also provides counseling, therapy for victims and reunification services.</p>

We believe that beauty, quality and sustainability should go hand in hand.  That’s why each C Bracelet purchased will help fund Kitechild (http://www.kitechild.org). It’s an organization dear to our hearts because, like us, they support “Change, not charity.”

Each purchase of the C Bracelet supports women & children fleeing child marriage.

Through the collaboration with Kitechild, profits from the C Bracelet will directly fund the Mother Esther Home. This remarkable site offers shelter to girls at risk of, or already victim to, being submitted to FGM and early childhood marriage. In addition to providing a safe haven for these young girls and their mothers, it also provides counseling, therapy for victims and reunification services.

We design and then we create. Throughout the whole process of developing MiniMAX wallets 1 & 2 and now the MM2+ sets, she has worked hard with us creating countless prototypes and she is an invaluable member of our team. Thank you Beata!! 
THE RUBBER-BAND SECURES THE CARDS INSIDE OF THE MM2+ & MAKES SURE THE WALLET STAYS CLOSED
True story: Simon hasn't lost a single card since creating elastic-protected MM1
The rubber band falls of automatically when you open the wallet - super easy!!
The elastic material used in MM2+ is extremely strong and will last years of everyday use. You could see Simon hanging on the red rubber band in the video – and he’s more of a Viking rather than a small princess  ;-) 
PERSONALISE YOUR MM+ WALLETSIf you add this option, we will laser engrave your wallets with what you want, e.g.:
“Happy 50th birthday, Mom”
“This is Tom’s wallet ;)”
Your Phone Number, Initials, Name, etc.
MM2+ WALLETS STORE UP TO 12 CARDS, PLENTY BANKNOTES AND COINS ^^^
When designing MiniMAX+ we wanted it to have Mini-mum size and MAX-imum functionality. So the wallet is small yet does more than traditional wallets.
MM2+ is long enough to secure very long banknotes such as US Dollars $ and tall enough to protect banknotes as tall as British Pounds £.

Bio ActiveWear will be involved with NGO’s and charity projects where children

<br/>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you can't donate your money, please donate your time!!! You can just like and share this campaign in social media, tell your friends about it, and help us spread the word! <br/><br/><h2>Questions</h2>
<ul><li><h4>What will happen if you don't reach your goal?</h4></li></ul>
<p>Everybody that contributed will receive their perks and the NGO's will receive the proportional donation. And you will only be charged at the end of campaign.</p>
<ul><li><h4>And if you reach more than you asked for?</h4></li></ul>
<p>I will be able to help more and more children and NGO's. I just need a lot of people interested on my Perks!<br/></p>
<ul><li><h4>When are you gonna produce and delivery the perks?</h4></li></ul>
<p>I will start the production on January. Will delivery them on March. The delivery time can vary from Brazil to other countries. It takes approximate 15/20 business days to delivery, it depends on which part of the world do you live.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><h4>The price is almost the same of a non biodegradable piece, what's wrong?</h4></li></ul>
<p>By the time that I'm launching this campaign, we are living an economic crisis in Brazil, that makes the pieces cheaper for people who lives under a better economy system. <br/></p>
<ul><li><h4>Why all the pieces from your collection is Black?</h4></li></ul>Who doesn't have a black piece on the wardrobe? Everybody loves a black, simple, basic and unique piece!

</h3>
<br/>
<p>Meu nome é Ana
Leo. 
Sou designer gráfica,
especializada em Design de Produto, e com pós-graduação em História da Moda. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Há 9 anos, criei a Santik Beachwear, um projeto caseiro que se tornou uma pequena marca de biquínis e
roupas esportivas. Além da coleção própria
também crio e produzo peças para diversas marcas de biquínis brasileiras e estrangeiras. </p>
<p>Conectada com a natureza, meio ambiente e com um estilo de vida
outdoor, hoje a Santik está pronta para dar um próximo passo. Um passo muito
importante para o planeta e para toda a sociedade brasileira. </p>
<ul></ul>
<p>Santik Bio ActiveWear, será uma coleção
de camisetas, calças, shorts, leggings, regatas e tops confeccionados
com tecido 100% biodegradável, desenvolvido no Brasil, em
processos produtivos que respeitam o planeta e ser humano, da produção ao
consumo. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Diferentemente
dos outros tecidos, o da  Santik Bio ActiveWear, foi criado e desenvolvido de
forma sustentável,<b>em todas as etapas da cadeia produtiva.</b>
</h3>
<p>Mas aí vem a
pergunta: se o tecido é biodegradável, quer dizer que a peça vai começar a se
desmanchar com o uso? Não! Isto não vai ocorrer; nada irá se desfazer no seu
corpo. O processo de decomposição só se inicia após o descarte, com o contato
da peça com o solo e mais especificamente nos aterros sanitários em que as
roupas venham a ser depositadas.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Uma iniciativa pioneira no país e até fora dele!<br/>
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Como outro
importante objetivo, o projeto prevê também incentivar crianças, especialmente
as provenientes de famílias carentes, a ter uma vida melhor, e uma consciência
ambiental que as transforme em adultos admiráveis. A Santik Bio ActiveWear vai
contemplar ONGS e projetos sociais em que crianças, especialmente aquelas mais
carentes, são incentivadas a praticar esportes.</p>
<p>Esse é o futuro! Queremos
servir de exemplo para que mais e mais marcas de roupas pelo mundo adotem esta
e outras políticas que foquem a melhoria não só da imagem da marca, mas da vida
dos consumidores, dos trabalhadores da indústria da moda e também do meio
ambiente que nos cerca.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>O que eu ganho apoiando o projeto?
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Buy one, Give one!</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Para cada peça
confeccionada e vendida aqui, a Santik produzirá, em paralelo, uma peça infantil, que será
doada como uniforme para ONGs que tenham por foco incentivar crianças menos
privilegiadas 
<b><span>socioeconomicamente
</span></b>
 a praticar esportes. Camisetas,
calças, tops, bermudas ciclistas, entre outros, farão com que
essas crianças finalmente tenham identidade de grupo, de time, reforçando cada
vez mais a ideia de que todos juntos podemos criar um futuro melhor.</h4>
<br/><p></p>
<h4>Se você ainda se
pergunta: “Por que eu devo contribuir para esse projeto “sair do papel” e se
tornar realidade?” </h4>
<p>Porque este
projeto não é só meu, e foi por isso que eu escolhi a plataforma de <i>crowdfunding</i>. A ideia inicial foi minha,
mas o projeto visa ao bem estar do planeta, das pessoas envolvidas na produção,
dos consumidores que usarão essas peças e das crianças carentes beneficiadas. É
um ciclo virtuoso, no qual todos saem ganhando. Você ajuda muita gente e também
se beneficia, como habitante do planeta.</p>
<p>As crianças são o
nosso futuro. Vamos ajudá-las a ter atitudes que ajudem o nosso país a vencer
a guerra contra o desmatamento, a poluição e a falta de respeito para com o
próximo e a natureza.<br/></p>
<p>A hora é agora!<br/>As Olimpíadas estão a caminho!<br/>Vamos, juntos, construir um mundo mais
saudável com uma qualidade de vida melhor para cada um de nós.</p>
<p>O Brasil merece! E o planeta agradece!</p>
<h3>Outras formas de contribuir para o projeto</h3>
<p>Se você não pode doar seu dinheiro, doe seu tempo! Curta, compartilhe, divulgue, convide seus amigos para também participarem dessa iniciativa! Vamos espalhar a notícia, que em meio a tantas notícias tristes pelo mundo, ainda há esperança de fazer um futuro melhor, e ele começa AGORA!!</p>

<h2><b>Introducing - Urban Shield Protective Hoodie</b></h2>
<p>We want to protect <strong>everyone</strong> from <strong>Crimes</strong> that involve Electronic Control Devices or Stun Guns and <strong>health</strong> concerns related to Electrosmog (ESmog) and Electrostatic discharge (ESD) using our <strong>patented</strong> technology.</p>
<p>The <strong>Urban Shield protective Hoodie</strong> has the same look and great feel of a standard hoodie being provided in the market today.  </p>
<p>The big difference is that we provide <strong>protection</strong> which is developed into the fabric that is used to make the garment.  </p>
<p><strong>You will not see or feel any difference!</strong></p>
<h3>The protection areas:</h3>
<p><strong>Electronic Control Devices (ECD) or Stun Guns </strong>- is a device designed to stun or immobilize an attacker by administering an electric shock. When an ECD  is activated (usually by pulling a trigger), electricity passes between two metal prongs at the end of the weapon. Touching these electrified prongs against an attacker causes sharp pain.</p>
<p>There are <strong>millions</strong> of ECD's produced each year. They are produced in a multitude of designs ranging from cell phone cases, batons, cell phones, hand held devices, shields, pens and more. The voltages range from <strong>1000's to millions</strong> of volts.  Each year scores of people are subject to crimes using stun guns.</p>
<p><strong>For example, in the UK</strong> - The number of ECD's seized at the UK border has risen<strong> 70% </strong>in 4 years.  ECD's are <strong>increasingly the weapon of choice for criminals and gangs</strong> who find it hard to get real guns in the UK. There was a crime in the UK where, Nathan Matthews took a kidnap kit, which included an ECD disguised as torches, when he went to the home of his teenage stepsister Becky Watts and murdered her last year. </p>

This trendy modular detachable footwear has since paved the way to bigger ideas. Now, not only can you replace your shoes by parts, but you can even customise the design and choose the type of fabrics of the shoe to reflect your individual personality; effortlessly.</span></p><p>As a sports enthusiast, having to lug around different set of shoes for different sport activities quite a hassle. The brilliant thing is, Shoebloxx can solve this problem too. Designed from the ground-up, ShoeBloxx is a unique three piece detachable shoe that is easy to use and allows you to switch or combine different type of outsoles to suit different types of activities anytime, anywhere.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p><div>

<br/>
</div><div>
<h3><b>Value Proposition:</b></h3>
<p>ShoeBloxx is made in such a way that the upper part of the shoe (uppers) and the rubber bottom (outsole) could be detach from each other. With the shoes ability to be detachable, it opens up to a variety of possibilities that a normal shoe can't do, for example :</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Reduce ‘Wear &amp; Tear’</p></li>
<li><p>Machine Washable</p></li>
<li><p>Space-Saving</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to buy in ‘parts’</p></li>
<li><p>Recycle Friendly</p></li>
<li><p>Create Your Own Design</p></li>
</ol>
<div><br/></div>
<p>More importantly, ShoeBloxx is a shoe and an art canvas combined. As the upper can be detach form the bottom sole, it could then be flatten, transforming it into a canvas where you can create your own design on them and have a completely customised shoe made by YOU! So as you buy the shoe, you also get to bring out your creative side as well.</p>
<p>You want your kids to use ShoeBloxx because not only will it benefit them in solving the most common problems related to footwear, but it will also allow them to express their unique individual creativity plus developing their spatial creativity in the process.</p>

<br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Creating  modular shoes with design focused values that can withstand a users everyday movements will not be easy. We are a very small startup without enough people and money to accomplish this on our own. Thanks to our many supporters who have enthusiastically contributed to taking on this challenge, however, we have reached a point at which we are confident we will be able to manufacture ShoeBloxx on a medium scale provided we can raise enough funds.</p>

<p>At present we have produced our fourth prototype shoe and completed our basic activity based application, and we have also fabricated custom soles to hold the uppers designed by a engaging an established 3D printing agency. As long as we don’t run into problems with durability or the production process the current prototype models are ready to be turned into shoes we can ship to backers.</p>
<p>The first hurdle we will have to overcome in manufacturing ShoeBloxx shoes is the fabrication of metal moulds for the custom soles needed to hold the separate components. This is expensive, and new moulds must be made for each size of shoe. As a result, even if we meet our minimum funding goal we won't necessarily be able to produce a satisfactory range of sizes. We will decide what sizes to produce based on the level of funding we receive and then send backers the one best suited to their measurements. We may run into difficulties that will delay shipment of our product. We will post regular updates to keep backers informed of our progress and respond to comments and questions as quickly as we can.</p>

Would you like to own a pair of ‪trendy detachable shoe called #‎ShoeBloxx‬ or get your whole family on-board? You can be the first to own this trendy, fun and revolutionary footwear today. Finally there's a reason for you to  discover and express your unlimited creativity and make each shoe uniquely yours!ShoeBloxx detachable shoe concept.ShoeBloxx was initially created in 2013 to tackle the carbon footprint issue (pun intended) by creating shoes that can be replaced by individual parts, should it get worn out. This trendy modular detachable footwear has since paved the way to bigger ideas. Now, not only can you replace your shoes by parts, but you can even customise the design and choose the type of fabrics of the shoe to reflect your individual personality; effortlessly.As a sports enthusiast, having to lug around different set of shoes for different sport activities quite a hassle. The brilliant thing is, Shoebloxx can solve this problem too. Designed from the ground-up, ShoeBloxx is a unique three piece detachable shoe that is easy to use and allows you to switch or combine different type of outsoles to suit different types of activities anytime, anywhere.
Trendy modular footwear - Fun & easy to use.


Value Proposition:
ShoeBloxx is made in such a way that the upper part of the shoe (uppers) and the rubber bottom (outsole) could be detach from each other. With the shoes ability to be detachable, it opens up to a variety of possibilities that a normal shoe can't do, for example :

Reduce ‘Wear & Tear’
Machine Washable
Space-Saving
Ability to buy in ‘parts’
Recycle Friendly
Create Your Own Design


More importantly, ShoeBloxx is a shoe and an art canvas combined. As the upper can be detach form the bottom sole, it could then be flatten, transforming it into a canvas where you can create your own design on them and have a completely customised shoe made by YOU! So as you buy the shoe, you also get to bring out your creative side as well.
You want your kids to use ShoeBloxx because not only will it benefit them in solving the most common problems related to footwear, but it will also allow them to express their unique individual creativity plus developing their spatial creativity in the process.
One shoe, infinite possibilities - Multi layered design system.
