<p>My name is Anna.
I have graduated from the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga as a Bachelor
of Economics and Business Administration and have worked in advertising
industry for several years. After that I have been engaged in several
independent projects and have successfully established my own business. Since that I have also worked as a VJ and electronic music video
director. </p>
<p>I have come up
with an idea to publish a book of flyers when I was sorting old things, like
books, notebooks etc., out  and found a collection of flyers for
electronic music events that took place in Latvia. All of them had a very
distinct design and reminded of the events they were created for. At that
moment I have realised that flyers were playing inalienable part in every
electronic music event and now are a great example of graphic design of the
90s - 00s. They also serve as a reference to Latvian electronic music
culture of that period. </p>
<p>Flyers are not
as widespread as were at those days now. They have been mainly substituted by
electronic ""flyers"". The collections of people who have given their paper
flyers for scanning amount to about 1000 pieces. All of them have been scanned
by now.</p>
<p>The goal of this,
second, fundraising campaign is to collect 900 Euro for the digital preparation
of material for design and designing the book. This second step of the project
assumes the work with the graphic designer, who will be in charge of the final look
of the book. </p>
<p>For each
contribution of 30 Euro (delivery worldwide, postal expenses included)<span>  or 18 Euro (book is to be picked up in
Riga) you will get a great book of flyers. <br/></span></p><p><span>No strict deadlines — the project can

<p>NOTE:  Charms have been ordered!  I'd love to hit that goal though so I get back the extra fees and earn a profit!</p><p>Welcome to my
Indiegogo!  I'm a stay at home
mom/illustrator who does a lot of comics.  (If you've already read through this, scroll to the bottom for MORE charm selections of charms I've already made!)</p>
<p> It's been awhile since I made a charm run due
to the company I was using closing and being unsure about new offerings, but
I've decided to make a go at it RIGHT NOW!  (Because Backerkit is running a special and so is Zap, which I'll be able to take advantage of if I get the funds by January 2nd.)</p>
<p>I'm plotting to do a
run of charms with a different company, Zap Creatives in the UK this time.  (I have a second company I'll try out next
time here in Texas.)  They offer a wide
variety of charm types and I'm taking advantage of it.</p>
<p>Each charm will be
printed on thick acrylic, like my prior ones, but unlike prior ones, I'm opting
for metallic gold, so a few of them will show through, #1, #2, #3, and #4.  They'll all be printed on the same
background, but it won't have any effect on the printing itself, just on any
open spots.  I was going to print #5 and #6 on the same background, but then noticed the option for clear acrylic, so I'm going to go with that so they are all ICY!</p>
<p>Charms 1 through 3

let me know which characters you would like to see and if I get a few requests
for the same character, I'll make more.</p><p>Please tell me which charms you want so I can track the numbers.  Any charms not wanted will be replaced after a week up.</p>
<p>Charms will come
with your choice of attachment, key chain loop, cellphone strap, cellphone

switched to a lightweight colorful aluminum ring that is easier to deal with
than the prior rings I used and sturdier.</p>
<p>International orders

fabricator. For the past three years I have been living at The Cube, an
artspace and venue in Downtown Los Angeles. In that span of time we’ve
collectively produced and hosted a number of art and music shows. We very
rarely have made anything close to a profit on this for ourselves; we do this because
we support the bands and artists. <br/><br/>
Recently we were forced to cancel the lease on our home and artspace of 3
years. Without warning, I found myself faced with the problem of transporting
two large installation artworks from our house to a new location. Luckily,
these large-scale, original works of art have been offered a permanent home at
the East Jesus art compound in Slab
  City California. East
Jesus is an artist compound started by the late Charles Russell, and from my
conversations with him, it was intended to provide a home for this sort of work
in this sort of situation.  East Jesus is home to an outdoor sculpture
garden, open to the public 365 days a year and would be the best place to
exhibit the work for the fact that it is a secure and established space. More
information on East Jesus can be found at <a href=""eastjesus.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">eastjesus.org</a><br/><br/>
Failing to transport this work means that it would have to be destroyed at the
end of the month. </p>
<p>The two works to be

<p>Previously, I moved
three large scale artworks to East Jesus at my own expense and am aware of the
labor and costs that will inevitable go into the endeavor. The quote that I
received for to rent a 24 foot stake bed truck needed is 119 dollars per day
with an additional fee of 59 cents per mile. My expected round trip is 440
miles in 2 days, meaning the cost for the rental would be around $500 plus an
approximate $150 dollars for gasoline. I’ll also need to purchase several
pounds of screws and other hardware (approximately $150 worth) to ensure that
it can be rebuilt on site. With any space left on the truck I’m planning to transport
a half dozen 55 gallon drums full of compost for the garden and a multitude of
other building materials to the site. For your donations I’ll be offering
original artworks and printed materials. Also, Mirabelle Jones will compose  a personal theme song using the power of MIDI technology for all contributors! <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Check out the perks list for other details!</span><br/><br/>
Here’s a list of the costs:<br/><br/>
Truck rental for two days: $238<br/>
Mileage for 440 miles:  $259.60<br/>
Gasoline costs: $150<br/>
Fasteners, screws, etc: $150<br/>
55 gallon drums x6: $36<br/>
Compost: Free<br/>
Additional Building Materials (Pallets, found lumber): Free<br/><br/>
This will be a very cost effective project for the amount of new installations
and materials that East Jesus will be receiving. With the large stake bed truck
we’ll easily be able to fit all of this, and the hydraulic lift gate will save
us a significant amount of labor. </p>
<p><br/>
I’m hoping to raise 1000 dollars to have a slight contingency over the expected
costs after all the fees get assessed, though any funds not used on transportation and reassembly costs will go
into other building materials for East Jesus as well as the operations budget.
Things that are in constant demand out there include portland cement and
mortar, caulk, screws, lumber, diesel fuel and water.</p>
<p>If you’re not able
to help with costs I definitely need help with loading, unloading, and
rebuilding the installations. Also, as I’ll have a very large truck, additional
materials could be transported to the site, so if you have materials to
contribute that would also be a huge benefit! Another way to help would be to
spread the message. <br/><br/>
It’s been a great three years at The Cube, and I’m really happy that folks have
worked as hard as they have to keep East Jesus alive after Charlie passed. For
all of that I am extremely thankful. This project is the end of a chapter, but
with your contribution it can be the continuation of another. For that, I thank
you! <br/><br/>DO BIG FUN!<br/>MAKE GOOD THING!</p><p></p><p></p></div>","I'm Joe Holliday, an installation artist and
fabricator. For the past three years I have been living at The Cube, an
artspace and venue in Downtown Los Angeles. In that span of time we’ve
collectively produced and hosted a number of art and music shows. We very
rarely have made anything close to a profit on this for ourselves; we do this because
we support the bands and artists. 
Recently we were forced to cancel the lease on our home and artspace of 3
years. Without warning, I found myself faced with the problem of transporting
two large installation artworks from our house to a new location. Luckily,
these large-scale, original works of art have been offered a permanent home at
the East Jesus art compound in Slab
  City California. East
Jesus is an artist compound started by the late Charles Russell, and from my
conversations with him, it was intended to provide a home for this sort of work
in this sort of situation.  East Jesus is home to an outdoor sculpture
garden, open to the public 365 days a year and would be the best place to
exhibit the work for the fact that it is a secure and established space. More
information on East Jesus can be found at eastjesus.org
Failing to transport this work means that it would have to be destroyed at the
end of the month. 
The two works to be
transported are both reclaimed wooden structures. One is a collaborative
architectural collage between myself and fellow artist Mirabelle Jones, titled

<p>KEEP OUR LYONS ARTISTS IN LYONS!</p>
<p>Art Pharm is a revolutionary program for Lyons that combines the highly successful model of business incubation and the creative talents of Lyons's artists to develop a community of artists and art teachers. The Art Pharm program provides unparalleled support for Lyons artists for the creation and sales of art with the goal of increasing artists' income to be able to afford to live and work in Lyons, Colorado.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Art Pharm is presently in the process of getting our non-profit 501(c)(3) status but we need our community's help in the meantime for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Art Class Supplies</li>
<li>General Overhead</li>
<li>Non-profit fees and staff to get the grant writing process started.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The mission of the Art Pharm is to provide affordable studio, gallery, and workshop space on Main Street for our Lyons artists. </p>
<ul>
<li>to create an environment where Lyons artists may explore, create and communicate their craft in a supportive and nurturing environment; </li>
<li>to provide educational experiences to students of all ages with a special emphasis on programming for Elementary - High School students.</li>
<li>to present artwork by local artists in an effort to sell their work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Arts improve individual well-being. 69 percent of the population believe the arts “lift me up beyond everyday experiences,” 73 percent feel the arts give them “pure pleasure to experience and participate in,” and 81 percent say the arts are a “positive experience in a troubled world.”</li>
<li>Arts unify communities. 72 percent of Americans believe “the arts unify our communities regardless of age, race, and ethnicity” and 73 percent agree that the arts “helps me understand other cultures better”—a perspective observed across all demographic and economic categories.</li>
<li>Arts improve academic performance. Students engaged in arts learning have higher GPAs, standardized test scores, and college-going rates as well as lower drop-out rates. These academic benefits are reaped by students regardless of socio-economic status. Yet, the Department of Education reports that access to arts education for students of color is significantly lower than for their white peers. 91 percent of Americans believe that arts are part of a well-rounded K-12 education.</li>
<li>Arts strengthen the economy. The production of all arts and cultural goods in the U.S. (e.g., nonprofit, commercial, education) added $804 billion to the economy in 2016, including a $25 billion international trade surplus—a larger share of the nation’s economy (4.3 percent) than transportation, tourism, and agriculture (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis). The nonprofit arts industry alone generates $166.3 billion in economic activity annually—spending by organizations and their audiences—which supports 4.6 million jobs and generates $27.5 billion in government revenue.</li>
<li>Arts drive tourism and revenue to local businesses. Attendees at nonprofit arts events spend $31.47 per person, per event, beyond the cost of admission on items such as meals, parking, and babysitters—valuable commerce for local businesses. 34 percent of attendees live outside the county in which the arts event takes place; they average $47.57 in event-related spending. Arts travelers are ideal tourists, staying longer and spending more to seek out authentic cultural experiences.</li>
<li>Arts spark creativity and innovation. Creativity is among the top 5 applied skills sought by business leaders, per the Conference Board’s Ready to Innovate report—with 72 percent saying creativity is of high importance when hiring. Research on creativity shows that Nobel laureates in the sciences are 17 times more likely to be actively engaged in the arts than other scientists.</li>
<li>Arts drive the creative industries. The Creative Industries are arts businesses that range from nonprofit museums, symphonies, and theaters to for-profit film, architecture, and design companies. A 2017 analysis of Dun &amp; Bradstreet data counts 673,656 businesses in the U.S. involved in the creation or distribution of the arts—4.01 percent of all businesses and 2.04 percent of all employees. (Get a free local Creative Industry report for your community here.)</li>
<li>Arts have social impact. University of Pennsylvania researchers have demonstrated that a high concentration of the arts in a city leads to higher civic engagement, more social cohesion, higher child welfare, and lower poverty rates.</li>
<li>Arts improve healthcare. Nearly one-half of the nation’s healthcare institutions provide arts programming for patients, families, and even staff. 78 percent deliver these programs because of their healing benefits to patients—shorter hospital stays, better pain management, and less medication.</li>
<li>Arts for the health and well-being of our military. The arts heal the mental, physical, and moral injuries of war for military servicemembers and Veterans, who rank the creative arts therapies in the top 4 (out of 40) interventions and treatments. Across the military continuum, the arts promote resilience during pre-deployment, deployment, and the reintegration of military servicemembers, Veterans, their families, and caregivers into communities.</li>

 As a society we have just started to

and the barrier of ""traditional"" family as the only acceptable norm
has finally been broken. I also want to hear from my subjects in their own
voice. I want to record their stories, which include those at the beginning of their

<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">This is a work in progress. I have been
researching and meeting awesome alternative families since before my son was
born. My journey to motherhood started in the early 90's when I was about 33
years old. I met Sarah, a single mom by choice living in a suburban </span>neighborhood<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""> in Miami.
What really made an impact was how ordinary their life was. She introduced me to another single mom by choice and from there my journey started. It took another 12 years for my time to come but it has all been worth it. I would like to show my son and other children their parents journey through this project.</span><br/></p>

I want to be able to photograph and chronicle some of the more unique as well as the ordinary non traditional families to make sure that future generations know  that gender, religion, race or whatever stigma can never get in the way of Nurture. Family has truly had a radical evolution in this millennium and I want to celebrate this momentum visually. </span></p>About a year after meeting Sarah, I got a call from a mom who
booked me to photograph her newborn. When I arrived at her home, her partner
and the grandmothers were also present for the shoot. Another confirmation that
there was an alternative to the traditional and that family would support their
choices.<p></p>

studied a Kabbalah for years and through this spiritual journey I came to
believe that I was capable of parenting on my own. At this time Madonna and
Rosie had already opened up the conversation about alternative families and
parenting.  Another woman (and also a celebrity)I met  through my spiritual studies embarked on her journey to motherhood through in-vitro. I was lucky to witness the process through pregnancy to the little angel above I photographed one day when we were hanging with friends. Sandra was getting so much press at the time that I didn't want to be so invasive and ask her to be another subject. I am hoping through this crowd funding to be able to reach out to some public figures that have chosen alternative families. <p></p>

<p>Single moms by choice are abundant these days,
especially in urban areas. In-vitro has made it possible for all types of
caring adults to become parents and most countries that let Americans adopt
don't care if you’re single or married. Gender, race, religion are no longer factors to creating happy well adjusted families.</p>

</div></div>","CONCEPTION, A multi media series that about conceiving a family in this millenium.
This is a creative, social and personal
project. 
Socially
this series will show that a family is simply about sharing love and nurturing.
 As a society we have just started to
accept that any configuration of an adult and child (children) is ""family”
and the barrier of ""traditional"" family as the only acceptable norm
has finally been broken. I also want to hear from my subjects in their own
voice. I want to record their stories, which include those at the beginning of their
journey to those millennial children whose parents were brave enough to choose
alternatives before straying from the “norm” became aceptable..  
As an award winning lifestyle photographer I want to capture heartfelt images of relationships in all the different types of families within their own environment.  Inspiring the viewer to see the amazing choices they can have in this era.
On the personal note, on Christmas Day 2002 my son was born and a lifelong dream of becoming a mom was fulfilled. This dream did not exactly conform to society's idea of how to become a parent and I went through the process of adoption completely on my own with little support from my family.Click here to read a bit more about my story.""How a Mommy was Born"".
The Images in this piece are just documenting the unique families I have encountered on my journey to become a family as a single mother by choice and through my professional career. I need to raise production costs to complete a visually and important body of work that will document through both motion and photography all different alternatives there are to conceiving a  the way families are conceived in this millenium.

This is a work in progress. I have been
researching and meeting awesome alternative families since before my son was
born. My journey to motherhood started in the early 90's when I was about 33
years old. I met Sarah, a single mom by choice living in a suburban neighborhood in Miami.
What really made an impact was how ordinary their life was. She introduced me to another single mom by choice and from there my journey started. It took another 12 years for my time to come but it has all been worth it. I would like to show my son and other children their parents journey through this project.

Through my career as a fine art portrait artist shooting private commissions  and as a lifestyle photographer  working on numerous advertising and editorial assignments, I have been lucky enough to meet all sorts of families. I want to be able to photograph and chronicle some of the more unique as well as the ordinary non traditional families to make sure that future generations know  that gender, religion, race or whatever stigma can never get in the way of Nurture. Family has truly had a radical evolution in this millennium and I want to celebrate this momentum visually. About a year after meeting Sarah, I got a call from a mom who
booked me to photograph her newborn. When I arrived at her home, her partner
and the grandmothers were also present for the shoot. Another confirmation that
there was an alternative to the traditional and that family would support their
choices.

Susan and Debra have since had another
daughter. One is the biological mother of both girls and the other is the
physical mom. Both are fun loving, great parents to two beautiful well adjusted
daughters.



I
studied a Kabbalah for years and through this spiritual journey I came to
believe that I was capable of parenting on my own. At this time Madonna and
Rosie had already opened up the conversation about alternative families and
parenting.  Another woman (and also a celebrity)I met  through my spiritual studies embarked on her journey to motherhood through in-vitro. I was lucky to witness the process through pregnancy to the little angel above I photographed one day when we were hanging with friends. Sandra was getting so much press at the time that I didn't want to be so invasive and ask her to be another subject. I am hoping through this crowd funding to be able to reach out to some public figures that have chosen alternative families. 



When my son was born
I joined a mothering group and I met a really great maternal dad who was the
primary caregiver to a set of twins. His partner and him are each the
biological father to one of the twins. It seemed that the eggs they both fertilized and
implanted in the surrogate produced two children who were born as twins but
were actually 1/2 siblings!  A truly magical accident that is both fulfilling and unique. 

Jodie was another client who actually booked me shortly after losing her husband in 9/11. She simply wanted to chronicle her love for their daughter and send holiday cards out to reassure her family and friends that they were doing OK. Single motherhood was initially thrust on her through tragedy but society had accepted her status and given her the perseverance create the family she always dreamed of. She had twin boys a few years later through in-vitro and feels her family is now complete.



Single moms by choice are abundant these days,
especially in urban areas. In-vitro has made it possible for all types of
caring adults to become parents and most countries that let Americans adopt
don't care if you’re single or married. Gender, race, religion are no longer factors to creating happy well adjusted families.




My goal is to travel to rural, country, suburban and urban areas throughout the United States so that no matter who or where you are, you will identify with my subjects. This series will inspire those that want to start the journey of becoming a family and educate those have already chosen one of the many alternatives to the traditional. This visual will be one more catalyst to inspire acceptance of all gender, racial, religious and social configurations of “Family”.




Funding for this project will include  a  producer, cameraman, editor, research assistant, picture editor, proof reader (I really need this - I am sure there are many typos in this piece) and other crew members. I need hard drives an archivist and equipment to coordinate time and support in order to concentrate on producing stellar body of work. 
I also need funding for , travel, time and fabrication the final images for a gallery show, documentary video and/or a coffee table book. 

I would like to work with a curator and/or a gallery,
publisher and/or agent to help with this project so please spread the word to any connections you might have in the industry.  
 I have wanted to do this project for years but I needed to dedicate my time to making a living and now feel that the time has come to create this piece. Please share this with friends and family through social media, email, personal pleas and whatever form of networking you use to connect.

My name is Ronnie J Packe, I'm 20-year-old artist and craftsperson currently living in a rural town in Maryland. I've been into art my whole life, from painting and illustration to crafting and print-making. While I am mostly self-taught, I took an AP art class in my senior year of high school, studied under a few local artists and craftspeople, and attended a short summer art course at a local community college. Last year, I pulled all of my work under a collective label that I call <a href=""http://witchmoss.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">witchmoss</a>, and under that name I sell my works, which include illustrations and hand crafted jewelry. I hope to one day expand to sell more of my own creations, but to also work and collaborate with other like-minded artists, and provide spaces for artists and art enthusiasts to gather, learn, and create together.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/421753/files/20140309093310-indiegogoshowoff.png?1394382790"" src="""" style=""width: 601.693px; height: 305px;""/></p><br/><h3>Why Portland?<br/>

In Portland, and especially the surrounding areas, there is hardly a disconnect from nature- unlike other cities where trees are confined to sidewalk decorations, and a ""park"" is just a plot of grass.

<br/><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The History of BECA</span><br/>
</div>
<p>For the past 3 years, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">BECA: Bridge for Emerging Contemporary Art</span>, a non-profit, international public arts programming project, has been developing opportunities for both emerging creative producers as well as the participating public via both physical and online formats. BECA has grown an initial network of a couple of hundred people into network that now encompasses an estimated 32,000 members of the local, national and international art + design communities.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The basic formula has been kept simple</span>...emerging creative producers and the public tell us what they want in benefits, opportunities and programming, we listen and then we do our best to deliver.  We serve in this capacity because each time a talented artist or other creative producer gets shut out of the traditional art world party, we, as a society, lose out.  Our collective futures suffer when emerging talent gives up due to the lack of perceived value and adequate support and opportunities not provided to them along the way. BECA has a mission to plug the holes and fill the gaps in the sometimes archaic art world and other similar systems and deliver opportunities to emerging creative producers that support progress, possibility and innovation toward a tolerant, healthy, just and sustainable future for all.  We do not have all of the answers and probably never will.  <br/>We attempt to provide a few alternatives and we’ve enjoyed promising results thus far.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Driven by our core belief that 'New Art + New Design Fuels the Best of What's Yet to Come on This Planet'</span>, we've taken stock in what we've learned over the past recent years and are creating a finely tuned long term plan for BECA international public arts programming.  The daily feedback we receive from artists + designers and the public who are engaged in our programming (along with short-term and long-term professional advisors we have been so fortunate to learn from) has been, and will continue to be, invaluable to us. <br/><br/>Even though at some points over the past 3 years our open experiment seemed counter-intuitive to how most planned arts programming achieves success, it has been a necessary prelude for the next steps in this project.  We’ve had to allow for mistakes to be made, lessons to be learned and research to be conducted.  BECA, as it is today, was not planned to be what is has become nor did we consciously plan to invest 3 years of our lives as non-paid volunteer directors.  Sometimes the most important things in life are much larger than the self and these dictate what transpires in our personal lives.  If we are lucky, we listen and then get down to the business at hand.<br/><br/></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">BECA ICAD</span><br/>
</div>
<p>As we now enter our 4th year, we expect to continue to allow for experimentation but we will take the lessons learned, feedback received and advice given to the next level and move forward with a very important next step in facilitating expanded benefits and opportunities for artists, designers and the public. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">This next step is to establish the world's first large scale facility and multicultural international platform for the exhibition of new works by both emerging artists + designers as well as other creative producers from around the world.</span>  Someone recently termed the next steps as a United Nations of emerging art + design.  A friend recently referred to BECA as a social justice organization creating an international platform giving voice to creative producers from around the world without regard to whom they know or where they came from.  We think both are fitting but what’s most important to remember as we move into 2011 is that emerging creative producers not only deserve our support but that progress and possibility in our futures depend on them succeeding.<br/><br/>We are launching the first phase of our fundraising campaign with the goal of reaching $10,000 (with the hopes of going beyond our set target and reaching $50,000) within the next 30 days. We have several ways of expressing our sincere gratitude for your partnership and support as revealed in the right-hand column of this campaign page.

The BECA Foundation is creating an important component currently missing in the worlds of art + design yet long needed by artists and designers and the global public who benefit from their new art, new design and new ideas...establishment of the world's first large
scale facility and multicultural international platform dedicated to the
exhibition of new works by both emerging artists + designers as well as
other emerging creative producers from around the world.  The multi-cultural exhibition facility, named BECA ICAD (International Center for Art + Design),
will showcase future forward works and new innovations from around the
world from an interdisciplinary array of emerging talent in the visual
arts, performing arts, music and literary arts - film, video and new
media - architecture and graphic, industrial, fashion and interactive
design as well as from science and the culinary arts. BECA
ICAD is being envisioned as a type of United Nations of emerging art +
design with different regions of the world featured in an ever-evolving
format. 


The History of BECA

For the past 3 years, BECA: Bridge for Emerging Contemporary Art, a non-profit, international public arts programming project, has been developing opportunities for both emerging creative producers as well as the participating public via both physical and online formats. BECA has grown an initial network of a couple of hundred people into network that now encompasses an estimated 32,000 members of the local, national and international art + design communities.The basic formula has been kept simple...emerging creative producers and the public tell us what they want in benefits, opportunities and programming, we listen and then we do our best to deliver.  We serve in this capacity because each time a talented artist or other creative producer gets shut out of the traditional art world party, we, as a society, lose out.  Our collective futures suffer when emerging talent gives up due to the lack of perceived value and adequate support and opportunities not provided to them along the way. BECA has a mission to plug the holes and fill the gaps in the sometimes archaic art world and other similar systems and deliver opportunities to emerging creative producers that support progress, possibility and innovation toward a tolerant, healthy, just and sustainable future for all.  We do not have all of the answers and probably never will.  We attempt to provide a few alternatives and we’ve enjoyed promising results thus far.Driven by our core belief that 'New Art + New Design Fuels the Best of What's Yet to Come on This Planet', we've taken stock in what we've learned over the past recent years and are creating a finely tuned long term plan for BECA international public arts programming.  The daily feedback we receive from artists + designers and the public who are engaged in our programming (along with short-term and long-term professional advisors we have been so fortunate to learn from) has been, and will continue to be, invaluable to us. Even though at some points over the past 3 years our open experiment seemed counter-intuitive to how most planned arts programming achieves success, it has been a necessary prelude for the next steps in this project.  We’ve had to allow for mistakes to be made, lessons to be learned and research to be conducted.  BECA, as it is today, was not planned to be what is has become nor did we consciously plan to invest 3 years of our lives as non-paid volunteer directors.  Sometimes the most important things in life are much larger than the self and these dictate what transpires in our personal lives.  If we are lucky, we listen and then get down to the business at hand.

BECA ICAD

As we now enter our 4th year, we expect to continue to allow for experimentation but we will take the lessons learned, feedback received and advice given to the next level and move forward with a very important next step in facilitating expanded benefits and opportunities for artists, designers and the public. This next step is to establish the world's first large scale facility and multicultural international platform for the exhibition of new works by both emerging artists + designers as well as other creative producers from around the world.  Someone recently termed the next steps as a United Nations of emerging art + design.  A friend recently referred to BECA as a social justice organization creating an international platform giving voice to creative producers from around the world without regard to whom they know or where they came from.  We think both are fitting but what’s most important to remember as we move into 2011 is that emerging creative producers not only deserve our support but that progress and possibility in our futures depend on them succeeding.We are launching the first phase of our fundraising campaign with the goal of reaching $10,000 (with the hopes of going beyond our set target and reaching $50,000) within the next 30 days. We have several ways of expressing our sincere gratitude for your partnership and support as revealed in the right-hand column of this campaign page. We thank you in advance for your contribution and for helping us to spread the word about the BECA ICAD project.  To date BECA has assisted approximately 300
emerging artists + designers and we've only just begun!  You may view current and also an archive of past exhibitions and projects at www.BECAICAD.org, www.CurateThis.org and www.BECAgallery.comThank you for supporting the facilitation and growth of New Art + New Design + New Ideas!Melissa Roberts and Kurt Schlough, Co-Founders/DirectorsBECA: Bridge for Emerging Contemporary Art

<h3>About OperaWorks52 &amp; Mother King</h3>
<p>The goal of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/operaworks52/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OperaWorks 52</a> is to change everything you think about when you think of the word ""opera"", the plural of the Latin word opus which means ""work"". We highlight overlooked narratives: the stories of people of color and Native people; of women; of LGBTQ people; the mythologies, truths, and legends of non-European cultures; and a future that is much brighter and inclusive than we have yet to see. We stretch the walls of opera into an elasticity that will never return to its former shape; it will challenge the status quo. To OperaWorks 52, the word opera is not confining; it is boundless.</p>
<p>Mother King is our debut opera project and, after a lot of hard work, we are nearly ready to stage it. We have an ensemble. We have a cast, including Liz Gre, Sarah Greer, Roland Hawkins, Kevin Kaoz Moore, Ava McFarlane, and Michael McDowell. We are honored to have Mischa Santora as our guest conductor, Mackenzie Owens who made the promotional art, and Miko Simmons on site each night of performance to create artistic projections in our space. We have a venue, thanks to a valued partnership with Public Functionary. We have an initial round of financial backing from generous donors in the community. Now, we're back to ask for more help.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Landon Wilson; I am an undergraduate student at the Hartford Art School.  The 24 graduating seniors in the Illustration department, including myself, are raising money for our senior exhibition.  After four years of all-nighters drawing, studying, and painting we are ready to put on the show to end all shows!  The apocalypse is upon us and we are ready to show you what it will look like in our exhibition entitled <em>Epilogue</em>!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h2><strong>@ Kathmandu International Art Festival 2012</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>beinghuman is a cross discipline, media &amp; arts collective that supports fair trade in the arts, working with artists who create art for a more positive, peaceful world.  </strong></h3>
<h3>
<strong>beinghuman's director: artist, film maker &amp; campaigner Gaynor O'Flynn, </strong><strong>needs your help to take the collective to work at this year’s Kathmandu International Art Festival, a not for profit event for social change through the arts.</strong>
</h3>
<h3>
<strong>The artist’s supporting the event have donated their time &amp; work for free but we need to raise $10,000 for travel, </strong><strong>expenses &amp; </strong><strong>production costs. We will be working, collaborating, teaching &amp; creating new work with local artists from the Nepalese &amp; Tibetan Community in Exile.</strong>
</h3>
<h2><strong>You can help for just $1!</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Your name will be projected onto Boudhanath Stupa as part of our interactive, installation art work during Kathmandu International Art Festival! Creating good karma for you and others for aeons to come!</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>You can also buy great art : mp3, ebook, t shirt or limited edition </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>We also have unique art experiences including actually coming wth beinghuman on this trip of a lifetime.</strong></h3>
<h2><strong><a href=""http://www.beinghuman.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.beinghuman.com</a></strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>beinghuman Director, artist Gaynor O’Flynn, is curating the British Chapter of the Festival. Over 100 artists from 75 countries will be taking part in the Festival with over 50,000 attending exhibitions, talks &amp; seminars during the not for profit event.</p>
<p>The festival believes in the power of art for social change. Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, half the population lives below the poverty line.</p>

Von einem selbstironischen Streetart-vs-Graffiti-Battle, über politisches Stadttheater, </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">hin zu Workshops und Vorträgen über soziale, städtische und künstlerische Fragestellungen, </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">sowie der Untersuchung neuer urbaner Wirtschaftsmodelle </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">- es gibt viel zu sehen und zu tun.</span></p><p>Die drei Tage Urban Affairs - geplant für den Kunstherbst 2016 in Berlin - finden an drei <span style=""background-color: initial;"">verschiedenen Orten statt, die wir gemeinsam mit Experten, Künstlern und Besuchern kulturell </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">erobern wollen. Neben der temporären Besetzung von städtischen Räumen entwickeln wir mit </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Publikum und Anwohnern Workshops und Konzepte, die sich dem Trend der Gentrifizierung </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">entgegen stellen und das urbane Leben attraktiver machen. Künstlerische Interventionen zur </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Anregung langfristiger Veränderung - das will Urban Affairs.</span></p><p>Urban Affairs ist unser Weckruf für die Stadt: jeder kann den wachsenden Kulturwüsten etwas <span style=""background-color: initial;"">entgegensetzen. Das Festival vermittelt Möglichkeiten für die Reaktivierung von Stadtraum. Drei </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Tage in Berlin regen die Teilnehmer zur Kommunikation mit der eigenen, lokalen Community an - </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">und mit Gleichgesinnten weltweit.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Wir sind natürlich längst in der Planung des Projekts angekommen.

<p><b>The Project</b></p>
<p><b>Urban Affairs 2016 - the workshop edition</b></p>
<p>After two successful festivals in 2008 and 2009, the 2016 workshop edition of Urban <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Affairs explores new shores: It’s larger, more critical, and a wake-up call for the city. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Urban Affairs is not your average art festival: We'll spend three days at the interface </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">of urban art and urban development, treating visitors to a changing schedule of art, </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">social topics, and knowledge-focused activities. From an ironic street art vs. graffiti battle and political </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">urban theater all the way to workshops and lectures on social, urban, and artistic issues, to </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">an exploration of new urban business models – there’s plenty to see and do.</span></p>
<p>Each of the three days of Urban Affairs – set to take place during Berlin’s fall 2016 art season <span style=""background-color: initial;"">– will feature one of three locations, to be culturally conquered by us, together with </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">experts, artists, and visitors. Beyond the temporary occupation of urban spaces, we will </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">ask our audience and locals to join us in developing workshops and concepts that oppose </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">the gentrification trend and help to make urban life more attractive. In the spotlight: artistic </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">interventions that encourage long-term change.</span></p>
<p>Urban Affairs is our wake-up call for the city: Everyone can do something to counter the <span style=""background-color: initial;"">spread of ""cultural deserts"". Here, the festival communicates options for reactivating urban </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">space. Three days in Berlin inspire participants to communicate with their own, local </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">community – and like-minded people around the world.</span></p>
<p><b>Featured in</b></p>
<p>A glance at our media <span style=""background-color: initial;"">coverage tells us that we're on to something. We've appeared in Stern Magazin, Spiegel Online, Der </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Tagesspiegel, Berliner Morgenpost, Berliner Zeitung, and Bild. German-French TV channel </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">arte even made a documentary on the project. And the first two festival editions in 2008 and </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">2009, attracting 10,000 enthusiastic visitors each, added some great word-of-mouth.</span></p>
<p><b>How it works</b></p>
<p>We've made some excellent progress planning Urban Affairs 2016. Now we<span style=""background-color: initial;""> need your help to give the festival the impact it deserves!</span></p>
<p><b>Beyond the workshop edition, Urban Affairs could be described as</b></p>
<p>an urban art festival that transforms the cityscape into an exhibition space, creates temporary <span style=""background-color: initial;"">art spaces in gentrifying areas, and provides impulses for lasting change in the city.</span></p>
<p><b>Urban challenge</b></p>
<p>The main challenge Urban Affairs takes on is the recapture of urban space and the revitalization <span style=""background-color: initial;"">of forgotten or shuttered locations. It’s all about strengthening social participation</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> in the urban context and discussing questions related to the city and community. In this, </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">urban art serves as a translation tool and an access medium to urban issues.</span></p>
<p><b>Situation: now</b></p>
<p>Two successful editions of Urban Affairs in 2008 and 2009 attracted more than 10,000 <span style=""background-color: initial;"">visitors, broad media coverage, and support by the EU and the City of Berlin – </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">underscoring the need for a rematch. In 2009, Urban Affairs revived a former public bath in </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Wedding, which led to the launch of the STATTBAD Berlin art and culture center. STATTBAD </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">hosted countless urban art exhibitions and interdisciplinary projects, gave us </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">plenty of project development experience, and helped us to establish a wide cultural </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">network. These experiences will now power new ideas such as Urban Affairs - and now we need your </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">help!</span></p>
<p>The planning phase of Urban Affairs 2016 – the workshop edition is in full swing. We’ve <span style=""background-color: initial;"">pinpointed three festival locations and topics and are currently selecting the participating </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">artists and urban experts. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>The Urban Affairs workshop edition will look something like this:</b></span></p>
<p><b>Location: TEUFELSBERG / Topic: SPACE / Day: 1</b></p>
<p>Teufelsberg – a former monitoring station from Cold War days – is a fantastic location for <span style=""background-color: initial;"">workshops and a performance on space and new architecture. These are accompanied by guided tours </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">through the many images of the “Art of Living” open-air exhibition.</span></p>
<p><b>Location: MARIENBURG / Topic: PEOPLE / Day: 2</b></p>
<p>The Marienburger Höfe – a former substation in today’s gentrified Prenzlauer Berg – is a media and print<span style=""background-color: initial;""> collective.</span></p>
<p>Here, we invite you to cook together, explore the neighborhood, and put up a good fight: think chopping disco, guided city tours, <span style=""background-color: initial;"">and a street art vs. graffiti battle whose winner will be chosen by kids.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Location: ZK/U / Topic: CITY / Day: 3</b></p>
<p>At the Zentrum für Kunst und Urbanistik (Center for Art and Urbanism, ZK/U) – a former train station – the city is at the center of our explorations. The schedule includes the development of a new hall of fame with live painting, workshops, and a conference on urban knowledge.</p>

Von einem selbstironischen Streetart-vs-Graffiti-Battle, über politisches Stadttheater, hin zu Workshops und Vorträgen über soziale, städtische und künstlerische Fragestellungen, sowie der Untersuchung neuer urbaner Wirtschaftsmodelle - es gibt viel zu sehen und zu tun.Die drei Tage Urban Affairs - geplant für den Kunstherbst 2016 in Berlin - finden an drei verschiedenen Orten statt, die wir gemeinsam mit Experten, Künstlern und Besuchern kulturell erobern wollen. Neben der temporären Besetzung von städtischen Räumen entwickeln wir mit Publikum und Anwohnern Workshops und Konzepte, die sich dem Trend der Gentrifizierung entgegen stellen und das urbane Leben attraktiver machen. Künstlerische Interventionen zur Anregung langfristiger Veränderung - das will Urban Affairs.Urban Affairs ist unser Weckruf für die Stadt: jeder kann den wachsenden Kulturwüsten etwas entgegensetzen. Das Festival vermittelt Möglichkeiten für die Reaktivierung von Stadtraum. Drei Tage in Berlin regen die Teilnehmer zur Kommunikation mit der eigenen, lokalen Community an - und mit Gleichgesinnten weltweit.Wir sind natürlich längst in der Planung des Projekts angekommen. Wir haben Großes vor - was jetzt notwendig ist, um das Festival in der angedachten Größe realisieren zu können, ist Eure Unterstützung!Unterstützer der Kampagne ist smart mit dem Ideenwettbewerb ""smart urban pioneers"". Zum erreichten Funding gibt es von smart bis zu 25.00€ Preisgeld on Top.Featured inDass Urban Affairs zur richtigen Zeit das Richtige plant, zeigt ein Blick auf die Medienresonanz: Unter anderem berichteten bereits das Stern Magazin, Spiegel Online, Der Tagesspiegel, Berliner Morgenpost, Berliner Zeitung und Bild. Der deutsch-französische TV Sender arte strahlte eine Dokumentation über das Projekt aus. Und jeweils 10.000 begeisterte Besucher der ersten beiden Festival Editionen 2008 und 2009 haben einiges an Mund-zu-Mund-Propaganda erreicht.Urban Affairs FeaturesEin urbanes Kunstfestival erobert Stadtraum als Ausstellungsfläche, schafft temporäre Projekträume im Gentrifizierungsgebiet und sorgt für nachhaltige Impulse für Veränderungen im Stadtbild.Urban ChallengeDie Herausforderung von Urban Affairs ist die Rückeroberung urbanen Raums und die Neubelebung von vergessenen oder verschlossenen Orten. Es geht darum, soziale Teilhabe des Einzelnen an der Stadt zu stärken und Fragen rund um Stadt und Gemeinschaft zu diskutieren. Dabei dient die Urbane Kunst als Übersetzungsinstrument und als Zugang zu städtischen Themen.Was bisher geschahUrban Affairs ging bereits 2008 und 2009 erfolgreich an den Start. Über 10.000 Besucher, eine breite Medienberichterstattung und Unterstützung durch die EU und der Stadt Berlin belegen den Erfolg und verlangen nach einer Neuauflage. Urban Affairs extended belebte im Jahr 2009 ein ehemaliges Stadtbad im Wedding und führte zum Aufbau des Kunst- und Kulturzentrums STATTBAD Berlin. Im STATTBAD wurden zahlreiche Urban Art Ausstellungen und interdisziplinäre Projekte realisiert, viel Erfahrungen in der Projektentwicklung gesammelt und ein breites kulturelles Netzwerk aufgebaut. Diese Erfahrungen sollen nun in neue Ideen fließen - Urban Affairs braucht Eure Unterstützung!Die Planung von Urban Affairs 2016 - the workshop edition läuft auf Hochtouren. Drei Festivalorte und Themenschwerpunkte sind gefunden, die Auswahl der Künstler und teilnehmenden Stadtexperten ist im Gange. Das Programm der workshop edition 2016 sieht in etwa so aus:Ort: TEUFELSBERG / Thema: SPACE / Tag: 1Teufelsberg - ein ehemaliger Abhörposten aus der Zeit des kalten KriegesEine großartige Location für Workshops und ein Theaterstück rund um das Thema Raum und neue Architektur. Zudem geführte Touren durch die zahlreichen Bilder der Open-Air Ausstellung „Art of Living“Ort:  MARIENBURG / Thema: PEOPLE / Tag: 2Marienburger Höfe - ein ehemaliges Umspannwerk im heutigen “durchgentrifiziertem” Prenzlauer BergHier wird gemeinsam gekocht, entdeckt und spielerisch gekämpft: Schnippeldisko, geführte Stadttouren und ein streetart vs. graffiti Battle, bei dem die Kinder den Gewinner küren.Ort: ZK/U / Thema: CITY / Tag: 3

The Project
Urban Affairs 2016 - the workshop edition
After two successful festivals in 2008 and 2009, the 2016 workshop edition of Urban Affairs explores new shores: It’s larger, more critical, and a wake-up call for the city. Urban Affairs is not your average art festival: We'll spend three days at the interface of urban art and urban development, treating visitors to a changing schedule of art, social topics, and knowledge-focused activities. From an ironic street art vs. graffiti battle and political urban theater all the way to workshops and lectures on social, urban, and artistic issues, to an exploration of new urban business models – there’s plenty to see and do.
Each of the three days of Urban Affairs – set to take place during Berlin’s fall 2016 art season – will feature one of three locations, to be culturally conquered by us, together with experts, artists, and visitors. Beyond the temporary occupation of urban spaces, we will ask our audience and locals to join us in developing workshops and concepts that oppose the gentrification trend and help to make urban life more attractive. In the spotlight: artistic interventions that encourage long-term change.
Urban Affairs is our wake-up call for the city: Everyone can do something to counter the spread of ""cultural deserts"". Here, the festival communicates options for reactivating urban space. Three days in Berlin inspire participants to communicate with their own, local community – and like-minded people around the world.
Featured in
A glance at our media coverage tells us that we're on to something. We've appeared in Stern Magazin, Spiegel Online, Der Tagesspiegel, Berliner Morgenpost, Berliner Zeitung, and Bild. German-French TV channel arte even made a documentary on the project. And the first two festival editions in 2008 and 2009, attracting 10,000 enthusiastic visitors each, added some great word-of-mouth.
How it works
We've made some excellent progress planning Urban Affairs 2016. Now we need your help to give the festival the impact it deserves!
Beyond the workshop edition, Urban Affairs could be described as
an urban art festival that transforms the cityscape into an exhibition space, creates temporary art spaces in gentrifying areas, and provides impulses for lasting change in the city.
Urban challenge
The main challenge Urban Affairs takes on is the recapture of urban space and the revitalization of forgotten or shuttered locations. It’s all about strengthening social participation in the urban context and discussing questions related to the city and community. In this, urban art serves as a translation tool and an access medium to urban issues.
Situation: now
Two successful editions of Urban Affairs in 2008 and 2009 attracted more than 10,000 visitors, broad media coverage, and support by the EU and the City of Berlin – underscoring the need for a rematch. In 2009, Urban Affairs revived a former public bath in Wedding, which led to the launch of the STATTBAD Berlin art and culture center. STATTBAD hosted countless urban art exhibitions and interdisciplinary projects, gave us plenty of project development experience, and helped us to establish a wide cultural network. These experiences will now power new ideas such as Urban Affairs - and now we need your help!
The planning phase of Urban Affairs 2016 – the workshop edition is in full swing. We’ve pinpointed three festival locations and topics and are currently selecting the participating artists and urban experts. 

The Urban Affairs workshop edition will look something like this:
Location: TEUFELSBERG / Topic: SPACE / Day: 1
Teufelsberg – a former monitoring station from Cold War days – is a fantastic location for workshops and a performance on space and new architecture. These are accompanied by guided tours through the many images of the “Art of Living” open-air exhibition.
Location: MARIENBURG / Topic: PEOPLE / Day: 2
The Marienburger Höfe – a former substation in today’s gentrified Prenzlauer Berg – is a media and print collective.
Here, we invite you to cook together, explore the neighborhood, and put up a good fight: think chopping disco, guided city tours, and a street art vs. graffiti battle whose winner will be chosen by kids.

Location: ZK/U / Topic: CITY / Day: 3
At the Zentrum für Kunst und Urbanistik (Center for Art and Urbanism, ZK/U) – a former train station – the city is at the center of our explorations. The schedule includes the development of a new hall of fame with live painting, workshops, and a conference on urban knowledge.

able to purchase a vintage dining room table and chairs, chandelier, rugs and decorations.
We will be able to rent costumes for the opening night performance. There will
be dinner on the table that night, wine in the glasses and great conversation.
I will be able to hire a videographer and editor for the performance as well as buy a projector that will
project second life clearly onto the screen. I will also be able to pay virtual
rent, costumes, video streaming and a DJ for the extension of the real life
gallery within Second Life. I am also going to be hiring an audio/video
engineer to create a communication/teleconference system which will allow the
real dinner party participants to converse easily with the Second Life dinner
party participants.
The Impact:5 years ago I had no idea how much my life would change. My aunt
and uncle had told me about an online virtual world where I could upload
digital images of my paintings and show them to people who live all over the
world. They were so excited when they met an artist â€˜in personâ€™ and were able
to get to know them. Even when you go to a gallery in the physical world you
rarely find the artist there. 
I initially started showing and selling digital
copies of my paintings in my own gallery. Then I was invited to have shows at
other peopleâ€™s galleries. Within a year, I had made a name for myself and I was
selling 50+ virtual copies of my work a month. I also started to sell the
original paintings to people who saw my work in this virtual world. 
While working on my Masters Degree I explored ideas
of identity and our online representations. It first started on a very personal
level looking into the relationship between myself and my avatar. I then did a
visual study of other peopleâ€™s avatars looking into why they chose to create the
avatars the way they did I took over 2000 portraits to document their diversity
and published the avatar portraits in a 2 volume set.
Second Life is an amazing platform for self
expression, building community, art, music, education, health and so much
more.  I have met with a team at USC who
are helping veterans work through PTSD using avatars that allow them to remain
anonymous. Many of the major Universities hold online classes within Second
Life. Musicians stream music from their home studios into concerts where people
from all over the world are able to attend. And artists have formed communities
where they gather and share their work, critique, exchange ideas and hang out. 
While my paintings are one medium I share in Second
Life, I have come to value Second Life as a medium in itself. Exploring notions
of identity through my own avatar, who is tall, thin and virtually ideal, I
have experienced the amazing potential that virtual worlds offer in helping
others. In my project â€œGracie and the Real Girl,â€ I examine media and societyâ€™s
distortion of beauty, eating disorders, body image and self esteem. 
This show I am creating for May 2012 is going to
help blur the line between the virtual and physical world. It will help bring
attention to the amazing possibilities of this medium. It is my hope, my intent
for people to see how communities can be built, ideas can be exchanged and the
imagination can be expanded beyond the 3rd dimension. 
After this show, I plan on doing more projects,
installations and performances on a more personal level. I want to share our
story with others by continuing the dialogue of mediaâ€™s distortion of beauty
and its impact on so many lives. I am really looking forward to the
opportunities that this show will give me. It has been a rewarding journey in
so many ways. Thank you so much for your support and encouragement.Please help support expression, art and my future:The estimated budget for this project is $10,000. Besides this crowdfunding site I am also applying for grants and using my savings and credit cards to put this
together. So every donation helps out so much. 
Please forward this to your friends and family. Share it on
Facebook, Twitter, Plurk, Google+. I would love and appreciate your help so  much.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

makes all the difference.
I am working on a picture for a special place and need your
help to complete it.
Holy Ghost Parish is a church that was founded in 1953 in a multiethnic neighborhood in Albuquerque. The church has a
school connected to it and is attended by families, retirees, and single
people.  The parish has English and Spanish
masses and hosts a Vietnamese festival during the spring. It is a small
parish. It is located in my neighborhood.
Last fall I donated and installed a statue to the church to
replace statuary that had been vandalized. I often pause in the church to pray
and take in the silence it offers.
My project features a dove, the symbol of the Holy Spirit, and that is the painting I am making to
grace the entrance of the church. It will measure 6 feet by 3 feet.
My design has been approved by the parish council. The rest
is up to donations in order for me to complete the picture.
I am writing to ask you for help. Any donation you
give will be greatly appreciated and will be rewarded.

<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Calibri; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The aim of the <i style="""">Maison l’art en folie de la Reine Soleil</i>
is to provide a safe haven for disadvantaged Haitian children who were
traumatized by the 2010 earthquake as well as other natural catastrophes. Young
survivors’ recovery would be facilitated through various therapeutic opportunities,
particularly through the arts - dance, painting, music, crafts, theatre,
storytelling, traditional games, jump up and more. The main objective of this
initiative is to help children who have experienced trauma to regain a sense of
balance and healing and allow for healthy growth and development.</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Times; font-size: 13px;""> </span><p class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Calibri; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The selected approach is
a modern form of art therapy where children will be exposed to art in all its
guises, ranging from performance art to other types of artistic manifestations.
 This would be provided by specialists in the field of art therapy as well
as child psychologists. Treatment will be supervised by the project
coordinator, child psychologists, artists and volunteers.</span></p>

<b><span lang=""EN-CA"" style=""font-family: Calibri; color: black;"">Why such a project?</span></b><p class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Calibri; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Over the past decades,
great socio-political instability has led to an unemployment rate of over 70% in
Haiti. Furthermore, the massive earthquake of 2010 left a path of destruction
in which 350,000 people lost their lives, 600,000 were made homeless, and
200,000 children became orphans. To date, many children continue to live in
inhumane conditions and others are either exploited or abandoned.</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Times; font-size: 13px;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Calibri;""><span lang=""EN-CA"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Calibri;""><span lang=""EN-CA"" style=""font-family: Calibri; color: black;"">Throughout Haiti,
survivors, particularly children (school- or preschool-aged), show signs of
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by anxiety, fear,
panic, depression and violent behaviour. An entire generation who has grown up
alongside destruction, death, fear and shortages continues to struggle to make
sense of its experiences and to find a way forward.  Without adequate
support, children risk developing maladaptive behaviours that will affect
their capacity to learn and function effectively in society.  It is
estimated that more than 2 million children in Haiti suffer from psychological scars
left by the earthquake or other catastrophes. </span><span lang=""EN-CA"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;""></span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Calibri;""><span lang=""EN-CA"" style=""font-family: Calibri; color: black;"">In spite of the numerous
organizations working to improve the living conditions of Haitian children
through health and education programs, insufficient attention has been devoted
to their mental health. Consequently, the psychological state of children
remains fragile. Addressing this need is the primary focus of <i style="""">Maison l’art en folie de la Reine soleil</i>.</span><span lang=""EN-CA"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;""></span></p>

for disadvantaged school-aged children (6 to 14) who are survivors of the 2010
earthquake as well as other natural catastrophes and who show signs of trauma.
Services will be offered free of charge to these poor families. Given the lack
of resources, any attempt to charge a fee would make the services inaccessible
to those who need it most. Currently, no other service of this type is being
offered to this segment of the population.</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Times; font-size: 13px;""> </span></p>

</div></div>","Maison l’art en folie de la Reine soleil (la
Reine soleil’s Home of Wild Artistry)
What is the Maison
l’art en folie de la Reine Soleil? 
Background of the
Project
The aim of the Maison l’art en folie de la Reine Soleil
is to provide a safe haven for disadvantaged Haitian children who were
traumatized by the 2010 earthquake as well as other natural catastrophes. Young
survivors’ recovery would be facilitated through various therapeutic opportunities,
particularly through the arts - dance, painting, music, crafts, theatre,
storytelling, traditional games, jump up and more. The main objective of this
initiative is to help children who have experienced trauma to regain a sense of
balance and healing and allow for healthy growth and development. The selected approach is
a modern form of art therapy where children will be exposed to art in all its
guises, ranging from performance art to other types of artistic manifestations.
 This would be provided by specialists in the field of art therapy as well
as child psychologists. Treatment will be supervised by the project
coordinator, child psychologists, artists and volunteers.
 
Why such a project?Over the past decades,
great socio-political instability has led to an unemployment rate of over 70% in
Haiti. Furthermore, the massive earthquake of 2010 left a path of destruction
in which 350,000 people lost their lives, 600,000 were made homeless, and
200,000 children became orphans. To date, many children continue to live in
inhumane conditions and others are either exploited or abandoned. 
 
Throughout Haiti,
survivors, particularly children (school- or preschool-aged), show signs of
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by anxiety, fear,
panic, depression and violent behaviour. An entire generation who has grown up
alongside destruction, death, fear and shortages continues to struggle to make
sense of its experiences and to find a way forward.  Without adequate
support, children risk developing maladaptive behaviours that will affect
their capacity to learn and function effectively in society.  It is
estimated that more than 2 million children in Haiti suffer from psychological scars
left by the earthquake or other catastrophes. 
 
In spite of the numerous
organizations working to improve the living conditions of Haitian children
through health and education programs, insufficient attention has been devoted
to their mental health. Consequently, the psychological state of children
remains fragile. Addressing this need is the primary focus of Maison l’art en folie de la Reine soleil.
Who is the project
intended for?  The project is intended
for disadvantaged school-aged children (6 to 14) who are survivors of the 2010
earthquake as well as other natural catastrophes and who show signs of trauma.
Services will be offered free of charge to these poor families. Given the lack
of resources, any attempt to charge a fee would make the services inaccessible
to those who need it most. Currently, no other service of this type is being
offered to this segment of the population. 
 
Where would the intended
clientele come from?
Students attending
schools in the most disadvantaged areas will be invited to participate in the
program. In addition, partnerships will be established with these schools so
that affected children can be identified and referred by educators and other
professionals in the field. The Maison
l’art en folie will also strive to develop close relationships with other
organizations offering services to children who show signs of mental illness.    What are the project’s
goals? 
 
The Maison l’art en folie de la Reine soleil’s goals
include:


Giving children aged 6
     to 14, with symptoms of trauma, the opportunity to receive therapy from
     specialized workers in the field of child psychology


Provide psycho-education
     on catastrophes and their consequences


Developing, with
     children, therapeutic tools that will help them find themselves again and
     regain their childhood


Empowering children to
     choose the type of art that best suits their healing needs  


Giving affected
     children the means to embrace nature again


Providing a safe space
     where children can verbally express their experiences, fears, anxieties
     and more


Giving
     affected children a safe place to hang out and to be themselves


Teaching children to
     recognize, understand, and manage stress


Teaching children to
     develop a sense of peace, hope and confidence in the future


Helping children to
     learn self-confidence, develop trust, recognize safe relationships and
     environments, acquire a sense of well-being and allow themselves to be
     kids again. 


 
Project Governance
The management and
governance of the Home will be the responsibility of a Board of Directors
(President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Secretary, and Directors) that includes
residents of Haiti and North America
How will the Home work?  In its first year, the
pilot project of the Maison l’art en folie de la Reine Soleil, due to initial budgetary
constraints and to ensure the quality of the care given, will offer services to
about 50 children. A critical goal will be to substantially widen the scope in
the second year. A single point of service is planned for the first year,
however, the aim will be to expand to Port-au-Prince and its surrounding slums
 to reach a greater number of children.
 

Children will
participate in the program on a 6 to 12 months basis. Following the
recommendations and instructions of the psychologist/evaluator, each child will
participate in a custom therapy-through-art program. Throughout therapy,
parents will be closely involved in their child’s healing process.
Once the initial therapy
program is completed, the children will be re-evaluated to determine their
psychological progress. Children who have achieved their mental health goals
will be moved to home care, provided by our psychologist, to allow another
child to take their place in the program. In this way, the Home can help as
many children as possible. 
Who will be working at
the Home?
 
Staff will include
full-time and part-time employees (coordinator, psychologists, artists, and
volunteers). The Home will also welcome young foreign professionals who are
experts in their field and willing to donate their time and knowledge in
helping disadvantaged children regain good mental health. 
How much money does the
Home need to open its doors? 
The project needs
$100,000 to ensure it can function during the first two years.  An initial amount of $65,000 is required to launch
the initiative. We rely on your utmost generosity to bring this project to life.
The $65,000 received will be distributed as follows:
 
·      
Facilities
(two years of rent, paid upfront)
·      
Furniture
(chairs, tables, couch, fridge, stove and more)
·      
Office
materials (desks, computers, telephone, printer and more)
·      
Logistics

·      
Transportation
for children and parents (to and from  the site)
·      
Refreshments
(meals, juices, water and snacks)
·      
Salaries
(8 to 10 staff members)
·      
Travel
expenses for staff 
The Maison l’art en folie de la
Reine Soleil aims to open its doors by the second trimester of
2015 and the Home is counting on your generosity to bring this critically
important pilot project to life. Your involvement would not only change the
future of Haiti’s children, it also has the potential to change the future of
the entire country.
 
As your means allow,
please become a:


Friend – $10 


Fan – $50 


Partner – $100 


Champion – $250 


Benefactor – $500


Angel – $1,000 


Guardian Angel –
     $5,000 


Founding Partner
     – $10.000 


 
** The doors of the Home will always be open to donors
or persons who wish to visit, contribute to the project, volunteer, etc. **
**Every donor name will be painted on the entrance
wall of the home, so that everyone entering the facilities will know who our
wonderful donors are. **
How will the ongoing
existence of the Maison l’art en folie de la Reine Soleil be ensured?
 
For the project to be
launched and to ensure its survival, the Home will be soliciting the support of
government (Ministry of Social Affairs and Ministry of Education) and
non-governmental organizations working with children like UNICEF, Save The
Children/Aide à l’enfance, Food for the Poor, etc. The Home will also seek
financial assistance from religious organizations. Finally, the Home is
planning to hold annual fundraising events and will seek donations in Haiti and
internationally.
Finally, who is la Reine
Soleil?  The soul of the project 
 
La Reine soleil,
Marie-Monique Jean-Gilles, is originally from Haiti. A multi-talented artist,
she uses songs, dance and storytelling to preserve the treasure of Haiti’s oral
tradition in her various roles as facilitator, educator, author, and producer
and director of children’s films.
Marie-Monique holds a
Bachelors degree in Human Relations and Spirituality from Ottawa’s Saint-Paul
University and a certificate in Art and Education from Toronto’s York
University. She has also studied cultural animation at the Université du Québec
à Montréal. 
A survivor of the
January 12th, 2010 earthquake, Marie-Monique was a
horrified witness to the devastation left in its wake. Back in Canada, she
vowed to help Haitian children affected by the earthquake and other natural
catastrophes who, in spite of their trauma and vulnerability, remain the future
light of Haiti. The Maison l’art en folie
de la Reine Soleil is the culmination of her efforts.
Maison l’art en folie de
la Reine Soleil is
but the latest of Marie-Monique’s activities in Haiti, which include: 


Kay Ti Moun arts camp
     (1,500 disadvantaged children participating during the summer)

Thailand, Performance Art Workshop und Asiatopia Festival; organisiert ist die Exkursion von der Universität Hildesheim.Bis vor ein paar Tagen wähnte ich mich finanziell in Sicherheit - dann machten mir eine Heizkostennachzahlung und ein aktualisierter Kostenplan einen Strich durch die Rechnung.Für einen Rückzieher ist es jetzt zu spät, aber um mich nicht total zu verschulden, möchte ich auf diesem Wege versuchen, ein bisschen Geld aufzutreiben. Mit 1000€ wären alle Kosten für die Reise abgedeckt. Aber auch, wenn nicht so viel zusammen kommt, hilft mir das schon sehr weiter!
 KUNST GEGEN GELD
Leider kann ich euch im Gegenzug nicht an den Früchten dieser Reise teilhaben, da Performances eher flüchtiger Natur sind und sich nicht so gut als Dankeschön eignen. Dennoch möchte ich euch nicht leer ausgehen lassen: Ich habe meine Schubladen durchwühlt und Bilder von den Wänden abgehängt, um euch ein paar meiner liebsten Zeichnungen und Aquarelle der letzten paar Jahre anzubieten. Ob als Postkarte, Druck, gerahmt oder ungerahmt oder sogar als Original ist euch überlassen.Es gibt kleine (ca A5), mittlere (ca A4) und große (ca A3) Bilder.Die Kleinen gibt es als Dankeschön in Form einer Postkarte ab 5€, als ungerahmten Druck ab 10€ und mit Rahmen ab 30€.Die Mittelgroßen gibt es als Postkarte für 5€, als ungerahmten Druck für 15€ und gerahmt für 40€.Und die großen als Postkarte ebenfalls für 5€, ohne Rahmen für 20€, gerahmt für 60€.Außerdem gibt es für Beträge zwischen 100€ und 500€ die Originale - allesamt gerahmt.Bitte seht es mir nach, dass ich erst nach dem Thailand-Aufenthalt 
dazu kommen werde, die Bilder Rahmen zu lassen und zu versenden zu 
lassen.Das hier sind die Bilder:

<h3>Hello beautiful people!</h3>
<p>In case we aren't already acquainted, my name is Sarah and I'm a British Artist and Illustrator who lives in sunny Queensland, Australia. During my career, I've illustrated for the likes of Smithsonian Magazine, MAC Cosmetics, L'Oreal Paris, Netflix, Havaianas AU, The British Fashion Council and Stella McCartney. I've been really lucky! I've also exhibited all over the globe from New York and Ottawa to London, Paris and Sydney. Here's some of my artwork:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490511077/dugd8emcrkw8tj4scaux.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I'm asking the help of my friends, followers, fans of my work and The Internet to help me realise my latest project - Garbage Pail Politics. It's an illustrated series that pokes fun at the crazy global political quagmire we are steeped in at this moment in time. And I am hoping to print my Garbage Pail Politicians into a sticker series (possibly with bubblegum!) Fellow kids of the 80s my remember the Cabbage Patch Kids - popular dolls that were parodied by Topps Sticker company's Garbage Pail Kids. These 2 childhood relics helped to inspire my own series which includes Trump, Putin, British PM Theresa May and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490513537/khdggfco5jjpxg4wsaqf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So I'm asking for your help to cover print and design costs to bring the series to life! In return - you'll get the printed product - or if politics ain't your bag - a whole host of other Beetson goodies, delivered to your door wherever you are located on the globe.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>So here's what I need:</h3>
<p>To print 2 packs of Stickers plus packaging, 100 packs = approx £350</p>
<p>To print a small edition of 30 Propaganda Posters (Impeach Trump and Maggie May) = approx £150</p>
<p>If I raise the target of £600, I'll have enough to do all of the above.</p>
<p>If I beat the target, here's what will happen to the additional funds:</p>
<p>If I make £750, I'll use the additional funds to extend the print run and make more packs of stickers.</p>
<p>If I make £1,000 - I'll have enough to pay my awesome graphic designer in more than just art - whoop!</p>
<p>After that, my exhibition fees in Melbourne and London (where I'm showing the series), plus flights run into approximately £2,800.</p>
<p>If by some astronomical anti-political miracle I cover all of the above - I would donate additional funds to the following charites:</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union</p>
<p>The Bar Pro Bono Unit (UK)</p>
<p>Amnesty International</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I can still use the funds raised to make a very small run of stickers and posters - so whatever we raise will see fruition of the Garbage Pail Politicians series.</p>
<h3>I'm becoming a dab hand at this... </h3>
<p>I've previously funded 2 separate crowdfunders, both successful in getting my projects off the ground. In 2012, the I<a href=""https://www.ulule.com/sluts-playingcards/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> funded the printing of 2 decks of playing cards</a>, and in 2014, my <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sarah-beetson-s-coney-island-dream/x/2195815#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dream artist residency in Coney Island</a>.</p>
</div><div><p>I am confident I can make this happen again, with your incredibly appreciated help!</p></div><div>
<h3>You can still help even if you can't donate </h3>
<p>By sharing this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, to your friends and family, and shouting about it everywhere - you are still helping me infinitely - cash or no cash!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and here's to 'Trumping' political BS with ALL of The Colour and The Love and The Art!</p>
<p>P.s Thank you to my nephew Wynton and nieces Etta and Millys for adding a breath of fresh air to this campaign and giving me hope for the future!</p>

<p>We are a bunch of burning man veterans that have participated in many projects over the years.  Theme camps like Xara, The Red Nose District, and Homojitoville; aerialist performances at Center Camp and the Temple of Flux; volunteering at Play Info, Ice Camp and Center Camp Cafe.  This year we want to turn two golf carts into art cars that play off of this year's Cargo Cult theme and our own camp: Gaylactic Invaders.</p>
<p>By day our fleet of planes will be ferrying people around the playa in cargo boxes that can seat up to 4 guests each.  Certainly nothing odd about these planes, even if they do look like they are made from bamboo?  We're not aliens!  At night, EL wire, lasers, and LED lighting reveals the true nature of the beast as we abduct humans and tranform them into interglactic love slaves!</p>

<p>It's a ton of work to modify a vehicle into something fantastic, and when you finish, you have to haul it to the playa and then back.  We have the dream, the time and the will, but we need specialized tools, materials, and (the biggie) transportation.  We need your help to ensure the project gets finished as we labor to turn THIS:</p>

<p>*<strong>Lighting</strong>:  each plane will have EL wire in a circuit-like pattern, LED spotlights, and lasers.  These are both aesthetic, but also for safety at night.</p>
<p>*<strong>Costuming</strong>:  All pilots and flight attendants will be in ET Airline uniforms.  </p>

Access to space to create art is therefore extremely limited and often non existent. There is a serious demand from the student body for an art studio and after six months of building our organization and acquiring members we are ready to ask for your support.</p><p>But we also want to set up a <b>student run community art centre</b> dedicated to supporting art among the local community, allowing us to give back to the city we stay in during our academic studies.</p><p>We have set our <b>minimum goal</b> at £3,200 pounds. If we are able to raise more than this figure the additional money will be used to increase the amount of workshops/ facilities we can provide and ensure Cooper Studios remains a <b>permanent feature of Durham</b> City by helping fund our second year of operation.<br/></p><p><b>Our key aims: </b></p><p></p><ul><li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We aim to end the three year gap students must make from developing their practical skills and portfolios. This is a serious problem which has faced me when applying for jobs and projects in the art job sector as I have not had the facilities to carry on my work whilst studying. This is also an issue all of our members have raised. </span></li></ul><ul><li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Cooper Studios is designed to also be a community art centre and studio. Every Saturday we will be running free workshops for different groups in the local community encouraging them to engage with art and learn new skills. We will also be offering free studio space to members of the local community which revolves around an online rota system. </span></li></ul><ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">These workshops and studio spaces are specifically designed to support young disadvantaged members of the local community who either have an </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">interest or talent in art but lack the materials and facilities</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> to build up a portfolio from which to launch themselves into an </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Art college</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> or profession. We will however be providing workshops and events for other groups such as elderly groups, youth groups and charities. </span>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">To host professional </span>exhibitions, art installments, performance art events, guest talks and life model classes open to everybody.</li></ul><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">How the student membership works:</b><br/></p><p>Members from the student body will be able to access the top floor of the space to work on their art, outside the hours of any community activities that we will be running, for an annual fee. This will therefore generate stable income helping us afford a property from which to launch our community engagement factors. The student members will be sharing the communal studio space with the members of the local community using our free studio space system, whilst also leading or designing the weekly workshops.

Access to space to create art is therefore extremely limited and often non existent. There is a serious demand from the student body for an art studio and after six months of building our organization and acquiring members we are ready to ask for your support.But we also want to set up a student run community art centre dedicated to supporting art among the local community, allowing us to give back to the city we stay in during our academic studies.We have set our minimum goal at £3,200 pounds. If we are able to raise more than this figure the additional money will be used to increase the amount of workshops/ facilities we can provide and ensure Cooper Studios remains a permanent feature of Durham City by helping fund our second year of operation.Our key aims: We aim to end the three year gap students must make from developing their practical skills and portfolios. This is a serious problem which has faced me when applying for jobs and projects in the art job sector as I have not had the facilities to carry on my work whilst studying. This is also an issue all of our members have raised. Cooper Studios is designed to also be a community art centre and studio. Every Saturday we will be running free workshops for different groups in the local community encouraging them to engage with art and learn new skills. We will also be offering free studio space to members of the local community which revolves around an online rota system. 
These workshops and studio spaces are specifically designed to support young disadvantaged members of the local community who either have an interest or talent in art but lack the materials and facilities to build up a portfolio from which to launch themselves into an Art college or profession. We will however be providing workshops and events for other groups such as elderly groups, youth groups and charities. 

To host professional exhibitions, art installments, performance art events, guest talks and life model classes open to everybody.How the student membership works:Members from the student body will be able to access the top floor of the space to work on their art, outside the hours of any community activities that we will be running, for an annual fee. This will therefore generate stable income helping us afford a property from which to launch our community engagement factors. The student members will be sharing the communal studio space with the members of the local community using our free studio space system, whilst also leading or designing the weekly workshops. We currently have (as of 02.03.2014) 23 members and are still growing! But this still does not generate enough, at the present, to cover the whole of the rent and bills.Cooper Studios believes that our members combined with our organization have the ability to really improve the art scene in this beautiful city and provide a suitable platform to aid the artistic community but we can not do this without you. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                   What We Need & What You Get-We need your help! We require £3,000 pounds to help pay the £4,500 rental and annual bills of a property in the heart of the city centre which is very close to the bus station making it accessible as possible to those from the outskirts of the city.

<p><strong>""The Chorus of Kibale"" </strong>is a children’s book (ages 8+) about a young Redtail Monkey named Kibale. Her wild nature gets her separated from her monkey troop in the African rain forest. During a journey through the forest she meets many other primate animals—from Chimpanzees to Bushbabies—that teach her how to listen to find her way home.</p>

<p><br/>The story is set in Kibale National Park, in Uganda, Africa. Its lush rain forest, swamp, and grassland habitats are home to an orchestra of wildlife. The animals are often hidden among the foliage, but exciting part of the Kibale Forest is not so much what is seen, but what is <em>heard! </em>There are a cacophony of sounds that emerge from all levels of the rain forest—from birds, insects and a record density of primates—that can often only be encountered by ear. This book explores those sounds, and the creatures who make them.</p>

<br/>I have had a lifelong passion for illustration, conservation and rain forest wildlife, but I was particularly inspired to create <em>The Chorus of Kibale</em> after first visiting Kibale National Park in Western Uganda in 2009. It was there that I had my first encounter with a troop of Redtail Monkeys during an evening meal. I also camped in a treehouse overlooking a swamp, listened to bird calls, searched for nocturnal primates by flashlight, and trekked for wild Chimpanzees through the dense tropical rain forest—all which helped to inspire the scenes and characters from this book.   <br/><br/>I am excited to finally share this book with fellow primates around the world!<p></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a Seattle-based writer and photographer. My current project examines ornamentation traditions in India, and how these styles of dress are altering because of globalization.</p>
<p>I want to document these traditions traditions and changes by interviewing and photographing women in both cities and villages, and will travel to India for four weeks to do so.</p>
<p>With your donation, I will be able to put together the two media of visual photography and audio interviews to best explain the story of these changes in women’s adornment.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $4500 raised will contribute to:</p>
<p>A roundtrip plane ticket from Seattle to Mumbai </p>
<p>Transportation within the country </p>
<p>Translator fees </p>
<p>Audio equipment rental for the 4 week journey</p>
<p>Food and lodging costs</p>
<p>If goal is not reached, the trip will be shortened to 2 weeks, and take place in fewer regions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are three distinctive moving parts to my project- photographs, audio interviews, and scholarly research. It is my mission to understand the history behind women’s ornamentation in India, how it has altered over the generations to the distinct dress we see today, and how globalization has played a role in these changes.</p>
<p>By documenting this photographically and pairing the imagery with first-hand interviews, I aim to gather a cohesive, cross-disciplinary story of globalization’s affect on Indian women’s adornment with which to share and educate the public.  </p>
<p>Women have strong traditions of adornment practices, and their stories, passed from mother to daughter, are changing in the process. Their stories, some centuries old, need to be told.</p>

<p>I understand that some people cannot contribute monetarily. An awesome way to show your support is by spreading the word on various social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, or with friends and <span>colleagues </span>face to face. Thank you!</p>

I've had this lovely American ""land yacht"" for about 11 years now. I purchased it on eBay in 2003 from a kid who bought it from the original owners. I never intended to drive the car very much because she needed work. However, I didn't even make it 75 miles from the pick-up spot in southern Oklahoma before a transmission-related problem ended the journey to Houston. Nearly a thousand dollars and a week later I was able to limp her home. I puttered about with her over the ensuing years but mostly she was garaged, waiting for her day to shine.</p>
<p>A couple years ago I pulled her out and tried to replace her leaking water pump. I thought I could do it because my dad was a mechanic (he taught me a few things) and I inherited his tools. As reasonable as my aspirations were, I broke a bolt off in the engine block while removing it and suddenly was left with a problem beyond my ability. As life would have it I couldn't afford to fix her, so there she sat for another two years, stuck on a flat tire, baking in the scorching Texas sun and drowning in our torrential rains. To say that her gold-and-white paint suffered during this time would be putting it mildly.</p>
<p>Early November last year I thought I was in a position to finally do her right, so I had her towed to a trusted shop for repairs. I thought I could get her back before Christmas but I was naive: fixing a 50-year old car like this is like opening a can of worms. When the shop finally got around to assessing the car in April this year I was floored with the result. Whatever I had saved (and then spent during a period of unemployment earlier this year) was peanuts. Here's a list of the major work needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>water pump, timing chain, and all the rusty, broken bolts involved</li> <li>carburetor rebuild (or replacement)</li> <li>exhaust system, and all the rusty, broken bolts involved in that</li>
<li>wobbly drive-shaft</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">major tune-up and all the deferred maintenance</span></li>
<li>dead window motors and dry-rotted seals</li>
<li>sagging rear springs</li>
<li>tires and safety inspection</li>
<li>ruined seats and carpets</li>
<li>proper wheels</li> </ul>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Please fix me.</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>It's not her style but if she could talk she'd ask for your help because:</p> <ul>
<li>a classy automotive gal like her likes all the attention she gets</li>
<li>she actually has low miles and a good body</li>
<li>she's got plenty of life left in her motor</li>
<li>she's cool because her air conditioning was fixed early on</li>
<li>she's tired of sitting</li>
<li>they don't make'm like her anymore</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What I need</h3> <p>The $1,500 or so I budgeted for the water pump and broken bolt repair was woefully inadequate. A good shop takes time to do good work, and all of that is expensive. My primary goal is just to get her reliably road-worthy, so I can put off things like the interior work and proper wheels. And as bad as the list is a restoration actually isn't required. (OK, that would be great but I'm realistic.) Nonetheless, all the mechanical work listed above is now pushing past $5,000 and I just don't have that; that's why I need your help. She can be a beautiful cruiser again. I don't want to lose her!</p>
<p>Anything over the goal that the campaign garners will be set aside for maintenance and later work. Thanks for reading until the end.</p>

<p>May 29, 2014 will be the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Empress of Ireland. The passenger liner bound for Liverpool slammed into the Norwegian collier Storstad in a fog in the St. Lawrence river and sank in 14 minutes claiming the lives of 1,012 people. This little known shipwreck was one of the worst maritime disasters of all time.<br/><br/>Carlton Films plans to build a memorial wall in the form of a ship’s hull to commemorate the Empress of Ireland disaster. The wall with its jagged edges and twisted metal surface -  a bit like the steel hull of the Empress of Ireland after the Storstad penetrated its outer skin - will be engraved with the names of the victims and the survivors of the disaster.</p>

<p>Le 29 mai 2014 sera le 100ième anniversaire du naufrage de l’Empress of Ireland. Le paquebot Empress of Ireland est entré en collision avec le charbonnier Storstad dans un brouillard dans le fleuve St-Laurent au large de Rimouski et a coulé en moins de 14 minutes entrainant vers le fond quelque 1,012 personnes. <br/><br/>Les Films Carlton ont comme projet de construire un mur dédié aux victimes du naufrage. Le mur ressemblera à une coque d’un bateau avec une paroi en métal ébréché et tordu par une grande force - un peu comme le coque en acier de l’Empress of Ireland écorché par la force inouie du Storstad. C’est sur ce mur qui seront inscrits les noms des victimes et des survivants.</p>

<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>Carlton Films is a Canadian film distributor who will be helping to finance and promote the Empress Wall while simultaneously releasing the movie Wreck of the Empress in May 2014. This is not the usual kind of disaster movie, but a reflective human and courtroom drama played out on the eve of WWI. The movie tells the story of the captain of a transatlantic passenger liner who ran his ship into a Norwegian collier in a fog killing over a thousand people. It is the story of a woman who survived the disaster losing her husband, a Salvation Army musician, and her boy whose body she has to fight to recover. And finally, it presents the moral dilemma of being true to oneself and at the same time loyal to the company, during a Commission of Enquiry opposing a multinational in the transport industry and a tiny Norwegian coal-hauling firm.<br/><br/>The movie is now in preproduction and will be shooting the enquiry scenes in the old Quebec courthouse on St. Louis Street in Old Quebec. It was there that Lord Mersey and the Canadian judges attempted to determine who was to blame for changing course in the fog in 1914.<br/><br/>Carlton Films was founded in 2004 to distribute films and TV programming in Canada. The company recently purchased Canadian and world rights to the movie Wreck of the Empress which will be delivered in the spring of 2014.<strong><br/></strong><br/>The president of Carlton Films is Nicholas Kinsey, a prolific and multi-talented film director, who has been a successful director of photography, a scriptwriter, a film editor, and a producer over a long career. Kinsey is a Canadian of English origin (dual citizenship), born in Ontario and raised in England. His director credits include several new features: <em>Tree Line</em> (2012), <em>Killing Ruth - the Snuff Dialogues</em> (2011), <em>Leatha Acidents</em> (2011), <em>Short Change</em> (1989), <em>Women Without Wings</em> (2002) and the TV drama series <em>Cottage in America</em> (2012).</p>

<p><strong>THE GOAL</strong><br/><br/>We want to build a memorial to help the families remember their lost parents, aunts and uncles, brothers and sisters. A thousand men, women and children died that night in the fog on the St. Lawrence river. Today the offspring of those people now number over a million people.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Many of the passengers were first generation Canadians and Americans on their way back to the old country for a visit. Their deaths provoked long periods of unhappiness and changed the course of their children’s lives. This is why we want to provide a site where  the families can come together, to remember the event and to communicate with one another.</p>

<p><strong> THE DESIGN</strong><br/><br/>The <em>Empress Wall</em> in the form of a ship’s hull with a visible tear in its skin and engraved with the names of the victims and the survivors of the shipwreck will impress on the mind of the public how the <em>Empress of Ireland</em> ship was rammed by the collier <em>Storstad</em> in 1914 and caused a colossal loss of life. The Norwegian ship tore into the Empress with enormous force, backed up by a load of some 11,000 tons of coal. It’s bow cut through the steel plate of the Empress like butter. <br/><br/>The wall will be approximately 20 feet by 10 feet high and a corner of the structure will show the twisted metal surface and jagged edges caused by the collision. The metal skin will be stretched over the support structure and engraved  with the names of the some 1000 victims, 400 survivors, passengers, crew, sponsors, etc. <br/><br/>The names will be arranged in alphabetical order on the thin metal skin (copperplate or other material) for easy consultation. There will be an interactive video and an electronic message centre for visitors to the site. Family members will be able to leave messages about their loved ones so that others can read their stories. There will also be a short video about the fabrication of the wall.<br/><br/></p>

<p> The <em>Empress Wall</em> will be mobile since it will be installed on an aluminium base on wheels so it can be moved about easily. Furthermore, it will be modular in design allowing easy installation and shipping overseas when required.</p>
<p><strong>THE UNVEILING CEREMONY</strong><br/><br/>On May 29, 2014 the Canadian and Quebec governments will commemorate the <em>Empress of Ireland</em> disaster in the Quebec City port area. At this ceremony Carlton Films will unveil the <em>Empress Wall</em> to a large public gathering of representatives of Quebec City, the City of Liverpool, the City of Glasgow, the Consul General of Norway, several historians of the CPR history, and journalists from the US, Canada and Britain.</p>

<p><br/><strong>A TRAVELLING MEMORIAL</strong><br/><br/>The <em>Empress Wall</em> exhibit will travel to various cities in Canada , Britain and the US during the year of 2014. We expect the <em>Merseyside Maritime Museum</em> in Liverpool will request the exhibit and other museums such as the <em>Massachusetts Maritime Museum</em> in Boston, the <em>Maritime Museum of the Atlantic</em> in Halifax, the <em>Riverside Museum</em> and the <em>Clydebuilt Scottish Maritime Museum</em> in Glasgow, the <em>Waterfront Museum</em> of Toronto, etc. The home of the exhibit will be Quebec City and we will be looking for a permanent installation at perhaps the <em>Musée de la Civilisation</em> or at another place in the city.<br/><br/><strong>THE EMPRESS LEGACY</strong><br/><br/>For some 80 years, Empress passenger liners travelled the oceans of the world, linking Liverpool to Quebec City and New York, Vancouver to Hong Kong, Yokohama, Sydney and Auckland. The Empress ships belonged to the Canadian Pacific Steamship line, a branch of the famous railway empire and were built on the Clyde in Scotland with Liverpool as their home port. Empress ships offered the ultimate experience in trans-Pacific or trans-Atlantic travel and so the Empress name is still today a familiar symbol in Canada, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand where numerous families travelled on CP ships.<br/><br/><strong>HOW WILL WE USE THE FUNDS</strong><br/><br/>We estimate the cost of the memorial including materials, support structure and the electronic message centre at approximately $750,000.  The cost breakdown is as follows:<br/>Conception: $50,000<br/>Design: $150,000<br/>Support structure: $150,000                <br/>Metal skin &amp; engraving: $250,000<br/>Video about the construction: $40,000    <br/>Interactive video: $60,000<br/>Administration: $50,000<br/><br/>We will finance some 70% through government contributions, sponsor funding, and movie promotional funding. We hope to finance the remaining 30% through private donations and crowd funding.<br/><br/><strong>WHAT YOU GET FOR YOUR SUPPORT</strong><br/><br/>You are a vital part of this project and you will be regularly updated as to the progress of work on the memorial. We have developed a range of gifts for our supporters: mini-posters, t-shirts, bumper stickers, digital downloads and DVDs of the movie Wreck of the Empress, free tickets to movie premieres and VIP invitations to the unveiling of the Empress Wall at the opening ceremony on May 29, 2014.<br/>              <br/><strong>CHECKING ON PERKS</strong><br/><br/>After the campaign, we will send you updates as to delivery dates for your perks.

<p><strong>QUI NOUS SOMMES</strong><br/><br/>Les Films Carlton sont un distributeur de films de long métrage qui vont financer et promouvoir le projet Empress Wall et simultanément lancer un film Wreck of the Empress dans les cinémas canadiens au mois de mai 2014. Ce film raconte l'histoire d'un capitaine d'un grand paquebot transatlantique qui a frappé un petit charbonnier norvégien dans un brouillard causant la mort de plus de mille personnes. C'est l'histoire d'une femme qui a survécu au désastre laissant derrière elle un mari, musicien de l'Armée du Salut, et un petit garçon et qui doit par la suite se battre pour récupérer son corps.  Le film présente le dilemme moral entre le faux témoignage et l'infamie des patrons lors d'une commission d'enquête mettant en opposition une grande compagnie multi-nationale dans l'industrie du transport et une petite firme norvégienne transportant du charbon sur la côte est.<br/><br/>Les Films Carlton ont été fondé en 2004 afin de distribuer des films et des émissions de télévision dans l’est du Canada. Le président est Nicholas Kinsey, un réalisateur de films qui a été tour à tour directeur-photo, scénariste, directeur technique et metteur en scène de long-métrages sur une longue carrière dans l’industrie. Kinsey est canadien d’origine britannique (double citoyenneté). Il a réalisé plusieurs longs-métrages incluant <em>Tree Line</em> (2012), <em>Killing Ruth - The Snuff Dialogues</em> (2011), <em>Leatha Acidents</em> (2011), <em>Women Without Wings</em> (2002) et <em>Short Change</em> (1989) et la série dramatique <em>Cottage in America</em> (2012).<br/><br/>Le tournage de l’enquête se fera l’an prochain dans l’ancien palais de justice de Québec sur la rue St-Louis dans le vieux Québec. C’est là que Lord Mersey et les juges canadiens ont tenté de determiner qui était coupable d’avoir tourné son bateau dans le brouillard en 1914.<br/><br/>Pour promouvoir le film, les Films Carlton ont le projet de construire un mur dédié aux victimes du naufrage. Le mur ressemblera à un coque d’un bateau avec une paroi en métal ébréché et tordu par une grande force - un peu comme le coque en acier de l’Empress of Ireland pénétré par la force inouie du Storstad. C’est sur ce mur qui sera écrit les noms des victimes et des survivants.<br/><br/>Le mur sera installé dans un édifice public ou dans un musée pour souligner le 100ième anniversaire avec une vidéo montrant le travail de fabrication et les noms qui apparaissent sur le mur.

May 29, 2014 will be the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Empress of Ireland. The passenger liner bound for Liverpool slammed into the Norwegian collier Storstad in a fog in the St. Lawrence river and sank in 14 minutes claiming the lives of 1,012 people. This little known shipwreck was one of the worst maritime disasters of all time.Carlton Films plans to build a memorial wall in the form of a ship’s hull to commemorate the Empress of Ireland disaster. The wall with its jagged edges and twisted metal surface -  a bit like the steel hull of the Empress of Ireland after the Storstad penetrated its outer skin - will be engraved with the names of the victims and the survivors of the disaster.

It is the story of a woman who survived the disaster losing her husband, a Salvation Army musician, and her boy whose body she has to fight to recover. And finally, it presents the moral dilemma of being true to oneself and at the same time loyal to the company, during a Commission of Enquiry opposing a multinational in the transport industry and a tiny Norwegian coal-hauling firm.The movie is now in preproduction and will be shooting the enquiry scenes in the old Quebec courthouse on St. Louis Street in Old Quebec.

<h2><strong>1975 - Nomadic No More.</strong></h2>
<p><img alt=""Hi, I'm Erich. It's awesome to meet you!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://1975ish.com/images/IGG/erich.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Erich Lehman, owner/curator of 1975. I started out merely as an art appreciator, longing to be as talented as the friends around, and then became a collector, first with art from those very same friends and eventually reaching out to collect work by any artist that inspired me. It was over the course of 10+ years that I built my own collection and eventually wanted to help expose these same talented artists to a community that might otherwise overlook them and facilitate other potential art collectors who perhaps just didn't even know where to begin. I think art can and should be a part of everyone's lives; it enriches life in ways that often are not easy to describe.</p>
<p>Since 2008, I have operated 1975 as a nomadic gallery in Rochester, NY. My original goal for the project was to last one full year, and before I knew it, three and a half years have flown by. During that time, I've worked with over 75 artists, from fledgling local talent to internationally known artists, showcasing many to a community that did not know they exist. </p>
<p>In early 2012, the opportunity to put down roots and establish a formal gallery in the heart of downtown Rochester unexpectedly presented itself to me. </p>
<p>The building is located right in the heart of downtown Rochester, just behind The Little Theatre and Restuarant 2Vine just off the corner of Charlotte St. and Pitkin St., in what Rochester locals would remember most recently as the former Little Bakery Building. You can <a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/18Vw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Location of 1975 Gallery"">see the location on Google Maps here.</a></p>
<p>With this next step, I want to create a proper gateway for Rochester, one that connects with other galleries in the US and abroad to share our local artists and to expand upon what is possible. </p>
<p>1975 has been my labor of love since the beginning, but I need your help to take it the next step further.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p>
<p>1975 has been self-funded since the beginning, building off of $500 and existing off whatever is left over after the artists and expenses are paid. I've used freelance design work to help with costs during this time as well, but to make this huge leap, I need you!</p>
<p>Right now, the expense to renovate the inside of this new space is hovering around <strong>$7500</strong> to get it up to code and set up to host art shows. I am charging ahead to meet this goal, but the expense of renovation is much more than I had anticipated. Like I said, this opportunity came up unexpectedly!</p>
<p>The sole purpose of this fundraiser is to raise funds towards those renovations costs. </p>
<p>I intend to open the doors by mid-July 2012.</p>
<p> <strong>RENOVATIONS INCLUDE (but are definitely not limited to):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ADA approved restroom facility</li>
<li>New flooring <em>(the current one needs a lot of love!)</em>
</li>
<li>New electrical work for the whole building</li>
<li>Gallery lighting</li>
<li>Improved walls to better facilitate art display</li>
<li>A fresh coat of paint for everything.</li>
<li>A host of other minor renovations.</li>
<li>The cost of labor for the professionals!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What You Get:</strong></p>
<p>Much like anything in life, I could never ask this of you without offering something in return (other than awesome, inspring art shows, of course!) Wherever possible, I've worked with local businesses and artists to create unique rewards that speak to what 1975 is all about. </p>
<p><strong>Justyn Iannucci</strong>, who sold his first piece of fine artwork at 1975's <em>By The Pale Moonlight</em> three year anniversary show, is designed a limited edition shirt commemorating this new phase in 1975's life as a reward. <em>(image down below)</em></p>
<p><strong>EvenOdd Creative</strong> will be pairing up with some of my colleagues from the <strong>Sweet Meat Co</strong>. to create limited edition bags in two styles as well as creating more affordable co-branded supporter bracelets, all from upcycled materials.</p>
<p>In addition to the bags, <strong>Lea Rizzo</strong> and <strong>Sarah C. Rutherford,</strong> two artists who were in 1975's very first show <em>Inauguration. </em>in 2008, along with <strong>Saint Monci</strong>, who joined the 1975 family about a year later, have offered up their amazing skills to do custom commission works as higher-tier rewards. </p>
<p><em><strong>Update 6/2/2012:</strong></em> <strong>Mr. Prvrt</strong>, also from the Sweet Meat Co., will also be creating some of these amazing bags!</p>
<p><em>PLEASE NOTE! Due to the limits on the number of perks, we can only offer one artist commission at a time. If you are interested in this reward, please contact me at erich@1975ish.com to specify which artist, and I will tailor the reward individually.</em></p>
<p>I myself will also be creating a series of pieces celebrating my own love of skateboarding and Rochester and offering them as rewards.</p>
<p>You can also donate in smaller increments; anything over $5 will get a handwritten note from me (if you want it) and a small sketch.</p>
<p>I'm also working on a few other perks to fill in the price gaps and will update this as I can! We can only offer 12 thorugh this Indiegogo at a time, so new rewards will be added as others sell out. Please keep in mind each reward level includes the cost to produce and ship the reward! </p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>I've spent the last three and a half years celebrating artists that I believe in, both in the local community and from all parts of the world. Being able to lay down roots in a proper space like this will enable me to celebrate these artists and a host of others I've wanted to bring in to Rochester. I want to help make Rochester an art destination for a niche of artists that are near and dear to my heart, and to share their amazing talents with all of you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Times are tough, and I understand if you yourself cannot contribute to this fundraiser. However, I do ask that you share this campaign through your own networks, be it Facebook, Twitter, etc. to get the word out! Indigogo itself has a whole host of sharing tools right through this page, please use them! </p>

<strong>UPDATE: DAY 1! - </strong><strong>5/31/2012</strong>
</h2>
<p>You guys have blown my mind! <br/>We reached $3010 dollars before 24 hours were up! THANK YOU!!</p>
<p>Due to the huge demand for the Oh Rochester! pieces, I have made 12 more available as a perk for a grand total of 24 (two dozen). Each one will be completely unique and one of a kind. I can't wait to break out the scroll saw again!</p>
<p>Thank you for the amazing support from the bottom of my heart!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>UPDATE: DAY 3! 6/2/2012</strong></h2>
<p>In just three short days, we've gotten within $1300 of our goal of $5000! Your support is amazing! </p>
<p>To make room for some new rewards (our limit is 12 at a time), I'm going to ""hide"" anything that gets sold out. For example, if you bought one of the original 12 ""Oh Rochester!"" pieces, I'm going to hide that sold out reward and show a new one from the artist <strong>Mr. Prvrt</strong> (also from the Sweet Meat Co.). But rest assured, all your information has been collected and you'll receive your perk!</p>
<p>So, friends . . . can you do it? Can you help me reach the $5000 mark by the end of the weekend? We're so close!!</p>
<p>Also: If you are interested in the artist commission, please contact me prior to selecting so that we can specify which artist in the perk!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>UPDATE: DAY 5! 6/5/2012</strong></h2>
<p>It's only been five days, and you amazing, astounding people have helped me reach my $5000 goal! I am blown away by your support!</p>
<p>So what next? There's 32 days left in fundraiser, and still quite a few perks open (with the option to make more!), I'm going to see if we can cover the entire cost of the renovations through this campaign with anything extra going to putting on even better shows than before.</p>
<p>Thank you for believing in 1975 and what I'm trying to accomplish in Rochester. My heart is absolutely swelling with happiness! </p>

</div></div>","1975 - Nomadic No More.

My name is Erich Lehman, owner/curator of 1975. I started out merely as an art appreciator, longing to be as talented as the friends around, and then became a collector, first with art from those very same friends and eventually reaching out to collect work by any artist that inspired me. It was over the course of 10+ years that I built my own collection and eventually wanted to help expose these same talented artists to a community that might otherwise overlook them and facilitate other potential art collectors who perhaps just didn't even know where to begin. I think art can and should be a part of everyone's lives; it enriches life in ways that often are not easy to describe.
Since 2008, I have operated 1975 as a nomadic gallery in Rochester, NY. My original goal for the project was to last one full year, and before I knew it, three and a half years have flown by. During that time, I've worked with over 75 artists, from fledgling local talent to internationally known artists, showcasing many to a community that did not know they exist.

You can see the location on Google Maps here.

I will keep this simple. My name is Gregg Deal. I am a member of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Nation, and the artist behind The Last American Indian On Earth. Recently I got an article in the Huffington Post and have been gaining some ground on the already exsisting documentation of this ongoing performance piece. In the excitement, I have had a number of people inquire about being able to contribute to this project. It is ongoing, which means I am still working on it, and will continue to work on it. By means of photography and video, I am compiling enough information to produce a short film about this project and the social implications of it. Any money going into this is coming out of my own pocket or through donations. This campaign is here for you to donate, support, or share as it continues. 
What I Need
Donation funds go to the following:

equipment
travel (gas, food, tolls, etc.)
materials/props
fees associated with film production
general support


There are a few goals in place, and these donations will most certainly contribute in that. I would like to get to some other cities like NYC, Boston, and even West coast cities. 
The Impact
So much of this project is about Indigenous people and the way people interact with them and perceive them. While my set up is 'hyper-percieved', it still illustrates the point from all sides. As a social project this becomes invaluable in being a clear indication about the tone and attitude towards our nation's Indigenous, thus beginning a dialog concerning race relations between Natives and non-Natives.
What You Get
There are a number of incentives listed below. In addition to the performance work, I am a working artist. I have a number of existing pieces and also take commissions if there is something I do that you like, or would like me to create. I work as an artist full time and can do custom work, just let me know!
Other Ways You Can Help
Donations are obviously helpful, but you are not required to give your money in order to support. I am a full time working artist, and I have existing works available and am always accepting commissions. Additionally, there is always more to do than just giving money, buying my art or commissioning me for something. There are a slew of links below that show the progress, the goals, the interaction and even ways to get involved listed below. Share, like and engage!

<p>Design wise, the temple is a very simplified version of a basic Oriental temple, with the traditional Yin-Yang shape and the octagon of elements that surround it. In the middle of the Temple, a pond in Yin-Yang shape will provide participants the opportunity to dissolve either sweet or bitter memories, thoughts, beliefs, or whatever they want to let go off. They can write these things on soluble paper and ink, that can be placed inside of the pond and will dissolve. To speed up this dissolution, the centre of the Temple is open to sunlight, that can evaporate the water inside. On a daily basis, water will be added to the pond to facilitate a new day of letting-go! </p>
<p>Apart from that, we are currently working on the ability to write on the temple ""walls"" [made of translucent fabric] and having a way to 'dissolve' these walls as well!</p>
<p>  </p>
<h3><em>Current status of the project </em></h3>
<p>As for now, this project is still very much in development. We have a preliminary design and the dedication to bring this structure to Nowhere. One way or another!

<p> </p>
<h3><em>We need your help</em></h3>
<p>Building and transportation costs of the Temple will amount to a total of approximately 2500 euros, including the Indiegogo fees. Nobody on the team will benefit financially from your donations: every single dime will be put to constructing the Temple and getting it to Nowhere! </p>
<p>That's a lot of money, that we can't raise without your help. But we think that for such a potentially powerful and emotional structure, we should do it justice by trying and build it this way. If we don't reach our funding goal, we will try and make a slimmed down version. If by a miracle the total raised amount will exceed this budget, we will add and refine enhanced elements to the Temple! </p>
<p>This money goes to buying of the materials: wooden poles, translucent fabric, and other construction elements. To the construction of the dissolution pond. To lighting the structure to facilitate participants going there at night as well. To dissolvable paper and ink. And to the total cost of transporting all the materials to the Nowhere site. </p>
<p>No money to help us out financially, but love the idea? Apart from this financial help, we need volunteers as well! So if you can't contribute with a donation, maybe you'd like to help out yourself? Either by being part of the construction crew, or maybe even being a Temple guardian on-site? Let us know how you'd like to contribute!</p>

<p><b>About the Artist and Writer team:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Jason Watts is known for his landscapes, which capture a sense of place. He resides in the Chicago area and has had many successful solo gallery shows across the country.   AB Gorham is a book artist and writer, She lives in Tallahassee, FL and teaches Structural Book at Florida State University.</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are in need of  $2500 which will fund the cost of the space in the gallery in the west loop, materials cost for the 12' x 12' construction (wood posts and beams, backdrop 4' x 8' panels and paint) and  the technology for the ambient sound within our space.  If we can reach our goal, we plan on also using some of the funding for original recordings from musician friends that will serve as the soundtrack for this installation.  We are artists and are used to funding our own creations- and would only ask for more if we hadn't gotten a bit over our heads with this current project!</p>
<p>Sound track and videos on creating the piece will be posted on our Facebook page as indication of  progress, and if we exceed our goal we hope to send a memento of the project to our top donors.  All will be invited to our show at AXIS Chicago during Art Expo week and will receive invites and V.I.P. treatment during the show.  We will be giving a presentation at the event that will talk about our collaboration, the artwork and the back stories.  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We believe that some of the best ideas and creative pursuits are done out of creative passion, an inkling that comes to you in the middle of the night and we hope to be a part of that type of concept.  We individually sell our own work, but feel this type of concept is different- and there should be a different type of societal regard for art pieces that are solely about </span>the<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span>concept<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, and to engage the viewer and create a </span>place<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of beauty and intrigue.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span><br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Project: An installation piece for AXIS Chicago in west loop gallery area during Art Expo week Sept 19th- 21st.  We are funding the design and materials and space costs and are in need of additional support.  Our idea is an art concept, with no tangible salable item or goal for profit of any kind.  This is the type of work that will immerse a visitor in a ""place"" and provoke an emotional response.  Our project is a collaboration between artist Jason Watts and writer AB Gorham, and what is currently in the works are painted backdrops and wooden sets that will hold the written pieces, and booklets that tell the story.  It is about mystery, isolation, loneliness, ecology and being at peace with nature, and there is a thread that hints at the people that have passed this place before.
About the Artist and Writer team:

Jason Watts is known for his landscapes, which capture a sense of place. He resides in the Chicago area and has had many successful solo gallery shows across the country.   AB Gorham is a book artist and writer, She lives in Tallahassee, FL and teaches Structural Book at Florida State University.

  What We Need & What You Get We are in need of  $2500 which will fund the cost of the space in the gallery in the west loop, materials cost for the 12' x 12' construction (wood posts and beams, backdrop 4' x 8' panels and paint) and  the technology for the ambient sound within our space.  If we can reach our goal, we plan on also using some of the funding for original recordings from musician friends that will serve as the soundtrack for this installation.  We are artists and are used to funding our own creations- and would only ask for more if we hadn't gotten a bit over our heads with this current project!
Sound track and videos on creating the piece will be posted on our Facebook page as indication of  progress, and if we exceed our goal we hope to send a memento of the project to our top donors.  All will be invited to our show at AXIS Chicago during Art Expo week and will receive invites and V.I.P. treatment during the show.  We will be giving a presentation at the event that will talk about our collaboration, the artwork and the back stories.  
  The Impact We believe that some of the best ideas and creative pursuits are done out of creative passion, an inkling that comes to you in the middle of the night and we hope to be a part of that type of concept.  We individually sell our own work, but feel this type of concept is different- and there should be a different type of societal regard for art pieces that are solely about the concept, and to engage the viewer and create a place of beauty and intrigue.

part in a six-month visiting resident program at Greatmore Studios
followed by a three-month stay in Germany, where he taught art at a
private school in Stendal, ""Private Grundschule Altmark.""</p>

artist, he is inspired by everyday life, hardship, music and history

creations reflect how he looks at things,  be it in detail or more in
general from all possible angles. His work is steeped in
contradiction and deeper meaning. He uses different media, like oil on
canvas and found objects, to create sculptures and paintings. He uses various techniques and
styles: figurative painting, series of old buildings, portraits,
abstract work and ceramic. The ideas on which he bases his work are
always appealing. Despite the dark view of the world we have to face,
there is always a sight of anger, love, happiness and life in his
work.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330804/files/20140126124806-Jabu_2014.jpg?1390769286"" src="""" style=""width: 544.638px; height: 409px;""/></p><b>artist 'Jabu</b><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/339138/files/20140130120056-collage_2.jpg?1391112056"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <b>’Jabu</b>’s art is unique and vibrant with a twist of both urban and

Mabhele Andries Ntuli</b> was born on July 1, 1975 in the mountains of
Enkandla KwaZulu Natal. Ndabuko was groomed for his
artistic journey at an early age surrounded by Zulu dance, singing, playing and
poetry.  Reciting, storytelling and art
was part of daily life in his village and his family. He exhibited his gifts
and his love for the arts from his village as a toddler and never stopped. </p>
<p>Life in the villages during the apartheid era
made it difficult for artists to earn a living from the work they
produced.  Many dreams died and talent
unrealized because of this hardship. The only expectation held within the
village was to  leave home for the big
cities to seek employment and work to support their
families in the villages. Many artists
had to flee South African security forces and live and work in exile, and
Ndabuko’s grandfather was on the list of artists whose work suffered dearly
under the oppressive regime.</p>
<p>Art and inspiration
were gifts stolen from Ndabuko’s late grandfather, Masobeshe Nqamaziyanqubula
Hezekiah Ntuli, who produced gigantic sculptures, a gift he inherited from his
father who was brutally killed by white South Africans for his work because it
was seen as a threat and to discourage the next generation of African artists. A stubborn man,
his grandfather continued to produce great work, most of which left the country with foreign buyers.
Masobeshe eventually went into exile where he continued to produce his
craft.  Upon his return to South
Africa, he was captured and died under suspicious conditions.<br/></p>
<p>Ndubko’s focus on art
followed him all through his education from preschool to high school.  He moved to Alexandra Township where he began
developing his craft at the Alexandra Art Center for less advantaged artists.
Doors started opening up to galleries and exhibitions, but unfortunately, unscrupulous
art dealers exploit artists from the townships and villages and are
perpetuating the struggle for artist like Ndabuko to secure a healthily life
for himself and his family.</p><p>

Today, Ndabuko is a
well established sculptor, painter and singer. Ndabuko Ntuli has a masterpiece
that has been sculpted from the valleys and fields of KwaZulu Natal to become
one of the most creative and inspirational stories of our time<b>. </b>He has
been featured in a number of group exhibitions in South Africa and London.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/339288/files/20140130125117-photo_2.jpg?1391115077"" src="""" style=""width: 581.061px; height: 773px;""/></p><b>Moses Masoko</b><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/339292/files/20140130125157-mm.jpg?1391115117"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>Moses

Factory Studios in Newtown, Johannesburg. This exposure to the art world was an eye-opening experience that inspired her at a young age to become an artist. She later graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Mount Vernon
 College, in Washington, DC, and earned a Master's Degree in Fine Arts from The 
University of Cape Town. She has since participated in numerous 
international residencies and workshops.Xp Art MatshikizaXolelani
Pat Matshikiza  was born in Cape Town, South Africa, where he attended classes at Cape College studying visual art. He was also tutored privately and spent time on a farm drawing and painting
with the well-known South African artist Gavin Collins. In 2006 he took
part in a six-month visiting resident program at Greatmore Studios
followed by a three-month stay in Germany, where he taught art at a
private school in Stendal, ""Private Grundschule Altmark.""
As an
artist, he is inspired by everyday life, hardship, music and history
of old houses, places and people from different cultures. His
creations reflect how he looks at things,  be it in detail or more in
general from all possible angles. His work is steeped in
contradiction and deeper meaning. He uses different media, like oil on
canvas and found objects, to create sculptures and paintings. He uses various techniques and
styles: figurative painting, series of old buildings, portraits,
abstract work and ceramic. The ideas on which he bases his work are
always appealing. Despite the dark view of the world we have to face,
there is always a sight of anger, love, happiness and life in his
work.artist 'Jabu ’Jabu’s art is unique and vibrant with a twist of both urban and 
contemporary touch. He captures diverse appeal from his abstract work to
 artwork inspired by elements and tapestry from South African background
 as this is his origin. However, his work is inspired by 
experiences outside of his origin. He combines timeless materials such 
as maple wood, aluminum, and glass that add to the value of his 
creations. This has created a growing demand for his signature style and
 Afrocentric Contemporary Perspective collection.Ndabuko NtuliNdabuko Julukani
Mabhele Andries Ntuli was born on July 1, 1975 in the mountains of
Enkandla KwaZulu Natal. Ndabuko was groomed for his
artistic journey at an early age surrounded by Zulu dance, singing, playing and
poetry.  Reciting, storytelling and art
was part of daily life in his village and his family. He exhibited his gifts
and his love for the arts from his village as a toddler and never stopped. 
Life in the villages during the apartheid era
made it difficult for artists to earn a living from the work they
produced.  Many dreams died and talent
unrealized because of this hardship. The only expectation held within the
village was to  leave home for the big
cities to seek employment and work to support their
families in the villages. Many artists
had to flee South African security forces and live and work in exile, and
Ndabuko’s grandfather was on the list of artists whose work suffered dearly
under the oppressive regime.
Art and inspiration
were gifts stolen from Ndabuko’s late grandfather, Masobeshe Nqamaziyanqubula
Hezekiah Ntuli, who produced gigantic sculptures, a gift he inherited from his
father who was brutally killed by white South Africans for his work because it
was seen as a threat and to discourage the next generation of African artists. A stubborn man,
his grandfather continued to produce great work, most of which left the country with foreign buyers.
Masobeshe eventually went into exile where he continued to produce his
craft.  Upon his return to South
Africa, he was captured and died under suspicious conditions.
Ndubko’s focus on art
followed him all through his education from preschool to high school.  He moved to Alexandra Township where he began
developing his craft at the Alexandra Art Center for less advantaged artists.
Doors started opening up to galleries and exhibitions, but unfortunately, unscrupulous
art dealers exploit artists from the townships and villages and are
perpetuating the struggle for artist like Ndabuko to secure a healthily life
for himself and his family.

Today, Ndabuko is a
well established sculptor, painter and singer. Ndabuko Ntuli has a masterpiece
that has been sculpted from the valleys and fields of KwaZulu Natal to become
one of the most creative and inspirational stories of our time. He has
been featured in a number of group exhibitions in South Africa and London.Moses MasokoMoses
Masoko began his creative journey as a graphic designer. In 1997, he
ventured into textiles and fabric designs at EzixeleleHlombe and at
the Vosloorus Art Centre. Masoko expanded on his talents as a
print-maker at the Artist Pro Studio. While at the Artist Studio, a
non-governmental organization focused on helping black artists, Masoko also taught art at the Creative Inner City Initiative in
Hillbrow, Johannesburg.
In 2003, Masoko, took his art to
new frontiers by studying at the South African Printing
College. He exhibited at the Art on Paper Gallery in Melville, and at
many other galleries. In addition to being featured in various
galleries in South Africa, Masoko has also been featured in
DirkieOffringa’sbook, ""Walking Tall, Without Fear (24 South African
Artists from the Struggle Era)."" Moses has since expanded his
horizons and his works have traveled abroad, currently in
exhibits in Chicago. Jerry LionJerry
Lion has a unique style, working predominantly in pastel and charcoal, giving us his interpretation of life in the
townships. He focuses mostly on kids as they remind him of his
childhood. In most of his work he depicts the joy and hope of people
of people being happy regardless of their poverty, struggle or their
underprivileged background. Jerry’s work is well sought after
by private collectors, organizations, art galleries, government
organizations.

<p>Thank you for your support in bringing the latest and grandest incarnation of the Mystic Midway to life at <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/mystical-midway-carnival-of-mythic-possibility/edit/www.burningman.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Burning Man</a>!</p>
<p>Inspired by an abundance of community
spirit and social artistry he first witnessed at Burning Man in 1996, project
director Barron Scott Levkoff (aka The Professor) set out on a 20-year mission
to study what made these marvelous social experiences possible.</p>
<p>The ""Mystical Midway,"" to be presented at Burning Man: Carnival of Mirrors, will be the most ambitious manifestation of that mission yet.</p>
<p>The Mystic Midway is a multi-media, interactive social theater
experience that invites participants on a journey of discovery.  It begins when they step into the Midway, an
other-worldly setting of evocative props and engaging attractions.  Inside, the Ensemble will perform rituals, skits, and original songs.  Lavishly costumed characters
from the “7 Families of the Mystic Midway” will engage participants in inquiries
designed to arouse their reflection as they move through their journey.  </p>
<p></p>

<p>Within the Mystic Midway there is no boundary
between creator and consumer.  Burners
from around the world are being invited to cosplay as a persona from one of the
“7 Families” and embody their role on the Mythic Stage alongside us at Burning
Man!  We have published a Cosplay Guide,
a series of tutorials on creating costume pieces, and a deck of Story Cards which
introduce the concepts and characters of the Midway.</p>
<p>The Mystic Midway takes a playful approach to modeling a
new social dynamic.  It proposed a culture of collaboration, empathy,
self-discovery, confrontation of fears,  and liberation from internal barriers to joy...   </p>
<p>By appearing at Burning Man this year, the ""Mystical Midway"" invites the very community that was a major source of its inspiration to join
us in stepping onto the Mythic Stage!</p>

Thank you for your support in bringing the latest and grandest incarnation of the Mystic Midway to life at Burning Man!
Inspired by an abundance of community
spirit and social artistry he first witnessed at Burning Man in 1996, project
director Barron Scott Levkoff (aka The Professor) set out on a 20-year mission
to study what made these marvelous social experiences possible.
The ""Mystical Midway,"" to be presented at Burning Man: Carnival of Mirrors, will be the most ambitious manifestation of that mission yet.
The Mystic Midway is a multi-media, interactive social theater
experience that invites participants on a journey of discovery.  It begins when they step into the Midway, an
other-worldly setting of evocative props and engaging attractions.  Inside, the Ensemble will perform rituals, skits, and original songs.  Lavishly costumed characters
from the “7 Families of the Mystic Midway” will engage participants in inquiries
designed to arouse their reflection as they move through their journey.  


Within the Mystic Midway there is no boundary
between creator and consumer.  Burners
from around the world are being invited to cosplay as a persona from one of the
“7 Families” and embody their role on the Mythic Stage alongside us at Burning
Man!  We have published a Cosplay Guide,
a series of tutorials on creating costume pieces, and a deck of Story Cards which
introduce the concepts and characters of the Midway.
The Mystic Midway takes a playful approach to modeling a
new social dynamic.  It proposed a culture of collaboration, empathy,
self-discovery, confrontation of fears,  and liberation from internal barriers to joy...   
By appearing at Burning Man this year, the ""Mystical Midway"" invites the very community that was a major source of its inspiration to join
us in stepping onto the Mythic Stage!








What We Are Creating...
The Mystic Midway Story Cards
These cards provide the backbone of the entire project. There are four Story Card suits- Characters, Attractions, Concepts, and Main Acts. Each card has a Basic Interpretation, set of Inquiries, and suggested activities designed to bring participants deeper into ‘the heart of their story’.Get a closer look at one of our favorite Story Cards, the Mystic Fire:We will be offering a ‘teaser’ deck of some of these cards as a perk for this campaign and a full deck for our campaign this fall.Pop-up Wagon Carnival



The Pop-up Wagon Carnival will travel Black Rock City, performing the interactive Professor Grimaldi’s Medicine Show for playa citizens as we weave our merry way, joined by Mystic Midway Family members from around the world.
Our wagons will appear in the Bay Area this summer at events prior to Burning Man and will continue to bring their unique flavor of social theater to spaces afterwards. 
Cosplay and Instructable TutorialsWe will create video tutorials and simple style/character guides to inviting burners from all over the world to create their own Midway characters and join their chosen Mystical Midway Family while on the playa.Anyone from anywhere around the world will be able to join in the show and run away with the Mystical Midway. Are you a member of the Harlequin, Mystic, Hobo Kin, Wyrdding Wizzard or Fae Families?Welcome home, Mystical families of the Midway!""Mystical Midway"" Performance Booth in Burning Man’s Carnival of Mirrors MidwayWe will run an immersive 30' x 24' space  at the base of the Man from Sunday till Thursday night, where the Midway Ensemble will unleash Professor Grimaldi’s New World Medicine Show in the evenings. The booth will be open 24 hrs for anyone to explore, spin the Wheel of Mirrors, and step inside the stories on our over-sized Story Cards.Professor Grimaldi's New World Medicine Show In our booth, on the Carnival stages, and amidst the circle of our Midway Wagons, we will host interactive sing-a-longs and theatrical rituals that bring to life the 4 Story Acts of The Mystical Midway Wheel of Mirrors:

ACT 1: The Mythic Stage- Who are you on your Mythic journey into The Midway?


ACT 2: In the Midway- What inner magic will you find in the Midway?


ACT 3: In the Shadow of the Midway- How will you use your magic to meet challenges?


ACT 4: Ars Miraculum (Everyday Miracles) - How will you use your magic to help create magical experiences for others?

Ensemble TrainingThis summer, we will immerse the Mystic Midway community, and anyone who wants to join us,  in ensemble training and costume character workshops taught by Bay Area masters of diverse Commedia, Clowning, Improv and physical theater traditions.

<p>Marie Nimier is one of France’s beloved novelists, songwriters, children’s book writer, and screenwriters. She is known for her surreal and magical writings such as Sirène (Mermaid), and Les Inséparables (The Inseparable Ones), and for her daring plays. ""Another Year, Another Christmas"" was first performed in Paris at Le Théâtre du Rond-Point to sold out performances, but surprisingly none of her plays have been performed in the U.S. until now.</p>
<p>We at Haberdasher Theatre have the amazing opportunity to introduce the American audience to Marie's work.  One of Frances premiere contemporary writers, she is part of group whose use of language has been called:</p>
<p>""...violent, direct and free, their characters torn, disenchanted, and unsettled, their world cold, brutal, and closed off. Their humor spicy, iconoclastic, and dark.  Their style lucid, fragmented and lyrical.""</p>
<p>-Beyond French Feminisms: Debates on Women, Culture and Politics in France 1980-2001</p>
<p>Through this production we seek to bring Marie Nimier's unique voice to the American audience.  A voice that both plays with the musicality of language while at the same time delving into the bonds of family.</p>
<p>""Another Year, Another Christmas"" explores each year, a mother, a son, and his current ""girlfriend(s)"" at the time of meeting for a Christmas dinner that reveals the family’s dysfunction and hidden tragedies of loss and death. Despite the comedic mishaps that take place each year, the mother and son grow closer together and learn to appreciate their short time together on earth. Through Marie Nimier’s inventive use of language and word play, ""Another Year, Another Christmas"" attempts to highlight the ways in which language can communicate deep emotions that are sometimes hidden within the veneer of formality and routine.</p>
<p>This play will be performed simultaneously with a production in Columbus, Ohio, Directed by Hollie Klem. Making this production not only a wonderful story told for the first time in the United States, but also, a Columbus/New York production as well. Both stages will share the same honor of bringing to life the English translation of Marie Nimier’s words in collaboration.</p>
<p>Your support today will go towards our New York production for sets, props, costumes, studio rehearsals, lighting, and paying the amazing artists we have the privilege to work with. </p>
<p>This production also mark Haberdasher Theatre's 10th anniversary creating independent work in New York City, and our second year in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>Community and collaboration have been key staples for Haberdasher since it's inception, and continue to be our main focus in every production.  We view each production as an opportunity for artists to learn and be inspired by each other.  We encourage risk taking, and endeavor to help each artist achieve the fullest realization of their dream. </p>

<p>My name is Paul Lazes and, although I am from Long Island and have spent most of my life in Manhattan – where there are many strong women, I'm struck by how many strong, independent women live on Martha's Vineyard. I've lived here for 17 years. </p>
<p>This project is to honor some of these dynamic Vineyard women, each of whom possesses striking and unique qualities and all of whom share common traits: They are strong and independent, and they exude entrepreneurial spirit. This display of 50 life-size portraits will fill an entire hallway at Martha's Vineyard Hospital, which houses the largest collection of art on the Island. The Tough Chicks portraits will be part of the Hospital's Permanent Art Collection.</p>
<p>The Collection will be seen by thousands of people – staff, visitors, and patients, who hopefully might be cheered up and perhaps even inspired by these images of bright, strong women.</p>
<p>The hospital does not pay for its art.  Artists donate their work and finance their own production and installation.  My costs will be $6,000.</p>
<p>If we don't reach my goal of $6,000, I will continue my efforts to raise the money required to execute the work. If I exceed my goal, I will put the funds toward publication of a book of the images.</p>

<p>​About filmmaker David Yuzuk</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the last 18 years, I’ve worked as a police officer and detective in Miami. I have always attempted to get to know many of the homeless and down on their luck individuals I encounter in my daily shift.</p>
<p>I immediately took a liking to Richard and for over a decade we were friends making small talk about world politics and movies. I never pressed Richard on his past due respecting his right to privacy. </p>
<p>It's my intention to finish the journey we started together in detailing Richard’s complex life. Interviews of his family, friends, and military comrades along with photo’s, video's, and re-enactments will help to paint that picture. My plan is not to twist his life’s story into some Hollywood hero propaganda film but to tell his life story as accurately as I can.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Co-Producer/Co-DirectorJEREMY MCDERMOTT </p>
<p>Jeremy McDermott is a South Florida filmmaker that takes a cinematic approach to any project he's involved in. His body of work entails commercial/corporate accounts to feature and short films. His approach to the documentary is to investigate all the open questions left in Richard's wake then let the chips lie where they fall. </p>

<p>Since then, Neil and his son David have co-authored five books in the Beachside PD series and Neil has written seven screenplays. Since moving to Los Angeles, Neil has been working with Ken Rotcop, an award-winning writer who, before he retired, was the former head of four major film studios.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>By contributing to the project you help keep Richard's memory alive and honor his service to his country. It also further educates the public of the plight of many of our war veterans who not only suffer from PTSD but ultimately become homeless.</p>

<p>Dans le cadre d'une rétrospective majeure sur Pierre Ayot (1943-1995) orchestrée par le commissaire et critique d’art Nicolas Mavrikakis réunissant plusieurs lieux de diffusion dont la BAnQ, la Fondation Guido Molinari, la Galerie Graff, la Galerie Joyce Yahouda, le Musée d'art de Joliette et le Musée des Beaux-Arts de Montréal, la Galerie B-312 présente deux projets autour de la croix : sa recréation* et <i>Res Ipsa Loquitur,</i> une exposition autour de l’événement <i>Corridart</i>. </p>
<p>Rappelons que le maire de Montréal, Jean Drapeau, fit détruire, quelques heures avant l'ouverture des Jeux olympiques de 1976, les œuvres de <i>Corridart</i>, une exposition d’art public qui s'étalait sur plusieurs kilomètres de la rue Sherbrooke. Pourtant cette exposition avait été commandée par le Comité d'organisation des Jeux olympiques....</p>
<p>L'œuvre <i>La croix du mont Royal</i> était une réplique à échelle réduite (44 pieds de long par 20 pieds de haut et 4 pieds de large) de la structure de la croix qui surplombe le mont Royal. Cette œuvre, initialement présentée sur le terrain de l’Université McGill, sera cette fois-ci installée au pied du mont Royal, au coin de l'avenue du Parc et de l'avenue des Pins. Comme le voulait Ayot, la croix semblera être venue se reposer quelques moments au bas de la montagne…</p>
<p>Nous avons aussi choisi cet endroit car il permettra certainement de réfléchir à l'avenir des bâtiments de l'Hôtel-Dieu alors que l'hôpital qu'il hébergeait est en processus de délocalisation. Quel destin sera réservé à cet héritage, à ce patrimoine religieux et architectural?</p>
<p>Cette recréation de l’œuvre de Pierre Ayot (en collaboration avec Denis Forcier) sera exposée pour une durée de deux mois, de la fin septembre à la fin novembre 2016. L’exposition s’y rattachant sera présentée à la Galerie B-312 du 15 octobre au 12 novembre 2016.</p>
<p>Nous avons déjà reçu l’appui du Bureau d’art public de la Ville de Montréal, de l'Arrondissement Plateau-Mont-Royal, du Conseil des Arts de Montréal et de la Caisse populaire du Plateau-Mont-Royal (10 000 $, 10 000 $, 5 000 $ et près de 3000 $ respectivement). Il nous reste un peu moins de 13 000 $** à trouver. </p>
<p>Nous avons besoin de vous !</p>
<p>Joignez-vous à nous pour ce projet fabuleux : Voir la croix dont tout le monde a entendu parler mais que personne n’a vue !<br/>Rendez hommage à un artiste majeur de l’histoire de l’art au Québec.<br/>Participez concrètement à la réalisation d’une œuvre d’envergure.</p>
<p>N’oubliez pas : toute donation de plus de 25 $ sera accompagnée d’un reçu pour déduction fiscale. Celui-ci vous sera envoyé à la fin du mois d'octobre.</p>

</p><p><b>Summary: Who I Am</b></p>
<p>Claire Lorenzo is visual artist living and working in
Brooklyn, NY.  She has been
creating hand-cut collage art for nearly a decade.  Her material draws on old, yellowing pages from paperback
books, vintage maps, Life magazines, black and white photographs, found
postcards, and forgotten letters.</p>
<p>In late 2015, Claire launched In Pieces, a collage-design
inspired line of screen-printed clothing (denim jackets, sweatshirts, tees) and
recycled homeware (flower vases, jewelry boxes, ornaments) featuring her
original analog collages.  She
successfully sold a portion of these items in the Williamsburg Artist &amp;
Fleas art market, the ADC Holiday Bazaar, and through her Etsy Shop, In Pieces
Art.</p>
<p>Her work, <i>July 1981, </i>was
awarded Runner-Up in Greenpoint Gallery’s November 2015 Salon Exhibition.</p>
<p><b>What I Want to Do Now</b></p>
<p>Her latest collage endeavor will take Claire outside of the
city and to upstate New York, to the The Art Students League of New York’s May
2016 Artist Residency Program. During the short but sweet 28-day program,
Claire will return to the traditional fine art medium, creating a large scale
(49 sq. ft.) collage, which will attempt to explore the theme of rampant
misogyny in popular American magazines. 
</p>
<p>Drawing on vintage Life and National Geographic magazines
from the 1950s-1980s, Claire’s art isolates various traditional highly-misogynist
American advertisements, and them reinvents them—turning them on their heads,
and eliciting new meanings.  By
removing these advertisements from their original pages, and then transforming
them into something different, Claire hopes to call attention to how deeply
engrained misogyny was, and still is, in our visual American consumer culture.</p>
<p><b>Why This Residency</b></p>
<p>The Art Students League of New York’s residency program
will provide me the opportunity to explore my art in a fresh context.  I’ll be able to gather feedback from
likeminded artists and advisers in a new and supportive environment.  Simply put, I have not been able to
create any large-scale work like the 6 foot pieces I created for my thesis at
Fordham University in 2013.  My
apartment is simply too small, and it isn’t financially possible to afford
another art studio in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
<p>Someone once explained a residency like going camping: “you
venture out of your usual environment to experience the wild and unknown,
knowing you will come back home.</p>
<p><b>Impact: Where Your Donations Will Go</b></p>
<p>By contributing
to this campaign, your donations will enable me to participate in the May 2016
Vytacil Art Students League Residency. 
If met, the $3000 goal will cover my costs to enroll in the program:
residency deposit, housing, art materials, as well as transportation to the location.  </p>
<p>With your
contribution, I will be able to work day and night for 28 days in order to
create this work.  Your dollars
will literally go towards lighting my studio, and paying for the canvas and
supplies needed to fulfill project.</p>
<p>The Vytacil
Residency program is highly selective, only accepting less than 10% of applicants.  I was selected as one of six candidates
out of over a hundred applicants for the May 2016 residency.  If I am unable to meet the program
costs, my spot will be immediately forfeited to someone else and I will not be
able to attend the program.</p>
<p><b>What You Get in Return</b></p>
<p>Contributions of
$100 or more will entitle you to an original, limited-edition, signed art print
by the artist, featuring an original Claire Lorenzo collage.</p>
<p>A donation of any amount will entitle you to an invitation
to the end of program exhibition at the Art Students League of New York’s Vytacil
estate in Sparkill, NY on the evening of May 27th 2016. </p>
<p>Thank you for your time and generous donations.  I could not do any of this without your
support!</p>

<p>Hello, we are <i style=""color:red;""><strong>Applepond</strong></i> - a group of 3 tenacious BA(Hons) Contemporary Media Practice students on a quest to raise enough funds to make our final major project a reality!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, let us give you the rundown: our project is a ‘knockoff’ ( or simulacrum if you’re fancy) of the American infomercial. Now you might be thinking - ‘Hey, aren’t infomercials those really corny adverts that try sell people magic mops and stuff?’ Well, we can reassure you that you are exactly right! However our art piece is far more than just an advert you might see between the hours of 2 am - 5 am on your TV. No no no, we thought why not take the bad taste of infomercials to the next level and create a physical space for everyone to be a part of.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Basically, we have decided to create our own make-believe country to reflect the delightful cheesiness of infomercials and the consumeristic values they represent within western culture today. Sound exciting? We sure hope so!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, in order to create our own make-believe country and make it the best make-believe country we know it can be, we need a little bit of cash for the necessities. Things such as: wooden boards, wallpaper, printing ink, swimming pool, and a remote-controlled cruise ship. You know, everything you’d expect would be needed in order to create your own make-believe country!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our degree show will be on the 4th - 8th of June at the Ambika P3 gallery space in Baker Street.</p>
<p>All are invited to experience our installation for themselves, as well as enjoy the other art pieces that will be at the show!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any contributions would be much appreciated and really help us take our project off the ground. Thank you for taking the time to have a cheeky look at our funding page, and we hope to see you at the show!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Much love, Applepond</p>

<h3>You've had a dream... so why supporting an emerging artist?</h3>
<p>Since I'm a little kid, I've loved drawing, painting and doing all sorts of art but as I grew up, adults confronted me with their view of reality: go study civil engineering because anyway you'll never make a living being an artist. And that's when all my dreams of being an artist faded away. I launched myself in a <a href=""www.about.me/noamkos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">career of training and coaching</a>, gave <a href=""www.bit.ly/tedxwarwick"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2 TED talks</a> and I started <a href=""www.seeducation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a non profit to help others fulfill their dreams</a>. </p>
<p>In 2011, I was given a 10 years old camera to have fun with and posted a few photos on Facebook. Fast forward two years and I've got over <a href=""www.myworldinsight.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">700 High Dynamic Range photos</a> on Facebook, I've organized an exhibition in London, I've been selected for the <a href=""www.accessibleartfair.com/brussels/artist/noam-kostucki/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brussels Art Fair </a>and I've published two photo books. </p>
<p>Since I've had the camera it's been a little temperamental but it is only during my last photo shoot in the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10100362675074972.1073741836.193100681&amp;type=1&amp;l=9278f8880d"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bronx, New York</a>, I realized my camera didn't save almost 50% of the photos taken and I had to stop taking photos because it was giving me too many error messages. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the adults were right up about the beginning of this journey: none of these exciting things has brought enough money to buy a new camera. </p>
<p>I love taking photos because it is a way to show the world under a different lens. People often tell me that I make places look more beautiful than the way they saw it before. I like to believe that with my photography, I can make people smile and have a better day. You can help me continue taking photos by supporting me here. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>Every little helps: even if you can contribute only $1, please do it because the value of this $1 to my motivation will be 100 folds! Knowing that you support me and believe in my art is the most important. </p>
<p>I'm not being very fancy: all I need is a new camera to continue sharing my photos on Facebook and build a career as a photographer. What can be more rewarding than sponsoring an emerging artist before he's been successful? It is now that I'm struggling with finances that I need your help :)</p>

I’m Obui, a 23 year old Creative Director with a few other
titles that come with unpaid work that's worth a lot and does a lot but doesn't
seem to pay the bills.
The journal came from an obsessive-compulsive tendency
to collect critique and create publications,  Oi! was created to serves as a consciousness raising bedrock
for creatives like myself who are talented intelligent, intellectual, culturally
enlightened, with a good sense of humour. A place to collaborate, share ideas, creatively
critique and enhance society as a whole whilst simultaneously establishing a
space for promotion where others can find artists, writers and inventive
specialists to collaborate with, hire, commission, endorse, or fund.The
journal’s first issue was launched in February from my bedroom (using my
smashed Macbook screen to navigate the internet) after 3 months with the help
of some fantastically passionate contributors who put their best forward at no
cost.Initially published online, I realised there was a
bigger demand to obtain the journal in print than I had imagined; after 17 days it received 1452 hits with an
average of 4 minutes spent reading and numerous emails asking how and where
it can be purchased.As I began planning the Autumn Winter Issue I
realised I’d need a budget to help future contributors exercise their skills
accordingly.
Reality Check, tangible resources…
And after
a month of extensive additional research into printing, (as mentioned before,
yuh, bit OCD with publications) I realised the best way to physically bring
this publication to life, each journal hand to be individually handcrafted,
like an Art sketchbook.Not just
that, it would need a small team of knowledgeable, resourceful Marketers, PR,
Online Content producers and Event Managers to bring the Journal to complete
fruition, spreading awareness, and also organizing the distribution and launch
event in September. Things I tried to do alone and realised was almost
practically impossible and needed to be done right, in order to be done well.
So, what are the costs you say?

5 months Creative
     Consultancy – PR/ Marketing/ Event Management - £1000
I
mentioned before, I’m just a Curator/ Creative Director, I can put ideas
together and bring out the best in people, that’s my strength, but with the
help of professional business team Oi! can get the help it needs to actualize
its potential.

Contributors
     Travel and Creative Equipment expenses - £250
Although we do not have a budget for this
journal, we can help our creative contributors help us by paying for travel
expenses, studio time and any equipment needed to create decent content.


Printing and Packaging Expenses
     £900
Feedback and analysis show that although we
are a very tech savvy generation we still desire the tangible and the physical
pleasures, so to keep a fair balance we have decided to print and handcraft 500 copies;
125 of each edition for schools, Universities,
charities, and youth clubs.  
Free education is vital
to the success and enlightenment of our peers, younger and old. And we want to
be able to reach them no matter where they are like a light in a dark tunnel. 
The Impact
Because of the privatisation of creativity and creative institutions,
someone somewhere owns our right to express ourselves as Creatives. Someone
somewhere dictates our future as Creatives, teaching us to conform to a more
logical and subservient working life that benefits them and leaves us broken,
confused and robotic. With cuts to funding for the arts, a prodigious rise in
tuition fees, and a lack of jobs for graduates, undergraduates and Creatives
alike. What are we expected to do?
Well we can start by sharing ideas, collaborating and keeping a fluid
evolving journal on our experiences in, and thoughts on, society and hopefully

MC Sunflower Jones is a kitschy-chic production consisting of the of us, two lovebird zinesters, Deirdree Prudence &amp; Steven Hughes Purkey, making zines non-stop ‘cause zines are our lives &amp; we adore it. We make zines for us &amp; we make zines for you. With you. For us &amp; for you.</p>
<p>We started this campaign because we’re the epitome of starving artists – what we lack in funds we make up for in an inspiring creativity that overflows with motivation &amp; non-stop love. We want to make the greatest zine ever &amp; have it in the hands of as many people as possible – a grand adventure but we need your help! Join us on this ride &amp; we will show you a crazy artistic blast like no other!</p>
<p>This zine, What’s Your Damage? – Mental Illness &amp; Shit!, will be the talk of the town. There have been other mental health zines out there, there will be more, but this, dear reader, will be “it”. A pop-culture bonanza of psychotropic drugs, interviews from shrinks, profiles on the insane, reviews of other mental health zines, hilarious tales of depression, personality disorders, you name it, if it pops it’s in. The cherry on the top, however, will be the companion microzines detailing each of the most popular disorders from Schizoaffective to Borderline Personality. A glorious comp zine filled with international contributors straight outta the psych ward accompanied by microzines that will only make you smile. A demented smile. A smile shared from us to you.</p>
<p>We love zines. We love you. We want to share our love with you. But, dear reader, it’s expensive. It takes money &amp; we need your help! Take a peek into the backstage creative monster of a madhouse, of the zinester creator:</p>
<p>MC Sunflower Jones is the name of our copy machine. Every true zinester needs one to call their own. Fuck Kinko’s. But we need toner. Lots of toner. Toner to print this batty gem of a project!</p>
<p>We need paper. Lots &amp; lots of paper. White paper galore. &amp; for the cover? Here’s a sneaky peek: a dream would come true with you help – cardstock the color of psych ward walls. This zine deserves only the best, the contributors deserve only the best, the readers deserve only the best &amp; a heavy cardstock cover is where it’s at.</p>
<p>Staples. Metallic blue staples. Only the best for this zine.</p>
<p>Buttons. We need buttons &amp; they’re cheap to make but remember, dear reader, the starving part of ‘starving artist’. Buttons would be awesome. We want the stark raving mad smiles of What’s Your Damage? to be carried around on your lapel even after the brilliantly cracked pages are put down.</p>
<p>Stickers. See above &amp; replace buttons with stickers.</p>
<p>Once the zine is done, hot off the press, distribution is insanity. It takes cold hard cash but those smiles, smiles from contributors &amp; readers &amp; you, those smiles are needed in this world. Postage &amp; postal supplies. We want them everywhere. We want the post office gang to hate us. Or love us. We want to know them by name.</p>
<p>With every donation there comes a present from us to you. Every single donor will get a smile in return. We have gifts! They will be in the form of some of these things: a copy of the zine &amp; microzines, a button, a hand-painted postcard from Deirdree, MC Sunflower Jones zines aplenty, handwritten love letters, stickers, &amp; your name in print within the zine!</p>
<p>We want the world to enjoy the madness that is What’s Your Damage? – Mental Illness &amp; Shit! Because people need to feel the love &amp; comfort of flashy solidarity in what can be a lonely existence when coping with psychological issues. We want people to laugh at depression. Smile at the silliness of their anxiety. We want you to enjoy the lunacy that is you you you.</p>
<p>We want the zine at every zine library. Every retailer that carries zines. Across the world. The contributors deserve it - &amp; you deserve the thrill that comes with their words &amp; art.</p>
<p>MC Sunflower Jones has been called prolific &amp; inspiring &amp; all that jazz. We really live the life of the hardcore zinester. We have sold our zines at large zine fests. We have sold our zines at smaller events. Shops that don’t even carry zines display MC Sunflower Jones’ shit with pride. We can do this. It’s a magical adventure &amp; we want you to tag along. With your help we can make this happen.</p>
<p>We def understand that not everyone can donate cold hard cash (or numbers on a computer screen). If you can’t, don’t fret ‘cause your anxiety is our anxiety in this rode paved with Prozac. We still need your support! Contribute some art! Tell us a tale of your love affair with your therapist! Rip out your journal pages from Cognitive Behavior Therapy daze &amp; send them to us!</p>
<p>We also need your support by sharing this campaign with your friends…if you know of anyone who might need the light-hearted security blanket of this zine, send them our way &amp; we’ll make new friends. Sharing is caring, said the Care Bears in the ‘8Os. Sharing is caring &amp; we care a lot.</p>

<h3>VISION: Our Project is Your Project</h3>
<p>Vivant Art Collection is the art gallery of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the ultimate social enteprise. From its inception—Vivant has bought art from developing countries and bringing it to U.S. markets, as effort for economic develpoment and awareness in these underrepresented countires. Vivant has never been dictated by what is selling in the art world but focused on presenting cultural diverse art.

roots dating back to 1917 as the Art Club of S. Petersburg, the Morean Arts
Center focuses on our mission to connect people with art through innovative, community-oriented
art and art education and to contribute to the economic development of the
region.  Our classes and outreach programs are designed to bring out the
artist in all of us. We offer adult programs, kids programs, family programs,
early childhood programs, and summer camp programs, attracting beginners and
advanced students alike.</p><p>
We offer more than 350 different classes in 15 different mediums.<span>  We have over 1,700 individuals who have attended
our educational programs, and more than 900 campers participate in our summer art
camp program.  We have provided over $25,000
in educational assistance through scholarships to qualified individuals.</span><br/><br/>Campers will enjoy a week
of art-filled experiences using selected weekly themes, including stories,
songs, and games in the self-contained Bank of America Children’s Learning
Center. Children will explore various art mediums, such as watercolor, oil
pastels, tempera paints, collage, and sculpture in both guided and self-guided
experiences.

</p><p>Campers will travel
through a wide range of media, rotating between two different classrooms and
two different teaching artists. Children will learn art processes, explore
basic art concepts and skills, and learn the proper care for art tools and
materials. Our summer camp art teachers use selected weekly themes to create
hands-on art experiences that focus on the learning process as well as the
final works of art. While final works of art will head home on Fridays, each
group will complete a collaborative piece of art that will be displayed in our
summer camp exhibition in the Risser Gallery.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/346166/files/20140203070551-Isaac.jpg?1391439951"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Sessions include a diverse array of transformational art experiences. <i>Coming up in summer 2014:</i><br/><b><br/>Charmed

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Tim Duax and Frank Gess would like to continue to produce a photography book which shows the negative impact of thoughtlessly placed utility lines and poles.  Two examples - In Ohio recent efforts brought before the Ohio Supreme Court sought to relocate proposed power lines away from unspoiled farm fields in an established Amish farming community.  In Wisconsin a third of a billion dollars is currently proposed to create three new high tension lines running through forest and glacial landscape.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Funding will simply continue to support our photography efforts to produce a montage of natural and architectural beauty diminished by poorly placed utility lines and poles.  Gas money, sub sandwiches, coffee, cheese curds, etc... did I mention gas money?  We donate our time and equipment.</p>
<p>Please see our video as example: <a href=""http://youtu.be/Z5CsKaXiDzo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/Z5CsKaXiDzo</a></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every little bit helps.  We are not ""against"" electrical power, rather we see greater utilization of green power and local production of power as increasingly feasible options.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Across this country are local groups that recognize how utility lines impact the quality of life of those near them.  Obviously, it is a matter of self-education and connecting with local groups.</p>

</h3><p>Hello, my name is Anthony L. Fowler Jr., and I love comics.<br/><br/></p><p>I am an aspiring comic book inker based in the St. Louis, MO area. An inker has a job unique to American comics; an inker lays down the black lines over penciled comic art, adding depth and weight to the page, as well as making coloring easier. I have been drawing since I was about 13, and I have come to respect the artistry and challenge that comic book inking supplies. It is my desire to become a professional comic book inker, and I'm driven to make that happen. I currently work on several small inking projects, do character commissions, share inked samples over other artists' pencils via Facebook and DeviantArt, and I have also published stories with St. Louis-based comics collective Ink &amp; Drink Comics. Here's a sample page I inked over Robert Atkins:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263333/files/20131216054304-Venom__20_Page_11.jpg?1387201384"" src="""" style=""""/></p>More examples of my work can be found at my <a href=""http://afowlerart.deviantart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DeviantArt page</a> and my <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/afowlerart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a>.<p></p><p>I have found that to get work in this industry, it is necessary to visit comic conventions and show your portfolio to editors and artists who may want to work with you.

I’m Kirarts, a poliedric italian artist about multimedial communications. Some time ago, I was looking for an idea for a new product that approaches the work of illustrators to the world of web. When I stay in front of the big monitor of my iMac, surfing the Internet, I often see large unused white spaces on either side of a website. In fact, every time I create a website I always wonder : ""How do I fill the white background on either side of my template?"" So I created a blog and I enjoyed to drawing a background and a mascot, that you can see below:In that moment I had the idea to create a web shop to sale illustrated backgrounds for websites: Website-Background.com.Website-Background.com
offers backgrounds grouped by theme, illustrated with traditional or digital
mediums, and with original ideas to make a memorable website!
About 40
Italian artists help me to build Website-Background.comand every
week I get requests for collaborations from new artists. I hope they
will always increase and that this project will guarantee them a satisfactory
self-employment. This is also my desire and it's the reason why I’m trying to
start this business!
What We Need & What You Get
The StartUp
project, the first and only, needs your help to grow up!A budget of
3000€ would give the first necessary boost for advertising through Google and
Facebook. Advertising
for 10€ per day distribuited between Google and Facebook → about 300 € per
month.
A minimum
budget of € 3,000* would cover about 9 months.
Even if the
budget is not reached, the money would be spent on advertising anyway.*Including Indiegogo's fees the amount would be € 2,790.
We have illustrators with different skills, so we can
offer attractive services to compensate your appreciated contribution ! Take a
look at the Perks!
Stretch Goals (In case of exceeding Goal)

€ 6,000Of this
budget would be invested €3,000 for other 10 months of advertising on Google
and Facebook, the main Goal would be to recruit more professional artists in
order to expand and improve the services offered. Website Background wants to
aim at the quality of the illustrations! There would be funds to purchase more
server space in order to expand with many new illustrations and pages such as
Wallpapers , Mascot, Banner and Artists Area.

Stretch Goal is reached, the contributors have access to the following Perk :

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Last fall, we had an amazing day of celebration centered around the Occupy Movement. The event took place at Pritchard Park and was inspirational to those already involved while encouraging others to become more involved.  We had amplified sound and many musicians and speakers had a chance to have their voices heard.  We had an extremely smooth General Assembly which introduced those unfamiliar with GAs to an often times difficult, yet truly democratic, process.  We had food; we had soap box; we had information booths.  We had celebration! It was a chance for all of us to feel inspired and reenergize for the long road ahead.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to another similar event on Saturday, April 14-- ""tax day"" falls on the 17th this year.  We aim to make this next event even bigger and broader.  We are encouraging all artists, musicians, and theatrical persons to come out and share the beauty that comprises Occupy Asheville. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<div>The costs for having amplified sound is $200 for 6 hours.  We are asking for $500 because that is the minimum we can ask for on this site.  Any extra money will be deposited directly into the the Occupy Asheville account.  Thank you for your donations!</div>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The Viscera Organization is a non profit organization that aims to assist female filmmakers and artists get their work exposed and celebrated and is trying to shed a little light on the challenges women face in the industry. I will be directing two commercials for the organization to help get the word out about the film festival and the organization as a whole and I hope you'll help me too. </p>
<p>I will be directing the ads and will be working with some great talent including the Viscera ladies themselves, Heidi Martinuzzi, Shannon Lark and Stacy Pippi Hammon to take the amazing artwork of <a href=""http://wilderwein77.deviantart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Irene Langholm</a> and bring it to life.  The video ads will make it quicker and easier for people to spread using social network marketing and the like.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While the word about Viscera is spreading fast and the organization has already helped so many talented women, it's time to really get the word out there to the masses through one of the most popular mediums today, video.  The creation of the ads will expand the knowledge and awareness of the organization and it's filmmakers and contributors (artists, indie artists, etc.).  Every person involved with Viscera deserves the exposure and that is my goal. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While the majority of those involved with the project are donating their time, there are certain things we do need hard cash for such as equipment, special fx, the green screen and more.  Because of that I'm looking for a very nominal amount to make sure that this is done right.  We only have a few days left since we've all put in what we can so I'm asking for your help now.  </p>
<p>Each person that donates at least $20 will receive a tangible thank you card signed by everyone that participated in the shoot/production.  Those who donate $100 or more will receive a personalized thank you video from us ladies working on it. $1000 or more gets you a DVD with the finalized videos and your personalized thank you video in addition to all of the above. </p>

<h3><strong>Hello Friends and Family and people I probably don't know yet! </strong></h3>
<p>This is Kira here. I'm a 28 year old artist from New York City who'll be moving by myself to New Orleans in exactly two weeks. I'm coming to you today on the interwebs to tell you why I'm moving there, what's happened to me lately, and how you could maybe help. </p>
<p>In May of 2011 I took an epic road trip with my dear friend Liz, and we spent 2 days in New Orleans. I've never been anywhere like it. There is music in the streets everywhere you go. The air smells like the most delicious of food. The people are so unbelieveably welcoming and enthusiastic about where they live, it's shocking compared to what I feel in New York City. Most importantly (for me anyways) is the art. There is art EVERYWHERE. Jackson Square is a park in the middle of the French Quarter where people go just to sit and paint and create things all day and put what they've done on display so passers-by can look and hopefully purchse. Not to mention the fact the the city is litterally filled with local artist based galleries and co-ops, not to be found in nyc. Being an artist is a legitamite JOB there. People go to New Orleans to BUY art. And listen to amazing music. And eat incredible food... I wanted to be a part of it.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I fell in love with that place. As soon as I returned with the notion that it was really time to leave new york, I met a man, fell in love, and ended up staying in nyc. Without getting too much into that, for now let's just mention that he and I went to New Orleans for my 2nd trip this past May only a few months ago. Everything was as I remembered it only better. I felt so overwhelemingly inspired there. All of the houses are painted different colors, and that means a lot to someone who's soul uses colors to express herself. There are huge twisty trees up and down the avenues that look like they've been there for 300 years. Needless to say, I had another amazing time - and actually upon driving away from the city I wept for a good hour. My time in new york, a city of grays and browns - was over. All I wanted was to be in the city with colors. </p>
<p>Shortly after returning home from our trip, the man I love kind of unravelled mentally and lost his job. I did the silly thing you do when you're in love and started supporting us both financially. Things kept getting worse and worse and then on fourth of july he snapped and somehow decided to kick me out of our house. For nothing. Which screwed me out of my $600 security deposit . Meanwhile he had wiped out my savings, and currently still owes me minimially $500. Which of course he's refusing to pay. </p>
<p>This brings me to where I stand now. I have been working my butt off trying to save as much money as I can, but I really could you any and all help from all of the wonderful people in my life. And as you can read over on the ""perks"" part of this site, I'm not just looking for handouts. Not only will anyone who donates ALWAYS have a place to stay in new orleans (of course) if they want to come visit me ;) ... but  I will be all too grateful to show my gratitude artistically in any way I can. Paintings, sketches, doodles, tell me to draw something and I WILL. </p>
<p>In conclusion, I hope you are all well and happy in your lives. I hope you continue to follow your heart and fufill your dreams. Please, if you can - help me follow and fufill mine. I want to be a successful artist, and I believe I can do that in New Orleans. I just gotta get there. </p>

</h2>
<h3>
</h3>
</div>
<p>WALL\THERAPY is an art and community intervention project,
using public murals as a means to transform the urban landscape, inspire, and
build community.<span><br/></span></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p>
<h2>
<b>What has WALL\THERAPY</b> <b>done so
far?</b>
</h2>
<p>2500 cans of
spray paint and 300 gallons of paint later, over 60 of the most talented and
recognized artists from the region, the nation, and the world have shared their
talents to create over 100 murals throughout the city of Rochester since this
“Visual Intervention” project began in 2011.</p>
<p>These murals have transformed walls, buildings, and neighborhoods. This transformation has sparked inspiration in individuals and communities alike.<br/> The murals have become part of the local
conversation, the local identity, and the fabric of the city. Local art classes and
schools tour the murals as part of the curriculum. Local professionals change
their route to the murals part of their drive home. Local artists, young and
old, find inspiration in the works.</p>
<p>WALL\THERAPY mural
project is now recognized worldwide. People
from 2000+ cities in 104+ countries have visited the WALL\THERAPY site to learn
more. New mural artists from around the world ask about painting
Rochester, for the first time or for another time.</p>
<p>The project has
gained steady media attention, and media coverage has included 100+ articles,
blogs, and videos about the project from a variety of media outlets including
NPR and Huffington Post.</p>
<p>Earlier in 2015,
WALL\THERAPY was selected to partner
with the Google Cultural Institute Street Art Project to insure that all murals
would be accessible through capturing the imagery of the work and through
interactive access via Google Maps.<span><br/></span> </p><p></p><div><br/></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431574812/s8ewj03yufs1poxitajc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><a href=""https://walltherapyny.culturalspot.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://walltherapyny.culturalspot.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click to visit out Cultural Institute site, where we have all of our murals archived in high resolution: https://walltherapyny.culturalspot.org</a><div><b style=""font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;""><br/></b></div><div>

<b style=""font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;"">Why does WALL\THERAPY</b><span style=""font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;""> </span><b style=""font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;"">need your
help?</b>
<p>Making all of this
happen year after year takes a lot. With a core team of 13 members, our 50+ expanded team that makes this project happen are all volunteer, but the materials, equipment, and
artists to make it all happen require financial support. You donations go towards the paint for many
large-scale walls, renting construction lifts to safely access and paint those same
large-scale walls, and the travel expenses, hospitality and a very
modest honorarium for the 15 professional artists that will share their talent
with the project this Summer. </p>
<p>WALL\THERAPY was created
thanks entirely to financial and volunteer donations from its many supporters. We
are asking again for assistance to continuing this forward momentum, to
continue to bring unique artists to our city to help inspire and to heal. </p>
<p>Your continued support will allow us to
support the local and international artists as they produce visually compelling
murals in the Rochester cityscape, in turn improving and strengthening our
thriving community. </p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></b></p>
<h3><b>___________________________________________________</b></h3>
<div>
<h2><b><span><br/></span>What your donation means directly to the cause: </b></h2>
<p><b>For every $15</b> you donate, we can provide an artist with about 3 cans of spray paint. </p>
<p><b>For every $25</b> you donate the money goes for 4-5 cans of spray paint or a gallon bucket of primer </p>
<p><b>For every $50</b> that means we can purchase paint brushes, rollers, buckets and cover other supply expenses. </p>
<p><b>Donations of $150 or more</b> helps the team supply the artist with food and water as they paint their murals.</p>
<p><b>Donations of $500 or more</b> helps us rent a mechanical lift for the week, and our artists don’t have to stand precariously on a ladder to paint their work.</p>
<p><b>Should you donate $1000,</b> that money goes directly to plane tickets and any sort of car rental needed for the artists</p>
<p><b>If you donate $5000, </b>you are not just solidifying WALL\THERAPY this year and becoming a producer of this event, but you will be instrumental in helping us start focusing on the humanitarian endeavor and sister initiative known as IMPACT! </p>

<h2>THE PERKS</h2>

We've got a few more on the way (we can only load 20 at a time), but don't delay, as we only have as few as one of some of these perks!<span><br/></span></p>

What is WALL\THERAPY?




WALL\THERAPY is an art and community intervention project,
using public murals as a means to transform the urban landscape, inspire, and
build community.

What has WALL\THERAPY done so
far?

2500 cans of
spray paint and 300 gallons of paint later, over 60 of the most talented and
recognized artists from the region, the nation, and the world have shared their
talents to create over 100 murals throughout the city of Rochester since this
“Visual Intervention” project began in 2011.
These murals have transformed walls, buildings, and neighborhoods. This transformation has sparked inspiration in individuals and communities alike. The murals have become part of the local
conversation, the local identity, and the fabric of the city. Local art classes and
schools tour the murals as part of the curriculum. Local professionals change
their route to the murals part of their drive home. Local artists, young and
old, find inspiration in the works.
WALL\THERAPY mural
project is now recognized worldwide. People
from 2000+ cities in 104+ countries have visited the WALL\THERAPY site to learn
more. New mural artists from around the world ask about painting
Rochester, for the first time or for another time.
The project has
gained steady media attention, and media coverage has included 100+ articles,
blogs, and videos about the project from a variety of media outlets including
NPR and Huffington Post.
Earlier in 2015,
WALL\THERAPY was selected to partner
with the Google Cultural Institute Street Art Project to insure that all murals
would be accessible through capturing the imagery of the work and through
interactive access via Google Maps. Click to visit out Cultural Institute site, where we have all of our murals archived in high resolution: https://walltherapyny.culturalspot.org
What is happening this year?
WALL\THERAPY and URBAN NATION are excited to launch the International exchange program between Rochester and Berlin this year. Artists curated by the UN Director Yasha Young have been invited to participate and contribute to the program of WALL\THERAPY 2015 curated by Ian Wilson (founder, co-curator) and Erich Lehman (co-curator, lead organizer). WALL\THERAPY 2015 will kick off on July 17, 2015. Our theme for this year is surrealism and the fantastic.

UN Exchange artists 2015 include:Andreas EnglundOnur and Wes21NEVERCREWVextaLi HillHandiedan (joining us in Late June)SellFable City  (Participating in the IMPACT! show)
WT artists 2015 include:DazeJeff SotoMaxx242Nate HodgeEder MunizBrittany WilliamsMatthew Roberts and Joe Guy Allard
Brooklyn Street Art founders Jaime Rojo and Steve Harrington will be contributing with a very exciting special talk on Friday of WALL\THERAPY week.
To start things off right this year, we will be holding our first proper art exhibition kickoff titled IMPACT! This exhibition will take place at 1975 Gallery (89 Charlotte St.) and will showcase artwork from all the 2015 participating WALL\THERAPY artists in support of IMPACT! – IMProving Access to Care by Teleradiology – www.impactrad.org. IMPACT seeks to provide easier access to better care in underdeveloped and underserved regions through cloud-based x-ray services and a network of volunteer radiologists supporting IMPACT sites. Both WALL\THERAPY and IMPACT! are projects of The Synthesis Collaborative.


Why does WALL\THERAPY need your
help?
Making all of this
happen year after year takes a lot. With a core team of 13 members, our 50+ expanded team that makes this project happen are all volunteer, but the materials, equipment, and
artists to make it all happen require financial support. You donations go towards the paint for many
large-scale walls, renting construction lifts to safely access and paint those same
large-scale walls, and the travel expenses, hospitality and a very
modest honorarium for the 15 professional artists that will share their talent
with the project this Summer. 
WALL\THERAPY was created
thanks entirely to financial and volunteer donations from its many supporters. We
are asking again for assistance to continuing this forward momentum, to
continue to bring unique artists to our city to help inspire and to heal. 
Your continued support will allow us to
support the local and international artists as they produce visually compelling
murals in the Rochester cityscape, in turn improving and strengthening our
thriving community. 

___________________________________________________

What your donation means directly to the cause: 
For every $15 you donate, we can provide an artist with about 3 cans of spray paint. 
For every $25 you donate the money goes for 4-5 cans of spray paint or a gallon bucket of primer 
For every $50 that means we can purchase paint brushes, rollers, buckets and cover other supply expenses. 
Donations of $150 or more helps the team supply the artist with food and water as they paint their murals.
Donations of $500 or more helps us rent a mechanical lift for the week, and our artists don’t have to stand precariously on a ladder to paint their work.
Should you donate $1000, that money goes directly to plane tickets and any sort of car rental needed for the artists
If you donate $5000, you are not just solidifying WALL\THERAPY this year and becoming a producer of this event, but you will be instrumental in helping us start focusing on the humanitarian endeavor and sister initiative known as IMPACT!

Over the last few years I have had the opportunity to work for some amazing clients such as Paizo Publishing, ActionPhase Games, and Kobold Press, along with other freelance opportunities. You may have seen me at such conventions as Indiana Comic Con, Indy Pop Con, Gen Con, Youmacon, and Acen, to name a few. </p>
<p>Atelier: A Book of Characters is about more that just sharing a few pretty pictures. It is about sharing the knowledge I have gained as an artist and what inspires me with the public.

<p>This campaign is to help me print a limited number of the art book. I can't do this on my own as it is costly to run a larger volume of self printed books. So I am reaching out to my fans, art community supporters, and lovers of all things creative and educational.</p>
<p>Pledging to this campaign will help me print off enough books in time for this years Gen Con convention, and best of all you can get your own copy (and one of the first in order) by pledging.</p>
<p><b><i>Why is it so special to pledge now and not buy later?</i></b> This campaign directly affects the number of books I can print. Each book will be numbered out of the volume count which means if 50 people pledge for a book and you are one of those pledgers, your book will be numbered within that 50 count. Each book will also be signed by me.</p>

<p>I've seen so much of this trash, that I'm challenging myself to furnish an entire (tiny) home with these items.

<p>Obviously - This project is going to take a bit of money to pull off - I would LOVE to replace the entire fence (it is busted and broken). It would cost $300 in supplies and labor.

<p>Donate $25 you will receive Polaroids of the fence Before/After! - Donate $50 and you get two Polaroids and a Thank You letter signed by all the artists on the team!

<p>Please help us to better our community. If you cannot donate, consider spreading the word! Let's continue to inspire each other by breathing new life and energy to this city</p>

</div></div>","Hi Everyone,
Thank you so much for taking time to get to know my project better.

THE PROJECT
The interactive installation, “Everybody has a sound”,  transforms the sound of  human movement into light.   Participants will be encouraged to move freely throughout the space with each individual creating their own unique projections which will be layered into projections from others in the space at the same time.  Every movement  will produce frequencies which will  in turn be transformed into light.
Heavy movement produces low tones and light movements produce high tones.
 
Everybody has a sound - Conceptual Diagram:

Without participants the installation is only a shell.
This interactive installation is based on the idea that everybody is just human beings; we are all the same yet we have our own unique sound.
I am creating a space where people can communicate without words, a space that isn’t  disturbed by the noise of the discourses of society. The space is made as an opportunity for the viewer to become a participant in the piece and be a part of a social experiment of communication without words.  
I am creating this space as a counter environment to society, a space with no limits or restrictions. The space is made of mirror, so when the tones are transformed into colors they will be reflected in the rest of the room and fold out like a kaleidoscope. 
The project becomes like walking inside of the body; the participants’ inner perspectives are projected out in colors creating an environment that would become a symphony of interaction.
 
THE BUDGET
The first part of the project, happening in August 2012, is the development of the unique software and testing the visual expression of the project.  For this we need $8,900:camera, computer, projector, hard disc, chapels, test space, speakers and sound system.
For the second part of the project, - building the actual mirrored shell - we need$6,870: covering the 150 sq. meters in mirror, building the wooden shell to hold the mirror, 8 feet x 8 feet video screen.
 
“Everybody has a sound” is an opportunity to see alternatives in interaction and communication and I am eager for participants to share this experience.

Our first 2 books touched briefly on the character design process, but this new book is a <strong>really deep dive</strong> into the art. Character design is such a vast field, which is why it needs it's own focused, indepth book. </p><p>We're working with an <strong>amazing line up</strong> of incredible industry <strong>PROFESSIONALS</strong>, and the book is jam-packed full of their combined experience, gained over their long careers. </p><div data-caption=""Design Example - Unofficial  Cover"" data-id=""25076704""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Design Example - Unofficial  Cover"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1560787735/ilg2ssk5iy9eivhkp4ar.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption>Design Example - Unofficial Cover</figcaption></figure></div><div data-caption='Design Example - ""Character Archetypes"" Chapter' data-id=""24413434""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt='Design Example - ""Character Archetypes"" Chapter' class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1560787736/nuhfjapbhwco4nkqbx7t.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption>Design Example - ""Character Archetypes"" Chapter</figcaption></figure></div><h1> <strong>The Goal!</strong> </h1><p>Our goal is to help <strong>YOU be a better artist</strong> and have fun at the same time! We want to provide you,  both <strong>hobbyists and pros</strong>, with a better understanding of the <strong>WHOLE</strong> character design process. Most importantly, the book gives you the <strong>tools you need</strong> to produce unique and memorable characters. </p><p>The techniques and tutorials included in the book help <strong>build your confidence</strong> and <strong>strengthen your knowledge</strong> of the art of character design, enabling you to successfully design for any project, and most importantly, in any style. And that's why we have such a wide array of artists with varying styles contributing to book! </p><p>This is a book that we have dreamed of making for a long time and it is our biggest project to date. We're making a book that <strong>you'll love</strong> and cherish for your whole drawing career. <strong>YOU will love every page</strong> or else you'll get your money back!

Our first 2 books touched briefly on the character design process, but this new book is a really deep dive into the art. Character design is such a vast field, which is why it needs it's own focused, indepth book. We're working with an amazing line up of incredible industry PROFESSIONALS, and the book is jam-packed full of their combined experience, gained over their long careers. Design Example - Unofficial CoverDesign Example - ""Character Archetypes"" Chapter The Goal! Our goal is to help YOU be a better artist and have fun at the same time! We want to provide you,  both hobbyists and pros, with a better understanding of the WHOLE character design process. Most importantly, the book gives you the tools you need to produce unique and memorable characters. The techniques and tutorials included in the book help build your confidence and strengthen your knowledge of the art of character design, enabling you to successfully design for any project, and most importantly, in any style. And that's why we have such a wide array of artists with varying styles contributing to book! This is a book that we have dreamed of making for a long time and it is our biggest project to date. We're making a book that you'll love and cherish for your whole drawing career. YOU will love every page or else you'll get your money back!

Something that creates a visual centerpiece for meditation, or a soothing background ambiance for a work space or relaxation at home I say '3 or more' because this project is 3, but if it goes well and I have additional materials left over, I will make additional pieces while I am on a roll! If the project goes well, I’d like to try and incorporate light into  future versions of this project too! <br/><br/><br/><strong>Why are you interested in concrete, Mr Metalsmith? </strong><br/>I have always been interested in sculpture, even while pushing into the jewelry and craft field. Usually anything with moving, changing bits and bobs that are influenced by nature, be it wind or water, will catch my eye. I am also very interested in the way light interacts with water and other materials. Well, it's been enough looking, time to get into it myself! <br/><br/>On top of that, I find the concept of center-piece meditation, during which a practitioner has an object to focus on, to be very appealing. I think that water features have a very primal connectivity to human thought and that they can function very effectively in this regard. Even the light babbling of a small waterfall in your living room can have an amazing effect!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Gimmie Specifics... </strong><br/>For this project, I’d like to explore the amazingly versatile cast-in-place concrete methods I keep seeing and hearing about. They show up in home remodels, kitchen counters, and gardens. I want to do so within an area of sculptural interest for myself, so I chose fountains because I love the ambiance that moving, trickling, splashing water can create. I spend as much time as I can in the wilderness by rivers and streams and the ocean and the power of water is astounding. I want to bring this experience, even if in a small way, into the home. </p>
<p>I am going to make <strong>three  </strong>'in home' sized fountains. Which amounts to about 1ft (30cm) by 2 ft (61cm) by 1.5ft (45cm). This is the general size, as some of the designs are shorter, or taller, skinnier, or longer. All in all, they'll encompass the same physical presence when functioning.</p>
<p>In-home fountains are nothing new, hell, the Greeks had them. But I think everything can be re-defined in a new aesthetic quality and I hope you enjoy my take on a timeless concept. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Why Concrete? </strong><br/>I find concrete to be a fascinating material. We've all, mostly, sat in the mud as a kid and packed it together, made sand castles, or pushed dirt around. But it is very temporary and never seems to last. Concrete, or more specifically mortar mix in this case, functions nearly the same way but after the water leaves, it is solid and stable! I love the idea of low cost materials (coming from Jewelry experience!) that can be so mold-able  I look forward to another dialog with a new material.</p>

<p><br/><br/><strong>Those look weird, what is the process? </strong><br/>Basically, the process is pretty simple. I will create mold forms out of Styrofoam sheet, duct tape, hot glue, and whatever else necessary to create the shape of the sculpture fountains. This will also include any cast-in-place structural bits I might need such as bars to maintain negative space, wood or metal feet to the bottom, and any aesthetic items that will be permanently fixed into the cement. <br/><br/>From there I will mix the mortar mix with the possible addition of nylon fibers for strength and pour it into the molds. Since I have to use more water to get a pour-able consistency, the molds will have to stay in place for at least 2-3 days before I can remove them. If we were in a less-humid climate, I could get away with less, but as I found with my color samples, they can be a tad crumbly if you aren't patient!<br/>  <br/>Once the cement is fully cured and dried I will be able to do finishing to the surface texture using sand paper and buffing wheels, add dyes, and seal the inside surfaces with polyurethane to minimize wear on the cement by the moving water.</p>
<p>Finishing touches such as stone filler (black rocks are sooo cool!) and installing the pumps will complete the process! <br/><br/>For more detail photos of the prototype, check out my supplemental page here! <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>How will the project evolve afterwards? </strong><br/>While this isn't a direct part of the project, it is exciting none the less. Once the project is finished, I will be left with at least 3 fountains that are aesthetically cohesive! I am excited to get into sculpture and gallery art, and I think I might be able to use these fountains for gallery application and submission processes in Portland Oregon! So by helping me with this project, you are giving me more things to play with as I establish my artistic world!</p>

<p><br/><strong>How can I help you, Mr. Penniless Sitar Player? </strong><br/>Art isn’t free, unfortunately, or I’d spend countless days in my studio working on new designs. I have been running a small metal-art business for a few years now and the economy is not ideal. I have wanted to break into this new medium, but have lacked the expendable income to do so. By supporting my project, I will finally have the start-up experience needed to express at least a few of the dozens and dozens of sketches I have done over the years. And the resulting finished project will fuel my exploration of a new medium that can go towards MORE projects! </p>
<p>By backing my project, you are making this dream a reality and giving me a head start, and that is priceless!<br/><br/><strong>What makes you think you're good enough? </strong><br/>Basically I am a serial craftsman. Be it art, structure, food, functional, or decorative, I can’t get enough of making things with my hands! I am a bit of a jack-of-all trades. <br/><br/>I have my roots in a wide range of skills ranging anywhere from: <br/>jewelry fabrication and design <br/>knifemaking, <br/>wilderness survival, <br/>camping and homesteading, <br/>Sewing, <br/>cooking, <br/>martial arts, <br/>wood working, <br/>bone carving, <br/>and a bunch of other odds and ends. <br/><br/>Turns out I love to learn and I retain information well when I can get my hands in on the work. <br/><br/>More specifically for this project, I have done a fair bit of cement and concrete work in construction settings, helping with odd jobs. I have even worked with limecrete in Wales on an eco-house! Plus, I have a prototype fountain that is 3 feet tall, albeit a bit ugly. I have done some basic work in acid-washing cement, and I am excited to refine all of this into the next level of concrete work.</p>

<p><br/>For more details, check the FAQ or submit your own questions! <br/><br/>Thank you for Kickstarting my project!</p></div>","What is it? Basically, I will design and create at least 3 cast-in-mold concrete fountains that will incorporate water movement and sound in the design. Something that creates a visual centerpiece for meditation, or a soothing background ambiance for a work space or relaxation at home I say '3 or more' because this project is 3, but if it goes well and I have additional materials left over, I will make additional pieces while I am on a roll! If the project goes well, I’d like to try and incorporate light into  future versions of this project too! Why are you interested in concrete, Mr Metalsmith? I have always been interested in sculpture, even while pushing into the jewelry and craft field. Usually anything with moving, changing bits and bobs that are influenced by nature, be it wind or water, will catch my eye. I am also very interested in the way light interacts with water and other materials. Well, it's been enough looking, time to get into it myself! On top of that, I find the concept of center-piece meditation, during which a practitioner has an object to focus on, to be very appealing. I think that water features have a very primal connectivity to human thought and that they can function very effectively in this regard. Even the light babbling of a small waterfall in your living room can have an amazing effect!Gimmie Specifics... For this project, I’d like to explore the amazingly versatile cast-in-place concrete methods I keep seeing and hearing about. They show up in home remodels, kitchen counters, and gardens. I want to do so within an area of sculptural interest for myself, so I chose fountains because I love the ambiance that moving, trickling, splashing water can create. I spend as much time as I can in the wilderness by rivers and streams and the ocean and the power of water is astounding. I want to bring this experience, even if in a small way, into the home. 
I am going to make three  'in home' sized fountains. Which amounts to about 1ft (30cm) by 2 ft (61cm) by 1.5ft (45cm). This is the general size, as some of the designs are shorter, or taller, skinnier, or longer. All in all, they'll encompass the same physical presence when functioning.
In-home fountains are nothing new, hell, the Greeks had them. But I think everything can be re-defined in a new aesthetic quality and I hope you enjoy my take on a timeless concept. Why Concrete? I find concrete to be a fascinating material. We've all, mostly, sat in the mud as a kid and packed it together, made sand castles, or pushed dirt around. But it is very temporary and never seems to last. Concrete, or more specifically mortar mix in this case, functions nearly the same way but after the water leaves, it is solid and stable! I love the idea of low cost materials (coming from Jewelry experience!) that can be so mold-able  I look forward to another dialog with a new material.

Those look weird, what is the process? Basically, the process is pretty simple. I will create mold forms out of Styrofoam sheet, duct tape, hot glue, and whatever else necessary to create the shape of the sculpture fountains. This will also include any cast-in-place structural bits I might need such as bars to maintain negative space, wood or metal feet to the bottom, and any aesthetic items that will be permanently fixed into the cement. From there I will mix the mortar mix with the possible addition of nylon fibers for strength and pour it into the molds. Since I have to use more water to get a pour-able consistency, the molds will have to stay in place for at least 2-3 days before I can remove them. If we were in a less-humid climate, I could get away with less, but as I found with my color samples, they can be a tad crumbly if you aren't patient!  Once the cement is fully cured and dried I will be able to do finishing to the surface texture using sand paper and buffing wheels, add dyes, and seal the inside surfaces with polyurethane to minimize wear on the cement by the moving water.
Finishing touches such as stone filler (black rocks are sooo cool!) and installing the pumps will complete the process! For more detail photos of the prototype, check out my supplemental page here! How will the project evolve afterwards? While this isn't a direct part of the project, it is exciting none the less. Once the project is finished, I will be left with at least 3 fountains that are aesthetically cohesive! I am excited to get into sculpture and gallery art, and I think I might be able to use these fountains for gallery application and submission processes in Portland Oregon! So by helping me with this project, you are giving me more things to play with as I establish my artistic world!

How can I help you, Mr. Penniless Sitar Player? Art isn’t free, unfortunately, or I’d spend countless days in my studio working on new designs. I have been running a small metal-art business for a few years now and the economy is not ideal. I have wanted to break into this new medium, but have lacked the expendable income to do so. By supporting my project, I will finally have the start-up experience needed to express at least a few of the dozens and dozens of sketches I have done over the years. And the resulting finished project will fuel my exploration of a new medium that can go towards MORE projects! 
By backing my project, you are making this dream a reality and giving me a head start, and that is priceless!What makes you think you're good enough? Basically I am a serial craftsman. Be it art, structure, food, functional, or decorative, I can’t get enough of making things with my hands! I am a bit of a jack-of-all trades. I have my roots in a wide range of skills ranging anywhere from: jewelry fabrication and design knifemaking, wilderness survival, camping and homesteading, Sewing, cooking, martial arts, wood working, bone carving, and a bunch of other odds and ends. Turns out I love to learn and I retain information well when I can get my hands in on the work. More specifically for this project, I have done a fair bit of cement and concrete work in construction settings, helping with odd jobs. I have even worked with limecrete in Wales on an eco-house! Plus, I have a prototype fountain that is 3 feet tall, albeit a bit ugly. I have done some basic work in acid-washing cement, and I am excited to refine all of this into the next level of concrete work.

Special Thanks to... I went over to West Side Concrete's Hillsboro branch to talk with Brandon Russell about logistics and dyes. He was a huge help. I will also be getting most of my materials at West Side Concrete once the project succeeds. Thanks guys! Head into the store or check them out athttp://www.westconacc.com/ Thanks to my buddy Mike Chastain for filming and editing my video, his camera is much nicer than mine and he's a smart cookie ;) Photos! In addition to the photos below, you can see more in progress and reward item photos by clicking here! Backer Rewards! Bamboo Earrings,

<h3>Who Is Gold &amp; Apel?</h3>
<p>I'm Elsa Briggs, an artist and jewelry maker.<br/><br/>My art reflects themes of mystery, seduction, love &amp; lust. I prefer portraits but also enjoy botanical studies. My jewelry is inspired by the Victorian era and the Art Nouveau &amp; Art Deco movements.<br/><br/>I am relaunching my company, Gold &amp; Apel, and want to take it to the national stage at the Bayou City Art Festival (BCAF) in March 2013. This is one of the top ten art festivals in the United States and you must apply at least 6 months in advance to exhibit there.<br/><br/>Exhibiting at the BCAF has been one of my big artistic dreams, but the costs associated with setting up my booth (part of the application process is a photo of your booth with all your art set up in it) and also producing enough art and jewelry to fill a 10'x10' booth for a high-volume sales show like BCAF have been prohibitive.<br/><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking for $6000 for the following expenses:<br/>* my booth and displays ($1500);<br/>* my application &amp; entry fees to Bayou City ($500);<br/>* limited edition giclee prints of my artwork ($750);<br/>* promotional materials ($500);<br/>* classes and workshops for jewelry-makers ($750);<br/>* bulk wholesale orders of art &amp; jewelry supplies ($1600); and<br/>* packaging supplies for my online &amp; market sales ($400).</p>
<p><br/>Any additional amount that I raise will go towards upgrading my booth, more prints, more supplies &amp; more entries into local &amp; regional markets.<br/><br/>I've chosen flexible funding meaning I receive all the money that is contributed because every little bit will help me get closer to showing at BCAF.<br/><br/>If I don't raise the full amount, I will spend the money contributed in the order listed above.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"">We're offering up a Thank You photo from the Briggs family, magnets, signed prints, exclusive jewelry, assemblage sculptures and custom artwork.</span><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""> Please see the sidebar for details.<br/><br/></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contributing to my campaign will help me fulfill my ultimate dream as an artist to be totally independent and not need two jobs (like I work now). I seek to make art full-time and make enough money to pay myself what I deserve and need to live freely, re-invest in my company, and give back to the community.<br/><br/>After exhibiting once in BCAF, I will received preferred registration for future festivals and adding multiple years at BCAF to my artistic credentials will be huge in building my name.<br/><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute money, please contribute a few seconds by using the IndieGoGo share tools to spread the word about my campaign. The more people that hear about me and my art, the better a chance I have of meeting my goal.<br/><br/>Thanks so much!</p>

This is one of the top ten art festivals in the United States and you must apply at least 6 months in advance to exhibit there.Exhibiting at the BCAF has been one of my big artistic dreams, but the costs associated with setting up my booth (part of the application process is a photo of your booth with all your art set up in it) and also producing enough art and jewelry to fill a 10'x10' booth for a high-volume sales show like BCAF have been prohibitive.


What We Need & What You Get
I am asking for $6000 for the following expenses:* my booth and displays ($1500);* my application & entry fees to Bayou City ($500);* limited edition giclee prints of my artwork ($750);* promotional materials ($500);* classes and workshops for jewelry-makers ($750);* bulk wholesale orders of art & jewelry supplies ($1600); and* packaging supplies for my online & market sales ($400).
Any additional amount that I raise will go towards upgrading my booth, more prints, more supplies & more entries into local & regional markets.I've chosen flexible funding meaning I receive all the money that is contributed because every little bit will help me get closer to showing at BCAF.If I don't raise the full amount, I will spend the money contributed in the order listed above.
Rewards
We're offering up a Thank You photo from the Briggs family, magnets, signed prints, exclusive jewelry, assemblage sculptures and custom artwork. Please see the sidebar for details.


The Impact
Contributing to my campaign will help me fulfill my ultimate dream as an artist to be totally independent and not need two jobs (like I work now). I seek to make art full-time and make enough money to pay myself what I deserve and need to live freely, re-invest in my company, and give back to the community.After exhibiting once in BCAF, I will received preferred registration for future festivals and adding multiple years at BCAF to my artistic credentials will be huge in building my name.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute money, please contribute a few seconds by using the IndieGoGo share tools to spread the word about my campaign. The more people that hear about me and my art, the better a chance I have of meeting my goal.Thanks so much!

It is important for me to be creating work that impacts the human experience and stimulates imaginative and playful spaces. In 2011, I participated in the build of a 30 foot metal based pyramid for Harvest Festival in Burk’s Falls, Canada. Working on the pyramid has given me the base knowledge and first hand experience to bring a 14 foot geometric pussy to life! I’m so excited to be part of creating the Meownge and giving you the purrrrrfect space to play in. Christopher David - Industrial DesignerHi! I am Chris, an enthusiastic 20 something year old with the passion for automobiles, design & creating massive cat heads. I can be found exploring my home of San Francisco with a sketchbook in hand and a strong coffee in the other. Outside of the studio you will find me riding my bike over the Golden Gate Bridge or driving down the Pacific Coast Highway to my hometown of Santa Cruz. Wherever I go I stay close to my designer heart, observing  and analysing, helping to create a brighter future with fun, utilitarian products. Jared Mednick - Illumination EngineerI’ve been interested in making a major contribution using my skills to Burning Man for a long while.  Personally, I come from an engineering background and I love making cool shit!  The Playa leaves an impression on me through the melding and mixing of creative and practical pursuits that manifests itself into Playa Art.  I’ve been helping to herd this group of cats for a while now and am super stoked to see us giving back to the playa in a major way!   Tara Simmons - Community OutreachI am a fun loving, pickling, welding, Oakland chick who loves to throw a good party. My role within the Meownge is to help build the structure and FUNdraise! My 9-5 has me sitting at a desk assisting a team of bankers but my passion outside of the office is connecting with people and showing everyone how fun life can by co-ordinating special events. For the Meownge, I am working alongside a team of strong-willed and talented individuals that are putting together fundraisers across the Bay Area to help cover some of the costs of the Meownge. Mike Halliday - Assistant BuilderHi, my name is Mike Halliday, I live in Oakland, CA and I'm helping to bring the Meownge to Burning Man. Working in finance, I like to spend my free time away from the office, contributing and creating art. When Dan and Hanna approached me with the opportunity to help build a 14' cat head, I was instantly sold. Since then, with the help of a diverse group of Kittehs, skillful volunteers, and a supportive community, I have been spending the previous months cutting, flattening, drilling, sculpting and creating the Meownge. I hope you get to experience it for yourself.....meow
