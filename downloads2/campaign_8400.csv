photographing different places and cultures and writing about my 
experiences. This is how I earn my livelihood. You can find links to 
some of my travel stories on davidjoshuajennings.com<br/><br/><div>
<p>Yesterday 
morning I flew into Colombo, Sri Lanka, to spend one month traveling 
around, photographing and writing about the country. Unfortunately, 
shortly after I left the airport my camera bag, which contained all my 
camera equipment, my passport, my phone and my wallet with all my money 
and debit cards, was stolen while I was at the bus station in Colombo. </p>
<p>Thus
 I find myself marooned for 30 days in one of the most beautiful islands
 in the world, with little money and no camera, unable to do my work or even simply capture its beauty.</p>
<p>In
 an attempt to turn this negative experience into something positive, I 
thought I would use the theft as an impetus to create art. I would like 
to raise money for another camera, and then, inspired by contributors, 
dedicate the next two months of my travels to capturing high-quality 
artistic prints to send to them.</p>
<p>After 30 days in Sri Lanka, I 
will be flying to New York, then traveling via Greyhound to Chicago and 
Madison, then hitchhiking with a friend through South Dakota, Minnesota 
and Wyoming, down to Boulder, Colorado, and then onto Oklahoma. Along the
 way, if I raise enough for a new camera and traveling funds, I will be 
capturing images that I will post online to my website (along with 
around 100 or so of my photographs from the last few years). From these,
 contributors can choose whichever images they like, and I will mail 
them the print size according to their donation.</p>
<p>As a preview, 
here are some of the images I've taken during the previous few months of
 travel, all of which will be available (along with hundreds more)
 on my website after the funds have been raised. Contributors will also be added to the mailing list, where will I will post updates, stories and photographs from the journey that their contributions allowed me to continue.<br/></p>

Since our inception in January 2010 we have made multiple trips to Haiti and have recently launched a Visiting Artist Program, creating a sustainable way for artists in any medium to share their creativity with our kids and project partners as we strive towards our mission to inspire, heal and improve the quality of life for children in need.Other Ways You Can HelpCan't donate now, but still want to participate?

<p>My dad, Richard, was commissioned to
reproduce a 20''X30'' poster, and he knew the easiest way to accurately render
the poster would be to use the grid drawing system. It’s a tedious process, and
after finishing the poster Richard wondered if he could improve the grid-drawing
process by removing the need to draw and erase the grid.</p>
<p>Flash forward some days later and
Richard is in his garage playing with an old painting frame. He gets the
thought to weave a string grid across the frame.  A few prototypes later
and Richard Hudson invents Grid Master, a draw-through, reusable, string grid.</p>
<p>Richard took Grid Master to our local
Jerry's Artarama, and spoke with the store manager who then presented it to the
Executive President of Jerry's Artarama, Ira Goldstein.  Mr. Goldstein liked
Grid Master and its application, but there is nothing like it on the market. </p>
<p>So we need your help to show that the
world is ready for Grid Master. We'd love to see people's advocacy for the grid
drawing technique, and we need enough money to send Grid Master to manufactures
to meet a domestic and international demand.</p>
<p>With your help, everyone in the world

says, “It’s helped my drawing ability. It raised the level from <i>not very good drawing</i> to <b><i>very</i></b><i> good</i>. I wouldn’t even have continued
drawing because of my own self-critique. However, Grid Master keeps everything
in proportion. Without it I would not have developed nearly as large a body of
work as I have.”</p>
<p>My story is similar.  For many years I doubted my drawing ability
because what I drew never seemed real enough, proportionate or accurately rendered. Eventually
through perservering, I became decent at drawing. When my dad gave me my own
Grid Master, I saw that a lot of the hesitancy diminished and my inner-critic
quieted, and I too have started making so many more drawings. </p>

We hope to connect our audience to the emotional and historical sides to these dishes through illustration and writings.

Through this collection of art and writing, we aim to serve up familiar dishes with their rich historical context to humanize our communities and deepen our relationships with food and each other.</p><p>Early February 2018, we put out a call reaching out to the greater AAPI communities in search of AAPI illustrators to interpret a dish and/or ingredient from their culture as a full-page illustration.

Our diverse communities have created foods that serve as a record to reflect our resilience through long histories of colonialism and migration. We hope to connect our audience to the emotional and historical sides to these dishes through illustration and writings. Each illustration is accompanied by an abridged history on that dish that details its journey to what we are familiar with today. Through this collection of art and writing, we aim to serve up familiar dishes with their rich historical context to humanize our communities and deepen our relationships with food and each other.Early February 2018, we put out a call reaching out to the greater AAPI communities in search of AAPI illustrators to interpret a dish and/or ingredient from their culture as a full-page illustration. We were so impressed by everyone’s pitches and was so grateful to have received just under 200 submissions.We believe that this project is fuel for the soul in this age of racial and socioeconomic justice. Through artists’ interpretations of these dishes, we hope to visualize their significance and as an extension, the significance of ourselves and our people. We invite you to join us in cooking up a delicious and filling zine for our friends and communities. Here is a list of the dishes that will be explored in this edition of Family Style Zine, as chosen by our artists:

Some of you (those who have been following my progress online) have also asked me for prints of some of the cards, so I will have a limited number of these on offer also. Without your help I do not have the funds to create the decks, so your support in this really is vital to birth these cards.Even if you cannot help at this time, I’d be grateful if you felt moved to share my campaign with anyone you think might be excited by it. Once the funds are raised I will start the process of printing with my UK based printers. This is a one-woman ship, so I may need you to all bear with me a little as I juggle twins, daughter and shipping. But I will keep everyone updated on what’s happening with your cards as we go along.      A final word to thank everyone who modelled for me in this project. Each and every incredible person is an artist, activist, magician, performer or several of these…Please take a look at the work which they do to see why I found them so inspiring: Ru Callendar (High Priest)   http://www.thegreenfuneralcompany.co.uk/p/about Jiordi Rosales (Justice) http://www.emergencenetwork.org/vulture/ Reama Airoud (Mother) https://www.instagram.com/deaddeadlovely/ Tarn Scully (Hanged)  https://theatrebristol.net/person/tarn-scully/ Andy Letcher (Hermit) www.andyletcher.co.uk Bayo Akomolafe (Father) http://bayoakomolafe.net/ Julian Vayne (Magician) https://theblogofbaphomet.com Nomita Khatri (Strength) https://nomitakhatri.com/ Will Secretan (Devil) http://www.psycheandsoma.org Jade Moon (Priestess) http://earthsmokebonesong.co.uk/jade-moon Daisy Eris Campbell (Discord) https://cosmictriggerplay.com/ Josh Levontine (Fool)",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are Sweet Ditch, a group of female artists who have joined creative forces to put on an exciting and diverse show this summer, with more exhibitions to come in both London and New York.We have artists ranging from painters and illustrators to film makers, sculptors and live performers. Our first show is about raw, original artwork. Work that is not trying to be anything other than honest and courageous. As Sweet Ditch, we set out to challenge and inspire one another, and hopefully our audiences too. We are proud of the work that has been born out of of this supportive multi-disciplinary environment and can't wait to show you.We hope the uncompromising nature of our art will strike a cord with men and women who for whatever reasons are not making the art inside them. We want to inspire people to create no matter what.A little about the Artists....Kate Rubens-  Kate is a London and New York based artist, a painter and dancer who has spent the last few years drawing comparisons between both forms of art. In her practice she focuses predominantly on the female form creating work which draws on her environment and the changeable relationship she has with her body.  www.katerubens.tumblr.com                                            Nicole Cataldo-Davies- Nicole has in this instance put aside her artistic direction, choreography and live action in order to delve a little more selfishly into her own trials and tribulations of being in the world. Trained in traditional arts, social sculpture and drinking cups of hot water, she is returning to the realm of sculptural installation in an attempt to marriage her performance and participatory work with a tongue and cheek exploration into 
'immanence'.  www.nicolecataldo-davies.com                   Christina Hardinge- Christina is an artist and filmmaker  based in London. Christina's work bears a powerful personal imprint. Marked by a fascination with both children and the elderly, her films are low on dialogue and explicit story exposition. Instead, they look to bold, unusual images, vivid details and an acute use of sound design to create their unsettling worlds.  www.christinahardinge.com                    Laura Adamson- Laura is a fine artist and teacher living and working in North London. For the forthcoming Sweet Ditch show Laura will be exhibiting a series of paintings of the important men in her life past and present. Laura is also devising a performance piece that will be shown alongside the paintings.                India Banks- India is an artist, designer and director for theatre and film in addition to devising and performing with CRANK Theatre. The performance art and theatre she creates is rooted in satire, fusing dark humour with commentary on social issues. She has also worked with young people and vulnerable adults in the fields of devised theatre and design. She has recently started working in the fields of documentary film and music videos. She is currently doing a part-time MA at SOAS which combines filmmaking with development studies, ethnomusicology and study of the global arts industries.               Maria Bird- Maria’s artwork sits somewhere between drawing, collage and sculpture. Her work is often tangled and hard to see all at once, asking for a more self-conscious form of looking from the viewer. The moving surface drags the eye through different channels and pathways, forcing the viewer to re-enact the making process to grasp the full picture. Maria Bird wants the viewer to share in the choices, focus and stamina the piece required, and to get a clear feeling for the energy and emotion behind it as well.                                    Anthea Clarke- Anthea is a singer, songwriter, fashion designer and artist based in London. Currently working on projects that explore desire, how it makes us feel and the positive and negative impact it has on our lives.   www.facebook.com/iamfya - http://www.mytribefashion.co.uk                                        Martina Ziewe- Martina is a London based artist. She predominantly paints, more recent work has crossed over into installation and performance. Martina is presently exploring the line between the physical and spiritual, making visceral work that comes from the gut. She is curious about the creative impulse and process of art and life continually feeding back and informing one another on what it is to be alive.                                           Heather Nelson- Heather is an artist based in Hackney, London. She studied a degree in Sculpture at Camberwell School of Arts, but since leaving she has focused mainly on painting. Using oil paints, she conveys her thoughts and interactions through metaphorical imagery. The actual imagery used always has personal meaning to her life but is redefined to represent something else.  http://mixedcomposition.blogspot.co.uk/                                          Carrie Topley-  Carrie is an artist that uses both her background in music and dance to inform her practice. Previous work has involved taking visual data and turning this into musical scores, often using violin, vocals and the use of loops and effects pedals. The line where music/rhythm meets the body as a performance tool is where most of her exploration into live work stems from.                            Eddie Hecht- Eddie usually works in TV and film in the art department, however prefers to identify herself as a 'maker' whose goal is to collect as many creative skills across as many mediums as she can.

<p>We’re Chris and Lynden, and we make pretty steel things in Austin, Texas. We also like burning stuff, which we happen to do a lot in making those things. Our approach to bladesmithing has evolved as a natural progression from our interests in martial arts, military history, and metallurgy, which we combined with our love of hitting things and playing with fire. Eventually, we discovered that working with steel to create blades and other pieces of art was our spiritual calling--we couldn’t stop shaping metal if we tried.</p>
<p>Unlike your typical department store knife, every piece we create is done by hand, without the use of a CNC machine (we, for a change, will not welcome our robot overlords). While we’ll occasionally use a grinder here and there, we try our best to use the same methods medieval bladesmiths did back a few centuries ago. What this means is that along with being prettier and more personalized, our blades are more durable and hold an edge for far longer than your average $20 stainless steel knife.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why we need your help</strong></em></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As you can see in the video, our setup is pretty quaint. Don’t get us wrong, we’re not complaining, we love our little hovel, but we could use some tools to help expedite our process. Right now, we’re looking to add a digital kiln, which allows us to experiment mad scientist-style with really precise processes we couldn’t do otherwise.Like making pocket and kitchen knives. The railroad track is cool and all, but we’re also looking to pick up a better anvil which will make forging easier and more precise. A more precise grinder would also speed up our turnaround exponentially. Now, this doesn’t mean we’ll start cutting corners, or that we’ll let quality slip: we take too much pride in our work to allow that to happen. It does mean we’ll be able to produce knives more quickly and charge less for them, which seems like a win-win to us.</span></p>
<p>If we have money left over from buying tools, we’ll start applying that to bright shiny new steel, pretty woods, and other assorted materials. We’ll also start expanding out the shop, so the both of us can work in there at the same time without <span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">tripping over Chris’ hair</span> getting in each other’s way.</p>
<p>Lastly, your funds will help us continue to do what we do. We both have other side jobs along with bladesmithing so we can pay the bills, but both of us would love to focus more on creating our art and less on how to make ends meet. The ultimate goal is to be able to make knives and other pieces of steel art full time. We’re not looking to get rich, we just wanna be able to live off of what we do.</p>
<p><em><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong><strong>Updates/Webisodes</strong></em></p>

You’ll get to watch us work in the shop while we explain the processes behind making these blades, and see us try not to make fools of ourselves as we take part in panel discussions at different conventions.

<p>My name is Julian Scalia and I am Sculptor and Video Artist.  I have started this campaign to raise funds for <strong>The Throne Of Visions </strong>my newest sculpture for Burning Man 2013.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THE THRONE OF VISIONS?</strong></p>
<p>It is a multimedia interactive experience designed specifically for Burning Man’s 2013 theme; Cargo Cult.  The Throne of Visions is a trans-dimensional device that allows the user to view sights in the etheric realm.  It takes the form of a regal chair with a strange dystopian viewing apparatus attached at its crown.  Housed in the epicenter of Burning Man, this piece of Homegrown Technology will be on display for 50,000 people to interact with.  It is the philosopher’s alchemical throne, a gift of modern technology for the mystics and diviners.</p>
<p><strong>WAIT?  WHAT THE HELL IS A ETHERIC VISION DEVICE?!</strong></p>
<p>I am building the Throne of Visions to remind people of a perception just outside our own reality.  Using the old occult language of Paracelsus and the elementals, the Throne of Visions will enable viewers to interact with the unseen world of fantasy.    I am repurposing old turn of the century theater tricks to create what I call <em>Analog Augmented Reality</em>.  A magical miracle that will remind us of our societies roots in this age of Google Glass.  I hope the Throne of Visions will offer a refreshing glimpse into the fantasy of our psyche, igniting curiosity in the wonders of our physical realm.  I would love to tell you more about how it works but I can’t reveal all my secrets!<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHY I NEED YOUR HELP? </strong></p>
<p>I am a young artist who has always dreamt of bringing a large piece of artwork to the playa.  This year the Burning Man organization has approved my proposal for the Throne of Visions!  But I need your help to give my project that extra oomph. Unlike many of the large-scale, high budget projects at Burning Man, the Throne of Visions is unfortunately not partially funded by an art grant.  Nor do I have the support system of veteran theme camps and high tech wizards.  Instead she is a modest project with big dreams; lovingly hand crafted by a small group of volunteers and myself the artist.  It is with your help that this project will truly manifest and become alive.  Help us with our Promethean task and breathe life into a visionary dream.</p>
<p><strong>HOW I’ll SPEND YOUR DONATIONS… </strong></p>
<p>The Funds raised will go towards cutting the costs of all my materials.  I will spend your dime on every inch of my materials.  Your money will be used: </p>
<ul>
<li>On lumber, resin, glass and box of women’s panty hos  </li>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p></div>","Hi Indegogoers! 
My name is Julian Scalia and I am Sculptor and Video Artist.  I have started this campaign to raise funds for The Throne Of Visions my newest sculpture for Burning Man 2013.
WHAT IS THE THRONE OF VISIONS?
It is a multimedia interactive experience designed specifically for Burning Man’s 2013 theme; Cargo Cult.  The Throne of Visions is a trans-dimensional device that allows the user to view sights in the etheric realm.  It takes the form of a regal chair with a strange dystopian viewing apparatus attached at its crown.  Housed in the epicenter of Burning Man, this piece of Homegrown Technology will be on display for 50,000 people to interact with.  It is the philosopher’s alchemical throne, a gift of modern technology for the mystics and diviners.
WAIT?  WHAT THE HELL IS A ETHERIC VISION DEVICE?!
I am building the Throne of Visions to remind people of a perception just outside our own reality.  Using the old occult language of Paracelsus and the elementals, the Throne of Visions will enable viewers to interact with the unseen world of fantasy.    I am repurposing old turn of the century theater tricks to create what I call Analog Augmented Reality.  A magical miracle that will remind us of our societies roots in this age of Google Glass.  I hope the Throne of Visions will offer a refreshing glimpse into the fantasy of our psyche, igniting curiosity in the wonders of our physical realm.  I would love to tell you more about how it works but I can’t reveal all my secrets! 
WHY I NEED YOUR HELP? 
I am a young artist who has always dreamt of bringing a large piece of artwork to the playa.  This year the Burning Man organization has approved my proposal for the Throne of Visions!  But I need your help to give my project that extra oomph. Unlike many of the large-scale, high budget projects at Burning Man, the Throne of Visions is unfortunately not partially funded by an art grant.  Nor do I have the support system of veteran theme camps and high tech wizards.  Instead she is a modest project with big dreams; lovingly hand crafted by a small group of volunteers and myself the artist.  It is with your help that this project will truly manifest and become alive.  Help us with our Promethean task and breathe life into a visionary dream.
HOW I’ll SPEND YOUR DONATIONS… 
The Funds raised will go towards cutting the costs of all my materials.  I will spend your dime on every inch of my materials.  Your money will be used: 

On lumber, resin, glass and box of women’s panty hos  
On each and every screw, nail, bolt and washer
to help afford expensive electronics like LED lights, LCD monitors and batteries used to power the interactive portion of Throne of Visions 
On transportation:  your funds will help transport this tiny beast into the middle of the barren Black Rock Desert. 
Even if my $2500 goal is not reached your money will be put to good use.  Equally allotted to all my different needs each dime will help lift the financial burden of this titanic endeavor.
Thanks for taking a look at my campaign!
Every donation made will be massively appreciated. 
I have spent a lot of time putting together amazing gifts for those of you who donate.  Each tier will receive a personalized thank you postcard and there are many other amazing hand crafted gifts that I hope will make you feel a part of our family.

<p>My name is Kevin Jesuino. I am a digital media and performance based artist. In May 2013 I will produce a site-specific projection/performance art piece in Tondela, Portugal as part of an artist residnecy with ARTerra Artist Residency. </p>
<p>Inspired by community, along with my connection a sense of displacement as a Portuguese citizen who grew up most of his life in Canada but who still feels culturally Portuguese, I hope to create a public projection art performance. The piece will evolve out of experience in returning to the country of my ancestors and investigating what it means to be part of the Tondela community. Research will be undertaken regarding  particular community based issues specific to the people of that municipality. In past projects in which I involve myself in the community in this manner I have produced projects that question notions of the effects of gentrification, cultural identity, post-humanism, environmental concerns, and humans relationship to technology.</p>
<p>The projection will be created using 3D mapping software, my laptop and a projector. All of these tools will accompany me from Canada to this residency. I speak Portuguese quite fluently and am prepared to do my own investigation of the community and it’s current issues -- politically, socially and economically. </p>

<p>With a portfolio that encompasses all aspects of light art including; permanent installations, temporary interventions, interactive projects, public art, light sculptures and bespoke fabrications, the <strong><em>River of Light</em></strong> is one of our most renowned projects. </p>
<p>In 2010 it was recognised as one of the top 50 public arts projects during the Public Art Network Year for 2010, after 10,000 people witnessed the work on the Bow River, Calgary, Canada. </p>

<p>For Red Deer this is the <strong>Light Barrel. </strong></p>

<p>Since our first visit to the city we have been exploring how the rain barrel can become a symbolic, visual, structural-sculptural, modular ‘object’ by transforming it through light, into a <strong>light barrel</strong>.</p>
<p>Mapping the historical, social and scientific context of the Red Deer river, the <strong>light barrel</strong> represents and responds to the ‘water use’ as a global issue through the local perspective by becoming the basis for this one off-event whilst illuminating issues surrounding water preservation.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>River of Light</em> campaign</strong> therefore aims to engage anyone, whether a Red Deer citizen, a water conversation expert or a public art enthusiast, in supporting river conversation and water preservation by helping us to illuminate those issues.  </p>
<p><strong>Today we are asking for your support to help us create the light barrels that will make up the <em>River of Light </em>and continue to spread this message.<em> </em></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why support the <em>River of Light</em> Campaign?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>With your help we can make this <em>River of Light</em> bigger, more spectacular and more far-reaching than ever.  </strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise <strong>$CD 50,000</strong> to produce the light barrels that will travel down the Red Deer River on the 30th June 2013 and will then be given to the Red Deer community as a gift and as a commitment to sustainable water preservation. </p>

<p>Our great list of perks has something for everyone, whether you are an individual, organsiation or businesses from Red Deer, from Canada or from somewhere else in the world, there is a perk for you.  </p>

<p>On top of that, to mark the International Year of Water Co-operation, 5% of your contribution will be donated to UN Water, meaning that in supporting the <strong><em>River of Light</em> campaign</strong> you will not only be creating a unique event for Red Deer you will also be directly supporting a global campaign for water preservation. </p>
<p><strong>The more money we can raise, the larger the installation, the greater the investment for the community and the more far-reaching the message can be.</strong></p>
<h3>How will we use your contribution?</h3>
<p>The <strong><em>River of Light</em></strong> has been commissioned by Central Alberta Historical Society, from whom we have secured a proportion of funding to deliver this project alongside a series of citywide installations and interventions. </p>
<p>To deliver the<strong><em> River of Light</em> </strong>element of our citywide light festival we need to raise $CD 50,000 to produce the light barrels. </p>
<p>We have calculated that each light barrel will cost $CD 95 to purchase, modify with a lighting component and assemble. </p>
<p>Your contribution will therefore go directly to transformation and gifting of 500 light barrels.  </p>

<h3>Why we believe the <em>River of Light</em> will be a success?</h3>
<p>What has really stood out to us about the <strong><em>River of Light</em></strong> is the impact it has on the communities it travels to. </p>
<p><img alt=""River of Light - Kayakers on the Bow River"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/679388/pictures/full/20130226085824-River_of_Light_Presentation.jpg?1361897913"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""River of Light - Kayakers on the Bow River""/></p>
<p>In the 1st <strong><em>River of Light</em></strong> for the River Thames in London, UK in 2008, 50 spheres were personalised by children from two local schools to connect communities from both sides of the River. </p>
<p>In Calgary, Canada, the <strong><em>River of Light</em></strong> was witnessed by over 10,000 people, but was also created by over 100 volunteers who helped make the light spheres and launch them on the Bow River. As writer Linda Hawkins said about this event:</p>
<p><em><strong>“</strong>...the universal appeal of this event was clear. The pathways and riverbanks were full of people. Some settled in on lawn chairs with refreshments, as if at a sporting event. Others pedaled bicycles or abandoned them to perch right at the water’s edge. There was conversation but mostly there was stillness. A sense of wonder pervaded as, silently, the multicoloured constellation emerged from the surrounding blackness. The spheres converged and dispersed, mapping the river’s topography as they disappeared around islands and materialized back into view. Illuminating the river’s flow patterns, the spheres symbolized water molecules on their journey from source to city. Part performance piece, part installation, this artwork cast the river as both setting and lead performer.<strong>”</strong></em></p>
<p>Because we place community at the heart of the <strong><em>River of Light</em></strong>, we know that local people will come together to share in this experience.  </p>
<p>What is unique about the <strong><em>River of Light</em> campaign </strong>however is now people from all over the world can come together to celebrate the worlds rivers.  </p>

The River of Light campaign therefore aims to engage anyone, whether a Red Deer citizen, a water conversation expert or a public art enthusiast, in supporting river conversation and water preservation by helping us to illuminate those issues.  
Today we are asking for your support to help us create the light barrels that will make up the River of Light and continue to spread this message. 
Why support the River of Light Campaign?
With your help we can make this River of Light bigger, more spectacular and more far-reaching than ever.  
Our goal is to raise $CD 50,000 to produce the light barrels that will travel down the Red Deer River on the 30th June 2013 and will then be given to the Red Deer community as a gift and as a commitment to sustainable water preservation. 

Our great list of perks has something for everyone, whether you are an individual, organsiation or businesses from Red Deer, from Canada or from somewhere else in the world, there is a perk for you.  
To show the investment you have made to the future of the town and water conversation, everyone who donates will be added to the River of Light World Water Supporter's Map.  
With the aim of shining a light on water preservation on a global scale the map shows the name's and locations of everyone that has contributed to the River of Light.  

On top of that, to mark the International Year of Water Co-operation, 5% of your contribution will be donated to UN Water, meaning that in supporting the River of Light campaign you will not only be creating a unique event for Red Deer you will also be directly supporting a global campaign for water preservation. 
The more money we can raise, the larger the installation, the greater the investment for the community and the more far-reaching the message can be.
How will we use your contribution?
The River of Light has been commissioned by Central Alberta Historical Society, from whom we have secured a proportion of funding to deliver this project alongside a series of citywide installations and interventions. 
To deliver the River of Light element of our citywide light festival we need to raise $CD 50,000 to produce the light barrels. 
We have calculated that each light barrel will cost $CD 95 to purchase, modify with a lighting component and assemble. 
Your contribution will therefore go directly to transformation and gifting of 500 light barrels.  

Why we believe the River of Light will be a success?
What has really stood out to us about the River of Light is the impact it has on the communities it travels to. 

In the 1st River of Light for the River Thames in London, UK in 2008, 50 spheres were personalised by children from two local schools to connect communities from both sides of the River. 
In Calgary, Canada, the River of Light was witnessed by over 10,000 people, but was also created by over 100 volunteers who helped make the light spheres and launch them on the Bow River. As writer Linda Hawkins said about this event:
“...the universal appeal of this event was clear. The pathways and riverbanks were full of people. Some settled in on lawn chairs with refreshments, as if at a sporting event. Others pedaled bicycles or abandoned them to perch right at the water’s edge. There was conversation but mostly there was stillness. A sense of wonder pervaded as, silently, the multicoloured constellation emerged from the surrounding blackness. The spheres converged and dispersed, mapping the river’s topography as they disappeared around islands and materialized back into view. Illuminating the river’s flow patterns, the spheres symbolized water molecules on their journey from source to city. Part performance piece, part installation, this artwork cast the river as both setting and lead performer.”
Because we place community at the heart of the River of Light, we know that local people will come together to share in this experience.  
What is unique about the River of Light campaign however is now people from all over the world can come together to celebrate the worlds rivers.  
How else can you support the River of Light Campaign?

<p>Ok, now that you have wiped the tears away, let's talk about what is going on.  This message is going to be directed specifically to the friends and family of Relapse Theatre as well as their friends and family.  Anyone else who is inspired to donate,  you will then be considered part of the family.  We are directing it at you because we want to rally those of us that have been to battle together, that know the importance of this theatre, and that refuse to allow an emptiness take over where greatness should stand.</p>
<p><strong>Friends And Family Of Relapse, We Need You, More Than We Ever Have Before.</strong></p>
<p>Most of you already know that as of now, our beloved theatre that is like a home to all of us, has been shut down.   Unless we unite to do something about it, it will stay that way....forever.  Here is the thing about when you lose something important.  It sucks.  It sucks really bad.  But it isn't until much later when you look back, and remember that amazing thing that you once had and took for granted, that you truly feel the impact of what you really lost.</p>
<p>Our loss is fresh, and it is sad.  But if you think it is sad now, wait until a year from now, five years from now, even ten years from now, when that old, dirty church that you once occupied for the purposes of improving the lives of others through laughter, still sits empty.  It is then, when it is too late, that the impact of what you really lost will hit you like a ton of bricks.   </p>
<p>There is a reason that we all come together at Relapse.  It is unlike any other place in the world.  It is a comedy community like no other.  It is revolutionary, and it is ground breaking.  And in order to accomplish something that changes the world for the better, you are going to face massive obstacles.  That is why revolutions aren't easy.  But we have something that most people who attempt revolutions don't have.  We have Bob Wood.  If Bob Wood were alive during the American Revolution, he would be the face we all see on our dollar bills.  And when you have a man like that on YOUR side, you pick him up when he is down.  God knows he has picked every single one of us up a million times over.  In fact, in keeping Relapse open the past 8 or so years, Bob has thrown us all on his back and carried us over obstacles more difficult than any of us could really imagine.  And what has Bob asked for in return?  Only one thing.....that we continue chasing our dream.  That we NEVER let those outside forces that do nothing but tell us that we can never succeed as performers, break our spirit and cause us to quit.  </p>
<p>Since the day I met Bob, he has been been absolutely determined to change the entire world for the better through comedy.  And some, who are not in this industry, who have a ""safe"" regular job, might smirk and call that dream silly.  Well, to anyone who has ever thought that, I challenge you.  I challenge you to provide evidence, hard evidence, not an opinion you formed based on a misconception, that proves to us that laughter is bad for you, that laughter does not bring people together, that laughter does not make us feel better in our darkest hour.  Prove that to me, and I'll quit.  But that is not going to happen, because in this world that we live in, we have to laugh, we have to love, we have to see light through the darkness.  If we don't...What else is there?  </p>
<p>Bob Wood is a rare person who not only understands the importance of this, but also has the ability to use this to affect a positive influence across a nation.  Imagine if all of us helped Bob just a little bit.</p>
<p>Imagine if we removed some of that burden that Bob so often faces, and we shouldered some of those difficulties ourselves, allowing him to focus on using his amazing talents to move us forward, beyond limits any of us could ever imagine.  Imagine if this theatre that, despite it's struggles, has already created a ripple affect across the country, were able to reach it's true potential.  For me, that is a much more desirable thing to imagine, than an old, broke down building, filled with nothing but squandered dreams.</p>
<p>We must not allow all of ours and Bob's effort to be rendered moot.  If we can accomplish this, then we will have proven that when we really work together, we can do anything, especially live our dreams.  The organizational structure to push Relapse to the next level was set in motion before this all happened.  We aren't far away, but in order to get over this mountain, it is going to have to be us who lifts Bob, the man who has carried us all for so long, up onto our shoulders, and carries him.  I don't know about you, but I'm honored to do it.  </p>
<p>Bob did not ask us to do this.  He refuses to accept handouts.  The only way we were able to get him to not stop us from doing this was by convincing him that not one cent of this is a handout, because it isn't.  Bob has given us all enough free classes, free rehearsal space, free stage use, and a million other things that everyone else in the world would charge us money for.  This is not a handout.  This is simply us paying him back for everything he has ever done.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><strong>The Amount We Need And Why</strong> </p>
<p>From the details I know of why Relapse was shut down, it was because of a perfect storm of circumstances. All at once, an outstanding water bill that we were unaware of, an increased building tax bill, the building insurance bill, and the bill for our necessary renewal of all of our permits, including the liquor license, slammed into Relapse unexpectedly.  </p>
<p>Yes, poor planning was a factor, but the irony is that some of the confusion was caused by some really exciting behind the scenes steps that were being put into place to catapult Relapse to new levels that would prevent this very thing from happening.   </p>
<p>Our target goal is $80,000.  </p>
<p>The first $50,000 is to cover all of those bills that came in. </p>
<p>The other $30,000 is for a buffer while we implement those theatre wide strategies that will ensure a consistent cash flow that gives us long term stability.     </p>
<p>Any donation, no matter how large or small will be greatly appreciated.  And it will give you the ability to smile, and look back years from now, when Relapse is a household name all over the world, and say, ""I played a part in the Relapse Comedy Revolution.""</p>

Brandon Pass Architect is a small multidisciplinary practice pursuing an architecture that recognizes the responsibilities of the built form where environmental, social and contextual factors shape each insertion into a given landscape. Architecture should seek to express a given function through a strong clarity of space and form where the details become expressive and exploratory, respecting the hand of the maker while expressing a connection to a greater whole. The responsibility of the architect, in part, is to be aware of all factors of a given context that may inform the design process. It requires an extensive knowledge of and desire to learn new methodologies creating architecture of the highest quality respectful of both time and place.</span></span></p>

Reflective expanded aluminum shade cloth, typically used in greenhouse, will cover the Spirit House to give a reflective surface. Light from a small campfire will be reflected in the interior, while the exterior will reflect the light of the full moon occurring that night.
 
Each tetrahedral unit requires approximately 150 linear feet of 2x6 lumber; a 60 foot x 20 foot panel of reflective cloth; 40 bolts, nuts and washers; brackets; rope; and other miscellaneous hardware. We are estimating each unit having a $300 cost. Seven tetrahedral units create the intended design for the inhabitable Spirit House, coming to $2100. However, we will construct as many units as funding allows.  We added an additional $400 for truck rental and other surprise expenses.

Brandon Pass Architect is an architecture practice located in Asheville, North Carolina that strives to merge modern sensibilities and detailing with the vernacular influences of the region. Brandon Pass Architect is a small multidisciplinary practice pursuing an architecture that recognizes the responsibilities of the built form where environmental, social and contextual factors shape each insertion into a given landscape. Architecture should seek to express a given function through a strong clarity of space and form where the details become expressive and exploratory, respecting the hand of the maker while expressing a connection to a greater whole. The responsibility of the architect, in part, is to be aware of all factors of a given context that may inform the design process. It requires an extensive knowledge of and desire to learn new methodologies creating architecture of the highest quality respectful of both time and place.

Informed by a former career in New York City’s apparel industry, Libby O’Bryan creates environments for the contemplation of every­day decisions and cultural norms that function outside the commodity driven marketplace. Although asserting a politicized agenda, the aestheticized temporality of her performative/interactive installations provides incentive for its provocative nature. Drawing parallels between craft, the new art economy, and mass-production, she explores the relationships and of maker, machine, and consumer.

<h3>Artistic Intent</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Luchtan, I am a 34 year old American Composer.  I am creating a prepared piano piece for the Black Mountain College {Re}Happening 2013.  During it's existence, Black Mountain College hosted many influential thinkers, teachers, and students, one of which was the avant garde composer John Cage.  Many of his works were focused on pushing the limits of modern compositional language, and pieces like his <em>Sonatas and Interludes</em>  have the performer 'prepare' the piano, inserting pieces of metal and plastic between the strings, requiring them to treat the piano in a non-standard way.  </p>
<p>As a contributer to the Black Mountain College {Re}Happening, I am planning on installing the gutted harp of a piano on a dock on Lake Eden, in the heart of the old Black Mountain College Campus, and further preparing it over the course of the evening by incorporating feedback from the surrounding environment.  I also plan on installing an information panel explaining the specifics of the evening for the attendees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The piano can be seen as a ready labratory for experiments in sound.  In preparing the Lake Eden piano, I will divide the sound spectrum using input from the evenings environment.  After the instrument has been ""tuned"" to Lake Eden, the prepared piano will become, at least for the evening, an interactive sonic sculpture.  </p>
<p>We will use experimental methods to discover the resonant frequency, F, of Lake Eden, and will tune the strings of the piano harp to the overtones and undertones of F, arranging the tones in a fractal pattern.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Budget:</h3>
<p>* Locating and prepping appropriate piano - $200</p>
<p>* Three assistants to transport and install piano - $300</p>
<p>* Lighting - $150</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Experimental Goals</h3>
<p>This experiment in sound continues the work of John Cage in expanding the vocabulary of sound for artistic composition by exploring the interaction of overtones between the instrument and the environment  I hope to contribute to the ever evolving palette of sound that modern composers have at their disposal.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<h3>Some of you guys know, some of you do not, I sold my shop in Noble OK in December and everything in it. Sold most of what I owned and bought a RV to hit the road. Well I loaded that RV up with my paintings, art supplies, my favorite records, books, tapes, family pictures, art my friends made for me, a little piano, my ceramic deer collection, and everything else I gave a damn about. Set out and broke down out of state. I had to abandon the vehicle couldn't get anything out and came back here broke. Its now June I have some prang watercolors and a set of brushes I found in a mobile home. Id like to open another shop I found a building with an apartment in the back for 575 a month in OKC enough for a small thrift store art studio space and a back room to put on art shows and concerts. I need to buy stock and secure the building. I got to thinking people are always asking me to draw portraits of them. It's always a bit hard to get together with money and time and such. What if it only cost a few bucks to do a portrait of you? What if al my friends on FB gave me a dollar and I got to get started on a shop?  </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h3>I need about 1600 bucks to open the shop that is rent deposit permits and stock. That not too much between me working at American Eagle and doing commissions. I could open up and be rocking and rolling in no time. What you'll get is being painted into a watercolor portrait with everyone that is donating. I don't know whether it'll be a big or a small painting depending how many of you get into this. However whether its one or 1000 it'll be fun and cool and you'll get a copy and say hey Spencer finally drew me thats cool. Plus whoever donates the most money will get to have the original painting and hey, thats kick ass bragging rights.  </h3>

<p>Hello! My name is Dmitrious. I’m your average 6’7” giant and this August I’m moving to Montreal, Canada to pursue my dream of becoming a professional circus performer. I’ve been accepted into the BEST circus school in the world: École Nationale de Cirque. I’ve climbed over every obstacle in my path (yes, even couches), and though I am undertrained, I was selected to attend because what I lacked in skill, I made up for in charisma, hard work, and vast potential.</p>
<p>Growing up I was always much bigger than everyone else around me, which was a blessing, but also a curse. More commonly than “Hello” or “How are you?” I was told that I was too big to do all the things that I wanted to do. At 21 I auditioned for the Competitive Dance Reality TV series “So You Think You Can Dance” as a result of a dare from a friend. The result? I appeared on TV and nationally humiliated myself attempting to breakdance. But all was not lost. Something actually clicked that day; rather than giving into the idea that I was “too big” and giving up, I steered completely into the opposite direction and started to train even harder than I had trained before.</p>
<p>After two years of intense training, I was able to control my body and bboy (the right way this time), so I packed up and moved myself to Los Angeles with the idea that I would be dancing there to sustain myself. In Los Angeles, however, I met an amazing woman and mentor who opened my eyes to the idea of training circus. I kind of laughed at the idea at first, I’ll admit. Me? In the circus? That’s crazy!  But it wasn’t long until I knew that I had found my passion—the this was the what I had been searching for all along—a fusion of all of the theatrical, dance, and acrobatic experience I picked up over the years; but above all else, I knew that I had finally found something that I fit into perfectly, a place where I truly belonged, a place where “too big” became “you’re just what we need” and “we’re so glad you’re here”. Needless to say, I fell in love with circus, and now that’s translated through the love I feel as I’m entertaining people and bringing joy to their lives</p>
<p>I love bringing joy and inspiration to people—especially to the kids that I coach. I want to become a professional circus performer. I train roughly 20 – 25 hours a week; this is my life and I love it. Please help my dreams come true. I need 14,000$ to pay for my tuition and the cost of living in Montreal, Canada. The school is closely tied with Cirque du Soleil and working for them is my ultimate goal.</p>
<p><strong>I’m not a freak. What can I do to help?</strong></p>
<p>Please help me train at ENC. I’m a hard worker, I’ve done everything I possibly could to get into this school, but with my current means, paying for the tuition just isn’t possible. I currently work as a circus instructor, teaching circus techniques and performance to my young students, and then perform locally in Los Angeles area (Which all together still means that I barely scrape by L).</p>
<p>Here is the financial damage that I’m currently facing:</p>
<p>The tuition is $7,000 for the entire year. A very reasonable price considering that it’s currently the best circus school in the world and that the Canadian government subsidizes 96% of costs for the school. Thank you, Canada!</p>
<p>But even so, the cost of living will be roughly $700 a month: $500 for rent and then $200 for my food and transportation.</p>
<p>Please sponsor, follow, and support me throughout my incredible journey. Unfortunately I do not have much of a budget for fancy incentives as you can imagine, but I will make you origami (mostly paper animals), send you postcards and headshots, make you videos of my progress, teach you circus, give you hugs, and will eternally be grateful for your kindness. I will make a poster featuring the name of every sponsor and they will be the inspiration to always give it my 150% every day.</p>
<p>If the $1400 is not met, I will still go to Montreal somehow. Quitting is just not in my nature. I am passionate about what I do and giving up is simply not an option. Even if it means that I will be homeless when I get to Montreal; I’m willing to do it. But I really hope it doesn’t have to come down to that.</p>
<p><strong>Giants get old too.</strong></p>
<p>Training at ENC would mean the world to me. They have a strict list of criteria in terms of who gets to attend the school. Besides acrobatics, acting, dance-ability, strength, and coordination, the maximum age to audition is 25 years of age. Since I’m 24, this is actually my one and only chance to achieve this dream of mine; but the good news is that your support can make it happen.</p>
<p>I plan to take the knowledge that I’ll gain better myself as both a coach and a role model to the kids that I teach. I try my best to inspire and to be a constant positive influence to all the children I teach and work with, and this is my chance to prove to them, if not myself, that dreams do come true, and that dreams come true when you reach for something even if it seems “too big” to grasp, or the chance of success “too big” to achieve. I can’t wait to make people smile and spread my love for what I do through performance.</p>
<p>Please donate anything you can, every penny counts. I understand that these times are tough for everybody and that not everybody is in a condition to give themselves. If you don’t have anything to donate, I understand, and I will gladly accept your gift encouragement. If you find yourself in that category, please just pass this along and share it, so that it might find somebody that can. Thank you for reading this! <br/><br/> *GIANT HUG* <br/><br/> (Now I hope that wasn’t “too big” for you).<br/><br/> Sincerely,<br/><br/> Dmitrious Bistrevsky.</p></div>","The Hokey Pokey (that’s what it’s all about)

It is a program of holidays featuring activities and events  that will take place between the 9th to the 15th of August 2012 on the greek island of Anafi. This aegean island is located on the south-east edge of the Cycladic cluster and can be reached only by boat.</h3>
<h3>  This initiative will host artists, curators, writers and friends working on or dealing with the vast landscape of internet culture. This is an international group, coming from different parts of the world but collectively part of a compact online community who believe that the creative integration of the offline and online modes of well-being can spark a liberated intellectual evolution and reveal an all-union of disciplines. I invited people whose work expands notions of communication, distribution, dissemination, compression and simultaneity.</h3>
<h3>  The participants will evaluate and activate ideas of deeper spiritual virtuality, explore and invent new visual codes and behavoural modes, using the island itself as an interface: a new consciousness of time and space. We aspire also to compare Internet social conventions to actual space, minimizing or maximizing the intervention of technology.  </h3>
<h3>Participants are free to realize their projects in any medium: from a workshop to a lecture to a performance to an installation to a video to a website to an mp3, anywhere on the island: by the beach, by the bar, underwater, in the monastery.  </h3>
<h3>The Eternal Internet Brotherhood will provide a “space” of total intellectual liberty and will act as a post-privacy outpost. We will escape from the visual provincialism of technology within which we now live in a meta-internet corporeal idyllic context</h3>

It is a program of holidays featuring activities and events  that will take place between the 9th to the 15th of August 2012 on the greek island of Anafi. This aegean island is located on the south-east edge of the Cycladic cluster and can be reached only by boat.
  This initiative will host artists, curators, writers and friends working on or dealing with the vast landscape of internet culture. This is an international group, coming from different parts of the world but collectively part of a compact online community who believe that the creative integration of the offline and online modes of well-being can spark a liberated intellectual evolution and reveal an all-union of disciplines. I invited people whose work expands notions of communication, distribution, dissemination, compression and simultaneity.
  The participants will evaluate and activate ideas of deeper spiritual virtuality, explore and invent new visual codes and behavoural modes, using the island itself as an interface: a new consciousness of time and space. We aspire also to compare Internet social conventions to actual space, minimizing or maximizing the intervention of technology.  
Participants are free to realize their projects in any medium: from a workshop to a lecture to a performance to an installation to a video to a website to an mp3, anywhere on the island: by the beach, by the bar, underwater, in the monastery.  
The Eternal Internet Brotherhood will provide a “space” of total intellectual liberty and will act as a post-privacy outpost. We will escape from the visual provincialism of technology within which we now live in a meta-internet corporeal idyllic context

Angelo Plessas, 2012

About This Campaign
The Eternal Internet Brotherhood is an artist-run initiative. This means that we are doing this without the support of an institution or any state funding. This has to do with the specifics of the context [Greece in crisis as a microcosm or natural exemplar for the precarity of global hypercapitalism in liquid modernity] but also to do with a shared conviction that funding bodies carry their own agenda which often ends up curtailing artistic autonomy. Most of the artists taking part are not part of the object art economy, preferring to practice in more distributed ways: using our bodies or furnishing spaces or experimenting with new forms of image-making online. We build our community in the mould of Web 2.0; open source sharing, wikiesque knowledge distribution, an economy of affect; in this spirit, we seek assistance from our friends, peers and critics in helping us build an IRL model of the gift economy. 
The money is going towards food and accommodation for the artists while in Anafi. We are partially funding ourselves, as we see this as an important part of setting up an initiative - covering our own travel and a portion of our expenses. But to make it possible for this to work well, we need your help! Please donate generously for the good of post-internet generations to come.

<h3>Our Team  </h3>
<p>The Puzzle Factory Collective is made up a fluid and growing number of volunteers who handle things from social media promotion, event organizing, stage management, gallery curation, and more. Some of these people include, </p>
<ul>
<li>Justin Arena - Printmaker, Musician, and Show Organizer</li>
<li>Ian Garland - Music Promotion, Podcasting, and Show Organizer</li>
<li>Brian Fitzgerald - Stop motion Animation, Musician, Music Promotion</li>
<li>Devri Goodspeed - Fiber Arts, Workshop Organizer </li>
<li>Brian Huntress - Multi Disciplinary Arts, Show Organizer, Music Promotion </li>
</ul>
<p>This represents some of the core group but in no way reflects the extent of our ever growing and irreplaceable number of show goers, volunteers, artists, and musicians. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We're Asking </h3>
<p>Here is our goal in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are asking for $1,500 in donations to get this project off of the ground. This is a flexible goal but this is the optimal number. This money will contribute to the first and last month's rent, and security deposits for the new store front. It will not pay for our time, resources, or personal compensation. This space will be artist owned and operated and funded completely out of pocket by its residents. </li>
<li>Your reward for donations are listed in the options below. These will include all types of options like handmade art, fibers, and/or other band or collective merch. See below for the detailed list. </li>
<li>If we don't reach this goal, the collective will be paying out of pocket for the remaining expenses. This campaign's success will be a massive victory not just for us as a collective but for the Rockland art community as a whole. We plan to welcome artists of all kinds to participate in our future shows, workshops, and events. Regardless of how this goes, we eternally grateful for any help we receive. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Puzzle Factory's End  </h3>
<p>We existed as a DIY venue, community art space, and an unofficial gallery before this current project began. We are SO grateful for all of the opportunities our former location gave us but we've felt for a while thats its time to bring our operation into a more public and accessible place. We cannot yet reveal the exact location of the new space as we're still dotting our I's, but we will soon be operating in a beautiful 1,250 sq ft. store front in Rockland. We are SO excited for all of you to see the new space and to take part in the amazing things we will soon build.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As stated before, this art space will be artist owned and operated, which means that we will rely heavily on the community's generosity for our long term sustainability. Many of us know all too well that an artist's income is not always consistent and hard times may come. With your help, we will be doing our absolute best to keep this place open and operating for as long as we possibly can. We will open this space despite any financial setbacks or the success of this campaign. </p>
<ul>
<li>We believe wholeheartedly that we can fulfill these goals and open a beautiful, community oriented space. </li>
<li>We believe that our community needs a place where its wayward artists and oddballs can flourish without judgement and with total peer support. </li>
<li>We believe that our community will benefit from our presence and we will provide a safe, productive, and unique art space. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>

<h3>The Milk Crate</h3>
<p>I didn't know what to do when I received a milk crate that contained most if not all of Jonathan's sketchbooks, but on top of that there was a small external hard drive. Most of it was unsorted but after some exploration, it became clear that I had nearly all of Jonathan's artwork, in high resolution. I also had a terrible sense of guilt. I transformed it into a project, as is my traditional way of grieving. This guilt was that I had something that needed to be shared. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here are the basics.</p>
<p>I have compiled and curated a large art book that not only spans sketches and paintings, but also seeks to, in what limited capacity I have, publish a small amount of an art book that Jonathan had already started work on. This book is being edited by myself and three others close to him in order to bring you the best that we can provide.</p>
<p>The bulk of the work is done. all we need to do is get it published, and an on-demand printer has already been selected. </p>
<p>The only problem is that the project estimate got more expensive as it expanded. </p>
<p>We are not selling this book for any profit. What we are asking for is a contribution toward the cost of having it printed and shipping. We are offering multiple ways for you to contribute in a communal sense. Not only can you buy yourself as many copies as you care to, you can also buy pieces of books or shipping for others that may be unable to contribute what they want because of this awful hellscape of a year, or perhaps someone finds this too late that was forgotten.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The End Product</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Rather than a standard crowdfunding campaign, we are not offering tiered perks. The price is what the price of each book costs to produce and ship in bulk to us. That price point will not change. If we exceed what we are seeking, excess money will be handled in the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Overall quality improvements to the base book for everyone. Be that better paper, A fancy dust jacket, etc. This will be automatic and you need not do anything to receive a fancier, better quality book.</li>
<li>Creating a small surplus of printed books for latecomers or for emergency replacement.</li>
<li>Anything past what I can get that is suitably fancy and not over the top will be used toward any and all shipping costs to you, where applicable.</li>
<li>Anything past that will buy the editors a bottle of Balvenie DoubleWood 12 year (as is only appropriate).</li>
<li>Anything past that will be donated in memory of Jonathan to a suitable charity, whether it is art or animals.</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge is that we do not raise the totality of what we need to publish this. If this occurs, the only hurdle you will face is having to wait longer for a finished product. If we fall short of our goal, the money will still be collected, set aside, and I will continue to contribute until it is met while offering any pertinent updates. </p>
<p>The finish line of how much this will cost will be in flux until I get the number of books I need to have published, and that idea should form pretty quickly. The initial estimate as I write this is going to be somewhere in the 1800 to 2300 dollar range. When a more concrete figure is known, we will be capping contributions if possible.</p>
<p>I cannot stress enough that there is no profit to be had in this. This is purely a labor of love, grief, and very possibly guilt.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<p>Reach out to people that Jonathan knew that may be interested in this project.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute or need to do so in a different way, email us at Jnthnbook@gmail.com so that we can count you towards the total needed to publish. </p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Hello my name is Dave Kang and I am a concept artist living in Toronto. This is the pre-sale campaign for my creation ‘Brush and Blood’. The artwork for this book was a labour of passion completed over the past three years. This campaign seeks to raise funds to pay for the printing of a first edition of 100 hardback full-color picture book.</p>

<h3>The Horror Art Book</h3>
<p>I have been a horror fan all my life and I’ve always wanted to create a terrifying horror world of my own. A simple sketch became a full creature, a page of ideas became dozens of bloody paintings...the moment I thought I was done with everything, a new idea had me opening my sketchbook again. After so many sketchbooks and bottles of wine, I've decided to make a new horror art book out of them. BRUSH AND BLOOD omits a few things  but it holds large amount of visions I had for the world of terror. With your love and support, it is my sincere belief that we can finish this book. I'm having so much fun working on it, and I hope that you will love the book as much as I do. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What's the reason for this campaign?</strong></p>
<p>For the past two years I've received a lot of messages from the folks who missed the book sale of <i>Year of the Ladybug</i>. Originally I was just going to print more copies and relaunch the campaign but it was just not as exciting to me. Instead I started working on a new book called Brush and Blood and it will be completed by coming December. Please do note that some of the contents come from <i>Year of the Ladybug </i>if you have a copy of the first book from 2018. </p>

</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>The nightmarish experience I had with the shipping of the first book back in 2018 taught me a big lesson. Instead of copying and pasting the address registered by the backers I must contact each backer individually to confirm the correct address IN ENGLISH.  It will be tedious but it is absolutely necessary in order to do this right. The sheer amount of returned items and reshipping cost made me hesitant to start a new book but my will to create is simply unstoppable. I'm going to treat each shipment as if I'm sending a gift to my aunt oversea. Other risks and challenges? I want myself and everyone to stay healthy and safe.</p>

<p>過去2年間、てんとう虫の年の本の販売を逃した人々からたくさんのメッセージを受け取りました。もともと私はもっと多くのコピーを印刷してキャンペーンを再開するつもりでしたが、それは私にとってそれほどエキサイティングではありませんでした。代わりに、Brush and Bloodという新しい本の作成を開始し、12月までに完成する予定です。 2018年の最初の本のコピーをお持ちの場合、一部のコンテンツはてんとう虫の年のものであることに注意してください。どうもありがとうございます:)</p>
<p>안녕하세요 강대웅입니다. 2018년에 판매하였던 이어오브더레이디버그 아트북에 대해서 문의하셨던 분들 생각하며 같은 책으로 다시 런칭하려고 했습니다. 하지만 그러기에는 뭔가…. 재미 없더라고요. 기왕 하는 거 더 좋은 책을 다시 만들자는 결심을 하게 되었고 지난 2년 동안의 새로운 작품들과 이어오브더레이디버그 그림들을 업그레이드시켜서 브러시엔 블러드를 런칭하게 되었습니다. 지금 진행되고 있는 게임 소식은 유튜브로 계속해서 전해 드리고 저는 그림쟁이로서 작품 활동에 집중하겠습니다. 늘 응원해 주시는 여러분들 진심으로 감사드립니다. 책 멋지게 만들어서 곱게 보내드리겠습니다. 스페셜 패키지에 그림을 드린다는 건 프린트가 아니고 오리지날 연필그림임을 알려드립니다!:)</p>

過去2年間、てんとう虫の年の本の販売を逃した人々からたくさんのメッセージを受け取りました。もともと私はもっと多くのコピーを印刷してキャンペーンを再開するつもりでしたが、それは私にとってそれほどエキサイティングではありませんでした。代わりに、Brush and Bloodという新しい本の作成を開始し、12月までに完成する予定です。 2018年の最初の本のコピーをお持ちの場合、一部のコンテンツはてんとう虫の年のものであることに注意してください。どうもありがとうございます:)
안녕하세요 강대웅입니다. 2018년에 판매하였던 이어오브더레이디버그 아트북에 대해서 문의하셨던 분들 생각하며 같은 책으로 다시 런칭하려고 했습니다. 하지만 그러기에는 뭔가…. 재미 없더라고요. 기왕 하는 거 더 좋은 책을 다시 만들자는 결심을 하게 되었고 지난 2년 동안의 새로운 작품들과 이어오브더레이디버그 그림들을 업그레이드시켜서 브러시엔 블러드를 런칭하게 되었습니다. 지금 진행되고 있는 게임 소식은 유튜브로 계속해서 전해 드리고 저는 그림쟁이로서 작품 활동에 집중하겠습니다. 늘 응원해 주시는 여러분들 진심으로 감사드립니다. 책 멋지게 만들어서 곱게 보내드리겠습니다. 스페셜 패키지에 그림을 드린다는 건 프린트가 아니고 오리지날 연필그림임을 알려드립니다!:)",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

Maines he remarked that “Nicole and Jonas’ courage, commitment, and
outspokenness made them perfect models for the kind of people—especially young
people—that I want to paint and present as models of courageous citizenship.” “The
opposite of courage is not cowardice—it is conformity,” said Robert, quoting
Texas writer Jim Hightower in closing. “One of the most important roles that
educators can play is to help young people become their true selves and not be
afraid to go wherever that might lead.”<br/>

I studied fine arts in Vienna and have been working on skin for 4 years now with the  goal of constantly creating something new. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>When I look back now I realize that tattooing was a logical step in my artistic career. Even during my studies, I remember feeling like I was tattooing paper, even before I started to work on skin.<span><br/></span><div>
<p><span><br/></span>I see myself more as an artist than a tattooist because I am constantly developing my visual voice and the only thing that changed since my studies has been the medium. <span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><span><br/></span></span></span></p>

<br/><p></p>
<b>ABOUT SYMMETRIES</b><br/>In my book Symmetries my goal is to display a series of drawings and etchings that give a significant insight into the artwork I was working on in Vienna. However, the main part of the book is dedicated to my tattoo art. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>We wanted to present the tattoos like in a gallery, drawing a connection between tattooing and fine art. As a result, the book’s minimalist design gives the reader space to experience my artwork in a way it has not been displayed before.
<p>Over the last six months my wonderful team and I have been collecting, screening and curating my artistic material from the past few years. Our plan was to document my development as a tattoo artist in an elaborately designed art book that expresses my passion for tattooing along with my large-scale images of my work, my picture language, which I was able to express in your tattoos.</p>
<p>Now we need your help, to bring SYMMETRIES to life. I am offering copies of the book, stickers, and even some super limited-edition prints in exchange for your support, and I will be adding more exclusive perks over the next few weeks. </p>
<p><i>Every donation, every pre-order of the book and even every share helps us to spread the word about the project and to cover the costs of printing.</i></p>

<b>ÜBER MICH</b><br/><p>Hi, mein Name ist Valentin Hirsch. Ich bin Künstler und arbeite in Berlin. Ich habe in Wien bildende Kunst studiert und arbeite seit den letzten vier Jahren auf dem Medium Haut mit dem Ziel ständig etwas neues zu entwickeln.</p>
<p>Wenn ich jetzt zurückblicke realisiere ich, dass das Tätowieren ein logischer Schritt in meiner künstlerischen Karriere war. Schon während meines Studiums hatte ich das Gefühl das Papier zu tätowieren und das lange bevor ich anfing auf Haut zu arbeiten.</p>
<p>Ich sehe mich selbst mehr als Künstler und nicht als Tätowierer, da ich ständig meine Bildsprache weiterentwickle und das schon seit meinem Studium. Das einzige was sich geändert hat, ist das Medium.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1111478/files/20141222043837-VH-SMMTRS-Close-Up.png?1419251917"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/><b>ÜBER SYMMETRIES<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Das Ziel in meinem Buch Symmetries ist es eine Serie von Zeichnungen und Radierungen zu zeigen, die einen signifikanten Einblick in die Arbeiten aus meiner Zeit in Wien, geben. Der Hauptteil des Buches widmet sich meinen Arbeiten auf Haut, den Tattoos.</span></p>
<p>Wir wollten die Tattoos wie in einer Ausstellung präsentieren und damit eine Verbindung zwischen dem Tätowieren und der bildenden Kunst herstellen. Das minimalistische Design gibt dem Betrachter Platz die Werke in einer Art und Weise zu erfahren, die so noch nicht gezeigt wurde.</p>
<p>Während der letzten 6 Monate haben mein wundervolles Team und ich das Material der letzten Jahre zusammengetragen, gesichtet und kuratiert. Herausgekommen ist ein aufwändig und mit viel Herzblut designtes Kunstbuch über meine Arbeit und meine Bildsprache, die ich in Euren Tätowierungen zum Ausdruck bringen durfte.</p>
<p>Nun brauchen wir Eure Hilfe, um SYMMETRIES zum Leben zu erwecken. Als Gegenzug für eure Unterstützung könnt ihr das Buch, Aufkleber und sogar einige limitierte Drucke erstehen. Über die kommenden Wochen werde ich noch einige exklusive Angebote veröffentlichen.</p>

ABOUT:ABOUT MEHello, my name is Valentin Hirsch, an artist based in Berlin. I studied fine arts in Vienna and have been working on skin for 4 years now with the  goal of constantly creating something new. When I look back now I realize that tattooing was a logical step in my artistic career. Even during my studies, I remember feeling like I was tattooing paper, even before I started to work on skin.
I see myself more as an artist than a tattooist because I am constantly developing my visual voice and the only thing that changed since my studies has been the medium. 



ABOUT SYMMETRIESIn my book Symmetries my goal is to display a series of drawings and etchings that give a significant insight into the artwork I was working on in Vienna. However, the main part of the book is dedicated to my tattoo art. We wanted to present the tattoos like in a gallery, drawing a connection between tattooing and fine art. As a result, the book’s minimalist design gives the reader space to experience my artwork in a way it has not been displayed before.
Over the last six months my wonderful team and I have been collecting, screening and curating my artistic material from the past few years. Our plan was to document my development as a tattoo artist in an elaborately designed art book that expresses my passion for tattooing along with my large-scale images of my work, my picture language, which I was able to express in your tattoos.
Now we need your help, to bring SYMMETRIES to life. I am offering copies of the book, stickers, and even some super limited-edition prints in exchange for your support, and I will be adding more exclusive perks over the next few weeks. 
Every donation, every pre-order of the book and even every share helps us to spread the word about the project and to cover the costs of printing.

Hilf mit Valentin Hirsch’s erstes Buch Symmetries zum Leben zu erwecken!



AKTUELLE ARBEITEN:

Hier ein paar meiner aktuellen Arbeiten, um euch einen Einblick zu geben was ich zurzeit tue.




Für mehr akutelle Arbeiten besuche meine WEBSITE oder mein INSTAGRAM Profil.



ÜBER:

ÜBER MICHHi, mein Name ist Valentin Hirsch. Ich bin Künstler und arbeite in Berlin. Ich habe in Wien bildende Kunst studiert und arbeite seit den letzten vier Jahren auf dem Medium Haut mit dem Ziel ständig etwas neues zu entwickeln.
Wenn ich jetzt zurückblicke realisiere ich, dass das Tätowieren ein logischer Schritt in meiner künstlerischen Karriere war. Schon während meines Studiums hatte ich das Gefühl das Papier zu tätowieren und das lange bevor ich anfing auf Haut zu arbeiten.
Ich sehe mich selbst mehr als Künstler und nicht als Tätowierer, da ich ständig meine Bildsprache weiterentwickle und das schon seit meinem Studium. Das einzige was sich geändert hat, ist das Medium. 



ÜBER SYMMETRIESDas Ziel in meinem Buch Symmetries ist es eine Serie von Zeichnungen und Radierungen zu zeigen, die einen signifikanten Einblick in die Arbeiten aus meiner Zeit in Wien, geben. Der Hauptteil des Buches widmet sich meinen Arbeiten auf Haut, den Tattoos.
Wir wollten die Tattoos wie in einer Ausstellung präsentieren und damit eine Verbindung zwischen dem Tätowieren und der bildenden Kunst herstellen. Das minimalistische Design gibt dem Betrachter Platz die Werke in einer Art und Weise zu erfahren, die so noch nicht gezeigt wurde.
Während der letzten 6 Monate haben mein wundervolles Team und ich das Material der letzten Jahre zusammengetragen, gesichtet und kuratiert. Herausgekommen ist ein aufwändig und mit viel Herzblut designtes Kunstbuch über meine Arbeit und meine Bildsprache, die ich in Euren Tätowierungen zum Ausdruck bringen durfte.
Nun brauchen wir Eure Hilfe, um SYMMETRIES zum Leben zu erwecken. Als Gegenzug für eure Unterstützung könnt ihr das Buch, Aufkleber und sogar einige limitierte Drucke erstehen. Über die kommenden Wochen werde ich noch einige exklusive Angebote veröffentlichen.
Jede Spende, jede Vorbestellung und jeder einzelne Share hilft uns, das Projekt bekannt zu machen und die Druckkosten zu decken.

</div><p>HEELLOOO my name is Renaud and I like to draw
penises. It still makes me giggle like a four year old… every time. But I’m a
grown man now and I gotta get serious. If I want to draw another penis, I have
to go the extra mile. 8000 miles to be exact. Yeah, I want to draw, by GPS, the
largest penis in the history of mankind. But why do it alone? Something this
groundbreaking deserves to be a shared experience. This is why I am starting
this campaign, to get other people involved. Can you imagine how cool it would
be if the world got together to draw a giant d*ck? This might even be Guinness
World Record Big. The previous record for a GPS drawing was a marriage proposal
from japan, and it wasn’t even half the size (it was at least half the size, but still much much smaller). Not to mention the hilarity of
crushing such a romantic gesture with a c*ck.</p>
<p>I will be doing this with my girlfriend, Arielle and our nameless friend who owns a car… and I invite you to join me. The trip will start on July
24<sup>th</sup> until august 24<sup>th</sup>. We Start in Ottawa and rush our
way to Vegas, then we have about 3 weeks to drive through Los Angeles, up the
West coast to Vancouver. Then we rush back home. During this trip, I will keep
you guys updated through vlogs and twitter. If I pass through your city, let me
know and we can grab drinks! The full map will be made available.</p>
<p>I have an approximate budget for the trip of 3000$. That’s
based on 1200 for gas and 50$ a day for food and shelter. The rest will cover
the fees for Indiegogo as well as the cost for the perks. This is a flexible
campaign, so even if we don’t make it to 3 grand, I am still doing this. If by
miracle we get too much money, I will give whatever profit we make to a charity
for prostate cancer. </p>

Quem aprecia meu trabalho (e/ou a minha pessoa) e gostaria de contribuir com a quantia que seja possível, eu estarei para sempre agradecida! A taxa de inscrição compreende estadia e comida, mas custa 570 euros (hoje a R$2494,25!!!), e o bilhete 136 euros, o que é muito caro para o meu orçamento...        Qualquer ajuda é ótimo, pois minimizará o impacto que é desembolsar toda essa grana, mas que afinal, é um grande investimento na minha carreira e uma oportunidade incrível. Muito obrigada desde já por toda e qualquer ajuda que possam oferecer <3LEMBRETE IMPORTANTE: A vaquinha está em DÓLARES!

<p><strong>My Story</strong></p>
<strong>
<p>I'm an artist like many others: I spent six years of my life achieving my dream of going to art school and getting my MFA, then post graduation the real world crept in and a full time job took over my life, leaving me with less and less time to dedicate to my art. Over the last two years I've been able to renew my focus, and this year I'm cranking it up to the next level with a personal challenge to paint one 4”x4” painting every day starting on April 6<sup>th</sup> and continuing for the next year. 365 paintings in 365 days.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1337130/files/20150329173728-image.jpg?1427675848"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>What I need more than anything else is supporters and cheerleaders to keep me on-track and motivated throughout the year. I started this challenge to keep developing as an artist, and I brought it to Indiegogo to bring as many people into my world as I can. I know myself well enough to understand that I can’t and won’t do this alone. I'll have a day sometime within this next year where I won’t be up to creating, and if left on my own I won’t do it. One day will lead to two, two days will become a week, and before I know it the challenge will not be met. Knowing that I have all of you behind me and following the project will be my daily reminder that I have to keep going and not give in to the temptation to lay it aside.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1333036/files/20150328042038-image.jpg?1427541638"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>What We Get:</p>
<p>The money that I raise will be used to buy supplies for my project (wood, paint, brushes, etc) and send my daily paintings to their new homes.</p>
<p>Again, it's more important to me is to get as many people as possible to follow the project throughout the year at <a href=""http://artidt.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>artidt.tumblr.com</u></a> and force me to achieve my goal!</p>
<p>If you are interested in making a monetary donation, I highly recommend the $45 option as you'll get to own a piece of the project. The perk at this level is to be a proud owner of one of the 365 paintings I will be creating for the challenge. Your date will be randomly assigned and I will take requests for specific dates on a first come first served basis. I will endeavor to get your painting mailed to you within a week of it’s creation <strong>UNLESS</strong> I reach my stretch goal of raising $5,000.</p>

<br/>
<p>Stretch Goal:</p>
<p>If my stretch goal is reached, I'll be holding off on mailing all the paintings until 2016. This is because my stretch goal is to use the $5,000 to rent a gallery space and host a show and reception to display all 365 days worth of work.</p>
<p><strong>I'm also going to be donating 5% of ANY amount that is raised to the Multicultural Magnet School in New London, CT, to help keep their amazing art program going strong.</strong></p>

<p>My name is Jon and I’m hoping to help some of the
city’s greatest artists raise funds to get their art out there and find a new
audience somewhere on the globe. Appropriately, I’m starting with one of my
oldest friends and favourite artists, Sepr. If you don’t know him, take a look

been invited to exhibit in Melbourne in April as part of a <a href=""http://www.britishcouncil.org/study-work-create/opportunity/funding-creativity/artists-international-development-fund"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.britishcouncil.org/study-work-create/opportunity/funding-creativity/artists-international-development-fund"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>British Council initiative</span></a>. This
is a partnership with the Arts Council for freelance and self employed artist
based in the UK to get out and reach global audiences, <a href=""http://www.britishcouncil.org/study-work-create/opportunity/funding-creativity/artists-international-development-fund"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'The Artist's International Development Fund'</a>.  <span></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">While we have a
good chance of receiving this fund, he was only able to apply for 33% of
funding and needed to raise the other 66% himself. We only have until the 6th
of March to raise the match funding, so seeing as he’s such a popular lad, I
thought I’d put in a little leg work and see if between you Melburnians and us
Bristolians and a little help from the rest of the world we could get him to
exhibit to what I believe will be a hugely receptive audience.</span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1213628/files/20150211020219-never_breathe.jpg?1423648939"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>

DIY art stretches back to his days as the drummer of Five Knuckle in the early
2000s. This method of staunchly independent artistry means he is one of
Bristol’s most active and prolific artists, with distinct graphic style and
every image layered with ideas and wit. Sadly, as with a lot of great artists
and hard workers, this does not necessarily equate into the most lucrative of
professions. <p></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

</div></div>","Getting our Bristol artists out into the
world (and hopefully bringing a few back with them).
My name is Jon and I’m hoping to help some of the
city’s greatest artists raise funds to get their art out there and find a new
audience somewhere on the globe. Appropriately, I’m starting with one of my
oldest friends and favourite artists, Sepr. If you don’t know him, take a look
at his work here .
 (To take a quick peek at the ltd print perks available, click here)
Sepr’s
been invited to exhibit in Melbourne in April as part of a British Council initiative. This
is a partnership with the Arts Council for freelance and self employed artist
based in the UK to get out and reach global audiences, 'The Artist's International Development Fund'.  While we have a
good chance of receiving this fund, he was only able to apply for 33% of
funding and needed to raise the other 66% himself. We only have until the 6th
of March to raise the match funding, so seeing as he’s such a popular lad, I
thought I’d put in a little leg work and see if between you Melburnians and us
Bristolians and a little help from the rest of the world we could get him to
exhibit to what I believe will be a hugely receptive audience.

In contributing to
this campaign, you will get something amazing in return – be it an original
sketch and Thank You from Sepr, a limited edition print or the chance to
commission your very own large-scale work.
(Brand New 'Putting the Band Back Together' Ltd Ed 3 Colour Print Perk -->)Sepr’s approach to
DIY art stretches back to his days as the drummer of Five Knuckle in the early
2000s. This method of staunchly independent artistry means he is one of
Bristol’s most active and prolific artists, with distinct graphic style and
every image layered with ideas and wit. Sadly, as with a lot of great artists
and hard workers, this does not necessarily equate into the most lucrative of
professions. 



(Melvins Handscreen Printed Print 2012, Signed by the Band and Artist ---->)


For the trip – with visas, the studio costs, the exhibition spaces, travel, materials, Easter flights, the fees for using this crowd funding resource and wall-to-wall painting and exhibiting in and
around Melbourne – we need to raise £2400 to get him over for April. These cost do not include any accommodation or personal costs for the journeys and are all strictly professional costs for the trip.

Every donation is
incredibly appreciated and I believe there is something hugely exciting about
people collectively supporting their artist friends. It’s also great to give the
people of Melbourne the chance to become actively involved in bringing over an
artist they want to paint their walls.
This is why we have created a couple of tiers of ‘Perks’. Instead of simply asking for a handout, we want to get Sepr working when he gets to Melbourne and hit the ground running, painting, meeting people, getting involved.

</h3> <p>ACCASARTI è uno spazio per residenze d'artista, fondato dalla cooperazione di singole persone e delle associazioni culturali TRW e S'Umbra con una lunga esperienza nella realizzazione di progetti di arte contemporanea. Abbiamo affittato una 
piccola casa al piano terra di un antico edificio nel centro storico di 
Cagliari. <br/>Su una collina che domina la città, ACCASARTI sta in uno 
dei vicoli stretti e tortuosi, tra numerosi piccoli centri d'arte e 
culture. <b>ACCASARTI è un piccolo affascinante open space </b>con archi
 in pietra e soppalco in legno, accanto c'è la scuola-laboratorio di 
fotografia di S 'Umbra, a pochi metri si trovano i laboratori del fabbro e 
del falegname, ed a pochi passi ci sono gallerie, musei, studi di arte e
 artigianato. Inoltre, un quartiere intero si muove intorno gli artisti 
in residenza, pronto a sostenerli calorosamente. Per tutti questi motivi
 ACCASARTI vuole invitare artisti internazionali a realizzare qui i loro
 progetti.</p>

L'artista lavorerà sul territorio di Cagliari
 per realizzare una delle sue performance simboliche, potenti e 
coinvolgenti. <br/>Il suo lavoro ""<b>fende lo sguardo dello spettatore 
per introdurlo in un vortice di verità che fa i conti con la storia e 
con le problematiche attuali per evidenziare i collassi di un regime di 
potenza – di una società disciplinare (Foucault) – emersa dalla fine 
della politica e dalla fine dell’etica culturale.</b>"" </p>
<p><br/>Mary Zygouri è 
un grande artista performer. I suoi progetti hanno

</h3>
<p>Mary è appena rientrata dal <b>festival Aeschylian 2014 </b>ad  Elefsina, l'antica Eleusi, dove ha realizzato una performance in collaborazione con <b>Michelangelo Pistoletto </b>per i riti Eleusini. Una azione concepita come una processione laica, nella quale il pubblico presente, come in  pellegrinaggio, l'ha accompagnata lungo il percorso. <br/><br/>Subito dopo la fine della performance l'artista si è rivolta al pubblico con queste parole: ""Sento questa città dentro la mia pelle ... il tunnel in cui sono entrata, i serbatoi della TITAN*, il cemento dentro cui ho camminato... sento il mio corpo sofferente ma mi sento felice per i momenti che abbiamo vissuto attraversando questa città. E' come se fossi stata nel mio sogno, nella mia utopia; questa folla che ha riempito la città con le sue tracce, è stato un invito a camminare verso l’utopia... "" <i>* la TITAN è una industria del cemento di Elefsina, causa di inquinamento.</i></p>

 ACCASARTI è uno spazio per residenze d'artista, fondato dalla cooperazione di singole persone e delle associazioni culturali TRW e S'Umbra con una lunga esperienza nella realizzazione di progetti di arte contemporanea. Abbiamo affittato una 
piccola casa al piano terra di un antico edificio nel centro storico di 
Cagliari. Su una collina che domina la città, ACCASARTI sta in uno 
dei vicoli stretti e tortuosi, tra numerosi piccoli centri d'arte e 
culture. ACCASARTI è un piccolo affascinante open space con archi
 in pietra e soppalco in legno, accanto c'è la scuola-laboratorio di 
fotografia di S 'Umbra, a pochi metri si trovano i laboratori del fabbro e 
del falegname, ed a pochi passi ci sono gallerie, musei, studi di arte e
 artigianato. Inoltre, un quartiere intero si muove intorno gli artisti 
in residenza, pronto a sostenerli calorosamente. Per tutti questi motivi
 ACCASARTI vuole invitare artisti internazionali a realizzare qui i loro
 progetti.

ACCASARTI ART RESIDENCIES

 LA RESIDENZA DI MARY ZYGOURI

 
Dall'11 ottobre all'11 novembre ACCASARTI ospita la residenza 
dell'artista greca Mary Zygouri, curata e voluta da Sustainable Happiness nell'ambito delle residenze artistiche del festival Alig'Art-futuro anteriore , e in collaborazione con TRW.  L'artista lavorerà sul territorio di Cagliari
 per realizzare una delle sue performance simboliche, potenti e 
coinvolgenti. Il suo lavoro ""fende lo sguardo dello spettatore 
per introdurlo in un vortice di verità che fa i conti con la storia e 
con le problematiche attuali per evidenziare i collassi di un regime di 
potenza – di una società disciplinare (Foucault) – emersa dalla fine 
della politica e dalla fine dell’etica culturale."" 
Mary Zygouri è 
un grande artista performer. I suoi progetti hanno 
un forte impatto sulla comunità in cui vengono realizzati e grande 
visibilità nel mondo dell'arte contemporanea. TRW ha bisogno di coprire i costi della residenza. Chiediamo il sostegno per pagare le spese di affitto, il 
cachet dell'artista e il personale coinvolto nel 
progetto: un falegname, un segretario, un graphic designer, un 
fotografo, un operatore video e un operatore audio. In più vorremmo poter rimborsare le spese 
quotidiane dell'artista. 
Aiutaci a sostenere le spese di produzione.
Diventa co-produttore di un grande progetto di arte.
Ad ACCASARTI accadranno delle cose meravigliose anche grazie al tuo contributo. 



 

MARY ZYGOURI ART RESIDENCE

From 11 October to 11 November ACCASARTI hosts the residence project of the Greek artist Mary Zygouri, which will work in the territory of Cagliari to achieve one of its symbolic , powerful and engaging performances. His work ""cleaves the viewer's gaze to introduce it into a vortex of truth who comes to terms with the history and current issues to highlight the collapse of a regime of power - of a disciplinary society (Foucault) - emerged after the end of the political and the end of cultural ethics. ""
Mary Zygouri is a great performer artist, which worked with international artists like Marina Abramovic and Michelangelo Pistoletto. Her projects have a strong impact in the community where are realized and great visibility in the world of contemporary art. 
TRW  needs to covered the residence expenses. We ask for support to pay the rental costs , the cachet for the artist and for the staff involved in the project: a carpenter, a secretary, a graphic designer, a photographer, a video operator and an audio operator . We also want to cover the daily expenses of the artist. Help us to bear the costs of production.You have the opportunity to become a co-producer of a very great art project.In ACCASARTI wonderful things can happens thanks to your contribution.Mary Zygouri on web:blogspot.itvimeo.comFacebook.comPRODURRE UNA GRANDE OPERA D'ARTE

Mary è appena rientrata dal festival Aeschylian 2014 ad  Elefsina, l'antica Eleusi, dove ha realizzato una performance in collaborazione con Michelangelo Pistoletto per i riti Eleusini. Una azione concepita come una processione laica, nella quale il pubblico presente, come in  pellegrinaggio, l'ha accompagnata lungo il percorso. Subito dopo la fine della performance l'artista si è rivolta al pubblico con queste parole: ""Sento questa città dentro la mia pelle ... il tunnel in cui sono entrata, i serbatoi della TITAN*, il cemento dentro cui ho camminato... sento il mio corpo sofferente ma mi sento felice per i momenti che abbiamo vissuto attraversando questa città. E' come se fossi stata nel mio sogno, nella mia utopia; questa folla che ha riempito la città con le sue tracce, è stato un invito a camminare verso l’utopia... "" * la TITAN è una industria del cemento di Elefsina, causa di inquinamento.
in un'intervista Mary dichiara :
""Un grande capitolo della storia greca moderna è stato scritto in questa zona, qui gli elementi del paesaggio sono tanti, lotte sindacali, incidenti, inquinamento…la possibilità di dialogo tra il mito e il paesaggio è per me una grande sfida...Il ruolo dell'artista è quello di suggerire una nuova prospettiva della realtà, con un suggestivo, poetico e forse profondamente politico modo di aprire nuove prospettive, creare nuove immagini""
Il territorio di Cagliari e della Sardegna è la prossima sfida della ricerca di Mary Zygouri, che affronterà tutte le contraddizioni e le difficoltà di questo territorio.
TRW seguirà l'artista lungo tutto il processo creativo e realizzerà un documentario sulla residenza artistica.Il documentario vuole rivelare un aspetto inedito del lavoro di Zygouri, da cui far emergere le procedure e le metodologie del suo lavoro oltre che le sue motivazioni teoriche e concettuali. Produrremo un cofanetto contenente un set di cartoline della residenza e un DVD con il documentario e la realizzazione video della performance finale, realizzato dall'artista.

The territory of Cagliari and Sardinia is the next challenge for the research of Mary Zygouri, which will address all the contradictions and difficulties of this territory in the resulting performance.TRW will follow the artist throughout all the creative process and will make a documentary about the artist residency. The documentary aims to reveal a inedited aspect of the work of Zygouri, which bring out the procedures and methods of her work as well as its theoretical and conceptual reasons. We will produce a special box containing a set of postcard of the residence and the DVD with the documentary and the video release of the performance, edited by the artist

<p>We would also like to make an impact with art students throughout the city, and plan to display our truck at local high schools.

</div></div>","Welcome, friends! And thank you for joining Art Mobile as we begin our mission to inspire creativity in The City Beautiful: Orlando Florida, and feature artists in a new and unique way. 


Imagine going for a walk at your favorite park, or heading to your usual haunt, only to come across live music, appetizing aromas, and an eclectic display of art.That's us!From a distance, we may seem like a simple moving truck, but as you approach, you'll discover so much more. 
Inside you’ll find thought-provoking artwork created by talented artists from your own community. You’ll have the opportunity to peruse our carefully curated shows and get to know the great artists behind the work. The next day we’ll be gone – on to deliver a memorable experience in the next area of town.
For each show, we plan to have an opening night, premiering work from great new artists in the Orlando community. We’ll be working with food trucks, musicians, DJs and performers to create a one-of-a-kind evening to remember that’s free and open to the public. After our opening, the show will continue on to many other locations throughout the month, to areas like Altamonte Springs, Maitland, Winter Garden and Sanford.
We would also like to make an impact with art students throughout the city, and plan to display our truck at local high schools. We want to show students that a career in the arts is rewarding, lucrative and vital to helping Orlando become an even more dynamic and cultured city. In conjunction with our sponsor at The Art XChange, we also plan to host art supply drives for elementary and middle school art programs.

Among the Art Mobile ranks you’ll find an art buyer, event coordinator, legal assistant, gallery curator, and photographer. We came together around this wonderful concept and have already poured countless hours into bringing Art Mobile to life. We can’t wait to see it become a reality!

As you can see, we have big plans for Art Mobile and Orlando, but first we need to raise funds to get Art Mobile up and running. Art Mobile events will always be free and open to the public, so please consider making a donation right now, so that we can bring this project to fruition. We need capital to pay for:-The truck-Gas-Materials-Permits-Misc. legal feesYour support will help our big idea become an amazing reality.But your donation won’t just assist us.

</p><p><b>16. Letný filmový seminár 4 živly</b> s témou MOC sa bude konať v Banskej Štiavnici v dňoch <b>6. - 10. augusta 2014</b>
a naším cieľom je aj tento rok vytvoriť v jeho programe priestor
pre rodiny, v rámci ktorého sa deti (8 – 12 rokov) budú
zoznamovať hravou, aktívnou a tvorivou formou s filmom a
audiovizuálnym umením. Chceli by sme prispieť k formovaniu
poučeného a vnímavého filmového diváka, potenciálneho tvorcu,
ktorý sa orientuje vo svete médií a nie je len nekritickým
konzumentom priemernej televíznej zábavy. <b>Detské 4 živly</b>
sa budú konať od piatka <b>8. augusta</b> do nedele <b>10. augusta
2014</b> a svojim účastníkom a účastníčkam ponúknu
hudobný a animačný a workshop (oba kapacitne obmedzené, s
účasťou viazanou na účastnícky poplatok a prihlásenie začiatkom júla), otvorené výtvarné
dielne, ale aj premietania kvalitných filmov pre detské publikum.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/637109/files/20140609163328-DetskeZ2.jpg?1402356808"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p><u><b>Hudobný workshop </b></u>
</p>
<p>Na hudobnom workshope skupina
detí (8 – 12 rokov) vymyslí a nacvičí skladbu ku krátkemu
filmu. Nie je nevyhnutné, aby deti vedeli hrať na nejaký
hudobný nástroj, súčasťou „ozvučenia“ filmu môžu
byť aj rôzne ruchy, zvuky atď. Dôležité je, aby deti mali
záujem o film a hudbu, aby boli motivované tvoriť a hrať sa.
Tvoriť budú pod vedením profesionálnych a skúsených
lektorov Antona Gútha a Pauly Pelić. Výslednú skladbu budú
deti prezentovať naživo spolu s premietaním krátkeho filmu,
ku ktorému skladba vznikla – samozrejme tiež za prítomnosti
publika. Takže pôjde o akýsi koncert – premietanie so živou
hudbou, ktorého záznam bude neskôr spracovaný a prezentovaný
online. Tri miesta na hudobnom workshope sme v rámci osvedčenej
spolupráce vyhradili banskoštiavnickým deťom zo sociálne slabších rodín.
Viac informácií o lektoroch hudobného workshopu a ich
aktivitách nájdete na <u><a href=""http://www.rytmika.sk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.rytmika.sk</a></u>.  Možnosť prihlasovať sa na workshop otvoríme v prvý júlový týždeň, po skončení kampane, keď bude jasné, aké sú naše finančné možnosti. </p>
<p>
</p><p><u><b>Animačný workshop </b></u>
</p>
<p>Lektorkami tohtoročného animačného
workshopu, určeného pre deti od 8 do 12 rokov, budú vizuálne
umelkyne a absolventky VŠVU Andrea Lenártová a Barbara Fehérová,
dohromady známe ako Tri švestky. Spolu so skupinou detí vytvoria
príbeh, ktorý rozdelia na jednotlivé epizódy – tie budú
vytvárať a animovať deti v dvojiciach. Súčasťou práce bude
vytvorenie postavičiek, prostredí, dekorácií a samostatná
animácia pod vedením lektoriek a lektora (ktorý bude pomáhať so
stop-motion animáciou). Pri výslednej animácii sa bude používať
tzv. „tagtool“, čo je vizuálny inštrument, ktorý sa používa
na javisku alebo vo verejných priestranstvách ulíc a budov.
Animovaný film bude mať verejnú premiéru za účasti detí, rodičov a verejnosti a každé z detí dostane na
pamiatku DVD s vytvoreným filmom. Film zavesíme na youtube, vimeo,
facebook profil 4 živlov. Viac informácií o lektorkách workshopu
nájdete na <u><a href=""http://trisvestky.weebly.com/my.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">trisvestky.weebly.com/my.html</a>.</u> Aj v prípade animačného workshopu platí, že prihlášky bude možné podávať začiatkom júla a kapacity budú limitované. </p>
<p>
</p><p><u><b>Výtvarné dielne </b></u>
</p>
<p>V priestoroch tvorivých dielní Terra
Permonia pripravia výtvarníci Pavol Ďurák a Lucia Ďuráková
Hronská výtvarné animačné dielne, na ktorých sa deti oboznámia
s úplnými základmi filmovej animácie a samé si ju odskúšajú
na sebou vytvorenej postavičke z papiera. Na rozdiel od workshopov
pre vopred nahlásených účastníkov a
účastníčky, výtvarné dielne sú voľne prístupné všetkým záujemcom a záujemkyniam. </p>
<p>
</p><p><u><b>Premietania filmov</b></u></p>
<p>Výber
filmov je ovplyvnený témou Letného filmového seminára 4 živly –
MOC – a zároveň snahou organizátorov sprístupniť deťom
aj staršie klasické filmy, ktoré ovplyvnili generáciu ich
rodičov. Plánovaná je napríklad projekcia filmu o Pipi Dlhej Pančuche a jej špeciálnych schopnostiach, alebo Vynález skazy, dielo režiséra Karla Zemana, na motívy Julesa Vernea. Filmy budeme premietať nielen tradične v leháre
čajovne Klopačka, ale aj v premietacej sále tvorivého centra
Terra Permonia, kde sa môžete tešiť aj na projekciu zo 16mm
filmového pásu.

<p>
</p><p><b>Čo
potrebujeme</b></p>
<p>1500
€ je suma, ktorú potrebujeme na pokrytie nevyhnutných nákladov
súvisiacich s technickým a personálnym zabezpečením oboch
workshopov, výtvarných dielní a na zabezpečenie premietacích
práv na filmy z programu Detských 4 živlov, ktoré tvoria
podstatnú časť rozpočtu podujatia.

jednotlivým výškam príspevkov. Kliknutím na vybranú odmenu sa
nielen dostanete do systému, v ktorom môžete prispieť na
organizáciu Detských 4 živlov, ale zabezpečíte si aj niektorú z
pozorností alebo výhod prináležiacich k nej. V prípade úspechu
kampane Vám Vašu odmenu doručíme krátko po jej skončení,
prípadne odovzdáme priamo na Letnom filmovom seminári 4 živly v
auguste, ak s ním odmena priamo súvisí (napríklad účasť na
workshope alebo akreditácia na seminár). </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Risk
</b>
</p>
<p>1500 €, ktoré by sme chceli vyzbierať, predstavuje reálnu sumu pokrývajúcu náklady spojené s organizáciou oboch workshopov, výtvarných dielní a záverečnej prezentácie, ale aj náklady potrebné na zisk filmových práv a kópií. V prípade, že sumu nevyzbierame, budeme musieť plánovaný program výrazne okresať. Ak však sumu získame, urobíme všetko,
čo bude v našich silách, aby sme pre deti v Banskej Štiavnici
pripravili nezabudnuteľný predĺžený víkend!  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/637110/files/20140609163506-DetskeZ3.jpg?1402356906"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p></div>","UPOZORNENIE - platiť môžete, aj ak nemáte zažený PayPal účet. Stránka vás síce presmeruje do systému PayPalu, ako po anglicky upozorňuje, tam si však môžete vybrať aj možnosť platiť kreditnou alebo debetnou kartou. V PRÍPADE AKÝCHKOĽVEK KOMPLIKÁCIÍ, VRÁTANE JAZYKOVÝCH, NEVÁHAJTE SA NA NÁS OBRÁTIŤ A NAPÍSAŤ NA peter@slovakfilm.sk! Čo sú Detské 4 živly?

ktorý sa orientuje vo svete médií a nie je len nekritickým
konzumentom priemernej televíznej zábavy. Detské 4 živly
sa budú konať od piatka 8. augusta do nedele 10. augusta
2014 a svojim účastníkom a účastníčkam ponúknu
hudobný a animačný a workshop (oba kapacitne obmedzené, s
účasťou viazanou na účastnícky poplatok a prihlásenie začiatkom júla), otvorené výtvarné
dielne, ale aj premietania kvalitných filmov pre detské publikum.

Hudobný workshop 

Na hudobnom workshope skupina
detí (8 – 12 rokov) vymyslí a nacvičí skladbu ku krátkemu
filmu. Nie je nevyhnutné, aby deti vedeli hrať na nejaký
hudobný nástroj, súčasťou „ozvučenia“ filmu môžu
byť aj rôzne ruchy, zvuky atď. Dôležité je, aby deti mali
záujem o film a hudbu, aby boli motivované tvoriť a hrať sa.
Tvoriť budú pod vedením profesionálnych a skúsených
lektorov Antona Gútha a Pauly Pelić. Výslednú skladbu budú
deti prezentovať naživo spolu s premietaním krátkeho filmu,
ku ktorému skladba vznikla – samozrejme tiež za prítomnosti
publika. Takže pôjde o akýsi koncert – premietanie so živou
hudbou, ktorého záznam bude neskôr spracovaný a prezentovaný
online. Tri miesta na hudobnom workshope sme v rámci osvedčenej
spolupráce vyhradili banskoštiavnickým deťom zo sociálne slabších rodín.
Viac informácií o lektoroch hudobného workshopu a ich
aktivitách nájdete na www.rytmika.sk.  Možnosť prihlasovať sa na workshop otvoríme v prvý júlový týždeň, po skončení kampane, keď bude jasné, aké sú naše finančné možnosti. 

Animačný workshop 

Lektorkami tohtoročného animačného
workshopu, určeného pre deti od 8 do 12 rokov, budú vizuálne
umelkyne a absolventky VŠVU Andrea Lenártová a Barbara Fehérová,
dohromady známe ako Tri švestky. Spolu so skupinou detí vytvoria
príbeh, ktorý rozdelia na jednotlivé epizódy – tie budú
vytvárať a animovať deti v dvojiciach. Súčasťou práce bude
vytvorenie postavičiek, prostredí, dekorácií a samostatná
animácia pod vedením lektoriek a lektora (ktorý bude pomáhať so
stop-motion animáciou). Pri výslednej animácii sa bude používať
tzv. „tagtool“, čo je vizuálny inštrument, ktorý sa používa
na javisku alebo vo verejných priestranstvách ulíc a budov.
Animovaný film bude mať verejnú premiéru za účasti detí, rodičov a verejnosti a každé z detí dostane na
pamiatku DVD s vytvoreným filmom. Film zavesíme na youtube, vimeo,
facebook profil 4 živlov. Viac informácií o lektorkách workshopu
nájdete na trisvestky.weebly.com/my.html. Aj v prípade animačného workshopu platí, že prihlášky bude možné podávať začiatkom júla a kapacity budú limitované. 

Výtvarné dielne 

V priestoroch tvorivých dielní Terra
Permonia pripravia výtvarníci Pavol Ďurák a Lucia Ďuráková
Hronská výtvarné animačné dielne, na ktorých sa deti oboznámia
s úplnými základmi filmovej animácie a samé si ju odskúšajú
na sebou vytvorenej postavičke z papiera. Na rozdiel od workshopov
pre vopred nahlásených účastníkov a
účastníčky, výtvarné dielne sú voľne prístupné všetkým záujemcom a záujemkyniam. 

Premietania filmov
Výber
filmov je ovplyvnený témou Letného filmového seminára 4 živly –
MOC – a zároveň snahou organizátorov sprístupniť deťom
aj staršie klasické filmy, ktoré ovplyvnili generáciu ich
rodičov. Plánovaná je napríklad projekcia filmu o Pipi Dlhej Pančuche a jej špeciálnych schopnostiach, alebo Vynález skazy, dielo režiséra Karla Zemana, na motívy Julesa Vernea. Filmy budeme premietať nielen tradične v leháre
čajovne Klopačka, ale aj v premietacej sále tvorivého centra
Terra Permonia, kde sa môžete tešiť aj na projekciu zo 16mm
filmového pásu.



Čo
potrebujeme
1500
€ je suma, ktorú potrebujeme na pokrytie nevyhnutných nákladov
súvisiacich s technickým a personálnym zabezpečením oboch
workshopov, výtvarných dielní a na zabezpečenie premietacích
práv na filmy z programu Detských 4 živlov, ktoré tvoria
podstatnú časť rozpočtu podujatia.  


Čo
môžete získať
V
stĺpci napravo nájdete zoznam odmien, ktoré prináležia k
jednotlivým výškam príspevkov. Kliknutím na vybranú odmenu sa
nielen dostanete do systému, v ktorom môžete prispieť na
organizáciu Detských 4 živlov, ale zabezpečíte si aj niektorú z
pozorností alebo výhod prináležiacich k nej. V prípade úspechu
kampane Vám Vašu odmenu doručíme krátko po jej skončení,
prípadne odovzdáme priamo na Letnom filmovom seminári 4 živly v
auguste, ak s ním odmena priamo súvisí (napríklad účasť na
workshope alebo akreditácia na seminár). 

Risk


1500 €, ktoré by sme chceli vyzbierať, predstavuje reálnu sumu pokrývajúcu náklady spojené s organizáciou oboch workshopov, výtvarných dielní a záverečnej prezentácie, ale aj náklady potrebné na zisk filmových práv a kópií. V prípade, že sumu nevyzbierame, budeme musieť plánovaný program výrazne okresať. Ak však sumu získame, urobíme všetko,
čo bude v našich silách, aby sme pre deti v Banskej Štiavnici
pripravili nezabudnuteľný predĺžený víkend!",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>FOMOphobia is a network-connected sculpture that monitors the state of the artist’s social networks, keeps count, and sounds alarms when there is unread content, possibly provoking one to reconsider the value of one’s relentless connectedness.</p>
<p>Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) is a form of social anxiety described as “a compulsive concern that one might miss an opportunity for social interaction, a novel experience, or other satisfying event.” FOMO is the result of our bombardment by modern networking, more insidious because we take an active part in it, simultaneously stressed out about and perpetuating our own addiction.  </p>
<p>FOMOphobia brings this private guilt to the surface with glaring numeric displays and alarm bells. It exposes the artist’s social networking burden and addiction, revealing both the accumulation and content of his social media messages. FOMOphobia challenges viewers to re-weigh the cost of their participation in social media.</p>

<h3>Lee &amp; Yolande Clark</h3>
<p>We are Lee Horus Clark &amp; Yolande Clark.  We are wood-firing ceramic artists, and we have dedicated our lives to art, to clay, to fire, and to our family for many years. We have worked extremely hard to create a home for our children, and a kiln on our own land. </p>
<p>We have 3 beautiful children:  Horus, 4, Treva, 2, and Felix, 10 months old.</p>
<p>The pottery and sculptures of both Lee and Yolande are recognized nationally and internationally.  We exhibit both in New Brunswick and abroad, and we have both been the recipients of provincial arts grant funding.</p>
<p>Lee Horus Clark has a large sculptural vessel in the permanent collection of the Beaverbrook Gallery, Fredericton.</p>
<p>Two years ago, after a decade of insecurity, we borrowed more money, and finally moved to our home, a 1/2 acre property in the tiny hamlet (population 75) of Queenstown, in rural New Brunswick.  It took us a year to build our Anagama kiln, and many thousands of borrowed dollars for bricks and materials.  We fired the Queenstown Anagama for the first time in August, when our youngest child, Felix, was 2 weeks old.</p>
<h3>What Happened?</h3>
<p>Although we have experienced considerable adversity in the past, it now seems as though we might be losing everything.  (**Recent *fantastic* developments indicate that actually, everything is salvageable!  Lots of considerable work to be done, but we strongly believe we will be able to save our home, and our kiln will remain!)</p>
<p>Last week, on June 1st, 2013, there was a large and catastrophic oil spill.  Our heating oil tank began to leak, and the oil streamed into the ground behind our house, down the hill, and pooled around our kiln.  </p>
<p>Our water well is located 4 feet from the oil tank.  A stream, that runs directly into the St. John River, is just feet from the kiln, where the oil is concentrating.  (**Thankfully, we acted quickly and so far, we have been able to contain the spill, and protect the stream and the river.  Our well however, has been greatly compromised, and we will likely need to have a new well dug).</p>
<p>We called the New Brunswick Department of the Environment immediately, and we evacuated our family.  </p>
<p>Over the past few days, we have moved our possessions out of our home, as the nightmare has unfolded.  </p>
<h3>What Now?</h3>
<p>We have been informed by the Department of the Environment that our home is uninhabitable, our water undrinkable, and in order to clean up the oil spill responsibly, the property will have to be excavated.  </p>
<p>We have been staying with friends and neighbours for the past few days, and we will be moving in the next week.</p>
<p>The market value of our home, outbuildings and property *before* the oil spill, was about $40,000.</p>
<p>Conservative estimates as to the cost of cleanup, have started at $200,000 *if* we forfeit the house and simply bulldoze it.  (**No!  Recent developments indicate that we will be able to save our home, and that the costs may run to about $100,000, all told.)</p>
<p>This does not include the cost of rebulding the kiln, which will likely have to be moved brick-by-brick, the land excavated, and then re-built using many new bricks (as only a % of the bricks will not be salvageable).</p>
<p>The most sickening and tragic aspects of this situation is that it seems increasingly likely that the oil spill has affected our neighbours' water supply, for which we are again, liable and responsible.</p>
<p>We do not have insurance, but we have been told that as our oil tank was just a couple ofmonths over 10 years old, insurance would not have covered the cost.</p>
<p>Last winter, we used 1/2 a tank of oil for the entire season.  We heat our home primarily with wood.  The oil was only turned on occasionally, when the temperatures dipped down below what was reasonable for our kids, in the early morning. </p>
<p>We have been informed that New Brunswick is one of the only provinces in which the oil company does not bear any responsibility to check the condition of the oil tank prior to filling.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Objective</h3>
<p>Despite the fact that the full cost of clean-up will be much more than $50,000, we are hoping that this amount will be enough to mitigate the very immediate environmental damage of the oil spill, and to ensure that we can protect our neighbours and their water supply.</p>
<p>We are still hoping to somehow salvage our home, and to work towards some day rehabilitating our property.  This will be a long-term project.</p>
<p>But if we do not take steps right now to hire the approved contractors to begin excavations on our property, we will be in contravention of the New Brunswick law, and we could face some serious legal ramifications. </p>
<p>Many people have suggested that we simply walk away from our property.  If we had had a fire, this would be possible.  In cases of contamination such as this, walking away would neither be legal, nor moral or ethical.  We have to pay, and failure to do so would put us in contravention of the law, potentially leading to bankruptcy, or litigation in court.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We need $50,000 to begin the cleanup, and possibly help our neighbours.  Although at this point we do not know what aspect of the cleanup the funds will go to, we give our solemn oath and guarantee that all funds collected here will go towards the mitigation of the oil spill.  The order of priority will look like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protecting or doing restitution to our neighbours *if* it is discovered that their water has been contaminated (either in the form of water filters or the digging of a new well.</li>
<li>Immediate environmental cleanup, in order to mitigate the contamination of the stream and the St. John River.</li>
<li>Environmental cleanup of our land, in order to protect the wider ecosystem. (This would include dismantling our kiln brick-by-brick, attempting to salvage bricks and stone.)</li>
<li>Environmental cleanup of our house: raising the house off the ground, digging out the foundation of our home, removing and safely disposing of all the contaminated material, pouring a new foundation, electrical, etc.</li>
<li>Digging a new water well on our property.</li>
<li>Rebuilding our kiln.</li>
<li>Filing the massive hole with uncontaminated earth.</li>
</ol>
<p>The entire cost will not be covered by this campaign.  However, $50,000 will get us started, and will also help to show the Department of the Environment that we are taking responsibility, and action, for this terrible situation.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We are passionate and committed to our art, and to the land.  We have always used sustainably harvested or scrap wood for our firings.  And the product of our labour, our wood-fired ceramics, are, in many ways, a statement about the beauty of nature, of work, of slowness, and of values that sometimes seem to be fading in our contemporary lives.  </p>
<p>For so many years we have lived on the edge, from the sale of one coffee mug to another.  We have borrowed extensively from our families in order to buy clay, to buy wood, to feed our kids, and to buy our home and property which was the foundation of our hopes for a more sustainable future for our family.</p>
<p>The most pressing issue at the moment however, is to clean up the oil, so that other people, animals, plants and waterways are not damaged any further.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you are not able to contribute financially, please consider spreading the word about this campaign. </p>

<p> </p></div>","Lee & Yolande Clark
We are Lee Horus Clark & Yolande Clark.  We are wood-firing ceramic artists, and we have dedicated our lives to art, to clay, to fire, and to our family for many years. We have worked extremely hard to create a home for our children, and a kiln on our own land. 
We have 3 beautiful children:  Horus, 4, Treva, 2, and Felix, 10 months old.
The pottery and sculptures of both Lee and Yolande are recognized nationally and internationally.  We exhibit both in New Brunswick and abroad, and we have both been the recipients of provincial arts grant funding.
Lee Horus Clark has a large sculptural vessel in the permanent collection of the Beaverbrook Gallery, Fredericton.
Two years ago, after a decade of insecurity, we borrowed more money, and finally moved to our home, a 1/2 acre property in the tiny hamlet (population 75) of Queenstown, in rural New Brunswick.  It took us a year to build our Anagama kiln, and many thousands of borrowed dollars for bricks and materials.  We fired the Queenstown Anagama for the first time in August, when our youngest child, Felix, was 2 weeks old.
What Happened?
Although we have experienced considerable adversity in the past, it now seems as though we might be losing everything.  (**Recent *fantastic* developments indicate that actually, everything is salvageable!  Lots of considerable work to be done, but we strongly believe we will be able to save our home, and our kiln will remain!)
Last week, on June 1st, 2013, there was a large and catastrophic oil spill.  Our heating oil tank began to leak, and the oil streamed into the ground behind our house, down the hill, and pooled around our kiln.  
Our water well is located 4 feet from the oil tank.  A stream, that runs directly into the St. John River, is just feet from the kiln, where the oil is concentrating.  (**Thankfully, we acted quickly and so far, we have been able to contain the spill, and protect the stream and the river.  Our well however, has been greatly compromised, and we will likely need to have a new well dug).
We called the New Brunswick Department of the Environment immediately, and we evacuated our family.  
Over the past few days, we have moved our possessions out of our home, as the nightmare has unfolded.  
What Now?
We have been informed by the Department of the Environment that our home is uninhabitable, our water undrinkable, and in order to clean up the oil spill responsibly, the property will have to be excavated.  
We have been staying with friends and neighbours for the past few days, and we will be moving in the next week.
The market value of our home, outbuildings and property *before* the oil spill, was about $40,000.
Conservative estimates as to the cost of cleanup, have started at $200,000 *if* we forfeit the house and simply bulldoze it.  (**No!  Recent developments indicate that we will be able to save our home, and that the costs may run to about $100,000, all told.)
This does not include the cost of rebulding the kiln, which will likely have to be moved brick-by-brick, the land excavated, and then re-built using many new bricks (as only a % of the bricks will not be salvageable).
The most sickening and tragic aspects of this situation is that it seems increasingly likely that the oil spill has affected our neighbours' water supply, for which we are again, liable and responsible.
We do not have insurance, but we have been told that as our oil tank was just a couple ofmonths over 10 years old, insurance would not have covered the cost.
Last winter, we used 1/2 a tank of oil for the entire season.  We heat our home primarily with wood.  The oil was only turned on occasionally, when the temperatures dipped down below what was reasonable for our kids, in the early morning. 
We have been informed that New Brunswick is one of the only provinces in which the oil company does not bear any responsibility to check the condition of the oil tank prior to filling.  
 
Our Objective
Despite the fact that the full cost of clean-up will be much more than $50,000, we are hoping that this amount will be enough to mitigate the very immediate environmental damage of the oil spill, and to ensure that we can protect our neighbours and their water supply.
We are still hoping to somehow salvage our home, and to work towards some day rehabilitating our property.  This will be a long-term project.
But if we do not take steps right now to hire the approved contractors to begin excavations on our property, we will be in contravention of the New Brunswick law, and we could face some serious legal ramifications. 
Many people have suggested that we simply walk away from our property.  If we had had a fire, this would be possible.  In cases of contamination such as this, walking away would neither be legal, nor moral or ethical.  We have to pay, and failure to do so would put us in contravention of the law, potentially leading to bankruptcy, or litigation in court.
 
What We Need 


We need $50,000 to begin the cleanup, and possibly help our neighbours.  Although at this point we do not know what aspect of the cleanup the funds will go to, we give our solemn oath and guarantee that all funds collected here will go towards the mitigation of the oil spill.  The order of priority will look like this:

Protecting or doing restitution to our neighbours *if* it is discovered that their water has been contaminated (either in the form of water filters or the digging of a new well.
Immediate environmental cleanup, in order to mitigate the contamination of the stream and the St. John River.
Environmental cleanup of our land, in order to protect the wider ecosystem. (This would include dismantling our kiln brick-by-brick, attempting to salvage bricks and stone.)
Environmental cleanup of our house: raising the house off the ground, digging out the foundation of our home, removing and safely disposing of all the contaminated material, pouring a new foundation, electrical, etc.
Digging a new water well on our property.
Rebuilding our kiln.
Filing the massive hole with uncontaminated earth.

The entire cost will not be covered by this campaign.  However, $50,000 will get us started, and will also help to show the Department of the Environment that we are taking responsibility, and action, for this terrible situation.  
 
The Impact


We are passionate and committed to our art, and to the land.  We have always used sustainably harvested or scrap wood for our firings.  And the product of our labour, our wood-fired ceramics, are, in many ways, a statement about the beauty of nature, of work, of slowness, and of values that sometimes seem to be fading in our contemporary lives.  
For so many years we have lived on the edge, from the sale of one coffee mug to another.  We have borrowed extensively from our families in order to buy clay, to buy wood, to feed our kids, and to buy our home and property which was the foundation of our hopes for a more sustainable future for our family.
The most pressing issue at the moment however, is to clean up the oil, so that other people, animals, plants and waterways are not damaged any further.  
 
Other Ways You Can Help


If you are not able to contribute financially, please consider spreading the word about this campaign. 
Also, we urge everyone to either get rid of oil heating in their homes, or to make sure they do a thorough check of their oil tanks every month.  The devastation that this kind of event can cause, is astounding, and heartbreaking, for individual families, as well as communities.

We ask what it means when any powerful group tries to erase culture, attack writers and artists, and control the free exchange of ideas.  

On March 5, 2007, a car bomb exploded in Baghdad's historic literary and intellectual community, named for the famed tenth century Arab poet Al-Mutanabbi. Thirty people were killed; more than a hundred were wounded.
Along with the deeply felt human loss, Baghdad also grieved the attack on its cultural center, a place of lively cafes and thoughtful bookstores, of conversations in tea and tobacco shops. The inventory of al-Mutanabbi Street was as diverse as the Iraqi population, including literature of Iraq and the Middle East, history, political theory, popular novels, scholarly works, religious tracts, technical books, poetry, and mysteries; stationery and blank school notebooks could be purchased on this street, along with children’s books, comics, and magazines. While Arabic was the predominate language, books in Persian, French, German, and English were also represented.In response to the bombing, Beau Beausoleil, a poet and bookseller in San Francisco, put out a worldwide call to artists to respond to this human tragedy and attack on culture. Two hundred and sixty artists from twenty-four countries answered the call, creating original books, some of which you can see in our video: works that reflect both the strength and fragility of printed matter and show the endurance of the ideas within them. 
We, artists and friends of the project, now need to raise $12,000 in order to:- Ship these artists’ books to destinations in the United States, Europe and the Middle East to hold simultaneous exhibitions from 2013 through 2014.- Send 260 Artists’ Books and 130 Letterpress Broadsides to the National Library of Baghdad to be part of their permanent collection.Please contribute and help affirm the commonality of al-Mutanabbi Street with any street, anywhere, that holds a bookstore or cultural institution, a place where ideas are disseminated, debated and discussed. Even a small amount will help affirm a connection between this small street in Baghdad and our own cultural centers, and denounce this attack that was an attack on us all.

</h3> <p>Hello and thank you kindly for taking the time! My name is Doc Diventia, or perhaps more familiar a name, Shane Frost. NO! NOT THE PORN STAR! I am a 
dedicated creature concept artist whom often reflects their work with 
the abstract and the unusual. In turn this also drew distinct abstract and usual worlds as well within my mind. I have believed in the quality of 
subjective meaning as well the fantastical visions of other worldly 
display, and really I just love to portray and reflect upon the work I 
continue. With over Ten different galleries and a host of projects I've 
undertaken down the years, I have lead myself to the most glorifying of all ventures! The realm of children books...but for adults!...who might be kids!...again.</p>
<h3>But Doc, Why would we give you money?</h3>
<p>I'm really glad you asked, representation of possibly one of you. Well 
Here's the thing, I've been working on a most fascinating and strange 
book for a little while. It hits a bit right here, my chest I mean, 
where my heart is. Let me show you! If I could just...where 
is....Christ, help me.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/848197/files/20140910143114-cover_title_small.png?1410384674"" src="""" style=""""/></p>I'm not the best with titles alright? What I am alright with however is weird  adventures! This is where you giving me money comes in. I want to make this book a reality on real paper. Paper that I can damage and rough up real good and then force others and you to read. It will be weird. It may not have a point and It won't appeal to cephalopods. It will be weird though, I mean that. <br/> <br/><h3> Okay well what kind of book is it really?</h3>
<p>Doc Diventia's Book For Kids Who Are Now Adults But Might Be 
Kids...Again. Is a children's book styled art novel with multiple short 
visual stories ranging from stress disorder with social anxiety to 
learning Numbers with a horrible being beyond human comprehension. Each 
slice of a tale can have multiple meanings, sometimes no meanings at 
all. It can be inspiring and then depressing, but let's look on the 
positive with a few examples below!</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Well that was weird.</h3>
<p>I know, right? It only gets more weird, or normal for some of you very 
special people. I need your help though because I can make the book big, bigger
 even. With the intent to eventually Publish it and just throw money at 
whoever I can to make printed copies, I want to make this book happen. 
With your help we can see a weird kind of book with even more abstract  tales 
come into the hands of many and who knows, we might do more good than 
we're about to do bad!</p>
<h3>So What Does All The Money Go Into?</h3>
<p>STOP ASKING SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT I CANT- ... I mean... All pledges 
made will go absolutely into production and printing coverage costs 
necessary to produce high quality physical copies of the book! Besides 
what is taken out by these leeches, every single penny is going into these 
things. I'm not in this for making a profit. I'm not asking for your 
help because I want to eat ( even though I really, really want to right 
now. ) I'm asking, even pleading because it's a dream to me. A dream to 
see what this can be and chase it.  <br/></p>
<h3> Let's be real for a second.</h3>
<p>I know I come  rather off the beaten path and lord help me that's probably true. What I am though is an artist and in many ways still a human finding his way among the rest of you. With this outreach I am extending my hand out to you all and doing the one thing that terrifies me most. Making contact. <br/></p>
<p>  I  know I cannot offer like others with extravagant rewards and showy givings that pat you on the head and make you feel like you got the collector's edition....but... what I offer is the fullest of my appreciations for the first run I've ever made as a timid artist. Offering the chance of companionship as we make this book happen and above that, offering the chance to see yourself in it's pages for others to see as well. I know we can do this, I've my heart set on it and the biggest reward to myself is just seeing it through for the first time.  </p>
<h3>OKAY NOW THE REWARDS!</h3>
<p>Just because they may not be big time, doesn't mean I'm skimping out altogether. There needs to be incentives, there needs to be draw. Allure, my own special kind of way to thank all of those who even look at this thing without spitting on me. That's why I'm going into this head first with my fists open air. How? Why, raffles of course.</p>
<p>Unlike the perks listed off to the side, these are their own separate rewards altogether. Let's cut into the turkey however and explain how this goes down. <br/></p>
<p>* These rewards are dependent upon the success of funding goals.</p>
<p>Up To Three Raffles can be held in honor of those that have helped make this happen.<br/></p>
<p>Raffle #1 $250 Met- One original character of the winner's choice to
 be placed on one of the many pages. Or just you...you know..if you're not so original... It could be anywhere. Doing 
anything. Spooky. They'll also be done in the style of the story! Even 
more spooky! Your character as well you will be credited on the special 
thanks page so you don't sue! Spookiest!</p>
<p>Raffle #2 $500 Met-  One original character of the winner's choice in a short story. ( 4-5 
Pages, even more. I'm crazy. ) You can whisper in my ear the theme you would wish for or you can let me go wild with it. May be good, may be bad for you.</p>
<p>Raffle #3 $1000 Met- I will find someone to produce a hard cover version of the complete book,
 ship it to myself and damage it in various ways ( The way it was meant 
to be )  then ship it to you, the winner. shipping on me. 
It will be one of a kind ( Unless you count Patreon but I STILL STAND BY MY WORDS ), you lucky person you! * This one might take a 
small bit to get worked out so don't freak. I got your back!<br/></p>
</div><h3>The Risk<br/>
</h3><div>Yes, there is that horrible word. I want to erase that thing. Makes all of this seem like I'll drag you all to hell for even assisting me. Relax, I'm going alone. There are always risks when it comes to any project, whether it's inside or outside. For me it would be the outside. I could be screwed over by bad publishers, the guys handling print might suddenly have amnesia and forget I placed an order and threw money at them. A world of issues in the infinity numbers. We're not about numbers though are we? No, we're about seeing this happen. Let's be positive!....right?</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> Some of you may not have the wallets for all this. Some of you may despise children's books and think I'm the next Hitler for even having a go at this. Regardless of your situation or disposition, there is a way to benefit myself even without the use of your wallet or hearing you curse me to the high heavens and lowest hells. Spread the word. Spare a link, take a minute or two just to nudge others along here. They may hate it as much as you do or even love it as much. With that being said, I hope we can make all this work come together in a glorious flaming wreck! <br/>

things. I'm not in this for making a profit. I'm not asking for your 
help because I want to eat ( even though I really, really want to right 
now. ) I'm asking, even pleading because it's a dream to me. A dream to 
see what this can be and chase it.  
 Let's be real for a second.
I know I come  rather off the beaten path and lord help me that's probably true. What I am though is an artist and in many ways still a human finding his way among the rest of you. With this outreach I am extending my hand out to you all and doing the one thing that terrifies me most. Making contact. 
  I  know I cannot offer like others with extravagant rewards and showy givings that pat you on the head and make you feel like you got the collector's edition....but... what I offer is the fullest of my appreciations for the first run I've ever made as a timid artist. Offering the chance of companionship as we make this book happen and above that, offering the chance to see yourself in it's pages for others to see as well. I know we can do this, I've my heart set on it and the biggest reward to myself is just seeing it through for the first time.  
OKAY NOW THE REWARDS!
Just because they may not be big time, doesn't mean I'm skimping out altogether. There needs to be incentives, there needs to be draw. Allure, my own special kind of way to thank all of those who even look at this thing without spitting on me. That's why I'm going into this head first with my fists open air. How? Why, raffles of course.
Unlike the perks listed off to the side, these are their own separate rewards altogether. Let's cut into the turkey however and explain how this goes down. 
* These rewards are dependent upon the success of funding goals.
Up To Three Raffles can be held in honor of those that have helped make this happen.
Raffle #1 $250 Met- One original character of the winner's choice to
 be placed on one of the many pages. Or just you...you know..if you're not so original... It could be anywhere. Doing 
anything. Spooky. They'll also be done in the style of the story! Even 
more spooky! Your character as well you will be credited on the special 
thanks page so you don't sue! Spookiest!
Raffle #2 $500 Met-  One original character of the winner's choice in a short story. ( 4-5 
Pages, even more. I'm crazy. ) You can whisper in my ear the theme you would wish for or you can let me go wild with it. May be good, may be bad for you.
Raffle #3 $1000 Met- I will find someone to produce a hard cover version of the complete book,
 ship it to myself and damage it in various ways ( The way it was meant 
to be )  then ship it to you, the winner. shipping on me. 
It will be one of a kind ( Unless you count Patreon but I STILL STAND BY MY WORDS ), you lucky person you! * This one might take a 
small bit to get worked out so don't freak. I got your back!
The Risk
Yes, there is that horrible word. I want to erase that thing. Makes all of this seem like I'll drag you all to hell for even assisting me. Relax, I'm going alone. There are always risks when it comes to any project, whether it's inside or outside. For me it would be the outside. I could be screwed over by bad publishers, the guys handling print might suddenly have amnesia and forget I placed an order and threw money at them. A world of issues in the infinity numbers. We're not about numbers though are we? No, we're about seeing this happen. Let's be positive!....right?  Other Ways You Can Help Some of you may not have the wallets for all this. Some of you may despise children's books and think I'm the next Hitler for even having a go at this. Regardless of your situation or disposition, there is a way to benefit myself even without the use of your wallet or hearing you curse me to the high heavens and lowest hells. Spread the word. Spare a link, take a minute or two just to nudge others along here. They may hate it as much as you do or even love it as much. With that being said, I hope we can make all this work come together in a glorious flaming wreck!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Where We've Been</h3>
<p>Two years in the East Bay art scene has taught us a great deal, and now, with 6 events under our belt, we are looking to go the next step. </p>
<p>Our first show included a gallery and some food, and a host of open studios.  Since then we have added a design bazaar, fashion shows, a theater, more open studios, free BART shuttles, and much, much more. The attendance has been great, and support from our community has been extraordinary.</p>
<p>What we want to do now is huge: we are pulling together resources for one last time- and in doing so help us launch a self-sustaining show, that needs no fundraisers or outside donations to exist- while still remaing free and open to the public.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where We're Going</h3>
<p>We need $3500 raised to throw the next F3. Beleive it or not, each show costs us this little amount to put on! F3 is an all-volunteer effort, and so our costs stay minimal. Our volunteers are amazing- and it is their fault we can do so much with so little!</p>
<p>Your donation will go a long way- our expenses go primarily to transportation- our event shuttles, security and event insurance- but out of that you'll get to help ensure that we have a ton more of these in the years to come! </p>
<p>F3 is a unique experience- get a first hand look at a thriving arts community, buy some cool stuff, check out the latest works of our residents and guest artists from around the Bay Area- all around, a fun and cheap night for everybody.</p>
<p>Donors will receive F3 stuff- Stickers, Magnets, T-Shirts, gifts from our residents, and VIP treatment at the event- all just to help out an organization you were already thinking of donating to! See perks below for more info.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>F3 has a great impact on the arts community- showcasing local art to an area burgeoning with great work, but not enough outlets or access points to get the community involved. This is where we come in- F3 is, and has always been FREE and open to the public, allowing better access to those who might not normally fit an art show into their schedule or budget.</p>
<p>We've done 6 of these shows, so we know what we're doing. Your donation will only allow us to grow and make a better art show!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please post the link to this on your various social networking sites, we are looking to raise this money quick! And we need your help ASAP. </p>
<p>We also need volunteers for the day of the show- if you think you'd like to help us set up for the event, or work the front desk, or anything else, please contact us at <a href=""mailto:info@f3oakland.com,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@f3oakland.com,</a> and we'll get you set up!</p>

<p><strong><br/></strong>PY // Art From Parkland's Youth is an art exhibition being put on by Sarah Wise. Sarah holds a BFA in Graphic Design from Pacific Lutheran University in her home town of Parkland, WA. She is currently working towards her MA in Arts Administration from the Savannah College of Art and Design, and this is her final project for that degree. The purpose of this show is to build positive community relationships through art. The students of the local Franklin Pierce School District's two high schools will submit their own original artwork to a jury comprised of PLU students, who will determine which pieces go on display in the Wekell Gallery at PLU. The community will then be invited to a weekend-long exhibition featuring this artwork, showcasing the creative talent found right here in Parkland.</p>
<h2><strong>PY // Art From Parkland’s Youth Business Sponsorship</strong></h2>
<p>Businesses may contribute to PY // Art From Parkland’s Youth in a variety of ways. The following are suggested levels of participation. Local businesses wishing to support the Parkland community and this project are encouraged to do so in any way they see fit. For more information about the PY // Art From Parkland’s Youth project, Like us on Facebook at facebook.com/pyartshow.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Donations</span></p>
<p>Monetary donations are accepted. Contributions in any amount will be accepted. Funds will go towards the following:</p>

<li>Printing of all promotional materials for the show</li>
<li>Art supplies to help students prepare their work for the gallery space</li>

PY // Art From Parkland's Youth is an art exhibition being put on by Sarah Wise. Sarah holds a BFA in Graphic Design from Pacific Lutheran University in her home town of Parkland, WA. She is currently working towards her MA in Arts Administration from the Savannah College of Art and Design, and this is her final project for that degree. The purpose of this show is to build positive community relationships through art. The students of the local Franklin Pierce School District's two high schools will submit their own original artwork to a jury comprised of PLU students, who will determine which pieces go on display in the Wekell Gallery at PLU. The community will then be invited to a weekend-long exhibition featuring this artwork, showcasing the creative talent found right here in Parkland.

<h3>Passionate paintor.</h3>
<p>I am a passionate painter who loves the story and beauty in old peoples faces. Been painting since I was a kid and cant stop. I have five years of artschool. In helping me, you will help me accomplish one of my long time dreams. To make a huge carbon painting. 2 meters or more tall. I fell for the expression of this old lady. I believe the final result of such a big painting will be breathtaking.</p>
<p>I have five years of schooling in art,  which doesnt count for much in finding a job so I am struggeling to find one.. So while I apply and am in wait for a job, I can use the free time to create this great image.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The funding goes towards:</h3>
<p>The funding goes to a special paper that can handle continous work, it is not sold here in Norway, so I have to have it shipped here and the rest will go to the framing, which is the bulk of the funding.</p>
<p>Once the painting is completed I plan to  exhibit it, and ""wow"" people with the beauty of age.</p>

<p>It doesnt have to be money,  if you know a framer or someone who has paper, that will help too. The best paper for this work is; <strong>Canson Fineface paper</strong>. Maybe you happen to have a roll of it and you arent using it? I know there are 10 meter rolls sold of this particular paper.</p>
<p>Please spread the word. Any help and support is greatly appreciated and I will keep my funders informed along the way about the process.</p>

<p>aerophagics contemporary is a fictional art gallery.  It questions (on the Web) the visibility and communication of institutions, galleries and actors in the field of art.  In the manner of a semionaut, it conducts a critique of social networks and the art market.  The latter is based on exclusion, because it concentrates exclusively on certain names which become products, the artistic value of which develops for the benefit of the market.  I was determined to create my own “stable” by giving it a name and logo.  To attain this positioning, I created a Facebook page and a stick with the same name affixed on the window of the premises during a stint as artist in residence in Ixelles.  aerophagics contemporary was included in the web page of Ixelles, as the opportunity arose, and is listed as a gallery established on the territory of that municipality.  aerophagics was thus made official and institutionalised, or at least it is henceforth visible “on the art scene.” What started as an appearance or illusion of an art gallery, at least from the outside, has now become reality.</p>
<p>In partnership with the AesP studio of the ArBA-Esa, I shared this project (in 2009-2010) with the students of that studio.  They created avatars on social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, by providing archetypes on how a gallery should be run “properly” by means of poses struck by aerophagics contemporary employees, artists, and collectors.  This fictitious entrepreneurial assemblage promoted mock discussions (exchanged e-mails) between collecting avatars and non-fictitious artists.  In order not to linger on a misleading false parody of supply and demand, genuine fictional works by artists gradually emerged through artistic productions and constructed identities (biographies, profiles and historical contexts, questions about art, philosophical discussions, etc) to lead to a real, autonomous identity, which continues to develop in cyberspace today by modelling exchange and information and by the note of the principles of interaction.  Some of these fictional creations were consigned on audio and visual media.  All this work can be viewed at the following address: <a href=""http://aerophagics.com/aerophagics-contemporary.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://aerophagics.com/aerophagics-contemporary.html</a></p>
<p>I am currently seeking funding to produce a soapbox derby racer of a Delahaye 135M.  If this soapbox derby racer is produced, it will enable me to take part in various soapbox championships in Europe and the world.  Most people who make soapbox derby racers think only of such aspects as aerodynamics, weight and speed.  For its part, aerophagics prefers to focus on such aspects as appearance, shape and visual impact.  In fact, although this project is a virtual gallery, it is still a project that enables me to reflect on the question of entrepreneurship and its dominant form today:  the company. <br/> I have drawn myself all the plans needed to build the soapbox derby racer using an AutoCAD software.  I have created 3D images using the 4D cinema software.  Having no skills to build the soapbox derby racer, I have turned to a former world champion in the field who has the technical tools and expertise to see the project through. <br/> He agrees to make the soapbox and was very impressed by the finesse of the plans I produced.  As he has a numeric control device, the 3D plans that I produced using AutoCAD will enable us to make a true to scale polystyrene mould, i.e. 309 cm x 129 cm x 51 cm.  Once the mould has been produced, we are going to use it to make the body in fibreglass.  To reduce costs, I will see to all the finishing works (painting, lettering, etc.).</p>
<p><br/> These €15,000 will be used to</p>
<p>Produce the soapbox derby racer true to scale <br/><br/> Build the bodywork.<br/> Build the chassis <br/> Finishing (painting, seat, etc..)</p>
<p>Produce two suits with the colours of aerophagics</p>
<p>Produce two helmets with the colours of aerophagics</p>
<p>I will assume the transport costs to participate in the first events.</p>
<p>If the funds I raise are not sufficient to see this project through I will reinvest them in a publication project I am pursuing with a group of young Brussels artists.</p>

<p>Jeune artiste diplômé de l’ArBA-esa de Bruxelles, je suis actuellement assistant conférencier dans l’atelier (AesP) au sein du même établissement.

<p>aerophagics contemporary est une galerie d’art fictive. Sur le web, elle questionne la visibilité et la communication des institutions, des galeries et des acteurs du champ de l’art. À la manière d’un sémionaute, elle trace une critique des réseaux sociaux et du marché de l’art.Le marché de l’art est basé sur l’exclusion, car il se concentre uniquement sur quelques noms qui deviennent des produits dont les valeurs artistiques évoluent au profit du marché. J ‘ai eu la volonté de créer ma propre ‘écurie’ en lui attribuant un nom et un logo : aerophagics contemporary. Pour la réalisation de ce positionnement, j’ai crée une page facebook et un sticker éponyme collé sur la vitrine des locaux  pendant une résidence d’artiste  à Ixelles.  aerophagics contemporary a été reprise, par opportunité, sur la page web de la commune d’Ixelles et répertoriée comme étant une galerie d’art implanté sur son territoire. aerophagics contemporary s’en est retrouvée officialisée, institutionnalisée, ou du moins, sa visibilité ‘sur la place de l’art’ était désormais acquise.

Ce montage, entrepreneurial fictif, a donné lieu à des simulacres de discussions (échanges mails) entre avatars collectionneurs et artistes non fictifs. Pour ne pas en rester à une fausse parodie trompeuse, de l'offre et la demande, de véritables fictions d'artistes se sont progressivement constituées  par des productions artistiques et des identités construites (biographies, profils &amp; contextes historiques, questionnements sur l'art, débats philosophiques etc.) pour aboutir à de véritables identités, autonomes, qui, aujourd'hui encore, continuent à évoluer dans l'espace cybernétique par la modélisation de l'échange et de l'information et par le billet, des principes d'interaction.

<p><strong>[TRP]</strong> è un <strong>progetto nato sette anni fa</strong> come una sfida tra amici appassionati di poesia e video. ""Perché non creiamo nella nostra città un festival dedicato alla poesia e alla videopoesia?"". La risposta è stata [TRP] Trevigliopoesia. Un <strong>festival di poesia e di videopoesia</strong>, appunto. Ma non solo.</p>
<p>In questi anni [TRP] è diventato anche un luogo in cui la parola poetica si confronta con la fotografia, il teatro, la musica, la danza, la filosofia: all'insegna della <strong>contaminazione</strong>, del confronto fra la poesia e gli altri linguaggi, artistici e non.</p>
<p>E infine [TRP] ha iniziato a condurre una vera e propria <strong>guerriglia poetica</strong>, attraverso azioni di performance art urbana, per riappropriarsi poeticamente degli spazi cittadini liberando la creatività e lottando contro la dittatura del meccanismo automatico, che imprigiona i nostri giorni e uccide la poesia.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>CHE COSA TI CHIEDIAMO</strong></h2>
<p>In tutti questi anni<strong> [TRP]</strong> è riuscito a sostenersi grazie a sponsor privati e istituzionali, primo fra tutti il Comune di Treviglio. Ora, in questo periodo di forte crisi economica, <strong>[TRP]</strong> chiede anche<strong> il tuo aiuto per continuare a esistere e resistere</strong>.</p>
<p>Lo chiede <strong>a te che ci hai seguito con interesse e affetto fin dal primo momento</strong>: per regalarti un'edizione, quella di quest'anno, all'altezza delle precedenti e speriamo migliore. Il tuo aiuto sarà per noi un motivo per impegnarci ancora di più.</p>
<p>E lo chiede<strong> a te</strong> <strong>che non ci conosci</strong>, perché la tua mano tesa possa essere l'inizio di una lunga amicizia. Ci impegneremo per non deludere la tua scommessa su di noi.</p>
<p>L'<strong>obiettivo</strong> che ci poniamo è raccogliere, grazie al tuo aiuto,<strong> 3.000 €</strong>. Tale cifra servirà a coprire alcune spese fondamentali (come quelle per gli ospiti e la comunicazione) per<strong> l'edizione 2013 del festival, che si svolgerà a Treviglio (BG) dal 24 maggio al 2 giugno</strong>. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>COME VOGLIAMO RINGRAZIARTI</strong></h2>
<p>Per ringraziarti del tuo contributo ti invieremo un piccolo dono pensato appositamente per te: una <strong>cartolina di [TRP] a tiratura limitata</strong> firmata da tutti i componenti dello staff.

I am trying to raise money to send a painting I spent months on to London for the BP Portrait Competition. The BP Portrait Competition is one of the biggest portrait competitions of the year. The first prize is 30,000 euro and even to make it into the show as a finalist is an honor that can open doors for you. It is international so submissions are received from all over and I want so so badly to be able to compete. I have submitted my entry already, but the competition requires you send the painting to the venue for judging to get into the show. When I looked up specs for air freight to London (sea would have been cheaper, but would have taken too long and I wouldn't have made the deadline) my lowest quote (out of MANY) was $1,200.00 :( I was not anticipating such a high shipping rate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For those of you who may or may not know me, I recently started my own small business in November of 2012. Although I have experienced some moderate success in the last few months of being open, every dollar I make is still being invested right back into the business. I simply do not have the financial wiggle room to be able to spend $1,200.00 on shipping in light of the other overhead expenses I have running my business.</p>

<p>Still, I am a stubborn S.O.B. and I'm not willing to throw in the towel just yet.

<p><a href=""http://www.blocprojects.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bloc Projects</a> is an artist-led gallery space. Established in 2002 in Sheffield, the gallery sits in a complex of former steel-working buildings, home to Bloc Studios and its artists and makers. We don’t draw any income from this community, but rent our space within them. Over our 13 years we have welcomed thousands of guests and supported hundreds of early and mid career artists, through exhibitions, performance events, screenings, talk, workshops, mentoring sessions, gigs, parties, fetes and more.</p>
<p>In 2014, faced with funding problems and closure, we took the decision to expand our premises to offer a better standard of facilities and increase our ability to bring in much needed funds. After considering moving to a new site, we decided to remain as part of the Bloc Studios community and keep cultural activity in an historic part of the city that is undergoing change through demolition and development. </p>
<p>We were successful in raising most of the funds needed to enable us to undertake a small-scale build project. We have expanded the original squared gallery and are currently in the process of creating on-street access. Although we have raised and sourced the majority of the funding, we need your help to finish the process.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What we'll do with the funds<br/>
</h3>
<p>A total of £3000 will enable us to add disability access, toilets, a small shop area, improved storage, office space and a more visible frontage. <br/></p>
<p>An additional £2000 will give us further improvements, making the gallery able to be easily blacked out for events such as screenings and performances, and providing us with better and more energy efficient lighting. <br/></p>
<p>All our work meets building regulations and is done with the support of Sheffield-based architecture social enterprise <a href=""http://www.studiopolpo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Studio Polpo</a>. <br/></p>

Bloc Projects is an artist-led gallery space. Established in 2002 in Sheffield, the gallery sits in a complex of former steel-working buildings, home to Bloc Studios and its artists and makers. We don’t draw any income from this community, but rent our space within them. Over our 13 years we have welcomed thousands of guests and supported hundreds of early and mid career artists, through exhibitions, performance events, screenings, talk, workshops, mentoring sessions, gigs, parties, fetes and more.
In 2014, faced with funding problems and closure, we took the decision to expand our premises to offer a better standard of facilities and increase our ability to bring in much needed funds. After considering moving to a new site, we decided to remain as part of the Bloc Studios community and keep cultural activity in an historic part of the city that is undergoing change through demolition and development. 
We were successful in raising most of the funds needed to enable us to undertake a small-scale build project. We have expanded the original squared gallery and are currently in the process of creating on-street access. Although we have raised and sourced the majority of the funding, we need your help to finish the process.

What we'll do with the funds

A total of £3000 will enable us to add disability access, toilets, a small shop area, improved storage, office space and a more visible frontage. 
An additional £2000 will give us further improvements, making the gallery able to be easily blacked out for events such as screenings and performances, and providing us with better and more energy efficient lighting. 
All our work meets building regulations and is done with the support of Sheffield-based architecture social enterprise Studio Polpo. 

Thank you! 

We greatly appreciate any support you can offer our project - every contribution helps. Read below for details of what we'll give you in return! 
If you can't donate but would like to support us in another way, get in touch.

<p><i>It's the year 2016, and the world has been overtaken by neon-clad renegades starving for sustenance and comfort in a land full of desire, self-discovery, and radical transformation. The New Barbarians roam the dusty horizon aboard their massive steed, Jurassic Pork, on a quest to spread its bountiful stock of flesh surrendered by pastured hogs.  The only hope for the few remaining survivors living amongst the playa is to join a never-ending feast suitable for King Horik himself as we share amongst the generosity of our humble leader, JP, and amalgamate ever closer to becoming one.</i><br/> </p>
<h3>Dear Burners &amp; Friends,</h3>
<p>The New Barbarians are here to welcome you to our first Jurassic Pork Fundraiser! This is our third year bringing sustenance and endless comfort in a desert land full of desire, self-discovery, and radical transformation. Among other gifts, we deliver nourishment in the form of tasty sausages to the mouths of any hungry souls we meet during feeding time. We need your help to ensure that Jurassic Pork, our art car that is our means of delivering meaty (and vegetarian) fare beyond the realms of our camp, will be fit and tough enough to travel around the playa, rescuing hungry and wretched burners from near-starvation.</p>

<p>Two seasons of sausage slanging have taken their toll on our beloved JP. The dino diagnosis from our Barbarian docs is that the following repairs, improvements, and support are needed in order to ensure a healthy and glorious third run of spreading wiener love all across the playa:</p>
<ul>
<li>New electrical wiring, light sequencer, and LED strip lights to illuminate the beast and catch the attention of deliriously starving burners (two years of fun has taken its toll)</li>
<li>New air filter</li>
<li>New generator (last year’s ate too much playa)</li>
<li>Engine tune-up</li>
<li>A new tire</li>
<li>And last but not least…. WIENERS!!! We hope to bring at least 2000 more gourmet meat and vegetable sausages this year!</li>

</div></div>","It's the year 2016, and the world has been overtaken by neon-clad renegades starving for sustenance and comfort in a land full of desire, self-discovery, and radical transformation. The New Barbarians roam the dusty horizon aboard their massive steed, Jurassic Pork, on a quest to spread its bountiful stock of flesh surrendered by pastured hogs.  The only hope for the few remaining survivors living amongst the playa is to join a never-ending feast suitable for King Horik himself as we share amongst the generosity of our humble leader, JP, and amalgamate ever closer to becoming one. 
Dear Burners & Friends,
The New Barbarians are here to welcome you to our first Jurassic Pork Fundraiser! This is our third year bringing sustenance and endless comfort in a desert land full of desire, self-discovery, and radical transformation. Among other gifts, we deliver nourishment in the form of tasty sausages to the mouths of any hungry souls we meet during feeding time. We need your help to ensure that Jurassic Pork, our art car that is our means of delivering meaty (and vegetarian) fare beyond the realms of our camp, will be fit and tough enough to travel around the playa, rescuing hungry and wretched burners from near-starvation.


We are... 
a group of 30+ strong from around the world, working to construct a camp at 7:30 & A that will feature the following events and amenities for all to enjoy:

Sausage sizzles at 1-2pm every day, made complete with delicious DJ sessions to boogie and chow down to on our large, shaded, carpeted dance floor and couch lounge area.
Tuesday night fiesta featuring special guest DJs, live painting, and sausages galore
2-story tower with shade, hammocks & cargo net lounging and glorious views of sunrises, sunsets and everything in between
Dome, art, handmade jewelry gifts, yoga, and much more!

We ask for your help in funding various repairs and improvements to Jurassic Pork, our beloved art car.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Rhiannon D'Averc, and I am in my final year of studying a BA in Photography at the University of Hertfordshire. I have recently been offered the chance to put on a joint exhibition (along with fellow student Ila Desai) at The Castle, Wellingborough. This is my first exhibition, and as I am simultaneously working on prints for my degree exhibition, I need to raise money to cover the expenses of the shoots (paying models and MUAs, making test prints, and making the final prints).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The exhibition is titled 'Youth in Bloom'. Combining the idea of a flower bursting into it's first bloom with that of a young model coming into their first real flush of life and success, the images are vibrant and full of life. The models stare out with a gaze that both challenges you and invites you to enjoy life in the way they so clearly do.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The figure of £320 will cover expenses as follows (approximate $ values in brackets):</p>
<p>Hahnemuhle paper for printing - £65 ($103.08)</p>
<p>Test prints - £10 ($15.86)</p>
<p>Printing costs (ie ink, use of printer, wall fastenings etc) - £50 ($79.24)</p>
<p>MUA travel expenses - £30 ($47.58)</p>
<p>Model travel expenses - £70 ($111.08)</p>
<p>Props - £25 ($39.67)</p>
<p>Literature (list of contributors and sponsors, models' names, about the artist) - £45 ($71.4)</p>
<p>Getting to the gallery to hang work and attend opening night - £25 ($39.67)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any money raised above the target will be put towards improving the quality of the exhibition. Significant contributors can request a mention in literature placed at the exhibition space (money raised above the goal could also be put towards the production of a leaflet or blurb listing contributors and sponsors).</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share the campaign, spread the word about the exhibition, and even come down and have a look when we open in April!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">with an emphasis on mental health,</h3>

<p>We are building a production company based on our values of health, art, and community and our first project is a show blending stand-up comedy, poetry, and storytelling that we will take touring to universities around the country.

<p>Our hope is that this project will not only help us sustain ourselves as artists, but also give us an avenue toward creating lasting artistic community on campuses across the U.S. As we tour, we bring with us our sense of community and our values: the destigmatizing of mental health, the healing power of laughter and dialogue, and the idea that every person has a story to tell and that they deserve to be given the space to tell it.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">To speak, to be heard, and to feel safe doing so.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Community is not as simple as sitting in a room with other people like us. In fact, we’ve often found ourselves most nurtured by sharing our experiences with those who are not like us, who have other, different stories to tell that help us expand our perspective. When we listen to each other, we are able to find a deeper commonality in spite of our differences, one that allows us to support each other meaningfully which is not the same as always agreeing.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>If we want to be successful we need to be moving in several directions at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic press kit, a digital portfolio used as both publicity and as an informational tool for clients and collaborators</li>
<li>General marketing and advertisement to start bringing in clients via traditional means</li>
<li>Trial workshops to help us refine how we approach creating effective collaborative spaces for students and not to lose sight of the human and community side of things</li>
<li>Business cards and domain name for our website in order to network outside of our own communities</li>

<p>When you donate to us, when you support us in any way, you are helping us carry these beliefs into being-- helping us work to shape a world where there is an insistence on struggling together, on respecting each other, and on creating meaningful art.</p>
<p>This is our first round of fundraising. If we meet these goals, we will be able to start looking toward funding our next steps. There is so much more that we want to do, so much work that we believe is essential, especially now, but we want to start small and stay humble. We want to make sure that if this becomes real and blossoms into something larger than we expect, it is because you all believe in it as deeply as we do.</p>

<p><strong>Did you know that Frida Kahlo spent a considerable amount of time in San Francisco?</strong><strong> <br/><br/></strong>*Aside from Mexico, New York City and Paris, San Francisco was one of her favorite places to be. <br/> *She spent many days watching her husband, Diego Rivera, paint commissioned murals all over the Bay Area and many days visiting her doctor, whose practice was in San Francisco. <br/> *A handful of Diego's murals exist in the San Francisco Bay (and other parts of Califas). A Diego Mural at SF City College has an image of Frida working on a painting. (It really is her painting; Diego insisted she paint the piece herself.)<br/> *She created many pieces of art while inside the 7x7 (San Francisco is 49 square miles). Having been born in July, she loved the number 7! <br/> *Emmy Lou Packard was a well-known San Francisco artist and photographer; she was one of Frida's favorite lover bois. They spent much time together in The City by the Bay and en La Casa Azul.<br/> *In 1931, Frida's painting ""Frieda and Diego Rivera"" showed at the ""Sixth Annual Exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artists""-- the first public showing of her work. <br/><br/> *In 2013, La Comunidad de San Francisco celebrated Frida Kahlo's 103rd and 106th birthday with much song, dance, art and revelry. (She was born in 1907, but chose 1910 as her birth year in honor of the start of the Mexican Revolution). No one had ever seen so many Fridas in one place--outside of the city of Houston Texas. (They've been celebrating Frida for over 10 years now!)</p>

Did you know that Frida Kahlo spent a considerable amount of time in San Francisco? *Aside from Mexico, New York City and Paris, San Francisco was one of her favorite places to be.  *She spent many days watching her husband, Diego Rivera, paint commissioned murals all over the Bay Area and many days visiting her doctor, whose practice was in San Francisco.  *A handful of Diego's murals exist in the San Francisco Bay (and other parts of Califas). A Diego Mural at SF City College has an image of Frida working on a painting. (It really is her painting; Diego insisted she paint the piece herself.) *She created many pieces of art while inside the 7x7 (San Francisco is 49 square miles). Having been born in July, she loved the number 7!  *Emmy Lou Packard was a well-known San Francisco artist and photographer; she was one of Frida's favorite lover bois. They spent much time together in The City by the Bay and en La Casa Azul. *In 1931, Frida's painting ""Frieda and Diego Rivera"" showed at the ""Sixth Annual Exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artists""-- the first public showing of her work.  *In 2013, La Comunidad de San Francisco celebrated Frida Kahlo's 103rd and 106th birthday with much song, dance, art and revelry. (She was born in 1907, but chose 1910 as her birth year in honor of the start of the Mexican Revolution). No one had ever seen so many Fridas in one place--outside of the city of Houston Texas. (They've been celebrating Frida for over 10 years now!)
Okay, we haven’t done it yet. Fiestas Fridas needs your help to make it so!
This inaugural event celebrates the Life of Frida Kahlo and her relationship with the San Francisco Bay Area. As the most Famous Mexican Artist of all time, her artistic expression of self, life, love and pain are universal themes that continue to impact artists worldwide.

The Kalamata Street Festival is an international, voluntary, non-commercial festival, which aims to offer the open space to young artists and athletes to present and promote their work. It is a broader co-organisation of several local associations, organisations and informal groups with the coordination of the Youth Centre of Kalamata and the youth organization K.A.NE..

By supporting the 8th Kalamata Street Festival, you support the young artists, the young athletes, the cooperation between the organizations of the community, the graffiti artists who cannot express their art because they are considered vandals, the skaters who are kicked out of the neighborhood because they were making noise, the youth groups who don’t have the capacity to present their work to the public.
By supporting the 8th Kalamata Street Festival you support the DIY activities and you prove wrong, all those who believe that everything in life should be commercial. You prove wrong all those who believe that with low budget you cannot do something big.
Well… the Kalamata Street Festival is a very low budget festival but in parallel it offers quality and quantity. It offers 10 to 20 parallel activities.

THE SUPPORT WE ASK:
As we previously referred the Kalamata Street Festival has a free entrance policy but at the same time it hosts many artists from all over Greece and Europe. Also having 10-20 parallel events, means that needs are increasing.  The main expense is artists travel expenses and accommodation.
With your help we can raise 3000€ that we need in order to make this festival was it deserves and give as more opportunities as we can to as more young artists as we can… The support that we are asking from you, is a small donation and to help us with the dissemination of our event to entities of artistic and cultural nature in our country.
According to your donation, we have some small “presents” for you. Support us and get from a personalised photo collection to a full “festival’s box” and your name at the sponsors’ page.
The Impact
The Kalamata Street Festival is quite an important event as it offers the open space to the youth. It boosts their creativity and promotes their work.

The international character of the festival is having a big impact to the local community, multiculturalism, exchange of good practices, new ideas born during the festival and all these through great fun!
We will not speak about any theoretical impact, which this festival might have, we we’ll speak about the results of the previous ones…
-  an informal network of associations, civil organisations and public organisations was created in our small city
-  hundreds of people got motivated to participate and become active volunteers of the festival

<h3>Bonjour à tous et à toutes !<br/>
</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Qui êtes-vous..?</b></p>
<p>Nous sommes 2 jeunes étudiants, Jennifer &amp; Quentin, tous deux passionnés par le théâtre.<br/>Nos chemins se sont croisés il y a 3ans, au papillon noir théâtre à Caen, et depuis nous ne nous sommes pas quittés et continuons de faire notre route ensemble !<br/><br/></p>
<p><b>Et, que faites-vous au juste..dans la vie..?</b></p>
<p>Du théâtre !<br/></p>Nous venons de terminer nos 2 années de formation à l'école de théâtre internationale LASSAAD à Bruxelles. C'est une formation qui se découpe  en deux années dans lesquelles nous explorons diverses formes théâtrales ( Commedia dell'arte, pantomime, bouffon, clown tragédie...) , tout en gardant le mouvement comme base. <br/><p><br/></p>
<p>A la fin de la première année, nous étions tous les deux très motivés pour monter un projet en duo, alors nous avons profité des vacances d'été<br/>pour réaliser un spectacle de théâtre muet, <i>Mots sans dire</i>, et c'est naturellement que nous avons créer notre compagnie : Le Théâtr'o'QG.<br/>En restant sur la dynamique de l'école ( qui consistait à créer des petits ""spectacles"" toutes les semaines ), nous avons créer le notre et l'avons fait tourner dans plusieurs régions françaises. Dans les rues, ou chez des particuliers, nous cherchions un maximum d'occasion pour jouer notre spectacle. Et une fois rentrés à Bruxelles en septembre,  nous avons profiter du temps qui nous restait avant notre rentrée pour le présenter dans quelques festivals belges [ <i>La fête de l’Équinoxe</i> au château de Fisenne, et à <i>Murmurez Frénétique </i>à Bruxelles ]. Nous avons aussi été programmé dans un théâtre [ <i>Les MicroFactures</i> à Bruxelles ] !<br/></p>
<p><b>Et par la suite, qu'est ce que vous comptez faire ?</b></p>
<p>Notre idée c'est que nous fassions du Théâtr'o'QG une compagnie de théâtre muet itinérante. Nous voulons parcourir le monde et lui raconter des histoires uniquement au travers de nos mouvements et gestes.</p>
<p>L'avantage du muet, et que nous sommes ""universel"", nous utilisons un langage que tout le monde comprend, celui du corps, de cette manière nous supprimons la barrière de la langue.</p>
<p><b>Et donc, vous avez besoin de mon aide pour...?</b></p>
<p>Eh bien ... pour présenter notre spectacle aux Etats-Unis, à Chicago   !</p>
<p>Un de nos amis, étudiant à l'école LASSAAD , nous a invité à venir présenter notre travail chez lui. Le fait est, qu'un si grand voyage au sortir d'une école n'est pas évident à assumer financièrement.</p>
<p>Vos dons nous permettrons de bien nous lancer dans ce voyage, et de partir sur de bonnes bases pour cette compagnie
naissante.
</p>
<p>Cela nous aidera notamment dans l'achat des tickets d'avion pour nous rendre là-bas, et des frais qu'implique un voyage ( passeport, VISA, valises, logement une fois sur place, nourriture..)</p>
<p> Nous pourrons aussi investir dans du matériel de décors, des costumes &amp; des appareils techniques pour nos futures représentations. Votre aide nous aidera également à financer les droits d'auteurs de certaines musiques que nous utilisons pendant notre spectacle.<br/></p>

<p><b>SUPPORT ANDRÉ
WITH IS NEW PIECE ""LAY STILL, IT'S (NOT) OVER""</b><br/><span><br/>I'm a
Performer and Visual Artist from Lisbon, Portugal, currently living/ studying/
working in Berlin, Germany.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I just completed the 1st Semester of a
prestigious Master of Arts program called SODA (Solo/Dance/Authorship) at
UDK-HZT, where I've been busy integrating my previous experience as a visual
artist into a dance/performance context.<br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
During the 1st Semester, I've been receiving loads of input from artists, academics,
and theorists and
I've find myself confronted with many questions surrounding existing notions of
art, issues in-forming the visual and performative body, object,
functionality and the political/economical status (of an artist) in the
nowadays society. <br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span><br/>The Semester was fulfilled
with lectures and Intensive Workshops from/with:<br/></span></span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
Boyan Manchev, Helmut Ploebst, Noémie Solomon, Frédéric Neyrat (Theory of Twilight Imagination), Isabel Lang, Helmut Ploebst, Litó Walkey (Writing and Research); Sophia
New (Performative Writing); Eva Meyer Keller (Creating New Work); Constanze
Schellow (The Evil eye of an auditory) and Nik Haffner.</span></p>
<p>
Since July 20, I've been working on ""Lay still, it's (not) over"" and
now I'm out to you to support me and get me through the next steps to continue
this work. In October I will present ""Lay Still, It's (not)
over"", in HZT, Uferstudios, Berlin. <span><br/></span><br/></p>
<p><br/><b>DESCRIBING THE
PROJECT</b> <br/>This
project intends to investigate the use of the body in visual writing
formulas, establishing relations to action or suspension, being the main focus
increasingly on the notions of sharing between performer/audience as well
the space created for that (shared) situation to happen. I've been
interested in creating a space that makes possible a sharing moment - a space
where transformation happens in the eyes of an audience. <br/><br/>
""Lay still, it's (not) over"" could be a celebration about the
impermanence of life. A ""solo"" celebration of being here trapped
trying to escape from one’s own ""fugue"" - trying to escape from an
idea that soon everything will vanish with our bodies. <br/><br/>
I've been working obsessively with one object (party hats) but I'm not just
interested in the object-meaning, but also in is materiality and conic
form that resembles an idea of sharpness and openness, as if the
little edge would project to the infinity and at the same time and
opposite, would reduce it to nothing. I intend to create on stage
sculptures that tend to transform themselves in installations that will get inhabit. <br/><br/>
A reflection upon a way society as trying to mirror and reducing an
existence to consumption, creating an anxiety of wanting to produce more and
more, to be more and more. The media sets up the ""perfect"" space for
images / perspectives to clash, but creates a big gap between bi-dimension/three-dimension
images/emotions. The relationship between audience/performer, and in an
exhaustive “peeled onion” - public/private, individual/collective, visible/invisible,
context/perspective become the core of this work embedded with
thoughts and doubts.<br/><br/>
Our way of thinking sometimes can be very simple, while
our experience is always extremely complex. <br/><br/><br/><b>
BUSY<br/></b>... working obsessively with an object<br/>
... with transformation<br/>
... putting languages together<br/>
... with the overload of images<br/>
... trying to be in the present<br/>
... trying not to do everything at the same time<br/>
... trying to share</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span><b><br/><br/>RAISING THE
MONEY!</b></span><br/>
With your money I will be able to support the research period and the creation
of this new piece. I need your private support to help me reach my
goals. This means that I need to raise 1.000€ for the whole project.</p>
<p><br/>
The funds will be used: <br/><br/>
- for the production of the piece ""Lay Still, It's (not) over"": 200€<br/>
- for materials (props/objects) + costumes + set design: 250€<br/>
- for research materials (books, copies, etc.): 150€<br/>
- for collaborators: 200€<br/>
- for the production of the video: 200€<br/><br/>
The amount covers the period of research from July 20 till October 11 + presentation.<br/></p>
<p><b>Important note about the transfer:</b> don't get shocked if you don't see my name on the paypal account! Because I don't own a credit card I can't verify the paypal account - so I'm using my brother's paypal account! <span><br/></span>Don't get confused! It's just about the ""logistic"".</p>
<p><span><b><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>THE IMPACT</b><span><br/></span></span>Your
contribution will be very important in this critical point of my development as
an artist and thinker. I will be very grateful to know that I have private
people supporting me and who believe in my work - sharing my own perspective
about the world and in a way to explore other possibilities of behave towards
the world.</p>
<p>
There is also some works on the Gallery Tab above, or you can also find
more of my work on my website: <a href=""http://www.andreuerba.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.andreuerba.com</a></p>
<p>
If for any reasons you will not be able to come and see my Performance, I will
share some images and a short version of the Piece. The workbook will be
available online after October.<br/><br/>
During the campaign period I will update the current information and upload new
material on the Gallery. I've put details below so you can read more about my
work.</p>
<p><b><br/><br/>ABOUT MY WORK</b><br/>
I consider that my work is always in between visual arts and performing arts,
dissolving its borders and regarding the relation with a spectator or an
audience. I’ve been focusing my research and interest on moving and still image
(bi or three-dimensional image) as most of my projects start with a
""mental"" image that represents something I observed/experienced in
relation to other's body. <br/><br/>
The body in relation with its environment is the main matter. In this
way, I use performance to write visual formulae with the body, always
looking for a way to elicit emotion - and so my work becomes, in part, an
unconditional account of my reactions to death, physicality, sexuality,
society, politics, relationships and my own perspective and relation with the
world, an inhabiting body living in all these different layers of perception
and time in the society context. <br/><br/>
I do not consider my work documentary because I believe that reality is a
creation of a collective (and individual) consciousness through sharing and
that everyday existence is an illusory veil hiding us from the reality where we
truly dwell – the reality as a fiction “stage” – where the spectator is
retraced and implied. <br/><br/>
Everything created (""on stage"") reflects a personal experience
initiated/trigger by other's body. Everything created is, in this way
""dedicated"" to someone, directed to one single person that did
trigger my way of thinking/feeling somehow. I turn than into ""just"" a
channel that makes things flow to the outside world, after the observation
and/or trigger takes place.</p>
<p>The
""idea"" of something used to ""decorate"" a space (beautify)
as been following me for a while, perhaps a counter reaction to the way media
mediate images and ""messages"" nowadays. There is always something
hidden behind that ""decoration"", there is always a life there, always
a secret not revealed. I wish to ""collect"" moments and not

When I start a project I’m droned by intuition through places without knowing
the ""terminal"" station. So, my concerns while creating are also in a
matter related to time and projections. I discover what I want through doing. I
call projections to those things that don’t exist in the present but that could
exist in the near future – a vehicle to imagination.

WITH IS NEW PIECE ""LAY STILL, IT'S (NOT) OVER""I'm a
Performer and Visual Artist from Lisbon, Portugal, currently living/ studying/
working in Berlin, Germany.
I just completed the 1st Semester of a
prestigious Master of Arts program called SODA (Solo/Dance/Authorship) at
UDK-HZT, where I've been busy integrating my previous experience as a visual
artist into a dance/performance context.
During the 1st Semester, I've been receiving loads of input from artists, academics,
and theorists and
I've find myself confronted with many questions surrounding existing notions of
art, issues in-forming the visual and performative body, object,
functionality and the political/economical status (of an artist) in the
nowadays society. The Semester was fulfilled
with lectures and Intensive Workshops from/with:
Boyan Manchev, Helmut Ploebst, Noémie Solomon, Frédéric Neyrat (Theory of Twilight Imagination), Isabel Lang, Helmut Ploebst, Litó Walkey (Writing and Research); Sophia
New (Performative Writing); Eva Meyer Keller (Creating New Work); Constanze
Schellow (The Evil eye of an auditory) and Nik Haffner.

Since July 20, I've been working on ""Lay still, it's (not) over"" and
now I'm out to you to support me and get me through the next steps to continue
this work. In October I will present ""Lay Still, It's (not)
over"", in HZT, Uferstudios, Berlin. 
DESCRIBING THE
PROJECT This
project intends to investigate the use of the body in visual writing
formulas, establishing relations to action or suspension, being the main focus
increasingly on the notions of sharing between performer/audience as well
the space created for that (shared) situation to happen. I've been
interested in creating a space that makes possible a sharing moment - a space
where transformation happens in the eyes of an audience. 
""Lay still, it's (not) over"" could be a celebration about the
impermanence of life. A ""solo"" celebration of being here trapped
trying to escape from one’s own ""fugue"" - trying to escape from an
idea that soon everything will vanish with our bodies. 
I've been working obsessively with one object (party hats) but I'm not just
interested in the object-meaning, but also in is materiality and conic
form that resembles an idea of sharpness and openness, as if the
little edge would project to the infinity and at the same time and
opposite, would reduce it to nothing. I intend to create on stage
sculptures that tend to transform themselves in installations that will get inhabit. 
A reflection upon a way society as trying to mirror and reducing an
existence to consumption, creating an anxiety of wanting to produce more and
more, to be more and more. The media sets up the ""perfect"" space for
images / perspectives to clash, but creates a big gap between bi-dimension/three-dimension
images/emotions. The relationship between audience/performer, and in an
exhaustive “peeled onion” - public/private, individual/collective, visible/invisible,
context/perspective become the core of this work embedded with
thoughts and doubts.
Our way of thinking sometimes can be very simple, while
our experience is always extremely complex. 
BUSY... working obsessively with an object
... with transformation
... putting languages together
... with the overload of images
... trying to be in the present
... trying not to do everything at the same time
... trying to share


RAISING THE
MONEY!
With your money I will be able to support the research period and the creation
of this new piece. I need your private support to help me reach my
goals. This means that I need to raise 1.000€ for the whole project.

The funds will be used: 
- for the production of the piece ""Lay Still, It's (not) over"": 200€
- for materials (props/objects) + costumes + set design: 250€
- for research materials (books, copies, etc.): 150€
- for collaborators: 200€
- for the production of the video: 200€
The amount covers the period of research from July 20 till October 11 + presentation.
Important note about the transfer: don't get shocked if you don't see my name on the paypal account! Because I don't own a credit card I can't verify the paypal account - so I'm using my brother's paypal account! Don't get confused! It's just about the ""logistic"".
THE IMPACTYour
contribution will be very important in this critical point of my development as
an artist and thinker. I will be very grateful to know that I have private
people supporting me and who believe in my work - sharing my own perspective
about the world and in a way to explore other possibilities of behave towards
the world.

There is also some works on the Gallery Tab above, or you can also find
more of my work on my website: www.andreuerba.com

If for any reasons you will not be able to come and see my Performance, I will
share some images and a short version of the Piece. The workbook will be
available online after October.
During the campaign period I will update the current information and upload new
material on the Gallery. I've put details below so you can read more about my
work.
ABOUT MY WORK
I consider that my work is always in between visual arts and performing arts,
dissolving its borders and regarding the relation with a spectator or an
audience. I’ve been focusing my research and interest on moving and still image
(bi or three-dimensional image) as most of my projects start with a
""mental"" image that represents something I observed/experienced in
relation to other's body. 
The body in relation with its environment is the main matter. In this
way, I use performance to write visual formulae with the body, always
looking for a way to elicit emotion - and so my work becomes, in part, an
unconditional account of my reactions to death, physicality, sexuality,
society, politics, relationships and my own perspective and relation with the
world, an inhabiting body living in all these different layers of perception
and time in the society context. 
I do not consider my work documentary because I believe that reality is a
creation of a collective (and individual) consciousness through sharing and
that everyday existence is an illusory veil hiding us from the reality where we
truly dwell – the reality as a fiction “stage” – where the spectator is
retraced and implied. 
Everything created (""on stage"") reflects a personal experience
initiated/trigger by other's body. Everything created is, in this way
""dedicated"" to someone, directed to one single person that did
trigger my way of thinking/feeling somehow. I turn than into ""just"" a
channel that makes things flow to the outside world, after the observation
and/or trigger takes place.
The
""idea"" of something used to ""decorate"" a space (beautify)
as been following me for a while, perhaps a counter reaction to the way media
mediate images and ""messages"" nowadays. There is always something
hidden behind that ""decoration"", there is always a life there, always
a secret not revealed. I wish to ""collect"" moments and not
objects. 

When I start a project I’m droned by intuition through places without knowing
the ""terminal"" station. So, my concerns while creating are also in a
matter related to time and projections. I discover what I want through doing. I
call projections to those things that don’t exist in the present but that could
exist in the near future – a vehicle to imagination. 


In the
process of showing something to an audience, the singular word becomes plural,
because the audience (singular word) is composed by many individual people.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are approaching this project in four phases. Extra funds from a phase will be rolled into the next phase.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Phase one: Start CDL training two drivers for the bendy bus. Bacon (Josh) and Sissy B. (Nick P.) are hoping to become the drivers for the bus. With two drivers the bus will hopefully be available more often. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Phase two: Now that we have drivers in training lets get the bus legit. The Bus will needs to have insurance. It currently has valid plates until January and hopefully the bus will be supporting itself by time that it needs new plates.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Phase three: Time to give the bus some mechanical touch-up. A new windshield wiper motor, oil change, and filter change.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Phase four: The big finish! The final push to add the interior, sound system, and get her party ready! </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Phase one will not only help the drivers of the bus not fear the long arm of the law for driving a 50,000 lbs bus with air-brakes without the proper papers but it will open new door for the drivers themselves. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Sissy B./Nick is currently a straight truck driver for an outdoor company and the addition of a CDL will give him the chance to move up to driving larger trucks. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Temporary license $65.00 each = $130.00</p>
<p>DOT medical exam 50.00 each = $100.00</p>
<p>CDL instruction $1500.00 each = $3000.00</p>
<p>Road test $220.00 each = $440.00 </p>
<p>IndieGOGO fee at 9% = 330.30</p>
<p>Credit card fees at 3% = 120.01</p>

<br/><p>My name is Andy Parker and I have been working professionally as a self-employed artist for over ten years. Mainly, I consider myself a landscape painter, although that can stretch to cover quite a wide area these days - but generally it requires me traveling to paint and draw outdoors, around the country and further afield.</p>
<p>JMW Turner's series of paintings known as the <i>Ports and Harbours of England</i>, and the resultant prints, did more to establish his name in the minds of the general public than anything he'd painted previously and provide an indelible snapshot of the people, ports and places he visited.</p>My project, <i>In the Footsteps of Turner</i>, will be to follow behind to see what remains, what has changed and what has stayed the same in the two centuries since Turner set out - inspired by the painting and drawings of Turner's trip.  <br/><br/>The project is important to me for several reasons - principally, I believe that it is time for us to look at Turner's legacy and influence once again. Art schools and critics have praised him and then dismissed him, as fashions change, yet he remains one of the country's greatest painters. <br/><br/>From his earliest work, producing scenic landmarks for replication by engravers, through the majestic seas and skies he painted as he traveled, to the epic and dynamic, abstract later works - Turner's pictures have provided artists from all areas with continued inspiration, myself included. <br/><br/>In addition, as well as both working extensively outdoors we also share a common birthplace in London's Covent Garden - having been exposed to his work locally from my earliest times, this project finally allows me to properly acknowledge that formative influence.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/962340/files/20141027040419-BrightonStorm_16x20_x.JPG?1414407859"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <i>Brighton Storm </i>(16x20"") Oil on Canvas <br/><br/><p>It's quite an epic journey. Most of my regular painting involves riding from London and then painting in one place, for a week or two. <i>In the Footsteps of Turner</i> requires a much more systematic approach, where I travel to each area chronologically - starting in Yorkshire and working around the coastline in a clockwise direction, to finish in Falmouth, Cornwall.  <br/></p>
<p>I estimate that it will be well over 1000 miles of road from start to finish. The 15 locations I will visit should provide me with at least 30 paintings on canvas, as well as a number of painted works on panel and drawings. <br/></p>
<p>Posting updates and video clips as I travel, will allow people to follow my progress and experience the locations as I visit.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/965209/files/20141028034151-HarbourFogHastings_6x8_x.jpg?1414492911"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>Harbour Fog - Hastings</i> (6x8"") Oil on panel<br/><br/>The sum I am asking for is £10k in total. This will allow me to undertake the trip in the most compact manner - in can't cover every expense that can occur, but it will allow me to sleep 
indoors at night, work outdoors in all weathers in clothing that doesn't
 leak, maintain my vehicle and cover my living expenses while
 I am on the road - with the security of some contingency, should the unexpected happen. Vehicle maintenance becomes especially important when
 traveling this way, unlike my normal shorter, point-to-point painting 
trips. <br/><p><br/></p>
<p>The budget will also allow me buy a camera and laptop, to upload video images as I travel. These will be posted on a dedicated website and will go to producing a short DVD of the trip once the dust has settled. I will also be able to engage an assistant with marketing experience, to help me co-ordinate these activities.<br/></p>
<p>After the road trip is finished, following a short break, the studio work begins. This is  where I can complete the initial paintings, and then assess and produce further work from studies made on the road. It will also allow me to start on the framing and mounting of works for the exhibition, cover the hiring of a suitable venue and the marketing and presentation of the show. <br/></p>

The Exhibition will be where people can finally get to see what I have achieved! Contributors, of course, will already have some idea of how its all been going by the regular updates and mail-outs sent out to record my progress..<br/><br/><p>As well as keeping you informed about my progress, all Contributors will receive a personal thank-you letter from me and an invite to the Private View of the Exhibition in London.</p>
<p>As a reward for supporting my efforts financially, Contributors will also be able to have some excellent perks to choose from: including specially-created limited edition wood-cut prints, drawings and paintings, both panels sketches and larger works - these latter ones can be chosen after the trip is completed or from my existing landscape and seascape paintings, should you not want to wait that long!<br/></p>Should the appeal not reach its full target, then the project will start with the money raised so far, if it exceeds £2000 - this will allow me to get underway on the road, but will mean that I have to work more piecemeal on location, over a longer period,  and it will delay the final phase of framing, marketing and exhibiting until finances permit. <br/><br/><i>In The Footsteps of Turner</i> is an important project for me and it will happen. Your generosity will allow me to stay focused and bring all it about within a practical timeframe.<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/962381/files/20141027042448-DuckDayAfternoon_6x8_x.jpg?1414409088"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>Duck Day Afternoon - London</i> (6x8"") Oil on board<br/><br/><p>JMW Turner set out to depict his life and times and I hope to do the same. By contributing to my trip, your help will enable me to create a lasting body of work and show others how the influence of this great artist has echoed down the centuries.</p>
<p>All the locations he visited are still ports and harbours, but fortunes turn like 
the tides and I want to encourage people to remember just how 
influential and important their maritime heritage is - the power of this country was established by its maritime trade.</p>
<p>Turner's views were painted looking back towards the shore - this 
often being the first, and sometimes last, sight of land for the people on 
ships - and as much as anything the paintings concern the weather and 
the skies, the drama and the light, as they do the actual ports. I want 
 to see the world that Turner saw and discover the 
similarities that still exist since his day and to provide my contemporary contribution to 
maritime art, inspired by him.</p>My intention is to create this body of work as a contemporary update to the original series. By doing so, <i>In The Footsteps of Turner</i> will not only raise my profile and provide me with a new audience, but help to keep the work of England's greatest painter in the public consciousness, where it rightly belongs...<br/><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>

My name is Andy Parker and I have been working professionally as a self-employed artist for over ten years. Mainly, I consider myself a landscape painter, although that can stretch to cover quite a wide area these days - but generally it requires me traveling to paint and draw outdoors, around the country and further afield.
JMW Turner's series of paintings known as the Ports and Harbours of England, and the resultant prints, did more to establish his name in the minds of the general public than anything he'd painted previously and provide an indelible snapshot of the people, ports and places he visited.My project, In the Footsteps of Turner, will be to follow behind to see what remains, what has changed and what has stayed the same in the two centuries since Turner set out - inspired by the painting and drawings of Turner's trip.  The project is important to me for several reasons - principally, I believe that it is time for us to look at Turner's legacy and influence once again. Art schools and critics have praised him and then dismissed him, as fashions change, yet he remains one of the country's greatest painters. From his earliest work, producing scenic landmarks for replication by engravers, through the majestic seas and skies he painted as he traveled, to the epic and dynamic, abstract later works - Turner's pictures have provided artists from all areas with continued inspiration, myself included. In addition, as well as both working extensively outdoors we also share a common birthplace in London's Covent Garden - having been exposed to his work locally from my earliest times, this project finally allows me to properly acknowledge that formative influence. Brighton Storm (16x20"") Oil on Canvas It's quite an epic journey. Most of my regular painting involves riding from London and then painting in one place, for a week or two. In the Footsteps of Turner requires a much more systematic approach, where I travel to each area chronologically - starting in Yorkshire and working around the coastline in a clockwise direction, to finish in Falmouth, Cornwall.  
I estimate that it will be well over 1000 miles of road from start to finish. The 15 locations I will visit should provide me with at least 30 paintings on canvas, as well as a number of painted works on panel and drawings. 
Posting updates and video clips as I travel, will allow people to follow my progress and experience the locations as I visit.



Harbour Fog - Hastings (6x8"") Oil on panelThe sum I am asking for is £10k in total. This will allow me to undertake the trip in the most compact manner - in can't cover every expense that can occur, but it will allow me to sleep 
indoors at night, work outdoors in all weathers in clothing that doesn't
 leak, maintain my vehicle and cover my living expenses while
 I am on the road - with the security of some contingency, should the unexpected happen. Vehicle maintenance becomes especially important when
 traveling this way, unlike my normal shorter, point-to-point painting 
trips. 
The budget will also allow me buy a camera and laptop, to upload video images as I travel. These will be posted on a dedicated website and will go to producing a short DVD of the trip once the dust has settled. I will also be able to engage an assistant with marketing experience, to help me co-ordinate these activities.
After the road trip is finished, following a short break, the studio work begins. This is  where I can complete the initial paintings, and then assess and produce further work from studies made on the road. It will also allow me to start on the framing and mounting of works for the exhibition, cover the hiring of a suitable venue and the marketing and presentation of the show.

The Exhibition will be where people can finally get to see what I have achieved! Contributors, of course, will already have some idea of how its all been going by the regular updates and mail-outs sent out to record my progress..As well as keeping you informed about my progress, all Contributors will receive a personal thank-you letter from me and an invite to the Private View of the Exhibition in London.
As a reward for supporting my efforts financially, Contributors will also be able to have some excellent perks to choose from: including specially-created limited edition wood-cut prints, drawings and paintings, both panels sketches and larger works - these latter ones can be chosen after the trip is completed or from my existing landscape and seascape paintings, should you not want to wait that long!Should the appeal not reach its full target, then the project will start with the money raised so far, if it exceeds £2000 - this will allow me to get underway on the road, but will mean that I have to work more piecemeal on location, over a longer period,  and it will delay the final phase of framing, marketing and exhibiting until finances permit. In The Footsteps of Turner is an important project for me and it will happen. Your generosity will allow me to stay focused and bring all it about within a practical timeframe.
Duck Day Afternoon - London (6x8"") Oil on boardJMW Turner set out to depict his life and times and I hope to do the same. By contributing to my trip, your help will enable me to create a lasting body of work and show others how the influence of this great artist has echoed down the centuries.
All the locations he visited are still ports and harbours, but fortunes turn like 
the tides and I want to encourage people to remember just how 
influential and important their maritime heritage is - the power of this country was established by its maritime trade.
Turner's views were painted looking back towards the shore - this 
often being the first, and sometimes last, sight of land for the people on 
ships - and as much as anything the paintings concern the weather and 
the skies, the drama and the light, as they do the actual ports. I want 
 to see the world that Turner saw and discover the 
similarities that still exist since his day and to provide my contemporary contribution to 
maritime art, inspired by him.My intention is to create this body of work as a contemporary update to the original series. By doing so, In The Footsteps of Turner will not only raise my profile and provide me with a new audience, but help to keep the work of England's greatest painter in the public consciousness, where it rightly belongs...
