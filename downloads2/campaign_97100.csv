<h2>Do you believe?</h2>
<p>Do you believe in aliens? I have seen television shows, movies, and news articles about aliens and UFO's and believe human beings have an inherent fascination with extraterrestrials. I am one of those people and believe that we are not alone. There is a lot of historical evidence that suggests this may be fact. What do you believe? Has alien technology assisted us to develop so quickly as a civilization? What if there is alien technology available, but the governments of the world have covered it up?  Maybe they discovered an unlimited power source, but they are unable to stabilize it because of lack of knowledge or fear of the unknown. This power source could revolutionize the world and bring us one step closer to unlimited power, a pollution-free planet, and an understanding of worlds beyond our own.  </p>
<p>I had a vision a few years ago about writing a fictional book about a bizarre steampunk carnival powered by ancient alien technology. The book will appeal to all sci-fi and steampunk fans with its unique and colorful characters. The characters are dreamt from my imagination which all tell their own story. Each character has their own personality with special abilities, skills, and desires and they have the choice to enhance themselves at a mortal price. Most of the characters wear steampunk-like gadgetry which is not powered by steam, but with a smart alien power source called Lodscovium. The technology is unstable and produces a toxic mist which is deadly overtime without protection.</p>
<h3>The Limited Edition Playing Cards</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535976106/vpuzk6va9b33io2kabei.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Tuck Boxes Trio</i></p>
<p>Before I release my book, I have brought my characters to life with playing cards for all to enjoy. These playing cards are limited edition and only 1000 decks will be printed!  This deck is the first deck of a 3-part series.  The future decks of this series will expand to include other incredible characters within Llod's Carnival and its origins. </p>
<p>The playing cards contained in the first series are high-quality illustrations of some of the main characters in the Llod’s Carnival book. The characters are expertly designed to illustrate their special steampunk devices that enhance their natural innate abilities. However, they may pay the ultimate price for exploiting the technology without fully understanding the ramifications. The bottom pose of each character demonstrates the potential outcome if they decide to overuse and abuse the technology. The character transforms into a ghastly and dying image of their former self from the toxic alien radiation which emanates from their steampunk gadgets.</p>

<h3>Symbolism</h3>
<p>Each playing card will contain symbolic references. You will need to look closely and examine each character to draw your own conclusion of what you think it means. To find out more about each character and symbolic references, go to <a href=""http://www.conethgames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.conethgames.com</a>. </p>

<p>There are two types of pips. One type is located in the corners of the face cards and the other type are on the numerical face cards. </p>
<p>The corner pips of each suit are detailed to include symbolic meanings from ancient Egyptian times.  The spades use the scorpion which is to honor of the Egyptian goddess Isis. The diamonds suit is represented by a cobra which is often depicted spitting fire.  The suit of clubs represents the cycle of life with the sacred scarab beetle.  Lastly, the bee is synonymous with the heart suit and represents part of the title of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt.</p>

<p>The numerical face card pips are clean, with elegant line art which represents a nostalgic period of time. The design follows the same theme as the characters when they are exposed to Lodscovium radiation. The upper part of the card will always display as normal pips. However, the bottom pips are deteriorated and broken up. This design is used on each number of every suit to maintain consistency. </p>
<h3>Tuck Box </h3>

<p>The tuck box is visual eye candy that brings your eyes front and center. The beautiful Cassandra does not disappoint with her flowing hair, enchanting eyes, and a dress that she fills and expects your immediate attention. At the top, are highly detailed pips that are symbolic of ancient Egyptian times. </p>
<p>The backside of the tuck box is complemented with painterly scenery from Llod’s Carnival. The carnival can be seen in the distance with its famous star wheel amusement ride attraction. In the foreground, approaches Llod’s train with its signature winged horse engine which pulls the locomotive forward. The train engine spews out a trail of green toxic fumes that can be seen for miles and glows in the night sky. </p>
<p>On the side of the box, a nighttime scene evokes feelings of solitude with a floating balloon rising towards the heavens. Directly behind the balloon is Orion’s belt which illuminates the night sky in the distance. It’s believed that extraterrestrials come from that distant part of the sky. </p>
<p>The tuck box design is unique when placing 3 tuck boxes together. If you place the front, side, and back together, it will display a brilliant panoramic view.</p>

Who are we?
Spellcrow is a company from Poland with a
wide range of fantasy heroes and creatures as well as sci-fi range of bits. We
have years of experience in sculpting high quality miniatures in 28mm scale.
You can find our previous works at www.spellcrow.com or on our facebook.
We are building our range constantly – lately we have
released a bunch of big beasts. We have noticed that adding new miniatures to
our range needs much time and money. But we think that this process could be
speeded up with your help!



Some time ago we have released Helloween Mage
miniature – our first representative of our pumpkinhead race the Dyniaqs. It attracted great interest and lots of
people were sending us positive feedback. Next was Helloween Lord (the one on the right) who also was well received.



As the next halloween is coming we have an idea to
expand our line with new high quality miniatures and we want to release the set
of six pumpkinhead adventurers. They are going to depict the heroic fantasy
archetypes such as mage, barbarian and other characters you can find in any
fantasy RPG. Whether you are the collector, painter or gamer you should enjoy
those miniatures! The starter set will include new and the existing miniatures. 



Also as the campaign develops we are going to expand the range by new miniatures as you can see in the 'Strech goals' section. All miniatures will be cast in metal. All the models are supplied unassembled and comes with slot base. The rules for starter set will be released and available for download as are the main rules which you can find here.
 



We would like to release whole set at once. To do so we need your aid as the Indiegogo campaign will help us raise funds to start production process. It is probably the most cash consuming part of releasing new minis. Your pledges will help us start making molds and casting process. We are planning to release our miniatures box within 4 weeks after the campaign ends but we hope to do that sooner. Last but not least this is the great way to get feedback from you and much positive energy to keep up with our work!






As we are really grateful for your support we created
those cool perks for you! Depending on how much you would like to contribute
you can select the right one for you. Postage costs are not included in
the perks total so you will have to add +3 EUR so we can send yours miniatures to you. When picking multiple perks you pay shippng cost only once.


As the Seed Man you will receive high quality Halloween wallpaper and a big thank you on your e-mail.





As the Root Warrior you will receive one metal miniature of Dyniaq with a whip. Please add 3 EUR for shipping.











As the Leaf Master you will receive the Dyniaq mage miniature. Additionally you will receive the Dyniaq spawn for free! Please add 3 EUR for shipping.

</p></div>","Why did I take this Project to Indiegogo?
 After my 1st Successful run of these dice on Kickstarter I was planning on ""rolling"" the profits over into extra dice.  But ""Life"" happened and I was laid off from my full time job as a Mechanical Engineer.  Since Kickstarter doesn't allow you to re-run duplicate projects I decided to raise the funds here on Indiegogo to produce a 2nd run of these amazing dice.  
Does this project offer anything new from the 1st project?
Yes!!!  
I will now be offering these amazing dice in the lightweight yet strong material of ...
Titanium!








I will also be offering for the first time d6 dice with Numerals!



Anodized Aluminum, Steel, Brass, and Copper Solid Numeral Dice

Anodized Aluminum, Titanium, Brass, and Copper Floating Numeral Dice

What if I want more dice?
Indiegogo only lets you indicate one perk with your pledge, but you can still overpledge for additional dice now.  Once the campaign ends, the amount you overpledged will be converted into credit. I will be using Backerkit post-campaign to manage orders, credits, and add-ons.
You don't HAVE to overpledge now: you can wait until AFTER the campaign ends to add-on more dice via Backerkit (you will have to enter your credit card again).
When you are pledging and choosing your reward please choose the highest reward 1st then increase your pledge by the amount of the lower perk level(s) or by the amount shown in the Add-On Chart (below).
How do I select what Color(s), Type(s), and Style(s) of Dice that I want?After the Project is successful and has ended you will all receive invites to Backerkit.Backerkit is a post project system that will allow you to select the Color, Style, and Type of every dice that you order! You can also add more dice if you wish.
Precision Metal Dice!

<p>In the Stonebound Saga you and your opponent control a group of '<strong>Stonebound</strong>'; those from the world of Telios who have responded to the '<strong>Speaking Stones</strong>'. These Speaking Stones began humming and pulsing when the lost city of Lux reappeared after disappearing thousands of years ago. Those who respond to the stones and hone their power become known as Stonebound. These stones are equipped to their weapons and armor to enable feats of incredible power and skill unlike anything the world has seen.<br/><br/>Players pre-construct or draft teams of Stonebound who are training against each other in preparation for an impending battle against a force known as Tenebris.</p>

<p>The Stonebound Saga is a great mix of unit positioning and strategy requiring each player to carefully plan their turns and manage their resources to achieve victory against their opponent. The numerous and diverse characters allow for a variety of play styles, and every match is an unique experience.<br/><br/>Games can be played between 2 players, or with teams of 2 or 3. The first player, or team to defeat their opponent's Stonebound by bringing their HP to zero is the winner.</p>

</div></div>","Can you draw upon the power of the speaking stones, and prepare for the upcoming battle against Tenebris? Build your team to suit your strategy, and defeat your opponents in this skirmish style card game for 2-6 players!

 
The Stonebound Saga comes with:
1 25""X35"" Game board
147 Card Resource Deck in Tuckbox
140 Card Character Abilities Deck in Tuckbox
70 Character Cards
12 Character Dashboards with moving sliders
72 Wooden pegs
110 Status Effect tokens
2 Pair of D10 Dice
28 Card 'Expansion Sampler'
1 Rulebook

In the Stonebound Saga you and your opponent control a group of 'Stonebound'; those from the world of Telios who have responded to the 'Speaking Stones'. These Speaking Stones began humming and pulsing when the lost city of Lux reappeared after disappearing thousands of years ago. Those who respond to the stones and hone their power become known as Stonebound. These stones are equipped to their weapons and armor to enable feats of incredible power and skill unlike anything the world has seen.Players pre-construct or draft teams of Stonebound who are training against each other in preparation for an impending battle against a force known as Tenebris.

Players track their character's stats and abilities using dashboards with sliders to track dynamic stats and pegs to track activated abilities. Each Stonebound comes with two ability cards that are placed into each dashboard.

 
There are 70 unique characters for players to choose their teams from spanning 7 different character classes. Below you'll find descriptions and examples of Stonebound from each class.








 
 
 






Between all of the characters in The Stonebound Saga they have close to 300 unique abilities many of which can inflict various status effects. There are 11 different status effects to build your strategy around!

Each character comes with two ability cards based from the elements of speaking stones equipped to their weapons and armor. The bottom left corner of each character card indicates which element of speaking stones are for offensive abilities, and the bottom right corner for defensive abilities.

 

 
The game is played on a large grid-based gameboard spanning 25"" X 35"". On each player's turn they will strategically move their characters across the battlefield to outwit and overwhelm their opponents. 

 
Throughout the game, players will use speaking stone cards drawn from a community resource deck in order to perform various abilities in battle. Players will need to manage their resources effectively by choosing when to use their resources for offense or dedicate resources for passive defensive abilities that count against their hand size.

 

The Stonebound Saga is a great mix of unit positioning and strategy requiring each player to carefully plan their turns and manage their resources to achieve victory against their opponent. The numerous and diverse characters allow for a variety of play styles, and every match is an unique experience.Games can be played between 2 players, or with teams of 2 or 3. The first player, or team to defeat their opponent's Stonebound by bringing their HP to zero is the winner.

<p>Assembling your escape ship <strong>requires both skill and willingness to push your luck</strong> if you have any chance of escaping. Working alone or with your friend, you must <strong>use your time and commands wisely</strong>, or else you will run out of time.</p>
<p><strong>Assembly is quick to learn, fast and eminently replayable</strong>; there’s plenty of variation for repeated attempts and the variable difficulty levels allows you to <strong>scale the game to suit you</strong>. </p>

<p>Assembly was <strong>designed with both solo and 2-player game modes in mind from the beginning</strong>. The only difference in gameplay is that secret information and (optional) <strong>communication limits are added into the mix for 2-players</strong>. You can even play entirely with hand gestures!</p>

<p>You must <strong>fully assemble the spaceship</strong> that lies in front of you in order to escape by <strong>locking each module into its correct bay</strong> before you can escape!  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the <strong>ship’s computer isn’t going to make your life easy</strong>, and just as you think you're a step ahead she'll throw a spanner in the works.  </p>

<h3>Glitches Expansion</h3>
<div><div>

<p>The Glitches add an extra dimension to Assembly; <strong>it gives the computer the ability to actively disrupt your escape attempts</strong>. This expansion will increase the replayability of Assembly and will ramp up the difficulty. This expansion also includes <strong>4 new Malfunction sets and 1 new Role card</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>But what are Glitches?</strong></p>
<p>With the Glitches expansion, when you refresh the Command deck, you must add a Glitch card to it as well as one of the set-aside Command cards. <strong>Glitch cards allow you to chose their outcome</strong>, between two undesirable effects of course! When you draw a Glitch card, you must resolve its effect immediately.</p>

<p>“Overall, I think Assembly is a lot of fun! If you’re looking for a fun solo puzzle, this is definitely it, but if you’re looking for a very strategic two-player cooperative puzzle, this will likely satisfy that part of your collective brain as well. I’d recommend at either player count. One thing that I particularly like is how clear and distinguishable the symbols on the Room Modules are so that players don’t have to rely on color (or their perception of color) to be able to effectively play the game. There are a lot of good design elements at play. I’m a fan.”  <a href=""https://whatsericplaying.com/2018/05/21/assembly"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read More.</a></p>

<p>We know shipping can be quite a contentious issue and we have thought long and hard about how to best meet the needs of our backers whilst also minimising our risk. We have therefore decided to use a pledge manager and charge shipping after the campaign and will be using a fulfilment partner to ship rewards. This allows us to to mitigate the risk of the highly variable shipping costs between different regions whilst also ensuring that you aren't negatively impacted by our estimates being off. See our FAQ for more info. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530571825/xq6iju6osridqjji3guf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>However, we know you want certainty; we know we would. Therefore we will be as open and transparent as we can with regards to shipping, which will be based on actual cost. See each of the individual pledge levels for shipping costs.</p>
<h3>Canada</h3>
<p>The Advanced Escape pledge level is Canada friendly, however if you plan to purchase additional copies, the play mat or T-shirt, please contact us so we can let you know if your pledge will remain Canada friendly. See our FAQ or contact us for more details.</p>
<h3>Retailers</h3>
<p>Please message us if you are interested in purchasing multiple copies for your shop and we'll let you know how you can buy (crate size 12). </p>
<p><i>Note: Only the Assembly base game will be available at retail.</i></p>

<p>Still not sure whether to back Assembly? Then read on!</p>
<p>Assembly was originally designed as a <strong>BGG Mint Tin Design Contest</strong> entry in 2016 where it <strong>came 3rd out of 26 entries </strong>for the <strong>Most Innovative Mechanic</strong>. Since then, we have been refining the gameplay as well as adding extra content to maximise replayability. </p>
<p>But why should you help us make Assembly a reality?</p>
<h3>Quick &amp; Easy to Learn</h3>
<p><strong>We've kept things as simple, intuitive and thematic in Assembly.</strong> Additionally, key rules are included on player aids so you won’t have to refer to the rule book mid-game (one of our pet hates)! </p>
<h3>Plays Equally Well at Both Player Counts</h3>
<p>Whether you are a solo gamer or a cooperative gamer, <strong>Assembly has been iteratively refined and tested at both player counts</strong>. We believe the solo experience should be as good as those at higher player counts (minus the player interactions!) and vice versa.</p>
<h3>Replay Value</h3>
<p>Assembly at its heart is a thematic puzzle and by its nature <strong>every puzzle will be slightly different</strong>. There are also multiple ways to scale the difficulty both up and down. Finally, there are mini-expansions in the form of Malfunctions. These change the parameters of the puzzle, influencing your win strategy. And if you want even more replay value, add the Glitches expansion to your pledge!</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Wren games is a wife and husband team based in the UK.  We first got into tabletop gaming over 5 years ago with Pandemic being the game that got us hooked. We are also avid Kickstarter supporters and our games collection is almost exclusive coop/solo games as these are our passion.</p>
<p>We first started designing games over 2 years ago when Janice was on maternity leave with our eldest daughter, Amelie. Assembly is our first game on Kickstarter so you have every right to be suspicious of us as a new publisher but please read on to find out why we think we can do it and why you should trust us.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530572663/wgii5vat3vaiuzdepxne.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Janice</strong> is a frequent cooperative gamer and occasional solo gamer. She's the lead designer of Assembly, with Assembly being her second game design. Janice is also a <strong>qualified professional Project and Product Manager</strong> with most of her experience lying in high-tech, high value products. She's taken several products from an idea through to manufacture, including inventing her own technology as part of her PhD. Although board game manufacture is new to us, the process is not unfamiliar to Janice. As an added bonus, she is currently on maternity leave with our youngest daughter, Sammie, so doesn't have the distraction of work to get in the way (just the distraction of kids!). </p>
<p><strong>Stu</strong> is an ex-teacher turned software engineer. He got the family started on the hobby of collecting and playing modern boardgames and loves to paint minatures. Stu is also the <strong>big solo gamer</strong> amongst the two of us. He has pretty high standards for solo games and has extensively tested and helped to develop both the solo and 2-player variants for Assembly over the past 2 and a bit years. He also has a knack for attention for detail, so if you spot any mistakes, it's his fault ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Amelie</strong> is the eldest of our two daughters. She has a pretty decent dice and large meeple collection and loves 'reorganising' our game design bits and bobs. Already an avid gamer, her favourite games are Beasts of Balance and My First Orchard.</p>
<p><strong>Sammie</strong> is the newest arrival to Wren Games, she is currently undergoing indoctrination about loving boardgames by her older sister and we're sure she will also turn into a little gamer in the not too distant future. For now though, she much prefers chewing electrical cables.</p>
<p><strong>Inca</strong> the cat has shown little interest in board games. He doesn't even like boxes! Inca tends to keep to himself other than bringing us the occasional present of a (live) mouse or rat and then sitting and watching us try to catch it. He is however the star of one of our potential future games.</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
</div><div>
<p>So we're a new publisher, why should you trust us?</p>
<p><strong>Risk 1: Can We Do It? </strong><br/>Janice is an experience and qualified Project and Product Manager with over 10 years of industry experience (AMP-PQ / IPMA Level C). She has delivered multi-million pound high-tech projects on time and on budget. In comparison, this project is pretty small and she will be using her PM knowledge and expertise to manage it from kick-off to completion and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Risk 2: Manufacture - Quality </strong><br/>To reduce the risk of poor quality, incorrect components, etc. we have chosen to manufacture all elements of this project in Europe. This will ensure that not only the required safety standards are met but also with our manufacturers in (almost) the same time zone as us it will make communication much easier and more efficient. It also has the added bonus that we are supporting fairly paid workers and local/small businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Risk 3: Manufacture - On Time Delivery </strong><br/>The delivery date of this project is not based on a 'best case' scenario. We have provided what is a realistic timeline based upon certain risks occurring (such as being bumped in manufacture due to being a small publisher in the lead-up to Essen, national holidays, etc.). However, we will be working to, and driving our suppliers to the optimum delivery schedule. We want to be realistic with you about what our schedule could be and will keep you updated every step of the way.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Small Print</h2>
<p>We hope that shipping will go perfectly for everyone but there's always a small chance that it won't so here's what we will do about it:</p>
<p>Lost and returned shipments will only be resent once. If you do not receive them the second time we will instead offer you: </p>
<p>If we are at fault (i.e. lost shipment): A full refund of your pledge and shipping. </p>
<p>If you are at fault (i.e. wrong address, didn’t collect, etc.): A full refund (minus fees) of your pledge only. </p>
<p>We will reserve your pledge for 3 months from the date of receipt of games from our manufacturer or from the final call for address and shipping payments (this will be clearly labelled), whichever is later. If you have not provided us information/payment in order for us to ship your pledge to you: we will continue to attempt to contact you by all means available to us for 1 month after this deadline. After this point we will assume that you do not want your pledge and will put your pledge into our retail stock (storage costs us money!). However, if you contact us after this point and:</p>
<p>We have stock and receive shipping payment at the current rate, we will fulfil your pledge as ordered. </p>
<p>We can only fulfil part of your pledge, we will give you the offer of fulfilment of as much of your pledge as possible plus a refund of any items that we cannot fulfil (minus fees) OR a full refund (minus fees).</p>
<p>We do not have any stock, we will offer you a full refund (minus fees). -</p>
<p>Missing and/or damaged components will be shipped out to you free of charge. Components lost or damaged by you will be replaced (if we have stock) but will attract a small charge to cover our costs.</p>
<p>You will have have 12 months from the date of shipment to lodge any complaints or issues with regards to the goods being received.</p>

<p><strong>Mike Jessup</strong> is a good friend of Janice and Stu's. Mike by day is an engineer and by night an artist and gamer. The blueprint art that you see throughout Assembly is his work.</p>
<p>For most of the icons used, we are indebted to the wonderful resources provided by <strong>game-icons.net </strong>and thenounproject.org. They are some of the best online resources for game designers! </p>
<p>And finally, a huge thank-you to al our <strong>playtesters</strong> and <strong>previewers</strong> who have helped to bring some attention to the fact that Assembly exists. We will be forever grateful to you all :)</p>
</div></div>","Assembling your escape ship requires both skill and willingness to push your luck if you have any chance of escaping. Working alone or with your friend, you must use your time and commands wisely, or else you will run out of time.
Assembly is quick to learn, fast and eminently replayable; there’s plenty of variation for repeated attempts and the variable difficulty levels allows you to scale the game to suit you. 

Assembly was designed with both solo and 2-player game modes in mind from the beginning. The only difference in gameplay is that secret information and (optional) communication limits are added into the mix for 2-players. You can even play entirely with hand gestures!

Assembly has been created by indie publisher Wren Games, the wife and husband team Janice and Stu Turner. Short Summary

 


Note: Photos show handmade prototype components and mini-sized cards. The final version of Assembly will contain standard bridge-sized cards.

Note: Photos show handmade prototype components and mini-sized cards. The final version of Assembly will contain standard bridge-sized cards.

 
Glitches Expansion
Note: This expansion is only included at the 'Advanced Escape' pledge tier or higher.


 


You must fully assemble the spaceship that lies in front of you in order to escape by locking each module into its correct bay before you can escape!  
Working either alone or with a friend, you will take turns to manipulate the modules around the assembly line towards their correct bays. 
Unfortunately, the ship’s computer isn’t going to make your life easy, and just as you think you're a step ahead she'll throw a spanner in the works.  
There are multiple versions of the 2-player game allowing you to customise the game, ranging from simply not being able to reveal the cards in your hand, to playing in silence, only using hand gestures. 
Sounds easy? You might be in for a surprise!

Assembly's turn order is:

Choose a Command card to play;
Verify it (2-players only);
Execute your chosen command;
Apply any resultant effects;
Draw up to hand limit.

And there are just 4 commands to remember:

Watch How to Play the Solo version with Ricky Royal at Box of Delights.
Watch a Quick Overview with Janice at Wren Games (note: prototype components).
Playing with 2?

Watch How to Play the 2-player version with Rahdo Runs-Through.

Each time you need to refresh the Command deck (when you can't draw a card), you must first Scramble the Bay (Blueprint) cards. After scrambling, add one of the set-aside Command cards to the discard pile and shuffle the deck to create a new draw pile.

 
Glitches Expansion


The Glitches add an extra dimension to Assembly; it gives the computer the ability to actively disrupt your escape attempts. This expansion will increase the replayability of Assembly and will ramp up the difficulty. This expansion also includes 4 new Malfunction sets and 1 new Role card.
But what are Glitches?
With the Glitches expansion, when you refresh the Command deck, you must add a Glitch card to it as well as one of the set-aside Command cards. Glitch cards allow you to chose their outcome, between two undesirable effects of course! When you draw a Glitch card, you must resolve its effect immediately.


 



 


Add-ons are available in our pledge manager.

Multiple Copies
If you'd like to purchase more than 1 copy of Assembly, simply add them as an Extra in our pledge manager.
Premium Neoprene Play Mat, £20
2mm thick, 25x25 inch (635x635 mm)  neoprene play may.


T-Shirt, £19

 Note: Design, sizes and fit of the T-shirt are still being finalised.
Coasters, £4 for a set of 4
Note: Every backer at the Advanced Escape pledge level or higher will automatically get 1 of these coasters included with their reward.

Zinc Alloy Die, £4
The die shown in the graphic above is missing the coloured numbers because the factory add in the colour we choose. We have decided to ask them for a cream that will match the game so the final die will be a dark blue zinc alloy with cream numbers.


The best way to find out if you like a game is to play it. You can download and read the draft rules, play Assembly digitally or print it out and make your own copy. Just follow these links:

Draft Rules (Base Game)
Draft Rules (Glitches Expansion) 
Low Ink Print and Play 

Solo setup on Tabletopia 

2-player setup on Tabletopia 

Note: You do not need an account to play Assembly on Tabletopia. Due to setup limits, these versions do not include Malfunctions - if you want to try them, please download the PnP files.
We continue to welcome constructive feedback on Assembly. It's at least 95% complete but we're happy to make mods and tweaks if it'll make the game better. We want you to have the best possible game we can make.


“Loved the game; a fiendish puzzle that will delight any soloist looking for a compact quick challenge. It’s a game you can keep playing for its simple ruleset and quick play time. It’s a big thumbs up from me.” Watch it.
 
""[Assembly]’s a lovely little design. It’s a fun fast puzzle of a game that’s tight and compact and has a Hanabi feeling. It's a sharp, sweet, fun little coop game."" Watch it.

“Overall, I think Assembly is a lot of fun! If you’re looking for a fun solo puzzle, this is definitely it, but if you’re looking for a very strategic two-player cooperative puzzle, this will likely satisfy that part of your collective brain as well. I’d recommend at either player count. One thing that I particularly like is how clear and distinguishable the symbols on the Room Modules are so that players don’t have to rely on color (or their perception of color) to be able to effectively play the game. There are a lot of good design elements at play. I’m a fan.”  Read More.

""I highly recommend checking out the Kickstarter campaign as this is a game that I can honestly say I love everything about – the replayability; the wonderful quality of the wooden tokens; the gameplay; the exhilaration that comes with trying to beat the clock; learning to communicate differently and more effectively with my fellow players; literally everything!"" Read More.

We know shipping can be quite a contentious issue and we have thought long and hard about how to best meet the needs of our backers whilst also minimising our risk. We have therefore decided to use a pledge manager and charge shipping after the campaign and will be using a fulfilment partner to ship rewards. This allows us to to mitigate the risk of the highly variable shipping costs between different regions whilst also ensuring that you aren't negatively impacted by our estimates being off. See our FAQ for more info. 

However, we know you want certainty; we know we would. Therefore we will be as open and transparent as we can with regards to shipping, which will be based on actual cost. See each of the individual pledge levels for shipping costs.
Canada
The Advanced Escape pledge level is Canada friendly, however if you plan to purchase additional copies, the play mat or T-shirt, please contact us so we can let you know if your pledge will remain Canada friendly. See our FAQ or contact us for more details.
Retailers
Please message us if you are interested in purchasing multiple copies for your shop and we'll let you know how you can buy (crate size 12). 
Note: Only the Assembly base game will be available at retail.

Still not sure whether to back Assembly? Then read on!
Assembly was originally designed as a BGG Mint Tin Design Contest entry in 2016 where it came 3rd out of 26 entries for the Most Innovative Mechanic. Since then, we have been refining the gameplay as well as adding extra content to maximise replayability. 
But why should you help us make Assembly a reality?
Quick & Easy to Learn
We've kept things as simple, intuitive and thematic in Assembly. Additionally, key rules are included on player aids so you won’t have to refer to the rule book mid-game (one of our pet hates)! 
Plays Equally Well at Both Player Counts
Whether you are a solo gamer or a cooperative gamer, Assembly has been iteratively refined and tested at both player counts. We believe the solo experience should be as good as those at higher player counts (minus the player interactions!) and vice versa.
Replay Value
Assembly at its heart is a thematic puzzle and by its nature every puzzle will be slightly different. There are also multiple ways to scale the difficulty both up and down. Finally, there are mini-expansions in the form of Malfunctions. These change the parameters of the puzzle, influencing your win strategy. And if you want even more replay value, add the Glitches expansion to your pledge!

<p>At the last stage of the Everlasting Wet Palette development, we sent prototypes<b> to dozens of independent reviewers</b>. The <b>feedback has been overwhelmingly positive</b>, and we have also been able to incorporate a lot of suggestions from them into our design! But don't just take our word for it:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.redgrassgames.com/reviews.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">See reviews on our website !</a></p>
<p><b>SHOSHIES MINIS :</b> "" I will definitely buy one of those""  </p>
<p><b>SPIKEYBITS :</b> "" I will keep it on my desk""   </p>
<p><b>GEEKDAD :</b> ""you'll love the thought that has gone into the product and find it improves your painting experience too""  </p>
<p><b>NEXT LEVEL PAINTING :</b> ""I am not a wet palette guy, but I was pretty impressed!""  </p>
<p><b>MAGABOTATO </b>: "" Foam and paper works perfectly for me""</p>
<p><b>FIGUREMENTORS : </b>""I have been very impressed with the prototype and these could be the next BIG thing""</p>

<ul>
<li>Your paint dilution will stay stable during your painting session for hours. The paint will not bleed and will not dry. The perfect hydration will help you master the painting techniques like a pro. This cannot be reproduced without our paper and foam.</li>

<ul>
<li>Our foam holds a lot of water compared to its size ! The final foam will be thicker than the one used during reviews and reaches 3.5mm for <b>improved hydration</b> while retaining the same quality.</li>
<li>Our special foam is <b>naturally mold resistan</b>t. No anti-mold chemicals are added to the foam, and the effect will not wear out over time. So no bad smell after a few days, even when not stored in a fridge. Long lasting, you just need to rinse it from time to time with fresh water.</li>
<li>Our paper is the <b>perfect match</b> for our foam. It sticks on it, and does not create bubbles. <b>100% of the paper</b> is in contact with the foam, for <b>perfect hydration</b>. It will not curl after the easy setup. It was particularly selected to offer the <b>best performance with hobby paints</b> and level of dilution used in hobby painting.</li>
<li>Machine cut to exact dimensions, taking into account the swell effect due to the water contact</li>
<li>The overall color is <b>neutra</b>l, light gray, so that you can paint with ""<b>true colours""</b>

<p>We <b>designed Everlasting Wet Palette</b> with perfect dimensions :</p>
<ul>
<li>For easy access. </li>
<li>Low raise</li>
<li>Compact foot print.</li>
</ul>
<p>2 sizes are available to cater to different needs : </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Painter size,</b> 15 by 20 cm (5,9"" x 7,9""), made for miniature painters looking for a good sized palette, that is <b>compact and easy to carry.</b> It's perfect for small to medium sized paint stations. Painter Everlasting Wet Palette can be extended using the top lid as a side Palette.</li>
<li>
<b>Studio size</b>, 20 by 30 cm (7,9"" x 11,8""), made for Pros and Enthusiasts looking for a <b>huge painting area.</b> It's perfect for medium to large sized paint stations. Studio Everlasting Wet Palette can also be extended using the top lid as a side Palette.</li>
</ul>

<p>When we built Everlasting Wet Palette we decided to make it :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Airtight, and leak resistant</b>. We selected a TPE seal for its durability and so that it is easily operable.</li>
<li>Also, the hydration system is really stable and does not move during transport, as the <b>foam sticks to the case</b> naturally. </li>
<li>The provided strap also contributes to making Everlasting Wet Palette<b> a great palette to move around.</b> The strap selected will be durable, made of Polyamide.</li>
<li>Finally, we selected strong, <b>high quality ABS plastics </b>for its durability and stability.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Wavy</b> is the first magnet accessory available for Everlasting Wet Palette. We wanted to reinvent the way people use wells in miniature painting, by deciding on a compact size, but yet stable system thanks to the magnet. That way you can paint without fearing of hitting your wells and without consuming too much space for them. We then associated it with <b>a brush holder. </b></p>
<p><b>Wavy</b> can be <b>attached to your case in no time</b> to the front, back, left or right side of the palette.</p>

At the last stage of the Everlasting Wet Palette development, we sent prototypes to dozens of independent reviewers. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and we have also been able to incorporate a lot of suggestions from them into our design! But don't just take our word for it:
See reviews on our website !
SHOSHIES MINIS : "" I will definitely buy one of those""  
SPIKEYBITS : "" I will keep it on my desk""   
GEEKDAD : ""you'll love the thought that has gone into the product and find it improves your painting experience too""  
NEXT LEVEL PAINTING : ""I am not a wet palette guy, but I was pretty impressed!""  
MAGABOTATO : "" Foam and paper works perfectly for me""
FIGUREMENTORS : ""I have been very impressed with the prototype and these could be the next BIG thing""
(Please note that we did not and will never pay for reviews.)


Paint stays moist and stable for hours and days
Hydration system is easy to setup and prevents bad smells

The unique case is easy to use with perfect dimensions
Everlasting Wet Palette is leak resistant, easily portable and made of solid materials

Wavy design brush holder and well palette magnet accessory
Engineered to the last details



Your paint dilution will stay stable during your painting session for hours. The paint will not bleed and will not dry. The perfect hydration will help you master the painting techniques like a pro. This cannot be reproduced without our paper and foam.
If you close the lid the paint will stay fresh for days.
All this right out of the box



Our foam holds a lot of water compared to its size ! The final foam will be thicker than the one used during reviews and reaches 3.5mm for improved hydration while retaining the same quality.
Our special foam is naturally mold resistant. No anti-mold chemicals are added to the foam, and the effect will not wear out over time. So no bad smell after a few days, even when not stored in a fridge. Long lasting, you just need to rinse it from time to time with fresh water.
Our paper is the perfect match for our foam. It sticks on it, and does not create bubbles. 100% of the paper is in contact with the foam, for perfect hydration. It will not curl after the easy setup. It was particularly selected to offer the best performance with hobby paints and level of dilution used in hobby painting.
Machine cut to exact dimensions, taking into account the swell effect due to the water contact
The overall color is neutral, light gray, so that you can paint with ""true colours""



We designed Everlasting Wet Palette with perfect dimensions :

For easy access. 
Low raise
Compact foot print.

2 sizes are available to cater to different needs : 


Painter size, 15 by 20 cm (5,9"" x 7,9""), made for miniature painters looking for a good sized palette, that is compact and easy to carry. It's perfect for small to medium sized paint stations. Painter Everlasting Wet Palette can be extended using the top lid as a side Palette.

Studio size, 20 by 30 cm (7,9"" x 11,8""), made for Pros and Enthusiasts looking for a huge painting area. It's perfect for medium to large sized paint stations. Studio Everlasting Wet Palette can also be extended using the top lid as a side Palette.


 

When we built Everlasting Wet Palette we decided to make it :


Airtight, and leak resistant. We selected a TPE seal for its durability and so that it is easily operable.
Also, the hydration system is really stable and does not move during transport, as the foam sticks to the case naturally. 
The provided strap also contributes to making Everlasting Wet Palette a great palette to move around. The strap selected will be durable, made of Polyamide.
Finally, we selected strong, high quality ABS plastics for its durability and stability.


Wavy is the first magnet accessory available for Everlasting Wet Palette. We wanted to reinvent the way people use wells in miniature painting, by deciding on a compact size, but yet stable system thanks to the magnet. That way you can paint without fearing of hitting your wells and without consuming too much space for them. We then associated it with a brush holder. 
Wavy can be attached to your case in no time to the front, back, left or right side of the palette.

At RedgrassGames we pay a lot of importance to details, so that we obtain a perfect product at the end. For instance : 

The top lid can be stored under the bottom case
Draft angles of case and Wavy are adjusted for perfect match 
Feet are optimised for easy elastic setup... 

Bottom Case and Wavy fit perfectly
 
Easy elastic strap operation
 
The top lid can be stored under the bottom case

the range much quicker than I could manage relying solely on my own 
resources.</p>

</div></div>","Two Sets of Four 28mm Samurai Themed Miniatures for Roleplaying, Wargaming or Collecting.

We are putting together an exciting new range of semi-historical Japanese Samurai
 figures inspired by a mix of Roleplaying Games, Movies and Mythology for use in role-playing games, wargames and collecting.  This 
range of metal miniatures will initially be focused on the initial characters of our W.I.P. Rpg, Ronin Hood, but it will also include some fantasy and 
mythological creatures as well.  Your contributions will help to expand 
the range much quicker than I could manage relying solely on my own 
resources.
I am launching this range with a set of Eight Character 
miniatures sculpted by the Extremely talented Leandro Ventic.  The Characters make perfect RPG Characters or Personalities for your Armies or Collections, and are 28mm measured from top of the head to base of the foot.  

  What We Need & What You Get We are looking to expand the range with yet more Characters and Personalities and Troops, the First 8 Characters have been commissioned and paid for. Your Contribution will help the range grow and expand. 





If we exceed our funding goal, we have a few extra surprises for you.     FREEBIE FOR ALL OUR BACKERS ! 

As a thank you to all who support our campaign, I'm giving you the Monk !

<p>As a boy I lived with few close neighbors and loads of hard work. Growing up, most of my playmates were in my own head. I spent lifetimes playing as wizards or vampires, slaying dragons or noble knights. I had adventures in worlds no one else has ever seen. As I grew into adulthood I studied as both a scientist and an artist. As a scientist I learned the bitter sweetness of reality. As an artist I was able to let my mind soar. When I became too sick to hold a job I was determined to share the adventures I had grown up in and provide a place where others could visit my worlds. This campaign is all about allowing others to enjoy the excitement and wonder of one of the many worlds I grew up in.</p> <p>For years I have only been able to bring a few people with me as I wrote about my adventures. I have completed five published novels and have already designed, though it is unpublished, a more traditional fantasy RPG that my friends and I have enjoyed for years. Even in the earliest stages, my friends suggested I get it published.</p> <p>Rising Shadows is an extension and refinement of my fantasy setting. Those whom have already played in this system love it, and have encouraged me to work to complete it and get it published. I have come to learn, this is no small task. When playing with friends I can explain the rules they don’t understand and I can use shared experiences to help them see what I am trying to describe. In publishing this, I need to make the world come alive for those who will want to play in it without me there to guide them. That takes time and money. </p> <p>The world is a rich and proven genre of cyberpunk with heavy elements of fantasy. The success of movies like “Blade Runner” and anime like “Ghost in the Shell” have shown that people have a desire for the genre. Countless books such as “Neuromancer” and “Altered Carbon” have been written in this setting as well. So, the world I have chosen is one people are hungry for. </p> <p>After more than two decades of playing countless RPGs and designing a system most enjoyed by the few I have been able to play with, I understand that to make a game that will sell it needs to be set in a world people want to play in. The rules need to be open enough to let them play, but restrictive enough to give them a good challenge. The stories and illustrations need to bring the world to life. The most expensive and difficult part for me is the last one.</p> <p>The part that is the most difficult for me is the art work. Gamers like to see illustrations in their books. Great illustrations can make the difference between a gamer picking the game or not. Quality artwork can really cost. </p> <p>The rules allow for a very involved and open role-play experience. Most systems are focused extensively on combat while only touching lightly on the role-play aspect of the game. Thanks to some very talented voice actors on a channel called Critical Role, playing games like this is becoming much more popular. Players are longing for the opportunity to play a game with the freedom to have fun, even if your Game Master is not professional. This game will allow such freedom and enjoyment of combat and role-play.</p> <p>Writing compelling and immersive stories, I can do. I have already written five very enjoyable novels. Creating a world and original system that covers massive cyber and magic rules as well as balances between giants and goblins is no small task. There are currently plans for 8 manuals each over 200 pages as well as supplements for each area that will come out in time. This takes a lot of time and will require copious amounts of editing, and as I have learned from my five books, good editing is not cheap either.</p> <p>One Hundred percent of your donations and investments will go toward the development  and betterment of this game. The more money we raise the better the artwork will be and the more help I can afford to bring on the team to finish the creation of the game. Though there is no way to truly express how thankful I am for your assistance, I have assigned worthwhile rewards for various amounts invested and even given some of you the opportunity to be a part of the creation of this world and the characters who inhabit it. You will be allowing many others, old and young, to enjoy adventures in this incredible world.</p> <p>An opportunity this exciting should be shared with all your friends. Indigogo has provided tools to help you share this with almost everyone you know. Help spread the word and enhance the success of this venture.</p>

Thanks to some very talented voice actors on a channel called Critical Role, playing games like this is becoming much more popular. Players are longing for the opportunity to play a game with the freedom to have fun, even if your Game Master is not professional. This game will allow such freedom and enjoyment of combat and role-play. Writing compelling and immersive stories, I can do. I have already written five very enjoyable novels. Creating a world and original system that covers massive cyber and magic rules as well as balances between giants and goblins is no small task. There are currently plans for 8 manuals each over 200 pages as well as supplements for each area that will come out in time. This takes a lot of time and will require copious amounts of editing, and as I have learned from my five books, good editing is not cheap either. One Hundred percent of your donations and investments will go toward the development  and betterment of this game. The more money we raise the better the artwork will be and the more help I can afford to bring on the team to finish the creation of the game. Though there is no way to truly express how thankful I am for your assistance, I have assigned worthwhile rewards for various amounts invested and even given some of you the opportunity to be a part of the creation of this world and the characters who inhabit it. You will be allowing many others, old and young, to enjoy adventures in this incredible world. An opportunity this exciting should be shared with all your friends. Indigogo has provided tools to help you share this with almost everyone you know. Help spread the word and enhance the success of this venture.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>1.“Verge Of War” is a classical wargame with RPG elements.</p>
<p>2. The system is highly scalable, allowing to play both skirmishes and epic battles if players have armies of corresponding sizes.</p>
<p>3. The game uses six-sided dice (or D6), markers, cards and tokens.</p>
<p> 4. A typical game is very dynamic, consists of 6 game rounds and takes about 40-120 minutes depending on the size of the armies.</p>
<p> 5. You won’t just stand and watch during your opponent’s turn! You can react to nearly anything they do.</p>
<p>6. The mechanics of “Verge of War” are easy to learn, but there is a lot of strategy involved in its confrontations. Players will have to think carefully: before the battle begins, a player chooses skills for the army commander from three skill sets representing different strategies, doctrines or military specialties. Each set is divided into 10 levels, which reflect the experience and expertise of your commander.</p>
<p> 7. Players can explore different strategies to find the one that best fits their play style.</p>
<p> 8. The game is well-balanced: it allows to use any combinations of units and win if you apply the right tactics.</p>
<p> 9. The Free Pose Technology allows unlimited variants of poses for your models. One set provides endless pose options for your characters.</p>
<p> 10. Participate in the Verge of War universe development.</p>

<h3>It's all about having fun...</h3>
<p>My name is Mike. In 2008 my wife and I built an Irish pub in our garage called ""The Barage."" Coincidently, a good friend of mine named Chris built a sports bar in his garage called ""The Hawks Nest."" We did this for three reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>No chance of getting a DUI getting home from the bar. </li>
<li>Drink prices can't be beat.</li>
<li>We love to entertain and have a lot of fun with our family and friends.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing like rolling up the garage door on a warm day to create an instant Tiki bar. To maximize the fun, we love to play games at the bar. However, we grew tired of the same old party games. There just doesn't seem to be anything new on the market.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Chris and I formed our own company called ""<strong>Garage Bar Games</strong>"" and made our own party game.  We're exited to introduce ""<strong>Stop, Drink, and Roll.</strong>"" SDR is a super easy to learn dice game that combines some of the the best elements of other popular games. These include dice, chips, poker strategy, and rules from that drinking card game you played in college that starts with the letter ""A"" and ends in ""hole.""</p>
<h3>The rules are simple: Last player holding chips wins the game and all of the chips. Oh, and they must be in an upright position.</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491683969/n7pdrrrjvnktmggg3hiy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Player count should be anywhere from 3 to 8. Each player receives 3 chips, or any other item that might make the game more fun. Each player takes a turn rolling five dice. If a pair or three of a kind is rolled, the player must follow the action shown on the dice.</p>
<p>Example 1: Roll a beer mug, take a drink.</p>
<p>Example 2: Roll an Arrow, tell any other player to drink.</p>
<p>Example 3: Roll a Stop sign and place one chip in the center pot.</p>
<p>Example 4: Roll the word Steal and you may take one chip from any other player.</p>
<p>Example 5: Roll the word Name: The roller gives a category such as ""Brands of Beer."" Each player must name a brand of beer in rotation. If a player can not name a different brand within 5 seconds or so, they must drink and place one chip in the pot.</p>
<p>Example 6: Roll the word Rule, and the game gets really run. The roller may make a rule which applies to all other players for the remainder of the round. If a rule is broken, the players drinks. Rules we have used consist of Not using any first names or Not using your dominant hand to roll or drink. One family member came up with a rule where every time you lose a chip you must say ""I'm a dick."" The rules can add up fast. You may end up standing on one leg, using your left hand to roll, and having to say ""<i>Come on baby!"" </i>while ever other player had to yell ""F Off!"" This happened the one night.</p>
<p>Other outcomes are possible. Roll 5 different dice and nothing happens, you don't lose a chip and no one  drinks. Roll 4 of kind and you may take one chip from any other player and one from the center pot. Roll 5 of a kind and you win the game and all of the chips or whatever else is in the pot, every other player must finish their beverage.</p>
<p>This game has been tweaked and tested for maximum fun. No really, its a freakin blast. Otherwise we wouldn't be wasting your time or ours. If for some reason we do not get funded, we still win having created the next best party game for ourselves. We have also mixed it up and used items other than the chips to play with like one dollar bills. Careful on this one. It can make the game very competitive...in a good way.</p>
<p>The game is ready for mass production. We have selected an excellent manufacturer and they are awaiting for our first order. That's where you come in. We looking for 500 people to contribute <strong>$8.00</strong> (<strong>20% off the retail price of $9.95 or more</strong>). This will help fund the first order along with some other typical business expenses.</p>
<p>You will receive one of the first productions of <strong>Stop, Drink, &amp; Roll</strong>. It will include a five dice as you see in the photo and 24+1 chips. Why plus one? Because one of your drunk friends will most certainly lose a chip.It will all be housed in a professionally labeled easy to carry black tin box.</p>
<p>This one is a no brainer. A mere $8.00 for a super fun time. Don't be shy, give it a try. You'll be glad you did.</p>

</div></div>","It's all about having fun...
My name is Mike. In 2008 my wife and I built an Irish pub in our garage called ""The Barage."" Coincidently, a good friend of mine named Chris built a sports bar in his garage called ""The Hawks Nest."" We did this for three reasons.

No chance of getting a DUI getting home from the bar. 
Drink prices can't be beat.
We love to entertain and have a lot of fun with our family and friends.

Nothing like rolling up the garage door on a warm day to create an instant Tiki bar. To maximize the fun, we love to play games at the bar. However, we grew tired of the same old party games. There just doesn't seem to be anything new on the market.
Solution: Chris and I formed our own company called ""Garage Bar Games"" and made our own party game.  We're exited to introduce ""Stop, Drink, and Roll."" SDR is a super easy to learn dice game that combines some of the the best elements of other popular games. These include dice, chips, poker strategy, and rules from that drinking card game you played in college that starts with the letter ""A"" and ends in ""hole.""
The rules are simple: Last player holding chips wins the game and all of the chips. Oh, and they must be in an upright position.


Player count should be anywhere from 3 to 8. Each player receives 3 chips, or any other item that might make the game more fun. Each player takes a turn rolling five dice. If a pair or three of a kind is rolled, the player must follow the action shown on the dice.
Example 1: Roll a beer mug, take a drink.
Example 2: Roll an Arrow, tell any other player to drink.
Example 3: Roll a Stop sign and place one chip in the center pot.
Example 4: Roll the word Steal and you may take one chip from any other player.
Example 5: Roll the word Name: The roller gives a category such as ""Brands of Beer."" Each player must name a brand of beer in rotation. If a player can not name a different brand within 5 seconds or so, they must drink and place one chip in the pot.
Example 6: Roll the word Rule, and the game gets really run. The roller may make a rule which applies to all other players for the remainder of the round. If a rule is broken, the players drinks. Rules we have used consist of Not using any first names or Not using your dominant hand to roll or drink. One family member came up with a rule where every time you lose a chip you must say ""I'm a dick."" The rules can add up fast. You may end up standing on one leg, using your left hand to roll, and having to say ""Come on baby!"" while ever other player had to yell ""F Off!"" This happened the one night.
Other outcomes are possible. Roll 5 different dice and nothing happens, you don't lose a chip and no one  drinks. Roll 4 of kind and you may take one chip from any other player and one from the center pot. Roll 5 of a kind and you win the game and all of the chips or whatever else is in the pot, every other player must finish their beverage.
This game has been tweaked and tested for maximum fun. No really, its a freakin blast. Otherwise we wouldn't be wasting your time or ours. If for some reason we do not get funded, we still win having created the next best party game for ourselves. We have also mixed it up and used items other than the chips to play with like one dollar bills. Careful on this one. It can make the game very competitive...in a good way.
The game is ready for mass production. We have selected an excellent manufacturer and they are awaiting for our first order. That's where you come in. We looking for 500 people to contribute $8.00 (20% off the retail price of $9.95 or more). This will help fund the first order along with some other typical business expenses.
You will receive one of the first productions of Stop, Drink, & Roll. It will include a five dice as you see in the photo and 24+1 chips. Why plus one? Because one of your drunk friends will most certainly lose a chip.It will all be housed in a professionally labeled easy to carry black tin box.
This one is a no brainer. A mere $8.00 for a super fun time. Don't be shy, give it a try. You'll be glad you did.
By the way, pardon the low budget video. I did read the importance of how a high quality video can help sell a campaign. But let's be honest, if I had the money for a video with high production value, would I really need to ask you for your $8.00.
One last note, the rules provided are suggested rules. Feel free to tweak the game as you see fit. You may want to change the rules to accommodate a designated driver. Yep, the game is fun sober too. We're already working on variations to the game which we will provide in the future. This includes a non-drinking family friendly version. The fun is limitless.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What is Pagans of the Desolate Wastes</h3>
<p>Pagans of the Desolate Wastes is an adventure and campaign setting for the <a href=""https://lotfp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lamentations of the Flame Princess</a> old school role playing game. One hundred years ago, a psionic event known as the Cataclysm shaped the planet Califere and its inhabitants. This event separated the inhabitants into the mad Sidhe and the misshapen chimeras. In addition to those on Califere's face, an unfordable rift had been driven between the two factions. In addition to the adventure in PotDW, there will also be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brief history and map of Califere</li>
<li>Racial class for the Sidhe</li>
<li>Racial descriptions of the Sidhe and chimeras</li>
<li>Statistics for relics from before the Cataclysm</li>
<li>And monsters and NPCs from Califere</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Lamentations of the Flame Princess?</h3>
<p>James Edward Raggi IV's Lamentations of the Flame Princess was selected as the OSR rules set of choice for Pagans of the Desolate Wastes due to its more weird and raw feel than other similar RPGs. Despite this choice, PotDW will work with any OSR rules set just as well. In fact, we play tested PotDW with Swords and Wizardry Whitebox!</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>The goal of one thousand dollars is the bare minimum that we will be able to receive and still be able to afford to make Pagans of the Desolate Wastes a satisfactory product. Around three hundred will go to layout. After platforms fees, that means that around six hundred dollars will go towards art (including maps). Due to the high quality art we desire for this project, we'll be able to commission the maps, the cover, and around ten pieces of interior art. This is the minimum amount of art we are willing to include in PotDW and still consider it a finished product.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Inspirations</h3>
<p>Pagans of the Desolate Wastes draws its inspiration from many varied sources. However, the primary three sources that have inspired PotDW are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blue Öyster Cult's ""Veteran of the Psychic Wars""</li>
<li>H.P. Lovecraft's <i>The Colour from Out of Space</i>
</li>
<li>Isaac Asimov's <i>The Foundation Trilogy</i>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>Depending on if we surpass the initial goal of $1,000 by enough, there are several stretch goals that you can unlock.</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,250: Isometric Map; At this point, I will be able to afford commissioning an isometric map instead of a more traditional top-down map.</li>
<li>$1,750: Limited Print Run; If we reach this level, I'll be able to print 100 copies of Pagans of the Desolate Wastes and ship it to 100 backers. Plus, these backers will still receive all benefits of their pledge level!</li>

<p>This <i>is<i> </i></i>my first crowdfunding campaign, so it does make sense for you to be concerned. And, like all crowdfunding campaigns, there is a certain element of risk involved. There is a possibility that someone will get sick or otherwise be unable to work on the project or that we'll run into other problems along the way. Luckily, as this is a small project, the likelihood of this happening is quite small. If this does happen, I will try to keep you as updated as possible throughout the process and unless it is utterly impossible, try to deliver the product as promptly as possible.</p>

<p>The year is 1000 A.D., the European continent is constantly at war as competing political factions try to control Europe through military might and political intrigue. Will the Byzantine Empire rise again and give rebirth to the glory and ancestors of Ancient Rome? Can the upstart Kievan Rus Empire bring a new golden age of Slavic Culture and power? Or will the Fatimid Caliphate push further into Europe and create an even greater Muslim Empire?   </p>

<p> In Swords &amp; Sails, players control one of these factions in a bid to conquer Europe. Muster armies and assemble fleets, build more cities, make and break alliances, spy on your opponents, and go to war to conquer all of Europe. Players move armies consisting of six types of army combat units (Knights, Heavy Cavalry, Light Cavalry, Heavy Infantry, Light Infantry and Peasant troops) and fleets containing warships, Raider ships, and Transport units. Each season, brings the opportunity to build more units into your armies or fleets. Capture territories and build new cities to increase income. A unique combat system gives you the chance to line your troops up for battle and face off against your enemies.   </p>

<p>Swords &amp; Sails was created to maximize <i><strong>""FUN""</strong></i> game play while minimizing complexity in the rules.  Even though there are allot of components, that is to allow for the full simulation of letting players have all the choices that a historical leader may have had in 1000 AD.   Several reviewers have called Swords&amp;Sails a very good gateway Wargame as it represents the theme of a historic strategy game in a non-complex package with fairly simple mechanics.</p>
<p>Players first choose their faction to play. Each faction has its own special rules to make it feel as you are playing that Kingdom or Empire.  </p>

<p>Once the factions are selected, then play begins.   Swords &amp; Sails use the show me method to teach the game to new players.   Each faction sheet has a First Turn side which pre-defines what each factions first move should be to learn the game.  Of course once you know the game, then the first turn moves no longer need to be followed.  Phases of the game are described below, in the Rules section.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525479692/qdtu2f1ulnxqucmyrde6.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>                                     <strong>The full rules are available for download <a href=""http://www.vr-soft.com/ESW/Files/Swords&amp;Sails_rules_v11.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE:</a></strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Quick Synopsis:</strong></p>
<p>Swords &amp; Sails is a game played in phases of a Game Season (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter). All players do the phases at the same time. The phases include: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collect Income </strong></li>
<li><strong>Perform Espionage (Intrigue Adv. Rules)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Perform Diplomacy </strong></li>
<li><strong>Write Orders </strong></li>
<li><strong>Move Armies and Fleets </strong></li>
<li><strong>Resolve all Battles </strong></li>
<li><strong>Build New Units and Cities </strong></li>
<li><strong> Advance Season and Turn </strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Collect Income </h3>
<p>The money of the game is represented by Byzantium Coins. There are 4 denominations of coins, Gold, Silver, Copper, and Bronze. Players earn more income by controlling territories and cities. The empire with the most gold is generally the most powerful. </p>
<h3>Perform Espionage (Intrigue Phase)</h3>
<p>Empires enlist spies to gather information about enemy armies and fleets. Spies aren't cheap nor do they always get good information, but they were the only way to get intelligence on the other world powers.  Advanced rules, replace the Espionage Phase with the Intrigue Phase which includes Espionage as well as Political, Developmental, and Warfare based Intrigue. </p>
<h3>Perform Diplomacy </h3>
<p>The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Why go it alone when you can get a little help from your friends. Diplomacy is a major aspect to the game of Swords &amp; Sails. Be careful though as in real life not all Empires stick with their agreements. Play-testers have commented on the joy of a diplomatic game with the other options of a conquest, expansion, and economics.</p>
<h3>Write Orders </h3>
<p>All Players write their orders in secret and reveal their moves at the same time. This means essentially hidden, simultaneous movement. Players need to out guess what their opponents will do. Especially when each player will have a maximum of Five Armies and 5 Fleets to move around on the map. </p>
<h3>Move Armies and Fleets </h3>
<p>Armies and fleets only move one space on the map. If players end up in the same territory, then a battle will occur. Armies can board and be transported by Fleets, if you have enough space in your ships. Watch out for the reach of the North Sea Empire, which can use its raider fleets to move a large army very quickly. </p>
<h3>Resolve all Battles </h3>
<p>The Swords &amp; Sails battle system is an innovative method of simulating how historic medieval battles took place. Players line up their units one at a time based on battle field superiority. Players can try to oppose unit types were they may have advantage (based on analysis of famous battles in history) if they have enough troops to maneuver. The battle system is very simply while giving a light impression of miniatures combat (without any miniatures required). Many of the play testers have remarked on how they like the unique battle system. </p>
<h3>Build New Units and Cities </h3>
<p>Players can build new units into their armies and fleets every season if they have the money to recruit new troops or build new ships. Historically armies in the medieval period were heavy in mercenaries coming from all over in Europe. Cities represent the basis of trade and economy in the game. Empires can build up the cities in any territory they control. Cities also add defensive capability in a territory, making it harder for your opponents to capture. Players can build minor cities and then in the next season upgrade them to major cities. </p>
<h3>Advance Season and Turn </h3>
<p>The Season is advanced, income updated and scores are tallied at the end of each season.</p>
<p><strong>Winning the Game:</strong> Victory Points are earned based on income, number of allies, and number of conquered enemy capitals. The smaller powers require fewer Victory Points than the larger players, giving England and France just as much chance to win as the large powers of Byzantium or the Holy Roman Empire. Games can be short, 40 victory points (2-3 hours), medium, 60 victory points (3-5 hours), or long, 90 victory points (5+ hours). When allied all allies either win together or loose together and must declare ally status during the diplomacy phase.</p>
<p><strong>Campaign Style Rules:</strong> As noted by several of our play testers the game can be used as a campaign game which will run longer than a normal play session. The rules are versatile enough to run as a play by mail, electronic mail, or over a Skype session and a version is in progress for Tabletopia (TM) and other popular tabletop simulators. Players can choose to use the advanced combat rules for determining battles or substitute their own favorite miniatures game to define battle outcomes.</p>

<p>As this game is particularly heavy (the metal coins weigh several pounds by themselves) , we will get the best shipping price we can find at the time of fulfillment depending on your location. Below is the current estimated shipping costs based on destination.  Note, shipping is by weight, therefore add-ons may increase shipping costs.</p>

<p>                  (Shipping Credit may be additionally extended as part of later stretch goals) </p>

<p>Addons can be added to any pledge, just add the amount for the addon below to your pledge.  </p>
<ul>
<li>$29 - 2 Player Pak of Coins (6 gold, 10 silver, 10 copper, and 14 bronze).   </li>
<li>$45 - 4 Player Pak (12 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Copper, 28 Bronze)            </li>
<li>$78 - 7 Player Pak (21 Gold, 35 Silver, 35 Copper, 49 Bronze)                        </li>
<li>$55 - Extra Large play mat 48"" x 36"" (rolled up Map) shipped separately  </li>
<li>$20 - Each additional Minor Player (Minor Player factions will be unlocked as stretch goals) consisting of 5 Army Cards, 5 Fleet Cards, 1 Diplomat Cards, 1 set of 2 Custom Faction Dice, 5 Army Cubes, 5 Fleet Pieces, 1 set of additional Minor Player Generic Army / Fleet units (40 Count).</li>
<li>$45 - 3 additional Minor Players (Minor Players will be unlocked as stretch goals)</li>
</ul>
<p>You must add up the cost of the rewards listed above that you would like and this amount will carry over to the pledge manager before shipping. Notice shipping costs will be added on in the Pledge Manager step.</p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>First I would like to thank all the people who have helped me create Swords&amp;Sails. I could not have done this without you. This includes Quinten Stearns, Quentin Williams, Aurora Stearns, my wife Amber, and a whole slew of friends (which will be listed in all the credits).</p>
<p>We have been developing this game over the past 6 years and it's our second crowd funded project. The first project was the swords&amp;Sails Historic Byzantine Coins. The risks have been minimized by learning the manufacturing, shipping, and fulfillment process with the coins campaign. We have found the best manufacturing and fulfillment companies to partner with for the Swords&amp;Sails game. We will be using Quarter Master Logistics in the U.S. (a CoolStuffInc company) and Games Quest for the EU to complete world wide shipping.</p>
<p>This is a huge game with a huge map and with lots of components which has a much higher than average cost to make. So to help make this goal, everyone needs to spread the word about this game and get all your friends to back.</p>

                               Featuring artwork from medieval artist Richard Luschek II.
The Swords&Sails Board Game has been in development for over 6 years and was successfully funded using the KickStarter crowdfunding platform with $28,247 Pledged of the original $20,000 goal and with 6 stretch goals unlocked on April 29th, 2018.  
Now you can join in helping us increase the funding and increasing the stretch goals to make an even more deluxe game on the Indiegogo platform.

The year is 1000 A.D., the European continent is constantly at war as competing political factions try to control Europe through military might and political intrigue. Will the Byzantine Empire rise again and give rebirth to the glory and ancestors of Ancient Rome? Can the upstart Kievan Rus Empire bring a new golden age of Slavic Culture and power? Or will the Fatimid Caliphate push further into Europe and create an even greater Muslim Empire?   

 In Swords & Sails, players control one of these factions in a bid to conquer Europe. Muster armies and assemble fleets, build more cities, make and break alliances, spy on your opponents, and go to war to conquer all of Europe. Players move armies consisting of six types of army combat units (Knights, Heavy Cavalry, Light Cavalry, Heavy Infantry, Light Infantry and Peasant troops) and fleets containing warships, Raider ships, and Transport units. Each season, brings the opportunity to build more units into your armies or fleets. Capture territories and build new cities to increase income. A unique combat system gives you the chance to line your troops up for battle and face off against your enemies.

When we get the first of either goal above, we will add a Utility Excel Spreadsheet for players to manage their Armies and Fleets.   This spreadsheet will work on Smart Phones and Tablets (and of course PCs).  
If we get both Social Media stretch goals, we will add functions such as calculate Damage rolls and other combat features.
A later stretch goal will be to make this into a full blown App which will be able to calculate quick combat results battles between players, but will also require the social media stretchgoals be unlocked first.

Swords & Sails was created to maximize ""FUN"" game play while minimizing complexity in the rules.  Even though there are allot of components, that is to allow for the full simulation of letting players have all the choices that a historical leader may have had in 1000 AD.   Several reviewers have called Swords&Sails a very good gateway Wargame as it represents the theme of a historic strategy game in a non-complex package with fairly simple mechanics.
Players first choose their faction to play. Each faction has its own special rules to make it feel as you are playing that Kingdom or Empire.  

7 POLITICAL FACTIONS  

BYZANTIUM EMPIRE  
KIEVAN RUS’ EMPIRE 
HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE 
FATIMID CALIPHATE 
KINGDOM OF FRANCE 
KINGDOM OF ENGLAND 
NORTH SEA EMPIRE (proto, under Sven Forkbeard)

5 Minor Factions (As stretch goals, add ons or PnP) 


Caliphate of Qurtuba 
Kingdom of Hungary 
Kingdom of Poland 
Kingdom of Leon
First Bulgarian Empire

More about Factions in The Factions Video:

Once the factions are selected, then play begins.   Swords & Sails use the show me method to teach the game to new players.   Each faction sheet has a First Turn side which pre-defines what each factions first move should be to learn the game.  Of course once you know the game, then the first turn moves no longer need to be followed.  Phases of the game are described below, in the Rules section.

                                     The full rules are available for download HERE:  
Quick Synopsis:
Swords & Sails is a game played in phases of a Game Season (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter). All players do the phases at the same time. The phases include: 

Collect Income 
Perform Espionage (Intrigue Adv. Rules)
Perform Diplomacy 
Write Orders 
Move Armies and Fleets 
Resolve all Battles 
Build New Units and Cities 
 Advance Season and Turn 

Collect Income 
The money of the game is represented by Byzantium Coins. There are 4 denominations of coins, Gold, Silver, Copper, and Bronze. Players earn more income by controlling territories and cities. The empire with the most gold is generally the most powerful. 
Perform Espionage (Intrigue Phase)
Empires enlist spies to gather information about enemy armies and fleets. Spies aren't cheap nor do they always get good information, but they were the only way to get intelligence on the other world powers.  Advanced rules, replace the Espionage Phase with the Intrigue Phase which includes Espionage as well as Political, Developmental, and Warfare based Intrigue. 
Perform Diplomacy 
The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Why go it alone when you can get a little help from your friends. Diplomacy is a major aspect to the game of Swords & Sails. Be careful though as in real life not all Empires stick with their agreements. Play-testers have commented on the joy of a diplomatic game with the other options of a conquest, expansion, and economics.
Write Orders 
All Players write their orders in secret and reveal their moves at the same time. This means essentially hidden, simultaneous movement. Players need to out guess what their opponents will do. Especially when each player will have a maximum of Five Armies and 5 Fleets to move around on the map. 
Move Armies and Fleets 
Armies and fleets only move one space on the map. If players end up in the same territory, then a battle will occur. Armies can board and be transported by Fleets, if you have enough space in your ships. Watch out for the reach of the North Sea Empire, which can use its raider fleets to move a large army very quickly. 
Resolve all Battles 
The Swords & Sails battle system is an innovative method of simulating how historic medieval battles took place. Players line up their units one at a time based on battle field superiority. Players can try to oppose unit types were they may have advantage (based on analysis of famous battles in history) if they have enough troops to maneuver. The battle system is very simply while giving a light impression of miniatures combat (without any miniatures required). Many of the play testers have remarked on how they like the unique battle system. 
Build New Units and Cities 
Players can build new units into their armies and fleets every season if they have the money to recruit new troops or build new ships. Historically armies in the medieval period were heavy in mercenaries coming from all over in Europe. Cities represent the basis of trade and economy in the game. Empires can build up the cities in any territory they control. Cities also add defensive capability in a territory, making it harder for your opponents to capture. Players can build minor cities and then in the next season upgrade them to major cities. 
Advance Season and Turn 
The Season is advanced, income updated and scores are tallied at the end of each season.
Winning the Game: Victory Points are earned based on income, number of allies, and number of conquered enemy capitals. The smaller powers require fewer Victory Points than the larger players, giving England and France just as much chance to win as the large powers of Byzantium or the Holy Roman Empire. Games can be short, 40 victory points (2-3 hours), medium, 60 victory points (3-5 hours), or long, 90 victory points (5+ hours). When allied all allies either win together or loose together and must declare ally status during the diplomacy phase.
Campaign Style Rules: As noted by several of our play testers the game can be used as a campaign game which will run longer than a normal play session. The rules are versatile enough to run as a play by mail, electronic mail, or over a Skype session and a version is in progress for Tabletopia (TM) and other popular tabletop simulators. Players can choose to use the advanced combat rules for determining battles or substitute their own favorite miniatures game to define battle outcomes.

As this game is particularly heavy (the metal coins weigh several pounds by themselves) , we will get the best shipping price we can find at the time of fulfillment depending on your location. Below is the current estimated shipping costs based on destination.  Note, shipping is by weight, therefore add-ons may increase shipping costs.

                  (Shipping Credit may be additionally extended as part of later stretch goals) 

Addons can be added to any pledge, just add the amount for the addon below to your pledge.  

$29 - 2 Player Pak of Coins (6 gold, 10 silver, 10 copper, and 14 bronze).   
$45 - 4 Player Pak (12 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Copper, 28 Bronze)            
$78 - 7 Player Pak (21 Gold, 35 Silver, 35 Copper, 49 Bronze)                        
$55 - Extra Large play mat 48"" x 36"" (rolled up Map) shipped separately  
$20 - Each additional Minor Player (Minor Player factions will be unlocked as stretch goals) consisting of 5 Army Cards, 5 Fleet Cards, 1 Diplomat Cards, 1 set of 2 Custom Faction Dice, 5 Army Cubes, 5 Fleet Pieces, 1 set of additional Minor Player Generic Army / Fleet units (40 Count).
$45 - 3 additional Minor Players (Minor Players will be unlocked as stretch goals)

You must add up the cost of the rewards listed above that you would like and this amount will carry over to the pledge manager before shipping. Notice shipping costs will be added on in the Pledge Manager step.
Risks and challenges
First I would like to thank all the people who have helped me create Swords&Sails. I could not have done this without you. This includes Quinten Stearns, Quentin Williams, Aurora Stearns, my wife Amber, and a whole slew of friends (which will be listed in all the credits).
We have been developing this game over the past 6 years and it's our second crowd funded project. The first project was the swords&Sails Historic Byzantine Coins. The risks have been minimized by learning the manufacturing, shipping, and fulfillment process with the coins campaign. We have found the best manufacturing and fulfillment companies to partner with for the Swords&Sails game. We will be using Quarter Master Logistics in the U.S. (a CoolStuffInc company) and Games Quest for the EU to complete world wide shipping.
This is a huge game with a huge map and with lots of components which has a much higher than average cost to make. So to help make this goal, everyone needs to spread the word about this game and get all your friends to back.",15.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>Cultistorm is the expression of our respect and love for H. P. Lovecraft.

P. Lovecraft. We want to create an excellent board game for those who know and love Lovecraft, and we would like to make Lovecraft’s work known to those who are board game fans.</p>

<p><strong>Why are we launching a new campaign on Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>Cultistorm ran a successful campaign during May 2019. Nearly 1,000 awesome backers pledged their trust and support. <strong>We have already prepared and produced the Base Game of Cultistorm. </strong>These games are on their way to our backers at the time of writing this. We are also going to showcase our game at Essen Spiel ‘19. The second and third boxes (Deluxe Expansions and Collector Box) are expected to be mass-produced and shipped in May 2020.</p>
<p>So why did we start this campaign on Indiegogo?</p>
<p><strong>1.) Cultistorm deserves to be acknowledged by more people!</strong></p>
<p><strong>First of all, we would like everybody to know about Cultistorm. There are many people who might have missed our Kickstarter campaign. </strong>Cultistorm was designed by a highly dedicated team who have put a lot of effort, creativity, and love into this game. We firmly believe that we have created a unique and exciting game set in the Cthulhu genre.<br/>The co-operative game mechanics, the massive content, lots of expansion modules, the beautiful art and illustrations, the short story book and the illustrated narrative storybook with 500+ scripts, the thrilling yet authentic music album by Graham Plowman composed specifically for our game, and finally the stand-alone minigames make this project truly unique and give meaning to our slogan: “More than an ordinary board game”. </p>
<p><strong>2.) Unlock a lot of Stretch Goals</strong></p>
<p>In our previous campaign we barely started to unlock our stretch goals because we had a very high (and realistic) funding goal, which we could only reach some days prior to the end of the campaign. However,<strong> we did not spend all that time to come up with all those awesome stretch goals, just so that we could scratch those ideas</strong>… We truly want everybody to get as much free content as is humanly possible to pack into one box, but for this to happen we need more than 1,000 people. So come and join us on this quest.</p>
<p><strong>3.) Brand new minigames</strong></p>
<p>Last but not least, we are also designing five standalone minigames set in the universe of Cultistorm. <strong>We would like to offer these to you either for individual purchase or by getting them as free stretch goals as part of your Collector Pledge.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>Every stretch goal unlocked here will be added either to the Deluxe or the Collector box of EVERY game. <strong>So those of you who have previously backed us on Kickstarter will also get the stretch goals unlocked here.</strong> We want to reward the brave investigators who spearheaded this project and made it possible for us (and for you on Indiegogo) to be here today. Those of you who are about to join us will of course get all the content unlocked up until the very end of our Kickstarter campaign, maximizing the content of your pledge. This is the reason for our low funding goal and this is how we can make <strong>this campaign a win-win for everybody.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Face-2-Face:</strong> This is a 2-player deduction game specifically designed for Essen Spiel ’19. It has a play time of 10-15 minutes. In this game, an Investigator and a Cultist have to face each other. The goal of the Cultist is to use his intuition to summon his dark master, whereas the Investigator has to rely on his deduction skills to stop the Great Old One from entering the game. Face-2-Face is a fast-paced game with a good flow. We highly recommend switching roles after the first game to experience how it feels to be in the shoes of your opponent.</p>
<p><strong>Little Ritual:</strong> This is also a 2-player game, but this one is a co-operative game. The Investigators must use their joint powers to stop the Cultists’ mad ritual. The game uses completely different mechanics from those in Cultistorm for utilizing the skills of the Investigators and generating skills for the Cultists.</p>
<p><strong>Traitor:</strong> This is a 5–10-player social deduction game where we take part in the dark and secret activities of a Cultist sect. The members of the sect have to embark on expeditions to find artifacts that will help them to open gates to otherworldly dimensions. What the Cultists do not know is that two brave undercover agents have infiltrated their ranks. They must sabotage the Cultists’ plans without being found out.</p>
<p><strong>Persecutors: </strong>This is a 2–5-player co-operative game where the Investigators are exploring a randomly generated map. Each location on the map offers some kind of action to the players, but also contains many dangers. The Investigators must find the cultists, while they themselves have to escape from the Mi-Go which is devouring their last shreds of sanity.</p>
<p><strong>Alone in the Dark: </strong>This is a single-player logical game where the player has to solve the mystery of sealing the otherworldly gates. The game gets harder with each passing round.</p>

<h3>Illustrated Script Book – with 500+ flash fiction stories</h3>
<p>We have devised an efficient way to enhance your immersion in the Lovecraftian atmosphere of Cultistorm: we bring you a Script Book with 500+ flash fiction stories from the weird fiction genre. Every character and location (whether from this world or another), the investigators, the cultist sects, and the different events all get their own stories. You can also read a story before an encounter with a cultist – not only will this intensify your gaming experience, it can also have a direct effect on the encounter. The narrative gameplay with the Script Book makes Cultistorm a deep and truly story-driven adventure.</p>
<p>The Script Book will come as a beautiful hardcover book with full-page colour illustrations.</p>

<h3>Hardcover Short Story Collection</h3>
<p>We want to make the game as immersive as possible. Instead of adding flavour texts to cards, we are compiling short stories with the help of a team of talented weird fiction writers. To accompany the game we offer a complete volume of short stories, which is worthy of Lovecraft’s literary heritage and the genre requirements he created. The short stories are directly connected to the different casts of cultists, locations, and Great Old Ones appearing in the game, creating a detailed world and a rich backstory on a scale quite unusual in the realm of board games. </p>

<h3>Soundtrack album – with music by Graham Plowman</h3>
<p>If you feel like listening to some music while reading or playing, you can turn on Graham Plowman’s album, which he created especially for Cultistorm. Graham is perhaps the most acknowledged composer of the Lovecraftian subculture. He creates his Lovecraftian atmosphere with a mixture of symphonic orchestra and choir music, using instruments from Lovecraft’s own time. His music is powerful, authentic, and of incredibly high quality.</p>
<p>Before you continue to read this page, why not listen to the track below? Turn up the volume and let Graham Plowman’s fantastic music transport you into the universe of Cultistorm.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Here are short overviews<br/>of all expansions for Cultistorm:</strong></p>
<h3>Narrative Expansion</h3>
<p>The Narrative Expansion is one of Cultistorm’s greatest extensions, giving you not just a literary background, but a completely new gaming experience. The Add-on includes a set of special cards which are used when encountering a Cultist with special symbols. The stories in the Script Book are not just mood elements: they can directly affect your game in a variety of ways, depending on which choice you choose to make during these special encounters.</p>
<h3>Campaign Expansion</h3>
<p>The “Storm of Cultists” Campaign Expansion unfolds over the course of a seven-part story. It is played in separate sessions with unique and consecutive missions and introduces completely new game mechanics.</p>
<h3>Overlord Expansion</h3>
<p>The “Behind the Scenes” Overlord Expansion allows one of the players to assume the role of H. P. Lovecraft and take over the game. The other players unite to fight him.</p>
<h3>Solo Expansion</h3>
<p>We have prepared the “Lonely Struggle” Solo Expansion for those solitary detectives who wish to take up the fight on their own.</p>
<h3>Nine minor expansions</h3>
<p><strong>The OTHERWORLDS</strong> expansion adds a special Location card to every Great Old One. These cards represent otherworldly dimensions which open in our world after the arrival of the Great Old Ones.</p>
<p><strong>The ANCIENT RELICS  </strong>are powerful objects from other dimensions. To obtain them, the Investigators need to find the right Locations and open the dimensional gates themselves, risking their sanity. </p>
<p><strong>DARK RITUALS </strong>activates the experience points on the Investigator Action Cards. They can be spent to learn dark rituals from ancient tomes. These can then be used to unlock further actions.</p>
<p><strong>The CULISTS EVENTS </strong>expansion adds a Cultist event deck. At the beginning of each Cultist phase, the players need to draw a card from this deck and watch as the event unfolds. This rarely bodes well for the players…</p>
<p><strong>In the INNOCENT VICTIMS </strong>expansion the Investigators have to save civilians caught up in the fight between Investigators and Cultists from becoming Cultists themselves. However, this is just one of their many tasks: the Investigators still need to defeat the Cultists and the Great Old Ones in order to save the world.</p>
<p><strong>The OTHERWORLDLY DISEASES</strong> expansion unleashes diseases of unknown origins onto the world. The Investigators must stop them from spreading and infecting cities.</p>
<p><strong>The DANGEROUS PUZZLES </strong>adds a six-card special relic to the Item deck; the players must find it to win the game. The pieces of the puzzle are lethal objects in themselves, not to mention that cards unleashing unexpected and horrible events also enter the deck alongside them.</p>
<p><strong>RESEARCH EVENTS </strong>is an expansion that actually helps the Investigators, making the game easier by countering other modules that make the game even harder. When an Investigator carries out research, he draws a card and applies its (usually positive) effect.</p>
<p><strong>The RORSCHACH TEST </strong>expansion was inspired by one of the short stories in our collection, “The Inkblots”. More and more otherworldly inkblots are appearing throughout the game. They do not influence the game immediately, but if the players accumulate a certain number of unresolved inkblots, a Great Old One is summoned, whose dreams are depicted by the blots.</p>
<h3>Lovecraft Country: Game Night Expansion</h3>
<p>We have developed a special and innovative expansion module for Cultistorm which makes it possible to play Cultistorm at multiple tables: the games played at the various tables are connected and merge into a gigantic common fight. In this way Cultistorm can be played by 30 people simultaneously, the events of the different teams influencing each other. This feature forges the separate games – which are complete by themselves – into one epic gaming experience. This expansion module was developed especially with game nights and board game clubs in mind – as far as we know, this gameplay module would already make Cultistorm a unique gaming experience.</p>

<p>There will not be any Stretch Goals augmenting the quality of the cards or adding embossed letters to the box, because we have already designed everything this way. For Cultistorm, high quality is the default option, not an optional extra.</p>

<div>Below is a list of estimated shipping costs. Although we did everything in our power to provide you with precise estimates, they are just estimates, and costs may change based on weight increases owing to unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you may select.</div>

<div>
<p>If you do not see your country in our shipping list, there might be various reasons for it. It might not be considered “friendly” for shipping or it is considered too expensive/difficult to ship to. Please send us a private message and we will do our best to find a solution. </p>
<p>In most cases, you will not face customs charges or VAT either, as we offer Customs Friendly Shipping to the countries where most of our backers are located.</p>
<p>Backers who do not complete their pledge manager by the deadline (which will be specified via email notification) may need to have their rewards shipped from the EU. This may incur additional shipping costs for international backers that would need to be paid for at that time. </p>
<p>Due to the size of the rewards and the risk of bounce back, we cannot ship to PO Boxes either domestically or internationally.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>A huge, cross-cultural, and ambitious project like Cultistorm will require tremendous efforts from our team. We are passionate and committed to this project and we are constantly learning and developing ourselves for the benefit of our games and backers. We promise to keep you informed on the project with regular and frequent updates so that you can always be sure of your investment.</p>
<p><strong>Sandor Szucs, designer of Cultistorm, won the first Hungarian game designing competition held by Piatnik in 2014. Co-Founder of Purple Meeple Games, Zoltan Aczel founded the GÉMKLUB Board Game Publishing company, which represents numerous international publishers in Hungary (e.g. Asmodee, Blue Orange, Czech Games, Gigamic, Portal Games, Rebel, Rio Grande, Thinkfun).</strong></p>
<p>The estimated delivery date for this project is May 2020, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We have done our best to minimise this as much as possible and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some unforeseen reason the game cannot be delivered at all.</p>
<p><strong>REFUND POLICY</strong></p>
<p>We offer a full refund, including fees, for up to 14 days after the project ends. After the 14-day-period and until we pay for the production agreement with the manufacturer, we offer a no questions asked refund minus Indiegogo and payment processing fees (which we cannot recover). Once we have paid for the production agreement with the manufacturer, we do not offer a refund. If we fail to fulfil your game, you are entitled to a full refund, including fees.</p>
<p>All refunds after the 14-day-period may be processed via reversed payment through Stripe to your credit card, at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are issued through payment reversal via Stripe to your credit card.</p>
<p>This project is funded in USD. All refunds will be issued in USD, minus applicable indiegogo and payment processing fees depending on the time of your refund request.</p>
</div></div>","Cultistorm is the expression of our respect and love for H. P. Lovecraft. It is more than just an ordinary board game – this is a Lovecraftian gaming experience with literary and musical dimensions. Our theme choice was motivated by a deep commitment to the work and heritage of H. P. Lovecraft. We want to create an excellent board game for those who know and love Lovecraft, and we would like to make Lovecraft’s work known to those who are board game fans.



A highly interactive gaming experience offering unique cooperative game mechanics where every player is of equal importance.

Scalable difficulty: the game’s setup options allow players to adjust the difficulty of the challenges they will face (this feature is included in the base game).

Narrative Expansion and Script Book: the true jewel of Cultistorm is a hardcover book containing 500+ pieces of high quality weird fiction, illustrated with colourful full-page artwork. The Narrative Expansion is a story-driven game mode in which the stories impact the game itself.

Solo Expansion for those solitary detectives who wish take up the fight on their own.

Campaign Expansion: seven connected and increasingly challenging scenarios introducing new game mechanics.

Overlord Expansion: this adds a sixth player who takes on the role of Lovecraft himself. As a puppet master, this player controls the cultists, and thus the whole game.

Nine minor expansion modules: each of these introduces new game mechanics, increasing the replayability and difficulty of Cultistorm. Most modules can be played simultaneously.

Five standalone minigames: we are currently designing five completely different minigames in the universe of Cultistorm. We plan to make them available for purchase individually or as part of the free Stretch Goals for our Collector Pledge.

Game Night Expansion (as add-on): this unique and innovative expansion provides the possibility of combining up to six separate Cultistorm games into one epic story. A common fight, in which the choices of the different teams can impact each other. This expansion was developed specifically for clubs who organise board gaming events.

Hardcover Short Story Collection: the stories were specifically written for the game by a group of fifteen experienced authors with a vast knowledge of weird fiction writing.

Cultistorm Soundtrack by Graham Plowman: crafted especially for Cultistorm by one of the most renowned composers of the genre, this album gives you something to listen to as you uncover the twisted secrets of Arkham.

Metal Investigator Badge: ree gift for every Collector backers.


Why are we launching a new campaign on Indiegogo?
Cultistorm ran a successful campaign during May 2019. Nearly 1,000 awesome backers pledged their trust and support. We have already prepared and produced the Base Game of Cultistorm. These games are on their way to our backers at the time of writing this. We are also going to showcase our game at Essen Spiel ‘19. The second and third boxes (Deluxe Expansions and Collector Box) are expected to be mass-produced and shipped in May 2020.
So why did we start this campaign on Indiegogo?
1.) Cultistorm deserves to be acknowledged by more people!
First of all, we would like everybody to know about Cultistorm. There are many people who might have missed our Kickstarter campaign. Cultistorm was designed by a highly dedicated team who have put a lot of effort, creativity, and love into this game. We firmly believe that we have created a unique and exciting game set in the Cthulhu genre.The co-operative game mechanics, the massive content, lots of expansion modules, the beautiful art and illustrations, the short story book and the illustrated narrative storybook with 500+ scripts, the thrilling yet authentic music album by Graham Plowman composed specifically for our game, and finally the stand-alone minigames make this project truly unique and give meaning to our slogan: “More than an ordinary board game”. 
2.) Unlock a lot of Stretch Goals
In our previous campaign we barely started to unlock our stretch goals because we had a very high (and realistic) funding goal, which we could only reach some days prior to the end of the campaign. However, we did not spend all that time to come up with all those awesome stretch goals, just so that we could scratch those ideas… We truly want everybody to get as much free content as is humanly possible to pack into one box, but for this to happen we need more than 1,000 people. So come and join us on this quest.
3.) Brand new minigames
Last but not least, we are also designing five standalone minigames set in the universe of Cultistorm. We would like to offer these to you either for individual purchase or by getting them as free stretch goals as part of your Collector Pledge.
IMPORTANT: Every stretch goal unlocked here will be added either to the Deluxe or the Collector box of EVERY game. So those of you who have previously backed us on Kickstarter will also get the stretch goals unlocked here. We want to reward the brave investigators who spearheaded this project and made it possible for us (and for you on Indiegogo) to be here today. Those of you who are about to join us will of course get all the content unlocked up until the very end of our Kickstarter campaign, maximizing the content of your pledge. This is the reason for our low funding goal and this is how we can make this campaign a win-win for everybody.

MORE ADD-ONS


We have designed 5 completely different minigames  set in the universe of Cultistorm. In each of them, Cultists and Investigators have to compete against each other, but always in different ways.
Face-2-Face we specifically designed with Essen Spiel ‘19 in mind. This game will be available for purchase at our stand, but those of you who miss out on it can purchase this game as an Add-on for 10 USD. 
Exclusive Add-on:

Special Stretch Goals:
The other four minigames are planned as unlockable stretch goals for this campaign. If we manage to unlock them, all of them will be added to EVERY COLLECTOR BOX free of extra charge. Base Game and Deluxe Game backers can still add these games to their order in the Pledge Manager afterwards. However, only Collector backers receive them for free if they are unlocked.

Face-2-Face: This is a 2-player deduction game specifically designed for Essen Spiel ’19. It has a play time of 10-15 minutes. In this game, an Investigator and a Cultist have to face each other. The goal of the Cultist is to use his intuition to summon his dark master, whereas the Investigator has to rely on his deduction skills to stop the Great Old One from entering the game. Face-2-Face is a fast-paced game with a good flow. We highly recommend switching roles after the first game to experience how it feels to be in the shoes of your opponent.
Little Ritual: This is also a 2-player game, but this one is a co-operative game. The Investigators must use their joint powers to stop the Cultists’ mad ritual. The game uses completely different mechanics from those in Cultistorm for utilizing the skills of the Investigators and generating skills for the Cultists.
Traitor: This is a 5–10-player social deduction game where we take part in the dark and secret activities of a Cultist sect. The members of the sect have to embark on expeditions to find artifacts that will help them to open gates to otherworldly dimensions. What the Cultists do not know is that two brave undercover agents have infiltrated their ranks. They must sabotage the Cultists’ plans without being found out.
Persecutors: This is a 2–5-player co-operative game where the Investigators are exploring a randomly generated map. Each location on the map offers some kind of action to the players, but also contains many dangers. The Investigators must find the cultists, while they themselves have to escape from the Mi-Go which is devouring their last shreds of sanity.
Alone in the Dark: This is a single-player logical game where the player has to solve the mystery of sealing the otherworldly gates. The game gets harder with each passing round.

 
COMING SOON...
(After we reached our Funding Goal)
 

Illustrated Script Book – with 500+ flash fiction stories
We have devised an efficient way to enhance your immersion in the Lovecraftian atmosphere of Cultistorm: we bring you a Script Book with 500+ flash fiction stories from the weird fiction genre. Every character and location (whether from this world or another), the investigators, the cultist sects, and the different events all get their own stories. You can also read a story before an encounter with a cultist – not only will this intensify your gaming experience, it can also have a direct effect on the encounter. The narrative gameplay with the Script Book makes Cultistorm a deep and truly story-driven adventure.
The Script Book will come as a beautiful hardcover book with full-page colour illustrations.

Hardcover Short Story Collection
We want to make the game as immersive as possible. Instead of adding flavour texts to cards, we are compiling short stories with the help of a team of talented weird fiction writers. To accompany the game we offer a complete volume of short stories, which is worthy of Lovecraft’s literary heritage and the genre requirements he created. The short stories are directly connected to the different casts of cultists, locations, and Great Old Ones appearing in the game, creating a detailed world and a rich backstory on a scale quite unusual in the realm of board games. 

Soundtrack album – with music by Graham Plowman
If you feel like listening to some music while reading or playing, you can turn on Graham Plowman’s album, which he created especially for Cultistorm. Graham is perhaps the most acknowledged composer of the Lovecraftian subculture. He creates his Lovecraftian atmosphere with a mixture of symphonic orchestra and choir music, using instruments from Lovecraft’s own time. His music is powerful, authentic, and of incredibly high quality.
Before you continue to read this page, why not listen to the track below? Turn up the volume and let Graham Plowman’s fantastic music transport you into the universe of Cultistorm.

We would like to offer a very special opportunity for the most dedicated of Investigators: joining one of the most dangerous operations of the Agency and fighting as an undercover agent within the ranks of the Cultists.
You can join this mission by pledging for the special “Undercover Agent Pledge” – but places are limited!
The first 13 brave fighters will have the chance to join the ranks of the undercover agents. We will require mugshots from the participants, to be illustrated by our graphic designers. In this way you can become part of the Cultistorm universe via the 13 undercover Investigator cards. The aim of this pledge is straightforward: we want to allow our fans and backers to support us to a bigger extent via this pledge.

What you get with this pledge: 

Collector Pledge
An additional Collector Pledge as a present
Free Reinforcement Has Arrived Add-on
Free Game Night: Lovecraft Country Add-on
A unique Cultist card with your own portrait
Your very own short story in the Script Book
Free shipping
All unlocked Stretch Goals



We promise to release official rulebook translations in German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Hungarian. These will be made available as PDF downloads.

Some of the actual rules of the final version of the game differ from the ones shown in the videos. The most up to date videos are going to be uploaded soon.

In the INNOCENT VICTIMS expansion the Investigators have to save civilians caught up in the fight between Investigators and Cultists from becoming Cultists themselves. However, this is just one of their many tasks: the Investigators still need to defeat the Cultists and the Great Old Ones in order to save the world.
The OTHERWORLDLY DISEASES expansion unleashes diseases of unknown origins onto the world. The Investigators must stop them from spreading and infecting cities.
The DANGEROUS PUZZLES adds a six-card special relic to the Item deck; the players must find it to win the game. The pieces of the puzzle are lethal objects in themselves, not to mention that cards unleashing unexpected and horrible events also enter the deck alongside them.
RESEARCH EVENTS is an expansion that actually helps the Investigators, making the game easier by countering other modules that make the game even harder. When an Investigator carries out research, he draws a card and applies its (usually positive) effect.
The RORSCHACH TEST expansion was inspired by one of the short stories in our collection, “The Inkblots”. More and more otherworldly inkblots are appearing throughout the game. They do not influence the game immediately, but if the players accumulate a certain number of unresolved inkblots, a Great Old One is summoned, whose dreams are depicted by the blots.
Lovecraft Country: Game Night Expansion
We have developed a special and innovative expansion module for Cultistorm which makes it possible to play Cultistorm at multiple tables: the games played at the various tables are connected and merge into a gigantic common fight. In this way Cultistorm can be played by 30 people simultaneously, the events of the different teams influencing each other. This feature forges the separate games – which are complete by themselves – into one epic gaming experience. This expansion module was developed especially with game nights and board game clubs in mind – as far as we know, this gameplay module would already make Cultistorm a unique gaming experience.







 
These review videos have been made with the Prototype version of Cultistorm. The actual game has improved in many ways since. The Base Game is being released at the same time as we start this campaign. We are going to upload review videos with the final version of the game as soon as we can.​
 

 


 

 

 

 

 



There will not be any Stretch Goals augmenting the quality of the cards or adding embossed letters to the box, because we have already designed everything this way. For Cultistorm, high quality is the default option, not an optional extra.
What this means:

310gsm linen finish cards
Laser-engraved dice
Practical plastic vacuum-form insert, big enough to hold sleeved cards

Our manufacturing partner:

Some example projects of LongPack Games are Raiders of the North Sea, Darkest Night Second Edition, Unfair, Grimm Forest, Robinson Crusoe, Kingdomino, Dream Home, Planet of the Apes, Panic Mansion, Carcosa, and Planetarium.


We will collect shipping costsvia our Pledge Manager after the campaign ends.


Below is a list of estimated shipping costs. Although we did everything in our power to provide you with precise estimates, they are just estimates, and costs may change based on weight increases owing to unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you may select.
 


If you do not see your country in our shipping list, there might be various reasons for it. It might not be considered “friendly” for shipping or it is considered too expensive/difficult to ship to. Please send us a private message and we will do our best to find a solution. 
In most cases, you will not face customs charges or VAT either, as we offer Customs Friendly Shipping to the countries where most of our backers are located.
Backers who do not complete their pledge manager by the deadline (which will be specified via email notification) may need to have their rewards shipped from the EU. This may incur additional shipping costs for international backers that would need to be paid for at that time. 
Due to the size of the rewards and the risk of bounce back, we cannot ship to PO Boxes either domestically or internationally.



 
Risks & Challenges
A huge, cross-cultural, and ambitious project like Cultistorm will require tremendous efforts from our team. We are passionate and committed to this project and we are constantly learning and developing ourselves for the benefit of our games and backers. We promise to keep you informed on the project with regular and frequent updates so that you can always be sure of your investment.
Sandor Szucs, designer of Cultistorm, won the first Hungarian game designing competition held by Piatnik in 2014. Co-Founder of Purple Meeple Games, Zoltan Aczel founded the GÉMKLUB Board Game Publishing company, which represents numerous international publishers in Hungary (e.g. Asmodee, Blue Orange, Czech Games, Gigamic, Portal Games, Rebel, Rio Grande, Thinkfun).
The estimated delivery date for this project is May 2020, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We have done our best to minimise this as much as possible and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some unforeseen reason the game cannot be delivered at all.
REFUND POLICY
We offer a full refund, including fees, for up to 14 days after the project ends. After the 14-day-period and until we pay for the production agreement with the manufacturer, we offer a no questions asked refund minus Indiegogo and payment processing fees (which we cannot recover). Once we have paid for the production agreement with the manufacturer, we do not offer a refund. If we fail to fulfil your game, you are entitled to a full refund, including fees.
All refunds after the 14-day-period may be processed via reversed payment through Stripe to your credit card, at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are issued through payment reversal via Stripe to your credit card.
This project is funded in USD. All refunds will be issued in USD, minus applicable indiegogo and payment processing fees depending on the time of your refund request.",46.0,8,"1 Campaign

<p>Each player has the same six miracle cards available to use during the game. Players can also pray for a spiritual gift, which provides an ongoing benefit and can help shape your strategy. Much as in real life, preaching has greater impact in areas that have not yet been reached by the gospel.

Against this backdrop, their are multiple strategies that can be successfully employed. </p>

It is our intention, with your help, to use any raised funds towards 3D printing, casting, packaging and the distribution of this range.The profits will go towards the realisation of a strong character cast, each developing into their own unique part in our story and becoming miniatures in their own right.If the kickstarter goes beyond our expectations we will expand, creating new miniatures, game designs, and employ more artists to help realise our world and bring it to you. Our World and CharactersAs with any good story you need heroes and villains and that's exactly where we started.All of these characters form the introductory model range to our story and miniature line up.Character CastFrom left to right:
The Veiled Emissary
Lazarus
The Kyrios
The Slaver
The Miniatures:Each of our cast are conceptualised and developed, blending backgrounds and storylines to link our characters. Using a talented team of artists, the artwork and 3D renders are created to build the foundation of the miniature we present to you.Each of our designs is prototyped using 3D print technology, allowing us to have highly detailed moulds for the resin miniatures that we hope you will enjoy.3D Printed example - The Veiled Emissary
The Completed Renders & Miniatures for you

Why should you pledge?
We are very proud of what we have achieved so far, but with your help and support you can help take Cerberus Studios into the next phase, continuing the line of characters and miniatures we have planned for you and welcoming you into a world we want you to be a part of.
Why put your trust in us?
We are serious about modelling and gaming; we are striving to deliver quality, highly detailed miniatures and characters to you that bring you joy in whatever capacity, be it modelling, painting, gaming or a journey into a new world.We are working with well established and renowned artists and manufacturers with years of experience in production and development, and our project lists expand into stand alone games, stories and more.
In summary...
By supporting us we will deliver our first range of detailed miniatures to you.  Our opening line up includes:
4 Characters
Beast/Mount
Selection of accessories including Dice Trays, T-shirts, Limited Edition Artwork
Options on our future releases
We look forward to seeing these miniatures on your tabletops, work stations and battlefields. Let’s make this happen together!
The future
Should we be lucky enough to achieve our goal we are already in a position to go beyond our current lineup. We have already visualised a further:
10 Main Characters
3 Infantry Units
3 Beasts/Mounts
And also in the process of creating:
Large Displays and Tabletop Scenic products
Novellas
and more...
It is our mission to bring all of this to you and with your support create a world that you want to be a part of.
From all of the team here at Cerberus Studios, ‘thank you!’

As a result, the majority of the displayed designs are close to being finalised, only requiring some slight colour modification, final templating and any realignment based off the samples we will receive once pre-production kicks off.</p><p>Even so, we have allowed for a fairly long pre-production phase. This gives us time to ensure the quality of the final product, and allows appropriate time to tackle any challenges we meet. This timeline also means we avoid the Lunar New Year celebrations in China, which would otherwise delay our production.</p><p>Although it is unlikely, it is possible that we may face issues related to our design templates, e.g. colour selection needing to be altered. While we will endeavour to keep the final product as close to our prototypes as possible, we may have to make some adjustments to accommodate for the process of mass manufacturing. If this is the case we will give you prompt, clear updates so you are totally informed.</p><p>Shipping</p><p>Shipping cargo from one part of the planet to many other parts is a challenge for any crowdfunding venture in this category. But again, we have planned an over-ample timeframe for shipping, to accommodate both the usual delays and any unexpected circumstances. While we can only give approximations based off our best and current knowledge, we would rather provide later dates and higher estimates than recklessly oversell something.</p><p>Communication</p><p>We have backed our share of projects, so we know to expect the unexpected. And we understand how crucial it is to maintain open and clear communication with backers throughout the entire process, not only during the initial campaign but up to and beyond final delivery. We want everyone who makes a pledge to have a clear idea of what is happening with the project at any given time, and we want to be accessible to backers who have questions regarding the project.</p><p>Terms and Conditions</p><p>You acknowledge with your pledge that the final product, as stated above, may differ from that of the initial prototype shown in materials, appearance, and reward contents.</p><p>To minimise delays and get accurate estimates for mass production, we must keep strict deadlines. As such you agree that you will confirm your final reward through our pledge manager (see FAQ) on or before its closing time. While we will strive to accommodate later orders/revisions via email up until four weeks after the close of the pledge manager, this will be entirely discretionary on our part and may result in not all rewards being able to be fulfilled. We will contact you by email in regards to the closing of our pledge manager on no fewer than three separate occasions to ensure you have ample notification to confirm your final reward. If we receive no email contact from you within eight weeks of the close of the pledge manager, then you accept that your reward is void.</p><p>As gamers who dearly love this project and want to see it helping people to populate their tabletops with awesome terrain, getting this product made and delivered to you is our number one priority. So we will do everything in our power to get your rewards to you as closely as outlined and in as timely a fashion as possible.</p><p>By pledging to this project you agree to these terms.</p></div>","Metro Morph is a modular building terrain system for 28–32mm tabletop miniature games.It is an affordable way to quickly and easily fill gaming tables with terrain that is visually striking, strong, and versatile.

As such, while we can never truly predict the future, these dates are a more realistic guideline we can do best to deliver upon.   ProductionWhile this is Crowd Forge Studio’s first project on such a scale, we feel confident we will be able to deliver the final product both on budget and on time, due to our diligent pre-planning and our tendency to err on the side of caution for our projected timeframes.We have had great communication with our proposed manufacturer from the earliest stages of design, which has allowed us to plan ahead and circumnavigate most of the common pitfalls inherent in such projects. As a result, the majority of the displayed designs are close to being finalised, only requiring some slight colour modification, final templating and any realignment based off the samples we will receive once pre-production kicks off.Even so, we have allowed for a fairly long pre-production phase. This gives us time to ensure the quality of the final product, and allows appropriate time to tackle any challenges we meet. This timeline also means we avoid the Lunar New Year celebrations in China, which would otherwise delay our production.Although it is unlikely, it is possible that we may face issues related to our design templates, e.g. colour selection needing to be altered. While we will endeavour to keep the final product as close to our prototypes as possible, we may have to make some adjustments to accommodate for the process of mass manufacturing. If this is the case we will give you prompt, clear updates so you are totally informed.ShippingShipping cargo from one part of the planet to many other parts is a challenge for any crowdfunding venture in this category. But again, we have planned an over-ample timeframe for shipping, to accommodate both the usual delays and any unexpected circumstances. While we can only give approximations based off our best and current knowledge, we would rather provide later dates and higher estimates than recklessly oversell something.CommunicationWe have backed our share of projects, so we know to expect the unexpected. And we understand how crucial it is to maintain open and clear communication with backers throughout the entire process, not only during the initial campaign but up to and beyond final delivery. We want everyone who makes a pledge to have a clear idea of what is happening with the project at any given time, and we want to be accessible to backers who have questions regarding the project.Terms and ConditionsYou acknowledge with your pledge that the final product, as stated above, may differ from that of the initial prototype shown in materials, appearance, and reward contents.To minimise delays and get accurate estimates for mass production, we must keep strict deadlines. As such you agree that you will confirm your final reward through our pledge manager (see FAQ) on or before its closing time. While we will strive to accommodate later orders/revisions via email up until four weeks after the close of the pledge manager, this will be entirely discretionary on our part and may result in not all rewards being able to be fulfilled. We will contact you by email in regards to the closing of our pledge manager on no fewer than three separate occasions to ensure you have ample notification to confirm your final reward. If we receive no email contact from you within eight weeks of the close of the pledge manager, then you accept that your reward is void.As gamers who dearly love this project and want to see it helping people to populate their tabletops with awesome terrain, getting this product made and delivered to you is our number one priority. So we will do everything in our power to get your rewards to you as closely as outlined and in as timely a fashion as possible.By pledging to this project you agree to these terms.",32.0,3,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","FMP is a brand new company,
focused on creating tabletop and roleplaying games. We strive to make our
games fun and affordable, so that no gamer feels excluded. Our first project is
a miniature wargame called Awakening: Recon, which takes place in a sci-fi setting
where races compete for dominion over the galaxy's resources.
As a gaming company we are not
only focused on the mechanics of the game but also in its content, So you can
expect from us not only fun and addictive games, but compelling back-story and
setting development.
We hope you enjoy playing our
games as much as we enjoy creating them.
By Gamers, For Gamers.


Awakening: Recon is a miniature game set in our galaxy thousands of years in the future. The Awakening was the arrival of the Ipse to our galaxy, a species completely alien to all of our galaxy's life forms. The races now compete for the ever scarcer resources of the galaxy, sometimes coming into conflict with one another. This is the main focus of the game, the initial skirmishes between the mysterious Ipse, the human coalition of mega corporations called The Consortium, a tribal race of amphibious aliens called the Dagonians, and the hermit Alphas, the remnants of a fallen civilization.






The  galaxy has had many a period of turmoil in it's unending voyage through the cosmos. But none has been more devastating than the one that was precipitated by the Ipse. A race whose sole purpose seems to be the annihilation of life in the cosmos has presented itself, and some of this galaxy's inhabitants are not about to go quietly into oblivion.



The Dagonians, first of the galaxies races to encounter these new foes, are amphibious aliens, who are proud in their millennial traditions of war and combat. They are fierce warriors, but many succumbed to the raw power of this new foe. it was time to regroup and find new systems to colonize and make a stand.




The Consortium, are comprised of mega corporations, that  provide every need to most systems of the civilized galaxy. The new foes described by some outer rim traders seemed ludicrous at best. But the expansion of the Dagonians led to an in depth investigation that proved  The comercial powerhouse to be ill equipped to deal with these new threats.


The Alphas have lived in seclusion for centuries. since the falloff their own civilization, they have retreated to secluded planets, and with their great knowledge of robotics and genetics observed the galaxy, instead of taking an active role in it. The Ipse however threatens to endanger everyone, and the Alphas  are  adept of preventing catastrophes such as the ones themselves suffered.






It's our firm decision to have high quality miniatures that provides to the gammer with detail figures to the more expert painter and easy to paint to the newbie.
Our miniatures will be resin casted and mostly with 44 mm tall, depending in the miniature pose.
We have decided to produce the miniatures in our headquarters in Portugal in order to keep the cost as low as possible and the quality control in high standards.





This is how we presented some of our first masters @ Comic Con:

And here are some of our first resin models that we couldn't resist to paint them:

<h2> Game Overview</h2>
<p>The Language of Magic is a deck-building card game which can be played in two ways: 2-player duel – players attempt to build an arsenal of powerful Words of Magic to overcome their opponent, or 2-4 player cooperative or solitary play – players work together to battle the Lich and its minions, defeating it before it can cast its final spell. As a solo or co-op player, you take on the role of the Avatar, chosen heroes of spirituality who are to do battle with the Master of Hythloth, the vile Nefarious Lord Zorhkar and his minions of the abyss.</p>
<p> There are 26 words of power, each representing their own idea. These words can be combined to make powerful spells to harm, mend, protect, or alter the creatures and the world around you. Some words, the incantations, direct the polarity of the spell. Will you create, negate, or steal? Other words add elemental powers, some can add to or multiply the effect. There are so many possible spells, you will need to play it for yourself to see what you can come up with.</p>

<p>Headless Hydra Press is a new company owned by me, Shane Collins. Like many people, I lost my job in 2020. Since then, I - along with a team of writers I've known and gamed with for many years (Joe, Ana, and Frank) - have been working hard to make accessories and supplements for tabletop roleplaying games. The current global crisis may have impacted how we play tabletop RPGs, but not why.  TTRPGs are an extremely social experience and we play for the great times we have with family and friends. We aim to create supplements, adventures, and products to enhance that experience.</p>
<p>Moreover, we believe that EVERYONE (not just straight white dudes) love this hobby and we aim to make everyone feel both welcomed and represented by our characters and artwork, something that has not historically been the case in this hobby. When I GM, the most important thing to me is that every player at my table feels like they belong there and that is how we approach our products.</p>
<p>In addition to Hexplorer Magnetic Tile Systems, we publish monthly adventure bundles for Fifth Edition.

We've run two crowd-funding campaigns successfully, getting backers their rewards ahead of schedule both times - and we intend to do the same here. This will be our first time working with a printing press so the only potential source of delay is related to the printing of the books and potential shipping delays related to COVID-19.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Run for your lives!!! Vikings are coming!!!</h3>
<p>Take your Drakkar (dragon-ship) to raid a neighbour village, steal it's treasure and return with it to your town. But danger lurks in these restless waters! You have to be aware of enemy ships and the will of the Gods!!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Choose your town, and start sailing to get the treasure. You have enough resources and warriors to reach your destination, but not for the return trip. Each turn consumes one resource. You can put your crew to work and sail faster but it will mean spending more resources and you may end up marooned at sea without food for the rest of the journey.</p>

<p>If you feel lucky you can move to special houses that allow you to draw cards from the deck that can bless your trip or make you wish you stayed back in your town sharpening your axe and sewing your armour.

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h2>
<p>Although our injection molding specialist have pre-flighted the CAD designs for the CNC milled molds, there may be issues when creating the actual parts. This will result in the files being sent back to our injection molding engineer for further refinement. This is a process we have already extensively went through and should not be an issue fixing any problems that arise.</p>
<p>Created not only by the <strong>Esquivelli bros</strong>, <strong>Build It!</strong> has been crafted by a small team of contract artists, print shop providers, an additional CAD engineer. and a musician. These contributors consist of 20+ people supporting the project from all around the world. All of these people will be credited in the final production version.</p>
<p>To ensure product quality the game has been redesigned twice from the ground up. In the testing process we listened carefully to our players at the meetups and conventions that we attended. We made sure to address the problems that they made clear to us.</p>

The wall building parody board game. Love it or hate it, you'll build it!
 

Build walls to stop the incoming Cargo Trucks!

Or build Ramps!

Cranes!

and Tunnels to get over the wall!
 
 
Created by the Esquivelli Bros!

Two brothers bring you a one of a kind board gaming experience, Build It!
With 25 years of combined experience in graphic design, CAD development, 3D printing, animation, and video editing Andrew and Brian have a solid skill base for product development.
Projects that never reached commercialization include a board game, card game, and table-top game as well as countless mods for video games.
These two companies were instrumental during the prototyping process.

 
What is Build It?

A parody board game about building the wall along the southern border, or, getting right on over it using ramps, cranes, and tunnels. Deliver contraband to sanctuary cities as the Mexico player(s) using cargo trucks. As USA, load agents onto patrol cars and intercept cargo trucks to stop them and build the wall.
Deliver 3 crates to each city, 9 total, as Mexico to win.
Build the wall 3 high all the way across, 24 total, as USA to win. 

 
What's in the box:

Contents

24 Wall Sections
3 Ramps
2 Cranes
1 Tunnel
6 Checkpoints
9 Crate Tokens
6 Key Tokens
8 Vehicle Tokens
128 Cards
2 Dice
1 Game board
1 Rule sheet

 
What the funds will be used for:
We are asking for funds to cover the production run costs of our first short run. Above is a picture of our 3D printed prototype along with various digital 2D cards and board pieces.

Our primary manufacturer, Delano Service, will provide the following

Board
Cards
Cardboard Cutouts
Dice
Rule sheet
Fulfillment

At a price of $22,811, from their facility in Battle Creek, Michigan.



 

Additionally, the plastic injection molded pieces will be provided by our plastic injection specialist, Star Rapid, in Zhongshan, China. They will produce pieces using ABS PA-757 material and P20 CNC milled molds. These parts include the -

Wall Sections
Ramps
Cranes
Tunnel
Checkpoints




At a total cost of $14,184 for tooling and $12,716 for parts.
This is a total of $26,900.
These parts will be shipped from China to our primary manufacturer and added to the boxes with the rest of the components.
Manufacturing will come out to a total of $49,711.
The Indiegogo fee will be approximately $3,000
An additional $2,500 will be used for any last minute expenditures or fluctuations in market prices effecting both paper and plastic prices for our manufacturers. This will also help cover any overrun.
This will leave us at a total of $55,000 to get Build It! off the ground.

 
Risks & Challenges:
Although our injection molding specialist have pre-flighted the CAD designs for the CNC milled molds, there may be issues when creating the actual parts. This will result in the files being sent back to our injection molding engineer for further refinement. This is a process we have already extensively went through and should not be an issue fixing any problems that arise.
Created not only by the Esquivelli bros, Build It! has been crafted by a small team of contract artists, print shop providers, an additional CAD engineer. and a musician. These contributors consist of 20+ people supporting the project from all around the world. All of these people will be credited in the final production version.
To ensure product quality the game has been redesigned twice from the ground up. In the testing process we listened carefully to our players at the meetups and conventions that we attended. We made sure to address the problems that they made clear to us.

<li>
<b>Casual mode: </b>Easy to learn and teach, only 15 - 30 mins to play</li>
<li>
<b>Challenge mode:</b> Additional depth for experienced players, try out a special Scenario</li>
<li>
<b>Competitive mode: </b>Much more deterministic mode of the game, with fixed treasures and it relies much more on the skill of the players than a lucky topdeck or discovery</li>
<li>
<b>Ultimate Mode (Stretch goal):</b> A different way to play with branching quests for each character and deterministic gameplay. Directly integrates the story and history of the different Realities together with the gameplay</li>

<li>Shuffle both of coordinate decks (column and row) </li>
<li>Take the top card of each coordinate deck - showing a pair of coordinates - row and column. </li>
<li>Randomize the purple generic tokens face down. Take a purple generic token and place it face down (without looking at it) on that position, on top of the card occupying the card at those coordinates. Do this eight times. </li>

Please note that we will add shipping fee for the add-ons (including all pledge with the add-on items).What if everyone you know, loved, and remembered are just complex simulations in a computer-generated universe? What if you began to see through the shroud that separates what you think is your life from what is real? What if you wake up from this simulation, only to wonder if you are in another?Simulation Theory is a Boardgame for 1 to 6 players which combines elements of an escape room and a dungeon delve. The game has 3 major modes for different audiences from casual (17 minutes playtime) to hardcore (2+ hours). Simulation Theory is played with a combination of standees, cards, boards, and Dice. The dice are mainly used for tiebreakers.Simulation Theory was created by Mark G. Koh (Megacorp), Shawn Siow, and an international team. For the full credits, see team credits below. We put together this Kickstarter campaign because we cannot build this without you.The base game will include 3 realities, each with 5 unique characters. The 6th character per reality will be available as a stretch goal. Each of these characters has their own strengths and weakness plus a unique backstory which has a real impact in the Ultimate mode (rules and game components will update soon)Several ways to play

Casual mode: Easy to learn and teach, only 15 - 30 mins to play

Challenge mode: Additional depth for experienced players, try out a special Scenario

Competitive mode: Much more deterministic mode of the game, with fixed treasures and it relies much more on the skill of the players than a lucky topdeck or discovery

Ultimate Mode (Stretch goal): A different way to play with branching quests for each character and deterministic gameplay. Directly integrates the story and history of the different Realities together with the gameplay
Congratulations! You guys made it to unlocked ""Ultimate mode - Stretch goal"". In Ultimate Mode, players need to complete various quests, unique to each Character, to gain treasure and Ascend to the next Reality. Each turn, players also discover part of the story of Simulation Theory and can choose to take different actions towards one of four unique outcomes per Character.  This mode will take a much longer amount of time to play than the casual or challenge mode – we estimate around 2 hours for a full game with players that are familiar with the other modes of Simulation TheoryStretch Goal Unlocked : Ultimate ModeThis mode rules assume players are already familiar with the Challenge Mode and Comepetitive Mode rules an the basics of Simulation Theory are assumed here.SETUP 
Choose one reality. Take it's challenge deck. Find and remove the boos card, shuffle the challenge deck. Place the boss card at the center (3,3) position on the 5x5 board and fill out all the other spaces with the challenge cards face-up on the board from top to bottom, starting left to right. 
Shuffle both of coordinate decks (column and row) 
Take the top card of each coordinate deck - showing a pair of coordinates - row and column. 
Randomize the purple generic tokens face down. Take a purple generic token and place it face down (without looking at it) on that position, on top of the card occupying the card at those coordinates. Do this eight times. 
Each player chooses a character from the present reality. 
Setup each player with their story tracker card on the left hand side of their character card. place the life token on ""2"" position and the book token on the ""1"" story node position for each character
FIRST TURN POSITIONS During the first turn of ultimate mode, players each take their standee and choose a challenge card which is not surrounded by 4 cards orthogonically (e.g.: has a card above, below, left and right of it) - this is that player's STARTING POSITION. Each player's standee must be at least 2 spaces (horizontally or vertically) away from the next player. Two standees can be diagonally next to each other. All players must agree on their positions before the game commences. Players cannot choose a starting position with a token or standee on it.TURN SEQUENCE  There are three parts in each turn, a planning phase, an action phase and a quest phase.PLANNING PHASEDuring the planning phase, all players act simultaneously. Each player chooses which action to perform in this phase:  -MOVE  Move the character standee into an adjacent space by specifying coordinates with the dice. The space chosen must be horizontally or vertically next to the standee. A move cannot be made into a diagonal space. Do this by placing the two dice on one of the characters traits on the board (the first to represent a row number and the second to represent a column number.) The character must have an equal or higher trait value to the challenge card in order to move onto it, otherwise they will lose one health. Can move onto challenge cards with a token or another standee (e.g.: another player) on it, if they do  -REST [recover life]  If a player has 0 life, this is the only action they may perform The player gains 1 life and may not perform any other actions this turn. To perform a heal action. The player places his dice onto a trait of his choice but with the numbers 6/1ACTION PHASE  The action phase happens after all players are ready and reveal their dice placements. Each player who chose to move, moves their standees now. Then each player that chose the heal action, increases their health by one position. If their standee was lying down (0 health), they now place them upright.-INTERACT/ATTACKA character that lands on a challenge card with another player/character on it triggers an attack. If a character standee moves into a space with a token on it, this triggers an interaction. Interacting with a PURPLE generic token triggers a story event for that player in the QUEST PHASE -UNLOCK CHARACTER QUEST --UNLOCK CHARACTER QUESTCharacter Quests can be unlocked when a player moves onto a card which is any one part of a 1-3 card pattern matching a quest unlock pattern that that player has. The player must declare it when it happens when they resolve during the QUEST PHASEQUEST PHASE During the quest phase players resolve the story items that are triggered due to the course of their actions. For PURPLE TOKENS - these tokens are turned number side up. The player then refers to the ultimate mode manual pdf and will look to ""Encounter Events"" section of that reality and do the actions on encounter events.For CHARACTER QUESTS: these are the quests that are unlocked and are often narratives from a character's memories/past.INJURY AND DEATH IN ULTIMATE MODE  Taking damage: Characters are dealt damage as a consequence of story events or combat. Whenever a character is dealt damage, move their health that number of positions equal the damage to the left of their life trackASCENSION IN ULTIMATE MODE  Ascending from the present reality in ultimate mode is the objective of each session. A player that successfully completes any combination of 7 character quests and events will asend. Failing this, the player that enters the 3/3 position after the final boss of the reality is defeated OR if the final event runs out of time (in ACT 4) will ascend.  THE END OF THE GAME  Each session of ultimate mode is set in one reality. The players play until one player Ascends and then the session is finished and scores are taken.SCORING IN ULTIMATE MODE  At the end end of each session, each player counts the the following as their score1. ascension tokens - the player that ascends receives the gold ascension token and has 20 VP  2. treasure - the face value of each treasure card collected counts as VP3. Quests - each quest card has a VP value4. EVENTS -each major events card has a VP value5. HEALTH - every point of health a player has at the end of the session converts to 1VP6. Trait tokens - take the total number of positive trait tokens minus the number of negative trait tokens a character has, this converts to VP RETAINING SCORE Each player should record down their scores for an ultimate mode session. The scores should be cumulative into the next session. Until all available realities are completed, the final winner is the player with the highest total score of all sessions Basic Gameplay: Casual ModeThis describes fundamental core mechanics only: the game has much more to offer in two other modesSimultaneous TurnsPlanning Phase: Secretly select which card to hit, and which trait to useEveryone simultaneously reveals their plan Action Phase: Compare your stats to the card
Miss - Leave the card face up for later
Win - Gain a treasure!
Lose - Skip the next turn, or discard a treasure

Which one is real? Who knowsThe Stone  Legend has it that millennia ago, a star fell from the heavens crashed into the world of Gaeus. It is said that this stone is imbued with such vast power that anyone that touches the stone would perish. Other stories claim that instead of dying from its touch, someone worthy would be able to wield its Godlike power. The stone was thought to be lost but has been rediscovered when a mighty quake cracked the earth asunder, revealing the ancient temple that was built around it. As it is, the primacy of the 8 God Kings is threatened by a warlord immune to their magic, who is also amassing a tremendous horde. Heroes have experienced fevered dreams, brought about by the stone calling to them.You are one such stoneseeker. You awake disoriented, having lived some other life in a place where magic does not exist and the God-kings do not rule.The land of Teres, where the stone fell, is now a hotbed of political intrigue, with adventurers and royals alike gambling their lives on reaching the stone first. And through it all, a horrid otherworldly blight twists all life it touches as it spreads unchecked. Will the stone grant you the power to fulfill your wishes?The Prison  You awake, wearing a prison jumpsuit and strapped to a Virtual Reality machine. You are deep in the bowels of a black site that officially does not exist; Level 44.The prison is the infamous Simbulan Penitentiary, located in the city of San Miguel. The prison is privately owned and staffed by sadistic ex-criminal guards and robotic EXA units.But you are not in any normal cell. The machine you were connected to moments ago should induce Virtual Enhanced Interrogation. The technology is so advanced that the life you just experienced feels more real than the shithole you are now trapped in. None of this is even remotely legal, even by the corrupt standards of San Miguel.Suddenly the locks on your cell open as a prison riot rages throughout the facility. The supermax inmates have spilled over into the black site, taking over section by section in a murderous rage. Is it too late to escape? Is it too late for answers?The Ark  After the near-apocalyptic singularity event on Earth, the newly risen AI's left behind a seemingly benevolent member of their kind, GENECIA. Her intervention veered humanity away from the brink of extinction, by providing them the gift of viable long-distance space travel. A part of that gift is the designs of the Genisis Ark. Like millions of others, you are on one such Ark. Yours is headed toward P4-11, a habitable planet.You awake in a cryo-pod as one of the privileged few who went on this journey to a new home with their entire body intact. Less important colonists only had their brains transported, awaiting their bodies to be reconstructed when the new world is settled.The Ark has virtual reality programs to keep the minds of those in stasis active. Your VR sim was strange, almost entirely too real. That, and you were woken too soon. Alarms are blaring, the life support system seems to have been damaged. The ship's AI is mysteriously absent. Where is the captain? Can you save the mission? Can you save yourself?Designer note: We didn't just 'tack on some lore' for our game - we take storytelling very seriously. The story behind each reality in Simulation Theory is part of the MEGACORP UNIVERSE

*Distributors:Asia: Ludus Distributors (Philippines), Animart (Indonesia), VX Global (Singapore), Phantasia games (Taiwan)Europe: Intrafin (EU, Switzerland & UK)For first time players and for casual groups with non-gamers, Simulation Theory's casual mode is easy to learn and can be a hit at parties (Yes, we even did demos in public AT parties). Learn the basics here. This is a simple 1v1 playthrough in casual mode in a hotel roomRemember that all our playthrough videos use rudimentary placeholder art. Please do not judge the components by what you see here. The standees and the main board components are not shown.The purpose of these videos is to demonstrate the core mechanics and craftsmanship of STG's game design. The two other game modes (challenge/adventure) build on the knowledge from playing casual mode at least once. Challenge mode utilizes the basic rule framework of the game to deliver almost infinite replayability with Challenge scenarios (you can try the ones below with the print and play!). Believe us, it is almost like designing an entirely new game each time.""Arkfall"" - 4 Players - Stone Reality Scenario   ""Decontamination Protocol"" - 3 players - Prison Reality ScenarioCompetitive mode is a much more deterministic mode of the game, with fixed treasures and it relies much more on the skill of the players than a lucky topdeck or discovery. The challenge cards are dealt face up in a 5x5 grid, with the boss card at its center. Ascensions move the boss.Playthrough video of Competitive mode in SingaporeWhat Others Says About Simulation Theory Game IGN Post-launch (SEA)IGN Pre-launch (SEA)Games Hub (Malaysia)Tantrum House - on 37:50 mark in the podcast (USA)Game It (Spain)DAGeeks (Philippines)Board Game Geek (USA) Many thanks to Lytt Labs for manufacturing the official STG watch!

Mathematically calculated, perfectly thought out, a hymn to  greatness of human mind, and a symbol of the unity of Europe; it became the largest scientific and cultural center of human civilization for almost two decades. </p><p>Everything changed in 1872. On the night of June 20<sup>th</sup>, the city was struck by the Eclipse — a cataclysm of unknown nature, which left a turbulent whirlpool in the place where the island had been. The disaster was terrifying. Everyone was convinced the city, like Atlantis, had perished at the bottom of the sea, and all its inhabitants died; the price for its attempt to compare with the gods.</p><p>But the truth was different. On the night of the Eclipse the city was moved to another reality — gray, cold, and lifeless; where the sky was covered with low clouds. Later, this place came to be called Limbo; because most of all it resembled the threshold of Hell, come to life from the pages of Catholic manuscripts.</p><p>In Limbo, the forced immigrants found food, water, and even some deposits of metals. But the most important thing they found was brimstone, ""hell stone,"" an amazing fossil fuel that burned several times hotter and longer than coal. The findings gave a powerful impetus to the development of steam technologies. Only one serious obstacle was in the way of the scientific and technological revolution: lack of a stable inflow of new resources. So, when three years after the disaster the Embassy of demons came to the City with a proposal to open a portal back to the real world in exchange for the right to trade, the authorities were glad to have such a bargain. </p><p>In September 1875, appearing from thin air, a steam locomotive with several cars rolled out with clatter and clang onto the half ruined railway bridge which once had connected the island of Krk with the continent.</p><p>Over the next 15 years, the appearance of the city changed completely. Smoke from trains, factories, steam trams, and steam cars stained the walls that used to be snow-white. The streets were entangled with a network of pneumomail tubes.

Mathematically calculated, perfectly thought out, a hymn to  greatness of human mind, and a symbol of the unity of Europe; it became the largest scientific and cultural center of human civilization for almost two decades. Everything changed in 1872. On the night of June 20th, the city was struck by the Eclipse — a cataclysm of unknown nature, which left a turbulent whirlpool in the place where the island had been. The disaster was terrifying. Everyone was convinced the city, like Atlantis, had perished at the bottom of the sea, and all its inhabitants died; the price for its attempt to compare with the gods.But the truth was different. On the night of the Eclipse the city was moved to another reality — gray, cold, and lifeless; where the sky was covered with low clouds. Later, this place came to be called Limbo; because most of all it resembled the threshold of Hell, come to life from the pages of Catholic manuscripts.In Limbo, the forced immigrants found food, water, and even some deposits of metals. But the most important thing they found was brimstone, ""hell stone,"" an amazing fossil fuel that burned several times hotter and longer than coal. The findings gave a powerful impetus to the development of steam technologies. Only one serious obstacle was in the way of the scientific and technological revolution: lack of a stable inflow of new resources. So, when three years after the disaster the Embassy of demons came to the City with a proposal to open a portal back to the real world in exchange for the right to trade, the authorities were glad to have such a bargain. In September 1875, appearing from thin air, a steam locomotive with several cars rolled out with clatter and clang onto the half ruined railway bridge which once had connected the island of Krk with the continent.Over the next 15 years, the appearance of the city changed completely. Smoke from trains, factories, steam trams, and steam cars stained the walls that used to be snow-white. The streets were entangled with a network of pneumomail tubes. The metal steam-powered sun rolled on a huge metal rail in the sky.The city received a new name: the Web. Once again it became a cultural, scientific, and financial center of society — but a society quite unlike the old one.  Other conditions, other creatures, other social rules, and other laws of physics gave rise to a new, wonderful world.In this world, the authorities lead diplomatic negotiations with demons; inventor-technomages dream of creation of a reasonable automaton; researchers look for traces of ancient civilizations; leaders of the criminal world and brilliant detectives fight for the right to set the rules — here, in the shine of the metal steam sun.What are you going to play? The City of the Steam Sun is designed for stories in the genres of classic detective, Victorian horror, and adventures in the style of Indiana Jones and Alan Quatermain. Each story can develop within the same genre, or combine the features of several.Detective – Stories in the spirit of Arthur Conan Doyle or Agatha Christie will be good for those who like to work with information, analyze it, and move step-by-step to victory. The heroes of such stories are employees of a detective agency, guards, or even individuals who were affected by the consequences of some crime. Search for clues, questioning witnesses, matching data from different sources – you will feel the gray cells of your brain wake up.Horror – Stories in the style of Victorian horror or mystical horror are easy to imagine in the world in which here and there you meet fanatical scientists who are ready to sacrifice to science not only their lives, standards of morality, and ethics; but also the lives of anyone who happens along. That is why here, you can face out-of-control scientific experiments, crazy infernal machines and their creators, as well as numerous creatures and entities that live in the depths of Limbo: ghosts, ancient deities, cursed tombs and so on; as if from the fantasies of Howard Lovecraft.Adventure and crypto-detective – Limbo is a place with a rich history; it keeps many secrets that excite the imagination of researchers. Confusing mazes on the outskirts, mysterious traps and vague clues, mystical coincidences leading heroes to the goal. And, of course, smart competitors following heroes to the finale.And all this is in the atmosphere of the late XIX century; in the city which turned from the Utopia of the Rational Age into the dark Web; in the world of steam devices and technomagic —  the arcane background whose adherents use special equipment to work miracles.Why you will like to play itThe City of the Steam Sun is a deeply developed world in which the latest steam technologies coexist with ancient powerful magic.
More than 40 new edges.
Three new arcane backgrounds with unique game mechanics: Technomages, relying on their equipment, Blessed Ones, who create miracle from their own life force and Dark Mages, who make grim sacrifices to gather power.
Flexible rules for creation of inventions, suitable for those who want to dive into creation of a new device and enjoy choosing components and their various combinations; as well as those who prefer to assemble their mechanisms quickly.  Create your own fine tuned weapons, transport and even semi-intelligent automatons.
Three ready adventures, one per each genre. Discover plot behind the robbery of the officer of Expeditionary Force in the Case of the Winged Statuette, face horrors of the House of Forgotten and reveal some ancient secrets of Limbo on the Path of the Piligrim.
Lots of secret societies.
And a wide range of air and steam guns for all fans of steampunk.

But the translation, which was the hardest part, is finished; so we think that we’ll be able to complete the rest of the project in time. Most problematic part is art. We have all the art we need for the current version of the book, but if we add new art to the Book of Creator – due to stretch goal or Benefactor pledge – there may be some delays; but they won’t affect release date of the player’s part of the book. The same goes with our tarot; we want the whole deck to be illustrated by one artist, so it may take some time.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Mountain Circuit</h3>
<p>The Isle of Man Mountain Circuit is the world's most famous, most challenging and most dangerous roadracing course. Each year it hosts the Isle of Man TT and Festival of Motorcycling and we've come up with a small, simple card game that'll keep up to 6 people laughing and playing.</p>
<p>Every deck contains 126 cards, 60 of which represent corners and locations around the course. Each turn, players lay down cards trying to get their total number of miles up to 38: the course is 37.75 miles long (but who wants to play a game involving fractions or decimals?!).</p>
<p>Other cards can interfere with other players, making it a sneaky game of strategy. And well-known features of the racing such a mist, marshals, and even running out of fuel are all represented.</p>
<p>The idea was to come up with a fun game that can be played in 15 minutes, fit inside panniers without overloading someone's motorbike, and be simple enough to pick up over pint in the Beer Tent!</p>
<h3>So Why Not Call It ""The TT Game"" Then?</h3>
<p>In truth, we'd have loved to have done that but the letters TT have been trademarked by the Isle of Man's Department for Enterprise, and they've come down hard on people who've used the initials without their permission in the past.</p>
<p>We emailed over a few months to try to find out what this might cost so we could factor that into our campaign, but never received a reply. Rather than risk producing a game would have to be pulped on the instructions of lawyers, we decided to rename it to avoid any possible legal difficulties.</p>
<p>This is definitely <u><strong><i>not</i></strong></u>  an official TT product of any sort (so please go away, ministers / civil servants / advocates)!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need £10,000 to fund a production run of 1,000 decks. We have a manufacturer in China that can produce the cards, include an instruction sheet (in English, French and German) and put it all in a nice metal tin.</p>
<p>It means we can sell the decks for £10 each - a pretty reasonable price for a game!</p>
<p>One drawback, however, is the cost of postage from the Isle of Man - we're sorry it seems fairly high but we're stuck with the prices passed on from the Post Office. For shipping to the Isle of Man or UK, it's just over £3 per deck - but for the Europe it'll cost more than £11 per deck, and about £14 to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>If that's a little rich for your blood, our perks start at just £1 to have your name included on the instruction sheet that comes with every game - we obviously want to thank everyone who helped make this happen.</p>
<p>And if your company (or who knows, race team) really wants to get involved, you can sponsor a corner card for £100 - getting your logo or web address on that card in each deck. Think of it as the digital equivalent of hanging your banner from the Grandstand on Glencrutchery Road, or putting a sign up at Quarterbridge!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About our funding goal</h3>
<p>This is an all-or-nothing campaign. If we don't raise the money we need to pay for manufacturing and shipping, we'll call the whole thing off and everybody will get their pledge money back.</p>
<p>You'll understand we're hoping that won't happen - but we won't take money for a product that doesn't launch!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; challenges</h3>
<p>From a product point of view, we're ready to roll. We've designed the cards, produced a prototype deck and playtested extensively with friends and family before taking it out to pubs around the Isle of Man. Total strangers who had no idea how to play picked it up almost instantly!</p>
<p>But our manufacturer is in China and so shipping the crates of decks may take a little while. That's unfortunately out of our control as the cartons will be loaded onto a ship as freight and sent to the UK, from where they'll be sent to the Isle of Man before we pop them into packaging to be sent to you.</p>
<p>At the moment, we don't know how long that shipping process will take - but all things being equal, we're hoping everyone can have their decks in time for TT 2018.</p>
<p>The only other risk to the game is from foreign currency fluctuations. We'll pay the manufacturer in US dollars and so we have to cross our fingers the value of the pound doesn't collapse before we can send the money to them. That, however, seems a very small risk at present.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Buying a deck is great, and taking up our other perks would be awesome.</p>
<p>But as well as that, if you could help spread the word on <a href=""https://twitter.com/TheMountCircuit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TheMountainCircuit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, we'd be very grateful.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>By the mid-1930s, the United States was still struggling to squeeze its way out of the Great Depression. These difficult times were characterized by hunger, crime, high unemployment, major wealth inequality, limited social mobility, and political strife that tested the fortitude of the American economy.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568877568/sz41toywopf2u2pmo1fy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The government intervened, establishing new economic policies, which eventual led to reviving free market principles. By the early 1940’s it had become apparent that the US had pulled itself up by its bootstraps, restoring a stable and growing economy defined by the opportunity that a free market provides.</p>

<p><strong>This game aims to mimic the spirit of the free market: </strong>To profit by investing, selling, trading, taking risks, paying attention to market trends, anticipating opponents' strategy, cooperating with others, but also profiting from them as well, all in the spirit of making the most money.</p>

<p>The Donation Tower is an off-board element that brings the game an additional interesting value. Throughout the game, players contribute to the funds that are concealed within the tower.

</div></div>","About the Game
FREE MARKET: NYC  is a competitive and strategic board game based on the principles of a free market economy, presented from a humorous and ironic perspective of life, making it both a social and fun game!



In this game, you will find yourself managing a group of people who work together in different assignments, aiming to grow their fortune according to your vision.

Throughout the game, you will purchase merchandise at the auction, deliver goods to shops and factories, establish partnerships in shops and factories, or possibly take over other players' business and capital.  

You will also attend events, influence politics, win awards, and garner all kinds of influence to help your businesses, partnerships, and assets flourish as you move forward in the game.

The trick is simple: buy when the market is low and sell when it's high to make the most profit before your opponents do. The most successful businessman wins the game.

FREE MARKET is played with 2-5 players, ages 12+ and 90-180 minutes long. The rules booklet is in 6 languages, but the game board is completely multilingual. 






This game is not language dependent - since the game board itself is fully generic (multilingual), any player regardless of his or her language can directly play this game, after a brief explanation.
Please be aware that this is a work in progress rules booklet. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered.

3-10 players that plays in 15-30 minutes.  Players try to score the most points by forming clouds into recognizable objects and having the other players guess the shapes before time runs out.  With the ability to overlap and move the cards, you can make almost any cloud shape come to life!  Cloud Control is a game that can be taken out at family gatherings and enjoyed by all ages for years to come!   Cloud Control has been chosen as 1 of 5 finalists in Hasbro’s Next Great Family Game Challenge, and at the end of this campaign, Hasbro, along with guest judge, Shark Tank’s Daymond John, will determine the grand prize winner that will receive $25,000, a trip for 4 to Hasbro headquarters, and the opportunity to work with Hasbro.To begin the game, the cloud cards are placed in a grid in the center of the table.   On your turn, choose a shape card and study the listed shapes.  Once you are ready, the timer is flipped and you must get the other players to guess the shapes listed on your card before time runs out.  To do so, take cloud cards from the center grid and orient them to form a recognizable cloud shape.  You can turn, twist, stack and overlap the cloud cards, move and animate the cloud cards, or create anything related to the shape.  Just don't speak or make sounds!Both you and the player who guessed correctly receive points based on the difficulty level of the guessed shape, and play continues until each player has taken a turn.  The player with the most points is the winner!Cloud Control isn’t just for solo play – there are team play rules as well. Additionally, if this campaign reaches $12,000, the all-play lightning round (where all players frantically create the same cloud shape and then vote for the best one) will also be included to allow for even more ways for your family to enjoy Cloud Control!Watch the below video to see Cloud Control in action:

 
Read the full review of Cloud Control from Board Game Authority HERE:“The game is a lot of fun and caused a lot of laughs around our gaming table.”“…you might not even want to keep score because no one will want to stop playing”“Having your head in the clouds has never been so much fun.”We took Cloud Control to Unpub 6 in Baltimore, Maryland, and here are just a few of the quotes we received:""Best game I've played at Unpub so far this year.""""Fun party game!!""""The creative nature and fun aspect of the game was a high point for me.""""Fun, quick game for all""My favorite part of the game is:""The fun fast paced nature.  We were laughing constantly.""""The creativity!  The idea of animating it is really cool to me""""The creativity element and fun togetherness!!""""The creativity""""The quick motions""""Keeps everyone involved and talking which is fun.""Cloud Control will ship worldwide from fulfillment centers located in the United States, Canada and the EU, and we will be paying customs and VAT taxes and fees for supporters located within the United States, Canada and the EU.Although we are not offering ""friendly"" shipping to other areas at this time, we hope our international supporters outside of these ""friendly"" areas can coordinate pooling orders for the Cirrocumulus (4 games) or Cirrostratus (5 games) perk levels in order to save game and shipping costs.  In order to stay fiscally responsible, however, we do not believe we can offer any other ""friendly"" shipping right now.  This may change if we receive a significant number of supporters in one area, and we are already in contact with fulfillment partners in Asia and Australia to make this possible. If you are not contributing to this campaign because of shipping costs, please let us

<p><strong>I</strong> have been working in animation and illustration for the past 20 years. Almost exclusively for apps for the last four years making 2D animation and illustrations. All the apps are for children. The experience gained gave me the knowledge and the strength to start my own app. Several ideas came to me before I started this project. Attending all the apps targeted for children, I always tried to find something different. Despite the amount of responsibility involved, an educational app was not an option but a priority. I can say that the fact of being married to a teacher has left me more relaxed to face the difficulties that lay ahead. So the idea of putting together an app, a book and crafts seemed to me the best choice and the best idea to start with. Children spend so much time on their smartphones and tablets, neglecting books and crafts. With the project “I Like to Be…” children can have a cool learning experience playing with the app and spending time together with their families building creative ideas as a complement for each task accomplished. The picture book associated to the theme will provide children with relaxing moments, always digging into their imagination.</p>

<p align=""justify"">The Art of War: Card Game is a non-collectable tabletop game where you can lead one of four factions and fight for dominance in fierce card battles in which you can challenge as many as three opponents!  Four factions to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Kingdom of Etlia</strong> is a kingdom of the middle lands, which for a long time existed without wars and gave the world many literature and art masterpieces of. Its culture is known far beyond the borders of the kingdom, but the civil war made the country easy prey in the eyes of its neighbors. The self-defense units of Etlia are not so strong, but the heroes of these lands are able to inspire the troops by restoring their health and recruit additional units under their banners.</li>
<li>
<strong>Nordkönigraich </strong>is the kingdom of the north, a nation that has tempered its character in centuries of incessant wars. Artillery, battle mages and warriors of this faction can unleash all their power and fury on the enemies of the Kaiser and inflict large damage upon them, from which they can never recover.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Sarioantian Empire</strong>, which was once the most powerful nation on the continent, is now in a political crisis. Despite the shaky position and unrest in society, its new leader intends to return the empire to greatness. This faction specializes in covert operations that can leave the enemy without an army and disrupt enemy strategy before Sarioantia deploys its main forces.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Greatunion Tsardom</strong> is a religious kingdom of the east, in which the practice of magic is prohibited. However, despite the absence of magicians in the ranks of its troops, the troops of this nation are the most powerful and disciplined, and clerics give protection to soldiers from enemy magic attacks.</li>
</ul>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Non-collectible Card Game</h3>
<p>This game is non-collectible card game and you do not need to hunt for new cards. The game focuses directly on the four factions and their distinctive tactics, and not on the collectible aspect. Therefore, the game is ready to play immediately after purchase.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: right;"">Support of up to 4 players</h3>
<p>his game is intended for a larger number of players than it is customary in such games. Basically, games of this kind are designed for two players, but The Art of War can be played with up to 4 people at the same time.</p>
<h3>Social game</h3>
<p>This game is more social than other similar card games. The outcome of the game in play sessions with more than two players depends not only on the tactical abilities of the player, but also on the talent to persuade, manipulate or cooperate. Playing in “deathmatch” mode, pitting opponents against each other can mean more than good military tactics, and in “alliance” mode, the cooperation of two different factions can open the way to powerful moves and combinations.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: right;"">Reach replayability</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">There are many different modes available in the game, which can be combined with each other in order to get a rich gaming experience.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Time options: Long game and Quick game.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Game options: 1 on 1, ""Deathmatch"" for three or four players, Military alliance mode for four players.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Rule options: Classic rules, ""Iron Will"", ""Gold and Silver"". </li>
</ul>

<p align=""justify"">We are a small team from Latvia, and we have never been involved in the development of tabletop games before. It all started when the final version of the video game “Gwent: The Witcher Card Game” was released, which was completely different from the beta version.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The nostalgia of forever gone beta-Gwent inspired us to create our own game. We decided to recreate what we really loved in the old Gwent and improve other aspects that were missing in other similar games. Our game was intended to be tabletop, non-collectible and player moves should be easily and quickly calculated by the players themselves without using any additional means. And on top of that, the game should become more social and can be played with more players at the same time than comparable games like Gwent, Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh!</p>
<p align=""justify"">And in the end, we succeeded and “The Art of War” was born...</p>

</div></div>","The Art of War: Card Game is a non-collectable tabletop game where you can lead one of four factions and fight for dominance in fierce card battles in which you can challenge as many as three opponents!  Four factions to choose from:


The Kingdom of Etlia is a kingdom of the middle lands, which for a long time existed without wars and gave the world many literature and art masterpieces of. Its culture is known far beyond the borders of the kingdom, but the civil war made the country easy prey in the eyes of its neighbors. The self-defense units of Etlia are not so strong, but the heroes of these lands are able to inspire the troops by restoring their health and recruit additional units under their banners.

Nordkönigraich is the kingdom of the north, a nation that has tempered its character in centuries of incessant wars. Artillery, battle mages and warriors of this faction can unleash all their power and fury on the enemies of the Kaiser and inflict large damage upon them, from which they can never recover.

The Sarioantian Empire, which was once the most powerful nation on the continent, is now in a political crisis. Despite the shaky position and unrest in society, its new leader intends to return the empire to greatness. This faction specializes in covert operations that can leave the enemy without an army and disrupt enemy strategy before Sarioantia deploys its main forces.

The Greatunion Tsardom is a religious kingdom of the east, in which the practice of magic is prohibited. However, despite the absence of magicians in the ranks of its troops, the troops of this nation are the most powerful and disciplined, and clerics give protection to soldiers from enemy magic attacks.

 

 
Non-collectible Card Game
This game is non-collectible card game and you do not need to hunt for new cards. The game focuses directly on the four factions and their distinctive tactics, and not on the collectible aspect. Therefore, the game is ready to play immediately after purchase.
Support of up to 4 players
his game is intended for a larger number of players than it is customary in such games. Basically, games of this kind are designed for two players, but The Art of War can be played with up to 4 people at the same time.
Social game
This game is more social than other similar card games. The outcome of the game in play sessions with more than two players depends not only on the tactical abilities of the player, but also on the talent to persuade, manipulate or cooperate. Playing in “deathmatch” mode, pitting opponents against each other can mean more than good military tactics, and in “alliance” mode, the cooperation of two different factions can open the way to powerful moves and combinations.
Reach replayability
There are many different modes available in the game, which can be combined with each other in order to get a rich gaming experience.

Time options: Long game and Quick game.
Game options: 1 on 1, ""Deathmatch"" for three or four players, Military alliance mode for four players.
Rule options: Classic rules, ""Iron Will"", ""Gold and Silver"". 


We are a small team from Latvia, and we have never been involved in the development of tabletop games before. It all started when the final version of the video game “Gwent: The Witcher Card Game” was released, which was completely different from the beta version.
The nostalgia of forever gone beta-Gwent inspired us to create our own game. We decided to recreate what we really loved in the old Gwent and improve other aspects that were missing in other similar games. Our game was intended to be tabletop, non-collectible and player moves should be easily and quickly calculated by the players themselves without using any additional means. And on top of that, the game should become more social and can be played with more players at the same time than comparable games like Gwent, Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh!
And in the end, we succeeded and “The Art of War” was born...

GAME MODES
Three different game modes are available (for playing with up to 4 players)

Classical mode for two players.
Deathmatch mode for three or four players.
Alliances mode for four players.

 

 
FACTIONS

4 factions to choose from: Kingdom of Etlia, Nordkönigraich, Sarioantian Empire, Greatunion Tsardom.
Each faction has 19 faction cards.
At the beginning of every game each player needs to choose 10 cards that will make up their Faction Reserve - a deck that can only be used by the player controlling a specific faction.

 

 
COMMON DECK

All players have access to the Common Deck.
The common deck consists only of iron cards (cards of the lowest value).
The size of the common deck depends on the number of players - from 20 to 40 cards (10 cards per player).

 

 
TURNS

Each player rolls a 6-sided die.
The player who rolls the most points goes first.
During his turn, the player must either play one card from his hand and perform its effect or pass.
Player moves are passed clockwise. Each player can place cards in two rows under their control.
The round continues until every player has no cards in their hand to play or declares pass.
The player who declared pass does not play a card this round, but the effects of cards already set on the board continue to apply.

 

 
END OF THE GAME

When every player has passed, the number of health points for each player is calculated. The player with the most health points is the winner of the round.
The game lasts until two wins, so winning the first round might not be as important as keeping key cards for later rounds.
After the first round, players draw one card from their Faction Reserve and two from the Common Deck.
If the second round turns out to be a draw, then an additional third round is played, and all players draw two cards.

 
If the third round has not revealed a winner (which is extremely rare), a series of blitz rounds is assigned.
 

 

The game is designed for 2-4 players. Each player chooses a faction they are going to represent and takes 10 cards of his choice from the deck of that faction. Those 10 cards will form a deck which is called the Faction Reserve. Depending on the number of players, in the same way, randomly, from 20 to 40 common cards are taken - this deck will be called the Common deck.

A player must win two rounds to win the game.

<h2>CAMPAIGN</h2>
<p>This deck has already been successfully funded on Kickstarter and we are now entering the second phase of production and taking pre-orders! The deck will be ready for delivery in March 2019! All tiers also come with a handy ""Guide to the Moon Crystal Tarot""!</p>
<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>I grew up watching Sailor Moon as a child and teenager and was always enamoured by the great individual strengths of the characters and the journey of Usagi Tsukino. Growing up I also became attracted to the Tarot, especially the over aching archetypes of the Major Arcana which can repeatedly be found in various religions, cultures and psychological theories. I wanted to link all these things together by creating a special Sailor Moon-themed Tarot. This led to the creation to the Moon Crystal Tarot (Major Arcana) which was successfully funded in 2018 via Kickstarter. The overwhelming response pushed me to start working on the rest of the cards. Attributing characters to card meaning and illustrating 56 more cards was by no means an easy feat, but I am proud to say that after a year's worth of work (and some figure drawing assistance from SenshiStock) I can finally bring you the full Moon Crystal Tarot. </p>
<h2>CARDS</h2>
<p>The cards will be professionally printed in Italy on 330gsm triplex Casino quality board which is easy to shuffle and resistant to wear. The cards will be varnished for extra durability. </p>
<p>The pack features 78 cards measuring 65x115cm and will come in a full colour casket style cardboard box with gold foil detailing. Package upgrades are also available and will be hand screen printed by myself in my Berlin workshop.</p>

In fact, you can learn right now! It works like this:The dealer picks up a Question card and reads the letters at the top aloud:Everyone else grabs two of each Answer card that match the requirements at the top (in this case, 2 A's, 2 B's, 2 C's).The dealer reads the question and everyone must use the cards in their hands to form a funny phrase, discarding the cards they did not choose. Then, the dealer asks the question to each player, who must then read their phrase out loud.But wait! There's one more twist! Before everyone reads their answers, the dealer picks up a Rule card, which will feature some wacky rule that everyone must follow for that round. This could range from
Talking in accents
Swapping cards with other players
Changing the question completely
Trying not to laugh
And many more!
And that's about it! Read the full rules or even download a black & white version of Cheer Up! for free, right now!""This was great, I loved it, I thought it was so fun!"" - Beer and Board Games ""A really silly game...definitely one to bring out at your parties."" - Let's Level Up""The additional opportunity for creativity is most welcome...a worthy way to begin or end a game night."" - Game Theory""Simple but hilarious...we'll definitely be on the lookout."" - The Lifecast""I have a permanent wheeze from laughing so hard."" - Natalie, an unfortunate playtester""I'm not saying this word."" - Chris' Auntphoto courtesy of The Lifecast  ""Wait a minute, I've played party games before,"" you say, in our imagination, ""What's so great about this one?"" Glad you asked! There are three main things that set Cheer Up! apart from other party card games. We've conveniently laid them out here like a good boy: All the cards in Cheer Up! are written for you, but in this game you get to take credit for your creative jokes. The cards give you some helpful puzzle pieces and your job is to put all the pieces together. Sometimes this will result in crazy nonsense. But, when paired with the right card, a benign word can skyrocket to extreme ridiculousness, and you get to own it, baby.There are also a handful of cards that require a little bit of advanced strategy, such as the A card ""Every."" It won't always make sense on it's own, but when paired with a great B it can work wonders.After multiple sessions of Cheer Up! you will likely run across the same cards, just like in any other game. However, due to the number of possible combinations, we can guarantee that no two games will ever be the same. In fact, you may never play the same combos again. Even though answer cards are recycled, it's the combination of the answers, plus the question, plus the rule that changes the context completely. If the maximum of 5 cards are used in a round, you're looking at a 1 in like...40 kablillion chance of having the exact situation come up again. We didn't do the math, but it's big.For example, in Round 1, you might get the question ""What's the worst that could happen?""

<p>Story</p>
<p>The Torshn Puzzle is a surprisingly difficult challenge and an alluring addition to your desk, shelf, or coffee table.</p>
<p>The objective is simple– align the colors to each other by sliding the marbles and twisting the halves. Solving the puzzle may initially seem straightforward, but you’ll quickly find that it’s trickier than it looks! </p>
<p>The dichotomy between simplicity and complexity is what makes the Torshn Puzzle a special puzzle for people of all ages and backgrounds. While an 11-year-old may not have a fully developed brain, she does not have the hindering ego of a 30-year-old college grad. While the working adult may have the spatial awareness and problem solving skills to manipulate the puzzle more efficiently, they may not have the patience and perseverance of a retired grandma with time to kill. Everyone that has picked up the Torshn Puzzle thus far has had a completely different approach to solving it and unique challenges specific to their personality and skillset. </p>
<p>Like the Rubik’s cube and the original orb puzzle, the Torshn Puzzle is complex enough to be fun after multiple solves. However, it is simple enough that it is approachable. You don't need to discover or memorize a bunch of fancy algorithms to solve the Torshn Puzzle, but it sure does help if you do.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p>In a world that increasingly fills your mind with clutter, it’s important to take a step back and focus your energy into a single objective. The Torshn puzzle is a simple challenge yet requires your undivided attention. We’ve found that playing with the Torshn Puzzle allows us to reduce stress and increase our productivity in other aspects of life. It stimulates, yet eases our minds simultaneously.</p>
<p>The origins of puzzles go back as far as 2300 BC when Ancient Greeks and Egyptians developed and solved labyrinths. Since then, puzzles have grown and evolved into countless shapes and forms. However, the physical and mental benefits of puzzle solving remain all the same.</p>
<p>Puzzles exercise the left and right sides of the brain simultaneously. They’re a mental workout that improves problem-solving skills and attention span. Doing puzzles reinforces connections between brain cells, improves mental speed, and is an especially effective way to improve short-term memory.  It’s no surprise that Bill Gates is an avid puzzler!</p>
<p>Being a three-dimensional challenge, the Torshn puzzle promotes the development of a wider perception to the process of problem solving. It requires spatial awareness and memory, as not all of the spheres are visible simultaneously. Playing with the puzzle develops finger-eye coordination and requires dexterity to reposition the spheres efficiently. Perhaps most important of all, patience and perseverance are also necessary because it's trickier than it looks!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are more than seven hundred thousand different possible ways for the colors to be arranged, and only 6 different combinations that leave the puzzle solved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This journey began as a design exploration of the sphericon but quickly became a consuming pursuit to make the greatest puzzle that we could. We wanted to create a unique, forever lasting, and beautiful puzzle that anybody could enjoy and play with.</p>
<p>We know that design must embody purpose– that every aspect of a design must consciously add to its whole. We wanted to make something breathtaking but also ergonomic and simple.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We combined form and function to achieve these three goals:</p>
<p>A design that could easily fit into a museum</p>
<p>A challenge not too difficult for anyone, but tricky enough to be interesting and replayable</p>
<p>A puzzle built with exceptional quality and in a way that would last forever.<br/> </p>
<p>We drew inspiration from a puzzle we grew up playing with– the Orb Puzzle invented by Christopher C. Wiggs and Christopher J. Taylor in 1981.</p>
<p>After months of design, brainstorming, and prototyping, we landed on utilizing the continuous face of a sphericon as cavities for spheres to move along. This allows for extremely smooth and simple movement of the pieces, something that the Orb Puzzle lacked.</p>
<p>The dimensions of the Torshn Puzzle was a challenge to perfect. Larger cavities and spheres made the puzzle easier to work with, but created less visually harmonious proportions. Smaller cavities and more spheres were prettier and closer resembled the original Orb Puzzle, but resulted in a puzzle that was more difficult to solve and difficult to manipulate smoothly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We played with and tested over 50 iterations of the puzzle. With each puzzle, we fine tuned every curve, track, and divet by as little as a quarter of a millimeter to a develop a puzzle that is as sturdy as a rock, pretty to look at, and graceful to handle.</p>
<p>Longevity is extremely important to us. We despise how unsustainable plastic is. We wanted to create something that would last forever– something that will be passed on for generations to come and won’t end up in a landfill somewhere. We wanted something that had little chance of breaking and would be repairable if it did. So we knew the final product would be constructed from a sustainable metal body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When we made our first metal prototype, we were blown away. It became a sculpture that you can play with. Steel was too heavy and titanium was too expensive. We decided on anodized aluminum– sturdy yet lightweight.</p>
<p>It’s not cheap to mill from a solid chunk of metal, but after considering countless different manufacturing methods, it’s the only way to make the best Torshn Puzzle that we can. Metal construction allows us to achieve the strict tolerances required for the puzzle to spin smoothly while being everlasting. It also doesn’t hurt that aluminum is the most abundant metal on the planet and 100% recyclable! +1 for sustainability.</p>
<p>It took us a while to perfect the finish– we wanted something that was smooth to the touch and beautiful to look at under all lights. We tried brushed, coated, polished, but ultimately landed on anodized and finely sandblasted. We think that the result is breathtaking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re a team of tinkerers and makers with over 15 years of combined experience in industrial design and contract manufacturing. We share a passion for puzzles of all kinds, and want to share our personal creations with the world. Torshn Design is the product of us being tired of working on projects that we lacked autonomy over. Our goal is to create puzzles that are unique, mind-tickling, and forever-lasting. We’re a small team located in Oakland, California, and we’re excited to embark on this journey with you! </p>
<p>Why support our campaign?</p>
<p>You or someone you know loves puzzles<br/> </p>
<p>You like conversation starters and desk art<br/> </p>
<p>You need a stress-relieving escape from everyday life<br/> </p>
<p>You have a child and you know that puzzles are one of the greatest tools for their development<br/> </p>
<p>You want to keep your brain sharp and prevent early onset of diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia<br/> </p>
<p>You’re fascinated by rare mathematical shapes<br/> </p>
<p> You want to support designers who are truly passionate about the product they build<br/> </p>
<p>You hate unsustainable products made by conglomerates and want to put your money where your mouth is by helping small creators bring their ideas to life (ok that was a little bit specific...)<br/> </p>
<p>The design is finished, the manufacturing process is solidified, and we’re so excited to share the Torshn Puzzle with the world. We need your help to make our first production run and bring it to life.</p>
<p>Below is a table that represents what our estimated shipping costs are for the Torshn Puzzle. Your pledge does not include shipping and you will pay for shipping AFTER the campaign ends. We are handling shipping this way to get backers the lowest possible shipping price. We don't want to unnecessarily over-charge for shipping. These are estimated costs based on an average range of shipping quotes we've attained from different carriers and may change depending on our final results. We believe we have a pretty efficient solution for US backers (shipping directly from our studio) but are still working on finding even better solutions for international backers (more fulfillment centers). Please keep in mind that the Torshn Puzzle is heavy and the shipping costs reflect its weight.</p>
<p>After the campaign ends, we will be sending you a BackerKit.com survey which will securely process your color choice, address, and shipping payment which will hopefully be lower than quoted below.</p>
<p>We plan to optimize distribution efficiency and minimize emissions by working with fulfillment partners in multiple countries, rather than shipping each individual package out from our studio. Regardless, please know that we are trying our best to optimize shipping so that everyone can receive the Torshn Puzzle at an affordable rate. Our goal is to make this process as transparent and accurate as possible, without any false promises or unexpected changes.</p>
<p>This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.</p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>Production Our manufacturing process is set in stone, and we’ve partnered up with an extremely experienced factory to bring each Torshn Puzzle to life. They’ve brought great expertise to the table and have been a pleasure to work with. However, in our years of experience in manufacturing and bringing designs to mass production, we’ve learned that seldom does a project go from start to finish without behind-the-scenes roadblocks. We have the experience to deal with that. We’ve mapped out every scenario we can think of to avoid any surprises. However, if anything unexpected does arise, we promise to be 100% transparent with our backers– communication is of utmost importance to us. We believe that great communication builds great relationships and therefore great trust. We look forward to embarking on this journey together! Shipping &amp; Logistics Along with rising shipping costs in the last decade, the pandemic has only made logistics more expensive. Especially with the weight of the Torshn Puzzle, we have been quoted higher shipping costs than we would have seen before. We believe we have a pretty efficient solution for US backers but are still working on finding even better solutions for international backers. We want everyone around the world to be able to enjoy the puzzle. Regardless, please know that we are trying our best to optimize shipping so everyone can receive the Torshn Puzzle at an affordable rate.</p>

<p>Long-lasting design</p>
<p>From the very beginning, we set out to make a puzzle that would last virtually forever– an heirloom that can be passed on from generation to generation. Mechanism: We designed the Torshn Puzzle to be as simple as possible to avoid any complications over time. The cavities through which the marbles move are milled from a solid chunk of aluminum. The precision and smoothness of the cavities prevent the marbles from getting worn down, and the sturdiness of the cavities themselves mean that they won't get eroded by glass marbles either. The spinning mechanism of the Torshn Puzzle is made possible by rare earth neodymium magnets, which are permanent magnets and only lose a fraction of their performance every 100 years. Material: We chose Anodized aluminum because it is extremely sturdy and will not degrade over time. It is more durable, wear resistant, and more life-proof than any wood or plastic alternative.</p>
<p>Reusability and recyclability</p>
<p>Aluminum is the only metal that can be recycled an infinite number of times, as it does not degrade during the recycling process. Although our packaging isn't set in stone, we plan to use either cork, hemp, or recycled paper to keep the Torshn Puzzle safe in transit rather than bubblewrap or packing peanuts. Plastic sucks. We also designed the Torshn Puzzle to be easily repairable if anything ever goes wrong. The marbles, magnets, and rotational axis are all easily replaceable if broken or lost.</p>
<p>Sustainable materials</p>
<p>As we've stated before, aluminum is lightweight, strong, and highly recyclable. It is one of the only materials out there that can be recycled an infinite number of times, as it does not degrade during the recycling process.</p>
<p>Sustainable Distribution</p>
<p>We plan to optimize distribution efficiency and minimize emissions by working with fulfillment partners in multiple countries, rather than shipping each individual package out from our studio.</p>

You or someone you know loves puzzles 
You like conversation starters and desk art 
You need a stress-relieving escape from everyday life 
You have a child and you know that puzzles are one of the greatest tools for their development 
You want to keep your brain sharp and prevent early onset of diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia 
You’re fascinated by rare mathematical shapes 
 You want to support designers who are truly passionate about the product they build 
You hate unsustainable products made by conglomerates and want to put your money where your mouth is by helping small creators bring their ideas to life (ok that was a little bit specific...) 
The design is finished, the manufacturing process is solidified, and we’re so excited to share the Torshn Puzzle with the world. We need your help to make our first production run and bring it to life.
Below is a table that represents what our estimated shipping costs are for the Torshn Puzzle. Your pledge does not include shipping and you will pay for shipping AFTER the campaign ends. We are handling shipping this way to get backers the lowest possible shipping price. We don't want to unnecessarily over-charge for shipping. These are estimated costs based on an average range of shipping quotes we've attained from different carriers and may change depending on our final results. We believe we have a pretty efficient solution for US backers (shipping directly from our studio) but are still working on finding even better solutions for international backers (more fulfillment centers). Please keep in mind that the Torshn Puzzle is heavy and the shipping costs reflect its weight.
After the campaign ends, we will be sending you a BackerKit.com survey which will securely process your color choice, address, and shipping payment which will hopefully be lower than quoted below.
We plan to optimize distribution efficiency and minimize emissions by working with fulfillment partners in multiple countries, rather than shipping each individual package out from our studio. Regardless, please know that we are trying our best to optimize shipping so that everyone can receive the Torshn Puzzle at an affordable rate. Our goal is to make this process as transparent and accurate as possible, without any false promises or unexpected changes.
This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.
Risks and challenges
Production Our manufacturing process is set in stone, and we’ve partnered up with an extremely experienced factory to bring each Torshn Puzzle to life. They’ve brought great expertise to the table and have been a pleasure to work with. However, in our years of experience in manufacturing and bringing designs to mass production, we’ve learned that seldom does a project go from start to finish without behind-the-scenes roadblocks. We have the experience to deal with that. We’ve mapped out every scenario we can think of to avoid any surprises. However, if anything unexpected does arise, we promise to be 100% transparent with our backers– communication is of utmost importance to us. We believe that great communication builds great relationships and therefore great trust. We look forward to embarking on this journey together! Shipping & Logistics Along with rising shipping costs in the last decade, the pandemic has only made logistics more expensive. Especially with the weight of the Torshn Puzzle, we have been quoted higher shipping costs than we would have seen before. We believe we have a pretty efficient solution for US backers but are still working on finding even better solutions for international backers. We want everyone around the world to be able to enjoy the puzzle. Regardless, please know that we are trying our best to optimize shipping so everyone can receive the Torshn Puzzle at an affordable rate.

Long-lasting design
From the very beginning, we set out to make a puzzle that would last virtually forever– an heirloom that can be passed on from generation to generation. Mechanism: We designed the Torshn Puzzle to be as simple as possible to avoid any complications over time. The cavities through which the marbles move are milled from a solid chunk of aluminum. The precision and smoothness of the cavities prevent the marbles from getting worn down, and the sturdiness of the cavities themselves mean that they won't get eroded by glass marbles either. The spinning mechanism of the Torshn Puzzle is made possible by rare earth neodymium magnets, which are permanent magnets and only lose a fraction of their performance every 100 years. Material: We chose Anodized aluminum because it is extremely sturdy and will not degrade over time. It is more durable, wear resistant, and more life-proof than any wood or plastic alternative.
Reusability and recyclability
Aluminum is the only metal that can be recycled an infinite number of times, as it does not degrade during the recycling process. Although our packaging isn't set in stone, we plan to use either cork, hemp, or recycled paper to keep the Torshn Puzzle safe in transit rather than bubblewrap or packing peanuts. Plastic sucks. We also designed the Torshn Puzzle to be easily repairable if anything ever goes wrong. The marbles, magnets, and rotational axis are all easily replaceable if broken or lost.
Sustainable materials
As we've stated before, aluminum is lightweight, strong, and highly recyclable. It is one of the only materials out there that can be recycled an infinite number of times, as it does not degrade during the recycling process.
Sustainable Distribution
We plan to optimize distribution efficiency and minimize emissions by working with fulfillment partners in multiple countries, rather than shipping each individual package out from our studio.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>It is said that the Chimeras would throw their cubs into an abyss as a test, for only the strongest ones would emerge. That is a lie and completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>Our story is one of hardship and misery but also of heroism. The Three, as We are commonly know, hail from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>The Sketcher, comes from the scorching deserts of Arabia. Banished from His homeland, the constant fight against thirst, sun, boredom, and the fact that He couldn't speak Arabic, forced Him to find different ways to communicate with the natives. He only knew how to draw camels, which either made the natives point Him to other camels, or just moved away, for His interest in camels was strange. As such, He had to develop better drawing skills as to express Himself, and find His way home. It is said that His drawing of a camel with wings was so good, that it made someone give Him directions to the airport, at long last.</p>
<p>The Taskmaster, comes from the legendary land of explorers, discoverers of the world as we know it. Portugal. Living in a poor, coastal area near the capital, He had to develop skills as to get by, scrounging whatever resources He could. Other poor souls would listen to Him, either to ask things to try and learn from Him and as such, The Taskmaster soon realized ""Why work if i can force others to do my bidding?"". Now that He had the means, He turned His gaze into the capital. For years has it mocked Him, with restaurants and better public transportation. But no more...</p>
<p>The Unfathomable, a survivor from lost Atlantis. Not much is known of Him, nor His reasons. Some say He has untold knowledge, some say He is the harbinger of the end times, others say He left His homeland because someone shared spoilers of His favorite movie before it even got to the theaters there. Be it as it may, when asked about it, He speaks in His ancient ways of speaking and accent. The man remains a mystery because everybody just nods and leaves without understanding a word He said. Seriously, His accent is just weird.</p>
<p>Fate was set in motion for The Three, mighty as They were, would soon find each other. The Taskmaster felt that the knowledge that The Unfathomable held could be of use to Him, but not knowing how to speak His language, asked The Sketcher to use His legendary skill of turning anything spoken into a drawing of a camel as translation. The Unfathomable was in awe as He saw the drawing and, to everyone's surprise, He wrote in the drawing a thing that changed everyhing:</p>
<p>""What does the camel mean?""</p>
<p>They realized They could now easily communicate and set in motion the plans that everyone really wanted... To offer the world the best most brutal card game possible.</p>

<div>Unicorns and Zombies is the highly anticipated turn-based card game that is making its way to the masses. The game is a combination of humor, beautifully creative graphic art, multi-layered strategic options, and a cast of crazy characters.

<h3>About the project - Aadarsh Gaon game</h3>
<p>Inspired by rural village life in North India, this cooperative board game provides a way for players to build an ideal community or '<strong>Aadarsh Gaon</strong>' through social problem-solving. The safe, risk-free setting brings players together to work as a team, think critically, and form strategies.</p>
<p>We are a team of researchers, students and volunteers from Amrita University who have been working on solutions for inclusive empowerment. We have spent a significant amount of time with the disadvantaged communities to understand the issues that hamper meaningful community engagement. And from our research and fieldwork, we found that serious games, especially board games like these, can make a huge, positive difference in their lives. This game-based approach has made our initiatives more constructive, relevant and meaningful. Players become active problem solvers in the community. They become champions.</p>
<p>So with your help, we can reach out to more individuals and communities who need games like Aadarsh Gaon.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528667987/ldns6jzp2nm9iyksu1kg.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Capital Gains Studio has designed and published over a dozen games, both in-house and for corporate customers and individuals and we are confident that our team has a solid grasp on the process of designing, developing, manufacturing and delivering high quality tabletop games.

However, we are confident of delivering by the stated dateline.</p>
<p>Due to the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19 on international freight services, the shipping rates may be adjusted to reflect a possible spike in shipping rates though we will try as much as possible to absorb small increases in shipping rates.</p>

</div></div>","Dirty Money is a strategic card game where players take on the role of criminals and corrupted politicians, trying to launder dirty money using artwork and businesses, while evading detection from government agencies. Set in the same universe of Debtzilla, you now get to play the roles of the Villains and Dirty Money features fan favorite villains such as Loan Shark and Corruption Rat. Every turn plays fast!You decide on a location to visit, collect the dirty money your organization has made and decide how to turn them into businesses and artwork. While this is going on, you need to be forward thinking, planning the types of currencies to be collected and what combinations of assets to buy in order to earn the most amount of points. In the meantime, you have to be careful of not hoarding too much dirty money as other players will be whistleblowing to the cops and unleashing them onto you, causing you to earn blacklist points which will lower your final score. Are you able to keep up a front of an upright businessman while trying to get rid of those ill-gotten gains as fast as possible? The game is designed by internationally acclaimed Singaporean board game designer Daryl Chow (Overbooked, The Artemis Project, Remember Our Trip, Ramen Ink etc), and illustrated by top Singaporean comic artist, Alan Bay (Sacred Legend, Once Upon a Singapore Traders etc). Harnessing the strength of Singapore's top talents, Dirty Money promises to be a treat, mentally and visually.  Lion City Hideout Pack features famous spots in Singapore which you can use to replace the locations in the base set. These items will not be available in retail so grab them during the Kickstarter Campaign! 

    


 
If you want to give Dirty Money a try, you can visit our Tabletopia link! Note that the cards may not be the same as the final product as it is still work in progress! 

 





 
Check Out! The Convenience Store Game is produced by Mercat Games, designed by the same brains behind Capital Gains Studio. Instead of finance themed games, they have unleashed their creativity on Asian themed games. Check Out! comes with the Pandemic Protection Pack which was only available during its pre-order campaign and this Kickstarter. Limited copies only!

Other than Dirty Money, you can check out the published games by Capital Gains Studio and get a copy of them via the ""Dirty Money + Check Out!"" and ""Master of Finance"" pledge tier. If you wish to add a single copy of any of the game to your pledge, just add the amount below and we will advice you on the adjusted shipping charges on optional add-ons.




​US & EU FRIENDLY SHIPPING
This project is US-Friendly and EU-Friendly, and therefore no additional charges or fees will apply due to taxes or customs. If you do come across issues on tax and custom fees, do drop us an email and we will take care of it.
Capital Gains Studio will be subsidizing a large portion of the shipping cost as a promotion for our campaign. We also reserve the right to decline any shipping to countries with an active armed conflict or a country with a high chance of non-delivery. We will refund any pledge made in this case after a review with our logistics partners.
The expected delivery date of Dirty Money is July 2021.

Capital Gains Studio is a Singapore-based tabletop publisher, best known for publishing finance focused games. We aspire to create games that explore various aspects of finance, while creating games with great mechanics and artwork. Our games, Cryptocurrency and Debtzilla have won top awards at Serious Play International. We have also worked with government agencies, multi-national corporations and individuals to help them design and publish tabletop games to engage and educate their stakeholders. The same team set up Mercat Games with the aim of publishing games for the Asian families, with Check Out! The Convenience Store Game as our first game. Mercat Games also aspires to help Asian designers publish games with strong Asian influence.
Daryl Chow is a globally acclaimed and award-winning board game designer with extensive international experience and networks in the board game industry. In 2018, he launched two successful Kickstarter campaigns, The Artemis Project, that reached over USD $120,000 in funding, and Overbooked, which has been licensed in many languages with tens of thousands of copies sold worldwide.
Alan Bay (Smallguydoodle) is Singapore's top independent artist who works on comics, board games and illustrations. His comic book 'Once Upon A Singapore... Traders' had been nominated for Singapore Book Award 2019. His latest comic book Sacred Legends, was recently launched on Aug 2020.

Variable player powers and game-changing events mean that every game is as different as the planets in our galaxy! 

Supports Multiple Play Styles: Based on who is playing, Stellar Leap can be semi-cooperative, really aggressive, or somewhere in between and you can win by playing in any of those ways. 

Custom Game Length: Change the play time easily by increasing or decreasing the number of events to complete the game.

Player Choice Matters: Choose your player power and hidden trait to help support your specific strategy, designate which planets and asteroids to place where they'll benefit you the most, and choose when the game ends by either causing events to trigger or avoiding them.

AI Variants: Experience the galaxy of Stellar Leap against a variety of opponents on your own or add an AI to your two player games to simulate the three or four player game.

If you'd like us to add another language, please tell us! 

 
You can download the black and white, non graphical Print and Play here Check out Stellar Leap on Tabletopia: stellarleap.space/tabletopiaAt the start of your turn, roll two dice. Choose between your unique Species Dice Power and the shared Universal Power to change the dice to what will benefit you the most.  Planets now generate resources if they are in the columns matching the die values and the sum of the die values (up to three columns). Every player with at least one population on any planet located in the matching columns receives the resources noted on the planet card.The four resources are fuel, water, food, and oxygen. Food and water are used to grow your population, fuel and oxygen are used to move around the galaxy, and all of them are used to complete missions to help those who need it. Next is the Action Phase! You get to perform two High Command Actions, activate any of your three Divisions, and move about the galaxy as you wish. The High Command actions include: increasing your population, discovering a new planet or asteroid, taxing to gain resources, and attacking your opponents to gain control of a planet. There are three Divisions at your disposal: Mining, which mines asteroids, Labor, which gains resources, and Intelligence, which completes missions.  Events are triggered by player actions during regular gameplay. In the case below, an entire solar system has been discovered! Events can be good or bad, instant or ongoing until the next event, and they're typically better for the player that triggered the event. Gameplay continues until six events are triggered, then players get an equal number of turns and the game is over! When the game ends, players tally up their scores by adding up their prestige gained from completing missions, their player board achievements, and from their no longer hidden trait. You can read the full Gameosity review here!  You can read the full Board Gaming FTW review here! You can view Eric's full review here! You can read Jeremy's full review here!You can read Derek's full review here! You can read David's full review here!You can view Board Game Spotlight's full review here!

One Copy of Stellar Leap
One Copy of Stellar Leap and One Copy of Stellar Leap: Frontiers 
One Copy of Stellar Leap and One Copy of Stellar Leap: Frontiers, plus a Custom Home Planet. You determine the color and name of this planet. Planet names can only be 7-26 characters, depending on the characters. 
One Copy of Stellar Leap and One Copy of Stellar Leap: Frontiers Frontiers, plus your name or pseudonym as the discoverer of a Planet! 
All reward levels include the HQ Digital Print & Play File. If you'd like the HQ Digital Print & Play File for the Stellar Leap: Frontiers Expansion, add $4 to your pledge. To add an add-on to your pledge, click the Manage Your Pledge button, click the Change Your Pledge button, then update the pledge amount to add either an additional $20 for every custom planet you would like or $42 for an additional game of Stellar Leap. You can watch the full Chit Chat review here! Stellar Leap: Frontiers adds another layer to the base Stellar Leap game and it's made for those who want to explore all reaches of the galaxy! It consists of resource focused planets, diverse asteroids, events that can either give or take away your available options, and traits that are more challenging than those in the base game, but that can seriously pay off, if you make the right choices! The expansion also adds a new type of card: Solar System Completion Bonuses. These allow the player who completed a solar system to change that system in a significant manner. The expansion isn't large, but it's definitely significant! Stellar Leap: Frontiers is suggested for those who want to explore the farthest frontiers of Stellar Leap.  Expansion Contents:  
12 new Planet and Asteroids Cards
6 Event Cards  
8 Trait Cards
10 Solar System Completion Bonus Cards
 You can read the full Board Game Spotlight review here. People sometimes wonder why they should back instead of waiting to get the game later in retail. The most important reason not to wait with Stellar Leap is that we currently have no plans to put this game into distribution. If you wait, you may end up missing out as we won’t have many extra copies to sell and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won’t be carrying it either. 
Subsidized Shipping – We’re giving free shipping to the US, $10 to the EU and Canada and $15 to everyone else. We’re going to pay for the rest of the shipping costs. 
EU Friendly – copies will be sent from inside the EU to avoid VAT fees for backers. 
Most importantly, without you, Stellar Leap would not get created. We definitely appreciate every backer’s support in making our dream a reality.We would love to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of Stellar Leap to retailers during the campaign.

We are working with several fulfillment partners to get Stellar Leap to you the proper way; Gamesquest for the EU, Snakes & Lattes for Canada, Aetherworks for Australia, and VFI Asia for all of Asia. We will personally be shipping out copies from the United States.  To order a second copy of Stellar Leap, add an additional $42 to your pledge with no additional shipping cost.  I am happy to discuss group orders larger than two copies, but these need to be handled on a country by country basis. Please send me a direct message including country and number of copies to discuss.Stellar Leap is the second project of Weird Giraffe Games. Super Hack Override was our first project and it was delivered a month early to backers in March 2017. Weird Giraffe Games was founded to create games that are easy to learn and play, but layered with strategy.Our team is made of the following people:

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>About 3 months ago, we realized that the other stores selling “offensive” content didn’t know shit about what it truly means. We were tired of seeing the same old barely offensive, unoriginal t-shirt with swear words on it as the only “offensive” product that you could buy online, so we decided to make our own products. We were also sick of seeing the big Tech companies censor the content and products on their platforms, so we made a store for all the believers in free speech.

<br/>The Impact</h2>
<p><br/>We’re a group of friends who saw a rise in censorship over what might be considered offensive by people, especially coming from the Left of the political isle. We’ve seen products being banned or taken hostage from Amazon and other retailers and we thought we could do something about it.  After spending months imagining, creating and figuring logistic, we arrived at the conclusion that it was going to be hard to start production without resorting to a crowdfunding platform, so here we are. We want to create original offensive products. Not the very boring t-shirts you can buy with “offensive” or vulgar words written on it. We want to create real products that have value, depth and originality. We have a full backlog of products that are ready to be launched but we need your help. We want to make our products cheap so that you can laugh with your friends and hopefully trigger your enemies at a reasonable price. Your help means that we can start the production of our various other offensive board games, offensive beverages, office and home supplies and customizable offensive products. For now, we need to have our production done by asian slaves, but rest assured that our ideas are totally developed by cis-white males. Our ultimate goal is to move production to America where we can employ Gender Studies graduates to have their tears bless our products during production.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
About 3 months ago, we realized that the other stores selling “offensive” content didn’t know shit about what it truly means. We were tired of seeing the same old barely offensive, unoriginal t-shirt with swear words on it as the only “offensive” product that you could buy online, so we decided to make our own products. We were also sick of seeing the big Tech companies censor the content and products on their platforms, so we made a store for all the believers in free speech. Here at The Offensive Store, we only use he or she pronouns and we definitely do not care about your feelings.

What We Need & What You Get
The funds will 100% be used to produce the Deport Who? Board game and its expansions (Impeach Who? & Audit Who?). All profit will be directly reinvested to the production of our other products in order for them to be available for purchases as soon as possible.
Deport Who? includes 2 game trays, 4 double-sided character sheets (2 for each game tray), 2 selectors and instructions for 2 players. Adult assembly required. Depending on the success of the campaign, we plan on making these two card expansion packs available.

In any case, we have reached out to companies that are well-known in the board game and miniatures industry for the production of Memory Decompression.

<p><strong>The Butcher’s Guild: The Bloody Master</strong></p>
<p><i>“You’re just meat to them. Weak, tender, soft meat. And they’re the Butchers.” </i></p>
<p align=""right"" style=""margin-left:18.0pt;""><i>— Greyscales, Fishermen’s Guild</i><br/> </p>
<p>Tougher than gristle, Ox sees Guild Ball as nothing but brutal bloodsport. More merciless maniac than athlete, the master butcher has transformed the pitch into a kitchen nightmare—cleavers, knives, hooks, you name it, his team wields it. Why the cutlery? Because to this deranged butcher, everyone—even his teammates—is a succulent meatbag, crying out for pain.</p>
<p>His team’s playstyle is simple: get to the opposing team and shred flesh until there’s nothing left.

<p>Inheritor of the Master Butcher’s throne, Fillet is one of the deadliest individuals throughout the Empire. A peerless duellist, she delights in playing with her opponents; dancing around them as she cuts bloody strips out of their exposed skin before bleeding them dry when she grows bored.</p>
<p>Like any Butcher team, Fillet’s side will punish their opponents mercilessly – but more frightening still is the command they hold over the pitch. Defensive players dominate the opposition, dragging the enemy around ruthlessly before the more aggressive players utilize unexpected bursts of speed. This team will allow coaches to really take the fight to their opponents.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to this Indiegogo community-driven campaign to bring the iconic legacy teams to the brand new PVC material.
By supporting this Indiegogo project, you will receive the following:

The Butcher's Guild: The Bloody Master in PVC6 Players, 1 Terrain Piece, 1 Goal, 1 Ball

The Butcher's Guild: The Scarlet Circle in PVC6 Players, 1 Terrain Piece, 1 Goal, 1 Ball

12 Exclusive Alt. Art Cards - with unique artwork for the iconic Butcher's Captain Ox.



The Butcher’s Guild: The Bloody Master
“You’re just meat to them. Weak, tender, soft meat. And they’re the Butchers.” 
— Greyscales, Fishermen’s Guild 
Tougher than gristle, Ox sees Guild Ball as nothing but brutal bloodsport. More merciless maniac than athlete, the master butcher has transformed the pitch into a kitchen nightmare—cleavers, knives, hooks, you name it, his team wields it. Why the cutlery? Because to this deranged butcher, everyone—even his teammates—is a succulent meatbag, crying out for pain.
His team’s playstyle is simple: get to the opposing team and shred flesh until there’s nothing left. With a ruthless and unforgiving captain, it’s no surprise their bread and butter is mid- to late game, after they’ve broken the minds and bodies of their opponents. Coaches eager to skewer and maim will delight in the savage brutality of these Butchers.

The Butcher’s Guild: The Scarlet Circle
“I remember once we celebrated to see the Master Butcher dethroned, and absent from the pitch. How wrong we were. What came next is even worse.”
— Obulus, Mortician’s Guild

<h3>What is a Runaway Railroad and who is Aardvark?</h3>
<p><strong>Aardvark’s Runaway Railroad</strong> is a cooperative game; everybody wins or everybody loses together.  More than luck determines the outcome.  The players need to discuss the options, trade track pieces and find a strategy to slow down the train engine or make the track form a loop.</p>
<p>Aardvark is a hard-working train engineer who is having trouble with the breaks on his engine today.  Aardvark’s friends will bring pieces of track to try and help him, but Kangaroo keeps bringing straight track which just makes the engine go faster. And some pieces of track are broken and must be avoided.</p>
<p>If more curves than straight track pieces are placed in front of Aardvark’s engine, then the engine will slow down and eventually stop.  Split tracks don’t slow down the engine, but do help to give Aardvark options.</p>
<p>Deceptively simple, Aardvark will typically run out of track if the players do not cooperate and trade track pieces effectively.  On the other hand, if the players check the distance the engine will move down the track and consider the order of player turns and the pieces they have remaining then they can frequently stop the engine.</p>

<h3>How to Play Aardvark’s Runaway Railroad</h3>
<p>A game of <strong>Aardvark’s Runaway Railroad</strong> takes between 10 and 25 minutes depending upon the number of players and how well they work together... and you can learn to play in less than that!  (Let's test that theory...)</p>
<p>Set the Engine Speed Indicator to the number of players plus one.  So if there are four players set the indicator to 5.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484174117/c87la9fezdokkywp7t0r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Place Aardvark’s engine on the Track Start.  Deal two pieces to each player, track-side up. Players should be encouraged to talk and make a plan.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484173899/gpfw146lbtuzu9rajzrw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Each player has two different pieces of track to choose from each turn.  Each player selects one piece of track to connect to the existing tracks.  (Warning: The engine can't run on broken track.)</p>
<p>Deal out another piece of track to each player, so they each have two pieces again.  Don’t move Aardvark just yet.  This is the end of Set Up.</p>
<p>If a player ever has two identical pieces in one hand, both pieces should be discarded and that player must take two new pieces.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every <strong>Game Round</strong> each player first places one piece of track from their hand on their turn.</p>
<p>Now look at the Engine Speed Indicator and move Aardvark that many pieces of track.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484172322/hokiu8ssihhw0szatwox.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Study the pieces Aardvark just covered this round (not including the piece he started on). Check to see if the engine is speeding up or slowing down.  Were there more plus one (+1 straight track) or more minus one (-1 curve track)?</p>
<p>Adjust the Engine Speed Indicator up or down one unit… or not at all if the curves and straight pieces have the same number.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now players can choose to trade the piece they have remaining in their hand with any of the other players.  The players need to know how far Aardvark's engine will travel (just look at the Engine Speed) and then attempt to trade pieces to the best advantage of everyone.  In many cases the players have to choose between bad and worse options (straight or broken track).  The object of the game is to overcome these challenges with planning and cooperation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then deal one piece so all the players have two pieces again.  And remember, if you have two identical pieces you’ll have to discard them and get two new pieces.</p>
<p>Don’t overlap or cross the track... Don’t go faster than 7... And try not to run out of track!</p>

<p>Once I settled on the idea of a game where players would work together to stop a train, I wondered who the story would be about.  I liked the idea of anthropomorphic animals for this game.  There are so many products that feature mice and rabbits; I felt I needed to steer clear of those.  I started from the top of the alphabet and ended right there: Aardvark.  I found several images of aardvarks and they immediately struck me as sympathetic characters.</p>

<p><strong>We have transformed Korea's traditional game ""Yootnori"" into an easy and entertaining board game ""Yooting""</strong></p>

<p>Yootnori has a history of 3-4,000 years in Korea and is deeply loved by the Koreans.</p>
<p>In order to widely spread Yootnori to other countries, we have formed ""Team Katchup"" to find out more ways that people around the world could enjoy Yootnori. </p>
<p>Because of the slight differences in rules by region, we had to gather each region's rules and create an integrated rule for the global players.

<p> </p>
<h2>LUCK VS STRATEGY</h2>
<p>Everytime you are Yooting, you must pray for Yoot or Tooy. Like we have mentioned in our rules, these two results would grant you another round of Yooting! What if the luck isn't on your side? The winner is not easily determined in this game. Luck is important but you can't ignore strategies in Yooting!</p>
<p>With strategic moves, you can select the paths that could block the enemy's moves or avoid their attacks! Don't forget that catching up with the enemy goblin could also give you another chance of Yooting.</p>
<p>Therefore, you can flip the game at any point in the game. The game isn't completely over until it is actually over.</p>

Fall-protected wooden yoot has a warm texture and is made of strong material. The wood has a dust-reluctant black coating.
The high-quality wooden yoot is lettered with laser pieces, therefore the letters don't fade for a long time.

 

 
LUCK VS STRATEGY
Everytime you are Yooting, you must pray for Yoot or Tooy. Like we have mentioned in our rules, these two results would grant you another round of Yooting! What if the luck isn't on your side? The winner is not easily determined in this game. Luck is important but you can't ignore strategies in Yooting!
With strategic moves, you can select the paths that could block the enemy's moves or avoid their attacks! Don't forget that catching up with the enemy goblin could also give you another chance of Yooting.
Therefore, you can flip the game at any point in the game. The game isn't completely over until it is actually over.
 

Team Katchup is made up of 5 members who got together to share fun and exciting things to a lot of people. The team sincerely wish to provide enthusiastic experience for all the players purchasing Yooting.
