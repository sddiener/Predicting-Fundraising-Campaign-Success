<h3><strong>What is the Alumni Company?</strong></h3>
<p>Each summer, the Shakespeare Academy @ Stratford invites former students to return to Stratford to create and perform a mobile production of a play by Shakespeare.</p>
<p>The Alumni Company is tasked with creating, directing, performing and producing a play of Shakespeare. Putting the skills they gained during their time as students at SA@S into practice and gaining real-world experience in all aspects of theater making, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>devising and staging a play by Shakespeare</li>
<li>collaborating as an ensemble</li>
<li>fundraising</li>
<li>producing</li>
<li>publicity</li>
<li>adapting Shakespeare's text </li>
<li>planning and managing a tour</li>
<li>designing set, costume, and sound</li>
<li>and training as teaching artists, with a new focus on community outreach this year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last year's Alumni Company has passed the baton onto a trio of intrepid theater-makers: Annie Saenger, Ellis, Sargeant, and Robert Solomon.  To support their residency in Stratford and the tour this summer, we hope to raise $2500. (That breaks down roughly to $600 for travel expenses, $600 for production costs, $800 for actor pay, and $500 to cover living expenses while in Stratford.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Last summer, four actors (Zoe Chen, Meaghan Johnson, Shana Laski, and Oliver Shoulson) took to the road with a clothesline, a ukulele, and their production of <i>THE TAMING OF THE SHREW</i>. For two weeks, they travelled along the east coast and beyond, making stops in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York City, as well as far abroad as Chicago. The Alumni Company began and ended their tour at the home of SA@S,  on the grounds of the former American Shakespeare Festival Theater.  The Alumni Company has performed at summer camps, art galleries, private homes, wineries, parks, schools, and universities.</p>
<p>Last year's Alumni Company not only grew as artists and collaborators, but also used the performance and process to engage with communities and local businesses to bring Shakespeare to people of all walks of life. By providing communities all along the eastern seaboard with FREE SHAKESPEARE, the Alumni Company accomplishes its goal of making Shakespeare accessible - and worth accessing - to everyone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""One of the most rewarding parts of the experience (and also one of the biggest challenges) is creating a truly self-contained show. You have minimal sets and costume resources, just whatever you can pack into a trunk, the rest of the story really comes from yourselves as actors. You have to build the rest of that world with your bodies and voices, and the best part is when you can see the audience is in that world with you."" -</i>Mia DeLasho (Alumni Co. 2016)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""For company members, this is a unique opportunity to take ownership of our own theatre-making experience, experiment and explore collaboratively.  Confidence in choice making and cross-over in responsibility for production roles is the main benefit of this freedom--working on multiple aspects of one production expands the appreciation for the way those different threads interweave, and experiences as a director can feed one’s approach to acting and vice versa.  Theatre is a field where being able to generate, publicize, and produce one’s own work is an incredible asset. "" -</i>Olivia Gregorich (Alumni Co. 2016)</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""The most rewarding part of the experience was when audience members stumbled upon the performance, like when we were at Short Beach in Stratford, CT... When kids would just sit completely rapt in the play and what we were doing. They got it. That's a pretty amazing feeling as an actor.""</i>- Kelly Letourneau (Alumni Co. 2015)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every summer, the Alumni Company is faced with the challenges of cutting down a Shakespeare play, creating a show (without a director), collaborating and managing egos in the rehearsal room, working within a limited budget, balancing time management and creativity, and the risk of sharing their own work with the world. </p>
<p><i>Macbeth</i> is one of Shakespeare’s most famous plays - its cultural purchase as a story of temptation, sin, and immense cruelty is almost unparalleled. In this production, we hope to breathe new life into the play by pushing against assumptions and questioning everything we think we know about Shakespeare’s most famous murderers. We hope to focus our investigation on three main facets of the play:</p>
<p>1. Gender roles, and what happens when they’re questioned, challenged, and even inverted.</p>
<p>2. The intersection of human choice and fate, and the point at which actions become irreversible and the future becomes inevitable.</p>
<p>3. Fear, and how the unknown cripples us in both action and identity.</p>
<p>As a three-person company, we have a unique opportunity to interrogate the play in an intense and novel way. Each challenge we face when working with such a reduced cast is another chance to use a creative solution to ask new questions and tell a new story with the text of the play. With your help, we hope to simultaneously do homage to and reimagine Macbeth.”</p> <p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Projects like these necessitate myriad risks and challenges….But one amazing thing about theater is that often it is the risks and the challenges that lead to growth, to intrigue and to change. “Risk” is not a dirty word in theater. The truth is, we don’t watch movies and shows to be entertained. We see them to be challenged—our beliefs, our intellect, our convictions, our disbelief—and to overcome those challenges. Audiences see theater to challenge and learn about themselves. And if the actors are not challenged, how could the audience ever be?""</i>- Nate Currier of the 2015 Alumni Company</p>

<h3>The Mighty Quinn Foundation, Inc. </h3>
<p>SA@S and its Alumni Company are a project of the Mighty Quinn Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charity dedicated to providing educational and theatrical experiences for young artists. A lifelong Stratford resident, Quinn Rooney grew up next door to the theater grounds and always hoped to see them revitalized. He passed away in June 2012 from a rare form of brain cancer at age 19, having led life to the fullest. SA@S holds the example of Quinn's great joy, utmost generosity, indefatigable spirit, and love for the fellowship of sharing theater with friends at the heart of its founding values.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>November 21, 2019 marks the 20th anniversary of the passing of Quentin Crisp, English-born writer, actor, eccentric and raconteur. He became famous from the publication of his 1968 autobiography THE NAKED CIVIL SERVANT, which chronicled the oppression he faced as a homosexual in England before, during and after World War II, when being gay was illegal. THE NAKED CIVIL SERVANT later became an award-winning film starring John Hurt, first broadcast in the United States by PBS in 1975. Crisp performed a one-man show, AN EVENING WITH QUENTIN CRISP, which he toured nationally and internationally and which won an L.A. Drama Critic’s Circle and Drama Desk award. Crisp moved to New York at the age of 72, where he wrote books on style, culture and manners, appeared in numerous films and late night talk show interviews, and published a second autobiography, HOW TO BECOME A VIRGIN. He has been immortalized in artworks by Al Hirschfeld and was the inspiration for Sting’s hit song ""An Englishman In New York."" The third and final installment of his autobiography, THE LAST WORD: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, was published posthumously in 2017, while AND ONE MORE THING, his last book, was published in 2018 and includes his collected poetry and the script of his one-man show. Both books display Crisp's insightful, amusing, and at times controversial philosophies which remain surprisingly relevant today, including the revelation at age 90 that he was not in fact homosexual, but rather transgender.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh writer, producer, performer, arts advocate, and Crisp scholar Brian Edward has been selected by Phillip Ward and the Quentin Crisp Estate to collaborate on the composition of QUENTIN CRISP: THE LAST WORD, a new stage script and performance extracted from the writings contained within THE LAST WORD: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY and AND ONE MORE THING, which will have its wold premiere in Pittsburgh in February 2020 before touring nationally and internationally.  The project is seeking funding from individual donors, corporations, and grants to cover production expenses, marketing, and the professional filming of the show to submit for local and national broadcast, and to offer support that will continue the legacy of Quentin Crisp and the continuation of the Quentin Crisp Archives far into the future.</p>

<p>Quentin Crisp was an important voice in the history of LGBTQIA liberation, though his works and influence are at risk of slipping into obscurity. Perhaps it was advantageous that Phillip Ward recorded Crisp's final autobiography shortly before his passing in 1999 and did not publish it until 2017. In a sense, it's an exciting comeback from someone who never actually went away, as Quentin Crisp's observations and philosophies seem even more relevant today than they did in his own time. The stage work QUENTIN CRISP: THE LAST WORD celebrates the gift of Crisp's farewell to us all, delivered 20 years after his death. It celebrates the fact that he is still with us, and reminds us that now, especially within the current climate of cultural strife laden with attacks on civil liberties, his powerful words can lend great inspiration. As has been stated, this project intends to initiate the official founding of a nonprofit organization that will foster and continue that inspiration indefinitely.</p>
<p>Many people today struggle with identity, especially LGBTQIA individuals, despite the advances in equality and acceptance. The works and words of Quentin Crisp offer refuge and inspiration for those who struggle with who they really are, and how to interact with the vast and often cruel world at large. Although his wisdom comes from an LGBTQIA perspective, Crisp's anecdotes and examples are universally relatable, while at the same time, wildly entertaining. The very particular voice of Quentin Crisp can be a beacon of hope to many today, just as it was in his lifetime. This particular stage presentation gives a more intimate look at Crisp than any piece prior, and in the author's own words upon entering the final days of his life.</p>

I will be playing each song on my acoustic guitar, accompanied by my daughter on cello. </p>
<p>I am currently rehearsing the script,  promoting the Festival performances via online (@aseafullofstarsthemusical on  Facebook and Instagram  ) print media, and currently fundraising for the money it takes to do all of these things.</p>
<p>The funds raised through this campaign will go toward paying for printing postcards and posters to promote the show, as well as program printing and travel expenses.  </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><u>Why am I doing this?</u></p>
<p>From a young age, dance has provided me with opportunities of comradery, business, entertainment, culture and self-exploration.<br/>I have always wanted to share my passions for dance and movement, so much that I have found joy in motivating others to pursue dance opportunities as well.</p>
<p><strong>Rexburg, Idaho</strong><br/><br/>While living eastern Idaho for a few years, I immersed myself in dance leadership opportunities: directing, choreographing, collaborating, etc. Through these work experiences, I was able to meet a TON of amazing artists from as young as 4 to 50+ (still young by the way). I had created such a soft spot for the artists here and only wished they could have more local advantages. For example, although there are a number of dance studios within the area, I had hope for more dance-funded opportunities; however, outside of dance recitals and showcases, larger opportunities are held out-of-state. I want to promote these hardworking dancers and their love for dance/movement. I want them to know that just because there are not as many local chances, that it does not mean other opportunities are not out there. I am here to provide but one of the many. As stated in my <strong>funding breakdown</strong>, my flight price is specifically for Idaho.<strong> </strong> <i>There will be three videos filmed here: contemporary, modern and street dance.</i></p>
<p><strong>Utah</strong><br/><br/>Oh Utah! This area is actually where my Tahitian-collaboration dance video will take place, simply because the majority of dancers live here! While Utah is also known for popular Tahitian-dance competitions, I am not in collaboration with any of them. Within this state, I will be using music from two amazing music artists: Jay Warren and Mimi Knowles </p>
<p><strong>Las Vegas</strong><br/><br/>One video will be filmed here, of one great family-friend. That is all I will divulge :)<br/><br/><strong>I strongly believe that the creative processes of art--through dance, movement, videography and other mediums--can impart clarity towards a person's goals and identity, as well as provide a safe-space for self-exploration within their craft.</strong></p>
<p><u><i>These videos will be showcased through a virtual convention known as PMX: Pacific Media Expo, on 11/21 &amp; 11/22.</i></u></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Obstacles</h3>
<p><u>What are my challenges?</u></p>
<p>While it is redundant, money and time are my most difficult challenges.<br/><br/>For instance, it was never my goal to travel out for these videos, but it needs to happen.<br/>All of my choreography, alone and through collaboration, were submitted via text and different social media platforms. I have been choreographing and mocking up this project in my room, and in my parents' kitchen when my children have no babysitters.<br/><br/>As for money, I would gladly pay for this entire project out of my own pocket, but that is not an option.  I am not paying for babysitters while I'm gone; my family has offered to assist. <br/><br/>This is also a project that, to many people, seems like a fad: <i>""Not super important"", ""Just for fun"", ""There is no end goal"", ""A waste of time""</i>, etc.<br/>And to those remarks, I would say, ""Yes. This is a lot of fun and fulfilling. I do not know where this will take me, but I have this passion for myself and those around me. I am not about to throw it out and label it as a fad.

<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>After a long period of confinement, <a href=""https://intandemlab.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IN TANDEM LAB</a> is back on stage!! We are excited to announce <a href=""https://intandemlab.org/her-story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERSTORY</a>, set to premiere on August 4th, 2021. Presented in partnership with the Ohio Theater as part of the annual Ice Factory Summer Festival, the show will be one of the earliest live theatre openings that will take place in New York City! </p>
<p>Initially commissioned by HERE Arts Center, the first version of the play on Zoom was produced in November 2020 during the pandemic. Now, Herstory is opening as a live theater piece this upcoming August. Reworking the online version to become a fully staged play, In Tandem Lab continues with its mission of generating new theatrical experiences inspired by a classic material. This time, Shakespeare's Tempest's female characters have been the source of inspiration as we asked: why are the women in that play mostly silent or absent?</p>
<p>We would love you to get involved and support our return to the stages for our official premier.</p>
<h3>WHAT'S HERSTORY ABOUT?</h3>
<p>A woman leaves an inheritance. Two younger women who have apparently no relationship with each other are receiving it if they create something together. Excavating the drawings and short stories of an artist, these two women will stop living arrested by their unknown past and come out of isolation by giving life to a woman's story. How can we start telling the stories written in our genes and passed from one generation to another? Inspired but the female characters of Shakespeare's Tempest, Herstory attempts to write an intimate take on revenge, isolation, and the personal prisons we all must overcome.</p>

<h3>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</h3>
<p>This campaign is designed to help us raise funds to cover half of HERSTORY's production expenses to be part of the Ice Factory Festival at The New Ohio Theatre in NYC. With your generous support, we will be able to fully recognize and honor the great work of the artists making HERSTORY possible. Paying our collaborators has always been a principle of our company. Still, after these past months where theater has been hit so hard by the pandemic, it has become more than ever an essential aspect of In Tandem Lab's values. We are requesting US$4,000 to cover the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artists fees</li>
<li>Costume &amp; Set Designer</li>
<li>Videographer fees</li>
<li>Light operator fees.</li>
<li>Essays expenses</li>
<li>Travel cost for one of the artists</li>
</ul>
<p>We have selected some exciting rewards for you, such as entrance tickets to the play,  INTANDEM LAB's tote bag, postcards, and an online meeting with the creators!</p>

<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>Silence and entrapment are part of women's histories beyond time and space. At In Tandem Lab, we consider it essential to explore new dramatic territories by creating, commissioning, or reinterpreting classic themes. Herstory excavates women's pasts from the 17th century up to the digital age in the quest for understanding the long history of entrapment and silence that has shaped some of us today. This project is vital to start the conversation and offer alternative narratives to our past inspiring stories from alternative perspectives. </p>
<p>At the same time, and after almost 17 months of isolation, we are happy to go back into the theater and reconnect with live audiences. As theater makers, we trade in change. This has been evident during the pandemic where so many artists have produced shows using any medium available. Now the possibility of sharing the work with a live audience becomes the central impulse to be together in a room dreaming again.</p>

</div></div>","OVERVIEW
After a long period of confinement, IN TANDEM LAB is back on stage!! We are excited to announce HERSTORY, set to premiere on August 4th, 2021. Presented in partnership with the Ohio Theater as part of the annual Ice Factory Summer Festival, the show will be one of the earliest live theatre openings that will take place in New York City! 
Initially commissioned by HERE Arts Center, the first version of the play on Zoom was produced in November 2020 during the pandemic. Now, Herstory is opening as a live theater piece this upcoming August. Reworking the online version to become a fully staged play, In Tandem Lab continues with its mission of generating new theatrical experiences inspired by a classic material. This time, Shakespeare's Tempest's female characters have been the source of inspiration as we asked: why are the women in that play mostly silent or absent?
We would love you to get involved and support our return to the stages for our official premier.
WHAT'S HERSTORY ABOUT?
A woman leaves an inheritance. Two younger women who have apparently no relationship with each other are receiving it if they create something together. Excavating the drawings and short stories of an artist, these two women will stop living arrested by their unknown past and come out of isolation by giving life to a woman's story. How can we start telling the stories written in our genes and passed from one generation to another? Inspired but the female characters of Shakespeare's Tempest, Herstory attempts to write an intimate take on revenge, isolation, and the personal prisons we all must overcome.

WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET
This campaign is designed to help us raise funds to cover half of HERSTORY's production expenses to be part of the Ice Factory Festival at The New Ohio Theatre in NYC. With your generous support, we will be able to fully recognize and honor the great work of the artists making HERSTORY possible. Paying our collaborators has always been a principle of our company. Still, after these past months where theater has been hit so hard by the pandemic, it has become more than ever an essential aspect of In Tandem Lab's values. We are requesting US$4,000 to cover the following elements:

Artists fees
Costume & Set Designer
Videographer fees
Light operator fees.
Essays expenses
Travel cost for one of the artists

We have selected some exciting rewards for you, such as entrance tickets to the play,  INTANDEM LAB's tote bag, postcards, and an online meeting with the creators!

<h2>Farmgate Theatre</h2>
<p><strong>Outdoor theatre that connects: Farm made, farm played</strong></p> <p>Have you ever bought produce from the end of a farm laneway, at one of those colourful little stands full of fresh homegrown goodies? These are called Farmgate sales, because you buy directly from the farm. Farmgate Theatre is a new theatre company on Prince Edward Island that approaches our theatre in much the same way: we make it on the farm and you come here to get it.</p>
<p>We, being Cameron MacDuffee and Karen Graves, are two professional performers, with over 50 years experience between us, that recently moved to PEI and bought a 100 hundred acre farm. One of our dreams has been to have a farm theatre and this year we are making it come true. We are launching our company by presenting a brand new, original piece of outdoor theatre entitled The Road to Belong.</p>
<h3>The show</h3>
<p>This is a passion project that is being created collectively by sixteen island-based artists from a variety of disciplines. It gives all of us a chance to create, perform and earn some income after a year of having very little opportunity to do so in the performing arts, and we are working hard to raise the funds to make it happen.</p>
<p>The Road to Belong is an exploration into the experience of belonging: with self, with others and with nature. In a time fraught with divisive politics and the added stress of pandemic isolation, we are pouring our creative energy into developing a deeper understanding of what it means to belong, and look forward to sharing our discoveries. The artists in the show have been commissioned to create individual pieces on the theme that will be woven together through a collaborative process led by our director and dramaturg Charlotte Gowdy. The show itself will have the audience travel about the farm encountering different scenes and scenarios, literally and figuratively walking The Road to Belong with us. </p>
<h3>The artists</h3>
<p>One of the great strengths of our project is the diversity of our collective members. Our company includes published, award-winning writers like David Weale, young up and coming artists Reequal Smith and Kendi Tarichia, visually impaired performer/creator Bruce Horak, nationally recognized actors Julain Molnar, Greg Gale, Alicia Toner and Jan Rudd, seasoned classical musicians Jeffrey Bazett-Jones and Adam Hill, and the Mi'kmaq Poet Laureate of PEI Julie Pellissier-Lush. We all bring to this project both a wealth of professional experience and varied cultural perspectives. In addition we have the remarkable award-winning talent of Charlotte Gowdy to help us realize our work. Charlotte has directed at the Stratford Festival, studied clown in Paris, performed as an actor across Canada, been an associate artistic director, and worked extensively in devised creation as well traditional dramaturgy. </p>

<p>Group meetings began in January 2021 and we have continued to meet once a month over Zoom, where we share material, discuss ideas and take suggestions from our director. Additionally, each artist meets with our dramaturg once a month to help develop their individual pieces.</p>
<p>May 23rd and 24th we are having a content development workshop on the farm. This is our first chance to gather in person as an ensemble, and will be an invaluable opportunity to see how the work will come to life on the land. We will get to work on our individual pieces, on group numbers, and begin figuring out how all the parts will fit together to create the larger story.</p>
<p>Throughout the summer we will continue content development work, both on Zoom and with in person ensemble meetings, and work on set, prop and costume designs.</p>
<p>September 1-9 we will be rehearsing the show at the farm. This is when we bring all the pieces together leading up to our performance days September 10, 11, 12.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Roadblocks</h3>
<p>We have all been through an incredibly challenging year as a result of the pandemic. The performing arts have been hit hard, with many of us finding our careers have come to a full stop until further notice. On PEI, we are currently permitted to gather in sufficient numbers to put on an event for a small audience, and for that we are very appreciative. However, as we all know, the situation is very unpredictable. It is an ongoing challenge to plan for the best and prepare for anything, and we have several scenarios of how we will carry on our work if health guidelines change for the worse.</p>
<p>Current back-up plans in the event of a COVID 19 lockdown include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completing our creative work on group sessions on Zoom</li>
<li>Postponing shows to a date when restrictions are lifted</li>
<li>Perform the show for video camera (if we can gather the cast within regulations) and release tickets to an online screening of the show</li>

We hope you find just the right one!</p>
<p>Maybe you want to help but are looking for a different way to lend a hand, an alternate to donating money ? Here are a few ideas.</p>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>email this campaign page to people you think would be interested.</li>
<li>share or post about us on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, to help us spread the word about our plans.</li>
<li>plan to attend a show in September, to find out for yourself what it's all about.</li>

On this campaign page is a list of donation levels, and each one has a perk associated with it. You might wonder what the perks are all about. Do you remember when cereal boxes had toys in them? That's basically what perks are. They are for the kid in you, the one who wants to find a prize at the bottom of the box. They are rewards for your good deed, a thanks from us to you. We hope you find just the right one!
Maybe you want to help but are looking for a different way to lend a hand, an alternate to donating money ? Here are a few ideas.
You can:

email this campaign page to people you think would be interested.
share or post about us on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, to help us spread the word about our plans.
plan to attend a show in September, to find out for yourself what it's all about.

 
Whether or not you are able to contribute to Farmgate Theatre, we thank you so much for taking an interest!

<p>For me, one of the most complicated tasks when creating a dance is to find the right music. My favourite band is MUSE.

</div></div>","Hello! My name is Anastasia Engasheva. I am in my graduation year at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy. My first meeting with ballet was when I was 5 years old and appeared on stage as a Little Red Riding Hood.  Since then ballet has been an essential part of my live. I have always wanted to express my emotions and feelings, thoughts and experiences - through dance. I created my first dance when I was 9 years old. The school’s headmistress was so impressed that she included it in the school’s New Year performance.I grew up, my dances became more serious and deeper, and my choreography, more relevant and complicated. Not only do I now express myself in dance, but I also aim to conduct a dialogue with the audience: I tell a story, ask philosophical questions and give the viewer an opportunity both to see a good show and to reflect on its meanings. 
My ballet is called “The System.” It is a lyrical dystopia that tells the story of love between two people who live in a state where citizens are forced by a totalitarian leader to forget their emotions and feelings.The main characters, risking everything to be together, decide to fight against ""the system”. For the lovers this struggle is tragic, but the ballet’s finale highlights the triumph of humanism.  



For me, one of the most complicated tasks when creating a dance is to find the right music. My favourite band is MUSE. I am fascinated by the band’s songs: their hard guitar riffs combined with a symphonic orchestra, their lyrical piano ballads and emotional anguish. If this music collects stadiums, why can’t it collect theatres, I asked myself. But then, why would MUSE allow me to use their music in my ballet?    



I have chosen 11 songs by MUSE. To create the ballet, I looked for inspiration not only in the music itself but also in the lyrics of the songs and in the books that had inspired Bellamy to write them.  

I sent the description of the project and the libretto to MUSE. The result was incredible!  They allowed me to use the music!

 More than 30 people take part in this ballet as volunteers:

</div>
<p></p>Unlike your typical comedy club, Zingerz is a Membership Discount Club for Comedy (think of us as Sam's Club for Funny).  Although Zingerz Comedy's Improv Show is new it is supported by an experienced team, both on stage and off, with backgrounds in Theater/Comedy Club Ownership/Management, Improv Comedy Production, and overall Corporate Management (CEO, CFO, COO, etc.).  <br/><br/>The central DFW area is currently short on Clean Entertainment options. 
 Families and lovers of clean comedy are limited in their outing 
choices, and LIVE entertainment options for those seeking family friendly fun are 
even more scarce.  Most live comedy within the Dallas/Fort Worth area is blue... Not ""blue"" like the Smurfs, but bad language &amp; inappropriate material ""blue""... Got it?  Okay.  Families are not welcome to these shows and the Central DFW area has NO Improv 
Comedy options at all!  Zingerz Comedy Club wants to change this by setting up a
 permanent home for CLEAN IMPROV COMEDY right here in central DFW!!!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436245112/ge2ye5qkxijdyctvt7zk.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 378.342px; height: 284px;""/></p>

he tenido algunas oportunidades de salir del país; ahora, quiero dar la
oportunidad a alguien más para que crezca tanto como yo. </p>
<p>Fui parte de <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Stroke-Urbano-Dance-Company/239582176204682?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stroke Urbano</a>, grupo de bailarines profesionales.  Mi deseo es ayudarlos a que exploren más allá
y puedan crecer en el arte de la danza. </p>
<p>Viajar para bailar me hizo crecer como bailarina y como persona, así que
quiero que otros vivan esta experiencia también.  Por esta razón, empezare
por becar uno de ellos y que viajen a Chicago a recibir un taller intensivo de
danza sería una gran oportunidad para que sigan explotando su talento.  En este caso escogí a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/miirnam?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mirna Moreno</a> integrante del grupo y especializada en Jazz y hip hop para hacer el primer viaje y la primera donación. </p>
<p>El mundo es tan grande que no podemos solo estar en un solo lugar, esto desencadenará
un intercambio de culturas y de danza; parte de mi sueño, es romper con las
barreras culturales y crear un sentido de comunidad entre individuos. </p>
<p>Para Mirna a quien le daría la beca esto es seria como<b> un sueño hecho realidad</b>.  Darle un viaje <b>todo pagado</b> para ir a hacer lo que ama es algo va a cambiarle la
vida.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1271241/files/20150305100451-Mirna2.jpg?1425578691"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>Más a detalle</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Lo que quiero es que <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/miirnam?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mirna Moreno</a> vaya al Workshop intensivo de <a href=""http://giordanodance.org/workshop.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Giordano Dance Jazz a Chicago</a>
este Junio 2015. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>El financiamiento que estoy pidiendo va directo a el pago del taller
intensivo que son $850.00, el ticket de avión cuesta $800.00 aproximadamente,
la estadía (que pediré hospedaje a mis amigos para bajar costos); también
evalué unos $300.00  y viáticos, porque no quisiera que ella pasara inconvenientes
durante su viaje. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Este financiamiento es administrado por mí, con  los contactos que
tengo facilitaré los pagos anticipados y le daré lo que necesite.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b><i>Dar es mejor que recibir</i></b><b>,</b> al iniciar esto quiero experimentar lo que es
realmente dar algo de gran a valor a alguien que de otra manera se le
dificultaría demasiado conseguirlo. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Si no se alcanza la meta, aun así este dinero va ayudará a mi amiga y al
grupo de baile <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Stroke-Urbano-Dance-Company/239582176204682?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stroke Urbano</a>. Ellos siempre necesitan financiamiento de
vestuario y atenciones médicas (por cualquier lesión que ellos pudieran tener),
que como bailarines siempre estamos al borde de cualquier golpe.  Es necesario que estén atendidos. </p>
<p><b>El impacto: Cambiando al mundo un movimiento a la vez. </b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Esta campaña es un comienzo para empezar una fundación de becas para
bailarines guatemaltecos.  Todos debemos
tener el apoyo de convertirnos en las personas que nacimos para hacer. Becas
son el mejor comienzo para esto. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>He trabajado con la <a href=""http://organizacionparalasartes.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Organización para las Artes (ORPA)</a> y esta es una
fundación sin fines de lucro que se dedica a traer arte a Guatemala. Estoy
tomando el ejemplo que me da <b>Geraldina
Baca-Spross</b> al haber becado a una joven de muy escasos recursos a
participar en un concurso con el Houston Ballet y al final esta misma joven fue
ganadora de una beca para viajar. Así que he visto el impacto que puede tener
esta pequeña contribución económica. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Pequeñas acciones hacen grandes cambios y quiero generar más pequeñas
acciones, porque todos nacimos para hacer grandes cosas. :)</p>
<p><b>Riesgos y desafíos</b></p>
<p>Entiendo que hay muchísimos obstáculos para lograr ener un fondo de becas y
mantener un flujo de caja; y, que los becados aprovechen al máximo este
recurso.  Soy alguien determinada y sumamente
apasionada, en especial por la danza, así que ante todo, quiero ver a mis
amigos bailarines superarse y llegar a niveles profesionales que ni ellos se
imaginan. Guatemala tiene talento y quiero compartirlo. </p>
<p>Si cualquier inconveniente sucediera, pues emprenderé más trabajos alternos
y presentaciones para conseguir el dinero y seguir ayudando a los
bailarines. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Para mantener el flujo en el fondo, conectaré empresas alternas para
contribuir. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Para asegurarme que los jóvenes becados aprovecharan este recurso, pues
primero serán <i>audicionados</i> (la que
quiero becar ahora ya lo está y me consta que hará el mejor uso de esto) </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>De tener más desafíos siempre podemos bailar para recaudar más fondos y eso
también me da seguridad de que los bailarines están determinados a bailar y
compartir lo que han aprendido. </p>
<p><b>Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar</b></p>
<p>Otras maneras en las que me puedes ayudar son: </p>
<p>Puedes compartir mi campaña en tus redes sociales y contarles a tus amigos
de mi iniciativa. </p>
<p>También si quisieras ayudar de otra manera, ya sea conoces gente en Chicago
o alguien que pudiera contribuir con hospedaje o el ticket del avión, acepto
también gente motivada que quiera colaborar conmigo a este fondo para
bailarines. </p>
<p>Aquí en <b>Indiegogo</b> hay muchas
herramientas que pueden ayudar a difundir mi campaña. </p>
<p>De verdad gracias por darme de tu tiempo para leer esto y ¡muchas más
gracias por tu apoyo! :)</p><div>

danza sería una gran oportunidad para que sigan explotando su talento.  En este caso escogí a Mirna Moreno integrante del grupo y especializada en Jazz y hip hop para hacer el primer viaje y la primera donación. 
El mundo es tan grande que no podemos solo estar en un solo lugar, esto desencadenará
un intercambio de culturas y de danza; parte de mi sueño, es romper con las
barreras culturales y crear un sentido de comunidad entre individuos. 
Para Mirna a quien le daría la beca esto es seria como un sueño hecho realidad.  Darle un viaje todo pagado para ir a hacer lo que ama es algo va a cambiarle la
vida.  
Más a detalle
· 
Lo que quiero es que Mirna Moreno vaya al Workshop intensivo de Giordano Dance Jazz a Chicago
este Junio 2015. 
· 
El financiamiento que estoy pidiendo va directo a el pago del taller
intensivo que son $850.00, el ticket de avión cuesta $800.00 aproximadamente,
la estadía (que pediré hospedaje a mis amigos para bajar costos); también
evalué unos $300.00  y viáticos, porque no quisiera que ella pasara inconvenientes
durante su viaje. 
· 
Este financiamiento es administrado por mí, con  los contactos que
tengo facilitaré los pagos anticipados y le daré lo que necesite.
· 
Dar es mejor que recibir, al iniciar esto quiero experimentar lo que es
realmente dar algo de gran a valor a alguien que de otra manera se le
dificultaría demasiado conseguirlo. 
· 
Si no se alcanza la meta, aun así este dinero va ayudará a mi amiga y al
grupo de baile Stroke Urbano. Ellos siempre necesitan financiamiento de
vestuario y atenciones médicas (por cualquier lesión que ellos pudieran tener),
que como bailarines siempre estamos al borde de cualquier golpe.  Es necesario que estén atendidos. 
El impacto: Cambiando al mundo un movimiento a la vez. 
· 
Esta campaña es un comienzo para empezar una fundación de becas para
bailarines guatemaltecos.  Todos debemos
tener el apoyo de convertirnos en las personas que nacimos para hacer. Becas
son el mejor comienzo para esto. 
· 
He trabajado con la Organización para las Artes (ORPA) y esta es una
fundación sin fines de lucro que se dedica a traer arte a Guatemala. Estoy
tomando el ejemplo que me da Geraldina
Baca-Spross al haber becado a una joven de muy escasos recursos a
participar en un concurso con el Houston Ballet y al final esta misma joven fue
ganadora de una beca para viajar. Así que he visto el impacto que puede tener
esta pequeña contribución económica. 
· 
Pequeñas acciones hacen grandes cambios y quiero generar más pequeñas
acciones, porque todos nacimos para hacer grandes cosas. :)
Riesgos y desafíos
Entiendo que hay muchísimos obstáculos para lograr ener un fondo de becas y
mantener un flujo de caja; y, que los becados aprovechen al máximo este
recurso.  Soy alguien determinada y sumamente
apasionada, en especial por la danza, así que ante todo, quiero ver a mis
amigos bailarines superarse y llegar a niveles profesionales que ni ellos se
imaginan. Guatemala tiene talento y quiero compartirlo. 
Si cualquier inconveniente sucediera, pues emprenderé más trabajos alternos
y presentaciones para conseguir el dinero y seguir ayudando a los
bailarines. 
· 
Para mantener el flujo en el fondo, conectaré empresas alternas para
contribuir. 
· 
Para asegurarme que los jóvenes becados aprovecharan este recurso, pues
primero serán audicionados (la que
quiero becar ahora ya lo está y me consta que hará el mejor uso de esto) 
· 
De tener más desafíos siempre podemos bailar para recaudar más fondos y eso
también me da seguridad de que los bailarines están determinados a bailar y
compartir lo que han aprendido. 
Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar
Otras maneras en las que me puedes ayudar son: 
Puedes compartir mi campaña en tus redes sociales y contarles a tus amigos
de mi iniciativa. 
También si quisieras ayudar de otra manera, ya sea conoces gente en Chicago
o alguien que pudiera contribuir con hospedaje o el ticket del avión, acepto
también gente motivada que quiera colaborar conmigo a este fondo para
bailarines. 
Aquí en Indiegogo hay muchas
herramientas que pueden ayudar a difundir mi campaña.

</div></div>","Welcome to Our Funding Page!
Hella Theatre Company is a company co-founded by a dedicated and talented
group of Columbia College Chicago theatre students that feel it is important to create
art without boundaries. So, we thought out a show, wrote it down, cast it, and are
going to put it on in February! 
 This show is called SHELTER.  This production is a site specific,
experimental theatre piece about people staying the night in a homeless
shelter. The production tells the stories of the lives of various characters. The characters are angry, sad, loving, and
passionate. However, what we want you to see is that they're just ordinary people
in a difficult situation. Many of you know them and might even be one
yourself. This show is about what makes people who they are and why we do
the things we do.
Of course, there's also a goat. Because
everything is better with farm animals.
This campaign is extremely important. We at Hella Theatre Company are dedicated to
producing and creating art that has an impact. We mean to impact your mind,
heart, and soul. We hope our show will cause you to open and expand your view
of your world around you. 
 We want you to leave this experience
with an solid opinion about what you saw. Good, bad or indifferent, we are
going to have an impact. Maybe you will be changed. We hope so. We are spreading awareness of homelessness in Chicago, our city, people we may see everyday, and
around the globe, we know that this show will spread that awareness to you. Thank you for taking the
time to be a part of Hella Theatre Company’s production of SHELTER, coming in

Young, talented theater artists came together to create their work outside of the commercial producing establishment of the Broadway theaters. </p><p>Caffe Cino, La MaMa, Circle Rep, and many more were formed. </p><p>This Downtown Theater movement allowed for some of the most important work of the American Theater to occur. This movement became the off-Broadway community that is so vital to theater artists.</p><p>We look to this movement as a source of inspiration and propose to take the baton and begin a new movement.</p><p>THE UPTOWN THEATER MOVEMENT</p><p>The northern region of Manhattan is an area exploding with creative artists. </p><p>This is the place of the Harlem Renaissance. It has always been a cradle of revolution, change, and provocation.</p><p>Currently, in Hamilton Heights in particular, we see a new confluence of talented theater artists and a changing physical landscape.</p><p>As the neighborhood has grown to include many restaurants, bars, and art galleries, the need for theater is imperative. THE NATIONAL THEATER OF UPTOWN fills this need.</p><p>As a group of artists with unique visions of dramatic story telling, we have a distinct plan for the productions we create.</p><p>We will seek out and transform vacant buildings, storefronts, warehouses, rooftops into performance spaces.

Young, talented theater artists came together to create their work outside of the commercial producing establishment of the Broadway theaters. Caffe Cino, La MaMa, Circle Rep, and many more were formed. This Downtown Theater movement allowed for some of the most important work of the American Theater to occur. This movement became the off-Broadway community that is so vital to theater artists.We look to this movement as a source of inspiration and propose to take the baton and begin a new movement.THE UPTOWN THEATER MOVEMENTThe northern region of Manhattan is an area exploding with creative artists. This is the place of the Harlem Renaissance. It has always been a cradle of revolution, change, and provocation.Currently, in Hamilton Heights in particular, we see a new confluence of talented theater artists and a changing physical landscape.As the neighborhood has grown to include many restaurants, bars, and art galleries, the need for theater is imperative. THE NATIONAL THEATER OF UPTOWN fills this need.As a group of artists with unique visions of dramatic story telling, we have a distinct plan for the productions we create.We will seek out and transform vacant buildings, storefronts, warehouses, rooftops into performance spaces. By building our sets in entirely empty spaces, we create complete theatrical experiences.We create grand, theatrical events that lift, enlighten, and enliven the lives of the audience. Theater is a place where one goes to experience something beyond themselves and that is what we provide.Our aesthetic is character driven, explosive, heightened plays.As we simplify the elements of theater, a purity of dramatic storytelling is revealed.This simplification extends to our process. We develop and produce our plays swiftly and economically in order to respond to the political and social landscape immediately.   Our development process puts the artist at the fore, allowing us to present a pure, unadulterated artistic vision to the world.This is the mark of the Uptown Theater Movement. WHAT WE NEEDAs we embark on the formation of this company it is essential that we find the financial means necessary to make our work as powerfully as we envision.In order to create our inaugural production and advance the company’s strategic plan, our budget is $30,000.  It’s a challenging yet achievable goal and that’s where you, our community of fellow artists and supporters, come into play.  Every bit helps.  YOUR CONTRIBUTION WILL ACHIEVE- Rehearsal and Performance space rental for our first production.- Marketing and Public Relations for the formation of the company.- Designer and Set Construction costs.- Actor, Stage Manager, Designer, and Production Staff salaries.- A foundation of financial stability to ensure that the vision of the Uptown Theater Movement propels into the future. A REVOLUTION Making theater is an act of rebellion.Making a theater company is a revolution.Come join the revolution. Artistic LeadersNATHAN CANN received his MFA in Dramatic Writing from NYU-Tisch.  While in school he was selected for Theater Masters where his play was produced in Aspen and NYC.  Upon graduation he received his department's award for Outstanding Graduate Playwright.  He's been a semi finalist for the National Playwrights Conference at the O'Neill four times and was named a Finalist for the 2015 conference.  His play, The Last Buckley, received a workshop at The Kennedy Center and was named a finalist for the 2014 Goldberg Prize.  He was also awarded the inaugural Richie Jackson Artist Fellowship. CLAIRE BROWNELL is a New York City based actor, writer and producer.  She has performed on and off Broadway, in regional theaters around the country and is a member of the Amios Theater Collective.  Select credits: Broadway - The 39 Steps; First National Tour: The 39 Steps; Regional work with The Shakespeare Theatre, Hartford Stage, Pioneer Theatre, American Conservatory Theatre, Huntington Theatre, Arkansas Repertory Theatre, La Jolla Playhouse, Seattle Repertory Theatre, Gulfshore Playhouse, Florida Repertory Theatre, Palm Beach Dramaworks and Maltz Jupiter Theatre.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>With many people wishing that 2017 is going to be a good year, the UEA Opera Society strive to fulfil these hopes by producing their first annual opera. Without a music degree available at UEA, many of the students can miss out on developing their talents, particularly if the societies available don't cater to their particular style. That is why, after too many voices were not being heard, our president Poppy Damazer conspired to create our company. This was not only to help young musicians develop their vocal skills by attending master classes with the experienced classical singer Hannah Francis, but also to give them a real chance to perform. Hence 'Dido and Aeneas', a passionate and tragic story of love, power and treachery that relates to the vigour of modern life whilst letting you enjoy the fiction of the old.</p>
<p>As a company, we really just want to achieve something that differs from our degree and the general busy-ness that we all suffer from. And to do this, your contributions are essential to turn a small scale amateur performance into a professional production; with your donations, however big, our set and costumes will be eye-catching instead of bland, our audiences will be full and energetic rather than half empty. And most importantly, you will be proud of what you have helped to create. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>7:1 was co-founded by Mannes composer, Alexander Chadwell and Rovaco Dance Company choreographer, Rohan Bhargava. These two young artists and entrepreneurs envisioned a collaborative performance project with three goals in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>To provide current students at Mannes School of Music an opportunity to be commissioned </li>
<li>To generate exciting new works of music and dance through a collaboration between composers, instrumentalists, dancers, and one choreographer.</li>
<li>To encourage young and emerging artists to gain a deeper understanding of a medium other than their own.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, 7 Mannes composers were selected to work intimately with Rovaco Dance Company and choreographer Rohan Bhargava. After four months of labor, they have created 7 new works of interdisciplinary art that are now finished and ready to be presented! Come and support the achievements of these artists on Saturday, May 13th at 3 pm at The Auditorium on 66 W. 12th Street, New York, NY. Tickets are free but you can save your seat at: <a href=""http://www.sevencolonone.eventbrite.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sevencolonone.eventbrite.com</a></p>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This project needs $7,000 in order to meet its budget and make sure the performance is a success. Here is what we have to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>140 hours of rehearsal space</li>
<li>Hourly wages for dancers</li>
<li>Commissioning award for each composer</li>
<li>Payment for production staff</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Advertising (posters, postcards, graphic design, printing)</li>
<li>Documentation (audio, video, and photography)</li>
</ul>
<p>By donating to this project, you get to support interdisciplinary art and avail exciting perks. We are offering benefits such as one-on-one conversations with artists, invitation to future rehearsals, an exclusive dinner with 7:1 founders, and even a weekend trip to Cape Cod with Rovaco Dance! Our goal is to foster meaningful relationships with our patrons and give them insight into our creative process. We want you to know that we appreciate all your help and support and we want you to be a part of our vision.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Commissioning and collaboration are essential to an artist’s career. However, student composers and young choreographers are rarely offered opportunities to be professionally commissioned. Fewer still, are the occasions to collaborate across mediums. Music has always been inescapably linked to other mediums, and it has a formidable connection with dance. 7:1 nurtures this connection to stimulate artistic growth. It challenges composers to bounce conceptual ideas back and forth with a choreographer while dancers and instrumentalists learn to be present and engaged in a live performance.</p>
<p>More and more artists are discovering collaborative opportunities in contemporary opera, popular music, sound design, performing arts, film, and visual art. Learning the art of collaboration is a vital professional skill and it is only possible through a hands-on approach; 7:1 allows young artists to get their hands dirty.</p>
<p>Our wider goal is to engage the arts community to take a more active role in the creation and appreciation of interdisciplinary art, specifically new music and dance. New York City has one of the most vibrant arts scenes in the world, we intend to become a part of it.</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div><p>Sharing our campaign on social media and spreading word about it goes a long way!

7:1 was co-founded by Mannes composer, Alexander Chadwell and Rovaco Dance Company choreographer, Rohan Bhargava. These two young artists and entrepreneurs envisioned a collaborative performance project with three goals in mind:

To provide current students at Mannes School of Music an opportunity to be commissioned 
To generate exciting new works of music and dance through a collaboration between composers, instrumentalists, dancers, and one choreographer.
To encourage young and emerging artists to gain a deeper understanding of a medium other than their own.

As a result, 7 Mannes composers were selected to work intimately with Rovaco Dance Company and choreographer Rohan Bhargava. After four months of labor, they have created 7 new works of interdisciplinary art that are now finished and ready to be presented! Come and support the achievements of these artists on Saturday, May 13th at 3 pm at The Auditorium on 66 W. 12th Street, New York, NY. Tickets are free but you can save your seat at: www.sevencolonone.eventbrite.com

What We Need & What You Get
This project needs $7,000 in order to meet its budget and make sure the performance is a success. Here is what we have to pay for:

140 hours of rehearsal space
Hourly wages for dancers
Commissioning award for each composer
Payment for production staff
Costumes
Advertising (posters, postcards, graphic design, printing)
Documentation (audio, video, and photography)

By donating to this project, you get to support interdisciplinary art and avail exciting perks. We are offering benefits such as one-on-one conversations with artists, invitation to future rehearsals, an exclusive dinner with 7:1 founders, and even a weekend trip to Cape Cod with Rovaco Dance! Our goal is to foster meaningful relationships with our patrons and give them insight into our creative process. We want you to know that we appreciate all your help and support and we want you to be a part of our vision.

The Impact
Commissioning and collaboration are essential to an artist’s career. However, student composers and young choreographers are rarely offered opportunities to be professionally commissioned. Fewer still, are the occasions to collaborate across mediums. Music has always been inescapably linked to other mediums, and it has a formidable connection with dance. 7:1 nurtures this connection to stimulate artistic growth. It challenges composers to bounce conceptual ideas back and forth with a choreographer while dancers and instrumentalists learn to be present and engaged in a live performance.
More and more artists are discovering collaborative opportunities in contemporary opera, popular music, sound design, performing arts, film, and visual art. Learning the art of collaboration is a vital professional skill and it is only possible through a hands-on approach; 7:1 allows young artists to get their hands dirty.
Our wider goal is to engage the arts community to take a more active role in the creation and appreciation of interdisciplinary art, specifically new music and dance. New York City has one of the most vibrant arts scenes in the world, we intend to become a part of it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Dance COLEctive (TDC), a Chicago-based dance company, is undertaking a refreshed, project based approach to making and performing dance via solo and collaborative projects initiated via the creative vision and curiosity of Margi Cole, as well as partnering artists. Also dedicated to teaching and mentorship, TDC motivates and nurtures the next generation of artists in the studio and beyond.  REboot serves to realize and advance the company’s new mission.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The Dance COLEctive in collaboration with Third Way Projects presents:</i></p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>The Dance COLEctive needs to raise $5,000 to help support the presentation of this concert.  All the funds we raise will be allocated to paying the people who are integral to the production and performance of this concert, specifically our performers, choreographers, and technical staff. These generous artists contribute immeasurably to the work in the studio and on the stage, and they can never be paid enough for their creative time. Money raised represents about a ⅓ of the overall budget which is supplemented by ticket sales, a few smaller grants and The Dance COLEctive.  </p> <p>$5,000 pays for:</p>
<p><strong>Artist Fees:</strong> $3,800 (2 choreographers, 6 performers)</p>
<p><strong>Technical Crew:</strong>  $1,200 (1 lighting designer, 1 stage manager/crew)</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For more than 22 years The Dance COLEctive has produced high caliber work by Margi Cole and her collaborators.  TDC’s 20th anniversary in 2016 was a significant benchmark that distinguished the company as a Chicago institution.  After inspiring and mentoring so many, TDC has implemented a new programmatic model, retaining its innovative approaches to choreography and performance while transitioning from a set ensemble to a pick-up company model. This change was motivated by Cole’s desire to focus more deeply on artistic exploration with a wider range of performance and collaborative options than the initial company structure allowed.</p>
<p>REboot is the first concert since TDC reshaped its mission and organizational structure. Our interest in collaboration  is our strongest and most constant creative value. This concert exemplifies the artistic growth we have set out to achieve. Your support will enable us to succeed financially,  and, more importantly artistically.  Thank you for considering this opportunity to help keep us thinking, collaborating, making and moving!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Dance COLEctive (TDC), a Chicago-based dance company, is undertaking a refreshed, project based approach to making and performing dance via solo and collaborative projects initiated via the creative vision and curiosity of Margi Cole, as well as partnering artists.

What We Need 
The Dance COLEctive needs to raise $5,000 to help support the presentation of this concert.  All the funds we raise will be allocated to paying the people who are integral to the production and performance of this concert, specifically our performers, choreographers, and technical staff. These generous artists contribute immeasurably to the work in the studio and on the stage, and they can never be paid enough for their creative time. Money raised represents about a ⅓ of the overall budget which is supplemented by ticket sales, a few smaller grants and The Dance COLEctive.   $5,000 pays for:
Artist Fees: $3,800 (2 choreographers, 6 performers)
Technical Crew:  $1,200 (1 lighting designer, 1 stage manager/crew)

The Impact
For more than 22 years The Dance COLEctive has produced high caliber work by Margi Cole and her collaborators.  TDC’s 20th anniversary in 2016 was a significant benchmark that distinguished the company as a Chicago institution.  After inspiring and mentoring so many, TDC has implemented a new programmatic model, retaining its innovative approaches to choreography and performance while transitioning from a set ensemble to a pick-up company model. This change was motivated by Cole’s desire to focus more deeply on artistic exploration with a wider range of performance and collaborative options than the initial company structure allowed.
REboot is the first concert since TDC reshaped its mission and organizational structure. Our interest in collaboration  is our strongest and most constant creative value. This concert exemplifies the artistic growth we have set out to achieve. Your support will enable us to succeed financially,  and, more importantly artistically.  Thank you for considering this opportunity to help keep us thinking, collaborating, making and moving!

<ul><li><strong>Why are we going to Berlin? </strong></li></ul>
<p>As the 1800 Franz von Suppé song goes: ""Du bist verrückt mein Kind, du musst nach Berlin"" (You are crazy, my child. You must go to Berlin). So, we've decided to take our queerness to the ""city of creativity"" in order to create and perform an original work called ""Ignoble Cabaret"". It is a mix of our original repertoire from Queer Songbook with some of the hits performed by Cida Moreira during her widely recognized career as a songstress of the Brechtian repertoire.</p>

<p>""Du bist verrückt mein Kind, du musst nach Berlin"" (Franz Von Suppé, 1800), so heißt es in diesem bekannten Lied. Wir sehen in der ""Stadt der Kreativen"" den idealen Ort um unseren queeren Lebensstil in unserem Stück „Unwürdiges Kabarett"" darzustellen und zu thematisieren. Es ist eine Kombination aus Stücken des „Queeren Liedguts"" mit einigen Liedern von Cida Moreiras, die als Sängerin von Brechts Werken bekannt wurde.</p>

<li>Not only you can guarantee your ticket by purchasing our $15 perk, but you'll also help us pay for general expenses.</li>

<li>LGBTQ art is common in Berlin, a city that – despite a brief moment in its past – is and has been home to queer pioneers, and especially to great queer art! Brazil has been honing generations of very important queer ""artivists"", but the track record of Brazilian society and its acceptance of LGBTQ people has not been so commendable: it is the country with most trans deaths in the world! Our form of political resistance is to spread conscience about this situation happening in Brazil, through art. </li>

Why are we going to Berlin? 
As the 1800 Franz von Suppé song goes: ""Du bist verrückt mein Kind, du musst nach Berlin"" (You are crazy, my child. You must go to Berlin). So, we've decided to take our queerness to the ""city of creativity"" in order to create and perform an original work called ""Ignoble Cabaret"". It is a mix of our original repertoire from Queer Songbook with some of the hits performed by Cida Moreira during her widely recognized career as a songstress of the Brechtian repertoire.

HOW YOU CAN HELP
 
With your support, be it in donation, in spreading the word or even in checking us out on social media and posting about us, we can make this original work happen!

We have secured some of the funding with grants from Brazil, but we still need to pay for some travel expenses, rehearsal spaces, and production fees in Berlin. 
Not only you can guarantee your ticket by purchasing our $15 perk, but you'll also help us pay for general expenses.
If we don't reach everything, any amount we can raise will still help us in paying for a piano rent, and in securing rent for local instruments and theatre

 

WHY CROWDFUNDING?
 

It's not every day that artists from Brazil can cross the ocean to present a work in such a charming theatre like the Delphi (if you don't know it, you can check it out at http://theater-im-delphi.de/). 
In fact, Brazil is undergoing its worst political and economical crisis in history, and art production has suffered dramatically from that, on a national level. ""Cancioneiro Queer"" has been produced independently since its inception, and this is the first time that we receive money from the State Bureau of Culture in Minas Gerais (BR) so that we can tour internationally. 
LGBTQ art is common in Berlin, a city that – despite a brief moment in its past – is and has been home to queer pioneers, and especially to great queer art! Brazil has been honing generations of very important queer ""artivists"", but the track record of Brazilian society and its acceptance of LGBTQ people has not been so commendable: it is the country with most trans deaths in the world! Our form of political resistance is to spread conscience about this situation happening in Brazil, through art.

(CBS News) Sleepwalking is much more common in the U.S. population that previously thought, researchers announced Monday....In a new study, published in the May 15 (2012) issue of the journal, Neurology,
 researchers found about 3.6 percent of U.S. adults - about 8.4 million 
people - sleepwalk each year. What's more, almost 30 percent of adults 
said they've strolled while snoozing at least once throughout their 
lifetime. 
  Why We Do It...
 If you know anything about independent theatre, you know that it is almost always a labor of love and it can't exist without the charity of others. Monitary profit is not familiar term. We do it because we love to art of storytelling, we love to entertain, but most of all, we love to help and inspire others!!!

Asterism Theatre Company presents the world premiere of Trey K. Blackburn's The Great Somewhere.
Coming in fall 2015 to a downtown theatre near you!




A tornado strikes a small Iowa town, and the Woodridge children come home to clean up and search for their parents. Estranged by time, distance, and perspective, brothers Clark and Hudson attempt to rekindle their connection in the the face of devastation. But when Hudson refuses to be the best man in Clark's upcoming wedding to his partner, Roger, the sibling's unyielding beliefs threaten to blow their home and family apart.
What happens when the home you grew up in is destroyed by the forces of nature and belief? If you've ever journeyed away from your place of birth, only to find you can't quite shake it off of your pant leg, this play is for you.





About Asterism Theatre Company


 

We're emerging artists and we believe it's important to support and work with other emerging artists. That means creating opportunities within our company for unheard, untried, untested voices.

We believe that a play should be treated with as much respect as a person, and that it is only through examining a text from all angles that it will be able to truly able to stand up and walk on its own.

We believe in creating the maximum theatrical experience with a minimum of material elements. 


We believe there's room for everyone's story. We desperately want our work to reflect a broad range of experiences, backgrounds, and viewpoints that are underrepresented in modern theatre.

We believe theatre should be, first and foremost, a product of and for the community. The work of Asterism is to reflect the joys and challenges of the communities we live in.





    

What We Need & What You Get
We'll be real with you: starting a theatre company is no easy task. Fortunately, both of us are as frugal as we are creative. We're asking for $10,000, which will allow us to produce The Great Somewhere as well as ensure Asterism is around for years to come. Here's where your money will go:


Pay for a venue (We love poor theatre, but it would be nice to have a roof over our heads. And the audience's)


Compensate our actors (They're the heartbeat of ourproject.)


Hire a production staff (Including designers, a stage manager, and a running crew)

Create a publicity campaign (Have you ever been to a show with no audience? It's sad.)

Secure props & costumes (We've never sent anyone onstage without clothing - at least not accidentally - and we're not about to start now)


Book rehearsal space (Our spacious New York apartments aren't exactly ideal for making theatre.)

Purchase insurance (Safety first!)

Last, but not least:


We have plans. Big plans. After producing The Great Somewhere, any money that is left over will be used to fund future projects and fulfill our additional aim of bringing theatre to rural and urban communities that don't have ready access to it.


Know that we intend to produce The Great Somewhere regardless of whether we reach our monetary goal, and ever penny you donate will go towards realizing this play and launching our fledgling company.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">How far would you go for a moment of human
connection? What would you do to feel the touch of another? In a world poised on the brink of self-destruction, where humans
have divided, isolated and quarantined each other, this is the story of four people.
How they lived, loved, and died. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p>
<p><b>What Is Going On?</b><br/></p><p>This play is poetic, vicious, and unrelenting. And so beautiful
it makes my heart ache. </p>
<p>This project and I have been simmering together for almost a
decade, waiting for the right time to make it a reality. This is the time. Our
world is struggling more and more with making human connections. There is so
much that distances and divides us: from the small to the large, the addictions
to screens to the political affiliations. This seems like a good time to be
reminded that we’re all human, and we all – when we get right down to it – want
more or less the same things. </p><p>We all know the devastation of loneliness. We all
know the sting of feeling like you don’t belong. </p>
<p><b>Who Are We?</b></p>
<p>I’m Virginia. If we haven’t met yet, hopefully we will soon.
I’m one of the Co-Artistic Directors of <b>mad/magic</b>,
the company producing this play. In fact, it’s our inaugural production. And actually, this play was the impetus behind us forming the company to begin with. My
co-conspirator (and the other Co-Artistic Director) is Rebecca. </p>

How far would you go for a moment of human
connection? What would you do to feel the touch of another? In a world poised on the brink of self-destruction, where humans
have divided, isolated and quarantined each other, this is the story of four people.
How they lived, loved, and died. 
What Is Going On?This play is poetic, vicious, and unrelenting. And so beautiful
it makes my heart ache. 
This project and I have been simmering together for almost a
decade, waiting for the right time to make it a reality. This is the time. Our
world is struggling more and more with making human connections. There is so
much that distances and divides us: from the small to the large, the addictions
to screens to the political affiliations. This seems like a good time to be
reminded that we’re all human, and we all – when we get right down to it – want
more or less the same things. We all know the devastation of loneliness. We all
know the sting of feeling like you don’t belong. 
Who Are We?
I’m Virginia. If we haven’t met yet, hopefully we will soon.
I’m one of the Co-Artistic Directors of mad/magic,
the company producing this play. In fact, it’s our inaugural production. And actually, this play was the impetus behind us forming the company to begin with. My
co-conspirator (and the other Co-Artistic Director) is Rebecca. 
This project is the collaborative effort of 6 fantastic
humans: me, Rebecca Robertson, Paul Corning Jr., Casey Jordan, Leon Ingulsrud,
and Benita de Wit. I am humbled beyond words to be in the creative presence of
these talented people.
How Can You Help?

production. It’s very important to us that this show is accessible to anybody, so our
tickets are donation-only. 
We are, however, trying to cover cost…$3500, to be exact.

<p>Hello! My name is Aleksandr and I am an illusionist. To
become a professional magician was my dream since I was a little boy. So, being
8 years old I started trying “magic things” and now, after 15 years, for me this
is a lot more than just a hobby. This is what I want to move forward. With my
skill I would like to show people how magical our world is! For this purpose I
created a project called “<b>Magic lives
inside you</b>”. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>THE PROJECT CONSISTS
OF 2 MAIN PARTS:</b></p>
<p>1)<span> “Magic theatre”; children and teenagers with different backgrounds will be given a chance to learn magic performances and to become closer to their dream. </span></p>
<p>2)<span> 
</span>An illusion show; it will include new magic tricks I have been working on for 6 years.</p>
<p><b>WHY IS THIS SO
IMPORTANT FOR ME?</b></p>
<p>I still can remember my emotions when I saw a magic
trick for the first time. Since that moment, I always wanted people to be
astonished by my skill. I wanted to ring their bells with my art. That is why I
decided to engage myself in magic career. Nothing ever makes me so happy but
when people start to believe in a miracle just like I did many years ago. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446444845/btdcpj129s4nrwvlmqhw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Thanks to you support, children and teenagers with different
backgrounds will be given a chance to learn magic performances, choreography,
art of acting and much more. They will be participating in international magic contests.
In other words, helping me with this project you give thousands of people a chance
to believe in a miracle.</p>
<p><b>WHAT IS THIS
“MAGIC THEATRE” ABOUT?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>I organize charity concerts in orphanages, perform in child
centers, but this is nothing in comparison with the fact that children will be
able to learn this wonderful and mystic art themselves.</p>
<p>Just ask yourself this simple question: “When you were a child, did you want to become a magician?”<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446444887/oqg36kycp1uihrzxbc7w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">So,</span><br/></p>
<p>1) There will be annual concerts in the theatre, where
pupils will be demonstrating their progress.</p>
<p>2) Learning in the “Magic theatre” children will be
able to participate in international magic contests. </p>
<p>3) In the “Magic theatre” children will be developing such
good qualities as attentiveness, creativity, artistry and communication skills.
</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>AM I CAPABLE OF
CARRYING OUT THE PROJECT?</b></p>

<p>Remember, miracles happen when you believe

</div></div>","Hello! My name is Aleksandr and I am an illusionist. To
become a professional magician was my dream since I was a little boy. So, being
8 years old I started trying “magic things” and now, after 15 years, for me this
is a lot more than just a hobby. This is what I want to move forward. With my
skill I would like to show people how magical our world is! For this purpose I
created a project called “Magic lives
inside you”. 

THE PROJECT CONSISTS
OF 2 MAIN PARTS:
1) “Magic theatre”; children and teenagers with different backgrounds will be given a chance to learn magic performances and to become closer to their dream. 
2) 
An illusion show; it will include new magic tricks I have been working on for 6 years.
WHY IS THIS SO
IMPORTANT FOR ME?
I still can remember my emotions when I saw a magic
trick for the first time. Since that moment, I always wanted people to be
astonished by my skill. I wanted to ring their bells with my art. That is why I
decided to engage myself in magic career. Nothing ever makes me so happy but
when people start to believe in a miracle just like I did many years ago. 


Thanks to you support, children and teenagers with different
backgrounds will be given a chance to learn magic performances, choreography,
art of acting and much more. They will be participating in international magic contests.
In other words, helping me with this project you give thousands of people a chance
to believe in a miracle.
WHAT IS THIS
“MAGIC THEATRE” ABOUT?

I organize charity concerts in orphanages, perform in child
centers, but this is nothing in comparison with the fact that children will be
able to learn this wonderful and mystic art themselves.
Just ask yourself this simple question: “When you were a child, did you want to become a magician?”


So,
1) There will be annual concerts in the theatre, where
pupils will be demonstrating their progress.
2) Learning in the “Magic theatre” children will be
able to participate in international magic contests. 
3) In the “Magic theatre” children will be developing such
good qualities as attentiveness, creativity, artistry and communication skills.


AM I CAPABLE OF
CARRYING OUT THE PROJECT?

I have been mastering my skill for 15 years and, consequently,
I have gained valuable experience and achieved noticeable results. Some of them
are:
1) 
2006 - I was accepted
to the “Closed community of illusionists”.
2) 
2012 - I won the
second prize in Russian contest, nomination “Pop-Circus Art”, Moscow.
3) 
2013 – I became a
champion of Russia in “Pop-Circus Art”, Moscow.
4) 
During all these
15 years I have been learning from the greatest magicians such as:
David Stone, France – an actor, illusionist and film
director;
Henry Evans, Argentina – an illusionist, magic tricks
champion of the world 2000;
Shawn Farquhar, USA – an illusionist, magic tricks
champion of the world 2009.


To carry out the project at least 35 000$ are
needed. All the money received will be used for processing papers, creating a web-site,
renting of a premise for rehearsals, renting of a venue, soundman’s work,
tailoring of onstage dresses for children, purchasing of handout materials for
children to be able to learn tricks on early stages. 
In case I do not have enough amount of money, I am not
going to give up. Any money received will be useful to start my project’s carrying
out. 
Provided
that you cannot help me financially, I would appreciate if you told people
about my project in social networks such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. I will
be pleased to know that you are in.

we are trying to raise the funds to ensure that our show is as great as it can possibly
be! This includes:</span></p>
<div>
<div>
<p>1) The cost of rehearsal spaces. We are lucky enough to have
a space to rehearse in the majority of the time, but during times it is not
free we have to rent out other spaces. As we all know, space rentals in
Manhattan are unbelievably expensive! <br/>
2) Giving our cast and crew the money they deserve. We originally included a small stipend for actors in our original budget, but we believe that our amazing actors, designers, stage managers, and run crew should earn more than the amount of a monthly MetroPass for all of their hard work. <br/>
3) Fireproofing our set and props (Who knew fireproofing was
a thing? We obviously didn’t!)<br/>
4) Paying for our insurance. FringeNYC is generous enough to offer accident liability insurance at a discounted rate, but the cost was still slightly more than we budgeted for.</p>
<p>Any amount raised will help with the above costs, as well as
covering any unforeseen expenses that come up during the production. There is
no amount too small (or too large) to help!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary From What's That Spooky Noise? Productions, creators of ""This is Boring, Nothing's Happening"", ""Playing Pretend"", and ""Shut-Ins"" comes ""GALACTIC"": A new space musical adventure.
GALACTIC is the story of a team of dedicated space explorers trapped on a desolate planet while on a heroic mission. When their food supply is compromised, the explorers are left with nothing but their knowledge, wits, and each other to survive. At it's core, GALACTIC is a character-based story in an interesting setting, fuelled by fun, energetic, original songs and audio-visual effects.
The show will be performed in Saint John, New Brunswick August 16-21 as part of the Fundy Fringe Festival, and in Halifax, Nova Scotia (dates announced soon!).   What We Need & What You Get Our $600 goal is the minimum we need to execute our vision:



$350 for venue rentals and festival entry fees.

$200 for art department: costumes, props, set pieces, makeup, audio-visual material production.
$50 for print and digital marketing materials.

This is in addition to the production team's own personal investments and further fundraising initiatives. Anything raised above the $600 goal will increase the value of the production.
    The Impact This is the third major stage production for Spooky Noise and this time around we really want to raise the bar. This is by far our most ambitious project and with your contribution, our vision can be executed lightyears beyond our expectations!
We can't wait for audiences in Saint John and Halifax to see this show, and with your support we also aim to have the production professionally recorded so everyone can see it!
    Risks & Challenges Putting on such an ambitious musical with such a low budget comes with many risks and challenges. We always aim to raise the bar with each production and this time around is no different. GALACTIC includes audio-visual elements, lighting and sound cues, digital projections, physical effects such as fog and lasers, and puppets. This is a lot for a team of 4 to handle, but with your support and our experience we can make it happen!

   What We Need & What You Get El proyecto ""Nadando entre Nudos"" necesita $20,000 para poder montarse. El show requiere de un equipo técnico que lo cree, organice y promueva; vestuario, músicos, personal administrativo, entre otros. 
El éxito del show significaría abrirle las puertas a Giulia al mundo y otorgarle el deseo de volver a Europa a perfeccionar su técnica y aprender nuevas cosas; le daría la oportunidad de poder hacerse un nombre en el mundo artístico que le permita enseñar, crear coreografías y hacer nuevos shows junto a las principales figuras del Flamenco.
Todo el dinero recaudado por este medio será destinado al pago de la puesta en escena en su totalidad y, de quedar un excedente, a financiar un nuevo viaje para Giulia Risso a España, Argentina o Chile, donde más se práctica el Flamenco en el mundo. 
Contamos para este show con la ayuda y la confianza de artistas reconocidos como Mercè Grané, a cargo de la dirección general, Ernesto Hermoza, reconocido guitarrista peruano a cargo de la dirección musical, y Jorge Pérez, líder de la banda Patax a cargo de la percusión.

""Nadando entre Nudos"" needs $20,000 to launch. The show requires a technique team to create, organize and promote it; dressing, musicians, managing personel, and more. 
The success of this show would mean the opening of the world to Giulia and granting her the oportunity to go back to Europe to master her technique and lear new things; it would give her a name in the artistic world that could lead her to teaching, creat choreographies and set new shows by the side of leading figures of the Flamenco world.
All the money we get through this channel will go entirely to the payment of the show and, if we get to have a revenue, to finance a new adventure for Giulia Risso in Spain, Argentina or Chile, countries where Flamenco is very popular.
Well known artists like Mercè Grané, direction, Ernesto Hermoza, distinguished peruvian guitarist in charge of musical direction, and Jorge Pérez, leader of the band Patax in charge of percussion, are working now with us and trusting us on this adventure.

<h3>THE STORY</h3> <p></p>
<p>Welcome to the online headquarters of the
world premiere staging of <i>BABY FAT: Act
I: A Screeching Weasel Rock Opera</i>. Here is where you will find the latest
updates about the production, in addition to information about how to play a
vital role in making this production happen. By becoming a donor, you will be
supporting the livelihoods of all the working artists involved as well as being
a part of history by contributing to this world premiere one-of-a-kind punk
rock opera.</p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<p>La MaMa
presents in association with Columbia Stages the world premiere advance staging
of a November Theatre production - <b><i>BABY
FAT: Act I</i></b>, a Screeching Weasel Rock Opera. <b><i>BABY FAT: Act I </i></b>boasts music and lyrics by <b>Ben Weasel</b> of Screeching Weasel (“Cool
Kids”) and libretto by <b>Ben Weasel </b>(after
Victor Hugo and Francesco Maria Piave). <b>Michael
Scholar, Jr. </b>(<i>The Black Rider</i>) directs this ambitious thesis
production, scheduled for a strictly limited engagement at La MaMa’s Ellen
Stewart Theatre at 66 East 4<sup>th</sup> Street, NYC from July 21 – July 23.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With <b><i>BABY FAT: Act I</i></b>, Verdi's classic opera <i>Rigoletto</i> gets a punk
rock overhaul by iconic frontman Ben Weasel of Screeching
Weasel. In this world premiere, we find ourselves in The Reptile House, a
Chicago club where the house band Serpentello and its entourage are at the center of
a dark vortex of debauchery from which seemingly no soul can
escape unharmed.</p>
<p>Of Screeching Weasel and about the
production, director <b>Michael Scholar,
Jr. </b>says, “I saw that one of my favorite bands was putting out a theatrical
album. Listening to it, I got it right away and was blown away. I could see
how this piece should look, and I wanted to bring it to the stage.”</p>Ben Weasel
of Screeching Weasel writes about how excited he is to see <b><i>BABY FAT: Act I</i> </b>come to the stage: “If I were British I’d be
chuffed; a Californian, stoked; Audrey Hepburn, delighted! After thirty years
of composing music and lyrics for rock albums, I can’t wait to take on the challenge
of writing for the theatre. Michael’s track record in combining rock and
theatre has gained my trust and confidence in his ability to bring <i>Baby Fat</i> to vivid life on the stage.”</div><div><br/></div><div>

THE BUDGET

While this ambitious project is bringing
together the artistic support of Columbia Stages, La MaMa, and November
Theatre, we still need the contributions of superfans and progressive theatrelovers
like you. By donating to this campaign, you can directly impact the look,
sound, and feel of this awesome production. Funds that we raise through
Indiegogo will go directly to the artists’ fees and production costs to make
this event a kick-ass night for everyone.

<p>Don’t Drink The Water captures the story of Janae Turner, a young restraunt owner who is still trying to find her footing 11 years after Katrina destroyed her family’s bar. Determined to revive the Lower Ninth Ward, Janae considers herself a rock in the community. With the help of her guardian and friends, she selflessly pours herself into the rehabilitation of her neighbourhood through cooking up some of the best food in the city. That is until a young rapper named Clyde walks into her bar. Head in the clouds and feet buried deep in the ground, Clyde is set on having a career successful enough to acquire a small beach house in Ghana. But after booking a gig at Janae’s bar, those clouds begin to clear, and his heart begins to fall for her. Things appear to be stable until an unexpected guest, looking for more than she deserves, finds her way into Janae’s bar. Love, greed, and a an imminent feeling of hopelessness soon begin to overtake the story, leaving Clyde and Janae with a multitude of choices, including moving away from Louisiana, revoking childhood promises, and giving up the bar. However, Janae ends up with more help than she needs, receiving guidance from a very wild collection of spirits ordered to protect her.  Set to a soundtrack of live hip-hop and soul and intermixed with the Creole and African traditions of voodoo, Don’t Drink The Water explores the damaging effects of Katrina, gentrification, and love, all while exploring what we chose to hold onto and what happens when we finally let it go. Through dance, song, a vicious game of dominoes, this play forces a confrontation of Louisiana’s past and present, leaving it’s future up for major discussion.</p>
<p>The money raised through this campaign will allow for a two day rehearsed reading of this play, which will provide industry contacts for both the actors as well as the writer. Proper exposure is key in the success of new works, and rehearsed readings have been known to be the jumping off point for many of the contemporary theatre shows we witness today. Your contributions will allow for a London based venue, production team, music rights and everything else that comes along with producing a new piece of theatre. All of the artists currently attached the project have put in countless hours to bring this play to life, and with your help, we can finally take our next step. No donation is too small, and with a list of rewards ranging form <strong>signed posters</strong> to <strong>drunken cooking segments</strong>, the incentive to donate couldn’t be more exciting! Also part of the proceeds will go to charities who's main goal is to rehabilate the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans.</p>

<p>We are about to open the second season in our, and your, independent Khashabi Theatre in Haifa, which we inaugurated on October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2015. We concluded the first season with a significant theatrical and artistic success, and we witnessed a tangible and visible support to our newborn project from our audience. But there was a small problem that we do not want to it to accompany us in the second season, which will open on October/December of this year, which is the amphitheater.</p>
<p>Before we inaugurated the theater, we launched a crowd funding campaign on "" Indiegogo"" platform to raise funds for the restoration of the Ottoman building in Wadi Al Saleeb neighborhood Haifa, which we turned later into a theater, and a home for our art group and for Palestinian artists who want to produce and present their work in this theater. This campaign has gathered around us a great deal of support for the opening of theater and the pursuit towards its continuity, and this made us realize the important of the public support in the success and sustainability of any independent cultural project<span dir=""RTL"">.</span></p>

<p dir=""RTL"">خدمنا مدرّج خشبة مدّة موسم عروض من ستة أشهر، لكنّ كثيرين اشتكوا من جلسته غير المريحة، والتي تستمرّ خلال العروض لأكثر من ساعة. بالمقابل، سمعنا وكتب لنا وقيل عن الموسم آراء مشجّعة ومقدّرة وتشرح الصدر. فقد قمنا خلال هذا الموسم، الذي حمل عنوان ""حيفا بين الماضي والحاضر""، بإنتاج عملين مسرحيين كانا نتاج بحثٍ حثيث في تاريخ المدينة وحاضرها، ونتاج مختبر مسرحيّ دخل إليه أعضاء انسمبل خشبة، وهما"" ""ستّ بالأفّة"" (عشاء مسرحيّ) و""سنة الثلجة"". كما تعاوننا في إنتاج أعمال فنيّة صديقة، تبادلنا معها ثقافيًّا. كنا شركاء في مهرجان حيفا المستقل للأفلام بدورته الأولى، واستضفنا عروضًا في حقول فنيّة مختلفة كالموسيقى والشعر والسينما.</p>
<p dir=""RTL"">في موسمنا الثاني، الذي يملأنا حماسةً ونشاطًا، أولا كوننا مستمرين في مشروعنا الذي طالما كان حلمًا، وهذا ليس بالأمر السهل. ثانيًا، لأنّ الموسم، الذي يحمل عنوان ""الهوية""، حافلٌ بالمشاريع المثيرة: كتأسيس الدورة الأولى من مهرجان ""رَ"" للعرض الأدائيّ القصير، الذي سيموّل اقتراحات مشاريع لعروض أدائيّة ويقدمها في مهرجان سيجوب حيفا ورام الله والقدس. كما سينتج المسرح عملاً مسرحيّا يضم فنانين فلسطينيين من مختلف جغرافيا التواجد الفلسطينيّ. هذا بالإضافة إلى الإنتاجات التي سيتعاون المسرح في تقديمها مع فنانين أصدقاء، والعروض المختلفة التي سيستضيفها.</p>
<p>Our current amphitheater in Khashabi had served us during our first six-months season, but many from our audience complained that the seats are uncomfortable, especially when the show is running for more than an hour. On the other hand, we heard and received a lot of encouraging and heartwarming reviews from our audience about our work. During the first season ""Haifa between the past and the present,"" we produced two playwrights that were the outcome of a deep research in the city's history and present, and also the product of a theatrical “laboratory” that the members of Khashabi Ensemble worked inside it. We cooperated with fellow artists in the production of their projects, we were partners in the first Haifa Independent Film Festival, and we hosted exibisions and performances in various artistic fields such as music, poetry, etc..</p>
<p>On the outskirts of our second season, we are very enthusiastic and hopeful, first because we are sustaining and continuing our project which was a long-lived dream coming true, and not so easily. Second, because the next season, which is under the title ""Identity"", is full of exciting projects, such as launching the first edition of ""Ra"" Festival for Short Performances, which will fund the precaution of project proposals for short art performances and its presentation in Haifa, Ramallah and Jerusalem. Khashabi Theatre will also produce a theatrical work featuring Palestinian artists from various places in the Palestine and the diaspora. This is in addition to theater productions, where Khashabi will partner with other fellow artists in producing and presenting it<span dir=""RTL"">.</span></p>

<p dir=""RTL""><strong>أين نحن ماديًّا؟ </strong></p>
<p dir=""RTL"">إنّ المدرّج الذي سنقوم ببنائه سيكلّف المسرح ما يقارب <span dir=""LTR"">15,440</span> دولار أمريكي. تمكّنا حتّى الآن من الحصول  على جزء صغير من المبلغ الإجماليّ. لا نراه مبلغًا مستحيلا، بل نستطيع من خلال آيّ مساهمة من كلّ فرد منكم آن نحصّله.    </p>
<p dir=""RTL"">حضر الموسم الأوّل أكثر من 4 آلاف مشاهد. ونحن على ثقة بأنّ الموسم الثاني سيستقبل عددًا أكبر من المشاهدين المهتمين في المسرح والفنون بشكل عام. كلّ هؤلاء سيجلسون على مقاعد مريحة إن لم تمكّنا من خلال هذه الحملة من الحصول على التمويل الكافي لبناء مدرّجنا الجديد.</p>
<p><strong>What is our financial status<span dir=""RTL"">?</span></strong></p>
<p>The amphitheater that we plan to build will cost approximately USD 15,440. So far we have been able to raise a small portion of the total amount. We believe that it is possible to raise the total amount, and any support receive from any of you will contribute to reaching our goal<span dir=""RTL"">.</span></p>
<p>More than four thousand people attended Khashabi Theatre shows during the first season. We believe that more people who are interested in theater and art in general will attend the second season. It is very important for us to build the new seats in order to be able to provide comfortable seating for our audience<span dir=""RTL"">.</span></p>

في موسمنا الثاني، الذي يملأنا حماسةً ونشاطًا، أولا كوننا مستمرين في مشروعنا الذي طالما كان حلمًا، وهذا ليس بالأمر السهل. ثانيًا، لأنّ الموسم، الذي يحمل عنوان ""الهوية""، حافلٌ بالمشاريع المثيرة: كتأسيس الدورة الأولى من مهرجان ""رَ"" للعرض الأدائيّ القصير، الذي سيموّل اقتراحات مشاريع لعروض أدائيّة ويقدمها في مهرجان سيجوب حيفا ورام الله والقدس. كما سينتج المسرح عملاً مسرحيّا يضم فنانين فلسطينيين من مختلف جغرافيا التواجد الفلسطينيّ. هذا بالإضافة إلى الإنتاجات التي سيتعاون المسرح في تقديمها مع فنانين أصدقاء، والعروض المختلفة التي سيستضيفها.
Our current amphitheater in Khashabi had served us during our first six-months season, but many from our audience complained that the seats are uncomfortable, especially when the show is running for more than an hour. On the other hand, we heard and received a lot of encouraging and heartwarming reviews from our audience about our work. During the first season ""Haifa between the past and the present,"" we produced two playwrights that were the outcome of a deep research in the city's history and present, and also the product of a theatrical “laboratory” that the members of Khashabi Ensemble worked inside it. We cooperated with fellow artists in the production of their projects, we were partners in the first Haifa Independent Film Festival, and we hosted exibisions and performances in various artistic fields such as music, poetry, etc..
On the outskirts of our second season, we are very enthusiastic and hopeful, first because we are sustaining and continuing our project which was a long-lived dream coming true, and not so easily. Second, because the next season, which is under the title ""Identity"", is full of exciting projects, such as launching the first edition of ""Ra"" Festival for Short Performances, which will fund the precaution of project proposals for short art performances and its presentation in Haifa, Ramallah and Jerusalem. Khashabi Theatre will also produce a theatrical work featuring Palestinian artists from various places in the Palestine and the diaspora. This is in addition to theater productions, where Khashabi will partner with other fellow artists in producing and presenting it.

أين نحن ماديًّا؟ 
إنّ المدرّج الذي سنقوم ببنائه سيكلّف المسرح ما يقارب 15,440 دولار أمريكي. تمكّنا حتّى الآن من الحصول  على جزء صغير من المبلغ الإجماليّ. لا نراه مبلغًا مستحيلا، بل نستطيع من خلال آيّ مساهمة من كلّ فرد منكم آن نحصّله.    
حضر الموسم الأوّل أكثر من 4 آلاف مشاهد. ونحن على ثقة بأنّ الموسم الثاني سيستقبل عددًا أكبر من المشاهدين المهتمين في المسرح والفنون بشكل عام. كلّ هؤلاء سيجلسون على مقاعد مريحة إن لم تمكّنا من خلال هذه الحملة من الحصول على التمويل الكافي لبناء مدرّجنا الجديد.
What is our financial status?
The amphitheater that we plan to build will cost approximately USD 15,440. So far we have been able to raise a small portion of the total amount. We believe that it is possible to raise the total amount, and any support receive from any of you will contribute to reaching our goal.
More than four thousand people attended Khashabi Theatre shows during the first season. We believe that more people who are interested in theater and art in general will attend the second season. It is very important for us to build the new seats in order to be able to provide comfortable seating for our audience.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Howie begins the story. The Rookie concludes it.Mark O'Rowe's Howie the Rookie is an epic tale. A wild, urban odyssey through a nightmarish landscape, hilarious, grotesque and, finally, deeply moving and touching.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>A kaleidoscopic array of characters including Ladyboy, a psychotic thug on a quest to avenge the deaths of his Siamese fighting fish. Malodorous adrenaline-junkies Flann Dingle and Ginger Boy, Avalanche, a ski-panted monster looking for love, the tragic Mouse, the scabies-afflicted Peaches. And the Howie. And the Rookie.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>one hell of a story.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i><b>“Mr. O'Rowe...is fierce with talent... one of those rare, shiver-making instances in which language seems to become truly physical""</b></i></strong></p>
<h3><strong>How did this happen?</strong></h3>
<p><strong><b>Jared:</b></strong></p>
<p><i>I had the opportunity to see Howie the Rookie while studying in Ireland in 2013. I was blown away. The ferocity at which the actor attacked the text. It was like being in a boxing match, but I didn't know who was winning. The language of the play at first was a road block to comprehension. Very thick irish/dublin accent. Shortly into the play though my ears automatically adjusted and I held on for a wild ride. At the end of the play I sat in the theatre crying and mesmerized by what I had just witnessed. Eventually the usher kicked me out of the theatre and I knew then I needed to direct this show. It's beyond a want. It's a need. </i></p>
<p><i>I hope to recreate that same feeling I had sitting in that theatre that night. Completely transfixed and in awe.</i></p>
<p><strong><b>Nevan:</b></strong></p>
<p><strong><i><b>""Describe the show.""</b></i></strong></p>
<p><i>One word: Kinetic</i></p>
<p><i>It’s Physical. It keeps moving, keeps building and doesn’t let up. You are thrown in at the beginning and it doesn’t let go for an hour and half.</i></p>
<p><i>You are going to go for a ride.</i></p>
<p><i>If I’m not exhausted and sweating at the end of each and every show, I haven’t done it right.</i></p>
<p><i>A down and dirty dark comedy.</i></p>
<p><i>It’s got swearing, blood, sex, raunchiness, tears…it’s got everything.</i></p>
<p><i>A very different show, and  a lot of fun.</i></p>
<p><strong><b>Eleanor:</b></strong></p>
<p><strong><b><i>""What did you think?""</i></b></strong></p>
<p><i>I was scared of it. And that’s why I liked it.</i></p>
<p><i>So peculiar and gritty and dirty and in your face. It's saying “I’m here and you better pay attention.”</i></p>
<p><i>Challenge yourself and you will be entertained.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong><b><strong><b>Natalie:</b></strong></b></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong><b><strong><b></b></strong></b></strong></p>
<p><strong><b><strong><b><i>""What did you think of the play after your very first read?""</i></b></strong></b></strong></p>
<p><i>I thought that this show is the kind of theatre that I've been missing; it is the kind of theatre that a lot of us have been missing. It is a thrill to encounter a play where the spectacle lies in such a rich text, that is fierce, shameless, hilarious, and oddly heartbreaking all at once. I was uncomfortable, and I immediately started reading it again.</i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i></i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>""What do you hope people take from it?""</b></p>
<p><i>I hope that it causes people to consider the roots of theatre that was less about the big budgets and more about telling real stories. I was taught that the purpose of theatre according to the Greeks was to take events that were unbearable, and in putting them onstage, enable both artists and audience to find a way to make life bearable again. I believe this show is capable of such catharsis.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><b>From the Irish Times:</b></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i><b>“Mark O'Rowe is best known for the verbal pyrotechnics of his monologue plays, dark narratives full of spectacular imagery and linguistic experiment. In Howie the Rookie, his 1999 breakthrough, two young men narrate an odyssey through Dublin that is Shakespearean in its poetry and Jacobean in its arc of bloody revenge.""</b></i></strong></p>

The Howie begins the story. The Rookie concludes it.Mark O'Rowe's Howie the Rookie is an epic tale. A wild, urban odyssey through a nightmarish landscape, hilarious, grotesque and, finally, deeply moving and touching.
A kaleidoscopic array of characters including Ladyboy, a psychotic thug on a quest to avenge the deaths of his Siamese fighting fish. Malodorous adrenaline-junkies Flann Dingle and Ginger Boy, Avalanche, a ski-panted monster looking for love, the tragic Mouse, the scabies-afflicted Peaches. And the Howie. And the Rookie.
one hell of a story.
“Mr. O'Rowe...is fierce with talent... one of those rare, shiver-making instances in which language seems to become truly physical""
How did this happen?
Jared:
I had the opportunity to see Howie the Rookie while studying in Ireland in 2013. I was blown away. The ferocity at which the actor attacked the text. It was like being in a boxing match, but I didn't know who was winning. The language of the play at first was a road block to comprehension. Very thick irish/dublin accent. Shortly into the play though my ears automatically adjusted and I held on for a wild ride. At the end of the play I sat in the theatre crying and mesmerized by what I had just witnessed. Eventually the usher kicked me out of the theatre and I knew then I needed to direct this show. It's beyond a want. It's a need. 
I hope to recreate that same feeling I had sitting in that theatre that night. Completely transfixed and in awe.
Nevan:
""Describe the show.""
One word: Kinetic
It’s Physical. It keeps moving, keeps building and doesn’t let up. You are thrown in at the beginning and it doesn’t let go for an hour and half.
You are going to go for a ride.
If I’m not exhausted and sweating at the end of each and every show, I haven’t done it right.
A down and dirty dark comedy.
It’s got swearing, blood, sex, raunchiness, tears…it’s got everything.
A very different show, and  a lot of fun.
Eleanor:
""What did you think?""
I was scared of it. And that’s why I liked it.
So peculiar and gritty and dirty and in your face. It's saying “I’m here and you better pay attention.”
Challenge yourself and you will be entertained.
Natalie:

""What did you think of the play after your very first read?""
I thought that this show is the kind of theatre that I've been missing; it is the kind of theatre that a lot of us have been missing. It is a thrill to encounter a play where the spectacle lies in such a rich text, that is fierce, shameless, hilarious, and oddly heartbreaking all at once. I was uncomfortable, and I immediately started reading it again.

""What do you hope people take from it?""
I hope that it causes people to consider the roots of theatre that was less about the big budgets and more about telling real stories. I was taught that the purpose of theatre according to the Greeks was to take events that were unbearable, and in putting them onstage, enable both artists and audience to find a way to make life bearable again. I believe this show is capable of such catharsis.

From the Irish Times:
“Mark O'Rowe is best known for the verbal pyrotechnics of his monologue plays, dark narratives full of spectacular imagery and linguistic experiment. In Howie the Rookie, his 1999 breakthrough, two young men narrate an odyssey through Dublin that is Shakespearean in its poetry and Jacobean in its arc of bloody revenge.""

The Factory Theatre is here to create opportunities where actor, artist, and audience member all take part and revel in the shared experience inherent in live theatre. Seeking work that hits us instinctually, emotionally, and intellectually. Preferably in that order.  The Factory Theatre achieves this by focusing on what makes theatre an event to be witnessed. Choosing to remind us that we are all participants, audience and actors, taking part in real magic.

What We Need
Theatre requires only three things to exist.


Something to say.
A place to say it.
Someone to say it to.


- We have something to say
- We have a place to say it
- AND WE WANT TO SAY IT TO YOU! 
And with your support we can bring this story to you. With your donation we can fully form this show as it should be. This show is a back to basics, minimal set, no props, lo-fi show. But even with that, we need your support.
Our expenses are small, but ever present:
- Rehearsal Space rental
- Performance Space rental
- Performance Rights
- Lights
- Set pieces
It is our hope that ticket sales will help off set these expenses, but we know ticket sales alone are not enough. With your donation of $25 or more you get your ticket for the show plus other perks. 
*If you were planning on going, or are now thinking of going, why not support us by prepaying for your tickets now and get some bonuses!
Where will the money go?
We have been honored with a fiscal sponsorship through Fractured Atlas.

Fractured Atlas is a non-profit organization whose mission is to empower artists, arts organizations, and other cultural sector stakeholders by eliminating practical barriers to artistic expression, so as to foster a more agile and resilient cultural ecosystem.
What does that mean?
EVERY single dollar/item given in support of Howie the Rookie is now tax-deductible through this fantastic fiscal sponsorship!
More importantly we have the support and endorsement of a fantastic organization that is doing good for the arts at large and is providing the mentoring for future plans and mission of The Factory Theatre.
                                                                            
The Larger PictureHowie the Rookie marks the second stage in the larger 3 Stage Factory Plan for The Factory Theatre.The 3 Stage Plan Stage 1: The EnsembleIn 2012 The Factory Theatre put on the English World Premier of Jean-Michel Ribe's Theatre Without Animals. This was show whole dedicated to the ensemble. It featured 8 different pieces all told through the ensemble of 5 actors. This was a perfect show to showcase the group, not individuals.  A strong ensemble show is a staple of any theatre's repertoire. Stage 2: The SoloIn 2016 with Mark O' Rowe's Howie the Rookie, The Factory Theatre will take on another staple of any theatre's repertoire. The Solo Show. This production will showcase the talents of a single actor who will carry the show on their shoulders.             Stage 3: The EventIn the final stage The Factory Theatre will take on a large scale event that will require support from many unlikely sources, in hopes of bringing people of different backgrounds, skills, and experiences together for a festival celebrating the event of theatre. By concluding this third stage The Factory Theatre wants to prove that regardless the model or type of show or event, we are capable of creating a shared experience and have turned spectators into participants.Your support for this show goes further than just this production. You are investing in us and future theatre productions. Your support means that more of the ticket sales can go to the next big event instead of just paying of debt from the show!

Times tough? Can't donate? No worries, you can still help out!

If you don't have the means to contribute financially, don't worry! Here are some other ways you can help: 


Make noise! Share this campaign on Facebook, or whatever social media outlet you prefer. Word of mouth is the single best tool for theatre!
Send me a message (mjaredlee@thefactorytheatrepdx.com) if you would like to volunteer and usher.

<p>Harvard dominates the second act as the older Tommy. He delivers songs in impassioned ASL while dancing and working in sync with Will Hayes, who sings the part in a vulnerable tenor.<br/> - The Washington Post</p>
<p>We started Open Circle because there wasn’t a dedicated space in the DC Metro area where artists with disabilities could hone their craft playing roles not always provided to them in the mainstream professional theatre world alongside their peers without disabilities. Although,DC is a great place to audition and get cast for a diverse pool of actors - many casting directors are willing to consider actors' talents and not worry about body type - other performing artists with disabilities to find their path and didn’t have the boldness to go out and audition.  We wanted to show how disability can <i>enhance</i> an aesthetic, a performance, rather than be perceived as an obstacle to it.</p>
<p>Another important goal was for our audiences to be as diverse as the performers on stage, so we make each and every performance accessible to people of ALL abilities – providing ASL interpretation embedded in most performances, captioning, audio description, and wheelchair accessibility for EVERY performance, not just a select few. That's why we've picked the Silver Spring Black Box Theater in downtown Silver Spring, Maryland as our venue. It's a fully accessible space (both onstage and backstage) with easy access to Metro.</p>
<p>Our comeback show <i>was </i><strong><i>The Who’s Tommy</i></strong> and was directed by our Artistic Director Suzanne Richard (2005 nominated, <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i>) with Jake Null (2016 Helen Hayes Award Winner, <i>Avenue Q</i>,) as the musical director, Cassie Meador (Executive Artistic Director) and Matthew Crumbie (Associate Artistic Director) from Dance Exchange as choreographers along with Jen Bevan adding theatrical staging and choreography.  We wanted to do something challenging with a show that has some important issues. Tommy and the “deaf, dumb, and blind boy” is really a metaphor for the things that Pete Townshend was going through in his childhood, his recovery from his childhood, and his dealing with being a rock star. But we wanted to reclaim the metaphor and look at this through the lens of the real disability experience – we liked to call it - THE METAPHOR STRIKES BACK!</p>
<p>What would it be like if Tommy really were Deaf…Tommy really were blind.  Well, in our production, Tommy is really going to be Deaf and when he turns around to speak for the first time he’s going to speak in American Sign Language not English! And he’s Deaf the whole rest of the time because what is “being healed”?  You know, he’s fine.  He can speak now, that’s what’s important.  He can be ""heard"" and understood.</p>
<p>One third of our cast was professional actors with disabilities. We don’t like to cut corners. We had an cast amazing of actors that can SING the show and can SIGN the show -- all creating one ensemble. For example, we were very excited to have Equity actor Russell Harvard, Broadway, film, and TV star who is Deaf, on board as older Tommy.  Everyone working onstage and backstage is paid as are all the creative designers who do amazing things to bring my vision to life.</p>
<p>So we need YOU to join us to help fund more productions! As Tommy says, “From you, we get the glory!”</p>

<p>The success of this show will have a meaningful impact on all the artists in the company, especially the artists with disabilities who don’t always have prime opportunities to perform.</p>
<p><strong>Testimonial from Monica Lijewski, Equity actor and member of the ensemble of <i>The Who’s Tommy</i>:</strong></p>
<p>I was a professional actor since the time I turned 19 years old.  I’m now 53.  I was injured five years ago in a work accident as an actor and now live with a spinal cord injury. Since then, I have not worked as an actor nor did I ever think I would again.  A chance conversation with a fellow actor friend put me in touch with a woman named Susie Richard. And coincidentally it turns out that Open Circle was reopening its doors after a five year hiatus and was hoping to produce an ambitious show called <i>The Who’s Tommy</i>. When Susie found out I had been an accountant for 11 years as my day job, she actually put me in charge of the company’s finances. And then she encouraged me to audition for the show and I was cast!  I can’t tell you what that means for someone who hasn’t been on the stage for five years…whose life was turned upside down and who suddenly walked into an audition room and felt like a whole, normal person again. We are professionals and we stand or we sit alongside our peer professionals and produce great theater. I couldn’t have hoped to come across anything better at this time of my life.</p>
<p>Open Circle Theatre produces extraordinary works of professional theater.  Theater, unfortunately, is not an inexpensive endeavor. To do it, we can’t rely on ticket sales and we can’t rely on grants.  We have to apply to you, the theatergoers, who enjoy our work. We don’t like having to ask for money but it’s what we must do to do what we must--which is produce great art. A donation, no matter how small, will help us produce <i>The Who’s Tommy</i> and other works of theater with professional artists like me for years to come. THANK YOU!</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
<p>Look around. The fabric of humanity is comprised of individuals of many shapes, sizes, and colors. Yet most of what we see on television, in film, and on the stage does not reflect what our society looks like. People with disabilities, specifically, can be perceived as being “less than” or, in the theater, “not as talented or capable” as their peers. Open Circle Theatre’s mission is to change that perception and stereotype by demonstrating that disability on stage can make a production MORE intriguing, MORE innovative, and MORE beautiful by combining the talents of all of humanity.</p>
<p>Open Circle Theatre needs your help and support to change that perception in our community and in our world.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you can’t afford to contribute right now, please help us get the word out by telling your friends and family about this campaign and the show, LIKING Open Circle Theatre on Facebook (or better yet LOVING us!) and sharing our Facebook links.  You can even choose Open Circle as a charity you can contribute to when you are shopping for qualifying products on Amazon through their AmazonSmile program that you can learn about at: <a href=""http://opencircletheatre.org/donate/amazon-smile/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://opencircletheatre.org/donate/amazon-smile/</a>.

Our comeback show was The Who’s Tommy and was directed by our Artistic Director Suzanne Richard (2005 nominated, Jesus Christ Superstar) with Jake Null (2016 Helen Hayes Award Winner, Avenue Q,) as the musical director, Cassie Meador (Executive Artistic Director) and Matthew Crumbie (Associate Artistic Director) from Dance Exchange as choreographers along with Jen Bevan adding theatrical staging and choreography.  We wanted to do something challenging with a show that has some important issues. Tommy and the “deaf, dumb, and blind boy” is really a metaphor for the things that Pete Townshend was going through in his childhood, his recovery from his childhood, and his dealing with being a rock star. But we wanted to reclaim the metaphor and look at this through the lens of the real disability experience – we liked to call it - THE METAPHOR STRIKES BACK!
What would it be like if Tommy really were Deaf…Tommy really were blind.  Well, in our production, Tommy is really going to be Deaf and when he turns around to speak for the first time he’s going to speak in American Sign Language not English! And he’s Deaf the whole rest of the time because what is “being healed”?  You know, he’s fine.  He can speak now, that’s what’s important.  He can be ""heard"" and understood.
One third of our cast was professional actors with disabilities. We don’t like to cut corners. We had an cast amazing of actors that can SING the show and can SIGN the show -- all creating one ensemble. For example, we were very excited to have Equity actor Russell Harvard, Broadway, film, and TV star who is Deaf, on board as older Tommy.  Everyone working onstage and backstage is paid as are all the creative designers who do amazing things to bring my vision to life.
So we need YOU to join us to help fund more productions! As Tommy says, “From you, we get the glory!”
BREAKING NEWS:  An anonymous donor has magnanimously offered to make a 1:2 dollar match (50 cents on the dollar) if we make our goal!!
We believe we can do it with your donation. No amount is too small so whatever you can give will be appreciated!
Your fully tax-deductible donation will go to support the following production expenses in our upcoming shows:

Actor contracts
Rehearsal ASL interpreters
Directors and Designers
Set, Costumes, Props, and Video
Musicians
Tech Crew
Theatre Rental
…and much more!

A detailed list of what you can get for donations of $50 or more are detailed on our Individual Donation page at http://opencircletheatre.org/donate/individuals/
The success of this show will have a meaningful impact on all the artists in the company, especially the artists with disabilities who don’t always have prime opportunities to perform.
Testimonial from Monica Lijewski, Equity actor and member of the ensemble of The Who’s Tommy:
I was a professional actor since the time I turned 19 years old.  I’m now 53.  I was injured five years ago in a work accident as an actor and now live with a spinal cord injury. Since then, I have not worked as an actor nor did I ever think I would again.  A chance conversation with a fellow actor friend put me in touch with a woman named Susie Richard. And coincidentally it turns out that Open Circle was reopening its doors after a five year hiatus and was hoping to produce an ambitious show called The Who’s Tommy. When Susie found out I had been an accountant for 11 years as my day job, she actually put me in charge of the company’s finances. And then she encouraged me to audition for the show and I was cast!  I can’t tell you what that means for someone who hasn’t been on the stage for five years…whose life was turned upside down and who suddenly walked into an audition room and felt like a whole, normal person again. We are professionals and we stand or we sit alongside our peer professionals and produce great theater. I couldn’t have hoped to come across anything better at this time of my life.
Open Circle Theatre produces extraordinary works of professional theater.  Theater, unfortunately, is not an inexpensive endeavor. To do it, we can’t rely on ticket sales and we can’t rely on grants.  We have to apply to you, the theatergoers, who enjoy our work. We don’t like having to ask for money but it’s what we must do to do what we must--which is produce great art. A donation, no matter how small, will help us produce The Who’s Tommy and other works of theater with professional artists like me for years to come. THANK YOU!
Our Mission
Look around. The fabric of humanity is comprised of individuals of many shapes, sizes, and colors. Yet most of what we see on television, in film, and on the stage does not reflect what our society looks like. People with disabilities, specifically, can be perceived as being “less than” or, in the theater, “not as talented or capable” as their peers. Open Circle Theatre’s mission is to change that perception and stereotype by demonstrating that disability on stage can make a production MORE intriguing, MORE innovative, and MORE beautiful by combining the talents of all of humanity.
Open Circle Theatre needs your help and support to change that perception in our community and in our world.

<h3>Who is Joy?</h3>
<p>Over a year ago an idea came to me. First, it was the title ""The Other Side of Joy"". I knew that I had a story I wanted to share with the world. A country girl who grew up in South Carolina that embarked on a journey in the entertainment world. My life has not been all glitz and glam and I found myself really asking the question, ""Who is Joy?"" As much as this is my story I believe parts of my story is everybody story. Joy is everywhere! To experience JOY we must go through pain and there is always the other side of things. I want people to leave my show with an experience. To take one thing whether it be a story I tell, a joke, or a song I sing. You leave feeling full and with a better understanding of who I am. At the end of the day, we are all the same. Dealing with life which includes insecurities, love, loss, and learning how to pick up the pieces. When you leave my show I want others to be able to pick up a piece of their own life based on the experience they just witness by embarking on the other side with me. </p>

<h2>ABOUT <i>LA FIN</i>
</h2>
<p>“It often happened to me as a child that I wanted to kill myself to annoy other people.”</p>
<p>In this original dark comedy theatre production, LA FIN, Sarah Bernhardt  (1844-1923), the ""great"" French actress (who really slept in a coffin every night), realizes she has just one hour of her life left. She must now find the ultimate theatrical death. In order to find it, she begins to dramatically and humorously reenact the details of her stage deaths and her many true-life- attention-seeking-«attempted »-suicides, from her childhood charades to garner her mother’s attention to the longest gaudy detailed dying sequences in performance one could ever imagine. Through all her ""deaths,"" she shows her love of life.<br/><br/>All the while, people visit her ""deathbed."" Her mother, her son, her manager, an anxious lover. Through each depiction of death, she inevitably portrays snippets of her frenetic love affairs, collision with anti-semitism, provocation of audiences and critics, painful domestic truths, humiliation tactics and hunger for the ultimate performance. <br/><br/>As the performance waivers between the surreal and the historical fact, one can find a little window into the essence of the <i>Divine</i> Sarah. The great actress. The great PR agent. The great French Dier. The great freak-type that has ceased to exist in our icons today.</p>

<p>At a time of uniformity in creation and in society we need to meet unique exceptional characters that inspire us to be and act differently. To be truly ourselves. Sarah Bernahrdt was not only an important figure of her time but she also speaks to us today. What it means to be yourself. A freak. A vivid and the beautiful freak. Once the project is performed in NYC it will travel around the world from professional stages to academic ones and eventually performed by a multitude of actresses in different languages. The entire world knew who Sarah Bernhardt was in 1873. Imagine being THAT good of a PR agent with no Twitter, no radio, and no cellphones! We are bringing her back for the 21rst century. The world could use a reminder about this unique being in order to take powerful risks of their own. </p>

<h3>What is <i>Breaking Surface</i>?</h3>
<p>Breaking Surface tells the story of a Man’s search for inspiration, through a curious relationship with his unseen Muse.  He follows her into the pages of his notebook and on a watery adventure, coming face to face with his own limitations.  Told through dance, acrobatics and airy imagery the audience is led into a world where gravity is overthrown and pages leap from a notebook.  As our hero sinks deeper and deeper into this whimsical world, it transforms around him.  The chair that once anchored him pulls him from the ground and the pages of his book flicker and drift away, to be reborn as a fleet of miniature paper boats. The tiny boats merge into a single vessel that sales on to adventure bringing him back to where he began, but changed. </p>
<p>Throughout the tale, the exploration of movement is deeply linked with the idea that man's imagination cannot be physically explained on the ground. It peeks into a playful world of childhood fantasy, where human bodies defy gravitational laws. Water sounds accent instrumental music by Trevor Exter, John Morgan Kimock and John E Oyzon.  Originally presented by AiRealistic at the Theater for the New City in 2013, this production is produced by 5th Wall Studio. </p>

<h3><strong>How It All Started</strong></h3>
<p>This show is born out of a passion for flight and a love of live theater.  Both creators, Gwyneth Larsen and William Mulholland, adore silent theater and the brilliance of a simple theatrical game.  So, they started to play. As they played, they talked about their relationship with inspiration- how sometimes it's so seamless it's just there. It feels almost as if it's channeling to you from another world, and how sometimes no matter how hard you try, you cannot hear the voice of your muse. </p>
<p>This is their story. It starts where two worlds meet; in the tension of a point of contact just before it is made. In the space between lips before they touch, or the inhale before a story begins. The moment just before you step into the unknown. Once you lift your foot, you’re on the journey. Even if you turn to go back, something’s already happened, you are changed. The first step is magic, the surface has been broken and you are immersed.</p>

<h3>""<i>We rise by lifting others.""</i>
</h3>
<p>This production is a roots to bones passion project.  It's born out of our love of flight, but it has become so much more. Each performance will have only 36 seats and will incorporate water, our style of flying, acrobatic dance, puppetry and beautiful performers.</p>
<p>We have an incredible cast, crew and production team that are working night and day to help us bring this show to you, but as you can imagine creating independent theater in NYC is costly! Can you help us reach our fundraising goal of $15,000?</p>
<p><strong>If you choose to give to us, we thank you in advance for believing in theater as an essential part of life and helping bring this vision to life.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gwyneth Larsen (Co-Creator/Director) - </strong>is a director, choreographer, performer and passionate collaborator. She began her career with the internationally acclaimed folk music &amp; dance company The Vanaver Caravan &amp; went on to work with De La Guarda, Fuerza Bruta, Cirque Du Soleil Special Events, Bregenz Opera, The Metropolitan Opera and in the stunt industry for numerous productions including: Law and Order SVU, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Americans, and as Madonna and Megan Fox’s stunt doubles among others. She was also a founding member of AiRealistic and co-founder of <a href=""http://www.5thwallstudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">5th Wall Studio</a>. She graduated from Sarah Lawrence College with a focus in Greek mythology, modern dance and photography. Her parents, mythologists Drs Stephen &amp; Robin Larsen nurtured in her a profound love of story and myth and a deep respect for nature. In <i><strong>Breaking Surface</strong></i>, she is thrilled to be integrating these foundational beliefs with her physical passions and the mystical world of her youth.</p>
<p><strong>William Mulholland (Co-Creator/Director) -</strong> is also the founder of Bridge Acrobatics, &amp; co-founder of AiRealistic and 5th Wall Studio. He has performed at The Metropolitan Opera in multiple productions. Other credits include: De La Guarda, Fuerza Bruta, Cirque Du Soleil, Pilobolus &amp; the Hollywood Stunt industry. He trained as a gymnast at the Olympic Training Center &amp; became a member of the US National Team, an All-American &amp; team captain at the University of Nebraska, where he studied advertising, marketing &amp; dabbled in theater &amp; dance. He has had the honor of working with a broad variety of high-level gymnasts, circus performers &amp; dancers. In helping these artists blend &amp; expand their skill sets he developed a class series to meld a range of diverse physical techniques &amp; give meaning to the ‘tricks’ done in contemporary movement. Over the years, Bill has cultivated storytelling through physical expression in many arenas, culminating with <i><strong>Breaking Surface</strong></i>. This show combines theater / dance-acrobatics &amp; flying to create a new voice; one that blends childhood dreams of superpowers with the ability to define ones own reality through deep imagining.</p>
<p><strong>Trevor Exter (Composer/Musician)</strong> - has been a professional singer and cellist with his own approach to all aspects of composing, songwriting, producing, performing and touring. He has a couple of bands where he gets to make a spectacle of himself, and some producers like to use him as a secret weapon.  He also plays Fender bass. He has released music under his own name and also as part of XVSK with drummer John Kimock.</p>
<p><strong>John Morgan Kimock (Composer/Musician)</strong> - is a sought-after drummer, composer and arranger from Sonoma County, California living in Brooklyn NY.  His musical collaborations have taken him around the world with a wide range of acts, starting at the age of 5 when John began making bizarre appearances with the likes of tuvan throat singers, Todd Rundgren or with his father Steve's outfit Zero. From 2011-2014 John performed/produced in a two-piece band with Trevor Exter called XVSK.  XVSK was largely an experimental folk band with improvisational elements and occasional guests like Bernie Worrell (Talking Heads, P-Funk) Todd Reynolds (Steve Reich, Meredith Monk), and Dana Colley (Morphine).  They released a full-length album in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>John E Oyzon (Composer/Musician) - </strong>has been a student of Tibetan Buddhism since 1999 and was a professional singer and dancer in New York City, both on and off Broadway, for more than a decade. He graduated from the University at Buffalo with a dual degree in dance choreography and stage acting. His movement style is informed by modern dance, physical theater, Tai Chi, West African, modern dance, Capoeira, house and ecstatic dance styles, but he is most moved by sincerity. He is currently residing in Phoenix, Arizona, where he facilitates dance workshops, plays music for yogis and kirtans, and teaches music to children.</p>

Aquí va:</p><p>Una de las iniciativas que desde hace 12 años tiene lugar en medio de las carnestolendas de Barranquilla, y que se centra en las posibilidades expresivas del teatro, es el <strong>Taller Nacional de Comparsa Teatral</strong> del colectivo La Tropa de Melquíades, proyecto que surgió a partir del interés de un grupo de actores y directores escénicos por aprovechar el multitudinario escenario del carnaval para dar rienda suelta a la creatividad.</p><p>Es así como a partir del 2006, cada año, dos semanas antes del inicio del carnaval, empiezan a reunirse en la ciudad músicos, pintores, bailarines, actores y directores escénicos de distintos grupos de teatro de Barranquilla y el Atlántico, y de diversas ciudades del país, así como artistas internacionales especialmente invitados a hacer parte del taller, para construir personajes, armar escenografías y vestuarios, crear dramaturgias y bandas sonoras y lograr, en muy pocos días, la puesta en escena de una comparsa en la que desfila la magia del teatro para sorprender a los espectadores, y devolverles, convertida en poesía, la sutileza de una idea o emoción, o el reflejo de la abrumadora realidad.</p><p>En estos 10 años La tropa de Melquíades ha abordado distintos temas en sus comparsas. En 2006, puso en escena “Crisálidas”, una bandada de mariposas amarillas como canto a la vida; en el 2007, con “Migraciones”, se abordó el tema de las culturas en movimiento; en 2008 y 2009, “Con los ojos del corazón”, la comparsa dio vida a los personajes de El Principito, de Antoine Saint Exupéry. En el 2010, con “Memoria i-lustrada” los artistas plasmaron su visión acerca del Bicentenario de la República y los 10 años del asesinato de Jaime Garzón. En 2011, “El sueño de Abyayala” fue un homenaje a la tierra; en 2012, “Soñar para la tierra” escenificó la fuerza de la naturaleza. En 2013, con motivo de la celebración de los 200 años de Barranquilla, se puso en escena “Vacanquilla, paso de errantes”; en 2014, los artistas trabajaron el tema del desplazamiento con la comparsa “Errantes”. Y en 2015 y 2016 con motivo del fallecimiento del escritor Gabriel García Márquez, la tropa desfiló con la comparsa “Gabo Eterno”, que permitió volver a ver, gracias a la magia del teatro, a los principales personajes de la obra de nuestro Nobel de Literatura, comandados por un Melquíades alucinante y su grupo de alegres gitanos.</p><p>Texto completo: <a href=""http://revistas.elheraldo.co/latitud/la-tropa-de-melquiades-y-el-invento-del-teatro-en-carnaval-136855"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://revistas.elheraldo.co/latitud/la-tropa-d...</a></p><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </span></p><p>Zoila Sotomayor, member of our ""Comparsa"", expressed for the newspaper El Heraldo of  Barranquilla, some details of the historical evolution of the <strong>National Workshop of Theatrical ""Comparsa""</strong>. Here it goes:</p><p>One of the initiatives that has been taking place for 12 years in the midst of Barranquilla's carnival, and that focuses on the expressive possibilities of the theater, is the <strong>National Workshop of Theatrical Comparsa</strong> of ""La Tropa de Melquiades"" collective, a project that emerged from the interest of a group of actors and stage directors to take advantage of the multitudinous carnival stage to unleash creativity.</p><p>This is how, starting in 2006, every year, two weeks before the start of the carnival, musicians, painters, dancers, actors and stage directors from different theater groups from Barranquilla and the departament of Atlántico, and from different cities of the country, as well as international artists specially invited to take part in the workshop, begin to gather in this city to build characters, create sets and costumes, create dramaturgies and soundtracks and achieve, in a few days, the staging of a parade in which the magic  of the theater is use to surprise the spectators, and return them, converted into poetry, the subtlety of an idea or emotion, or the reflection of the overwhelming reality.</p><p>In these 12 years ""La tropa de Melquiades"" has addressed different issues in their comparsas. In 2006, he staged ""Crisálidas"", a flock of yellow butterflies as a song to life; in 2007, with ""Migrations"", the theme of cultures in movement was addressed; In 2008 and 2009, ""With the eyes of the heart"", the comparsa gave life to the characters of The Little Prince, by Antoine Saint Exupéry. In 2010, with ""Memoria i-lustrada"" the artists captured their vision about the Bicentennial of the Republic and the 10 years of the murder of Jaime Garzón. In 2011, ""The Dream of Abyayala"" was a tribute to the earth; in 2012, ""Dream for the Earth"" staged the force of nature. In 2013, on the occasion of the celebration of the 200th anniversary of Barranquilla, ""Vacanquilla, paso de errantes"" was staged; in 2014, the artists worked on the subject of the displacement with the comparsa ""Errantes"".

Aquí va:Una de las iniciativas que desde hace 12 años tiene lugar en medio de las carnestolendas de Barranquilla, y que se centra en las posibilidades expresivas del teatro, es el Taller Nacional de Comparsa Teatral del colectivo La Tropa de Melquíades, proyecto que surgió a partir del interés de un grupo de actores y directores escénicos por aprovechar el multitudinario escenario del carnaval para dar rienda suelta a la creatividad.Es así como a partir del 2006, cada año, dos semanas antes del inicio del carnaval, empiezan a reunirse en la ciudad músicos, pintores, bailarines, actores y directores escénicos de distintos grupos de teatro de Barranquilla y el Atlántico, y de diversas ciudades del país, así como artistas internacionales especialmente invitados a hacer parte del taller, para construir personajes, armar escenografías y vestuarios, crear dramaturgias y bandas sonoras y lograr, en muy pocos días, la puesta en escena de una comparsa en la que desfila la magia del teatro para sorprender a los espectadores, y devolverles, convertida en poesía, la sutileza de una idea o emoción, o el reflejo de la abrumadora realidad.En estos 10 años La tropa de Melquíades ha abordado distintos temas en sus comparsas. En 2006, puso en escena “Crisálidas”, una bandada de mariposas amarillas como canto a la vida; en el 2007, con “Migraciones”, se abordó el tema de las culturas en movimiento; en 2008 y 2009, “Con los ojos del corazón”, la comparsa dio vida a los personajes de El Principito, de Antoine Saint Exupéry. En el 2010, con “Memoria i-lustrada” los artistas plasmaron su visión acerca del Bicentenario de la República y los 10 años del asesinato de Jaime Garzón. En 2011, “El sueño de Abyayala” fue un homenaje a la tierra; en 2012, “Soñar para la tierra” escenificó la fuerza de la naturaleza. En 2013, con motivo de la celebración de los 200 años de Barranquilla, se puso en escena “Vacanquilla, paso de errantes”; en 2014, los artistas trabajaron el tema del desplazamiento con la comparsa “Errantes”. Y en 2015 y 2016 con motivo del fallecimiento del escritor Gabriel García Márquez, la tropa desfiló con la comparsa “Gabo Eterno”, que permitió volver a ver, gracias a la magia del teatro, a los principales personajes de la obra de nuestro Nobel de Literatura, comandados por un Melquíades alucinante y su grupo de alegres gitanos.Texto completo: http://revistas.elheraldo.co/latitud/la-tropa-d...-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Zoila Sotomayor, member of our ""Comparsa"", expressed for the newspaper El Heraldo of  Barranquilla, some details of the historical evolution of the National Workshop of Theatrical ""Comparsa"". Here it goes:One of the initiatives that has been taking place for 12 years in the midst of Barranquilla's carnival, and that focuses on the expressive possibilities of the theater, is the National Workshop of Theatrical Comparsa of ""La Tropa de Melquiades"" collective, a project that emerged from the interest of a group of actors and stage directors to take advantage of the multitudinous carnival stage to unleash creativity.This is how, starting in 2006, every year, two weeks before the start of the carnival, musicians, painters, dancers, actors and stage directors from different theater groups from Barranquilla and the departament of Atlántico, and from different cities of the country, as well as international artists specially invited to take part in the workshop, begin to gather in this city to build characters, create sets and costumes, create dramaturgies and soundtracks and achieve, in a few days, the staging of a parade in which the magic  of the theater is use to surprise the spectators, and return them, converted into poetry, the subtlety of an idea or emotion, or the reflection of the overwhelming reality.In these 12 years ""La tropa de Melquiades"" has addressed different issues in their comparsas. In 2006, he staged ""Crisálidas"", a flock of yellow butterflies as a song to life; in 2007, with ""Migrations"", the theme of cultures in movement was addressed; In 2008 and 2009, ""With the eyes of the heart"", the comparsa gave life to the characters of The Little Prince, by Antoine Saint Exupéry. In 2010, with ""Memoria i-lustrada"" the artists captured their vision about the Bicentennial of the Republic and the 10 years of the murder of Jaime Garzón. In 2011, ""The Dream of Abyayala"" was a tribute to the earth; in 2012, ""Dream for the Earth"" staged the force of nature. In 2013, on the occasion of the celebration of the 200th anniversary of Barranquilla, ""Vacanquilla, paso de errantes"" was staged; in 2014, the artists worked on the subject of the displacement with the comparsa ""Errantes"". And in 2015 and 2016, on the occasion of the death of the writer Gabriel García Márquez, the troop paraded with the comparsa ""Gabo Eterno"", a tribute that will allowed to see again, thanks to the magic of the theater, the main characters of the work of our Literature Nobel, commanded by an amazing Melquiades and his group of cheerful gypsies.Full text: http://revistas.elheraldo.co/latitud/la-tropa-d...La comparsa teatral.

<p><strong>Who is Cygnet Theatre?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cygnet Theatre is a new English-speaking Shakespeare troupe</strong> in Paris, founded by actors &amp; friends from all over the world. Long story short: We came to Paris. We fell in love (some with the city, some with the locals). Cliché, right? Perhaps so, but we're here because this city has captured us (heart, soul, and wallet), and we couldn't let go of the dream of performing classical works in their native language. So here we are. </p>
<p>Our team is currently made up of :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Emily Guernsey</strong>, Cygnet's secretary. American. BFA in Acting from Elon University, NC. Length of time in France: Nearly five years. Favorite Shakespearean play: <i>The Tempest.</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Audrey Mikondo</strong>, Director of communications. French. Studied with Cours Florent, and performed with <i>Bouffes du Nord. </i> Length of time in France: whole life. Favorite Shakespearean play: <i>Love's Labours Lost</i>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Charlotte Pleasants</strong>, the Treasurer. New Zealander. BA in theatre studies from Victoria University Wellington. Length of time in France: about four years. Favorite Shakespearean play:  <i>The Winter's Tale.</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Taylor Scott</strong>, Cygnet's President. Canadian. BFA in Acting from the University of British Columbia. Length of time in France: two years. Favorite Shakespearean play: <i>Antony and Cleopatra.</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Joshua Stretton</strong>, France-England liaison. British. Degree in theatre from Goldsmiths in London. Length of time in France: off and on over the last five years. Favorite Shakespearean play: <i>Henry IV part 1.</i> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>One thing has become clear to the five of us</strong>: Paris doesn't yet host the type of English companies we are seeking to be. We love the vibrant scene of scratch nights, poetry slams, theatre festivals, and solo productions. While these events are crucial to fulfilling our lives as inventive expats, they cannot sustain artists or set them on a viable career path. We are setting out to change all that. So, after months of late meetings, intercontinental skype sessions, and prefecture visits, we are declared as an association in France, and ready to move forward with the <i>creative</i> side of things.</p>
<p><strong>Cygnet Theatre is meaningful to us</strong> because we've studied extensively for careers in performance. Once we established ourselves here in Paris it became critical for us to focus on building opportunities for professional creative expression.</p>
<p><strong>Cygnet Theatre is meaningful to <i>you</i> </strong>as a community member because as a company we will be working to produce not only classics, but eventually new works from <strong>unheard voices</strong>. We will be engaging not only with audiences, but with <strong>students</strong>, through various workshops. We will be entertaining with a vision of <strong>accessibility</strong> — anyone who wants to see our shows or apply to work with us will have the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How is Cygnet Theatre different?</strong></h3>
<p>Cygnet Theatre is sincerely committed to the advancement of artists and production personnel by way of exploration, interpretation, development, and production of Shakespeare’s works. Apprenticeships and assistantships with Cygnet Theatre are designed to foster an understanding of the production process, and to nurture interest and involvement in anglophone theatre. In addition to this, <strong>all artists who work with Cygnet theatre are paid</strong>. As artists, we know all too well that a pizza for a day's work might help curb the hunger for a day or two, but doesn't satisfy the thirst for sincere respect and compensation for the work one has been trained to do. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Shakespeare?</h3>
<p>In short, Shakespeare’s works are universal. They are the story of the Everyman, the everyone. They are stories of love, of loss, of jealousy, of shame, of hubris… they are relatable. They are malleable. They can be told time and time again, and the characters’ journeys can be different every time. Shakespeare coined many words and phrases in the English language that we us on the daily, he is an intrinsic part of both theatrical and English history. This is why we<strong> keep telling his stories</strong>, and this is why we want the Bard to have a home in Paris.</p>

<p>Your contribution to Cygnet Theatre will help us build a company that<strong> encourages respect and compensation</strong> of local theatre artists. It will also help in the creation of a professional international and classical theatre scene in Paris. Take a peek at our perks listed on the side bar. We appreciate every penny, and will be sure to show you our gratitude, be it with words, tickets, or names in programs. </p>
<p>Our overall costs for the season total <strong>20,000 euros. </strong>From you, we are asking for <strong>2,500 euros.</strong> This will cover the production costs of <i>Twelfth Night</i>, our first show of the season. We are furiously hosting fundraisers and applying for grants in order to make up the difference, and we’re not slowing down anytime soon.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why contribute?</strong></h3>
<p>When you make a contribution to Cygnet Theatre, you are making a contribution to the artistic community in Paris as a whole. The goal of Cygnet is not simply to produce professional classical performances, but to grow into an example of what a theatre company can be here, and into <strong>an educational tool for the city</strong>. As Cygnet grows, we aim to develop tools to help foster and nurture the scene of classical theatre in Paris. Here are some of our plans:</p>
<p>As the troupe grows, we will:</p>
<p><i>1. Support new work from local and international playwrights</i></p>
<p>We believe that classical theatre is critical to the growth and development of future artists and playwrights. By supporting new work through a classical lens, we strive to acknowledge how one must learn from the past in order to create work that is pertinent to the now, and we plan on supporting these fresh, new stories in addition to producing timeless ones: <strong>because every voice deserves to be heard</strong>.</p>
<p><i>2. Offer workshops to local artists</i></p>
<p>Cygnet Theatre already hosts a number of actors trained in very different methods. As Cygnet grows, we will not only offer master classes taught by our company members, but we will bring in educators from all over the world to help <strong>strengthen the English performance industry</strong> here in Paris. Not only will this enhance the performance scene here, but it will begin to demonstrate to the world that Paris truly is a place where you can find exceptional French theatre right alongside exceptional English theatre. It will encourage artists across the world to commute here for theatrical projects and personal growth.</p>
<p><i>3. Educate students in classical and Shakespearean works</i></p>
<p>You know why we think classical theatre is important, but may be wondering: why should local schools and students care about it? For non-English speakers, Shakespeare is a great way to play with the English language, and to show how old language doesn’t need to invoke fear or dismay: to demonstrate how the English language has evolved and how Shakespeare even coined quite a few words! In addition to this, we plan on visiting drama classes and teaching them those little secrets that make Shakespeare more accessible, and more fun, for both native and non-native speakers. The goal is to inspire confidence in the English language, both on the tip of the tongue and on the stage. We are well-equipped to do this, as three of our founders have taught both theatre and English for years. By working with children and adults alike, our goal is to truly foster a <strong>new sense of</strong> <strong>community </strong>in the the English speaking world of theatre in Paris.</p>
<p><i>4. Super title our shows</i></p>
<p>Accessibility is incredible important to us here at Cygnet Theatre. You’ll notice our Indiegogo video has closed captions in French, and as soon as we are financially secure enough to do so, our performances will also be equipped with super titles in French for those that speak limited in English, alternating with English super titles for the hearing impaired. These are goals we hope to implement within year or two of opening the company. We realize this is ambitious, and that is why we are asking for your help to truly put forward <strong>theatre that is accessible to all.</strong></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any creative venture, starting a theatre company is risky. The challenge is even greater when the performance language is not the national language – but we’ve been working towards these moments since we toddled on stage in our first kid’s theatre class. Every unpaid gig, every theatre history essay, every late-night script analysis session, and every failure have prepared us to tackle the inevitable hard times. We’re always learning. That doesn’t scare us. What scares us is looking back and <strong>wishing we had dreamed bigger.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways to Help</h3>
<p>For a  fundraising campaign like ours, every dollar, euro, pound, penny, centime — every bit helps. However, as artists we of course understand that a financial donation is not always feasible (even if you're enthusiastic and supportive of the cause!)</p>
<p>If your wallet is a little light this month, <strong>there are other ways you can help us</strong>! The first big one is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Share this link! Share this page with anyone and everyone you think may be interested in Cygnet Theatre.</li>
<li>Volunteer your time. We are always looking for volunteers as ushers or house managers for our shows, help transporting props, etc. There's a near constant need for volunteers at showtime! Shoot us an email at info@cygnettheatreparis.com to let us know you're interested!</li>
<li>Volunteer your services! If you have a certain skill set you think could be of use to a budding theatre company (from consulting to accounting to anything creative), we'd welcome any and all help and advice. </li>
<li>Come to see the shows!</li>
</ol>
<p>We'll leave it at that. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us though our email (info@cygnettheatreparis.com) or through our website (cygnettheatreparis.com). And, most important, from the bottom our hearts we offer a sincere</p>

</div></div>","Who is Cygnet Theatre?
Cygnet Theatre is a new English-speaking Shakespeare troupe in Paris, founded by actors & friends from all over the world. Long story short: We came to Paris. We fell in love (some with the city, some with the locals). Cliché, right? Perhaps so, but we're here because this city has captured us (heart, soul, and wallet), and we couldn't let go of the dream of performing classical works in their native language. So here we are. 
Our team is currently made up of :


Emily Guernsey, Cygnet's secretary. American. BFA in Acting from Elon University, NC. Length of time in France: Nearly five years. Favorite Shakespearean play: The Tempest.


Audrey Mikondo, Director of communications. French. Studied with Cours Florent, and performed with Bouffes du Nord.  Length of time in France: whole life. Favorite Shakespearean play: Love's Labours Lost.

Charlotte Pleasants, the Treasurer. New Zealander. BA in theatre studies from Victoria University Wellington. Length of time in France: about four years. Favorite Shakespearean play:  The Winter's Tale.


Taylor Scott, Cygnet's President. Canadian. BFA in Acting from the University of British Columbia. Length of time in France: two years. Favorite Shakespearean play: Antony and Cleopatra.


Joshua Stretton, France-England liaison. British. Degree in theatre from Goldsmiths in London. Length of time in France: off and on over the last five years. Favorite Shakespearean play: Henry IV part 1. 

One thing has become clear to the five of us: Paris doesn't yet host the type of English companies we are seeking to be. We love the vibrant scene of scratch nights, poetry slams, theatre festivals, and solo productions. While these events are crucial to fulfilling our lives as inventive expats, they cannot sustain artists or set them on a viable career path. We are setting out to change all that. So, after months of late meetings, intercontinental skype sessions, and prefecture visits, we are declared as an association in France, and ready to move forward with the creative side of things.
Cygnet Theatre is meaningful to us because we've studied extensively for careers in performance. Once we established ourselves here in Paris it became critical for us to focus on building opportunities for professional creative expression.
Cygnet Theatre is meaningful to you as a community member because as a company we will be working to produce not only classics, but eventually new works from unheard voices. We will be engaging not only with audiences, but with students, through various workshops. We will be entertaining with a vision of accessibility — anyone who wants to see our shows or apply to work with us will have the opportunity to do so.
 
Do these things mean something to you? Then read on for more detail into who we are and what we do — or head over directly to our perks and figure out which donation is right for you!
 

 
How is Cygnet Theatre different?
Cygnet Theatre is sincerely committed to the advancement of artists and production personnel by way of exploration, interpretation, development, and production of Shakespeare’s works. Apprenticeships and assistantships with Cygnet Theatre are designed to foster an understanding of the production process, and to nurture interest and involvement in anglophone theatre. In addition to this, all artists who work with Cygnet theatre are paid. As artists, we know all too well that a pizza for a day's work might help curb the hunger for a day or two, but doesn't satisfy the thirst for sincere respect and compensation for the work one has been trained to do. 
 
Why Shakespeare?
In short, Shakespeare’s works are universal. They are the story of the Everyman, the everyone. They are stories of love, of loss, of jealousy, of shame, of hubris… they are relatable. They are malleable. They can be told time and time again, and the characters’ journeys can be different every time. Shakespeare coined many words and phrases in the English language that we us on the daily, he is an intrinsic part of both theatrical and English history. This is why we keep telling his stories, and this is why we want the Bard to have a home in Paris.

 
Where does your Donation go?
Your contribution to Cygnet Theatre will help us build a company that encourages respect and compensation of local theatre artists. It will also help in the creation of a professional international and classical theatre scene in Paris. Take a peek at our perks listed on the side bar.

Our starting goal is $2000 to cover business start up fees, website development, and most importantly, our artists. We’ve recruited the best talent we know to write, direct, and act in our first 24-hour play festival.
Your contribution supports not only our coffee fund for six writers, six directors, and eighteen actors, but it contributes to the technology necessary to create our festival. Your kind donations will serve as Organic Theatre’s financial foundation, from which we can genuinely build opportunities.  
 
What Your Contribution Means to Us:
By believing in us, you are believing in a new kind of theatre. You are becoming part of a movement bigger than yourself…",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We went on with rehearsal. There was work to be done.</p><p>Afterwards, several actors stayed behind. They vented their frustrations and anger. I talked about how I remembered where I was and what I was doing when I heard about Columbine... and how nothing had changed. They shared their memories of Sandy Hook; although they were quite young at the time, they remembered. We talked, cried and went home.</p><p>I thought that was the end of it. The next day while randomly thumbing through a stack of scripts I had ordered years ago, columbinus caught my eye. As I read the riveting script, the Social Justice Theater of the Carolinas was born and columbinus was chosen as our inaugural play.</p><p>SJTC is currently comprised of alumni of our Pittsboro Youth Theater which also calls Sweet Bee Theater “home.” Discussions after Parkland made clear that these young people were interested in applying their theatrical skills for more than entertainment.</p><p>SJTC will be performing columbinus live on stage 3 times April 19-20, 2019 which is the 20th Anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings.</p><p>Columbinus is a play by the United States Theatre Project Written by Stephen Karam and PJ Paparelli.

This play is important because it deftly unites rather than divides. Instead of focusing on hot-button topics like gun control, columbinus focuses on questions such as those the author, P.J. Paparelli, included in the forward:</p><p>""How do we treat each other?  Why do we treat each other the way we do?  Why do kids, who will soon ask these questions about their kids, continue to treat each other the same way?  Why does this cycle never change, even after the kids themselves resort to bombs and guns and butchering their fellow students to prove a point?  Why do we look for an easy answer- a pill to take, a program to turn off- when we know in our hearts that something deep inside us has to change?  What are we afraid of?""  </p><p>These types of questions create dialogue and bring communities closer rather than divide them. After each show, a counselor will lead a community discussion between the actors and the audience about school shootings.</p><p>In addition, there will be daily information, inspiration, pictures and videos on our Facebook page that chronicles our rehearsal and performance process. You will be able to watch as the actors grow into their characters and grapple with this very difficult topic.

This will enhance the discussion by adding to those ""at the table"".</p><p>The Project</p><p>The funds requested for this project will be used for our inaugural production, columbinus. The play will be produced whether or not all funds are raised. It is our hope that, with these funds, the play can be offered to the community for free in order to start a community discussion and include those that otherwise could not afford to attend. The first $2,500 will be used for royalties, scripts, costumes, lighting, theater rental, advertising etc. The rest of the funds raised will be used to take the play to other locations such as community centers, churches, schools etc. throughout North and South Carolina. Those funds will pay for gas, hotel rooms (if needed), royalties, technical staff, rental of sound and lighting equipment etc.</p><p>The Impact</p><p>This project will make a difference in the lives of the actors, the audience and the community! Communication is the key to avoid these and many other social problems. This play will spark discussions beyond the walls of the theater. We will ask each person that attends the play as well as our online followers to discuss these questions with 10 other people which we hope will create a ripple effect beyond the community and even the state!</p><p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p><p>We face 2 major challenges. First, this play is difficult. It is most often performed in Universities. However, I think it is most powerful when done by teenagers because they are the ones that are most affected my school shootings. We have a talented and experienced group of actors committed to the show. However, rehearsals will be difficult for some. To help with this, we will bring in a councilor to assist with rehearsals.</p><p>The second challenge that we face is community buy in. This play, although beautifully written and very respectful to those who died at Columbine, is controversial.

<ul>
<li>the fierce bond between mother and daughter</li>
<li>identity and what this looks like when we face crisis</li>
<li>the invasion of home  and all the things we cultivate to survive</li>
<li>the separation of family when dysfunction is insurmountable </li>
<li>identity, poverty, play, fantasy, and violence</li>

Inspired by the characters found in Roxane Gay's collection of short stories ""Difficult Women"" we explore female struggle, resilience and identity. We work-shopped a successful shorter version of this production last winter and dove back in this year, revamping and expanding for a full length, 60min production being held at The Tank Theater NYC this December. We need your help to build a provocative, thoughtful show to inspire all audiences!</p><p align=""center""><strong><u>About Our Company KGDDance</u></strong></p><p>As a modern/contemporary dance company KGDDance provides a platform for truthful female-centric artistic narratives, told through movement and dance. As either a new work or movement adaptation, these stories deal with the complex strengths and vulnerabilities of women, and the truthful relationships they share with others as well as themselves. We are dedicated to exploring movement and collaborating with other artists to create a space in which these beautifully flawed characters can flourish and breathe.</p><p>For more info on us and our past projects visit <a href=""http://www.kgddance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kgddance.com</a> !</p><p align=""center""><strong><u>About the ""Difficult Women"" Project</u></strong></p><p>This project explores the female complexities within three of Roxane Gay’s stories: “I Will Follow You” (danced by Madeline Charles and Taylor Marie), “I am the Knife” (danced by Brittany Posas and Song Ravinan) and “Break all the way Down” (danced by Gabriela Vazquez).</p><p>Within each story line we explore female identity through the impossible situations and circumstances these characters have had to deal with. The key that links these stories together is one girl (dancer Bonnie Bushnell) who tries to understand her own identity while gaining inspiration from the women within these stories.</p><p>This performance will also feature the work of lighting designer Kent Sprague and original music by Trevor Danko.</p><p>We believe that woman have this amazing capacity to find immense strength through struggle and trauma. We want to inspire others, specifically women to enjoy what makes them vulnerable or “unlikable” or ""difficult"", it’s part of who they are. In light of recent feminist movements (the various women's marches, #metoo, #timeisup, etc), this show promotes the message that a woman of any class, race or religion never has to apologize for who she is or what she has been through.</p><p align=""center""> </p><p align=""center""> </p><p align=""center""><strong><u>The Team</u></strong></p><p>Choreographer and Director: <strong><i>Katya Danko</i></strong></p><p>Lighting Designer: <strong><i>Kent Sprague</i></strong></p><p>Original Music: <strong><i>Trevor Danko</i></strong></p><p>Performers:</p><p><strong><i>Bonnie Bushnell</i></strong></p><p><strong><i>Madeline Charles</i></strong></p><p><strong><i>Taylor Marie </i></strong></p><p><strong><i>Brittany Posas</i></strong></p><p><strong><i>Song Ravinan</i></strong></p><p><strong><i>Gabriela Vazquez </i></strong></p><p>For more info on our team visit <a href=""http://www.kgddance.com/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kgddance.com/about</a></p><p align=""center""><strong><u>Impact</u></strong></p><p>Your Support will go to:</p><p>-Compensation for Performers and Designers</p><p>-Budget for Costume and Props</p><p>-Rehearsal Studio Rental</p><p>-Marketing Materials</p><p>-Extra Emergency Funds</p><p>We accept donations of any and all sizes.

Inspired by the characters found in Roxane Gay's collection of short stories ""Difficult Women"" we explore female struggle, resilience and identity. We work-shopped a successful shorter version of this production last winter and dove back in this year, revamping and expanding for a full length, 60min production being held at The Tank Theater NYC this December. We need your help to build a provocative, thoughtful show to inspire all audiences!About Our Company KGDDanceAs a modern/contemporary dance company KGDDance provides a platform for truthful female-centric artistic narratives, told through movement and dance. As either a new work or movement adaptation, these stories deal with the complex strengths and vulnerabilities of women, and the truthful relationships they share with others as well as themselves. We are dedicated to exploring movement and collaborating with other artists to create a space in which these beautifully flawed characters can flourish and breathe.For more info on us and our past projects visit www.kgddance.com !About the ""Difficult Women"" ProjectThis project explores the female complexities within three of Roxane Gay’s stories: “I Will Follow You” (danced by Madeline Charles and Taylor Marie), “I am the Knife” (danced by Brittany Posas and Song Ravinan) and “Break all the way Down” (danced by Gabriela Vazquez).Within each story line we explore female identity through the impossible situations and circumstances these characters have had to deal with. The key that links these stories together is one girl (dancer Bonnie Bushnell) who tries to understand her own identity while gaining inspiration from the women within these stories.This performance will also feature the work of lighting designer Kent Sprague and original music by Trevor Danko.We believe that woman have this amazing capacity to find immense strength through struggle and trauma. We want to inspire others, specifically women to enjoy what makes them vulnerable or “unlikable” or ""difficult"", it’s part of who they are. In light of recent feminist movements (the various women's marches, #metoo, #timeisup, etc), this show promotes the message that a woman of any class, race or religion never has to apologize for who she is or what she has been through.  The TeamChoreographer and Director: Katya DankoLighting Designer: Kent SpragueOriginal Music: Trevor DankoPerformers:Bonnie BushnellMadeline CharlesTaylor Marie Brittany PosasSong RavinanGabriela Vazquez For more info on our team visit www.kgddance.com/aboutImpactYour Support will go to:-Compensation for Performers and Designers-Budget for Costume and Props-Rehearsal Studio Rental-Marketing Materials-Extra Emergency FundsWe accept donations of any and all sizes.

<h3>What is Takes Chops Productions?</h3>
<p>In the winter of 2019, Student Theatre at Marymount sponsored a small production of Scab to be performed in the school dining hall. The rehearsal process was challenging, cathartic, and beautiful- we couldn't stop after our 3 scheduled performances. So instead of succumbing to the post- show slump, we got the cast and crew back together (with a couple exciting new additions) and decided we would do it again. We formed Takes Chops Productions, acquired the rights to the show, and set about planning for our new and improved production. </p>
<h3>Cast and Crew</h3>
<p>Production Team:</p>
<p>Director - Flynn Osman</p>
<p>Stage Manager/ Sound Designer - Tessa Welsch</p>
<p>Assistant Stage Manager/ Props Master - Claire Shutters</p>
<p>Lighting/Sound Design - Angelo Sagnelli</p>
<p>Costume Design - Ethan Wong</p>
<p>Assistant Costume Designer/ Hair and Makeup Designer - Abigayle Luttrell</p>
<p>Movement Coach/Choreographer - Samuel Hohn</p>
<p>Producer- Caroline McQuaig</p>
<p>Cast</p>
<p>Anima - Hailey Burger</p>
<p>Christa - Caroline McQuaig</p>

<p>Jenna/Angel One - Jackie Kraft</p>
<p>Mom/Kellee/Mary-Androgyne - Haley Glickman</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Budget Breakdown </h3>
<p>If you choose to give to our campaign, your money will be going towards:</p>
<p>- Venue Rental- We will be performing at The Gallery Space in the Access Theater in SoHo.</p>
<p>- Costumes designed by Ethan Wong </p>
<p>-Props sourced and designed by Claire Shutters</p>
<p>-Lighting Equipment for designer Angelo Sagnelli to bring his vision to life</p>
<p>-Sets so our new recruit Peyton Tavares can build our world</p>
<p>-Marketing, so as many people as possible can come experience this play we love so much</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Creating theatre is always a financial risk, but we believe it is a worthwhile one. Theater space, especially in New York City, comes at a price and we cannot cover it alone. We also have big dreams here at TCP and some of the gorgeous costume and set designs we have in mind for this new production are going to require more than what we can source from our own homes. With your funding and our ingenuity and elbow grease, we can make this DIY production look like a Broadway smash. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are many ways to help us get this project off the ground without a financial contribution! You can support us by sharing this campaign with your friends and on social media and following us on Instagram (@takeschops). </p>

<p>In Japan, after the 15th century, the teachings of the ""Three Obediences"" reigned: </p>
<p>""A woman has no way of independence in life: when she is young, she obeys her father; when she is married, she obeys her husband; when she is widowed, she obeys her son.""</p>
<p>Even though this play is the story of  one woman, it is the story of multitudinous women throughout the ages, throughout all cultures.

<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Of Burning Desire is an operetta with a stunning mix of the traditional and the contemporary.  Drawing from classic Japanese theater forms (Kabuki &amp; Noh) and composer Kento Iwasaki's brilliant fusion of opera and traditional Japanese music, the story unfolds through a dazzling array of dance, song and visuals. </span><br/>

Of Burning Desire explores the complex responses of the feminine psyche amid social protocols and dictated behaviors that result in repression of Self and disconnection from one's own emotional life. 
In Japan, after the 15th century, the teachings of the ""Three Obediences"" reigned: 
""A woman has no way of independence in life: when she is young, she obeys her father; when she is married, she obeys her husband; when she is widowed, she obeys her son.""
Even though this play is the story of  one woman, it is the story of multitudinous women throughout the ages, throughout all cultures. Even though this story takes place in early Edo period Japan, the arrested development of personal autonomy and the impact that has on how women perceive and interact with themselves and the world is still prevalent in 2015. 



Of Burning Desire is an operetta with a stunning mix of the traditional and the contemporary.  Drawing from classic Japanese theater forms (Kabuki & Noh) and composer Kento Iwasaki's brilliant fusion of opera and traditional Japanese music, the story unfolds through a dazzling array of dance, song and visuals.

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there!  We are two creative individuals who have been friends for over seven years.  Four years ago we went to a coffee shop in DC and decided to write a play together.  We bought a notebook with the word 'Gratitude' on the cover and Brian wrote the first line.  We passed the notebook back and forth creating the script line by line.  Since I live in Boston and Brian lives in DC, we would each write a scene and make changes online.  Discovering how to blend our writing styles was a fascinating part of the process.  </p>
<p>A few months after we finished writing the play, we had it workshopped through Artist's Bloc.  Having it read out loud by actors and given input on changes to be made, we rewrote many scenes and felt as if it flowed much better.  It took many submissions to theaters, but we finally got accepted into the Capital Fringe Festival and cannot be happier!</p>
<p>The money you give will make this play happen.  <i>Interconnected</i> conveys some emotional truths and also shows what we can learn from confusion.  Help others reflect on, and be grateful for, their lives.  That's the power of your donation!</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need 7G's or $7,000!  Why do you need that much money, you ask?  GOOD QUESTION!  In producing this play, we are paying actors and production staff as well as marketing and traveling costs.  There are multiple set pieces we need to purchase to furnish a semi-real looking apartment, hospital room, diner and bar which will require a van and storage unit.<br/></p>
<p>There are many perks if you donate a certain amount of money, which you can view on the right column.  Who doesn't like perks?!  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This is the cheesy part:  Both Karen and I have wanted to do this since we were little kids.  So much so that Karen studied acting and directing in college, and I studied film and media.  Our love of the arts runs #deep.  Karen works at the American Repertory Theater and I just came out with a CD of original songs.  Both of us have performed with the education theater troupe Improbable Players.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Even though Karen has a theater background and Brian has film experience, neither has produced a play from top to bottom.  This is a new challenge that we are taking on because we both are hard working, dedicated people who believe in sharing stories with audiences.</p>

Maybe you'd like to donate space, time, your web design abilities, hang a light or two for free... Be creative. We appreciate everything.
Yes, I know my goals are huge, but they are also obtainable with the help of fine people like you.  This year I am looking forward to forging strong connections with other local theatre companies, local businesses and all of you.
Thank you so much for entertaining the dreams of a this young Arts Administrator from the Bullcity. 
Onward and upward in love,

it will be accessible to

performances, which include theatre venue rental, program and promotional
material printing, sets, costumes, and props. This totals to $6,500.


Most of these expenses were going to be covered by (now) two Chicago arts organization. Unfortunately,  two of our sponsors did not receive enough government funding due to cuts to arts nationwide, which leaves us with a much more
difficult funding situation than we had anticipated. We do have a few businesses
offering sponsorship to our project, but we need the support of many more in
order to cover necessary costs.


If you think this project is as wonderful as we do, please
consider contributing to our campaign. Any contribution is greatly appreciated
and is also tax-deductible! You can also check out our cool assortment of
prizes for certain levels of contribution. Gracías!


Who are we? Melissa Segarra – Producer of “El Huésped del Sevillano”.


 This is my second
venture in producing zarzuela. My first production was 2014’s “La Dolorosa” at
Chicago’s Casa Italia and Instituto Cervantes. I studied vocal performance,
dramaturgy, and Spanish at Northwestern University and am highly interested in
the intersection between the arts and social justice. I plan to pursue a
master’s degree in the fall for Arts Management so I can produce art that is
relevant, powerful, and impactful.

<p>Sex worker, <a href=""http://thewhorecast.com/podcast/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">podcaster</a> and <a href=""http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/the-whore-next-door/Category?oid=2825557"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">journalist</a> Siouxsie Q makes her New York City debut bringing her original one act musical to the <a href=""http://bricktheater.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brick Theater</a> this summer!  Siouxsie Q has made quite a splash since launching her Sex Work themed Podcast ""The WhoreCast"" in the Fall of 2012 with the mission to humanize
people in the sex industry by creating a platform for sex workers to share
their art, their stories - their voices. “Through art and storytelling I hope that we
can change hearts and minds and show the world that sex workers are people
too…though sometimes we are also mermaids.” says Q.  Capitalizing on the success of the Whorecast, Siouxsie has become a prolific writer as a regular columnist for the SF weekly and a featured writer for Ratter.com, Eros Media, and the Slixa blog.  </p>
<p><i>Fish-girl</i> is the culmination of 5 years of long
distance collaboration between Miss Q and her best friend, award winning theatre maker Sean Andries out of
Portland, Oregon. A fairy tale exploring themes of sex work through the lens of fantasy, <i>Fish-girl</i> weaves together the tale of a love struck tourist (Sean Andries) who
falls into the deep end when he meets the ""girl"" of his dreams (Siouxsie Q).
 She’s half fish, half girl, half real, half dream, half in this world,
half out--a fish and a bird can fall in love, but where can they build their nest?</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Fish-girl</i> includes original
songs written and performed by Siouxsie Q as well as  shadow play, physical comedy, antique slide
projections and high drama. But perhaps the most exciting aspect of the play is
that it is an insider’s look into the hopes, dreams, and fears of a sex worker
and the one who loves her. </p>

</div></div>","Summary 
Sex worker, podcaster and journalist Siouxsie Q makes her New York City debut bringing her original one act musical to the Brick Theater this summer!  Siouxsie Q has made quite a splash since launching her Sex Work themed Podcast ""The WhoreCast"" in the Fall of 2012 with the mission to humanize
people in the sex industry by creating a platform for sex workers to share
their art, their stories - their voices. “Through art and storytelling I hope that we
can change hearts and minds and show the world that sex workers are people
too…though sometimes we are also mermaids.” says Q.  Capitalizing on the success of the Whorecast, Siouxsie has become a prolific writer as a regular columnist for the SF weekly and a featured writer for Ratter.com, Eros Media, and the Slixa blog.  
Fish-girl is the culmination of 5 years of long
distance collaboration between Miss Q and her best friend, award winning theatre maker Sean Andries out of
Portland, Oregon. A fairy tale exploring themes of sex work through the lens of fantasy, Fish-girl weaves together the tale of a love struck tourist (Sean Andries) who
falls into the deep end when he meets the ""girl"" of his dreams (Siouxsie Q).
 She’s half fish, half girl, half real, half dream, half in this world,
half out--a fish and a bird can fall in love, but where can they build their nest?

Fish-girl includes original
songs written and performed by Siouxsie Q as well as  shadow play, physical comedy, antique slide
projections and high drama. But perhaps the most exciting aspect of the play is
that it is an insider’s look into the hopes, dreams, and fears of a sex worker
and the one who loves her.

What We Need

We need 5500 dollars to get Fish Girl to NYC.  Your money goes to:


Food/Lodging for Siouxsie Q, Sean Andries and our crew of 3 for the 10 days that we will be in New York putting on the show
Airfare from Oakland CA & Portland OR to New York
Set construction - it's cheaper to rebuild than ship
Marketing so we can fill the house 
F!ck Fest application and festival fees 

Indie a go go fees

    The Impact We will not be able to do this show and spread its message without your support.  Not only is this an amazing play but it is an important one.  We truly believe that we can change people's hearts and minds through storytelling and art.  Fish-girl is one of those stories.

Risks & Challenges
 Putting on a show is always a challenge, let alone putting on a show in a city as big as New York.  We are lucky to be a part of a great festival - ""F!ckfest"" - at a great theatre - The Brick Theatre - yet obstacles and challenges still lie ahead.  From finding a wine barrel and building a set in a strange town to getting people to come to the show to feeding our crew, this will be a grand adventure, and we need YOUR HELP to make it happen.
    Other Ways You Can Help We know not everyone can dig deep in their pockets to help us out, but thankfully there are loads of other ways to help us out!

The aim of theatricals is to use the increased confidence through performing on stage to raise the
ceiling of expectation, giving participants the chance to achieve their social,
personal and theatrical potential by performing to their peers and the general
public. </p>
<p>Theatricals is a partnership between Fluid Motion Theatre Company and Mencap Basingstoke. The group started in June 2015 and will meet every week at The Ridgeway Centre in Buckskin. Participants learn a range of different skills and techniques, including mime, clowning, improvisation, prop making and lots more. </p>
<h3><b>Our Vision</b></h3>
<div>Our vision is to create a highly professional performance company over a period of three years, with a view to maintaining the group long after it has been established. We believe that the process of creating public performances can empower people, giving them the confidence to achieve and feel valued by society. Our aim to develop high quality shows that will be performed locally and regionally enhances the opportunity for us to break down the ‘us and them’
stigmatisation that can present itself between community groups. </div>
<div>Your donation, however large, will go towards the vital core runnings costs of Theatricals, ensuring the group keeps running week after week. Your donation will also give the group immense pride and satisfaction, showing them that the general public are hugely supportive of what they are doing and the performances they are creating.</div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why Drama?</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Drama is a fantastic way of building confidence, self esteem and gives adults with learning disabilities the chance to explore their imagination in a safe and nuturing environment. </p>
<p>As Drama isn't overly reliant on cognitive ability it addresses the needs of participants at different levels. Through the use of touch, musical instruments and objects the group are able to gain a sensory experience. Drama is also highly interactive, playful and fun, giving participants a sense of mastery and achievement that they may not get elsewhere. </p>
<p>Drama can also help enhance employability skills. D<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">rama-based methods are

and help address thoughts, feelings and </span>behaviours<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.</span></p>
