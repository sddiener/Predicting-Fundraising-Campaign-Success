The residency includes space for creative exchange, discussions and teaching each other our approaches to art and performance making, as well as opportunities to develop our own work in a supportive and stimulating environment. It is our aim to support, ignite and grow each other’s creative practices, as well as engage with other artists in Puerto Rico to generate creative connection and conversation.</span></p>

Hola!! Thank you for taking the time to read our funding campaign for the Artist's Residency and Exchange Puerto Rico 2013. This project is a collaboration with patio taller and their residency program el residencial.
 
First a little bit about the project:
The Artist’s Residency & Exchange is a 10 day cultural creative exchange between artists from Toronto, New York City, Australia and Puerto Rico. The residency includes space for creative exchange, discussions and teaching each other our approaches to art and performance making, as well as opportunities to develop our own work in a supportive and stimulating environment. It is our aim to support, ignite and grow each other’s creative practices, as well as engage with other artists in Puerto Rico to generate creative connection and conversation.
Common elements which bring the participating artists together include: the importance of framing our work with our politics, a desire to create shifts in ourselves and our communities through creative expression and to be a part of a creative community. Elements which are different in our practices may include the processes we use and the style of work we make.
This isn't the first time we do this. Back in September 2011 Sunny Drake and Awilda Rodríguez Lora met in Toronto for 7 days intensively where gave birth to two new solo works: “X” by Sunny Drake and “El Velorio de La Comay” by Awilda Rodríguez Lora.
 
Now 2 years later we are excited to come to Puerto Rico to collaborate with the organization patio taller as part of their residency program el residencial and they will be hosting 6 artists to have a time to focus on their individual creative practice and to exchange with other artist in the residency and with community members of patio taller.
 
patio taller is a creative space for artist and community members to meet and share. patio taller can be anywhere there is a space, it’s nature is to be mobile, but since 2011 their headquarters has been the casa e nonó(Nonó’s house) located in the neighborhood of San Anton, Carolina. Nonó’s granddaughters opened the space so it can become a meeting place for members of the community of San Anton. It is a place where the artist and the community can create and exchange while embracing sustainability and solidarity.
 
Thevision of patio taller is to promote a social/cultural exchange between community members and artist by having conversations, workshops, residencies and a creative practice that allows for an exchange of skills, stories and art. The space is open for artist that are already active in the community of San Anton and  artists in the island and abroad.

<p><strong><em>What’s Muchness?</em></strong></p>
<p>Muchness is the spark of positivity, creativity, confidence and individuality that fuels you. So many of us used to be much Muchier. As adults, we often lose our Muchness. The day to day routines, the disappointments that sometimes seem like they’ll never end. We don’t take the time to see the joy. <em>We forget to be inspired.</em></p>
<p><img alt=""Pic of Tova Gold"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://findingmymuchness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/FindingMyMuchness_TovaGold.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Hi, My name is Tova Gold and Finding My Muchness is a passion project I began as part of my healing journey after my identical twin girls were stillborn at 24 weeks due to Twin-to-Twin-Transfusion Syndrome.</p>
<p>Inviting joy back into my life in the form of sparkle and color on the outside ultimately helped me re-find the light, joy &amp; confidence that I was missing on the inside. It's now my goal to help everyone find their MUCHNESS!</p>
<p>The first step in finding your Muchness is tuning into your “Muchness Moments.” Those fleeting moments of joy, confidence, or happiness that so frequently get overlooked in the hectic stress filled moments of our lives. </p>
<p><strong><em>I want to help you capture your Muchness Moments and start seeing the light again.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>It's really important to create a tangible way to watch your Muchness Moments accumulate.</em></p>
<ul>
<li> Maybe you need a bit of direction looking for them, or a way to grasp the ‘feeling’ that comes over you when you are feeling connected to your Muchness. It’s that ‘feeling’ that is the key to finding your Muchness. After all, it’s hidden in those tiny moments.</li>
<li>Maybe you know someone that could benefit from seeing the light filled moments that are surrounding them? Maybe they are going through a rough patch or seem trapped in grief or darkness? Maybe they’ve even said to you <em>“I wish I knew how to stop feeling this way... I’m so tired of this anger, sadness, or feeling so disconnected.”</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Feeling like that hurts. And it’s heavy. I know. It’s how I felt after our girls died. But <strong>I made the choice to break my destructive thought patterns and so can you.</strong></p>
<p>The fact is, our thought patterns become habit and when we go through rough times, it can become HABIT to see everything through that lense.</p>
<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.48449245980009437"">I designed these cards to help you break the cycle and create a new habit. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.48449245980009437"">One where you <em>acknowledge your joyful moments.</em> </strong></li>
<li><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.48449245980009437"">Where you <em>congratulate yourself</em> for a tiny moment of <em>feeling empowered, or confident, or even silly</em>. </strong></li>
<li><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.48449245980009437"">Where you <em>celebrate the little accomplishments</em> that will take you to the next step of healing and your own Muchness discovery!</strong></li>

<h2>What is the 30 Day Deck of Muchness Moments?</h2>

<div>
<p>I've designed this deck of 30 small cards + a matching sticker all packaged in a beautiful drawstring bag. The fronts are filled with beautiful quotes, and on the backs contain simple little daily exercise prompts.</p>
<p>The prompts are designed to help you celebrate the tiny moments that make you feel GOOD. When you remember how that feels you can intentionally create MORE of those moments for yourself.</p>

<p><em><strong>***Check out the other perks below!***</strong></em></p>
<p>The set of cards generally comes beautifully packaged in a velvet drawstring bag. <strong>If you are among the first 50 to snag the silk bag option, yours will arrive in a silk bag made from the same beautiful rich colors and fabrics used to make our popular <a href=""http://shop.findingmymuchness.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Muchness Bands</a>.</strong> </p>

<p>The included sticker goes on any jar in your home. After filling out your card with your Muchness Moment you slip it into the jar. As the days pass and you watch the cards accumulate you’ll be able to see a literal display of your Muchness Moments and how they’ve happened all around you, and how many blessings and strengths you really have. <br/><br/><strong>If you make the commitment to fill out one card every day for 30 days, I guarantee you will feel different at the end of those 30 days</strong>. You will find yourself creating MuchnessMoments that simply didn’t exist before. You will feel <strong>lighter</strong> and<strong> less overwhelmed.</strong> You’ll feel a sense of<strong> gratitude</strong> for the blessings you do have, and <strong>compassion</strong> for those with less. You’ll feel more<strong> confident</strong>, more <strong>optimistic</strong>, and more <strong>capable</strong> of achieving the goals you want to set for yourself. </p>

Maybe you know someone that could benefit from seeing the light filled moments that are surrounding them? Maybe they are going through a rough patch or seem trapped in grief or darkness? Maybe they’ve even said to you “I wish I knew how to stop feeling this way... I’m so tired of this anger, sadness, or feeling so disconnected.”


Feeling like that hurts. And it’s heavy. I know. It’s how I felt after our girls died. But I made the choice to break my destructive thought patterns and so can you.
The fact is, our thought patterns become habit and when we go through rough times, it can become HABIT to see everything through that lense.
I designed these cards to help you break the cycle and create a new habit. 

One where you acknowledge your joyful moments. 
Where you congratulate yourself for a tiny moment of feeling empowered, or confident, or even silly. 
Where you celebrate the little accomplishments that will take you to the next step of healing and your own Muchness discovery!

What is the 30 Day Deck of Muchness Moments?



I've designed this deck of 30 small cards + a matching sticker all packaged in a beautiful drawstring bag. The fronts are filled with beautiful quotes, and on the backs contain simple little daily exercise prompts.
The prompts are designed to help you celebrate the tiny moments that make you feel GOOD. When you remember how that feels you can intentionally create MORE of those moments for yourself.

The fronts with their glittery quotes.

The backs with their thoughtful prompts.
***Check out the other perks below!***
The set of cards generally comes beautifully packaged in a velvet drawstring bag. If you are among the first 50 to snag the silk bag option, yours will arrive in a silk bag made from the same beautiful rich colors and fabrics used to make our popular Muchness Bands. 

The included sticker goes on any jar in your home. After filling out your card with your Muchness Moment you slip it into the jar. As the days pass and you watch the cards accumulate you’ll be able to see a literal display of your Muchness Moments and how they’ve happened all around you, and how many blessings and strengths you really have. If you make the commitment to fill out one card every day for 30 days, I guarantee you will feel different at the end of those 30 days. You will find yourself creating MuchnessMoments that simply didn’t exist before. You will feel lighter and less overwhelmed. You’ll feel a sense of gratitude for the blessings you do have, and compassion for those with less. You’ll feel more confident, more optimistic, and more capable of achieving the goals you want to set for yourself. 
Perks & Bonuses!
Designed to inspire, Muchness Bands are our popular multi-functional accessory. Made of silk + sequins, these bands are meant to be a physical reminder to remember to see your Muchness Moments.

<p><strong>What &amp; Why</strong></p>
<p>Quasimodo is a Charlotte, NC, network of creatives collaborating to ensure that the artistic pulse of Charlotte is seen and felt during the Democratic National Convention and thereafter.</p>
<p>It is a ground-up, non-political initiative, not tied to a single organization, but borne of the professional artists and designers themselves, with support from leading cultural institutions.</p>
<p>Our mission is to create, enable, and showcase the best, most innovative, challenging and accessible cultural offerings of the region during the DNC; and, more importantly, to build a lasting platform for large-scale collaboration of the most capable Charlotte creatives and organizations well beyond the DNC.</p>
<p><strong>Our Vision</strong></p>
<p>The Quasimodo Project was conceived in order for it to become a model for future collaboration within the Charlotte creative community, as a way of inspiring and realizing creative projects and making them accessible to all Charlotte citizens and visitors. </p>
<p class=""p1"">As a young and speedily growing city, Charlotte has an opportunity to develop it’s own cultural language in a way that is unusual compared to other cities- we get to essentially make up our own history in the arts. The Quasimodo Project aims to support the city of Charlotte as a shining center of growth in this country; full of opportunities. The cultural aspect of a city reveals the personalities, strengths, and stories of a community, which we believe to be integral to Charlotte’s growth.  A progressive and sophisticated art presence not only affects the city’s humanitarian heartbeat, but also adds valuable cultural capital which financially pours back into the city. </p>

I've been working on this project for most of the year 2011. As I progressed along I realised that I needed some help to launch the book.

What is it about

It's a collection of recent art based on the theme of archetypes. My own personal vision of very ancient themes. 

The book will happen anyway, but...

I am aware of that I will not really earn anything for the long months I have invested in this but I really wanted it to be a high quality product. To achieve this I have appealed to several professionals, and of course I had and will have a lot of publicity expenses, especially since I plan to launch this at Eastercon in 2012 and I must finance this trip.


I will need to buy a small quantity of books (I am printing it on blurb.com) to offer on that occasion
I had the English text proof read by a professional, and it will be translated in French, both these bring more expenses
And last but not least I had a graphic designer design the final product.
All in all I need to raise 5'000$ to cover these expenses




And if you help you can get something nice in return

You can pledge anything from 5$, just to help me along. But depending on the sum you can pledge you may get a little gift in exchange. 
You can of course just donate any sum and have my undying gratitude. But if you want one of the offered perks, you need to select this when you donate. Feel free to email me with questions: dr4gonlady@hotmail.com

After graduating from MICA in Baltimore, I moved sight-unseen to New Orleans. I wanted to explore the culture, particularly the art of costuming and street parades. When one dresses in costume, one subverts the mundane. The ordinary is overturned when one explores oneself as an alternative persona/entity/figure through costume. When one dresses in costume, one enters a ritualistic space where alternative forms of self are allowed to surface. I strive to facilitate this discovery for others, helping them to find a sense of beauty through the act of changing clothes.<br/><br/>“Astral Glamour” is a multisexual (unrestrained by gender or sex) collection of pieces for the body. The collection seeks to transform everyday articles of clothing by infusing high-end fashion detailing and contemporary fiber art meshed with costume making and celebratory garish tendencies.

Your contributions will help me achieve my goal of helping people utilize costume as a fun medium to subvert the ordinary. I also hope the collection will highlight the notion that through wearing art you become art yourself.<br/><br/>The funds will be used for the following: fabric such as spandex, tulle, cotton and lace; decorative miscellaneous objects such as keys, feathers, sequin appliques, and studs; and essentials such as thread, paint, elastic, polyester stuffing, and needles.

<h3></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p></p></span></span></span>
<p></p>
<p>As residency artists at NARS-Foundation we have 3 month during
this summer to accomplish this community based art project. Our time is
limited. Until the end of September the work must be completed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately our professional videocamera broke down, and we
are lacking the budget for a short-term substitute. We have to purchase a new
device to be able to continue. We need it every single day.</p>
<p>Our project is asking:</p>
<p>What is the habitable city?</p>
<p>We are looking to find answers by those who have left the race
of time, those who don´t have anymore rivals, because they stand outside the
common values, outside the warily filled time.</p>
<p>For these project these are the elderly.</p>
<p>On the way to find answers we roam about the different boroughs
of Brooklyn, which are in the midst of gentrification, seeking for conversations
with the ones, who have lived in the neighborhoods for a very long time.</p>
<p>The fragments of those narrations are then assembled  with
processed film materiel to a spatial arrangement within the art space. Our
vision is to create an complex video work about the silent transformations of
personal territories.</p>
<p>We are no organization. We are only standing here and trying
out. If everything turns out fine, we will have in foreseeable time a space

<p>They make the city inhabitable. </p>
<p></p></span></span></div>","As residency artists at NARS-Foundation we have 3 month during
this summer to accomplish this community based art project. Our time is
limited. Until the end of September the work must be completed.
Unfortunately our professional videocamera broke down, and we
are lacking the budget for a short-term substitute. We have to purchase a new
device to be able to continue. We need it every single day.
Our project is asking:
What is the habitable city?
We are looking to find answers by those who have left the race
of time, those who don´t have anymore rivals, because they stand outside the
common values, outside the warily filled time.
For these project these are the elderly.
On the way to find answers we roam about the different boroughs
of Brooklyn, which are in the midst of gentrification, seeking for conversations
with the ones, who have lived in the neighborhoods for a very long time.
The fragments of those narrations are then assembled  with
processed film materiel to a spatial arrangement within the art space. Our
vision is to create an complex video work about the silent transformations of
personal territories.
We are no organization. We are only standing here and trying
out. If everything turns out fine, we will have in foreseeable time a space
filled with the images of the elder, their narrations about places, the
relicts, which are connected with forgotten stories and transitory gestures.
They make the city inhabitable.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>An Artist Residency in Detroit, Michigan.</h3>
<ul>
<li>An English artist, painter, sculptor and photographer, doing first ever artist-in-residency!</li>
<li>Engaging with Detroit and its people, looking for ways for artistic culture to improve Detroiters' lives. At Spread Art, Rosa Parks Blvd. from Nov 1st - 20th, 2016. Show on Nov 19th.</li>
<li>An opportunity for an intensive work-spurt to take my art to the next level. AND a big experiment to work with young Detroiters to put on a socially engaged performance in just three weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am originally from London.  I'm looking forward to the <strong>inspiration of the big city</strong>, where new ideas are born, where change happens, and where culture is formed by thousands of different people in close proximity. <strong>Detroit </strong>is changing rapidly with a <strong>big art influx</strong>, but still has many problems. Detroiters are aware of the <strong>social divide</strong> in their city and the nation. My aim is to find ways toward closing that rift, both through my own work and through providing a platform for young Detroit talent.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>To (almost) cover the cost, I will need $1,900 </h3>
<p>Breaking it down in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>3 week residency $450 + Utilities $50 = $500</p></li>
<li><p>Paying performers something for work and expenses $400 (more, I hope!)</p></li>
<li>Art Materials $400</li>
<li>Printing 11”x 17” Flyposting &amp; Photocopying $60</li>
<li>Driving 140 mile round trip twice bringing self and materials + equipment =$52</li>
<li>Driving to venues (Galleries, museums, grocery stores, etc.) within greater Detroit $25</li>
<li><p>Food (extra cost of) away from home: $10 X 21 days = $210</p></li>
<li><p>Other expenses incl costumes/props for performance $95</p></li>
<li><p>Fundraising (deductions by Indiegogo, credit card processing, publicizing etc.)  $158</p></li>
<li><p>Total adds up to $1,900. Admittedly, it may cost a little more than this in total, but it's enough financially to make the residency a total success.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What is the world without art and culture?</h3>
<p>Gadgets are fun and gizmos are handy, (or is it the other way around?) but without the arts how can we be human?</p>
<ul>
<li>Culture is our strongest weapon in the struggle against violence, racism and inequality. Art and collaborative ventures amplify and create new social possibilities. Let's think big!</li>
<li>This is my first chance to open up my ideas to new and bigger audience. It's an amazing opportunity to be in Detroit and build on the buzz of the rapidly changing city.</li>
<li>I have over ten years of experience in working with Art and young people in the museum environment (plus with my own sons.)  I have organizational experience in co-running an art gallery (Dancing Dog Gallery, Ann Arbor) and running a local bi-annual Art Walk (Westside Art Hop.) This time, I will be free to promote and develop my own work, and have an uninterrupted three-week period to make a big project of visual art, music and performance.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Three weeks is a short time to create a body of new work of my own, let alone gather some talented young people and create a performance work from scratch! But, a leap of faith (along with some steely determination and organizing skills) can wreak miracles. With your help.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. Whether or not you can purchase a perk, you can still help enormously:</p>

<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>I have played music since I was a teenager, mostly with the aim to get up on stage and feel something special. I have been an insatiable music fan since I was four years-old. When my kids were born (now 15 and 12) I made a switch from rehearsing and performing with bands, to trying to record my own things in the basement -- keeping me more present for my young family and my wife.</p>
<p>As it turned out, what I wrote and recorded wasn't awful, especially given that I only really know how to play bass and drums. I worked hard to learn enough guitar, keys and production skills to make it sound proper -- with loads of great input from friends.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where I am</h3>
<p>I've already recorded my album. All new songs -- even though I have about 100, these 13 songs are almost all written and recorded since June.</p>
<p>The album is ready -- 16 and 24-bit masters and some for vinyl. I've registered them all and have all the coding and stuff taken care of. I'm still paying for the engineering, but I'm doing that myself.</p>
<p>What I need is $3,500 to get the album to press. 200 CDs will cost me $728 and 100 LPs will cost $2,500-$3,000.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your help</h3>
<p>If I can fund pressing this album, it will help me realise a long-time goal, perhaps lifetime goal. This is bucket list item #1. I've talked about this dream for many years. Money is my only obstacle.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>No money?</h3>
<p>Obviously, I get that or I wouldn't be here. Please share this pitch and maybe I can reach someone I would not have otherwise got to. That's just as good as funding.</p>

<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">The Spiva Sketchbook Project: <i>Year One Community Launch</i></b><br/>
</h3>
</div><p>Hi. My name is Josie Mai, and I am the new Executive Director of <a href=""http://spivaarts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spiva Center for the Arts </a>in Joplin, Missouri. I love this place so much, I volunteered for 10 years before I got the job. While volunteering, I created exhibitions, curriculum, and programs for this 70-year old gem. George Spiva, founder, made his money by selling dynamite to the local miners turn of last century. Now I'm ready to blow our community's minds and hearts with the Spiva Sketchbook Project. Pun absolutely intended! 5 years ago, Joplin endured an EF5 tornado. Many lives were lost and almost a third of the city was leveled. Art in community has helped us heal, and this project is a next step toward creative recovery; a chance to write and draw new stories and histories.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464727731/Sketchbook_Kit_kks60w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>There are two simple parts to the Project. </p><p></p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Part I: Sketchbook Archive</b><br/></p>
<p>Regional
artists are invited to a year-long sketchbook project. Interested artists
request a sketchbook, it is mailed to the artist, and the artist has one year
to fill the sketchbook. Sketchbook is mailed back to Spiva and then becomes the
property of Spiva Center for the Arts and is archived in the Rachel Salzer library where the
community may come view the books. Books will be digitized and made available
on the Spiva website. Prompts will be available on the website to encourage the
artists. In addition to the archive of sketchbooks, an exhibit will be mounted
featuring a range of two-page spreads. <b><i>The ultimate goal of Part 1 is to have
100 participating artists the first year creatively and concurrently
documenting their thoughts, interests, hopes, and dreams.</i></b> These are then shared
locally through exhibition and globally via the web.</p>
<p><b>Part 2: Community-Wide Sketchbook</b></p>
<p>A series of monthly adult workshops
will be offered at Spiva. Participants receive a Sketchbook Starter Kit that
includes a sketchbook and various mark-making materials. They are encouraged to
come to each month’s offering and continue to work into the sketchbook included
in the kit. Artists enrolled in Part 1 can attend workshops for free. Others
need to invest $10 per session. Each month a new technique will be introduced.
Each workshop will be on the second Saturday of the month, noon-2pm, can hold
up to 20 participants, and will be facilitated by various local artists and
Spiva staff.  Participants will be
encouraged to attend monthly, but supplies for 40 participants will be
purchased to ensure at least 20 participants each month. There will be incentives
for regular attenders, such as a chance to exhibit or be published in a
collective book documenting the Spiva Sketchbook Project year.</p>
<p></p><p>The 12 Workshops
include Doodling, Collage, Writing Prompts, Mapping,
Printmaking, and much more. Workshops will take place at Spiva. A highly
successful Coloring Book Club, a partnership with Connect2Culture and the Post
Art Library, will be folded into the schedule of adult workshops.</p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>
<p>In addition
to the adult workshops, there will be community outreach to 6th grade art
programs near Spiva: North Middle School and St Peter’s Junior High. The Tweens are often neglected, so this project is for them to be seen and heard! Facilitators will go out to these organizations once a month for the year and
teach the same workshops above. <b><i>The ultimate goal of Part 2 is
to engage the entire community in the concurrent creative documenting of their
thoughts, interests, hopes, and dreams, inside and outside of the art center.</i></b></p>
<p>Participants

</div></div>","The Spiva Sketchbook Project: Year One Community Launch

Hi. My name is Josie Mai, and I am the new Executive Director of Spiva Center for the Arts in Joplin, Missouri. I love this place so much, I volunteered for 10 years before I got the job. While volunteering, I created exhibitions, curriculum, and programs for this 70-year old gem. George Spiva, founder, made his money by selling dynamite to the local miners turn of last century. Now I'm ready to blow our community's minds and hearts with the Spiva Sketchbook Project. Pun absolutely intended! 5 years ago, Joplin endured an EF5 tornado. Many lives were lost and almost a third of the city was leveled. Art in community has helped us heal, and this project is a next step toward creative recovery; a chance to write and draw new stories and histories.There are two simple parts to the Project. Part I: Sketchbook Archive
Regional
artists are invited to a year-long sketchbook project. Interested artists
request a sketchbook, it is mailed to the artist, and the artist has one year
to fill the sketchbook. Sketchbook is mailed back to Spiva and then becomes the
property of Spiva Center for the Arts and is archived in the Rachel Salzer library where the
community may come view the books. Books will be digitized and made available
on the Spiva website. Prompts will be available on the website to encourage the
artists. In addition to the archive of sketchbooks, an exhibit will be mounted
featuring a range of two-page spreads. The ultimate goal of Part 1 is to have
100 participating artists the first year creatively and concurrently
documenting their thoughts, interests, hopes, and dreams. These are then shared
locally through exhibition and globally via the web.
Part 2: Community-Wide Sketchbook
A series of monthly adult workshops
will be offered at Spiva. Participants receive a Sketchbook Starter Kit that
includes a sketchbook and various mark-making materials. They are encouraged to
come to each month’s offering and continue to work into the sketchbook included
in the kit. Artists enrolled in Part 1 can attend workshops for free. Others
need to invest $10 per session. Each month a new technique will be introduced.
Each workshop will be on the second Saturday of the month, noon-2pm, can hold
up to 20 participants, and will be facilitated by various local artists and
Spiva staff.  Participants will be
encouraged to attend monthly, but supplies for 40 participants will be
purchased to ensure at least 20 participants each month. There will be incentives
for regular attenders, such as a chance to exhibit or be published in a
collective book documenting the Spiva Sketchbook Project year.
The 12 Workshops
include Doodling, Collage, Writing Prompts, Mapping,
Printmaking, and much more. Workshops will take place at Spiva. A highly
successful Coloring Book Club, a partnership with Connect2Culture and the Post
Art Library, will be folded into the schedule of adult workshops.
In addition
to the adult workshops, there will be community outreach to 6th grade art
programs near Spiva: North Middle School and St Peter’s Junior High. The Tweens are often neglected, so this project is for them to be seen and heard! Facilitators will go out to these organizations once a month for the year and
teach the same workshops above. The ultimate goal of Part 2 is
to engage the entire community in the concurrent creative documenting of their
thoughts, interests, hopes, and dreams, inside and outside of the art center.
Participants
will be surveyed at a few points during the year to get program feedback and a
sincere attempt to determine a fair participant cost in future years. What We Need
$2000 Sketchbook Starter Kit for 40 adults, $50/kit $1000 Supplies for 40 children $1000 Adult workshop facilitation $1000 Community outreach facilitation $10,000 Staff administration$2000 Scanner/technology$1000 Frames for exhibit $3000 Exhibit sponsorship $1000 Marketing/web $1000 Library remodel $1000 Book production $500 Mailing

</p><p>El equipo técnico y pedagógico,
venimos a pedir ayuda para financiar la compra de material para la
escuela <b>EFA ABIDIN KAID SALEH DE LA RASD</b>, es decir la escuela
de cine de los campamentos de refugiados Saharauis.</p>
<p>La escuela se formó hace 5 años con
la intención de crear un espacio para la gente joven, que es la que
más está sufriendo el abandono y el exilio, pues muchos ya han
terminado sus carreras universitarias y no todos encuentran un empleo
en los campamentos. 
</p>
<p>Acostumbrados a una vida de estudiantes
en capitales como <b>Argel o la Habana</b>, su situación es muy
delicada y difícil pues encuentran pocas oportunidades de ocio y
entretenimiento en los campamentos.</p>
<p>Hay jóvenes que no han cursado
estudios <b>universitarios</b> y necesitan otro tipo de ofertas educativas, por eso se han creado programas de formación profesional en los propios campamentos dónde introduce el <b>cine, el vídeo y la televisión</b>. Entre sus
oportunidades estamos fomentando el estudio de nuevas disciplinas que
muchos jóvenes pueden encontrar atractivas!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Estos <b>refugiados</b> vienen de un
mundo <b>libre</b> en el que era común disfrutar de una <b>sala de cine
</b>o de una obra de teatro, las condiciones les obligaron a preocuparse
de su supervivencia y sus necesidades básicas, la cultura ya se
entiende como una de ellas y por ellos proyectos como éste se hacen
cada vez más necesarios en poblaciones desfavorecidas.</p>
<p>Seis años después y tras el éxito de
las actividades de tipo didáctico desarrolladas en torno al <b>Festival
Internacional de Cine del Sahara</b>, fundamentalmente talleres de
formación, se observa una fuerte demanda educativa entre la
población joven saharaui, demanda que propone a su vez el deseo de
establecer de manera continuada un Centro de Formación Audiovisual y
la necesidad de <b>preservar y difundir mediante la realización
audiovisual la idiosincrasia y el acervo cultural del pueblo
saharaui</b>, el castellano como segunda lengua y la participación en
festivales de cine en los campamentos y en el extranjero. 
</p>
<p>Además, desde hace algunos años los
campamentos cuentan con un canal de televisión que demanda
profesionales.</p>
<p>Fruto de este deseo fue el inicio de la
construcción de la Escuela de Formación Audiovisual Abidin Kaid
Saleh de la RASD que inició sus clases en septiembre de 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Con esta campaña queremos recaudar
dinero para comprar más material para la escuela. 
</p>
<p>Debido a los recortes que vivimos en
España a nivel estatal, el nivel de ayudas a disminuido
drásticamente, y nos encontramos en una situación dónde ahora más
que nunca, necesitamos recurrir a la ayuda del crowfunding para
incentivar un proyecto como éste. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>	- Porque <b>creemos</b> que es
necesario mejorar y incrementar el material que la escuela ya tiene.</p>
<p>	-Para dar <b>respuesta</b> a la
demanda creciente de estudiar en la escuela por parte de los jóvenes
	saharauis.</p>
<p>	-Porque creemos en la escuela y
sabemos que este material será un elemento clave para la
	<b>profesionalización, tecnificación y mejora de los contenidos.</b></p>
<p>En caso de no conseguir los fondos,
estamos dispuestos a buscar financiación dónde sea necesario,
recurriendo a los métodos más tradicionales. Pero creemos que esta
es una forma de dar a conocer el proyecto y hacer a todo el mundo
partícipe de la escuela y su desarrollo. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Con este proyecto pedimos <b>2800</b> euros,
que irán destinados a:</p>
<p>
</p><p>	-<b>Ordenador</b>: Ordenador potente que
permita a los alumnos, editar vídeos en full HD i si 	tenemos la
posibilidad en un futuro cercano de trabajar en 4k y RAW, etalonar y
retocar el 	color, trabajar con herramientas 3d y de posproducción
así como motion graphics, editar 	sonido, mezcla y mástering. Para
poder conseguir productos audiovisuales con una calidad 	óptima y
que se acerquen lo máximo posible a los estándares de calidad que
estan y estamos 	acostumbrados en el mercado audiovisual.</p>
<p>	-<b>Tarjeta de sonido</b>:  Para que los
alumnos puedan grabar con más calidad voces en off,	 	grabar su
propia musica si es necesario, mezclar y masterizar con más
fidelidad.</p>
<p>	-<b>Altavoces de respuesta plana</b>: 
Altavoces que permitan mezclar y masterizar con más 	precisión.De
esta forma tener mucho más control del sonido para acercarse más al
sonido de 	los espacios dónde se puedan ver en un futuro los
largometrajes o cortometrajes. 
</p>
<p>	-<b>Micrófono de condensador</b>: Para poder
grabar sus propias canciones, cantantes, voces en of, 	doblajes,
etc...</p>
<p>	-<b>Teclado controlador MIDI</b>: Para
producir su propia música o bases sonoras para conseguir 	un diseño
de sonido más acurado.</p>
<p>	-<b>Monitores</b>: Monitores LCD que
permitirán ser más efectivos en el retoque de color, edición,
	postproducción etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somos conscientes de la situación
económica que se vive en España y sabemos lo necesaria que es la
ayuda para muchas familias y ONG's que actúan en el ámbito
nacional. A pesar de esto, nos vemos obligados a pedir ayuda siendo
conscientes también de la situación de exilio y refugio en que vive
el pueblo Saharaui. Entendemos también que el cine no es una
necesidad vital o de primera instancia, pero creemos que el arte, ha
ayudado y ayudará a los jóvenes a canalizar sus emociones, a crear
un nuevo espacio pedagógico y creativo para que los jóvenes salgan
de sus rutinas y puedan expresarse creativamente. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Una vez recaudado el dinero, haremos un
<b>seguimiento diario de su compra</b>, su envío a los campamentos y su uso
académico en la escuela. Los alumnos harán sus propios videos para
que los que hayáis financiado el proyecto, podáis conocer al <b>100% y
de forma transparente</b>, el uso de este dinero y material.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Para entender el contexto. </b>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>El 14 de noviembre de 1975, se firmaron
en Madrid los Acuerdos Tripartitos por los cuales los españoles
entregaban el Sáhara Occidental a Marruecos y Mauritania. A cambio
de compensaciones económicas y políticas, España abandonó a su
suerte al Pueblo Saharaui. Considerada hasta ese momento como una
provincia española más, el Sahara Occidental es invadido por el
norte por Marruecos con la conocida “marcha verde” y por el sur
por Mauritania que cuatro años después abandonaría la ocupación
reconociendo el derecho del Pueblo Saharaui a su propio territorio.</p>
<p>Desde aquel fatídico año se inició
el éxodo saharaui: han pasado por la frontera entre el Sahara
Occidental y Argelia miles de hombres y mujeres saharauis que han
abandonado su tierra ante la invasión y consecuente represión
marroquí. Los que consiguieron atravesar este desierto se instalaron
en la hammada argelina de la región de Tinduf, “el desierto del
desierto”. A la escasez de agua, luz eléctrica y alimentos se
suman las difíciles condiciones climáticas que tienen que soportar.
Los refugiados saharauis instalaron allí sus jaimas y día a día
han ido organizando sus campamentos conjuntamente con la ayuda
internacional.</p><p>Sólo nos queda daros las gracias por parte del equipo de la escuela y agradeceros con total sinceridad que hayáis destinado unos minutos a leer sobre este proyecto tan interesante.<br/></p><br/></div>","Buenos días!

campamentos cuentan con un canal de televisión que demanda
profesionales.
Fruto de este deseo fue el inicio de la
construcción de la Escuela de Formación Audiovisual Abidin Kaid
Saleh de la RASD que inició sus clases en septiembre de 2010.

Con esta campaña queremos recaudar
dinero para comprar más material para la escuela. 

Debido a los recortes que vivimos en
España a nivel estatal, el nivel de ayudas a disminuido
drásticamente, y nos encontramos en una situación dónde ahora más
que nunca, necesitamos recurrir a la ayuda del crowfunding para
incentivar un proyecto como éste. 


	- Porque creemos que es
necesario mejorar y incrementar el material que la escuela ya tiene.
	-Para dar respuesta a la
demanda creciente de estudiar en la escuela por parte de los jóvenes
	saharauis.
	-Porque creemos en la escuela y
sabemos que este material será un elemento clave para la
	profesionalización, tecnificación y mejora de los contenidos.
En caso de no conseguir los fondos,
estamos dispuestos a buscar financiación dónde sea necesario,
recurriendo a los métodos más tradicionales. Pero creemos que esta
es una forma de dar a conocer el proyecto y hacer a todo el mundo
partícipe de la escuela y su desarrollo. 


Con este proyecto pedimos 2800 euros,
que irán destinados a:

	-Ordenador: Ordenador potente que
permita a los alumnos, editar vídeos en full HD i si 	tenemos la
posibilidad en un futuro cercano de trabajar en 4k y RAW, etalonar y
retocar el 	color, trabajar con herramientas 3d y de posproducción
así como motion graphics, editar 	sonido, mezcla y mástering. Para
poder conseguir productos audiovisuales con una calidad 	óptima y
que se acerquen lo máximo posible a los estándares de calidad que
estan y estamos 	acostumbrados en el mercado audiovisual.
	-Tarjeta de sonido:  Para que los
alumnos puedan grabar con más calidad voces en off,	 	grabar su
propia musica si es necesario, mezclar y masterizar con más
fidelidad.
	-Altavoces de respuesta plana: 
Altavoces que permitan mezclar y masterizar con más 	precisión.De
esta forma tener mucho más control del sonido para acercarse más al
sonido de 	los espacios dónde se puedan ver en un futuro los
largometrajes o cortometrajes. 

	-Micrófono de condensador: Para poder
grabar sus propias canciones, cantantes, voces en of, 	doblajes,
etc...
	-Teclado controlador MIDI: Para
producir su propia música o bases sonoras para conseguir 	un diseño
de sonido más acurado.
	-Monitores: Monitores LCD que
permitirán ser más efectivos en el retoque de color, edición,
	postproducción etc...

Somos conscientes de la situación
económica que se vive en España y sabemos lo necesaria que es la
ayuda para muchas familias y ONG's que actúan en el ámbito
nacional. A pesar de esto, nos vemos obligados a pedir ayuda siendo
conscientes también de la situación de exilio y refugio en que vive
el pueblo Saharaui. Entendemos también que el cine no es una
necesidad vital o de primera instancia, pero creemos que el arte, ha
ayudado y ayudará a los jóvenes a canalizar sus emociones, a crear
un nuevo espacio pedagógico y creativo para que los jóvenes salgan
de sus rutinas y puedan expresarse creativamente. 


Una vez recaudado el dinero, haremos un
seguimiento diario de su compra, su envío a los campamentos y su uso
académico en la escuela. Los alumnos harán sus propios videos para
que los que hayáis financiado el proyecto, podáis conocer al 100% y
de forma transparente, el uso de este dinero y material.

Para entender el contexto. 


El 14 de noviembre de 1975, se firmaron
en Madrid los Acuerdos Tripartitos por los cuales los españoles
entregaban el Sáhara Occidental a Marruecos y Mauritania. A cambio
de compensaciones económicas y políticas, España abandonó a su
suerte al Pueblo Saharaui. Considerada hasta ese momento como una
provincia española más, el Sahara Occidental es invadido por el
norte por Marruecos con la conocida “marcha verde” y por el sur
por Mauritania que cuatro años después abandonaría la ocupación
reconociendo el derecho del Pueblo Saharaui a su propio territorio.
Desde aquel fatídico año se inició
el éxodo saharaui: han pasado por la frontera entre el Sahara
Occidental y Argelia miles de hombres y mujeres saharauis que han
abandonado su tierra ante la invasión y consecuente represión
marroquí. Los que consiguieron atravesar este desierto se instalaron
en la hammada argelina de la región de Tinduf, “el desierto del
desierto”. A la escasez de agua, luz eléctrica y alimentos se
suman las difíciles condiciones climáticas que tienen que soportar.
Los refugiados saharauis instalaron allí sus jaimas y día a día
han ido organizando sus campamentos conjuntamente con la ayuda
internacional.Sólo nos queda daros las gracias por parte del equipo de la escuela y agradeceros con total sinceridad que hayáis destinado unos minutos a leer sobre este proyecto tan interesante.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I have teamed up with BAPS JAPON, the Japan's first and only website featuring burlesque and pinup scenes both in and outside of Japan. So far we have introduced many burlesque performers and pinup models, produced burlesque shows and pinup events, collaborated with a educational burlesque convention, premiered indie movies such as <i>The Burlesque Assassins </i>and <i>It's All That Gilitters</i>, and published <i>BAPS zine</i>,<i> </i>the Japan's first-ever magazine about Japanese and international scenes of burlesque and pinup. Since we have no sponsors, all of these activities have been simply done by passion of Toy, the founder of BAPS JAPON, volunteers and myself who all believe in these cultures and wish the community grow in Japan.  </p>
<p>Now BAPS JAPON is having the 5th anniversary. As a celebration, we are working very hard to make our dream projects happen. The Japan premiere of the award-winning documentary film about the pinup icon Bettie Page, <i>Bettie Page Reveals All</i>, and the biggest burlesque showcase in the Japanese modern burlesque history, <i>Burlesk-O-Futurama</i>.</p>

The team has decided that every single dollar over campaign goals will be saved and put into the NEXT video!<br/><br/>To thank you for your support, we will be offering multiple tiers, from fan level perks with swag and merchandise, all the way up to producer perks!<br/><br/>Roy and Jaxon at WO, along with our many friends and acquaintances with and relevant weapons will be volunteering our time, expertise, equipment and weapons to support the campaign, but we are definitely not going to asking the actors and professionals working on this to work for free!  <br/><br/>We at WO won't take a dime, and in the spirit of transparency, here is where all the money is going!<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594774698/xlprhebzreworngoqhoh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

In order to bring the adventures of Raifu-01 and company to life in a manner that's worth your support and time, we need to raise a budget. Your financial assistance will allow us to:- Rent professional film equipment (we already have all the firearms! ^_^)
- Professional scripting
- Real world weapons and tactics consulting from experienced professionals
- Transportation and logistics
- Handle production costs such as SFX, stunts, editing and original music to make it super badass
- Create more awesome swag and stickers / patches based on our charactersOur goal is definitely QUALITY over quantity so scripting, actors, production, and post production will all be professional grade, just like our preview video/intro!We're hoping to make multiple videos, but depending on how much funding we are able to crowdsource, we will adjust length and quantity of videos accordingly! The team has decided that every single dollar over campaign goals will be saved and put into the NEXT video!To thank you for your support, we will be offering multiple tiers, from fan level perks with swag and merchandise, all the way up to producer perks!Roy and Jaxon at WO, along with our many friends and acquaintances with and relevant weapons will be volunteering our time, expertise, equipment and weapons to support the campaign, but we are definitely not going to asking the actors and professionals working on this to work for free!  We at WO won't take a dime, and in the spirit of transparency, here is where all the money is going!
 

The Impact
Our team is super passionate about anime and firearms, and we believe we're making a difference in showing that tactical weebery can be portrayed in a positive and entertaining light!
 

Risks & Challenges
Film projects are very expensive and time consuming. Thankfully, with your help and support, we are confident our experienced and talented team will get amazing work done!

 
Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Ebru Eltemur, a curator and visual artist based in New York. Currently studying at NYU Gallatin School of Individualized Study, my interests lie in understanding the politics of art institutions, and curating exhibitions in post-colonial cultural spaces, from museums to public art spaces. My work has been featured at the Gallatin Arts Festival (2017) and “Friends of 8Ball Community” show at Entrance Gallery (2018), and published in independent zines and art review magazines. While I have gained some experience by co-curating, “Slicing Burning Boiling” will be my solo curatorial debut.</p>
<p>Slicing Burning Boiling is an experimental response to the often exclusive and discriminatory nature of the contemporary art market. Featuring young artists who critically interface with capitalist, Euro-centric education systems, the exhibition disrupts the impulse to create commercialized art by exhibiting highly personal, intimate work. Further, it disputes the abusive correlation between value and labor in art-making. In doing so, it renegotiates the “process” of becoming a successful “artist” and questions the authority of those who have established such boundaries for decades.</p> <p>Slicing Burning Boiling analyzes the difficult process of identity-making in a commodified art world, and finding solace in what makes us vulnerable and unique. It is an amalgam of undisclosed thoughts, abused emotions and lessened ambitions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need about 5,500 dollars to fund the rent and decoration of the space and exhibition publications, including an opening reception invitation and catalogue. </p>
<p>The perks you can get are listed on the sidebar!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not able to financially support the project, please spread the word around and invite your friends to see the show. Even the smallest contribution counts!</p>

a series of watercolor works. Inspired by Philip Glass and his minimalism in music, <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I
wanted the images to be minimal; white background, watercolor, the
use of color and mixed media, so that the audience can focus in on
the subject and get lost in the story.

I never thought that my art would make it this far. But it did. And its only going to get better. It is extremely hard to make a career as an artist, the one thing that I can tell you is that I am dedicated, extremely hard working and refuse to give up. If you support me, you will be supporting someone who will see a project through to the end. You can check my track record. I am always up to something exciting and new; if its not collaborating with Erykah Badu or working with the community, then I am studying music in Spain, having a solo exhibit in Seville and planning future solo exhibits in Madrid. My first solo exhibit was at A Space Gallery in Toronto, I have designed dressing rooms for major recording artists, album covers and book covers, received grants and won awards and believe that my future is bright. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">It is true, that grants dont always come through and I am always looking for ways to support my art. If its not taking on commissions, working part time, taking on contracts or if I am very lucky selling my work. But I always seem to find a way. If you cant help with small funds that is ok, but maybe you can help by spreading the word, to people you may know that may either be interested in supporting or interested in purchasing some original works of art or prints. I dont always like to rely on the system I do believe that as a community an arts community, we should and can support eachother.

use of color and mixed media, so that the audience can focus in on
the subject and get lost in the story. This is my story of learning to just accept who it is I am and conquer fear.What We Need & What You GetWhat I need is another $3000 for the continuation of this project, what you'll be helping with my plan to work on 8 more images because it is a series, purchasing art supplies, doing more research, I love the Toronto reference Library and I tend to spend a lot of time there researching ideas and images for upcoming or continued projects. You will also be helping me to stay in my studio so that I can work.WHAT YOU RECEIVE:well, lets make this fun, not only will you receive some amazing art by me, orginal and prints. But I am also offering a night of painting; a painting workshop for you and 2 of your friends, A color theory workshop. If you are an artist yourself, an grant writing workshop for you and 2 of your friends, because I am a grant writing and networking machine. I am happy to share my skills with you. And if you are supporting from out of Canada, then original and print art is what I will offer to you. As well as portraits for you or a loved oneIf full funds are not received, then whatever is mustered up will allow me to still do research and create new images.The Impact I already had an exhibit in the South of Spain which was extremely nerve racking and exciting for me. I never thought that my art would make it this far. But it did. And its only going to get better. It is extremely hard to make a career as an artist, the one thing that I can tell you is that I am dedicated, extremely hard working and refuse to give up. If you support me, you will be supporting someone who will see a project through to the end. You can check my track record. I am always up to something exciting and new; if its not collaborating with Erykah Badu or working with the community, then I am studying music in Spain, having a solo exhibit in Seville and planning future solo exhibits in Madrid. My first solo exhibit was at A Space Gallery in Toronto, I have designed dressing rooms for major recording artists, album covers and book covers, received grants and won awards and believe that my future is bright. Other Ways You Can HelpIt is true, that grants dont always come through and I am always looking for ways to support my art. If its not taking on commissions, working part time, taking on contracts or if I am very lucky selling my work. But I always seem to find a way. If you cant help with small funds that is ok, but maybe you can help by spreading the word, to people you may know that may either be interested in supporting or interested in purchasing some original works of art or prints. I dont always like to rely on the system I do believe that as a community an arts community, we should and can support eachother. Thank You!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We're starting our second campaign for Mountain Cabin Studio. We want to thank everyone who contributed and promoted our first campaign last year! <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mountain-cabin-studio/x/2439563"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">View our first campaign.</a> We were able to reach our goal and get the work so desperately needed done on the cabin in Melrose Montana. It's a giant step in the right direction and we no longer fear the cabin will fall in or have to be torn down. The cabin has a new foundation and the north wall  is no longer structurally unsound. Marty Salusso and Mark Salusso with Centennial Concrete in Butte Montana did all the work. <br/></p><p>New to this campaign, the opportunity for everyone to participate  with the introduction of a referral contest!!!  For information and details, please refer to our updates. A prize will be given every week based on the cumulative analytics of referrals and resulting donations. The grand prize will be a week at the cabin and a week at the cabin donated in your name to a person or group for physical, mental, emotional or spiritual healing!!!<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1186617/files/20150131130257-P1010720.JPG?1422738177"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The cabin had to be moved back from it's original location, with the sun porch moved forward. The old rocks it had been sitting on were moved away. The site was excavated so we could pour our footings 32"" below ground. Then the foundation was poured using Insulated Concrete Forms, or ICF. In the process we were able to put in a new floor and a new course of logs under the cabin all around the bottom, replacing the old ones that were rotten. This was all thanks to the kindness and generosity of our wonderful  supporters and contributors. You are always more than welcome to stay at the cabin and enjoy all that Montana has to offer!!<p> <strong>BEFORE:</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1184728/files/20131026112237-WP_20130607_003_edited_1_.jpg?1422643048"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FDvbMYL2pISQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDvbMYL2pISQ&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FDvbMYL2pISQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p> </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FdfUTjeJkdfU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdfUTjeJkdfU&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FdfUTjeJkdfU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div> <strong>AFTER:</strong><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1184737/files/20150130104219-cabin_north_wall.jpg?1422643339"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Mountain Cabin Studio II <br/></strong></p><p>Picking up where the last campaign left off, the second goal is to complete the restoration of the cabin, estimated at $24,900. We've divided this into two equal parts, in order to insure completion of the more critical aspects of the restoration.  First and foremost, we will re-build the roof per the original design. We will use 4""-5"" logs for the rafters and old rough cut lumber (old barn wood) for the decking. The new rafters will be 16"" on center instead of 24"", like they were. This will also include a new ridge pole, and new logs for the top plates. Leaving the ceiling open for a cathedral ceiling, we will place new king post tie beams at every third rafter, 2' above the wall height. Kay Jensen of Divide Montana harvested and hand peeled the logs last summer so they could dry and be cured for use this summer. Instead of the old rolled roofing, we are going to add  rigid foam insulation and sheet metal roofing, on the cabin and the porch. This will be approximately half, or $12,450 of the second goal, set out in the original campaign dedicated to the completion of the restoration of the cabin.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1188349/files/20150201114203-vacation_july_2011_164.jpg?1422819723"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Just as important, but dependent on the second $12,450, we can wash, bleach, and oil the logs, and put in new chinking. We will reclaim and restore the old windows and doors, re-gluing, filling and oiling the wooden frames and re-glazing where necessary. We will frame in a new door on the north side and reattach and stabilize the porch on the west side. Then all the windows and doors will be reset, insulated, trimmed and painted. The electrical will be rerun providing outlets and lighting. Voila! The cabin is like new.</p><p><strong>Third and Final Goal: Additions and Modernization <br/></strong></p><p>With the hard work behind us, the additions of a wrap around porch (inclusive of the current porch being made into a sun room), bedroom and bathroom will be straight forward, including a small kitchen in the cabin.

We're starting our second campaign for Mountain Cabin Studio. We want to thank everyone who contributed and promoted our first campaign last year! View our first campaign. We were able to reach our goal and get the work so desperately needed done on the cabin in Melrose Montana. It's a giant step in the right direction and we no longer fear the cabin will fall in or have to be torn down. The cabin has a new foundation and the north wall  is no longer structurally unsound. Marty Salusso and Mark Salusso with Centennial Concrete in Butte Montana did all the work. New to this campaign, the opportunity for everyone to participate  with the introduction of a referral contest!!!  For information and details, please refer to our updates. A prize will be given every week based on the cumulative analytics of referrals and resulting donations. The grand prize will be a week at the cabin and a week at the cabin donated in your name to a person or group for physical, mental, emotional or spiritual healing!!!The cabin had to be moved back from it's original location, with the sun porch moved forward. The old rocks it had been sitting on were moved away. The site was excavated so we could pour our footings 32"" below ground. Then the foundation was poured using Insulated Concrete Forms, or ICF. In the process we were able to put in a new floor and a new course of logs under the cabin all around the bottom, replacing the old ones that were rotten. This was all thanks to the kindness and generosity of our wonderful  supporters and contributors. You are always more than welcome to stay at the cabin and enjoy all that Montana has to offer!! BEFORE:  AFTER:Mountain Cabin Studio II Picking up where the last campaign left off, the second goal is to complete the restoration of the cabin, estimated at $24,900. We've divided this into two equal parts, in order to insure completion of the more critical aspects of the restoration.  First and foremost, we will re-build the roof per the original design. We will use 4""-5"" logs for the rafters and old rough cut lumber (old barn wood) for the decking. The new rafters will be 16"" on center instead of 24"", like they were. This will also include a new ridge pole, and new logs for the top plates. Leaving the ceiling open for a cathedral ceiling, we will place new king post tie beams at every third rafter, 2' above the wall height. Kay Jensen of Divide Montana harvested and hand peeled the logs last summer so they could dry and be cured for use this summer. Instead of the old rolled roofing, we are going to add  rigid foam insulation and sheet metal roofing, on the cabin and the porch. This will be approximately half, or $12,450 of the second goal, set out in the original campaign dedicated to the completion of the restoration of the cabin.Just as important, but dependent on the second $12,450, we can wash, bleach, and oil the logs, and put in new chinking. We will reclaim and restore the old windows and doors, re-gluing, filling and oiling the wooden frames and re-glazing where necessary. We will frame in a new door on the north side and reattach and stabilize the porch on the west side. Then all the windows and doors will be reset, insulated, trimmed and painted. The electrical will be rerun providing outlets and lighting. Voila! The cabin is like new.Third and Final Goal: Additions and Modernization With the hard work behind us, the additions of a wrap around porch (inclusive of the current porch being made into a sun room), bedroom and bathroom will be straight forward, including a small kitchen in the cabin. We already have a well and sewer access on the property so it's just a matter of running pipes and getting a pump and pressure tank for the well. Back-fill, grading and some landscaping will finish the job. When completed, this our final goal, to be launched in a separate campaign, will enable us to have guests at the cabin or offer it for retreats and workshops, since even though restored, the cabin is still a one room cabin with an outhouse.   My hope is that Mountain Cabin Studio, set in the rugged wilderness, vast openness and breathtaking beauty of Montana, can take us beyond human impermanence with it’s compulsive posturing, grasping, withholding and obsessing. To bring people to the awareness of beauty and grandeur I first experienced in the wilderness as a child. To foster peace, fortitude and a sense of belonging. To promote physical, mental, emotional and spiritual healing. To offer a sanctuary to those who want to reconnect and rekindle their spirit. Quoting John Muir, ""Wilderness takes you beyond your human existence to become one with nature and the universe.""To complement and reinforce this sense of grace and equanimity,  workshops or sabbaticals can be organized, sponsored and attended by any group, cause or association. Along with the perks offered here and on the first campaign of my art 
and art books (pictured below), you can book a week at the cabin.  Because of your help 
to save the cabin, we want to help others in your name. For 
every week booked by you we will donate a week retreat at the cabin for a
 workshop or sabbatical that supports artists and writers, or supports 
physical, mental, emotional or spiritual healing, such as:Aging and Evolving Retreat:Artists' and Writers' Retreat: paint, write, be inspired Bereavement Retreat: loss of a loved one to cancer, suicide, or traumatic event Bipolar and Mental Challenges Retreat: depression and anxiety, social disorders, addictions Cancer Survivors Retreat: celebrate life and overcome the trauma of an ongoing life threatening diseaseCaregivers Retreat:   Church Groups Retreat:Earth Angels and Healers: Nature Retreat: explore sacred wilderness, Outdoors Man Retreat: rugged outdoor activities Urbanization Isolation Retreat: social isolation, fear, anxiety, lack of community Veterans Retreat: post traumatic stress disorder, re-entering society Yoga and Mindfulness Retreat: holistic fitness, wellness and mindful living Youth Groups Retreat:                                                     <<<<<<< >>>>>>>We had three people book a week at the cabin last campaign, Debbie Miyake, Dave Harris and Carrie Mayhew.

<p>As an artist I challenge the people of Queens, NYC - and beyond - to help me defy the stereotype of the cut-throat, egotistical, self-centered New Yorker by doing FAVORS for friends, family and strangers in April, 2013.</p>
<p>But you do not have to be in Queens to do FAVORS! Anyone, anywhere can do a favor and get on the Map of FAVORS in April.</p>
<p>I’ll be working with at least SEVEN different community and arts organizations and anyone else who would like to be part of the project. So far our community partners are LaGuardia Performing Arts Center, Long Island City Artists, Jackson Heights Green Alliance,  Sunnyside Community Services, and Flushing High School, Rockaways Waterfront Alliance and the Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning.</p>
<p>All these groups do great work in their communities and we’re really looking forward to doing FAVORS with them. We are open to working with more partner organizations in Queens, if you know of any!</p>
<p>But even if you’re not affiliated with these organizations, you can still participate in FAVORS! This is a work of art that we are all creating together.</p>
<h3>Why FAVORS Needs Your Help and What You'll Get</h3>
<p>I’m happy to say that we’ve been funded in part by the Queens Council on the Arts (thank you QCA!). But our project budget is $7,100 and I still need $4,850.</p>
<p>We need funds for advertising, for outreach, for publicity, for printing, for insurance, for a videographer, a photographer, and more.  It’s a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>The good news is you can do favors for FAVORS by donating to the project right here through Indiegogo. Your contribution to the project is tax deductible through my fiscal sponsor Fractured Atlas.</p>
<p>And even though you may be doing this out of complete generosity, like a true favor,  we will give you something in return. Please see the perk list to the right for the FAVORS stuff you can get.</p>
<h3>You're Invited to Participate in FAVORS!</h3>
<p>Even if you aren’t able to help FAVORS financially at this time, you can still do us a favor by spreading the word about FAVORS or by coming to Queens and doing someone a favor! Or if you can't make to Queens, do someone a favor wherever you are and let us know about it. </p>
<p>This is a work of art that we are all creating together.</p>
<p>If you can’t make it to Queens you can still be part of FAVORS. In April just let us about your favor: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FAVORS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/FAVORS</a> or email: <a href=""mailto:doingFAVORS@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">doingFAVORS@gmail.com</a> or twitter: @doingFAVORS . And if none of those work for you send me a postcard at: Priscilla Studio, 44-02 23<sup>rd</sup> St, Long Island City, NY 11101.</p>
<h3>What Kind of FAVOR Do You Mean?</h3>
<p>If you’re not sure what kind of favor to do, you can check out our website: <a href=""http://favorscommunity.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://favorscommunity.wordpress.com</a> where there will be a list of FAVORS offered by people who want to do them. Or you can offer to do someone else a favor there. </p>
<p>FAVORS should take less than three hours including transportation time. It should not involve money or any type of coercion, and it has to be legal, of course! Also please keep in mind there will be kids involved in the project.</p>
<p>Once you let us know about the favor(s) you did, we’ll add it to the Map of FAVORS on google, which will show where all of our FAVORS are being done. Which brings me to Part 2 of FAVORS: the installation.</p>
<h3>The Map of FAVORS Installation</h3>
<p>The installation is an interactive sculpture that you can walk through and read. It will be made from hanging paper spirals, each with a favor someone did written on it. It will be based on the Map of FAVORS!</p>
<p>At the installation we’ll also have events, including a theater piece created by LaGuardia Performing Arts Center, one of our community partners. And we’ll have an artists’ talk and a group discussion with FAVORS participants and a panel to discuss issues related to doing FAVORS.</p>
<p>For example, when do you decide not to do a favor? Or is your culture or cultures that you’re familiar with actually based on doing favors? Or have you ever been politically pressured to do favors? Whatever topics come up in the process of doing FAVORS we will have space to discuss them in events at the installation.</p>
<h3>So Are We Ready to do FAVORS in April?</h3>
<p>Yes! Here are just a few of the FAVORS people are planning to do.</p>
<p>Michael is going to babysit for his friend’s baby!</p>
<p>Sada is going to buy some clothes for her brother’s family and send it to them in her country, Bangladesh!</p>
<p>Marcus is going to give his friend singing lessons!</p>
<h3>By Supporting FAVORS...</h3>
<p>You’ll help create massive goodwill!</p>
<p>You’ll help disprove the myth of the cut-throat, egotistical, self-centered New Yorker!</p>
<p>You’ll get a tax deduction for your charitable donation!</p>
<p>You’ll get cool FAVORS stuff!</p>
<p>You’ll help people explore what FAVORFS mean in different cultural, political and emotional contexts!</p>
<p>You’ll receive our genuine, heartfelt gratitude!</p>
<p>You’ll be doing FAVORS a favor!</p>
<p>And most of all you’ll help make FAVORS happen in Queens – and anywhere anyone does someone a favor!</p>
<h3>Cassy’s Words of Wisdom</h3>
<p>Listen to Cassy. She says doing favors for people should make you feel good, and you should not expect monetary return or any type of material benefit from it. Cassy thinks FAVORS is a great idea, and she wants to see what’s going to happen with the project!</p>
<p>So do we, and we hope you do, too. We hope you'll both support the project and join us in doing FAVORS!</p>

</p><p>Hi!
 I am Kelsey Maloney.  I grew up
among the lakes, meadows, and forests of South Lake Tahoe, California.  I
am 5’9 ½” tall.  I am a daughter, a sister, an aunt.  I am playful,
sincere, contemplative.  I dance.  I write.  I adventure. 
I love birds, moss, and ice-cream.  I love big thunderstorms, cold water
swimming, and letters in the mail.  I
don’t love ham, ticking clocks, or shopping malls.  I do love Australia.</p>
<p>Australia!
  In February 2014, I am going to Australia for 9 to 12 months.  I am
fundraising for a 5-month portion of my trip: 
an artistic journey into the Northern reaches of the country. </p>
<p>Why am I
going to northern Australia?   To study and draw birds and write stories about birds (and many other creatures too)!  They are heartmonster stories. We all have a heartmonster.  He lives inside our chests and attends to our truest of hearts.  He is a best friend, a protector, a truth keeper.  My hope is to take the drawings and stories I write in Australia, along with other pieces already written, and make a children’s storybook for all ages.   Please check out the pictures in the ""gallery"" to see heartmonster drawings and a sampling of bird life in Australia.</p><p>Why am I going to northern Australia?  Because I love it there and it
feels like home.  When I traveled to Australia in 2009 for one year, I
spent several months in Western Australia.  On a road trip up north with a
dear friend, we stopped at a national park in the Pilbarra region for several
days.  The land was rich with pokey grasses, massive gorges, red rocks,
and a scattering of gum trees.  At this place, on this land, I felt all
through my body ‘I AM HOME.  I’VE COME HOME.’  I’d never experienced
something like that in regards to a place before.  So clear and embodied.  </p>
<p>I am
raising money so I can have my basic needs covered, allowing me to focus
primarily on my art.  By contributing to my campaign, you will help me
access the remote, bird rich areas that I plan to go to.  All funds raised
will go specifically towards my 5-month creative journey in the north.  I
am funding the other 4+ months of my trip independently.</p>

<p><strong> </strong>Are you crazy about all things cars? Perhaps you have a favorite from your childhood, or that one vehicle that you always wanted but could never afford. Maybe it was that first set of wheels and the first feelings of freedom that you want to live again. Well if any of the above describes you, welcome to AutoMania.</p>
<p>My name is Ken Chester Jr. and for the last 20 years I have been writing new vehicle reviews for major newspapers across the United States.  For the last 12 years I have been taking thousands of pictures of the vehicles I have reviewed for my newspaper column.  In addition, I have attended the major car shows around the United States – taking pictures of the unique and unusual vehicles that have been displayed.  Starting in 2007, I have also included automotive images that I have taken for the inventory of my online stores. I now want to share these with other automaniacs like me.</p>
<p>From these tens of thousands of automotive images I am building a place to allow the car crazies of the world to access, search and download images of the vehicles many have just dreamed about – production, concept, and specialty images – that you will NOT find anywhere else on the Internet!</p>
<p>If that’s not enough, I will provide you the tools to enable you to manage the many images you are going to want – designed to be right sized for ANY computer or mobile device you choose.</p>
<p>More you say?  OK – Since I still shoot upto 1,000 images a month of the best and newest vehicles in the marketplace, you can also choose to sign up to be notified when I upload new content (which is almost weekly).</p>
<p><strong>W</strong><strong>hat We Need </strong></p>
<p>            This project will create a searchable and downloadable database of over 60,000 images – complete with the image management tools built in.   Because I own the images, there will be no restrictions what so ever in their use.   To achieve this goal I need to raise $49,745. </p>
<p><strong>The major expenses for this project are as follows:</strong></p>
<p>Programming                       $25,000</p>
<p>Marketing &amp; Advertising         $15,000</p>
<p>Fees &amp; Perks                        $ 5,600</p>
<p>General &amp; Administrative        $ 4,145</p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
<p>This searchable and downloadable database of automotive images is just the first product in what will become an auto-centric on-line community of all things automotive.  Streaming video, audio, clubs and associations will all become part of an amazing concept called “AutoManiaCity”.</p>
<p>The eventual goal will be to have AutoManiaCity be THE place for ALL things automotive – not just images alone.  But even a city has to be carved out of the wilderness.. and settled.  This is where you come in.  By helping us to create this product, it gives us the capital to then fund the development of AutoManiaCity.</p>

<h2>What is Wonderground Arts?</h2>
Wonderground Arts is an umbrella for mural work, stage/movie prop creation, and most importantly, the hand-crafted, travel-inspired clocks seen above! It is a colorful representation of happiness, beauty, and worldwide unity.</div>

<div>Jesse Pales, the owner / sole creator of Wonderground Arts, is a craftswoman, visual artist, and carpenter. Fueled by her interest in the arts, she takes design to a new level with the understanding that the prime focus of a piece is not just to make something ""look beautiful"", but also to infuse it with stunning visual appeal and passion. Dabbling the arts since the age of 5, she has decided to convert her hobbies into a fulfilling career. Jesse is also a mural artist, prop professional and graphic designer who has worked in carpentry and custom framing since age 16 and harnesses a grand set of artistic/ hardware tools and materials to boot.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The ultimate goal is to create ultra sensory gallery exhibits and take them all over the world.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Wrecked</span>
 is an idea.  One where the various talented artists in our local area 
can come together, share their passion for the arts and make new friends
 and colleagues.  We hope to elevate Central Florida’s talent pool 
through collaborative efforts.<br/><div style=""margin-left: 40px;""><br/></div>
We are two young professionals not far removed from being recent college
 graduates.  A Graphic Designer and a Filmmaker professionally.  A 
Renaissance Woman and a Storyteller naturally.  Together we are starting
 our own production company and working hard at breaking into the 
industry.  Slowly but steadily we are making a name for ourselves 
locally.  I still have to work another job to pay the bills currently, 
but we are on our way and doing just fine on our own.<br/><br/>
What we're here asking for help with is our event; <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Wrecked A Collision of Art.  </span>What started out  simply as a premiere my first short film, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Land of Nod</span>,
 has grown into an effort to strengthen our local art community in 
three ways.  First is to give other artists the ability to share their 
work instead of trying to showcase just 1 filmmaker.  Now we are 
presenting several of them, along with some fine artists, a photographer, performance 
artists, and a musician.  This pool of talent consists of artists 
ranging from student to seasoned professional.  Now, of course the show 
is open to the public, but we will be seeking the attendance of students from local art 
schools and local professionals to provide a networking atmosphere to
 connect the two.  Finally, a hope of ours is to get the varied artistic
 and creative communities to become more aware of each other.  We want 
to inspire some cross pollination of creative endeavors and local 
support.  Who knows what wonders and monstrosities could be created?  <br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>Aside from the aforementioned effects on the local art community.  We have partnered with Creative Clay.  If you haven't watched the video above I would recommend doing so.  I'm gonna let them speak for themselves through their mission statement here and the video you see above.<br/><br/>""<span class=""body"">Creative Clay’s mission is to make the arts 
accessible for every interested member of the Tampa Bay community 
regardless of age, gender, ability and/or race. Since 1995, Creative 
Clay has been providing local artists with developmental, physical 
and/or emotional disabilities an opportunity to pursue their passion for
 art making. Our arts programs consist of studio and community based 
activities for exploring unique personal realities in an inventive, 
professional environment. </span>
    Creative Clay is committed to promoting the work 
created by its member artists through bimonthly art exhibitions in our 
downtown gallery and various public venues throughout the greater Tampa 
Bay region.""  <br/><br/>We have offered ourselves up as one of these venues.  Along with the artists gathered we will be displaying art from Creative Clay members.  We are hoping to raise money for Creative Clay as well through various methods through out the event.  Some art has been donated so we may have a silent auction for the work leading up to the event.  The day of there will be a raffle for products and services donated by local businesses, professionals, artisans and vendors.  We are seeking out sponsorships for advertising space as well.  We would like to be able to donate all this along with ticket sales to Creative Clay.  <br/><br/>The money raised for Creative Clay will be an invaluable asset to them.  They will use it for any number of necessities such as art supplies for their members to updating their gallery which in need of repair.  That will include getting them up the ADA standards.  As it stands right now they have doors that are very difficult to operate for many of their members.<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>
<p>Overhead, that's what we are looking for help with.  There is work to make this event happen and a lot of out of pocket money that we can't necessarily afford to put out there.  We have been finding ways including (but not limited to) begging, pleading, borrowing and bartering.  And thanks to several kind hearted and like minded sponsors we have been able to get some of the necessities for reduced costs.  Here is a list of things that need to be covered.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"">Location</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> $800 </span>- Definitely a big deal and a must have.  Studio @620 In St. Petersburg Florida has secured the date of Saturday July 30th, 2011 for the show and has given us the week prior to showcase the artwork in their gallery.  They have the space we need, the projection equipment to show the films, the hanging system for the artwork and are providing a cash bar.  In our search to find a location we were met with prices ranging from no less than $3000 and upwards of $9000.  Studio @620 has a much more reasonable rate of $800 to use their space and are a big part of the local community.  We are very happy that they are on board with this project.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"">T-Shirts</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> $400-800</span> - Studio @620 can hold around 170 people when factoring in the seating for the film portion of the show.  We don't expect every patron to buy a shirt but we do need to have a variety of sizes for both men and women.  Our research has brought us to around $300-400 for 100 shirts.  If you look to the right you'll see that shirts are a part of the perks for donating to the campaign so we have to factor in you guys as well.  Either way there is a possibility of needing almost 200 shirts.  We are in talks with a local vendor who may be willing to do them at cost allowing us more profit from each shirt which will go to Creative Clay.  Nothing is finalized though so we will update as that info becomes available.<br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"">Marketing</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> $1000</span> - This is also very important.  Without effective marketing we can't get people in the door.  There are many things that need to be designed and printed such as: event programs, flyers, posters, post cards, mailers and so on.  Thankfully we have a few graphic designers on our team so no charge for that part, but the printing is where the money comes in.  And we did shoot a 3 minute short to help promote the show virally through the social media and the internet.  Thankfully we got some great actors who were willing to help our cause for free and Larry at Production Services and Systems helped us out on some equipment as well as a location.  But there were still some expenses involved to complete the production.<br/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"">Performers</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> $250</span> - Our musician and dancers are doing their thing for free and are local to Florida, but not the Tampa bay area.  We need to help them cover their travel expenses like gas and possibly room and board.  We have some people that may be able to provide a place to stay for them, but again, it's not finalized so we can't count on it just yet.  Will update as time goes on.fd</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Wrecked
 is an idea.  One where the various talented artists in our local area 
can come together, share their passion for the arts and make new friends
 and colleagues.  We hope to elevate Central Florida’s talent pool 
through collaborative efforts.
We are two young professionals not far removed from being recent college
 graduates.  A Graphic Designer and a Filmmaker professionally.  A 
Renaissance Woman and a Storyteller naturally.  Together we are starting
 our own production company and working hard at breaking into the 
industry.  Slowly but steadily we are making a name for ourselves 
locally.  I still have to work another job to pay the bills currently, 
but we are on our way and doing just fine on our own.
What we're here asking for help with is our event; Wrecked A Collision of Art.  What started out  simply as a premiere my first short film, Land of Nod,
 has grown into an effort to strengthen our local art community in 
three ways.  First is to give other artists the ability to share their 
work instead of trying to showcase just 1 filmmaker.  Now we are 
presenting several of them, along with some fine artists, a photographer, performance 
artists, and a musician.  This pool of talent consists of artists 
ranging from student to seasoned professional.  Now, of course the show 
is open to the public, but we will be seeking the attendance of students from local art 
schools and local professionals to provide a networking atmosphere to
 connect the two.  Finally, a hope of ours is to get the varied artistic
 and creative communities to become more aware of each other.  We want 
to inspire some cross pollination of creative endeavors and local 
support.  Who knows what wonders and monstrosities could be created?  

The ImpactAside from the aforementioned effects on the local art community.  We have partnered with Creative Clay.  If you haven't watched the video above I would recommend doing so.  I'm gonna let them speak for themselves through their mission statement here and the video you see above.""Creative Clay’s mission is to make the arts 
accessible for every interested member of the Tampa Bay community 
regardless of age, gender, ability and/or race. Since 1995, Creative 
Clay has been providing local artists with developmental, physical 
and/or emotional disabilities an opportunity to pursue their passion for
 art making. Our arts programs consist of studio and community based 
activities for exploring unique personal realities in an inventive, 
professional environment. 
    Creative Clay is committed to promoting the work 
created by its member artists through bimonthly art exhibitions in our 
downtown gallery and various public venues throughout the greater Tampa 
Bay region.""  We have offered ourselves up as one of these venues.  Along with the artists gathered we will be displaying art from Creative Clay members.  We are hoping to raise money for Creative Clay as well through various methods through out the event.  Some art has been donated so we may have a silent auction for the work leading up to the event.  The day of there will be a raffle for products and services donated by local businesses, professionals, artisans and vendors.  We are seeking out sponsorships for advertising space as well.  We would like to be able to donate all this along with ticket sales to Creative Clay.  The money raised for Creative Clay will be an invaluable asset to them.  They will use it for any number of necessities such as art supplies for their members to updating their gallery which in need of repair.  That will include getting them up the ADA standards.  As it stands right now they have doors that are very difficult to operate for many of their members.

What We Need 

Overhead, that's what we are looking for help with.  There is work to make this event happen and a lot of out of pocket money that we can't necessarily afford to put out there.  We have been finding ways including (but not limited to) begging, pleading, borrowing and bartering.  And thanks to several kind hearted and like minded sponsors we have been able to get some of the necessities for reduced costs.  Here is a list of things that need to be covered.

Location $800 - Definitely a big deal and a must have.  Studio @620 In St. Petersburg Florida has secured the date of Saturday July 30th, 2011 for the show and has given us the week prior to showcase the artwork in their gallery.  They have the space we need, the projection equipment to show the films, the hanging system for the artwork and are providing a cash bar.  In our search to find a location we were met with prices ranging from no less than $3000 and upwards of $9000.  Studio @620 has a much more reasonable rate of $800 to use their space and are a big part of the local community.  We are very happy that they are on board with this project.

T-Shirts $400-800 - Studio @620 can hold around 170 people when factoring in the seating for the film portion of the show.  We don't expect every patron to buy a shirt but we do need to have a variety of sizes for both men and women.  Our research has brought us to around $300-400 for 100 shirts.  If you look to the right you'll see that shirts are a part of the perks for donating to the campaign so we have to factor in you guys as well.  Either way there is a possibility of needing almost 200 shirts.  We are in talks with a local vendor who may be willing to do them at cost allowing us more profit from each shirt which will go to Creative Clay.  Nothing is finalized though so we will update as that info becomes available.

Marketing $1000 - This is also very important.  Without effective marketing we can't get people in the door.  There are many things that need to be designed and printed such as: event programs, flyers, posters, post cards, mailers and so on.  Thankfully we have a few graphic designers on our team so no charge for that part, but the printing is where the money comes in.  And we did shoot a 3 minute short to help promote the show virally through the social media and the internet.  Thankfully we got some great actors who were willing to help our cause for free and Larry at Production Services and Systems helped us out on some equipment as well as a location.  But there were still some expenses involved to complete the production.

Performers $250 - Our musician and dancers are doing their thing for free and are local to Florida, but not the Tampa bay area.  We need to help them cover their travel expenses like gas and possibly room and board.  We have some people that may be able to provide a place to stay for them, but again, it's not finalized so we can't count on it just yet.  Will update as time goes on.fd

TOTAL (estimated) - $2850
I know that we aren't asking for that total amount estimated above.  But we have been very lucky so far on finding some helpful, motivated and like minded people to help us out.  We believe that will continue and that we can do it for less than $2850.  So we are only seeking $2500 here.  Our hope is to cover enough of these operating costs so that we can donate as much as possible to Creative Clay.  If for some reason we don't reach this goal, the show will still go on, it will just come down to how much we can help Creative Clay without putting ourselves in the hole.If we exceed our goal, then every dollar over what we pay out will go to Creative Clay.  We are not taking any profit for ourselves from this campaign or event.  Monetary profit is not the point.  Helping our community in as many ways possible, is.  I hope you feel the same and can find it in within yourself and your budget to donate to this campaign.  Every dollar helps.
What You GetYou will definitely feel a sense of pride in yourself and your community for helping this campaign along.  But if that isn't enough for you, we are offering a range of perks with various donation amounts listed to the right.  You'll notive the titles are related to a ""Detective"" kind of vibe.  This is because we have chosen a Film Noire as the theme for the show.  That theme doesn't dictate what the artwork or films consists of, but simply our method of getting attention.  Why you may ask?  Well in the spirit of artistic freedom that Wrecked stands for, because we felt like it.  And as a filmmaker myself, it was a style I had not yet done.  So I took the opportunity to try something I had never done before.  You'll find the link to the promotional video here soon.  I hope you like it.

<p><b>Who We Are </b></p>
<p>Since 1996,
the Neon Museum has been dedicated to collecting, preserving, studying and
exhibiting iconic Las Vegas signs for educational, historical, arts and
cultural enrichment. Where possible, we fully restore select signage in order
to preserve the beauty of the signs and their message, as well as reintegrate
the signage into the community. Full sign restoration involves replacing broken
bulbs and neon, updating electrical, and repainting the sign cabinet. Many of our
restored signs have been installed throughout the city, as public art or as
part of the museum’s Neon Boneyard exhibition. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437496898/yrap8swkaz5pwrlutarx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need</b><br/></p>
<p><i>For the very first time</i>, the Neon Museum is

</div><div>
<p>Neon signage
is very fragile. Neon tubing breaks, paint flakes and fades, metal bends, and
the message gets lost. Iconic signs that have distinct shapes or features often
escape obscurity because they are easily recognizable. However, when a
simplified shape like the large rectangular cabinet of the Desert Rose Motel
loses its paint and tubing, the entire sign disappears. Like a massive canvas,
the Desert Rose is distinctive for its striking hand-painted lettering and
floral trellis detailing that makes the daytime visual experience as beautiful
as the night. The Desert Rose sign must be repainted in order to preserve these
one-of-a-kind design elements so that visitors to the Neon Museum will be able
to appreciate its beauty and historical significance for many years to come.</p>
<p>Designed by the Young Electric Sign Company,
the large pole-mounted sign was originally situated on the southern end of the
Las Vegas Strip, drawing in visitors traveling into the city along Highway 91
from Los Angeles. The Desert Rose Motel opened in 1953 and remained in
operation until 1995 when the building was demolished to make way for the Monte
Carlo. The bright blue billboard with trailing flowers was a fixture of the
vintage Las Vegas skyline. </p>
<p>Contributing to the Desert Rose Motel sign
campaign will put you at the forefront of sign conservation. Your contribution
will help the museum start the next phase of its mission and allow museum
visitors to better appreciate the art form that is the sign. <i>You will be

This includes Custom Duties and Taxes. 3D printing the smaller versions of the Rygo, the Leafychain, the Rochain or the Niche are a significant expense that must be covered. If we don't meet our target, we can print a smaller Rygo. But size matters! I don't think a smaller Statue of Liberty would have had the same impact as it did. Nor a smaller Eiffel Tower. And it certainly wouldn't be ""the largest"" 3D print in North America. The DShape is a 6 x 6 x 8 meter 3D printer.... so if we exceed our target, we might print a bigger Rygo!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian form of martial art/dance engaged in at clubs, schools and on the streets. A sport involving intense physical training, it incorporates music, dance and combative movements, fascinating in beauty and form. The game takes place in a <em>roda</em> (circle) formed by the students and involves two players who try to outwit each other through a physical dialog using a combination of kicks, takedowns, escapes and acrobatics, which are wonderfully fluid in appearance.</p>
<p>There are no hard and fast rules, yet capoeira does follow a characteristic protocol, along with having its own music – perhaps its most enduring feature. Through learning the songs of capoeira, students also gain access to learning a new language (Portuguese), instruments and Brazilian history. By binding together these elements of sport, music, dance, martial skills and camaraderie, capoeira comprises one of the richest manifestations of Brazilian culture.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 WHO ARE WE?</strong></p>
<p>We are the Westchester County chapter of the capoeira group Cordão de Ouro. Professor Cabeção, who has been practicing for 16 years under the supervision of Mestre Esquilo, has been offering classes in Tarrytown and Ossining since January 2012. This will be the first batizado for Professor Cabeção’s group in the area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. WHAT IS A BATIZADO?</strong></p>
<p>A capoeira batizado is an event that brings capoeiristas from all over the world together with other athletes, fans of sports, art and music, along with friends and family of the local group members to participate in and enjoy workshops, performances and celebrations organized with the intention of promoting capoeira, as well as all elements of music, culture, health, dance and the arts in the area. The purpose of the batizado ceremony is to deliver the first cord (the equivalent of a belt in other martial arts) to the students of the local group. In order to perform this ceremony, the presence of a capoeira Mestre is essential. Numerous capoeira professionals are called to assist in the organization of the ceremony (to play instruments, sing, graduate the students, etc.). The students are involved not only in promoting capoeira and demonstrating what they have learned over the course of their training for the capoeira community, friends and family, but also in elevating the name and image of the city and surrounding areas through capoeira. We also see this event as an opportunity to stimulate activity in the area and bring residents more art, culture, entertainment, health, music and everything associated with capoeira. With each event we grow, both individually and as a group, and improve the quality of our own capoeira and the quality of our local capoeira group.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4. OBJECTIVE</strong></p>
<p>We are promoting an event with our students in order to celebrate our work in the area and to bring capoeira practitioners, friends, family and the public to join us in celebration, to enjoy entertainment and culture, and to share our enthusiasm for our existence as a group. We intend to publicize our work related to capoeira, culture, education, and health, along with the work of others in the area who share these values. We are working to bring two people who are recognized and valued in the capoeira community for their importance and talent, in order to enhance the event and attract more practitioners and the community to come to learn more about capoeira, participate in the proposed activities, and ultimately to mobilize more people and to bring an exceptional quality to the information and activities to be presented at the event.</p>
<p>Please contact us if you would like more information regarding our proposal to bring Contra-Mestre Eurico. Eurico Vianna is working on a PhD in Sociology at Griffith University in Australia and has been a junior level master of capoeira since 2004. Throughout his career in capoeira and his academic studies he has given numerous lectures, written articles and a book, participated in documentaries and international projects involving the use of capoeira as a tool for social inclusion. He would like to come to help us with our event, and has offered to give lectures or workshops at other locations in the area to cover his travel expenses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5. JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p>This event is essential in order to reward the efforts of the students who have been training and preparing to graduate, and through a great ceremony or event, to celebrate while bringing different activities such as capoeira to the area. The event will encourage others in the area with similar work and ideals to come together, and magnify the name and image of the city and locale through capoeira, thus allowing us to develop resources that will aid in our growth, to satisfy the public, and to always be able to bring entertainment, culture, art, health and quality to the area, and to be able to disseminate and develop projects here similar to various projects that already exist in Brazil.</p>
<p> </p>

Huddersfield, 36 miles from Manchester, 163 miles from London, up a bit and
just to the right and inevitably 24 hours from Tulsa. . . we are taking our degree show to ‘that London’ – (Free

<p>Our exhibition entitled 'Closer' (closer
to professional life, closer to London, closer to achieving our aspirations)
spans a range of visual outcomes including printmaking, illustration, sculpture,

Short Summary

Life Cyrcle is a 30 meter wide light art installation @ Midburn 2015  which deals with the motion of time, through static elements and light.

Midburn is the Middle East Regional Burningman event.





The philosophy


The Life Cycle will deal with the cyclicality and circularity of life. The installation will graphically demonstrate the movement of time with repetitive static elements spread on the playa. And will give you the sensation that everything is cyclic and all current states are temporarily.
The main Ingredient in our installation is light. Light is always all around us, like the clock's hands circling the watch. Projecting light through the static elements we are awaking them and make them dynamic. What that will create is the sense of motion and cyclicality.


                                 
The installation could be experienced from various points of view. You can be a bystander outside of the circle, with a partial point of view. Or stand in the center of the circle, where the viewer can follow the motion of the installation with his body and sight. Having a continuous and 360 degree point of view would give the sensation of the circular cyclicality and would make the viewer feel as one with the installation.

How are we going to do it

We will arrange 36 cubes in 2.6 meter intervals arranged on a 30 meter diameter circle. The cubes will be illuminated in various bright lights, according to the light sequences generated by our computer, creating a movement and time sense of feeling. 
We wanted to use an industrial product, that would be cut off from the environmental context of the desert, and would be made of material that interacts with light. This is how we got to the 1000 L liquid cubes.
The cubes are arranged in a circle, each one shifted 40 degrees from the other, the minimal shift needed to create the appearance of smooth motion as the light travels through. 

In each cube, installed a RGB LED light fixture, controlled by a computer. Each light fixture is installed to the bottom of the cube perpendicularly, lighting the head of the cube, in each position. From each cube, the light is spread in different angles, emphasizing the virtual movement of the cube. 


Our installation requirements:

2  semi trailer trucks  for transportation
36  Plastic Cubes 1m X 1m X 1.2m
36 RGB Led light fixtures 150W each (total of 5400 Watts!!!!)
120 meters of tunel diging
120 meters DMX comunication cables
120 meters electricity cables
1 main light computer
140 meter of iron construction profiles.
144 iron pegs.
9 crew members

We’ve done the first test of it – It’s F*$@ing crazy and awesome:

What do we need from you !?

What do we need?
That form of energy that is referred to when trying to transact goods – money :)
 not so much, but still...
The total cost of all the electronics, material, instruments and the transportation of all of it on 2 full semi-trailer trucks, into the desert and back, is $14,000 .We raised already 5,000 $USD before this campaign.
We need 9,000 more.

As part of the community of Burningman, we thank you for your support. And if you are short with cash in the point this finds you, we completely understand – please donate by sharing and tagging on FB, forwarding in emails or just giving us a good ‘god speed’ blessing :)

<h3>Rebuild the Mirage</h3>
<p>The Mirage is a Mutant Vehicle (Art Car) that was built for Burning Man 2012 by myself (Wisey) and a small team of volunteers.</p>
<p>I am an engineer and an artist and I have built art cars for Burning Man each year for the last 5 years. Lots of people have had lots of fun on these vehicles. </p>
<p>The car is made to be almost invisible from the outside as its surface is constructed from 2-way surveilance mirror. As a result the desert is reflected off the bottom and the sky is reflected off the top and the car becomes like a mirage.</p>
<p>From the inside the playa is fully visible through the 2 way mirror. Those inside can see out but those outside cannot see in.</p>
<p>The inside of the Mirage is covered in memory foam and white fur to make it soft and cuddly wherever you decide to lean.</p>
<p>The top deck of the Mirage features a comfortable lounge area as well as a bar and a DJ booth. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there was a storm in Reno in December 2012 that was more powerful than any other in the last 20 years. 120mph winds ripped all of the mirrors from the frame of the Mirage and smashed them all over the floor. The car was luckily parked above the level of the flooding and was safe from water damage. All the LED parcans and other lighting for the vehicle however were stored in the barn and did not fare quite as well. </p>
<p>We now need to purchase a whole new set of mirrors to rebuild the mirage as well as new lights to illuminate it at night time on the dark playa. The mirrors were unfortunately, the most expensive part of the build.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will make sure that the Mirage makes it to Burning Man 2013 for a whole new group of burners to experience the joys of riding an art car.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute financially to the project, please share this campaign with others who can. </p>
<p>If you will be in Reno in the week before Burning Man 2013, we need extra hands to help us fit the new mirrors and lights and pick up all the pieces of smashed mirror that are left after the storm.</p>

<p>In 1956, almost a year after Disneyland opened, Storybook Land began taking visitors through its gateway to enchantment and past miniature scenes from many classic Disney films.  After years of being exposed the elements, many of the original buildings were replaced with exact duplicates, but constructed with more modern and durable materials.  One particular set of buildings, the ""French Village"" that sat just below Cinderella's pink and gold castle, was saved and eventually donated to the Carolwood Foundation.  At 57 years old, the village today is nearly unsalvageable, but it still retains so much amazing detail that it begs to be restored as a piece of Walt Disney's history and a tribute to his love of miniatures.</p>
<p>The Carolwood Foundation is now embarking on this careful restoration, preserving as much of the wood structure as possible and rebuilding new sections that have been destroyed or have gone missing altogether.  Once completed, the village will become an entirely new exhibit at Walt's Barn in Griffith Park, entitled ""The Small Worlds of Walt.""  The exhibit will educate visitors about scale models and explore the different miniatures, large and small, that Walt wanted to put into his park.  Whether its Main Street, Sleeping Beauty Castle, The Disneyland Railroad, Storybook Land or the Carolwood Barn, they are all The Small Worlds of Walt.</p>
<p>The Carolwood Foundation needs your help to bring these beloved miniatures back to life.  Our hope is that the Disney fan community can come together to fund the restoration and the construction of the exhibit so that these priceless pieces of history can be enjoyed up close for generations to come.  </p>
<p>Please visit <a href=""http://www.smallworldsofwalt.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.smallworldsofwalt.com</a> to see the progress of the restoration and find out how you can help become a part of this important endeavor.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds raised will be going first to purchase supplies needed to preserve and restore the village, then towards building the ""Small Worlds of Walt"" exhibit wagon so that the Storybook Land village can be put on display for visitors to Walt's Barn to enjoy for years.  Any extra funds raised will go towards a new on-site storage building for the exhibit wagon as well and towards bringing the exhibit on the road to future fan conventions and expos.</p>
<p>Our fundraising milestones are broken down like this:</p>
<p>$4000 completes the restoration</p>
<p>$6000 completes the mobile display for expos and conventions</p>
<p>$9000 completes the ""Small Worlds of Walt"" exhibit wagon for outdoor protection.</p>
<p>$9000+ contributes to the building of an on-site storage building at Walt's Barn</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you feel just as strongly about preserving the history of Walt Disney, the history of Disneyland and the history of imagineering then we would greatly appreciate your help.  The Carolwood Foundation is in no way associated with the Walt Disney Company and we operate completely through the dedication and hard work of volunteers.  Preservation and educating the puplic about Walt's personal passions of railroading and miniatures give people a new perspective on the theme parks that people know and love.  We take up this responsiblity with great pleasure knowing that these historic pieces will continue to delight, educate and enchant generations to come.</p>

<li>Help me reunite <strong>the </strong><strong>original willyCat</strong> with his long lost Ellen.</li>

<p>I have always wanted to be an entrepreneur ... that is, other than a starving artist ... I also have a strong passion for comedy ... and really enjoy making people laugh and smile.</p>

<p>Through my long hours of research … I discovered there were dozens of places and several levels of quality I could produce <strong>willyCat</strong> at, however, one very important factor, other than his environmental footprint … I want <strong>willyCat</strong> to outlive everyone who owns him.</p>
<p>You may be thinking about the plastic bottles, and wonder ... is <strong>willyCat</strong> safe and soft enough for infants? ... you bet he is ... even the pictures do not show how amazing <strong>willyCat</strong> actually is ... the vision for <strong>willyCat</strong>, is for him to be every child's absolute favourite ... <strong>willyCat</strong> was created to be very loveable ... his cuteness ... that just happened.</p>
<p>The colour of <strong>willyCat</strong> is brownish with beige paws ... I designed him with these colours for a reason ... when <strong>willyCat</strong> is in his senior years ... he will, pretty much look the same colour.</p>

<h3>SEND ME TO VIENNA</h3>
<p>Hi Everybodee,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Mica Sigourney/VivvyAnne ForeverMORE! For those of you that don't know me I am a performer, Drag Queen and choreographer living in San Francisco California. I've been making performance in the Bay Area for 5 years, and been getting up on stage for 28 years (since I was five). To get more familiar you can read what the Bay Guardian recently wrote about me when I won a Local Discovery Award for Performance here: <a href=""http://www.sfbg.com/2012/11/13/goldies-2012-mica-sigourney"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sfbg.com/2012/11/13/goldies-2012-mica-sigourney</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have the honor of being accepted to DanceWeb, the scholarship program at ImPulsTanz. Over 1,000 performers and dancers from around the world apply to DanceWeb every year, this year they accepted 66 folks and I'm one of them. I'll be participating in an international contemporary performance festival in July and August of 2013 in Vieanna Austria. It's a game changer in my arts and performance making: I'll have 5 weeks of intensive study, exchange of ideas with global artists and leaders, and 1 on 1 one coaching with this years mentor. </p>
<p>This oppurtunity comes at a time when I am seeking to really formalize the experiences I've had over the past 5 years in San Francisco's nightlife and drag scenes.  I had considered grad school but don't want to upset my life and my commitment to making happenings and performances for my community here in San Francisco. DanceWeb is the perfect oppurtunity to enrich my understanding and experiences of international contemporary performance while connecting with other artists and making inroads to oppurtunities abroad for me and  for the folks I work with here in San Francisco.</p>

<h3>WHAT I NEED TO GET THERE</h3>
<p>To get to DanceWeb I must complete 1/3 cost of tuition, buy a plane ticket, and feed myself while I'm there, plus miscellaneous costs.</p>
<p>Unlike European participants who get government funding<strong>, </strong>participants from America generally have to secure private donations from family, friends, and amazing supporters like<strong> you</strong>. </p>
<p>My goal is to raise money through grant applications, my own hard work and the squirreling away of pennies and dollars, and finally reaching out to my friends, family and community (and beyond) through indie-agogo. </p>
<p>My goal is to raise $4,700 through indie-agogo. This will cover tuition and most of my travel.</p>
<p>What you will get from participating is not only the knowledge that you are enhancing my education and experience, which allows me to make deeper, more exciting, nuanced and BETTERER performances for you, my audiences and communities, but also some special perks. </p>

<h3>A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>While I've touched on this briefly already I do believe sending me to DanceWeb will not just make me a happy art maker but will also enhance my community here in San Francisco. Those of you who know me know that I continually collaborate with those around me, my ongoing project Work MORE! annually pairs artists in new collaborations and comissions them to create new works (I've currently secured funds to make the next Work MORE! fully funded, and profitable for the artists). As a performer my work is very social, I rarely hole up in the studio alone, instead favoring large group rehearsals, orchestrating informal creative gatherings, and getting my stuff on stage in front of folks, sharing what i've made. </p>
<p>This is an awesome oppurtunity for me to take in a lot of information from a lot of sources I'd otherwise not have access to. I'm excited not just to go to Vienna but to come back and share what I've learned and gained with those around me. I'm not gonna sit here and pretend it's 100% altruistic, I think it's gonna be super fun and really eye opening. But my track record has proven that I'm pretty social and really want to share with my community.</p>

Hi Everybodee,
 
My name is Mica Sigourney/VivvyAnne ForeverMORE! For those of you that don't know me I am a performer, Drag Queen and choreographer living in San Francisco California. I've been making performance in the Bay Area for 5 years, and been getting up on stage for 28 years (since I was five). To get more familiar you can read what the Bay Guardian recently wrote about me when I won a Local Discovery Award for Performance here: http://www.sfbg.com/2012/11/13/goldies-2012-mica-sigourney
 
I have the honor of being accepted to DanceWeb, the scholarship program at ImPulsTanz. Over 1,000 performers and dancers from around the world apply to DanceWeb every year, this year they accepted 66 folks and I'm one of them. I'll be participating in an international contemporary performance festival in July and August of 2013 in Vieanna Austria. It's a game changer in my arts and performance making: I'll have 5 weeks of intensive study, exchange of ideas with global artists and leaders, and 1 on 1 one coaching with this years mentor.

<h3>Summary of this campaign</h3>
<p>I began covering the conflict in Ukraine's east after my longterm job/role was made redundant in 2015.</p>
<p>Since then I have made regular trips to Ukraine, kept in contact with friends, developed relationships with new sources, continued to share information, and met more people affected or touched by the war, both in Ukraine and Australia. I have made no profit from my work, and continue to do it because I feel it is important, and socially/historically valuable.</p>
<p>This IndieGogo campaign will help me raise funds to develop and realise an exhibition of photography and video captured in Ukraine. I unsuccessfully applied to exhibit at this gallery in 2016. A follow-up application was approved in 2017, and I now have the chance to present my work to people in Melbourne, Australia, and share the stories I've been trusted to tell. This is my first exhibition in a gallery environment.</p>

<h3>Outline the impact</h3>
<p>I believe my project is valuable, as the conflict in Ukraine is underreported around the world, especially in Australia.</p>
<p>27 Australian citizens were killed when MH17 was shot down near Hrabove in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. Australian news media lost interest in the overall ongoing situation after this. I feel I have stepped up to fill this void - or attempted to - however I know I am only one person, and I am doing what I can.</p>
<p>This exhibition is a direct opportunity to share work such as mine in Australia. This exhibition is the first of its kind in Melbourne, and I am unaware of any other exhibition/gallery in Australia that has presented work that solely focuses on the war in Ukraine, the impact of the war on Ukrainian citizens and military volunteers, and the ongoing humanitarian crisis as a result of the war.</p>
<p>Prior to this I have produced two short documentary films about the conflict, one of which a Melbourne-based media company assisted me in editing. My documentary was screened at a local cinema last year to over 200 people, alongside the work of Ukrainian-Australian Stefan Bugryn, who presented his debut documentary film 'War Mothers', which explored the stories of Ukrainian mothers whose sons had been killed in the war.</p>
<p>I will present large (24 x 36 "") colour prints, as well as many smaller prints of black-and-white film photographs. One wall will feature a 1 x 1 meter print from a medium-format negative, displayed in the Moreland Council's 2017 Summer Show, showing a Ukrainian veteran undergoing rehabilitation after being wounded in Ukraine's east. Another wall will display projected video of footage from civilian areas affected by the war and focuses on sound and atmosphere.</p>

<p>Any contribution you're able to make directly assists in generating discussion of this issue, and brings attention to the fact it is still happening, and remembers those who have lost their lives to the conflict. I believe that the exhibition will receive media coverage, further amplifying any donations made.</p>
<p>I have met with the large Ukrainian diaspora community in Melbourne and I know they desire coverage and news on the situation. By extension of this project being 'successful' I will be able to continue my work in the future.

</div><p>-</p><p><i>Every contribution helps in making my exhibition a reality. Thank you.</i></p></div>","Summary of this campaign
I began covering the conflict in Ukraine's east after my longterm job/role was made redundant in 2015.
Since then I have made regular trips to Ukraine, kept in contact with friends, developed relationships with new sources, continued to share information, and met more people affected or touched by the war, both in Ukraine and Australia. I have made no profit from my work, and continue to do it because I feel it is important, and socially/historically valuable.
This IndieGogo campaign will help me raise funds to develop and realise an exhibition of photography and video captured in Ukraine. I unsuccessfully applied to exhibit at this gallery in 2016. A follow-up application was approved in 2017, and I now have the chance to present my work to people in Melbourne, Australia, and share the stories I've been trusted to tell. This is my first exhibition in a gallery environment.
'Moreland City Council - Донбасс (Donbas): Photography from Ukraine’s war-torn east' 
The exhibition will hold an opening night on Friday 26th April, 2018, and run for one month, closing on the 27th of May, 2018. The work will appear as part of the 2018 Human Rights Arts & Film Festival. The Ukrainian Ambassador to Australia will be attending, and making an opening speech/remarks.
I will invite Ukrainian diaspora communities, and openly request anyone interested attend on the evening. I believe this exhibition, and my work, is a genuine opportunity to share an underreported global issue with the people of Melbourne, and Australia.

I hope to raise $1,000 AUD (maximum) to develop this exhibition. These funds will be used for printing and framing of photographs, and any other exhibition-related costs. I personally will pay the same amount as a fee for using the gallery space.
I have created this crowdfunding campaign to assist me in creating this exhibition, however I recognise it is my responsibility alone if it is not successful.

Outline the impact
I believe my project is valuable, as the conflict in Ukraine is underreported around the world, especially in Australia.
27 Australian citizens were killed when MH17 was shot down near Hrabove in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. Australian news media lost interest in the overall ongoing situation after this. I feel I have stepped up to fill this void - or attempted to - however I know I am only one person, and I am doing what I can.

Wear your tuxes and ball gowns - we'll have ball!We want to have some music, demonstrations of flame effects, and a fire show! However, to do this we need about $800 to cover event costs.Event details here:https://www.facebook.com/events/1021812744579205/In exchange for your support, we are going to cook up tasty food as a reward, as well as provide some Fire Ball theme buttons (pins).On the right, check out the campaign perks for the food we're offering!
Disclosure: about 50% of donation for food rewards will go back to the event. The rest covers the costs. We're hoping that each event attendee will make a minimum $5 donation straight into the event, either as $10 in food rewards or $5 straight up. 
If we get more than enough
Extra funds will go to support the artists who participate in this event!
The Impact
 This is an opportunity to get all our friends together at a fairly informal event where we can have fun and enjoy some fire. All it will take is a small donation from the people who are going to attend.Risks
  Regardless of whether this fundraiser is successful, we will still host this event. However, your contribution will ensure that Shannon and Ashes don't have to foot the bill!   Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  We are looking for volunteers to be in the fire show
We need help running the event, please sign up to help:http://tinyurl.com/fireballvolunteer

Leeds Young Authors (LYA) is a grassroots youth
organisation founded in 2003 in the socially deprived area of Chapeltown,
Leeds, UK.
LYA promotes active literacy, social, political and cultural awareness by
creating spaces to celebrate youth voices, and offers the opportunity for young
people to develop their artistic abilities as confident writers and live
performers across race, class, gender, culture and sexual orientation. 
 
In late July 2011 we hope
to represent Leeds and the UK
in the Brave New Voices (BNV)
International Poetry & Literature Festival – the largest youth event of its
kind this year held in San Francisco.
BNV offers an intensive programme of workshops, seminars and community building
activities and provides an invaluable learning experience for the young people,
poet coaches, educators and mentors alike. 
 
LYA first took part in BNV in 2004 (the first non-American group
invited to do so) and in 2009
our team placed second in the whole poetry Slam competition – an outstanding
achievement considering Leeds was then only one of three teams from outside the US.
 
Last year funding
cuts meant it was not possible for us to send a full team to BNV and the tragic
death of one of our 2009 team members also impacted the project. Despite these
challenges we are determined to continue nurturing the next generation
of poets and we have recently built upon our success at BNV 2009 by winning the
Word Cup UK National Slam Finals in
2010.


With your help we
are now hoping to raise enough money to cover the travel costs and festival
registration for our team to participate in BNV 2011 and to continue the
valuable process of cross-cultural international exchange.

<p>My name is Alvaro Pacheco and I am the agent of the painter Annie Sène. When Annie paints she goes into a trance. Her universe becomes timeless, and her body becomes discretely present.

<p>I would like to point out one of her most outstanding paintings.<b> “Beauty of Life, with no end”</b>.
“Beauty of Life, with no end” is not only the title of one of her paintings but it is also the philosophy that pervades her art. Everyday life is full of beauty. Suffices to keep your eyes open to see this beauty. And if perchance beauty fails to present itself before your eyes, you must create it. One must draw it out of oneself. One must re-create beauty from the rubble of reality.</p>

<p>In between two brush strokes, in between two respirations the clock does not tire itself. But after all the brush strokes that co-habit on a well filled-out painting the clock is left panting keeping up with the pace. In between two paintings there exists an unalterable bio-rythmn. The sun shines. The one in the sky. Not the one the painter feels and sees in her sate of trance. The clouds are in translucent movement. The birds fill the window sill of the studio. The artist realizes that she must feed herself otherwise her next painting will be quite meagre. The artist must also pay for her studio. Paintings do not tolerate nor snow nor rain.</p>

Elsődleges találkozási pont, közösségi tér, bulihelyszín ahol nem készülhet partyfotó,  a kedd reggeli hipószag.Egyet biztosan állíthatunk, hogy ez a PTE BTK-n évtizedek óta működő hivatalos bölcsész Klub.A mi helyünk. Otthon, odú, búvóhely.  
2013-as átalakítása óta azonban azt kell mondanunk, szeretett széntárolónk elég  lelketlen és üres. A gerendák lekerülésének tűzvédelmi és higiéniai oka senkit nem érdekel, mert a bordó-fekete komorság egyszerűen csak ronda.A mostani kampány célja, hogy kiszínezzük, élettel töltsük fel a Szenest.Alapvető ötletünk az, hogy Pécset az eddigiekben és jelenleg is meghatározó emblematikus embereket és épületeket stencilezünk a falra. Az arcképcsarnok folyamatosan bővülő és kiegészíthető, a kis karikatúrák pedig beengednek egy keveset a város pszeudomediterrán hangulatából, popkulturális múltjából és jelenéből a bányába.   Mire van szükségünk mindehhez? 
Ha nagyon mozgalmira vesszük, akkor azt mondjuk: szükségünk van Rád!Most azt gondolod, azt mondtuk: szükségünk van a pénzedre!Mindkettőben van igazság.Az arculati festéshez cirka 1000 eurónyi összeget (~ 300 000 forint) kell összekalapoznunk. Tartalmazza ez a festékek árát, a festőmanók munkadíját, a külső pavilon térkövezésének költségeit és a grafikák elkészítését. 
Felajánlásod azonban nem marad viszonzatlanul!Cserébe olyan különböző szupercsomagok közül választhatsz, amik minden kisbölcsész egyetemista szívét megdobogtatnák - matricacsomag az új dizájnnal, féléves Szenes támogatói bérlet, pizzakuponok, PécsiBölcsész címlap vagy az altamirai haverkákat messze lepipáló falfestmény-Szenes portré Rólad (vagy akiről csak szeretnéd).Ezek a csomagok különböző áron vehetők meg - és amellett hogy kúl cuccokhoz jutsz, minket is támogatsz. A felajánlott összeg a Klub üzemeltetőjének bankszámlájára kerül, ő kifizet mindenkit, ti pedig folyamatosan követhetitek, hogy áll a folyamat. Amennyiben nem jön össze a kellő összeg, elkezdjük a festési-felújítási munkánkat, csak lassabb ütemben - ameddig a takarónk ér.
    Hogy lehet mindez ennyire menő??! Ne feledd, adományozni szexi, és minél többet adsz, annál szexibb leszel. A Szenes is annál szexibb lesz.
Őszintén hiszünk a közösségi finanszírozás erejében, és hisszük azt, hogy nagyobb mosollyal jössz majd le hétfőnként azon a bizonyos lépcsőn abban a tudatban, hogy Te is hozzátettél egy (vagy több) vodkaszódányit.
Egy hónapja megkérdeztünk Titeket, kiket látnátok szívesen a falakon.A Ti szavazataitok alapján januárban felkerülhet Beck Zoli, a Fishing on Orfű szervezőcsapata, Bagi Zsolt jedi nagymester és a Kerényis padavanok, stb.Vagy sokkal jobb ötleted van?
Képzeld csak: olyan lesz, amilyennek szeretnéd.
A Szenes mi vagyunk.

</h3><p><b>ABOUT ME and MY BOOK</b></p>
<p>Hello.  My name is Richard Orton and I want to share
my remarkable photographic journey with you.</p>
<p>Years ago I became aware
of a world I did not know existed, and it captured my imagination.  I went down the rabbit hole!  I met some remarkable people there, and they
changed my life.  Had I not found this
world, much of what is now my life would not have been revealed to me. </p>
<p>A little over
twenty-five years ago I visited a small community in northwest Nacogdoches
County in deep East Texas.  That
community, known as County Line, began in the 1870’s when three former slaves,
the Upshaw brothers, Guss, Felix, and Jim, settled there. They and other newly
emancipated blacks moved there and raised families on land they owned, farmed,
and otherwise used to support themselves. They did this at a time when Jim Crow
ruled the lives of most blacks throughout the South.  Descendants of these pioneers still live in
County Line.  It is one of many similar
communities in East Texas and throughout the South.  Would you help me make this little known, but
important, part of American history more visible and appreciated?  Would you join my dream?</p>
<p>During the last twenty-five
years I have photographed daily life in County Line and learned a lot about its
history.  Now I am making a book
containing more than 50 duotone photographs and text from community members conveying the contemporary experience of
growing up in a “freedom colony.”  </p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED and WHAT YOU GET</b></p>
<p>It really helps that the
University of North Texas Press has already agreed to publish the book in the Fall of 2014!  Yes, really! 
</p>
<p>So why do I need your
support?  </p>
<p>Printing high quality
photographs, known as duotones, is more expensive than normal printing.  As an academic press, UNT Press has budgetary
limitations.  So they’ve asked me to
raise additional funds. That’s where you come in.  </p>
<p>I’m setting our goal at
$8,000.  </p>
<p>If you decide to help
me, you will be rewarded.  I’m offering
several exhibition quality prints from the book, a production credit printed in
the book, and, of course, a signed copy of the book itself.  See the “Perks” section for details.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Our American history
books have neglected the story of communities like County Line. Known as
“freedom colonies,” their importance in the lives of African-Americans after
slavery ended deserves to be better known. 
They provided opportunities for African-Americans to have better, more
independent lives than most other newly freed slaves.  Your contribution to my book will help
correct this mistake.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Even if you are not able
to contribute financially you can still help by getting the word out to people
you know who might be interested in contributing.  You can use the share tools located below the
video.</p></div>","ABOUT ME and MY BOOK

WHAT WE NEED and WHAT YOU GET
It really helps that the
University of North Texas Press has already agreed to publish the book in the Fall of 2014!  Yes, really! 

So why do I need your
support?  
Printing high quality
photographs, known as duotones, is more expensive than normal printing.  As an academic press, UNT Press has budgetary
limitations.  So they’ve asked me to
raise additional funds. That’s where you come in.  
I’m setting our goal at
$8,000.  
If you decide to help
me, you will be rewarded.  I’m offering
several exhibition quality prints from the book, a production credit printed in
the book, and, of course, a signed copy of the book itself.  See the “Perks” section for details.
The Impact
Our American history
books have neglected the story of communities like County Line. Known as
“freedom colonies,” their importance in the lives of African-Americans after
slavery ended deserves to be better known. 
They provided opportunities for African-Americans to have better, more
independent lives than most other newly freed slaves.  Your contribution to my book will help
correct this mistake.

<h3>Hello.....I'M ARTIST RICHARD ARTHUR!</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I am a California based artist who seeks to change the course of modern art.  It has been my fondest dream to create an artshow celebrating the great supermodels and be able to share the work with them.  On a recent trip to London, Kate Moss walked right up to me and asked me who I was.  When I said, ""The painter Richard Arthur..it's wonderful to meet you!"",  her eyes widened and she replied...""OH..<em>that</em> Richard!""  It was a very special moment. Once i got home to the US I knew I had to craft something...not just an artshow, but a new way of thinking about everything...I couldn't work in a boutique any longer, for now was the time to invent the dream and soar headlong into my true purpose. I created an artshow that I plan to debut during New York Fashion Week, and eventually go international beginning with London, then Paris and so on. The show will celebrate a new and unique beauty icon hand picked from the world of fashion and the event will take place annually.  I plan to paint Kate Moss, Lara Stone and Carmen Kass to name a few....Your contribution will help me to realize a stunning vision I dreamed up where large scale portraits will be adorned with neon tubing that is sure to light up a space in a remarkable and exciting way.....you have the chance to be part of Art History! </p>

<p>With the support of my supermodel friends, I plan to align each show with a charity of the choosing of each model.  The debut show will feature Carmen Kass and a portion of the profits recieved from the show will be donated to a charity of her choosing.

We also want to hire two editors to write industry related articles and to launch weekly and monthly challenges. We also want to hire an art moderator, to fight spam and better organize art visibility on the homepage.CG Hubs is an indie community of CG artists, designers and painters. It is not supposed to replace any other community, instead it offers an alternative. While the name is similar to another community, now closed, it is not meant to replace it or to copy it. Our community is built on open-source software and bespoke modules, uniquely built for our purposes.We worked for 3 months to build an easy to use system and to offer artists, designers and painters maximum exposure and visibility.The site is in beta state and it's available on http://cghubs.com/.How does it work?As an artist, you simply create a hub account and start uploading images. It's that simple. You have the possibility to enhance your profile and make it stand out from the crowd by using cover images, custom avatars, additional profile information, contact details, hiring availability and more.You can tag your uploaded images, mark them as work in progress, request critique or finished, make them available for printing and more. Based on artist feedback, we will add new features, tags, categories and image properties on a regular basis.Is it free?Yes. There are no premium profiles, no pro members and no paid features. It's free and it will always be free. Artists, designers and painters will earn points and badges based on their implication and involvement. This includes uploading images, commenting, giving feedback and improving the profile. Moreover, certain events, challenges or contests will allow them to earn badges. The more points and badges a user has, the higher he/she will rank.Are there any limitations?There are no limitations. There are no paid features. There are no obtrusive ads, all advertisement will be CG related and it will provide funds for the community. Ideally, we want to have contests and challenges with hardware/peripherals prizes, such as mice, tablets, drawing pads, software licenses and more.We have a transparency policy and all new features will be voted and vetoed by our users.The site is privately owned. We are also looking for sponsors and investors.User typesBased on points or badges, users will differentiate and become bronze, silver or gold without having to pay.Feature requestsIf any user wants a certain feature, either from another site or completely unique, we will implement it in less than two weeks. We are open to all requests and we want to maintain a happy community.Why Indiegogo?This Indiegogo campaign is meant to purchase dedicated servers and pay for them in advance for several years. Also, the funds will be used to hire moderators, administrators and a QA team.Who am I?I'm a happy daddy!I’m also a PHP/SQL developer with advanced knowledge of database administration and optimization. I’m a web programmer - backend and frontend - with over 13 years of professional experience in the web industry.Interests include game development, travel, photography and movie-making.

<p> </p>
<p>My name is Christina Del Gallo. I am an artist, and a healer. My art evolves from the dictates of my heart. </p>
<p>Connecting as many people as I can to the healing power of their heart has always been my life's work.</p>
<p>I do this by creating and sharing beautiful HealingHearts, created out of my passion to spread love, beauty, and the healing energy of the heart throughout the world.</p>
<p>Before I explain the nature and purpose of the <strong>Have-a-Heart, Give-a-Heart</strong> project I'd like to share with you why I chose the heart as my artistic medium…</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT ABOUT THE HEART?</strong></p>
<p>Did you know that...</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Your Heart Is The Most Powerful Organ Of Your Body?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>It's a scientific fact: Your heart is 5000 times more powerful than your brain. </p>
<p>And did you know that your heart, mine and everyone’s on the planet, is the strongest generator of electrical and magnetic fields?</p>
<p>Which, amazingly, means that...</p>
<p><strong>We are born with the power to harmonize our bodies with the magnetic fields of the earth. </strong></p>
<p>And how about this beautiful fact?...</p>
<p><strong><em>The pulse of your heart beats at  the same rate as the pulse of the universe!</em></strong></p>
<p> Which means, that...</p>
<p><strong>As long as your heart is beating, you are inseparably connected to the universe, and to every other heart on the planet!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So what do those facts have to do with the <strong>Have A Heart Give A Heart </strong>project I would like to share with the world?                                            </p>
<p align=""center""><strong> EVERYTHING!</strong></p>
<p>Let me explain…</p>
<p>HealingHearts are made with the finest silks and velvets and filled with premium quality, luscious organic lavender––known for its rejuvenating properties––and finished with an endless supply of love radiating from my heart. </p>
<p>But what’s most magical about my HealingHearts is that once they’re completed they take on a life of their own. They become imbued with a transformative healing energy.</p>
<p>I know this to be true because I have been creating these hearts for many years and I have witnessed first-hand, and been told by hundreds, that the hearts manifest a distinct healing power.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Each heart I give to someone magically synchronizes with that person’s actual heart, generating exactly the life-enhancing  <br/> healing energy the person needs.</strong></p>
<p>Pretty amazing, don’t you think?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>TO SUCCEED THIS PROJECT NEEDS YOUR ENERGY!</strong></p>
<p>Okay, so now that you know why I chose the heart as my medium let me share with you what the Have A Heart, Give A Heart project is all about…</p>
<p>Have A Heart, Give A Heart is to be an interactive, collaborative, pay-it-forward project<strong>--</strong>a collaboration of shared heart energy––from my heart to yours, from your heart to another’s.</p>
<p>At the heart of the project is a deep felt desire to help the world––you, me and everyone else––shift to a new, heartfelt, life-affirming, cooperative, compassionate community. </p>
<p>A world in which we open our hearts and fall in love—with ourselves and with everyone else.</p>
<p>To succeed, Have A Heart, Give A Heart needs your heart energy, and the shared heart energy of a few hundred others.</p>
<p><strong>Together, you and the others who join in this effort, will become HealingHeart Donors, generating a massive entrainment of thousands of hearts.  </strong></p>
<p>Here's how...</p>
<p>In 3 months time, September, October, November 2012, I will create 333 HealingHearts,</p>
<p>I chose the number 333 because the number three and the number 9 are cosmologically hugely significant.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>They are spiritually the most powerful numbers.</strong></p>
<p>Not only is 3 the mystical power number that throughout history has instilled love, peace, and compassion, <em>it is also particularly significant to this year, 2012.</em></p>
<p>As you know, the Mayan calendar predicts the end of the world, <strong>as we know it</strong>, will occur on 12-21-12.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Notice that those numbers add up to 333! </strong></p>
<p>Well, I am certain the world is definitely not going to end on 12-21-12!</p>
<p>However, our actions and behaviors during the remaining months of 2012 are profoundly important.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>It is critical that we amass the healing energy of our hearts to revitalize and shepherd in a new era of time.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A time when hate no longer exists.</li>
<li>A time when the energy of compassion and love vibrate in everyone’s heart.</li>
<li>A world in which we think with our hearts</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Through a communion of hearts we will help usher in a one-for-all and all-for-one sensibility. Our beating hearts pulsating with peace and love.</p>
<p>With your collaboration<strong>, Have A Heart, Give A Heart</strong>, in its small way, will help to engender this new sensibility.</p>

<p><strong>Christina Del Gallo</strong> <br/><strong>San Francisco, California</strong></p></span></div>","“When a few hundred of us collectively choose to feel feelings that create harmony and coherence in our hearts, the energy of those emotions radiate outward from our heart and reverberate throughout the planet, generating enough energy to alleviate suffering, pain, and disease for thousands.”
 
My name is Christina Del Gallo. I am an artist, and a healer. My art evolves from the dictates of my heart. 
Connecting as many people as I can to the healing power of their heart has always been my life's work.
I do this by creating and sharing beautiful HealingHearts, created out of my passion to spread love, beauty, and the healing energy of the heart throughout the world.
Before I explain the nature and purpose of the Have-a-Heart, Give-a-Heart project I'd like to share with you why I chose the heart as my artistic medium…
 
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT ABOUT THE HEART?
Did you know that...
Your Heart Is The Most Powerful Organ Of Your Body?
 It's a scientific fact: Your heart is 5000 times more powerful than your brain. 
And did you know that your heart, mine and everyone’s on the planet, is the strongest generator of electrical and magnetic fields?
Which, amazingly, means that...
We are born with the power to harmonize our bodies with the magnetic fields of the earth. 
And how about this beautiful fact?...
The pulse of your heart beats at  the same rate as the pulse of the universe!
 Which means, that...
As long as your heart is beating, you are inseparably connected to the universe, and to every other heart on the planet!
 
So what do those facts have to do with the Have A Heart Give A Heart project I would like to share with the world?                                            
 EVERYTHING!
Let me explain…
HealingHearts are made with the finest silks and velvets and filled with premium quality, luscious organic lavender––known for its rejuvenating properties––and finished with an endless supply of love radiating from my heart. 
But what’s most magical about my HealingHearts is that once they’re completed they take on a life of their own. They become imbued with a transformative healing energy.
I know this to be true because I have been creating these hearts for many years and I have witnessed first-hand, and been told by hundreds, that the hearts manifest a distinct healing power.
Each heart I give to someone magically synchronizes with that person’s actual heart, generating exactly the life-enhancing   healing energy the person needs.
Pretty amazing, don’t you think?
 
TO SUCCEED THIS PROJECT NEEDS YOUR ENERGY!
Okay, so now that you know why I chose the heart as my medium let me share with you what the Have A Heart, Give A Heart project is all about…
Have A Heart, Give A Heart is to be an interactive, collaborative, pay-it-forward project--a collaboration of shared heart energy––from my heart to yours, from your heart to another’s.
At the heart of the project is a deep felt desire to help the world––you, me and everyone else––shift to a new, heartfelt, life-affirming, cooperative, compassionate community. 
A world in which we open our hearts and fall in love—with ourselves and with everyone else.
To succeed, Have A Heart, Give A Heart needs your heart energy, and the shared heart energy of a few hundred others.
Together, you and the others who join in this effort, will become HealingHeart Donors, generating a massive entrainment of thousands of hearts.  
Here's how...
In 3 months time, September, October, November 2012, I will create 333 HealingHearts,
I chose the number 333 because the number three and the number 9 are cosmologically hugely significant.
They are spiritually the most powerful numbers.
Not only is 3 the mystical power number that throughout history has instilled love, peace, and compassion, it is also particularly significant to this year, 2012.
As you know, the Mayan calendar predicts the end of the world, as we know it, will occur on 12-21-12.
Notice that those numbers add up to 333! 
Well, I am certain the world is definitely not going to end on 12-21-12!
However, our actions and behaviors during the remaining months of 2012 are profoundly important.
It is critical that we amass the healing energy of our hearts to revitalize and shepherd in a new era of time.

A time when hate no longer exists.
A time when the energy of compassion and love vibrate in everyone’s heart.
A world in which we think with our hearts

 
Through a communion of hearts we will help usher in a one-for-all and all-for-one sensibility. Our beating hearts pulsating with peace and love.
With your collaboration, Have A Heart, Give A Heart, in its small way, will help to engender this new sensibility.
 
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?
Have A Heart, Give A Heart will be overwhelmingly effective if you, and at least 333 others, pledge your commitment to share your heart and the energy of HealingHearts with others.
You do that by donating to the project and in return you receive one or more HealingHearts.
Which you then gift to someone else!

Gift a HealingHeart to a dear soul whose heart longs to be opened.
Share a heart with a loved one, friend or child who is ill. Imbue her with the healing power of your heart and a HealingHeart. 
Gift a heart to a loved one to celebrate your heart connection.
Offer a heart as balm to he who is suffering from a broken heart.  Anyone suffering from emotional or physical pain.
Share a heart with a lonely heart, or a person who needs forgiving.

Your gesture of gifting a HealingHeart and opening your heart to others will entrain your heart with someone else’s heart and synchronize with the heart energy of all the combined hearts creating one very powerful heart healing force!
While you’re at it, be sure you gift yourself a heart!
To get the maximum benefit of your HealingHeart place it where it is readily accessible. Reflect on it every day. Caress it. Smell it. Hold it close to your heart. Meditate on it. Sleep with it.   Your HealingHeart will open your heart to feelings of gratitude, forgiveness, compassion, love, and joy... constantly reminding you that the pulsing of your heartbeat is miraculously synchronized to the heartbeat of the universe.
“When we choose to feel feelings that create harmony and coherence in our hearts––gratitude, compassion, forgiveness––the energy of those emotions extend outward and positively affect thousands of others.”
Whatever your level of participation, you will be an energetic part of Have A Heart, Give A Heart. Everyone can participate at some level. See the Rewards for particulars.
In addition to creating the hearts I am also going to put up a Website and a blog where we can all participate in sharing experiences with our heart and the hearts we gifted to others.
The URL will be: www.HaveAHeartGiveAHeart.com. Whatever your level of participation, you will be honored on the Website as a HealingHeart Donor.
 My hope is that the Website and blog will continue indefinitely as a conduit for releasing wholehearted, expansive heart energy.
And my further hope is that everyone participating in this project, in whatever way, will share their HealingHeart experience on the blog and with one another, so that all our hearts are joined through the energy of cyberspace.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Who Are We?</strong></i></h3>
<p>Hello!<br/>My name is Brianna Wines (Silvixen). I am an Australian artist and one of the contributors for the collaborative charity art project, Artists for the Amazon. Together, over fifty artists from more than twelve countries have set aside their time, passion and skills to create a collection of stunning artwork in response to the 2019 Amazon Rainforest fires. After these devastating fires many of us were asking what we could do to help our beloved environments and wildlife, especially those who didn't have a lot of money to donate and who lived far away. The answer soon became apparent that we could give up our time and use what talents we had to create an incentive for others to help us help them.</p>
<p>We worked to reach out to the public, seeking additional artists to contribute and have put together a second collection, the contest magazine, to show off their work and passion as well.  </p>
<p>These two publications, Artists for the Amazon Art Book and Artists for the Amazon The Contest Magazine contain over one hundred unique pieces of artwork featuring South American wildlife, donated by amazing professional and amateur artists. We hope that by sharing with you these beautiful creatures through our art that you'll share our passion and feel good about contributing to this project.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>The Rainforest Trust</strong></i></h3>
</div><div>
<p>This project was born in the name of helping nature and charities with this focus so we're happy to announce that all profits from this project will be donated directly to <a href=""https://www.rainforesttrust.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Rainforest Trust</a>, an organisation that works to conserve forest habitats and wildlife worldwide. They put their funds where they feel they are needed most (similar to that of World Wildlife Fund) so we'll be assured that even if our contributions don't go directly to the Amazon, they will be helping an ecosystem in need. </p>
<p>We are excited to offer not only two publications but also prints, a team t-shirt, stickers and a charming enamel pin as a reward for backing our project and helping this amazing organisation.<br/>Also two wonderful original pieces direct from the artists themselves. <br/><br/>(Add on perks are available at checkout, you do not need the purchase the bundle to get extra items, see the FAQ for more info.)</p>

<p>Alyesha Wise and Jacob Winterstein here. We met in 2008 as members of Philadelphia’s inaugural poetry slam team. That year along with three other poets we represented Philadelphia at the National Poetry Slam.</p>
<p>Connecting to a national community of writers and performers helped us grow exponentially as artists and become closer as friends. We vowed that when the time was write, we would put on an event that strengthens the performance poetry community in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Since December we've hosted a monthly workshop and poetry slam series that is open to poets of all ages and abilities. </p>
<p>We've already invested almost $2,000 in this project and we're barely breaking even.</p>
<p>We need help raising $2,500 in start-up expenses so this series can really take flight. </p>
<p>We believe this initial investment will make our monthly workshop and poetry slam series sustainable.</p>
<p>Over the first 5 months of this project we've seen how poetry slams can bring diverse groups of people together, build community and encourage poets to grow and evolve. We're turning to our supporters and lovers of poetry to help this event become a cornerstone of Philadelphia's performance poetry community (and get some cool prizes in exchange!). </p>
<h3><strong>The dollars and cents</strong></h3>
<p><strong>We're looking raise $2,500 in 42 days. That's a 100 people who give $25. We know we can do it together. </strong></p>
<p>We need to raise $700 for venue fees and insurance. We were in a great (and cheap!) venue but due to the overwhelming attendance we had to find a bigger space. With a bigger space comes a bigger cost. </p>
<p>We need $800 to film six 1-on-1 Street Slams and six Pigeon Shorts. In this social media age these videos are crucial to growing our audience so this event can pay for itself. Our 1 on 1 Street Slams have been viewed over 2,700 times and help expose new audiences to performance poetry.</p>
<p>More videos = bigger audience = sustainable event</p>
<p>We need to raise $1,000 to send four poets to the Southern Fried Poetry Slam in Tampa Florida. Attending national poetry competitions exposes poets to different styles, skills and resources. Poets competing at Southern Fried will bring back valuable knowledge and experience to the poetry community in Philadelphia. This makes our slams better.</p>
<p>Better slams = bigger audience = sustainable event.  </p>

<p><strong>Gulf Coast Artists Alliance, Inc.</strong> <strong>(GCAA), is a non-profit 501(c)(3) membership based organization</strong>, operating out of St. Petersburg Florida for the past 10 years. The mission of our organization is to provide local artists of all disciplines an opportunity to network, share resources, conduct workshops and classes, and hold exhibitions. <strong>St. Pete Artworks</strong>, our co-operative retail art gallery for local artists in Downtown St. Petersburg, treats visitors to a feast of high-quality painting, sculpture, jewelry, mixed media and more. Our second location, <strong>GCAA Creative Zone</strong>, is a combination of art studios for working artists, a classroom, and meeting space in Pinellas Park. The GCAA general annual membership is comprised of an average of 50 primarily visual artists and art educators; performers, authors, musicians, and other like-minded individuals are welcome and generally comprise about 5% of our membership. An average of 21 of the visual artist members are also members of our co-operative art gallery, St. Pete ArtWorks.</p>
<p><strong>GCAA originally started as The Sculptural Art Center of Dunedin in 2002</strong>. <strong>In 2004 we change the name to Gulf Coast Artists’ Alliance Inc. to reflect a change of location and program focus.</strong> After a nomadic life in several locations throughout Pinellas county, years of meeting out of members’ homes, and various shifts in programing, in 2011 we finally settled in the City of St. Petersburg because we’ve found the city to be a vibrant and stimulating environment. Our goal is to grow our membership and become a strong and vital support system for local artists, while offering the citizens of St. Petersburg and beyond the opportunity to experience our creative expression, camaraderie, and enthusiasm. Support for GCAA has come primarily from memberships, as well as art sales commissions, private donors, and small grants. GCAA is powered 100% by volunteers and has been since its formation.</p>
<p>Due to dramatic increases in rent and gentrification in downtown St. Petersburg, we have been forced to move our location several times. We have not been able to afford a space large enough to have our studios, classes and gallery under one roof. In 2019, we opened the GCAA Creative Zone in the neighboring city of Pinellas Park. We would have preferred to stay in St. Petersburg, but the skyrocketing rents prohibited this at the time. Now, with leases at both locations coming to an end, we have been able to locate a space on Central Avenue in St. Petersburg large enough to accommodate both our co-operative gallery, St. Pete ArtWorks, and our art studios and classroom. It is only two blocks away from our existing retail location, so we expect minimal loss of retail revenue as a result the move. The studio artists will have more public exposure, and more visitors will mean more opportunity for class and workshop registrations. A new member gallery will be added in the classroom area and hallway, giving all of our general members more exhibition opportunities. We are all excited about the move to this improved, centralized location!</p>
<p><strong>This move does not come without additional expenses. We need to raise $5000 to:</strong></p>
<p>1. Purchase and install track lighting</p>
<p>2. Construct walls for artwork display spaces</p>
<p>3. Build out studios</p>
<p>2. Clean and Paint</p>
<p>3. New signage</p>
<p><strong>Most of the labor is being done by volunteers.</strong> Also, there will be considerable moving of existing walls and fixtures from our two current locations, which must be done in a timely manner to minimize double rent expense. We have done this before, each time with unique challenges, but we have overcome these challenges and made lemonade from lemons every time.</p>
<p><strong>We have a wide range of perks for our contributors.</strong> Original artwork, assorted notecards and prints, unique one-of-a-kind journals, mystery gift bags containing artwork by an artist of your choice, jewelry, and workshops. High level contributors will receive name recognition on our website and printed materials, as well as a room named for the donor at our new location. Whatever money we raise will go toward the improvements and moving expenses necessary to make our dreams for GCAA a reality.</p>
<p>If you are not able to contribute at this time, no worries! You can help to spread the word by telling your friends about this great group of artists living and working in your community, and our need. We’ll appreciate you sharing our campaign on your social media sites using the Indiegogo share tools.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>We are five queer Bay Area artists exploring the phenomenon of re-naming within our communities in a collaborative, witty, charming, silly, sexy, charged, gripping performance that you will never forget! Join us as we delve into the ABYSS OF NAMES (to which dead names return and from which new names spring) and investigate naming in relationship to time, place and visibility, identity tourism and consumption, and magic.  Collaboratively we will create a multi-media performance that challenges performance genre segregation by integrating dance, storytelling, experimental music, video, theater, sound, games facilitation, and audience participation.  <br/><br/>Beyond our devotion to our respective art forms, we are dedicated organizers and agents of change within our communities. With our art, we give voice to radical queer perspective and challenge the dominant paradigm.   <br/><br/>The idea for this collaborative was sparked by a merging of artists through our devotion to radical organizing. We found peers and solace, reason to take voice in this way.<br/><p>
</p>

<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>We hope that performing our individual truths about our names will enrich audience members' consciousness about queer identity and the violence and liberatory power of names. Through participatory activities, audience members will be further challenged to consider the politics and potential of naming.<br/><br/>We hope to open an empowered dialog about an unbroached social phenomenon while upholding our integrity as agents of social justice. Through our performance, we hope to encourage personal and community transformation toward collective liberation.  <br/><br/>

<p>So its coming down to the wire and we are onto the best parts of the build. The body, lighting and sound. We need more help to make the playa bound pig...well, just that- <em>playa bound. </em></p>
<p>Already there are new brake components, master cylinder, wheel cylinders and lines. We got the cart running great with a new starter, alternator, voltage regulator, belt, carb rebuild, valve adjustment, plugs, oil and filter.....</p>
<p>So the hard part is done, and now its onto the good stuff! The body is going to be made of thinner sheet metal bent around 1 inch round frame tubing, with recycled goods for the snout and tail. The legs with be metal as well, with more support going into frame work. We just started welding it this week, 7/15. </p>
<p>There will be more support for passengers on either side so there will be two ride-alongs as well as two seats, four passengers total. The windshield is being replaced with plexiglass and the front end reassembled one the snout, ears, and aviator windshield is replaced. We are also swapping suspension pieces from a heavy duty 1972 Cushman Haulster + new shocks. </p>
<p>Alright, enough about whats there. We need a little help with the sheet metal, steel stock, paint, fuel, lighting, and the trailer. We are looking to build up a super duty harbor freight trailer up to spec just for Mr. Piggy. We have already spent much of our own money this one and were looking for a little extra help to get it playa bound. So please take a look at the incentives and donate what you can.We are so thankful for any and all donations and we will be so happy if we can reach our goal!</p>

I earned my Bachelor of Fine Arts with a concentration in Printmaking and Sculpture. Since leaving school, I have been looking for a space and opportunity to continue my art and make a name for myself. <br/><br/>Graduating was like falling into the shark infested waters of the ""real world"". Come to find out I wasn't the only one drowning in countless unanswered questions. Many artists often wave the white flag too early on in life and give up on their dream.  My plan is to make sure that artists have a place to continue experimenting and developing their art while working in a collaborative atmosphere.  Shark Tank Studio would also be a gateway for these emerging artists to show off their stuff and get exposure.  <br/><br/>My reason for creating Shark Tank Studio is to create an opportunity to stay connected with a select group of artists whom I have worked with and come to admire. I may be their number one fan now, but I know you are going to be big fans too once you get to see their work! The studio will  be set up in Whitman, MA, a central location for the current group of emerging artists to work.  <br/><br/>With your help Shark Tank Studio will be able to purchase its first press. This will enable a group of artists to not only continue to pursue their passion, but prosper while doing it. These artists deserve the chance to have their work displayed. The best way to get it there is with your help! Shark Tank’s first press (that the studio has high hopes to purchase) would allow artists to work in a range of techniques like intaglio (etching), relief, monotype and lithography. <br/><br/>If we can’t meet our goal of $5250.00, the money we do fundraise will go to directly into the studio in different ways. We would still be able to purchase other printing materials like blocks and plates for the actual printing process, tools, or even a smaller table top printing press model.

My name's Jen Delos Reyes. I was born in the city of Winnipeg, and educated first in its local music scene of the mid-90’s infused with the energy of Riot grrrl and DIY, and then in its university. How I work today as an artist, educator, writer, and radical community arts organizer is rooted in what I learned in my formative years as a show promoter, listener, creator of zines, and band member. </span></p>

We can look to artists to show us how to creatively shape our daily existence. They can model for us the worlds we want to live in. </span></p>

The book will examine the social movements, cultural theory, and philosophies that were influencing these artists from political activism, intentional living, pioneering figures, and Eastern philosophies. It will trace a history of artists who have worked on the border of art and life and culminate in chapters looking at the work of  Fritz Haeg, David Horvitz, J. Morgan Puett,Ben Kinmont, and Mierle Laderman Ukeles. These artists use daily acts of living to connect their artistic practice to their life values and philosophies.</span></p>

</div></div>","Summary
Hello! My name's Jen Delos Reyes. I was born in the city of Winnipeg, and educated first in its local music scene of the mid-90’s infused with the energy of Riot grrrl and DIY, and then in its university. How I work today as an artist, educator, writer, and radical community arts organizer is rooted in what I learned in my formative years as a show promoter, listener, creator of zines, and band member. 
I spend most of my time thinking about socially engaged art, whether it is through my role as the director of Open Engagement, a national conference on the subject, or teaching about it in the Art in Social Practice Program at Portland State University. For the last year and a half I have been focusing my research, writing, and speaking engagements around the importance of art in everyday life and artists who have used their creative practices to live with meaning and purpose.
I'm Going to Live the Life I Sing About in my Song: How Artists Make and Live Lives of Meaning is a book that will provide inspiration for readers to see how they can creatively shape their own lives with purpose and meaning. It looks at how artists have used their creativity to shape the world they want to see and taken steps towards creating the lives they want to live.
There are many people that one can look to for help living well, whether that be Martha Stewart, Elizabeth Gilbert, or countless self-help books about improving your life. As an artist myself I am choosing to look to other artists.
Artists have a way of provoking new forms of being. They examine and challenge the ways that we live and work. They propose alternative approaches, and suggest ways of navigating and negotiating existing systems. This book will provide inspiration to readers to see how they can also creatively shape their own lives with purpose and meaning, modify systems and structures, and in turn change the world we inhabit together.
The book will give an inside look into these artists daily lives through in-depth on-site visits, interviews, images of their homes and workplaces, and a foreword that will unpack the history of the artists impulse toward art and everyday life. The book will be a full-color document that will lay bare the quotidian as well as monumental aspects of their work and lives. It will give an inside look at how these artists approach not only their work, but their days, schedules, relationships and how they live. 
 Images from onsite interviews with artists.
Many of the artists that blur the boundary between art and life have an approach that is not merely a project, but, in the words of John Cage, they treat art as an “experimental station in which one tries out living.” In these experiments artists are shaping the world around them through their art. We can look to artists to show us how to creatively shape our daily existence. They can model for us the worlds we want to live in. 
This book will serve as a road map of where others have been - through a series of interviews with visionary artists/philosophers/thinkers- towards creating the lives we want to live and the worlds we want to see through the creativity of artists who have used their work to make and live lives of meaning. The book will examine the social movements, cultural theory, and philosophies that were influencing these artists from political activism, intentional living, pioneering figures, and Eastern philosophies. It will trace a history of artists who have worked on the border of art and life and culminate in chapters looking at the work of  Fritz Haeg, David Horvitz, J. Morgan Puett,Ben Kinmont, and Mierle Laderman Ukeles. These artists use daily acts of living to connect their artistic practice to their life values and philosophies.
 
------------------------
The Book
I am not releasing this book through an academic press not only to have full control over the design decisions, but more importantly because I believe that all contributors need to be compensated for their work.
I am releasing this book as a 200 page full color, case bound book with cloth cover. I want to create a beautiful book that will highlight the work of the amazing artists I am featuring, some of which have only a handful of publications available about their work. 
eBook
There are going to be two digital versions of the book:
1. Full-content HTML-based web edition of the book optimized for the iPad.
2. A PDF version that will be compatible with iPad and Kindle. 
------------------------
Funds- Goal: $25,000.00
The initial research for the project was supported by the Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago in the summer of 2013.
In 2014 I received a small Regional Arts and Culture Grant that has made it possible to travel and conduct the interviews with the five featured artists.
Now what is needed are funds for:
Paying everyone involved in the book. Paying the contributing artists. Paying people who are working alongside me on the book: professional editor, project manager/documentarian, designers, and research assistant—$7,750.
Production of the book in a run of 1000 printed locally in Portland, OR—$15,000.00

A portion of the funds raised will be put towards allowing me to set aside a few months to exclusively work on the writing for the book—$4000,00
$2,250 of the $25,000 is the crowd funding fees.

The estimated timeline is that interviews will be wrapped by the end of 2014. Intensive writing will happen in 2015. Book to be released in 2016.
------------------------
Perks
You can be part of making this project happen! You can support the project at any rate, starting at $5, and any donation of $37 or more pre-orders your copy of the book.
If you can contribute more, there are reciprocal benefits that include signed copies of the book, limited editions, and more.

Mierle Laderman Ukeles 
“That is what maintenance is, trying to listen to the hum of living. A feeling of being alive, breath to breath.”
Mierle Laderman Ukeles is an artist whose work is about maintenance, relationships, and care. She looks at the overlooked, the garbage, the daily chores, the workers.
Since 1970 she has been the unsalaried artist-in-residence for New York City's Sanitation Department where she builds and orchestrates major public projects that explore the social and ecological issues of waste management. 

Risks and challenges:
One risk of the project is that I am not releasing this book through an academic press. However I am choosing to see this as an opportunity.
Most, if not all academic presses operate on model that does not compensate their contributors.
I believe that all participants need to be compensated for their work and I am looking for support from the Kickstarter community who believe both in this project and in fair wages for work.

FAQ:
Question: What if my address changes before the book is released?
Answer: Before any shipments are made we will verify the address in case of change.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello everyone! On behalf of some of the members of PC '13, we have decided to commission Mike Savage to paint a picture of KU's Kappa Alpha Theta. For those of you who may be unfamiliar with Mike Savage, he is an iconic painter in the Kansas City area that specializes in many of Kansas City's, as well as KU's, landmarks. Below, we have included some examples of Savage's paintings of Greek houses on KU's campus. We hope that with this fundraiser we can have a beautiful painting of the Theta house!<br/></p>

<p>As recent graduates we would love to have a way to keep Theta with us, even though we have left Lawrence. We believe that PC' 13 can't possibly be the only ones who hold Theta so near and dear to our hearts, so we started this campaign in order to raise funds for a Mike Savage Kappa Alpha Theta painting. </p>
<p>This online campaign is to raise $1,050.00. This total amount includes the creation of the original painting which is priced at $1000.00 (24 x 30 canvas and frame) and a $50.00 fee for the use of this website. Once the painting is completed (expected date around November 1st) it will be made into prints that can be ordered through Mike's gallery, just like all of his other work. The prints are very reasonably priced and come in a variety of sizes. We plan to donate the original framed painting to the Theta house in Lawrence, KS. </p>
<p>The rough sketch of the painting is below. Keep in mind that we plan to make further adjustments because there are minor things we would like to change, such as removing the large ""KAO"" and adding the yard and circle drive. However, we wanted to ensure that we would have enough money for the completion of the painting before moving further along in the process. </p>

<p>This campaign will run for 60 days. Without raising this money, we will not be able to create this image! If we do not receive the full $1,050.00 in 60 days, all of the money that has been donated will be returned to the credit cards you used to make the donation. Most major credit cards are taken. Remember, your donation to this site is just for the original painting and then around mid-November you can order prints through Mike Savage's website. </p>

want to honour Stompin’ Tom Connors with a life-sized, bronze statue in
downtown Sudbury, Ontario,</b> near arts and hockey venues.</p>
<p>And we hope to say that Canadians participated, from every city and town in Canada, coast
to coast! </p>
<p><b>We’ve already raised more than
20% of our $50,000 goal locally</b>, and we’re going to have some pretty lively
fundraisers here in Sudbury.  But,
Stompin’ Tom belonged to all of Canada. 
He sang OUR stories, from the legend of Big Joe Mufferaw to the devotion
of Hockey Moms across the land. He was
authentic and raw, and we miss this true Canadian voice. </p><p>

something really special...</b>The artist, Tyler
Fauvelle, created a <b>limited edition art
resin sculpture <u>exclusively</u> for this project. </b> Tyler says that the artwork, called “Dear
Canada”, is inspired by the final letter Tom Connors wrote to his fans.  The edition is limited to 45, and is not for
sale.  We’re sending them as a “thank
you” to those who contribute at least $500 ($425 for you Early Birds) to this
commemoration.  Each piece is numbered,
and comes with a commemoration certificate of authenticity, signed by the
artist.  “Dear Canada” measures 8” high,
and is hand-finished in verdigris.</p>
<p> “<i>Stompin’ Tom’s music was inspired by the
vivid beauty of our country, and he sang the extraordinary stories of ordinary
people. The guitar stock in the sculpture bends toward the flames of the maple
leaf, forming a heart-space, and representing the passion of the patriotic
torch Tom held before our eyes, and hoped we would keep ablaze.  Tom Connors loved Canada, and it’s as simple
– and as complicated – as that.  The
verdigris finish suggests legacy, and a certain roughness, because Tom’s road
was rarely easy<span>. His famous hat is represented
here, of course, resting by the guitar – close to the music, where it belongs.”

<p></p></div>","We Love Stompin' Tom!
We’re a non-profit group of ordinary folks, from
the land of Sudbury Saturday Night, and huge Stompin’ Tom fans.  Our goal is simple:  We
want to honour Stompin’ Tom Connors with a life-sized, bronze statue in
downtown Sudbury, Ontario, near arts and hockey venues.
And we hope to say that Canadians participated, from every city and town in Canada, coast
to coast! 
We’ve already raised more than
20% of our $50,000 goal locally, and we’re going to have some pretty lively
fundraisers here in Sudbury.  But,
Stompin’ Tom belonged to all of Canada. 
He sang OUR stories, from the legend of Big Joe Mufferaw to the devotion
of Hockey Moms across the land. He was
authentic and raw, and we miss this true Canadian voice. 

A local sculptor, Tyler Fauvelle (see photo, above), has finished sculpting the life-sized artwork in clay. It's now at the foundry, for casting in bronze.Please
join in...When the sculpture’s unveiled, we want to say: Hello there!  And
thanks to people from every city and town in Canada!How do we thank you for your contribution?
We’ve
designed a special logo, exclusively for buttons,
T-shirts and plaques, so that you can proudly show you participated in
paying tribute to Tom...Show off  your
T-shirt at the next sporting event or concert you go to!  Get your office buddies together, and earn a
plaque for the coffee room...If your Mom spent years taking you to hockey and
cheering for you in a cold arena, play the Hockey Mom song for her, and give
her a button!  (And a hug!) 
If you
send $10, we’ll know you’re thinking of Stompin’ Tom, and we promise to tip a
hat to his statue in your honour. (There’ll be a photo on our Facebook page.)
For
something really special...The artist, Tyler
Fauvelle, created a limited edition art
resin sculpture exclusively for this project.  Tyler says that the artwork, called “Dear
Canada”, is inspired by the final letter Tom Connors wrote to his fans.  The edition is limited to 45, and is not for
sale.  We’re sending them as a “thank
you” to those who contribute at least $500 ($425 for you Early Birds) to this
commemoration.  Each piece is numbered,
and comes with a commemoration certificate of authenticity, signed by the
artist.  “Dear Canada” measures 8” high,
and is hand-finished in verdigris.
 “Stompin’ Tom’s music was inspired by the
vivid beauty of our country, and he sang the extraordinary stories of ordinary
people. The guitar stock in the sculpture bends toward the flames of the maple
leaf, forming a heart-space, and representing the passion of the patriotic
torch Tom held before our eyes, and hoped we would keep ablaze.  Tom Connors loved Canada, and it’s as simple
– and as complicated – as that.  The
verdigris finish suggests legacy, and a certain roughness, because Tom’s road
was rarely easy. His famous hat is represented
here, of course, resting by the guitar – close to the music, where it belongs.”

</div></div>","The story so far:

My name is Tony Plant. I am an independent, UK artist, have been for over 20 years. It's been a stretch at times but always hugely rewarding. By choice I work outside in remote and wild places, the world over, focussing attention on natural shape, colour and form. My work is a direct response to the environment in which it is placed.


The Last Tree on Earth is a creative attempt to affect change and highlight issues of sustainability and environmental impact etc by placing a trigger  (in the form of a painting) inside the viewers' home/work place. Sixteen paintings, as pictured with Andy Cummins. see below (ranging from 30cm to 1 metre square)




Every multiple of $1,001 raised will ensure another of the 16 paintings is out travelling, evoking and gathering personal stories, highlighting the importance of relationships we as individuals attach to trees in general and specific trees in particular.

The intention is for each painting to travel through a broad ranging set of individuals. This will ensure that the degree of focus within each set of response groups remains high. A number of creative groups have already been confirmed as starting points for some of the paintings. These include:


surf communities in Hawaii and Ireland 

professional story tellers in schools 
British Antarctic Survey Scientists 
various faith groups  
artists
musicians
theatre groups 
outreach centres 

environmentalists, NGO's 

film makers

What We Need & Why


In order to keep the original idea intact we need help with practicalities. We have learnt from the last 2 months, how difficult it is to move paintings through many hands, countries and borders.



1 small 30cm painting (left) just came back to the UK from a quick test trip around the Hawaiian islands in December, where it was introduced to surfers, Buttons Kaluhiokalani, Dave Rastovitch (left) Shane Dorian to blatantly name drop but a few, however, aside from triggering some amazing responses (and featuring in a UK Magazine, left) it's journey has highlighted the problems associated with transport/movement of paintings. In order to physically move a maximum of 16 around, individually made, tough, light, simple freight boxes need to be made. 
Hence this campaign, ""more cash, more miles and more time away"".



Every multiple of $1,001 will ensure another of the 16 paintings is out travelling safely. Gathering personal stories, highlighting the importance of relationships we as individuals attach to trees in general and specific trees in particular (it also ensures the painting returns for exhibition alongside the other 15 paintings)

My lifestyle is based on the cycles and seasons of Nature, and I created this annual lunar planning tool based on my own amazing life experiences of the past ten years - tracking the fertility cycles of my own body, growing and wildcrafting food and medicine and living off-grid and out under the open sky. I needed a visual tool to help me understand how to manage my time and work with the energies of the seasons and moon phases. This planner was re-created in various forms over the years. I have experimented, explored and created my life with La Luna as my guide! LunaRhythms is the culmination of this work, and I lovingly offer her to the you in the hope that she will be of service to <strong><i>You</i> </strong><i>and your</i><strong> <i>amazing life</i>!</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>LunaRhythms is an invitation to care for ourselves by paying attention to our bodies and the phases of the moon as we make our life plans</i>. </strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Many of us are trying to function in a world that is out of touch with the natural cycles and seasons of life, a world that is out of touch with the Divine Feminine. We may find ourselves feeling exhausted and wondering if there is another way to be. How can we understand what it is we truly want and need when we are too busy with endless actions to pause for a moment and connect? Body awareness and Nature connection are keys to sourcing from a place of feminine power and allowing our intuition to guide us.

<h3>Art can heal and uplift...</h3>
<p>...and I hope to be able to use this campaign to give the gift of art to the VA Hospital of Buffalo as well as Hospice of Buffalo with hopes that it will provide healing, hope, and renewal of the hearts and minds of the patients, visitors, and workers.</p>
<p><strong>A little story</strong></p>
<p>My father, a USMC Veteran, was diagnosed with Stage Four pancreatic cancer in January of 2012. During his end of life journey, he had the chance to receive services at the VA of Buffalo as well as Hospice of Buffalo.</p>
<p>During those times, while he was able, my brother and I would walk around with him through out the hallways of the VA as he received medical treatment. The VA had some art prints in varying states of quality. My father enjoyed looking into these paintings and they would make him feel better, as it did to my brother and I. From prints of Edward Hopper's lighthouses or sailboats, to Monet's water littlies, these wall hangings helped uplift our spirits.</p>
<p>When he was transferred to Hospice of Buffalo, my brother and I would wheel him around their hallways where he enjoyed looking at many donated works, from originals in Oil and acrylic, or finger paintings from children. He enjoyed these little trips until his own personal life's journey came to an end a short time later. My brother and walked the hallways during the wee hours of the night and found our minds made at peace as we shared the enjoyment at viewing the works on display. This has made me realize not only how powerful in healing art can be.</p>
<p><strong>About me</strong></p>
<p>As his son, I was blessed with a talent for art and with painting. I am a painter in oils. I paint in a traditional representational fashion. I try to use my painting skills as a gift from God to capture the beauty of the places all over this great country, as well as the beauty of still lifes.</p>
<p>I am not a fully established professional, but I have won a few small awards for my works and people enjoy the traditional representation landscapes and still lifes that I made. I have studied art for years, majored in Art in High school, studied it in college, and have pursuit the development of my skills as a painter for all of my life. I use professional techniques, professional grade materials, principles of design, composition, color theory, and other skills &amp; techniques to create works that speak to peoples hearts and minds.</p>
<p>You can view some of my paintings on <a href=""http://pinterest.com/robertbrittonjr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""My Pinterest Site"">my Pinterest Site</a>, or read about my art journey on <a href=""http://robertbrittonjr.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""My Blog"">my blogspot blog</a>.</p>
<p>Just before my dad passed, I made this painting for him. It was from a trip he took to visit my wife and I while we were in AZ. We saw this herd of Elk up in Flagstaff including this young calf being watched over by the elders of the herd:</p>

<h3>My Goal &amp; What is Needed</h3>
<p>Here's my goal:</p>
<p>I have contacted both the VA Hospital of Buffalo and the Hospice of Buffalo with the intention to create a series of related paintings for each organization,including landscapes and still lifes ranging in size from 12"" x 16"" through 24"" x 30"". These paintings will be created with professional grade materials, framed, and ready for hanging and display. The themes of each will be designed intentionally to be warm, harmonious, and use colors, values, shapes, and motifs that uplift the spirit.</p>
<p>Through coordination with the Hospice of Buffalo and the VA of Buffalo, I intend to have them hung in common areas where the patients, families, visitors, and workers can pass by and take a moment to get lost in the paintings, refreshing their hearts and spirits.</p>
<p>The following list outlines the materials and related cost items to make this campaign successful:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1000 for linen canvas panels, stretchers, oil paints, mediums</li>
<li>$1200 for durable painting frames and hanging equipment</li>
<li>$300 for containers, packaging, shipping and installation</li>
</ul><p>I anticipate that creating (6) paintings will take roughly six to eight weeks, plus a short period of time for the oil paints to cure and be varnished and framed. If I'm successful in achieving the funding needed to get started, my schedule goal is to complete the works ready for hanging in May of this year.</p>
<p>Should this campaign raise less than the targeted amount, I will proportionally reduce the number of works given the actual amounts donated.</p>
<p>Should this campaign raise more than the targeted amount, then I would like to use those funds to broaden the reach to create works for the other places of healing here in Buffalo including Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Catholic Hospital, et al, where these types of paintings would provide healing and happiness.</p>
<p>While at this time, I do not know what the response will be, there is a hope that I will be afforded the chance to use my skills and passion as a painter to spread paintings into places that heal.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<div>
<p>As a ex-US Navy enlisted man, and a patriot, I believe that our Veterans deserve not only great quality of medical care at the VA, but an aesthetic experience that helps uplift and heal their spirits. I also believe that those who are on their end of life journey, including their friends &amp; family who are supporting them,  should have the chance to view works of art that bring back happy memories of their life experiences.</p>
<p>I have personally experienced the healing and uplifting power of art. I have seen people become calmed, their minds made at peace, the sparkle of their eyes brightened while viewing art.</p>
<p>As a painter, I struggle with finding a way to use my talents to spread love and compassion to others. God blessed me with this talent, and I strongly desire to be able to use this campaign to bring the healing and uplifting power of art to our veterans and our family members who are on end of life journeys. I know that I have to try and seek the resources necessary and to successfully complete this campaign with hopes and prayers that these gifts of the donations of the resources as well as the final paintings will help touch many lives at the VA Hospital of Buffalo and Hospice of Buffalo.</p>
<p>Your financial support is like a brush stroke embedded into each painting...a brush stroke of care, encouragement, of love, and support for those who's minds and bodies are troubled. Your financial support will help uplift and heal many people for years to come.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you've read to this point, I'd ask you to provide the support you can. If you can contribute financially towards this campaign goal, it would be a tremendous blessing. If you don't have the means to contribute financially, please spread the word and help me find others who may have the resources to help hit this campaign goal.</p>
<p>The other thing I would ask you to do is to visit your local VA Hospital or local Hospice. Each organization does wonderful things in providing care and support of our friends, families and communities. There are many ways you can touch the lives of our veterans, or the lives of those who are passing onward into the next life. There are many volunteer opportunities out there, and lives that can be helped and touched if you take a step forward.</p>
<p>God bless, and thank you in advance for your support. I will make it my passion and will dedicate myself whole-heartedly to maximizing the success of this project. There are many people who can be helped through the healing power of art. I hope to an instrument as a painter to touch as many lives as I can using the blessings of my talent.</p>
<p>There's so much beauty that God has placed around us in this world, from natual landscapes and beautiful gardens, to the wonderful works of art that abound.</p>
<p>I pray for your help in affording me use my talent in painting to bring healing and uplifting joy and happiness to others.</p></div>","Art can heal and uplift...
...and I hope to be able to use this campaign to give the gift of art to the VA Hospital of Buffalo as well as Hospice of Buffalo with hopes that it will provide healing, hope, and renewal of the hearts and minds of the patients, visitors, and workers.
A little story
My father, a USMC Veteran, was diagnosed with Stage Four pancreatic cancer in January of 2012. During his end of life journey, he had the chance to receive services at the VA of Buffalo as well as Hospice of Buffalo.
During those times, while he was able, my brother and I would walk around with him through out the hallways of the VA as he received medical treatment. The VA had some art prints in varying states of quality. My father enjoyed looking into these paintings and they would make him feel better, as it did to my brother and I. From prints of Edward Hopper's lighthouses or sailboats, to Monet's water littlies, these wall hangings helped uplift our spirits.
When he was transferred to Hospice of Buffalo, my brother and I would wheel him around their hallways where he enjoyed looking at many donated works, from originals in Oil and acrylic, or finger paintings from children. He enjoyed these little trips until his own personal life's journey came to an end a short time later. My brother and walked the hallways during the wee hours of the night and found our minds made at peace as we shared the enjoyment at viewing the works on display. This has made me realize not only how powerful in healing art can be.
About me
As his son, I was blessed with a talent for art and with painting. I am a painter in oils. I paint in a traditional representational fashion. I try to use my painting skills as a gift from God to capture the beauty of the places all over this great country, as well as the beauty of still lifes.
I am not a fully established professional, but I have won a few small awards for my works and people enjoy the traditional representation landscapes and still lifes that I made. I have studied art for years, majored in Art in High school, studied it in college, and have pursuit the development of my skills as a painter for all of my life. I use professional techniques, professional grade materials, principles of design, composition, color theory, and other skills & techniques to create works that speak to peoples hearts and minds.
You can view some of my paintings on my Pinterest Site, or read about my art journey on my blogspot blog.
Just before my dad passed, I made this painting for him. It was from a trip he took to visit my wife and I while we were in AZ. We saw this herd of Elk up in Flagstaff including this young calf being watched over by the elders of the herd:

<h2>2/20/13: PROJECT GOAL CHANGE</h2>
<p>I will donate a sculpture to AMOCA even if we don't make the $30K goal -- the size will be determined by how much funds are pledged.  In this way your contribution is guaranteed to help make a new piece of public art happen!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello, and thanks for visiting my FertiliTree Campaign!</p>
<p>I worked in the corporate world for 15 years in Industrial Design until I quit that in ‘04 to devote my life to art.  After leaving that career I traveled through Thailand and India for a year, studying meditation and yoga, and filling my creative spirit with inspiration from all the ancient art and architecture.  I returned with a desire to express fundamental truths about our human nature through my artworks.  </p>
The FertiliTree will be planted near the entrance of the museum’s new location in Pomona, just east of LA.   Pomona is the Roman goddess of fruit trees, of abundance, fruitfulness, and fertility, and so I used these themes to guide the design of the sculpture.  FertiliTree has no branches and leaves, but she’ll fulfill her purpose of bearing fruits of inspiration, wonder, and pleasure in the hearts of all who see her!</div><div class=""full-description""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1130839/files/20150104110437-FertiliTree_2.jpg?1420398277"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div class=""full-description"">
<p>The model of the piece shown above is a rough computer sketch– the final sculpture will have far more detail, color, and nuanced expression, like the Seeds have, and my Labradorite Priestess below</p>
<h3 class=""template asset""><img alt=""Labradorite Priestess"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/311/701/45f0307d989aa70b0ec041d63864b8f5_large.jpg?1355968911"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>The FertiliTree will be by far the largest and most ambitious project I've attempted to date.   Not only will it be a wonderful addition to the museums collection and to the city of Pomona, while giving my artistic career a major boost, but it also has the potential to make a huge difference in the world, as a model for community-based funding of public art pieces, PLUS an incredibly economic fabrication method! </p>
<p>Public art makes a place feel loved and cared for, transforming the cities we live in from primarily functional, utilitarian spaces to places of genuine beauty, inspiration, and joy, which the world could sure use a lot more of!</p>
<p>For public works, I've invented a unique process of filling the ceramic sections with concrete when the piece is installed, making it incredibly strong and resilient. With this method I’ve developed we can eventually build sculptures 50-100 ft. tall, for a fraction of the cost of other public art fabrication methods.  They can be elaborately sculpted in a 3D modelling program, giving a very wide range of creative expressions.  Plus, the available glazes give an extraordinary range of color possibilities, far more and far more durable than classic public art methods.</p>
<p>Antoni Gaudi used ceramic elements and mosaics in his construction of Parc Guell and many other buildings in Barcelona 100 years ago, which are just as beautiful today as they were when they were first made.  This new method I’ve developed, of filling hollow ceramic forms with concrete, is much more versatile, economical, and swift, since the form for the concrete is the ceramic itself!</p>

<h3>PREMIUMS FOR YOUR DONATION</h3>
<p>Here are a samples of the Seeds you’ll be able to choose for your reward.  I'll be making many more over the next few weeks, and will have quite a variety for you to select from.  I'll contact you after you've donated to choose the design you want.  The 9"" versions are $50-$100, and the 2' versions are $500-$750.  Prior to this my artworks have sold for thousands of dollars, and I'm thrilled to be able to offer people a unique piece of art at a price that many more can afford, allowing my artwork to spread out into the world much farther than it has so far!</p>
<p>These will be available as Full Seeds, made of two halves attached together, or Half Seeds, which be just the front side, open on the back.  Half Seeds may be hung on your wall, and both types may be displayed on your desk, a mantle, a window ledge or altar, or wherever else you'd like to place this unique piece of art.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>I<b> </b>am an artist who has been teaching art and photography in northern Rhode Island for the more than 20 years. During that time four of my students have been lost to gun violence. The One Gun Gone project is a positive professional art making , marketing exercise and community engagement that was developed in response to these experiences. </p>
<p>One Gun Gone is a multidisciplinary anti gun violence art project supported by students from underserved neighborhoods in urban RI. Our goal has been to take one gun off the streets, make art from it and then sell that art to fund a gun buy back. We have made the art, now we are working to sell it to fund our police sanctioned gun buy back. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>The ideas for One Gun Gone sculptures have come from thoughtful reflection on what materials we use and what those materials say about gun violence. Each of our four sculptural types started as ideas and then through trial and error became statements against gun violence in their own rite. </p>
<p>The transparent glass used in One Gun Gone's <strong>Glass Gun Sculptures </strong>reminds us that life is fragile. </p>
<p>Our <strong>Pencil Gun Sculpture </strong>reminds us (hopefully) that education is a way out of a life that has gun violence in it. </p>
<p>Our <strong>Crayon Gun Sculpture  </strong>reminds us that many children (crayons are primarily a child's art medium) are learning about gun violence too early in their lives. </p>
<p>Our fully functioning <strong>Candle Gun Sculpture </strong>reflects on the votive candles that are often used in roadside shrines erected when someone is killed by gun violence. We wanted to make a candle that reflected why people were being mourned in the first place. </p>
<p>Our <strong>One Gun Gone T-Shirt </strong>was designed by OGG students and designers from NAIL communications. It was hand silk screened by OGG students. </p>
<p>Our <strong>One Gun Gone Poster </strong>was was printed and collaboratively designed by DWRI Letter Press in Providence RI. This is a limited edition of 250 die cut, letter pressed posters suitable for framing. Students and lead artist Scott Lapham have signed the back of each poster. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>The One Gun Gone project is not only an art and marketing project. It is also a citizenship project. By this I am not referring to the legal definition of citizenship, but instead the difference between a resident and an engaged citizen. Before the One Gun Gone project many students knew they didn't like gun violence in their communities but they also didn't see a way to raise their voice against it. The One Gun Gone project has helped form that voice. This project is working to change inaction to action. This project is a lesson to all the young people participating in it. This lesson says that if you are passionate about change, you can work with the skill sets you have to make a difference in your community. It says that you can step out of your comfort zone and collaborate with others who have skill sets different than yours. And that in life, you sometimes need to.</p>
<p>I have seen the difference real world public art projects have had with my teenage students. After seeing a large project through to completion their perceptions of what they think is possible in their own lives is changed for the better . Our ""Moving Bus"" project took photographic portraits of public transportation riders and used those portraits to create a RI Public Transportation Authority bus wrapped with the positive images of its riders. The response to the finished project was overwhelmingly positive but the road to finishing the project was not easy. Students witnessed in real time the technical, financial and bureaucratic challenges in that project becoming a reality. They also witnessed that perseverance and teamwork among many different stake holders brought the project to fruition. These are some of the less tangible benefits that supporting the One Gun Gone project encourages. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The One Gun Gone project has many, many people to thank. We are honored that Mass College of Art and Design, NAIL communications, New Urban Arts, The RI State Police, The Providence Police Dept, RI Council for the Arts, The Dept of Arts, Culture and Tourism of the City of Providence and others have supported our efforts through financial donation, access to facilities and dialog. </p>
<p>Our challenge now is selling our artwork to raise the money for our goal of funding a gun buy back. Every step in this long process has been a leap of faith. Each organization we have partnered with did not have to support us and we did not know if they would. We are proud of the art work we have made and are now showing it to large audience for the first time this Fall. Selling our artworks is now our next leap of faith. As you learn more about the One Gun Gone project we hope that you will partner with us too by purchasing our artwork. You can also support this project by sharing it. The more people that see the One Gun Gone project the more opportunity we have of reaching our goal. </p>

Our Crayon Gun Sculpture  reminds us that many children (crayons are primarily a child's art medium) are learning about gun violence too early in their lives. 
Our fully functioning Candle Gun Sculpture reflects on the votive candles that are often used in roadside shrines erected when someone is killed by gun violence. We wanted to make a candle that reflected why people were being mourned in the first place. 
Our One Gun Gone T-Shirt was designed by OGG students and designers from NAIL communications. It was hand silk screened by OGG students. 
Our One Gun Gone Poster was was printed and collaboratively designed by DWRI Letter Press in Providence RI. This is a limited edition of 250 die cut, letter pressed posters suitable for framing. Students and lead artist Scott Lapham have signed the back of each poster. 
 
The Impact

The One Gun Gone project is not only an art and marketing project. It is also a citizenship project. By this I am not referring to the legal definition of citizenship, but instead the difference between a resident and an engaged citizen. Before the One Gun Gone project many students knew they didn't like gun violence in their communities but they also didn't see a way to raise their voice against it. The One Gun Gone project has helped form that voice. This project is working to change inaction to action. This project is a lesson to all the young people participating in it. This lesson says that if you are passionate about change, you can work with the skill sets you have to make a difference in your community. It says that you can step out of your comfort zone and collaborate with others who have skill sets different than yours. And that in life, you sometimes need to.
I have seen the difference real world public art projects have had with my teenage students. After seeing a large project through to completion their perceptions of what they think is possible in their own lives is changed for the better . Our ""Moving Bus"" project took photographic portraits of public transportation riders and used those portraits to create a RI Public Transportation Authority bus wrapped with the positive images of its riders. The response to the finished project was overwhelmingly positive but the road to finishing the project was not easy. Students witnessed in real time the technical, financial and bureaucratic challenges in that project becoming a reality. They also witnessed that perseverance and teamwork among many different stake holders brought the project to fruition. These are some of the less tangible benefits that supporting the One Gun Gone project encourages. 
 

Risks & Challenges
The One Gun Gone project has many, many people to thank. We are honored that Mass College of Art and Design, NAIL communications, New Urban Arts, The RI State Police, The Providence Police Dept, RI Council for the Arts, The Dept of Arts, Culture and Tourism of the City of Providence and others have supported our efforts through financial donation, access to facilities and dialog. 
Our challenge now is selling our artwork to raise the money for our goal of funding a gun buy back. Every step in this long process has been a leap of faith. Each organization we have partnered with did not have to support us and we did not know if they would. We are proud of the art work we have made and are now showing it to large audience for the first time this Fall. Selling our artworks is now our next leap of faith. As you learn more about the One Gun Gone project we hope that you will partner with us too by purchasing our artwork. You can also support this project by sharing it. The more people that see the One Gun Gone project the more opportunity we have of reaching our goal.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong><em>Using video to enhance patient well-being</em><br/></strong></p>
<p><em>Flourish</em> is part of Air Arts Autumn/ Winter season of exhibitions for Royal Derby Hospital. Ten regional artists were challenged to create a piece of work for the exhibition, being asked to explore the notion of <em>flourish</em>, responding with a piece that would be aimed towards the benefit of patients at Royal Derby Hospital.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Air Arts</strong></p>
<p>Started in 2006, Air Arts’ mission was to <em>create a well being program enhancing the experience of all hospital patients, visitors and staff that is fully embedded in the culture of the hospital, devised in partnership and with demonstrable benefits</em>.</p>
<p>The Air Arts programme will work in partnership to support individual’s experiences and their ability to travel through an often unfamiliar and intimidating environment. The performance and exhibitions arts programme will provide memorable beacons for navigation and a welcoming journey through the hospital. Offering visitors visual clues as to the care and quality of experience they can expect to receive, through stimulating exhibition and transformational performance.</p>
<p>The arts programme offers access to experience and engagement for patients beyond clinical care supporting mood, well being and community engagement. The arts is a tool for sharing and collecting information, delivered in partnership with clinical staff it can also be a method for engaging patients more deeply in activity for therapeutic benefit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>“We are so pleased to be taking our first steps in to exhibiting film work at the hospital with Jason and his team. Their sensitivity to the environment, commitment to the cause and bravery to take on this challenge is inspiring.”</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>“We have been speaking with Jason for some time as to how his unique approach to film could benefit the patient experience at Derby Hospitals. The decision to show the work on screens in a series of pop up locations all over the hospital will allow the greatest possible access to the work for all sorts of patients and visitors. From the fracture clinic and X-ray to cancer services and clinical measurement thousands of visitors will get opportunity to see the work each day it is shown.”</em></p>

<p><strong>MY VISION – THE SUPERNOVA</strong></p>
<p>For me, film and most art is all about escapism. Escapism into a world created by the individual or group of artists. Whether that be through film, music, performance or a combination of many, the main goal must be to create something that transports the viewer from their day to day surroundings to a place of beauty, light and visual poetry.</p>
<p>Within this project I am looking to reflect upon my influence from a Supernova, which is the explosion of a dying star and the creation of a nebula. The amazing colour, depth and vibrancy created within these nebula's is what I will be trying to re-create, following the narrative of reality. Although there will be no spoken words, characters representing different chemicals and reactions will take us through the journey of the star and how it creates new life.</p>
<p>Another of my passions is dance. I love the immersive quality that many dance styles can have, and that you can get lost within the movement of another. Renowned professional performers from Deda will be using a variety of different styles to portray their character. From ballet to contemporary, each style will be specifically designed around the characteristics they are trying to portray.</p>
<p>Music will be composed especially for this piece, adding to the epic, dramatic and powerful nature of the journey.</p>
<p>I aim to transport the viewer to a place where they can witness this natural phenomenon, escaping from their own busy narrative to a place of beauty and relaxation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p>Power, passion, attraction, the evolution and growth of movement; that is what <em>flourish</em> will explore.  A journey will be taken by our performers, <em>developing on their animalistic a</em>nd natural emotions, along with the depth and texture of their surroundings. They will reflect upon one of the most simple yet powerful flourishes, the explosion of a star to the creation of a nebula.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Within a warmth of colour, light and movement, the path of this piece will take influence from the beauty of reality and combine to create something that will move worlds.</p>

<p>-       Filming Equipment – Lights, cameras, lens’, glide cam, track, jib arm etc.</p>
<p>-       Project equipment – Powdered paint, inks, smoke machines, set building materials, flares, dry ice etc.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>OUR BUDGETARY GOALS</strong></p>
<p>I love the idea that thought provoking, beautiful and high quality films can be made by people from any background, whatever the budget. Myself and the crew have great experience in making every penny count, and in this project especially every penny will be accounted for, whether that be for equipment, skills or coffee to keep us going, we will be stretching the budget as far as we can to produce something equivalent to the standard of a budget ten times what we are aiming for.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our minimum goal we must reach to make this film possible is</strong> <strong>£6,000</strong></p>
<p>This is just enough to cover the costs for basic equipment hire, general expenses and getting most of the crew to “do me a favour”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our extended goal is</strong> <strong>£9,000</strong></p>
<p>This will allow us to spend more time developing the idea, which includes hiring Quad’s Chocolate Factory. Having access to this space will give us a multitude of scope for the project to grow but also for all artists involved, as they will gain access to the space along with myself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our optimum goal is £12,000</strong></p>
<p>Cinema quality equipment, all the space we need and room to experiment and develop the idea so that all artists can contribute fully to it’s professional quality and effectiveness as a tool for health care.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our dream goal is £15,000</strong></p>
<p>Not only will we be able to achieve all of the above, but this added budget will enable the project to be developed into the future with Air Arts and other national health care organisations. The use of this piece as a tool for engagement toward well being for many thousands of patients is a dream. This goal will enable us to begin that journey.</p>

<p>Art Relief International is a volunteer program therefore I will not be receiving any financial support during my three-month placement in Chiang Mai. I will also need to fund my flight to and from Chiang Mai, visa, and vaccinations independently. As is the case with most volunteer-based organizations, there are also fees associated with the program. These fees cover the cost of registration, a donation to the host organization, pre-trip orientation materials, travel health insurance, in-country orientation and city tour, in-country transportation to and from placement, accommodation, food, Thai language training, in-country staff support, and 24-hour emergency assistance.</p>

I have a PhD in Biology, but I have found my passion in art and I specialize in capturing some of the ephemeral art forms of India on permanent surfaces. I started painting textured artworks towards the end of 2011 and have been showing my works in and around Madison since February 2012. I have been showing in smaller venues like coffee shops and restaurants and participating in arts &amp; crafts fairs. Along with these events and direct marketing I have sold more than 100 original paintings at an affordable price in the last couple of years. I have also used the proceeds from the sale of my paintings to support various community non-profits and also regularly donate artwork for fundraising events.</p>
<p>For the next year, I want to take my artwork to more people and reach collectors through popular art festivals. Textured paintings that I create in the style of henna body art are unique and capture the colors and patterns that are part of everyday life in India. By going to professional art festivals, I will also be able to create awareness of ethnic art forms. </p>
<p>By contributing to my campaign, you will help me upgrade my booth set up which is much needed, even to qualify for these art festivals. (Photo under gallery on what the upgraded set up will look like)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>I am looking for $2000 minimum in donations to help with the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Flourish Mesh Display Panels - $700</li>
<li>EZ UP Canopy 10'x10' tent with awning and sidewalls- $500</li>
<li>Weight Bags, pack of four - $70</li>
<li>Printed Name Banner - $50</li>
<li>Spinner Rack for Notecards - $90</li>
<li>Canvas Print Bins - $60</li>
<li>Booth Fee for one Art Festival - $500</li>
</ul>
<p>I am looking to participate in at least 20 art festivals in 2014 and on average the booth fees are about $400 for each show. Jury fees for each one is $50 on average. I will also need to triple my inventory of paintings before my first show and I will be saving up for these fees and cost of materials. Hence I need your support for helping me getting the required set up. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Any funds collected in excess of my asking amount will go towards jury fees, printing of promotional materials for the show and I can always use more paint. If I don't reach my funding goal, whatever money raised will go towards getting the tent and mesh panels.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>I cannot thank you enough for your support and in return for your contribution you will get one of the following: notecards, limited edition prints, a private henna party, custom crocheted scarfs (both for men and women), hand painted lazy Susan, hand painted plate  and original artworks on canvas! You also have the option of just contributing without choosing any perks or send your perk as a gift to someone. Samples of perks are posted in the Gallery.</span></span></span></span></span><p></p>

<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution in helping me go pro will be valuable in making my art visible to hundreds of thousands of people. For example, Madison's Art Fair on the Square attract 100,000 visitors over the weekend compared to about 3000 people for the neighborhood art and craft markets. Making it to juried art festivals will also help me take the next step in my art career by getting into galleries.</p>

</h1>
<p style=""font-family: georgia;""><font size=""3"">Last summer I traveled to
West Virginia and witnessed the mining practice called Mountaintop 
Removal. While
there, I spoke with residents who have lived in the mountains their 
whole lives,
as have their ancestors. They told me how the coal companies have 
systematically, and many times illegally,
taken their lands and turned them into barren fields where nothing 
grows. There is no potable water in the coalfields, so if it can be 
afforded, city water
is brought up in barrels or if not, the residents drink water that is 
tainted
with mercury and arsenic among other toxins from coal processing and 
mine
drainage. There are extremely high rates of birth defects and cancer in
Appalachia; numbers the coal companies refute and have even insinuated 
are due
to inbreeding. Many residents feel that as the mountains are destroyed 
around them and their requests for help from their elected officials are ignored or demeaned that their very sense of identity is being lost.</font></p>

 people I
spoke to feel helpless to stand up against King Coal and a corrupt state
government. Others are fighting as hard as they possibly can. Some stage

in West Virginia made it difficult for me to believe that I was
 still in a first world country. Most residents of West Virgina
 are not against coal mining completely. In fact many of them are or were miners and
 come from mining families. What they want is at minimum a return to safe 
underground mining and the jobs it provides and a sustainable future.</font></p>

mines from the ground and from the air juxtaposed with video portraits of
activists, local residents, miners and coal company officials. These images
reflect the conflicting realities of life in West Virginia: the
lushness of the landscape and the desolation of the mines. My goal is to create
a work that presents no single agenda other than exposing the complex issues
surrounding energy production in the United States.</font></p>

Wir sind Berlin Rhizom 明天麻, eine internationale Gruppe aus zehn aufstrebenden KünstlerInnen von verschiedenen sozialen, künstlerischen und kulturellen Backgrounds. In Wittenberg werden ir mit der KulturBotschaft kooperieren. Einer ortsansässigen Stiftung, der es genau wie uns am Herzen liegt alternative künstlerische Ausdrucksformen in eine alter deutsche Stadt zu bringen.</span></p><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Wir arbeiten mit allen Arten von Materialien und Techniken und kombinieren verschiedenen Disziplinen wie Performance, Theaterdesign, aber auch Zeichnungen, Installationen und Konzeptkunst, um eine einzigartige künstlerische Synergie zu erzeugen. Als Gruppe mit Mitgliedern von drei verschiedenen Kontinenten liegt unser inhaltliches Interesse vor allem in Fragen der transkulturellen Kommunikation, Sprache, Übersetzung und Gemeinschaft. Im Rahmen der Ausstellung werden jedoch auch andere Themen berührt werden, inklusive des berühmten Namensgebers der Lutherstadt Wittenberg und religiösen Reformators Martin Luther.</span><br/>
</div><p>Wir werden bereits vom Land Sachsen-Anhalt mit 5000Euro gefördert. Leider fehlen uns noch 1.300Euro, außerdem müssen wir gegenüber dem Land einen Eigenbetrag ausweisen, um die Förderung überhaupt zu bekommen.</p><p>Wenn wir unser Ziel von 1.300€ erreichen wird es ein vierwöchiges open studio mit allen KünstlerInnen in den Räumen der KulturBotschaft, workshops und eine dreitägige Vernissage, gefolgt von einer längeren Ausstellungsperiode in Wittenberg geben. Wenn wir unser Ziel nicht erreichen, werden wir trotzdem versuchen irgendetwas auf die Beine zu stellen. Wir freuen uns über jeden Beitrag, wir freuen uns aber genauso, wenn Ihr uns in Wittenberg besuchen kommt oder uns auf Facebook folgt.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<p><span>We want to raise 1.300€ to create an ambitious art exhibition in the Lutherstadt Wittenberg. We are an international group of ten upcoming artists from all kinds of artistic, social and cultural backgrounds. In Wittenberg we will cooperate with the KulturBotschaft, a local foundation who is just like us interested in bringing alternative artistic ways of expression to a old German town.</span></p><p>We work with all types of materials and techniques and combine different disciplines, from performance and theater design, to drawings, installations and conceptual art, creating a unique synergy. Being a group with members from all over the world our main interest lies in the question of transcultural communication, language, translation and community. But others topics will be touched, including the famous religious reformer Martin Luther.</p>
We are being funded by the state Sachsen-Anhalt with 5000Euro. Unfortunately we still need 1.300Euro. <div>
<br/><p>If we reach our goal there will be a four week open studio with ten artists in the KulturBotschaft, workshops and a three day opening with performances, followed by a four week exhibition. If we can’t reach our goal we will try to make something happen nonetheless. We are happy about every contribution, but we are also happy if you visit us in Wittenberg or just follow us on Facebook </p>

</div></div>","Wir brauchen Eure Hilfe um ein ambitioniertes Ausstellungsprojekt in der Lutherstadt zu realisieren. Wir sind Berlin Rhizom 明天麻, eine internationale Gruppe aus zehn aufstrebenden KünstlerInnen von verschiedenen sozialen, künstlerischen und kulturellen Backgrounds. In Wittenberg werden ir mit der KulturBotschaft kooperieren. Einer ortsansässigen Stiftung, der es genau wie uns am Herzen liegt alternative künstlerische Ausdrucksformen in eine alter deutsche Stadt zu bringen.
Wir arbeiten mit allen Arten von Materialien und Techniken und kombinieren verschiedenen Disziplinen wie Performance, Theaterdesign, aber auch Zeichnungen, Installationen und Konzeptkunst, um eine einzigartige künstlerische Synergie zu erzeugen. Als Gruppe mit Mitgliedern von drei verschiedenen Kontinenten liegt unser inhaltliches Interesse vor allem in Fragen der transkulturellen Kommunikation, Sprache, Übersetzung und Gemeinschaft. Im Rahmen der Ausstellung werden jedoch auch andere Themen berührt werden, inklusive des berühmten Namensgebers der Lutherstadt Wittenberg und religiösen Reformators Martin Luther.
Wir werden bereits vom Land Sachsen-Anhalt mit 5000Euro gefördert. Leider fehlen uns noch 1.300Euro, außerdem müssen wir gegenüber dem Land einen Eigenbetrag ausweisen, um die Förderung überhaupt zu bekommen.Wenn wir unser Ziel von 1.300€ erreichen wird es ein vierwöchiges open studio mit allen KünstlerInnen in den Räumen der KulturBotschaft, workshops und eine dreitägige Vernissage, gefolgt von einer längeren Ausstellungsperiode in Wittenberg geben. Wenn wir unser Ziel nicht erreichen, werden wir trotzdem versuchen irgendetwas auf die Beine zu stellen. Wir freuen uns über jeden Beitrag, wir freuen uns aber genauso, wenn Ihr uns in Wittenberg besuchen kommt oder uns auf Facebook folgt.  
We want to raise 1.300€ to create an ambitious art exhibition in the Lutherstadt Wittenberg. We are an international group of ten upcoming artists from all kinds of artistic, social and cultural backgrounds. In Wittenberg we will cooperate with the KulturBotschaft, a local foundation who is just like us interested in bringing alternative artistic ways of expression to a old German town.We work with all types of materials and techniques and combine different disciplines, from performance and theater design, to drawings, installations and conceptual art, creating a unique synergy. Being a group with members from all over the world our main interest lies in the question of transcultural communication, language, translation and community. But others topics will be touched, including the famous religious reformer Martin Luther.
We are being funded by the state Sachsen-Anhalt with 5000Euro. Unfortunately we still need 1.300Euro. 
If we reach our goal there will be a four week open studio with ten artists in the KulturBotschaft, workshops and a three day opening with performances, followed by a four week exhibition. If we can’t reach our goal we will try to make something happen nonetheless. We are happy about every contribution, but we are also happy if you visit us in Wittenberg or just follow us on Facebook
