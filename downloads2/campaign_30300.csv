Equipped with a 9-axis IMU, its joint position sensor and electric current sensor is able to reflect to its own posture and joint rotation angle and torque, which are used for algorithms verification and exploitation, and can be programmed by computer to alert poison words and python programming. It is designed for education, research, algorithm verification, and entertainment.
 

 

 
XGO-Mini has fully functional AI modules which can facilitate both entry and advanced-level AI applications. The Al modules come with the features of visual recognition, voice recognition, and gesture recognition giving XGO-Mini the ability to hear, recognize and reply to users like a real dog. It also can track multiple colors and recognize QR codes, April Tag, and DataMatrix, etc. Through different programming, it can achieve more functions beyond your imagination.
 

 
Mask Detection
 

 
Gesture Recognition
 
 Object Analysis
 

 
AI Chip
XGO-Mini’s AI module has a built-in Kendryte K210 Chip, featuring RISC-V processor architecture, audio-visual, standalone IP core, and strong programmability. It supports images, audio, video, machine learning models, and other types of materials stored in a Micro SD card.
 
 
 
XGO Team has collaborated with Canaan by using its Kendryte K210 Chip, the most powerful edge computing chip, designs for both visual and semantic recognition, widely used in various scenarios. Canaan is a leading provider of supercomputing solutions, distinguished for superior cost-efficiencies and performance.
 

 
12 Degrees of Freedom
 

 
Based on inverse kinematics, XGO-Mini’s 12 active joints enable it to move forward, backward, left, and right and support omnidirectional movement and the superposition of motion in multiple directions.   More about the joints 
 

 
 XGO-Mini, as a quadruped robot, can mimic the motion of a dog walking and has certain advantages like walking on uneven terrain and extremely rough surfaces. It can even adapt to avoid obstacles by adjusting its height. With its unique bionic system, XGO Mini can perform any dynamic movement.
 

 
XGO’s joints are composed of DC motors, reduction gears, sensors, and control circuits, with a servo control PID algorithm system. Subverts the traditional steering gear without closed-loop function, 360° angle controllable, angle recognition accuracy 0.088 degrees, with built-in acceleration, start and stop function, making mechanized actions smooth and realistic (Design By Luwu Intelligence, Made By Feetech)
 
 Self-stabilization 
 

 
Built-in IMUs capture XGO-Mini movement data and generate a highly flexible & stable motion performance. Through the posture data obtained by the IMU, closed-loop control allows XGO-Mini to adapt to external forces, adjust to the target posture of the manual action, and enable the teaching function.
 

 
When its feet are not moving, the motion control of six degrees of freedom of the body can be actualized. It has unprecedented mobility which coordinates all instinctive and sophisticated movements.
 

 


 


 

 


 
One-button Design
 

 
XGO-Mini comes as an assembled kit, so it's ready to be used. With its one-button design and exclusive app, you can interact with XGO-Mini right away with ease. With the Edge Computing Chip, AI can run on local systems and can be controlled without the Internet and mobile.
 

 
App Control
 

 

 
 Open-source and DIY Your XGO-Mini 
 

 
XGO-Mini allows users to program it with Python and we also supply ROS packages run on Ubuntu or Raspberry for developers. Everyone can create their own functions for XGO-Mini for education, entertainment, and commercial use. Unlimited programming possibilities help you to explore, learn, and have fun.  If XGO-Mini is not enough for you, we will provide you an advanced version, XGO-Ultra.

Turning consumers into creatorsMobile phones are revolutionary. They’ve changed and shaped the life of a modern man like nothing else. Everybody has one and daily activities without this tiny black “brick” are unthinkable for most of us.Despite their presence little does an average person know what’s inside this magical device.With MAKERphone we’re trying to show people that every machine you see was designed by a human being not different nor smarter than themselves.MAKERphone is actually an educational device disguised in the shape of a mobile phone.Our main goal is turning consumers into creators.MAKERphone steps up the gameWe’ve learned A LOT from manufacturing and shipping over 6000 MAKERbuino kits in the past year and here’s a short list of most notable changes and improvements that we’ve implemented in MAKERphone:
 A color screen
Better microcontroller with our custom software
Python programming language compatibility
Scratch programming language compatibility
Dedicated DAC and electronic volume controller for sound regulation and mp3 playback 
8 individually programmable RGB LEDs for a lightshow in your palms
Better PCB architecture for easier soldering
New prettier box with a black touchy cut-out sponge (IMPORTANT!)
The thing can now make calls, has a SIM card, and built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
RTC (real time clock) - MAKERphone now keeps time and wakes you up!
4G or not to 4G?MAKERphone used to come in two variants - 2G and 4G.We have decided to discontinue the 2G version as there was a lot of confusion about the difference between the 2G and the 4G version of the phone.All MAKERphones bought after 19th April 2019 support 4G networks and come preconfigured for your region’s network.How is MAKERphone 4G different?MAKERphone 4G is a version of MAKERphone with a 4G chipset (SIM7600) instead of a 2G GSM chipset (SIM800) that’s included on the standard MAKERphone. The other aspects of MAKERphone will work similarly on both models.MAKERphone teaches you about wires and chips (a.k.a. “hardware”)MAKERphone is hardware. MAKERphone is wires. MAKERphone is chips. MAKERphone is education.MAKERphone runs on electricity and has the same components as your smartphone.It comes in a kit form (not assembled) - you get a box with all the electronic components necessary for building your own fully working mobile phone.You’ll need two things to build your MAKERphone:1) some basic tools2) passion and interest in technologyMAKERphone is FUNWe’re living in the 21st century when kids are not only playing Fortnite. They are building their own electronic devices in their garages #badass #supersmart There’s internet, open-source code and wires you can buy on the internet. All knowledge is a few clicks away and you just need the willpower to start learning and doing something new!Try building your own mobile phone, you'll see how much fun it is!MAKERphone needs toolsMAKERphone teaches you REAL electronics, it’s not like those wanna-be Lego-like electronics kits.hus, you'll need some REAL tools and equipment for assembling your MAKERphone:
A regular soldering iron (nothing super expensive)
Some solder
Diagonal cutter pliers
A regular screwdriver
A piece of insulating tape
If you're a maker, you probably already have these tools.If you're a maker-to-be and still don't have these tools, don't worry as we've got you covered.We've prepped a special version of the MAKERphone kit that already comes with the required tools.Check out the rewards section (at the bottom of the listing) for more info about the available kit versions.Who is this kit for?Based on our experience, an 11-year-old kid should be able to assemble their own MAKERphone with a tiny bit of help from an adult. Therefore, the estimated age group is 11+. Estimated hardware build time: 7 hours. Build time varies and depends on the skills of the person and if the person has ever soldered before.Estimated play time: unlimitedEstimated software development and learning time: unlimitedBuilding the MAKERphone is just the beginning. After that you'll spend numerous hours creating your own games, apps, learning about software, and experimenting with hardware.What's in the kit?

MAKERphone circuit board - the main board that connects all the components in a uniform device that can work as a mobile phone 

MAKERphone casing - multiple sheets of acrylic cut with the power of lasers. They protect the innards and give MAKERphone this sleek look 

128*160 full-color TFT LCD - for playing games, displaying phone numbers and everything in between 

GSM module - a tiny module responsible for everything related to calling and texting other people 

Main microcomputer module - a dual-core processor with built-in Wi-Fi, BLE, and a charging circuit 

Sound module - a board with a DAC (digital to analog converter) chip and a headphone jack for music playback (responsible for ringtones, alarms, game sound effects) 

Amplifier module - makes loud buzzes, bleeps and bloops 

Stick-on antenna - for superb phone signal (a.k.a. send text messages while in the bathroom) 
A bag with other tiny electronic components such as pushbuttons and colored button caps with a 128MB SD card preloaded with games and apps included
What’s in the tools pack?If you choose a perk with a tools pack included, you’ll get this neat wooden box filled with all the essential tools needed for  MAKERphone assembly:

USB soldering iron (lightweight and portable, solder on the go!) 

Metal soldering iron stand 

USB cable for the soldering iron 

Screwdriver   

USB power brick for powering your soldering iron 

Some solder

MAKERphone teaches you PythonPython Is Everywhere.Python is and has been for a while one of the world's most popular programming languages.Every day, without realizing it, you probably use software that is written in Python and big companies use it to write all sorts of useful applications.Python is easy to learn, intuitive, pleasing to the eye and comes with a plethora of libraries.In fact, Python’s creator Guido van Rossum said that he wants to make computer programming accessible to everybody.The best thing - you can code your own apps and games for MAKERphone using Python!MAKERphone runs a special version of python called MicroPython - which has all the basic functions with some specific ones that we’ve defined in order to help you control your MAKERphone’s hardware.Python is a type of programming language that’s not compiled but instead interpreted by the device in real time.Despite that, we’ve designed special code snippets that will “freeze” your Python code and generate an executable file that can be placed on your MAEKRphone’s SD card!MAKERphone teaches you ScratchScratch is a revolutionary program that makes it easy for kids as young as 5 to learn how to code with a simple drag-and-drop system of programming.It already is one of the most popular programming tools for schools.An awesome project called Whitecat IDE made it possible to control MAKERphone’s hardware with ease! It’s an open-source online tool that allows you to create code in a Scratch-like environment.If you’ve never coded before, this is the way to go. Scratch’s intuitive design will let you code your first MAKERphone app in mere minutes!MAKERphone loves ArduinoYES, we love Arduino!Oh, Arduino, you’ve taught us to code and we’ve delved into the word of electronics thanks to your board. This product and our company was made possible thanks to Arduino’s open-sourcefulness and community.Albert: “If Arduino was a lady, I’d take her to a fine dinner… with my GF’s permission, of course!”Therefore, MAKERphone is based on Arduino-compatible ESP32 microcontroller and can be programmed in Arduino IDE (based on C/C++) - the most popular programming environment for makers and hardware enthusiasts.MAKERphone is compatible with numerous Arduino related examples of manipulating various hardware and software components. In fact, it's compatible with most Arduino software libraries available online and will work with many Arduino shields and modules with minimal or no library code modifications.MAKERphone takes you from Padawan to Jedi MasterYou’ve never coded before? You also don’t know a thing about hardware? Absolutely no problemo as MAKERphone will take you from learning how to wield a soldering iron through assembling your very own fully functional mobile phone all the way to coding your very own app or game for your very own DIY mobile phone.We’ve segmented the learning process into levels (like in a video game):MAKERphone does games and appsMAKERphone comes with a 128MB SD card preinstalled with dozens of useful applications, tools and games.It comes with all the basic mobile phone-ish apps such as contacts, SMS, phone dialer, music player, as well as a collection of neat GameBoy-inspired games. MAKERphone is MAKERbuino-compatibleMAKERbuino games can be played on MAKERphone and they’re in full color this time!MAKE your own apps and games!YES! MAKERphone is DIY in its every aspect. Assemble the bits and pieces together in order to create a fully functional phone and get down to coding your own games and apps.Our comprehensive tutorials will lead you through every step of your creative process.There are three main ways to create a game/app for your MAKERphone:

Scratch! A.k.a. colorful blocks that you drag and drop together in order to make your first app. 

Python! Use one of the most popular programming languages used in almost every educational institution or school that teaches people coding.  

Arduino (C/C++)The most popular programming platform for makers and DIY-ers is MAKERphone-compatible and we like it a lot.
After coding your app, you can compile it to an “executable” binary file and put it on your MAKERphone’s SD card.Apps located on the SD card are accessed through MAKERphone’s main menu via the “Apps” icon.We’ve coded a programming library with sets of commands that let you easily:
develop in-app menus and other GUI-related content
play and develop sound FX and background music
draw, display, and animate bitmaps
control MAKERphone’s hardware (i.e. make calls, read files from SD card, flash LEDs)
 CircuitMess world is a place for MAKERphone users to share their creations, exchange knowledge, and download programs made by others as well as a collection of tutorials, guides, and MAKERphone-related documentation.Every game or app in CircuitMess world is open-source and available with a downloadable source code along with a compiled binary file that you can load directly on your device’s SD card.To put it simply, you can take a look at the code of every MAKERphone compatible game or app, learn something new, change the code and implement parts of the code in your own project.Our tutorials collection consists of two main parts:

Official tutorials and guides written by the MAKERphone team

Let me tell you a story of CircuitMess and MAKERbuino.CircuitMess is a technology startup founded a year and a half ago after a successful Kickstarter campaign for MAKERbuino (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/albertgajsak/makerbuino-a-diy-game-console). The name of our startup stems from two words:Circuit (we make electronic circuits) + Mess (our company is a mess) After successfully delivering MAKERbuino, we were collecting feedback from thousands of users and have started thinking about our next big step.An idea of a DIY mobile phone came in and we had so much fun brainstorming, developing and goofing around whilst preparing this amazing product and this exciting campaign :)Thank you!Our company was founded over a year ago thanks to generous Kickstarter supporters just like you.As a result of your help, our lives have changed and our hobbies turned into full-time jobs.This wonderful experience allowed us to spread positive influence, open jobs and learn A LOT.This shaped and defined us as people that we are today. MAKERphone has a “gang”This whole story was started by Albert, his brother, and a few friends back when he was in high school.They were all working on it after school/work as much as they could.Since then, a lot has changed.We've rented a real workplace and started employing people (job interviews yay!).CircuitMess has grown to 7 full-time employees and a few part-timers and we've successfully converted this small hype-driven business into a self-sustainable startup.Oh, and we have a microwave oven now too! Special thanks to: Matija Fućek, Tena Marčac, Degordian, Miron Bedić, Bruno Staroveški, Matea Tepić, Borna Bedić, Laura Rožić, Emil Gajšak, Antonio Valentić, Fran Božidar Prahić, Ana Car, Tomislav Car, Eric the Dog, Infinum, Luka Travas, Darko Kontin, Flavorific, Mediatoolkit, Bornfight, FabLab Hrvatska, Roberto Vdović.Risks and challengesHaving a hardware startup can sometimes be harsh. Mass production risks are real and we’ve taken every precaution to prepare for them:-MAKERphone uses common, easy to get components that can be easily purchased in large quantities.-Hired workers and helpers will be doing the production of kits at our headquarters. We will directly control the manufacturing process and the quality of the finished kits-We already have certain experience with producing similar kits and a production line set up as we’ve already successfully delivered a total of 6000 MAKERbuino kits sold via Kickstarter, our webshop and more than 25 of our distributors worldwide- We’re a team of hard-working young technology enthusiasts living for what we do and believing in what we live for We promise we'll keep you updated about any issues that may arise. Keep making!",62.0,1,"4 Campaigns

<p>Hi! My name is Virtuous Cornwall, the CEO of my own publishing company Vncbooks LLC.  I am a Christian, a military wife, mother, teacher and author. I enjoy writing and telling stories. I decided to pursue the desire of becoming an author after I had my son in 2018. I was rejected by a traditional publisher.   December of 2019, I published my first book ""FINDING LITTLE DOGGINS"" under the Animalsville Series.  The expense was crucial but with the support of family, friends and love ones I overcame and published the book.  In spite of it all, some great things happened.   Since then I had the privilege of visiting schools and libraries to read and discuss my book, while engaging children in interactive activities.  As a former teacher I enjoy being in the presence of children, as an author I find it fun and exciting to visit children in any settings.  I was invited live on Facebook by Homer Drive Elementary School as their principle Ms. Belinda George, who was featured on the Steve Harvey's show read my book. My book can be found in local libraries and stores in New Jersey. As of March 2020 I provide Story and Activity time live on my Facebook page.  I read and demonstrate child like activities for children. Additionally I also provide remote visit to schools, libraries and churches. My goal is to continue writing stories for children and families.  I believe that stories takes us on teachable journeys to help us better ourselves.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/User:Michael_Chidester"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michael Chidester</a>. I started with HEMA in 2001, and since 2009 I've been working on a project that should be familiar to all of you, the <a href=""http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Main_Page"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wiktenauer</a> (you can blame that name on Jake Norwood). Over the past five years and change we've become the unofficial library of <a href=""http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Treatises"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">historical European martial arts treatises</a> from the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, and we're currently making inroads into the 17th. If you've missed out so far, check out that link before going further.</p>
<p>Maintaining and expanding this project is a volunteer effort that consumes many hundreds of hours a year, both from me and sysadmin Christian Trosclair, but hosting it is also quite expensive—and the costs increase each year. We initially funded it out of pocket, and then in 2011 convinced the HEMA Alliance to cover our costs.</p>
<p>Last year, we decided to try something new and held a <a href=""http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Wiktenauer:Fundraiser"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fundraising drive</a>. I hoped to raise $500 to cover hosting and registration, but the response was overwhelming. Ultimately we raised $3,611.93, over seven times what we asked for. We were completely unprepared for this level of funding, but I quickly started drawing up battle plans.</p>
<p>Where once paying for the digitization of manuscripts and books involved either finding a wealthy benefactor or passing the hat around and convincing HEMA researchers to pool funds, for the first time in 2014 we were able to begin unilaterally commissioning scans and getting permission to host them directly on the wiki.</p>
<p>Our acquisitions over the course of the last year included:</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In addition to our manuscripts acquisitions, funds from last year's drive allowed us to double our server resources. This year we'd like to double them again, and also add other server functionality that Christian assures me is necessary. That's going to come out to about $1500. If we exceed this goal, we lay out what we plan to do in the next section. (Spoiler alert: it ends with purchasing scans of the manuscript that Salvator Fabris prepared for Duke Johan Frederik of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp in 1601.)</p>
<p>To encourage donations, I've talked with a lot of people about what sorts of perks we might offer (since all of the fruits of our labor are typically given away for free). We've come up with a number of ideas, including the following:</p>
<div style=""float: right;"">

</div>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;"">Patches and shirts:</span> We just got a great new logo last month, so it's time we put it to use. John Harmston is playing with designs as we speak.</p>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;"">Digital scans:</span> People often ask for easier ways to download the scans we host on the Wiktenauer, since wikis don't really have easy export options. Choose a funding level with this perk and I will prepare a bundle of scans that you can download (or, if you prefer, I'll send you a DVD). You can request the list of scans that we acquired in 2014 (see above), you can defer your order until we've purchased all of the promised 2015 scans and have them all sent to you in a nice package, or you can order off the menu and receive up to 2 GB of scans from any that are <a href=""http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Image_database"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hosted on the Wiktenauer</a> (or that indicate that they will be hosted in the future).</p>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;"">E-books:</span> The huge compilation tables that you see on Wiktenauer got their start long before the wiki was a twinkle in Ben Michels' eye. I created the first of them in an effort to build the most complete versions of treatises possible for my students to study. To make them easier to work from, I arranged them into study books where each page presented the chief variations of a single play—the training guides that I wished I had but that no one had published (and which still haven't been published to this day).</p>

<p>I will take both of these documents, update them with the current translations on the wiki (including some being prepared specifically for this project) and the superior images available now, check the associations and sequence of the compilation against the current articles, and release them in three PDFs—one of Liechtenauer, two of Fiore (preface, grappling, baton, and dagger in one; sword, axe, spear, and mounted in the other).</p>

<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>If we exceed our initial goal, and I hope we will, then we've lined up ten 
manuscripts that we'd like to purchase in the coming year. (These are all digital scans, except for Pozzo which is scanned from microfilm.) Here they are with their funding thresholds:</p>
<ul>
$1500 - Success! Server costs covered for 2015
<br/>$1600 - The Nuremberg (""Döbringer"") Hausbuch (<a href=""http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Codex_D%C3%B6bringer_%28MS_3227a%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MS. 3227a</a>)

</ul>
$11500 - The Copenhagen manuscript of Salvator Fabris (<a href=""http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Scientia_e_Prattica_dell%27Arme_(GI.kgl.Saml.1868.4040)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ms. GKS 1868/r</a>)
</ul>
<p>These are all important and significant treatises, but the last one is a treasure that all students of Fabris (and anyone who loves manuscripts) would love to see. The presentation copy of his famous book is a beautiful illuminated manuscript fit for a king—though it was, in fact, made for the king's cousin Duke Johan Frederik—and might also contain content not found in the printed version. Unfortunately, the Royal Library is asking a king's ransom to have it scanned, so we have to save it for last. (If we wildly exceed all expectations, the figure they quoted for archival-quality digital scans of the manuscript converts to roughly $16,000.)</p>
<p>We've calculated these numbers to not only cover the cost of the scans, but to also pay for the boons we're offering as well as leaving us some extra funding at the end of the day for other projects (and possibly even more wiggle room if the Euro stays depressed through the end of February, since these figures are based on the currency value at the start of the year); new manuscripts are being discovered all the time and the last thing we want is to have a pivotal treatise come to light only when we've exhausted our funds and can't bring it to the community.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Wiktenauer is a well-established project at this stage and has a proven track record of delivering content to the community. I've personally been organizing the purchase of manuscript scans for the community since I started the Gladiatoria Project in 2008.</p>
<p>The only real risk is that the libraries and museums we've contacted will fail to honor the price quotes they sent us, in which case we might come up short of money on the last purchases.</p>
<p>The other risk is that I could be plowed down by a bus tomorrow or killed in a blizzard in today, but in that case I hope you fine people will carry on the work in my stead.</p> </div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The fundraiser will run for three weeks, until the middle of February. If you don't have money to donate right now, we understand; times are hard all around. You can still help by getting the word out and sending others our way. Post the link everywhere links get posted (like... social media... places), tell the members of your club, share it with your loved ones, and so on.</p>
<p>And above all, keep reading and keep training. The Wiktenauer isn't an end in itself, so whether you donate or not, we hope you're making use of this resource in every way you can think of. HEMA runs on manuals, and we're just here to provide the fuel.

</div>
</div></div>","February Update: With both Fiore books complete, I have decided to also offer them together in one giant (535-page) hardcover volume for the same donation level as both softcovers together ($200). All Fiore books will finally begin shipping this month.November Update: Now that shirts and patches have shipped, most perks granting t-shirts and patches have been disabled to make sure we don't run out. Perks granting books and scans are still available for last-minute orders; the Liechtenauer books are shipping now and the Fiore books will ship by end of year.

Note: We forgot to address international shipping in our perk descriptions, and we can't edit a perk once a donor has claimed it. International donors please add an additional $15 if you select a t-shirt and/or DVD and an extra $30 if you order any print books.
The donation level for the Fiorist perk was mistakenly placed at $250 rather than $275. We will honor the listed price, but we would appreciate it if people selecting that perk added the extra $25 onto their donation.



Short Summary
My name is Michael Chidester. I started with HEMA in 2001, and since 2009 I've been working on a project that should be familiar to all of you, the Wiktenauer (you can blame that name on Jake Norwood). Over the past five years and change we've become the unofficial library of historical European martial arts treatises from the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, and we're currently making inroads into the 17th. If you've missed out so far, check out that link before going further.
Maintaining and expanding this project is a volunteer effort that consumes many hundreds of hours a year, both from me and sysadmin Christian Trosclair, but hosting it is also quite expensive—and the costs increase each year. We initially funded it out of pocket, and then in 2011 convinced the HEMA Alliance to cover our costs.
Last year, we decided to try something new and held a fundraising drive. I hoped to raise $500 to cover hosting and registration, but the response was overwhelming. Ultimately we raised $3,611.93, over seven times what we asked for. We were completely unprepared for this level of funding, but I quickly started drawing up battle plans.
Where once paying for the digitization of manuscripts and books involved either finding a wealthy benefactor or passing the hat around and convincing HEMA researchers to pool funds, for the first time in 2014 we were able to begin unilaterally commissioning scans and getting permission to host them directly on the wiki.
Our acquisitions over the course of the last year included:

The Hans von Speyer Fechtbuch (Ms. M.I.29)
The 1560s Joachim Meyer manuscript (Ms. A.4º.2)
The Solothurner Fechtbuch (Cod. S.554)
The Vienna version of Paulus Hector Mair (Cod. 10825/10826)
Michael Hundt's 
Ein new Kůnstliches Fechtbuch im Rappier

The Vienna version of Paulus Kal (Ms. KK 5126)
The Gotha version of Paulus Kal (Ms. Chart. B. 1021) (partial)
The Wolfenbüttel Sketchbook (Cod. Guelf. 78. 2. Aug. 2º)
Domingo Luis Godinho's ""Do Arte de Esgrima"" (Ms. PBA 58)

This year we're hoping to see an even greater outpouring of support because we have a number of very interesting projects lined up.

What We Need & What You Get
In addition to our manuscripts acquisitions, funds from last year's drive allowed us to double our server resources. This year we'd like to double them again, and also add other server functionality that Christian assures me is necessary. That's going to come out to about $1500.

Patches and shirts: We just got a great new logo last month, so it's time we put it to use. John Harmston is playing with designs as we speak.
Digital scans: People often ask for easier ways to download the scans we host on the Wiktenauer, since wikis don't really have easy export options. Choose a funding level with this perk and I will prepare a bundle of scans that you can download (or, if you prefer, I'll send you a DVD).

In this way, it offers the most complete perspective possible on the tradition of Johannes Liechtenauer as it was recorded in the mid 15th century.""

The Fiore books are 282 and 288 pages long (respectively) and include translations by Kendra Brown, Michael Chidester, Rebecca Garber, Colin Hatcher, and Guy Windsor—including the first-ever English translation of the Paris manuscript. Here is the description from the book jacket:""Drawing on the manuscript scans, transcriptions, and translations hosted by Wiktenauer, this book offers the first ever compilation of the four known copies of the treatise of Fiore de'i Liberi.

Which is one year after the pre-order campaign. This date is based on commitments we have made with our manufacturer. It will give us enough time to make sure that Leka works as smoothly as possible, is solid enough for your child, and meets all the legal & regulatory requirements. Leka is an interactive and multi-sensory smart toy, offering children with special needs the ability to play fun and educational games that motivates social interactions, that increase motor, cognitive, and emotional skills, as well as stimulates autonomy.Based on papers published in peer reviewed sources, Leka has been developed hand-in-hand with parents, therapists and caregivers, to aid in a variety of settings. From the office, to schools, to home, Leka is making therapy easier, more efficient, and more accessible. FEATURESAs a robotic toy, Leka is a child’s perfect companion and friend. EQUIPPED WITH SENSORSLeka can detect and respond to a child’s interaction through autonomous behaviors. Interactive responses aim to help children better understand social cues and improve their social skills. PREDICTABLE IN ITS INTERACTIONS (meaning, each and all of its interactions are pre-programmed)Leka give children a sense of safety and peace of mindA WIDE RANGE OF STIMULATIONS, FINELY CUSTOMIZABLEEven children with restrictive areas of interest will find their own source of motivation.Because each child is unique, we made Leka's stimulations and applications finely customizable to be able to adapt to a child’s individual needs for engagement and motivation and to advance alongside each child’s progress. With Leka, there is finally a resource for parents who want to complement existing therapies and foster family harmony with parents and siblings through multiplayer games, both at school and at home.LEKA'S BENEFITLeka is focused on making social interaction easier with the child's family and surroundings through multiplayer games as well as reducing anxiety and stress.   Leka motivates and guides the child throughout the day to autonomously complete different daily tasks through pictograms displayed on its screen and vocal instructions. Leka helps parents, caregivers and therapists teach motor, cognitive, and emotional skills through play. Integrating Leka at home and in school will then help parents and therapists to stay connected. 


Besides Leka's interactive responses, we are developing educational applications targeting the specific needs of children such as motor, cognitive, social, and emotional disorders. These applications can be used as: 

MULTIPLAYER ACTIVITIES – used with parents, therapists, and siblings to motivate social interactions and foster family harmony.
AUTONOMOUS ACTIVITIES – used to help a child play on his or her own, building a sense of independence, and control over emotions, frustration, and anxiety.

Within each application users will be able to customize the level of difficulty of the application and to modify the guidance level, or how much instructions Leka needs to provide the child with in order to complete the game. 
These games engage children and give them the opportunity to play and learn at the same time.











Leka’s power lies in its ability to motivate children. This is why Leka will offer 3 autonomy-building apps such as Time-Timer, Alarm Clock, and Nightlight, common assistance tools for special needs children, making children and parent’s lives easier!

[Coming in 2018]
To help parents, therapists, and caregivers work as a team towards faster progress. Leka will provide data on how the children interact with the device and allows parents to follow their children’s progress.
For example, when analyzing the raw data generated through the interaction of the child with the robot, we can understand what kind of guidance is more helpful to the child to allow him to complete the task. All of this information is displayed in graphs on the tracking tab of the monitoring platform.
From this shared interface, parents, therapists, and caregivers can communicate with each other about things like assigning homework or sharing notes on a child’s use and progress.
 
With this monitoring platform Leka can offer a more consistent therapy and let children achieve faster progress.

 



 
RESEARCH-BASED & USER-CENTRIC DESIGNED

 

Years of research on social robotics and developmental psychology has shown the learning potential of robots for children with Autism. We have built our features based on what has been demonstrated in this field.
Subsequently, through our tests we realized this technology is not only beneficial for children with autism, but could also be an adaptable learning tool for many other children with developmental disorders.

Leka is aligned with research-based developmental milestones. Our educational applications are designed through qualitative studies, direct observation of children using Leka, and has been validated by the French Advisory & Scientific Board, an organization composed of some of France’s top researchers, therapists, caregivers, entrepreneurs and organization executives.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In the Spring of 2020, after the closure of our son's childcare program, Ali decided to stay home with our son, Shamus, while Mary worked from home. To bring in some additional income, Ali began nannying several local children as needed. As word spread of this, it became clear that there is a need for quality childcare for infants and toddlers in the Peterborough, NH area. With Mary's certificate in Early Childhood Education and experience working with infants and toddlers in a Waldorf-inspired childcare, and Ali's love of cooking, gardening, and the outdoors, we felt drawn to fill this need for our community.</p>
<p>To this end, we plan to start up our own licensed childcare center serving Peterborough and surrounding towns, providing care for children ages 6 months to 3 years. The Little Blue House Home Childcare Center will be a Waldorf-inspired program with a strong emphasis on nature and play-based learning.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are looking for financial support to cover our start up costs. Childcare centers are often not profitable businesses, so it is important to us to receive community support in this venture. Starting a licensed childcare center requires inspections, fees, equipment, further education and trainings, and more. Your contribution will help in so many ways, but here are some of the things you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional outdoor fencing</li>
<li>Highchairs, nap mats, cribs, changing table, and other equipment</li>
<li>CPR and first aid training</li>
<li>Waldorf education trainings</li>

<p>Kami Senang Membaca! We love to read!</p>
<p>Envision a space that inspires young children to become excited about reading -  freshly painted walls, a comfortable seating area, and shelves lined with engaging books for children to get lost in. With this vision in mind, the library at SD1, the public elementary school on Gili Air, could use your help! SD1 serves about 200 students from class 1-6 (ages 7-12). The school itself hasn’t changed much in 30 years and a library renovation is just what they need to bring new educational energy to their learning environment. So, together with the Kapala Desa and teachers from the school, we are working on a project to transform the current library space into a place that supports literacy as well as other learning activities. </p>
<p>To achieve this, we need paint supplies, two strong fans, an air conditioning unit, a large carpet, and a comfortable sofa. We are also working with locals to build custom furniture that meets the needs of the students and teachers to fully utilize the space.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, we are accepting book donations of high quality English texts and collecting cash donations to purchase books at the appropriate levels. </p>
<p>We project that the materials and furniture costs will be  $1000.  All cash donations above and beyond that will be used to purchase books and materials to make the space a vibrant learning environment. </p>
<p>Please consider making a donation today and know that the entirety of your generous gift will support the beautiful children of Gili Air and give the community a place to come together for educational events. Terima kasih!</p>

So, together with the Kapala Desa and teachers from the school, we are working on a project to transform the current library space into a place that supports literacy as well as other learning activities. 
To achieve this, we need paint supplies, two strong fans, an air conditioning unit, a large carpet, and a comfortable sofa. We are also working with locals to build custom furniture that meets the needs of the students and teachers to fully utilize the space.
Simultaneously, we are accepting book donations of high quality English texts and collecting cash donations to purchase books at the appropriate levels. 
We project that the materials and furniture costs will be  $1000.  All cash donations above and beyond that will be used to purchase books and materials to make the space a vibrant learning environment. 
Please consider making a donation today and know that the entirety of your generous gift will support the beautiful children of Gili Air and give the community a place to come together for educational events. Terima kasih!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Hello from Studio Gnome!</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I'm a professional artist, grades 6-12 public school art teacher, and creative play advocate for youth and adults alike. At the age of 38, I've arrived at a point in my career where I would like to share the depths of my experiential wisdom with a wider audience. (You can find my resume at </span><a href=""http://www.studiognome.com/resume"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"" target=""_blank"">www.studiognome.com/resume</a><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">)</span></p>
<p>My philosophy as a professional ‘play coach’ is to <i>gently encourage and guide </i>participants into open-ended opportunities of playful <i>self nurturing </i>through practices of observation and response with themselves and the world around them. Designed to relax the logical mind, these creative practices open up a wider sense of curiosity for creative discovery; similar to the mind of a child who sensitively experiments with surrounding stimuli, promoting sensory awareness. A practice in creative play build new habits of mindfulness that include a relaxed approach to our more ‘serious’ daily responsibilities. These new habits recondition the mind to approach our daily problem-solving tasks with more joyful interest and imaginative responses!</p>
<p>“Imagination is more important than knowledge.” - Albert Einstein</p>
<p>What a powerful perspective by one of humanity's great minds--to solve life’s challenges with confidence in <i>the power of the mind's imagination</i>.</p>
<p>The question becomes: <strong>Are we continuing to <i>exercise and nurture the Imagination? </i></strong></p>
<p>Studio Gnome classes intend to foster creative exercises that <i>break through</i> our habitual perceptions of ‘right way’ versus ‘wrong way’ of doing things, and instead to <i>play </i>with refreshing ways of experiencing the mind-body connection, a world as infinitely vast as the universe itself!</p>
<p>Our creative capacities shape perception and the experience of life itself, with the power to transform feelings and how we move through the world. In every moment the act of 'becoming' exists, the freedom to learn new possibilities or re-learn forgotten ones. Creative confidence allows an individual to feel more in control. When facing the pressure of a deadline, for instance, learned practices of <i>creative play</i> can rescue us from chronic procrastination, and its inevitable downward spiral of anxiety.</p>
<p>We have a choice. To foster mindsets that are ready to adapt to the unexpected situations and moments life throws at us or not. A regular practice in <i>creative play</i>  prepares us.</p>
<p>Studio Gnome's <i>creative play</i> class methodology hopes to contribute in its own way to a transformational movement for the wellness of individuals, communities, and society at large!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It has been a challenging year for all of us to find balance in our lives.</p>
<p>As a public school educator, I have seen various challenges faced by colleagues, parents, students, friends, and family members. We are all seeking moments of restorative joy within the day-to-day of our challenges. During my conversations with others, many people have expressed concerns about the deterioration of mental health. This may be recognized through experiences of boredom, low self-confidence, anxiety, and varying levels of depression. This can be found in our homes, our schools, our work environments, and our public spaces. People can hide it more often than not, but does it have to be this way? Do possibilities exist for developing a stronger, more confident, creative self for our own joy and to benefit those around us?</p>
<p><strong>My Back Story with an Attention to Creative Play.</strong><br/>After a fairly straightforward and traditional art education throughout youth and high school, it was <a href=""https://www.jmu.edu/artandarthistory/faculty-and-staff/faculty/zurbrigg-susan.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Professor Susan Zurbrigg</a> who changed the way I see art and, ultimately, life forever.  I’d excelled in her undergraduate course at James Madison University, Drawing 101, using the visualization methods I’d used up until that point.  Seeing it in my mind, drawing it on paper or canvas.  There’s nothing wrong with this approach.  It can be effective in many contexts, but perhaps lacking in others.  The next semester, on the first day in Foundations Painting, Professor Zurbrigg stopped me:<br/><br/>“Emily, you’re in no way going to approach this class in the reserved, perfectionist manner you used last semester.”<br/><br/>I was stunned.  What did she mean?<br/><br/>“You’re going to leave all the baggage at the door.”<br/><br/>I didn’t understand.  It didn’t take long to start to learn, though.  Weeks later I stood before a giant canvas, Professor Zurbrigg encouraging me to make large sweeping marks.<br/><br/>“Feel the experience of painting, the process.”  </p>
<p>“You don’t need a plan.”  </p>
<p>“Open yourself up.”</p>
<p><br/>These became like a song of mindfulness, mantras to displace me from the need to try to replicate perfection.  It was awkward for me at first.  Emptying myself of the expectations and methodology I had always relied on took time.  Months into practicing this new approach, though, of truly ridding myself of limiting mindsets—”good or bad, beautiful or ugly”—I was transformed.<br/><br/>The creatures that appeared on the canvas astounded me--birds with teeth, a half-dog-half-peacock flying through the night,  a one-eyed desk lamp, and others I’d never seen before!  A menagerie released from my mind and set free on canvas. It was exhilarating.  I painted more and more and by the end of the semester had my first solo exhibition at the Artful Dodger in Harrisonburg, Virginia.</p>
<p>My capacity to see the parts of the whole had grown. I'd learned to see the world again for the first time, as a child, the greatest gift any professor could’ve given me. </p>
<p>Thank you, Professor Zurbrigg.  I hope to further share the understanding you taught me.</p>
<p><strong>Please check out the testimonials from friends and family who speak to the witnessing of these experiences.</strong> They can be found in my campaign video and additional videos will be added weekly with my campaign on my Studio Gnome website at <a href=""http://www.studiognome.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.studiognome.com</a>.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The campaign's risk is <i>nonexistent</i>.  All donations will receive their 'thank you' perk, regardless of the campaign's final donation amount, and I will hold creative play classes to meet interest. This said, I hope to dedicate and immerse myself full-time in further developing this pilot program as my play/work passion during summers off from teaching public school.  For this to happen, I will need to meet my campaign goal.</p>

<p>If you are not in a position to monetarily donate to the mission of Studio Gnome, please know that it is still a GREAT HELP to me when you share this campaign with your friends and family.

<br/><strong>The Impact</strong>
</h3><p>Since its advent, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a disaster for girls; pulling them out of education and pushing them into sexual exploitation. Given the unprecedented speed of this occurrence, it has quickly become evident that we have to be faster, bolder and more innovative in our response. We launched XOCO in 2020 as an unconventional edtech venture to change the game for girls.</p><p>We are on fire to connect the dots and build innovative partnerships, co-creating new solutions to <strong>bridge the digital divide and the equity gap in education</strong>. </p><p><strong>The impact of our Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign will be catalytic:</strong> It will enable us to pilot and refine our model with parallel pilot cohorts across Latin America, Africa and Asia. This will lead us to the milestone of proof-of-concept and subsequently allow us to scale our model exponentially. </p><h3>
<br/><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong>
</h3><p>Our greatest risk is <strong>fundraising</strong> in the startup phase. The fundraising risk is closely related to our biggest challenge: <strong>Balancing depth of impact with scale of impact. </strong></p><p><strong>In this pilot phase, we have a strong focus on depth of impact. </strong>This means we focus on the most vulnerable adolescent girls in the global South and we accompany them on their education journey with a very intensive and holistic long-term model, so we can be sure that they actually and sustainably escape gender-based violence and leapfrog to digital jobs of the future. </p><ul>
<li>Our Latin America pilot focuses on girls who are caught up in complicated situations of sexual exploitation. Our digital education &amp; empowerment program is their way out. Many of them have babies and are homeless. Given the complexity of the challenge, our holistic empowerment model is resource intensive: In Colombia, we provide a full-fledged shelter solution and empowerment support in addition to our digital education program to catch up with basic education and prepare them for the digital jobs of the future.<br/> </li>
<li>Our Global pilot takes a more prevention-oriented approach, focusing on adolescent girls at high risk of gender-based violence. Our digital education program empowers them to navigate these risks, cope with the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic and continue their education journey, completing high school while joining our global accelerator program.</li>
</ul><p><br/>Depth of impact is important for this first phase of our venture in order to co-create an innovative education model that delivers on the envisioned impact goals. <strong>Once we have a tested and proven solution, we will scale it through partnerships, placing greater emphasis on the scale of impact. </strong></p><p>XOCO recently became a fellow of<strong> Columbia e-Lab</strong> designed to bring together a selected <strong>cohort of the best 25 edtech &amp; reskilling startup founders</strong> from around the world. This peer learning community allows us to share knowledge and learnings, challenges and solutions, with other leading edtech entrepreneurs. This network will be a great resource and help us turn these challenges into opportunities. </p><h3>

The Impact
Since its advent, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a disaster for girls; pulling them out of education and pushing them into sexual exploitation. Given the unprecedented speed of this occurrence, it has quickly become evident that we have to be faster, bolder and more innovative in our response. We launched XOCO in 2020 as an unconventional edtech venture to change the game for girls.We are on fire to connect the dots and build innovative partnerships, co-creating new solutions to bridge the digital divide and the equity gap in education. The impact of our Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign will be catalytic: It will enable us to pilot and refine our model with parallel pilot cohorts across Latin America, Africa and Asia. This will lead us to the milestone of proof-of-concept and subsequently allow us to scale our model exponentially. 
Risks & Challenges
Our greatest risk is fundraising in the startup phase. The fundraising risk is closely related to our biggest challenge: Balancing depth of impact with scale of impact. In this pilot phase, we have a strong focus on depth of impact. This means we focus on the most vulnerable adolescent girls in the global South and we accompany them on their education journey with a very intensive and holistic long-term model, so we can be sure that they actually and sustainably escape gender-based violence and leapfrog to digital jobs of the future. 
Our Latin America pilot focuses on girls who are caught up in complicated situations of sexual exploitation. Our digital education & empowerment program is their way out. Many of them have babies and are homeless. Given the complexity of the challenge, our holistic empowerment model is resource intensive: In Colombia, we provide a full-fledged shelter solution and empowerment support in addition to our digital education program to catch up with basic education and prepare them for the digital jobs of the future. 
Our Global pilot takes a more prevention-oriented approach, focusing on adolescent girls at high risk of gender-based violence. Our digital education program empowers them to navigate these risks, cope with the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic and continue their education journey, completing high school while joining our global accelerator program.
Depth of impact is important for this first phase of our venture in order to co-create an innovative education model that delivers on the envisioned impact goals. Once we have a tested and proven solution, we will scale it through partnerships, placing greater emphasis on the scale of impact. XOCO recently became a fellow of Columbia e-Lab designed to bring together a selected cohort of the best 25 edtech & reskilling startup founders from around the world. This peer learning community allows us to share knowledge and learnings, challenges and solutions, with other leading edtech entrepreneurs. This network will be a great resource and help us turn these challenges into opportunities.

This cost includes transport of the tank to the school by the supplier.2.The water Outlet Units cost each 100,000/= (One hundred thousands)3.Total Cost of making basements slabs for each tank 500,000/-(Two hundred thousands)4.Cost of gutter and other plumbing accessories required for the systems = 200,000/= (Two hundred shillings)5.Total cost of labor on the system at 300,000/=This totals to Uganda Shillings 4,600,000/= (Four Millions Six hundred thousands) Equivalent to US Dollars 1200This is what is being requested for.OUT COME OF THE PROJECT:There will be no more shortages of water at the school once these tanks are secured.As a result the school will no longer incur the expenses it incurs in paying for purchase of water and thus save the money for other useful necessities of the running of the school.The school will be safe from sanitary related diseases.This will improve the efficiency running of the school, the comfort of the pupils and staff thus promotes discipline and academic performance of the students.It will reduce or remove possibilities of pupils’ strikes.MAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT.Once the tank has been installed the School administration with participation of the pupils and staff body, will maintain and make sure the project keeps running at the school.Contribute using the BERK IT Button on the campaign.Contact me: muhangamodernprimaryschool@gmail.comNEW: THIS CAMPAIGN IS NOW RUNNING IN IN DEMAND.WHICH MEANS YOU CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION.WE DID THIS SO WE CAN RAISE MORE FUNDS AND BUY MORE TANKS TO SETTLE THE WATER PROBLEM AT THE SCHOOL.THANK YOU:",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","RISC-V is a trending now, we have seen more and more RV32 chips last few years, but the RV64 chip which able to run standard Linux System is rare and expensive.
Now, we have an affordable choice for 64bit RISC-V SBC: Nezha.
 
Nezha is based on Allwinner's newest RISC-V chip, D1 @1.0GHz(T-Head XuanTie C906 core), with 1GByte DDR3 and 256MByte onboard Nand Flash. It has basic resources and environments that allow you to research RV64 features on itself, just like a desktop PC.It is likely your first universal RV64 Linux SBC~
 
Nezha is not designed for heavy computation applications but designed for the RV64 opensource community and IoT application.It is easily run without a heatsink, and the temperature is below 50℃, chip power consume < 0.1A@5VNezha has most of the peripherals you need in IoT applications:  MIPI LCD, HDMI, USB, ETH, SPI/UART/IIC/PWM/LEDC/IIS/GPIOs.You can build your projects easily and quickly.

 

Nezha has an open-source SDK thus that will allow us to port Debian Desktop System to it, and we can test many popular program environments on it: C/C++, JS, WASM, Rust, GoLang, Python, etc.
 

Nezha is the first Sub-100$ RV64 Linux SBC that can run almost all regular software development experiments, the Basic Kit(With cables and pre-burned Debian image micro SD card) starts from $99.
 
 

 
This campaign is authorized by Allwinner Online, aim to promote RV ecology .
We will send out the first 100 boards before the campaign end(20days). Both Telegram Group and Forum are open for communication.

The core tenets of the approach include working to ensure that every child has the right to an education, a childhood free from trauma and violence, and the hope of a peaceful tomorrow. Project Amal ou Salam has a successful track record of delivering this approach in week-long workshops in Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey with volunteers from around the world, in the school that it funds in Jordan and in its community and educational partnerships around the region.  </p><p><strong>Our Origins</strong></p><p>While visiting an IDP camp in Syria in 2013, Co-Founders Nousha Kabawat and Aziz Abu Sarah were struck by the bored children mirroring the anger, violence and sectarianism around them and began to imagine a grassroots effort to feed the children’s self-esteem and character. With a background in conflict resolution and peacebuilding in post-war societies, Nousha worked to turn her dream of a multicultural, interfaith community into a reality called Project Amal ou Salam.</p><p>Free from politics and sectarian dogma, Project Amal ou Salam operates across Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria – few NGOs for Syrian refugee children founded in the past few years are working across borders. </p><p>According to the UNHCR, to date there more than 5 million registered and unregistered Syrian refugees living in neighboring countries, of which more than half are under the age of 17. Since the revolution began in 2011, these children have been forced from their homes and country and have been unable to access basic needs or education. In 2019, children up to eight years old have known nothing but a life of war and conflict. </p><p><strong><i>Through our workshops, schools and community centers, Project Amal ou Salam has supported over 7,500 children in four different countries, aided by nearly 200 volunteers from around the world.</i></strong></p><p><strong>Project Amal ou Salam School – Ajloun, Jordan</strong></p><p>In October 2019, with the help of our amazing supporters, Project Amal ou Salam opened a new school center in Ajloun, Jordan to meet the needs of local Syrian children and their families living there. At this center, we focus on early childhood education, preparing the youngest members of the Syrian community with the tools they’ll need to succeed in the Jordanian schools. The school currently serves approximately 70 children, ages 5-8 years old, and is staffed by 2 full-time teachers, all from Syria. </p><p>Since the Covid-19 outbreak began, our team, students, and their families have been working hard to keep our kids safe and provide them with the best educational environment possible. In Jordan, 2.4 million students missed out on school last year, the majority did not have any option for online learning or support while schools were closed. Our school maintained online instruction and support (for both students and parents), using zoom, whatsapp, and carefully distributed supplies. The kids were able to learn their alphabets, numbers, healthy habits and tons more, because they had continued access to our amazing teachers and supporters. </p><p>Once restrictions were lifted, our students and teachers resumed in-person classes and started making up for all their lost time. We are happy to report we are continuing split day classes to maintain healthy safeguards and create new opportunities for our students. Through the generous donations of our supporters (you!!) we are able to offer year round services for the kids, including fall, spring and summer terms, ensuring that they are all as ready as can be when they graduate to the government schools in first-grade. </p><p><strong>Project Amal ou Salam Workshops – Jordan and Lebanon</strong></p><p>Project Amal ou Salam’s workshops provide open dialogue, giving the kids a safe space to tackle the issues that they face and develop their own ideas and visions for the future of Syria. With activities not present in the refugee camps, our workshops for Syrian refugee children arm them with the tools and confidence to rebuild Syria through art, health, photography, sports and music.</p><p><strong>Other Activities &amp; Past Work</strong></p><p>In addition to activities run by Project Amal ou Salam, we have provided material donations (e.g., coloring books, games, sports equipment) and monetary support to schools both within and outside of Syria (Turkey and Lebanon). Additionally, we have supported activities in Idlib, Syria; sent school and art supplies to a refugee camp in Ersal, Lebanon; hosted a football tournament for hundreds of Syrian kids as well as hosted Ramadan meals and Eid celebrations for hundreds of Syrian children and their families in Jordan; and hosted Eid celebrations in Suroui, Turkey for Kurdish refugees who had recently arrived from Kobani, Syria. </p><p>In 2015, Project Amal ou Salam volunteers in Aleppo, Syria provided an underground community center and pre-school for children during the siege. This center provided a safe and secure place away from the war for the children to learn and grow, enjoying movie days, arts and crafts, and activities to help them process their trauma. Our center remained open until our last volunteers were evacuated from the city. </p><p>In 2019, we closed our flagship school in Jordan, feeling that we had successfully met the needs of the Syrian community there. Our school served by filling a gap in the education system: Syrian children were not allowed to enroll in Jordanian schools until they were able to pass tests at their appropriate grade level. This gap left many school aged children at a significant disadvantage to their peers, manifesting in poor grades, difficulty coping with the rigors of a school setting, depression, anxiety, and acting out. Before the war, nearly all Syrian children were enrolled in school. For many years, most Syrian children living as refugees in Jordan had been out of school for a long time and were in need significant catch-up time and individualized attention to make up for the hundreds of hours of class time they have missed out on. The Amal ou Salam school prepared students to engage in their new school settings, catch up on the lessons they missed out on and ensures that they can perform as well as their Jordanian peers in their new classrooms. More than 200 students were successfully matriculated into the local Jordanian system and given additional support to help them thrive. After they entered the Jordanian schools, we continued to provide after-school support and tutoring, a safe place to grow, and resources for their families. </p><p><strong>Spreading the Word</strong></p><p>We are always honored when Project Amal ou Salam is featured in the media because it is a great opportunity for more people to learn about the work that we do. Here are some of our favorite features:</p><p>BBC, Syria’s Next Generation, <a href=""http://goo.gl/SvIGA0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://goo.gl/SvIGA0</a></p><p>Elle Magazine, Young, Syrian, Female: This Is How you Fight ISIS's Values <a href=""http://goo.gl/SFeJth"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://goo.gl/SFeJth</a></p><p>Huffington Post, 6 Organizations Helping Syrian Refugees That You Might Not Have Heard Of, <a href=""http://goo.gl/Cn1Mwe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://goo.gl/Cn1Mwe</a></p><p>National Geographic, Life Through the Lens of Syria’s Uprooted Teens, <a href=""http://goo.gl/lWktpO"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://goo.gl/lWktpO</a></p><p>When speaking on a panel at the UN's Global Forum on Youth, Peace and Security, Nousha summarized the issue well when she said: ""Syria has become a complex issue but please don't think it is only about violence and killing. Think about the children who need love, attention and caring from everyone around the world so that they become the future generation, not a lost generation.""</p><p><strong>Impact – Why Your Support is Critical</strong></p><p>Providing a safe space for the psycho-social development of Syria’s children is both crucial for the rebuilding and reconciliation processes and for the future of Syrian society, and is more sustainable than direct aid. When PTSD and depression are not treated in children, it results in flashbacks, emotional instability, violent and aggressive behavior, nightmares, isolation and poor academic achievement. Helping the next generation cope with the trauma and tragedy of war will aid them in becoming strong, capable, and productive members of society ready to rebuild their country!</p><p>Your donation will go directly towards expanding, building and developing the implementation of Project Amal ou Salam.

Project Amal ou Salam has a successful track record of delivering this approach in week-long workshops in Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey with volunteers from around the world, in the school that it funds in Jordan and in its community and educational partnerships around the region.  Our OriginsWhile visiting an IDP camp in Syria in 2013, Co-Founders Nousha Kabawat and Aziz Abu Sarah were struck by the bored children mirroring the anger, violence and sectarianism around them and began to imagine a grassroots effort to feed the children’s self-esteem and character. With a background in conflict resolution and peacebuilding in post-war societies, Nousha worked to turn her dream of a multicultural, interfaith community into a reality called Project Amal ou Salam.Free from politics and sectarian dogma, Project Amal ou Salam operates across Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria – few NGOs for Syrian refugee children founded in the past few years are working across borders. According to the UNHCR, to date there more than 5 million registered and unregistered Syrian refugees living in neighboring countries, of which more than half are under the age of 17. Since the revolution began in 2011, these children have been forced from their homes and country and have been unable to access basic needs or education. In 2019, children up to eight years old have known nothing but a life of war and conflict. Through our workshops, schools and community centers, Project Amal ou Salam has supported over 7,500 children in four different countries, aided by nearly 200 volunteers from around the world.Project Amal ou Salam School – Ajloun, JordanIn October 2019, with the help of our amazing supporters, Project Amal ou Salam opened a new school center in Ajloun, Jordan to meet the needs of local Syrian children and their families living there. At this center, we focus on early childhood education, preparing the youngest members of the Syrian community with the tools they’ll need to succeed in the Jordanian schools. The school currently serves approximately 70 children, ages 5-8 years old, and is staffed by 2 full-time teachers, all from Syria. Since the Covid-19 outbreak began, our team, students, and their families have been working hard to keep our kids safe and provide them with the best educational environment possible. In Jordan, 2.4 million students missed out on school last year, the majority did not have any option for online learning or support while schools were closed. Our school maintained online instruction and support (for both students and parents), using zoom, whatsapp, and carefully distributed supplies. The kids were able to learn their alphabets, numbers, healthy habits and tons more, because they had continued access to our amazing teachers and supporters. Once restrictions were lifted, our students and teachers resumed in-person classes and started making up for all their lost time. We are happy to report we are continuing split day classes to maintain healthy safeguards and create new opportunities for our students. Through the generous donations of our supporters (you!!) we are able to offer year round services for the kids, including fall, spring and summer terms, ensuring that they are all as ready as can be when they graduate to the government schools in first-grade. Project Amal ou Salam Workshops – Jordan and LebanonProject Amal ou Salam’s workshops provide open dialogue, giving the kids a safe space to tackle the issues that they face and develop their own ideas and visions for the future of Syria. With activities not present in the refugee camps, our workshops for Syrian refugee children arm them with the tools and confidence to rebuild Syria through art, health, photography, sports and music.Other Activities & Past WorkIn addition to activities run by Project Amal ou Salam, we have provided material donations (e.g., coloring books, games, sports equipment) and monetary support to schools both within and outside of Syria (Turkey and Lebanon). Additionally, we have supported activities in Idlib, Syria; sent school and art supplies to a refugee camp in Ersal, Lebanon; hosted a football tournament for hundreds of Syrian kids as well as hosted Ramadan meals and Eid celebrations for hundreds of Syrian children and their families in Jordan; and hosted Eid celebrations in Suroui, Turkey for Kurdish refugees who had recently arrived from Kobani, Syria. In 2015, Project Amal ou Salam volunteers in Aleppo, Syria provided an underground community center and pre-school for children during the siege. This center provided a safe and secure place away from the war for the children to learn and grow, enjoying movie days, arts and crafts, and activities to help them process their trauma. Our center remained open until our last volunteers were evacuated from the city. In 2019, we closed our flagship school in Jordan, feeling that we had successfully met the needs of the Syrian community there. Our school served by filling a gap in the education system: Syrian children were not allowed to enroll in Jordanian schools until they were able to pass tests at their appropriate grade level. This gap left many school aged children at a significant disadvantage to their peers, manifesting in poor grades, difficulty coping with the rigors of a school setting, depression, anxiety, and acting out. Before the war, nearly all Syrian children were enrolled in school. For many years, most Syrian children living as refugees in Jordan had been out of school for a long time and were in need significant catch-up time and individualized attention to make up for the hundreds of hours of class time they have missed out on. The Amal ou Salam school prepared students to engage in their new school settings, catch up on the lessons they missed out on and ensures that they can perform as well as their Jordanian peers in their new classrooms. More than 200 students were successfully matriculated into the local Jordanian system and given additional support to help them thrive. After they entered the Jordanian schools, we continued to provide after-school support and tutoring, a safe place to grow, and resources for their families. Spreading the WordWe are always honored when Project Amal ou Salam is featured in the media because it is a great opportunity for more people to learn about the work that we do. Here are some of our favorite features:BBC, Syria’s Next Generation, http://goo.gl/SvIGA0Elle Magazine, Young, Syrian, Female: This Is How you Fight ISIS's Values http://goo.gl/SFeJthHuffington Post, 6 Organizations Helping Syrian Refugees That You Might Not Have Heard Of, http://goo.gl/Cn1MweNational Geographic, Life Through the Lens of Syria’s Uprooted Teens, http://goo.gl/lWktpOWhen speaking on a panel at the UN's Global Forum on Youth, Peace and Security, Nousha summarized the issue well when she said: ""Syria has become a complex issue but please don't think it is only about violence and killing. Think about the children who need love, attention and caring from everyone around the world so that they become the future generation, not a lost generation.""Impact – Why Your Support is CriticalProviding a safe space for the psycho-social development of Syria’s children is both crucial for the rebuilding and reconciliation processes and for the future of Syrian society, and is more sustainable than direct aid. When PTSD and depression are not treated in children, it results in flashbacks, emotional instability, violent and aggressive behavior, nightmares, isolation and poor academic achievement. Helping the next generation cope with the trauma and tragedy of war will aid them in becoming strong, capable, and productive members of society ready to rebuild their country!Your donation will go directly towards expanding, building and developing the implementation of Project Amal ou Salam.

<p><span><strong>What We Do:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The Bahath Centre, located in a Moshi, Kilimanjaro, is home to 21 Tanzanian street children who have been orphaned by either neglect, abuse, or poverty.  Orphaned children and children whose families cannot properly provide for them come to the Centre for daily support, shelter, food, education, healthcare, guidance, and love.  </span></p>
<p><span>We don't see the Bahath Centre as an orphanage.  Instead, we see our Centre as one big family.  Our motto: <strong>The Home of Love and a Better Future for the Children.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The Bahath Centre was founded in June 2011 by two local Tanzanian men, Joseph Lyimo and Emmanuel Tesha.  Both Joseph and Emmanuel experienced difficult hardships as young children growing up in impoverished Tanzanian families so they decided they wanted to help other children in their community who deal with  similar struggles.      </span></p>
<p><span>Education is a major priority of the Bahath Centre.  The Centre believes that education is the most important tool when escaping poverty.  Thus, the Centre aims to ensure that each child has an equal opportunity to a strong and complete education.</span></p>
<p><span>With this campaign, we are striving to raise enough money to send each child to school for the 2013/2014 school year.  Without a proper education, these children will not have an open door to a strong and prosperous future.  With our funding goal of $3,000, we will be able to pay for a full year of schooling for all of the Bahath Centre children.  This includes school fees, uniforms, exercise books, pencils, and other necessary school supplies.  </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>What We Need:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>All 21 of our children attend local primary school 5 days a week, 9 months out of the year.  Our children LOVE to learn and love to go to school!  The school provides classes in Kiswahili, English, Mathematics, Science, History, Arts, and Health.  The children run home to the Centre everyday, excited to share what they have learned with each other.  </span></p>
<p><span>We need a total of $3,000 to pay for the school fees, uniforms, and school supplies for all 21 children for the next school year.  Here is a breakdown of our costs:</span></p>
<ul><ul>
<li><span>$50 pays for 1 child to go to primary school for 1 year</span></li>
<li><span>$42 pays for 1 school uniform</span></li>
<li><span>$38 pays for 1 year of school supplies for 1 child</span></li>

The group works<br/> with orphans, street youth, and most vulnerable families (often child headed<br/> households) to try to make a difference.

The goal is to help the youth of Tanzania develop language skills and life skills that will provide them with a better future. </span></div>

<p>Noel has just started an apprenticeship for an automotive repairman. What I anticipate is that he needs tools (spanners/wrenches, etc.) and he also needs to get a driver's license so he will likely need 150 shillings for the licence and 100 shillings for the tools. </p>
<p>Hamedi is 11 years old and really should be in a boarding school.  This would cost about $45 per month plus a few extra dollars for books, etc. For the youth on the street the biggest needs are shoes and food. </p>
<p>We are looking at the opportunity for a group home or drop in setting, but buildings are very expensive here and this continues to be a wish. We also have a few street boys who are learning how to be barbers - we have some of the supplies but this is another area for support to buy clippers and hair driers.</p>
<p>We always have need for bicycles - these are a way for the youth to make money (they can be couriers/delivery people). Bicycles here are expensive but they use them until there is literally nothing left!</p>
<p>We could use chicken coups at any of the orphanages - these are about 200$ plus about 50$ for the chickens</p>
<p>We could use beds for the boys.  We have mattresses, but need the beds<br/> which are about 150$ each. </p>
<p>*Our perks are amazing. Donated items from friends include an original 1 of 2 lithiograph signed from Batmans creator Bob Kane, 2 bottles of Patron donated by Patron your choice of bottle, 15 cosmetic and skincare gift bags from Armani at Holt Renfrew (Sherway Gardens) appreciation cards and a facebook invite to follow the learning experience.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p></div>","I had no idea this is where my life would take me. I was 26, just finished a masters degree. On a whim, I flew into Uganda. Within 24hrs of arriving in Gulu Town, I was volunteering at a local Reception Centre for children and women abducted by the rebel group, the Lord’s Resistance Army – aka the LRA.   


At the Centre, I worked with some Unaccompanied Minors – kids born into the captivity of the LRA who had been rescued without parents. Although they're usually united with loving extended families, the extreme poverty across the region force many of these kids into orphanages.  My local colleagues agreed: 
 

It didn't make sense – these kids were being raised in orphanages, when only a small amount of support would let them to grow up in a loving family instead 

...Empowering Kids in Uganda (EKU) was born. 
EKU now supports 19 kids who were born into LRA captivity to stay with their loving families. We keep costs to a minimum and have only one paid staff – a local Ugandan social worker I’ve known for 3 years. Our voluntary board is made up of Canadians and local Ugandans. Everyone is so committed!My heart remains in Uganda, but I returned to Canada to fundraise and build EKU. We are in the middle of getting registered as a charity in Canada so we can issue tax receipts for donations. 
But, we need money NOW to get the kids through Term 2 of school this year. 
We need $2500 to ensure that all our kids stay in school.
These children have had a tough life and have been through more than we can imagine. But every day they teach us about the power of resilience, smiles, and laughter.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Humming Hive Forest Preschool is a Waldorf-inspired, outdoor preschool on the edge of over 5000 acres of forest within the city limits of Portland, Oregon.  The children, ages 3 to 5 years old, spend their entire day outside, rain or shine, even through the cold, rainy season.  The children play, sing, tell stories, make art and crafts, garden, visit the chickens and ducks that live on the land; they experience the rhythm of the seasons intimately, and form meaningful relationships with each other and the plants and animals of the forest. We also offer summer camp programs to include as many children from the area as possible. If you would like to learn more about our school, please visit our website, <a href=""http://www.humminghive.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.humminghive.org</a>.</p>
<p>   Our home base for the school day is our outdoor kitchen, the Fern House.  We began in our first year with a plastic tarp, hanging between trees, over a table. While this has worked for a couple of years, we wish to offer the children a stronger, more beautiful and inspiring roof under which to eat meals, paint and make crafts.  We are also building an earthen oven, made of clay, sand and straw, so that we can bake bread with the children each week for snack, and other baked treats for special occasions.</p>
<h3>   This is where you come in: We are a preschool with a good vision and a small budget, so we need your donations to make this possible!</h3>
<p>   Your donations will go toward:</p>
<p>-skilled builders to facilitate the building of the cob oven and the roof</p>
<p>-materials for the roof, including reclaimed wood, steel, and weatherproof canvas fabric</p>
<p>-industrial sewing of canvas fabric</p>
<h3>Thank you!</h3>
<p>    To express our gratitude for your donations, we have some wonderful gifts to share with you. Every donor, no matter how small or large the donation, will receive a card printed with one of the children's drawings.  For larger financial donations, the parents and teachers have come up with a variety of exciting gifts to show their gratitude, including hand-knitted children's mittens, a jar of herbal healing salve, hand-dyed silk cloths, a week of summer camp at our school, and more.</p>
<p>   If we do not reach our goal, we will pursue other fundraising efforts, as we are committed to building this oven and roof for the children.  <br/>   If we exceed our financial goal, the remaining monies will help purchase materials and supplies for the children, support future projects, and go into a tuition assistance fund for low-income families. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>    Our love and commitment to children, society, and the Earth motivates us to offer the children an experience of connection with nature, which is becoming more and more rare in these times when it is most needed.  This connection provides the children with a sense of confidence as they climb hills and trees, a healthy lifestyle as they spend most of their days in a natural environment, breathing fresh air and eating whole grains and vegetables, and wonder, creativity, and powerful observational skills which will lead to strong academic skills in later years.  This connection provides society and the Earth with strong and balanced individuals who have cultivated a caring relationship with the natural world.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is able to contribute with money. You can still help by spreading the word about this fundraising campaign, our school, and nature immersion schools as a growing educational movement.  Use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word instantly, and like us on Facebook!</p>

<p> Operation Ride is a non-profit organization with the unique mission of getting wounded wartime veterans back on motorcycles.  Our task is to identify amputee, PTSD and Traumatic Brain  injured hero’s  that have had past motorcycle experience and to help them determine the actions needed to get back on two wheels.   It could be motorcycle modifications by moving gear shifters or brakes or just coaching and motivating them in gaining the confidence to overcome the challenges they are confronted with.</p>
<p> We believe there is no better way to see this beautiful country of ours then on two wheels in the back roads and through untouched landscapes, that’s why the first Major goal is to help 5-10 wounded veterans regain the confidence and ability to traverse the nation on adventure style motorcycles using the trans American trail: a trail that crosses the United States from Eastern Tennessee to the Oregon Coast This will take place on nothing but dirt roads, fire breaks, and walking paths, a distance of 2000 miles.  A true measure of endurance. </p>
<p> We will then take any and all knowledge learned about prosthetic challenges then document needed changes to give back to other organizations, (learning institutions and the veterans administration) so that they can build better products for our troops and for other disabled people so that they too can get back on motorcycles.</p>
<p> Once we have establish  the nation wide ride, our plan is to hold regional quarterly training events with multi day rides for disabled veterans.</p>
<p> We are proposing a 50,000 dollar goal over a 50 day period.  Money raised will be used to help in the promotion and start up of operation ride</p>
<p> This money will be used for  three separate purposes:</p>
<p>  To help facilitate our outreach campaign that will generate awareness and interest in our organization.  This will include attending veteran, motorcycle and disability events.</p>
<p> To assist in the purchase of equipment to include motorcycles, modifications, helmets…. and to help maintain the equipment</p>
<p> To hire  certified instructors to teach best riding practices and to </p>
<p>pay for the travel costs to bring wounded veterans to our tampa florida based location, from locations nationwide for modifications and training.</p>
<p> We are counting on donations for all operational costs.  All employees,  including myself, work purely on a volunteer basis, so all money raised will go towards this cause.</p>

Project Summary
Daniel Stein and Ashley Portman are community organizers located in the Barre-Montpelier area of Vermont. Throughout the last decade Daniel and Ashley have worked with at-risk youth in a variety of awesome and inspiring ways. Most recently they are planning a summer empowerment program for the youth of Barre City, Vermont. Barre recently lost a summer and after-school program called CityScape, which helped youth “increase academic achievement, build new skills and interests, increase health and fitness, build connections with the community, and make healthy choices.”
In light of losing CityScape, Ashley and Daniel have developed a program which focuses on personal transformation and social change through direct action, exploration of personal values, earth-centered consciousness and holistic health education.
This program will engage youth in their communities, developing and strengthening vital skills and developmental assets which will help empower and enable youth to become strong leaders in our changing world -- leaders that are connected to themselves, each other and the Earth which sustains them. With your support, youth will have the opportunity to learn about issues which affect their community and create action plans to respond.
                
The project will be held at Aldrich Public Library in the heart of downtown. Participants will grow a plot at their local community garden, learn how to cook healthy local foods, explore sense of self and their relations with families, communities and the Earth. But most importantly, with your help and support, youth will have the opportunity to express their Voice and Know that they are an important asset in their community.
                                 
                                    Check out the awesome space we get to hang out in this summer.
 
What We Need & What You Get
This program requires two full-time positions for the summer, materials and supplies and a small general cash fund for expenses incurred throughout the project.
The exciting thing about this program is that Youth will be driving it. Our young friends will brainstorm a community issue and cooperatively create solutions that work for everybody. We believe that youth are inherently creative and innovative, and by nourishing these qualities and exhorting their personal strengths, youth will play a pivotal role in creating positive and sustainable changes in their world. 
Your funds will help pay the full-time Organizers leading this initiative. It will provide each youth with a Youth Rising Toolkit, complete with lessons, activities, and art supplies. Youth will receive nourishing snacks every day and participate in cooking a meal once a week. They will have the opportunity to play at the recreation center, go swimming and explore and learn during a field trip. Funds will also support a community garden plot that will feed and nourish their friends and neighbors.
 
                                               
The Impact
In a world of uncertainty and change, where we are witnessing the loss of many important programs for youth, it is imperative that we guide and assist them in designing and building their own programs that directly reflect what they need and hold important for their personal growth and well-being. This summer program is the first step in a long process of offering the youth of Barre with an opportunity to create their own youth-led initiative. Essentially, the “older youth (Daniel and Ashley)” are guiding mentors who provide counsel, structure, and safety, as well as serving as a link to community resources.

They created campaigns, researched, interviewed community members, wrote poetry and made art, sang, danced, and most importantly they expressed their Voice! The experience was a huge success.
This summer, in Barre, Youth Rising Project will nurture a powerful seed that will sprout into a youth-led afterschool program. Youth Rising Project will continue to grow to eventually emerge as a fully youth-led organization. Supporting this project will enable youth to attend this dynamic summer program for free and strengthen their connection to their community. This is why your funds are critical to success!!

my final year of study, in a local university called Jomo Kenyatta University
of Agriculture and Technology with a major in rain water harvesting.I am also a

Introduction</b></p>
<p>Kibwezi is a town in Makueni County in Kenya,
one of the semi-arid regions located in Eastern Kenya. It is inhibited mainly
by the Kamba community. Kibwezi has been experiencing the impact of climate
change such as recurring seasonal drought and environmental degradation leading
to inadequate water supply for domestic and livestock use.</p>
<p>The community especially the women and
girls are forced to walk for long distances in search of water. The Kamba rely
on subsistence crop farming which they do during the two main rainy seasons and
sell of honey during the dry season.</p>
<p>The high poverty levels have led to
increased school drop outs and forced early marriages in effort to secure the
bride price as a means of acquiring wealth.</p>
<p>The primary schools in this area have
no access to running water, poor sanitation and children attending the schools
come from very poor backgrounds. The schools can benefit greatly from rainwater
harvesting and management systems.</p>
<p>The funds will help achieve the
following objective in this area:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span></span>Improve
water access and management in 3 schools by installing 50,000liter masonry
tanks and gutter system. This will ensure that the children have clean and safe
water for drinking, cooking school meals and hand washing.</li>
<li>Support
nutrition for children through construction of 3 farm ponds in the 3 schools
including installation of drip irrigation systems (230 liters mini tank kits)
to supply water for the school vegetable gardens and tree seedling
establishment. This act as technology demonstrations aimed at creating
awareness and enhancing adoption to improve the livelihoods of the people
through promotion of small scale farming activities.</li>
<li>Enhancing
community capacity building initiatives through training and awareness creation
on various project components to the children, school staff and women groups in
the area. It will also include vegetable produce production under drip
irrigation, tree nursery establishment and to enhance environmental
conservation.</li>
<li>The
schools will also acquire new ventilated pit latrines.</li>
<li>This
projects will be managed by 3 women groups, one group per school. They will be
responsible for growing the vegetables and selling them in order to generate
income .This they will use to pay back the investment cost after the project
has been implemented for sustainability purposes.</li>
</ul><p>I believe that agriculture can solve
the problem of unemployment and food insecurity in Kenya.</p>
<p>70%
of Kenyan land is classified as arid and semiarid areas.60% of Kenyan land
remains uncultivated. It is projected by the World Bank that the population of
sub Saharan Africa will increase by 1.7 billion by 2050.There will be 1.1
billion young people of working age by 2050 in sub Saharan Africa. Something
must be done today for a better future.</p>
<p>I
also participated in an international event called Geeklist hack4good<span>  0.6 in Nairobi Kenya. The event was a
challenge that united programmers from different parts of the world to make
applications that hacked against catastrophic events caused by climate change.
During the hackathon my team participated and created an android mobile
application called Zingu that became the best under the category of hacking
against extreme climate events. Zingu would help calculate the amount of water
that can be harvest from a roofs area. It was difficult to convince people to
use the android application because many people did not have android devices.
For this reason I decided to go to the ground and practically help out create
rain water harvesting systems and promote sustainable agriculture.</span></p>

on subsistence crop farming which they do during the two main rainy seasons and
sell of honey during the dry season.
The high poverty levels have led to
increased school drop outs and forced early marriages in effort to secure the
bride price as a means of acquiring wealth.
The primary schools in this area have
no access to running water, poor sanitation and children attending the schools
come from very poor backgrounds. The schools can benefit greatly from rainwater
harvesting and management systems.
The funds will help achieve the
following objective in this area:


Improve
water access and management in 3 schools by installing 50,000liter masonry
tanks and gutter system. This will ensure that the children have clean and safe
water for drinking, cooking school meals and hand washing.
Support
nutrition for children through construction of 3 farm ponds in the 3 schools
including installation of drip irrigation systems (230 liters mini tank kits)
to supply water for the school vegetable gardens and tree seedling
establishment. This act as technology demonstrations aimed at creating
awareness and enhancing adoption to improve the livelihoods of the people
through promotion of small scale farming activities.
Enhancing
community capacity building initiatives through training and awareness creation
on various project components to the children, school staff and women groups in
the area. It will also include vegetable produce production under drip
irrigation, tree nursery establishment and to enhance environmental
conservation.
The
schools will also acquire new ventilated pit latrines.
This
projects will be managed by 3 women groups, one group per school. They will be
responsible for growing the vegetables and selling them in order to generate
income .This they will use to pay back the investment cost after the project
has been implemented for sustainability purposes.
I believe that agriculture can solve
the problem of unemployment and food insecurity in Kenya.
70%
of Kenyan land is classified as arid and semiarid areas.60% of Kenyan land
remains uncultivated. It is projected by the World Bank that the population of
sub Saharan Africa will increase by 1.7 billion by 2050.There will be 1.1
billion young people of working age by 2050 in sub Saharan Africa. Something
must be done today for a better future.
I
also participated in an international event called Geeklist hack4good  0.6 in Nairobi Kenya. The event was a
challenge that united programmers from different parts of the world to make
applications that hacked against catastrophic events caused by climate change.
During the hackathon my team participated and created an android mobile
application called Zingu that became the best under the category of hacking
against extreme climate events. Zingu would help calculate the amount of water
that can be harvest from a roofs area. It was difficult to convince people to
use the android application because many people did not have android devices.
For this reason I decided to go to the ground and practically help out create
rain water harvesting systems and promote sustainable agriculture.

For every:
10$ = 2 gutters
10$= 1 bag of cement to make masonry tanks.
5$ = 1 tree seedling
10$ = 1 packet of vegetable seeds
10$= 1 liter of car fuel

Radiant Kids School.  This school is run by Aparna Singh in Gurgaon to
educate the children of the poorest of the poor.  She does this amazing
job relying on her own funds and donations.  This week she lost her lease
on the property she was renting to run the school.  As she is looking for
a new property to rent, she found that the rents are out of her reach.
 There are currently 115 children in the school ranging in age from 3 to
18.  They are equally divided between girls and boys in a 50-50 ratio.
 A majority of these kids belong to the lower castes - they are children
of rag pickers, day laborers, maids, auto-rockshaw drivers etc.  Without a
project such as Radiant Kids, these children would be walking the streets or
begging or getting into other trouble.  Aparnaa runs the school via the
non-profit EcoLibFoundation.  </span><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #262626; letter-spacing: 1.0pt;""></span></p><p></p><p></p>

mobilized and collected INR 28000 for her ($450) within one day!  However,
that is not enough to save the school by renting another property.

 I have a passion for teaching children, giving back to my community, and investing in the leaders of tomorrow!  Won't you join me??To donate you can choose one of our INCREDIBLE perks on the right or you can donate ANY amount by clicking the CONTRIBUTE NOW button to the right or at the bottom of the page!!EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!  Remember this is for the children of our community!!!Be sure to click on the update tab above for more information!!Andrea's Angel Academy is an established pre-school and family daycare.  We have been at capacity since the beginning, and we now have a waiting list of Angels that we simply don't currently have room for. In terms of my own experience I have worked with children for 20 years through all different avenues such as baby-sitting, working for other daycare centers, working with youth in the criminal justice system, substitute teaching, being a foster parent, being mother to 3 beautiful children, and of course owning my own pre-school/daycare.I have prior management experience, and my formal education has been focused on education, sociology, and management.I started this campaign in hopes that people would recognize and appreciate my vision.  It is my hope that even if you don't know me or any of our Angels, that you will want to invest in a campaign that will make a difference in the lives of several generations to come.  Andrea's Angel Academy has the potential to be something GREAT, not only for our current Angels, but for our community as a whole.In addition to being an early childhood center which focuses on excellence for all of our Angels, we also hope to rise to be a strong local business which will give back to our community every day that we are open.It is my dream to see Andrea's Angel Academy making a difference in the lives of our children and their families.  It is also my dream to begin and end this venture debt-free.  I am very good at finding a bargain, and Andrea's Angel Academy will utilize every dollar to it's most extreme potential.  We are NOT trying to build a shiny new school that doesn't put the children as our first priority.  Regardless of our growth the children will always remain our focus.Andrea's Angel Academy believes strongly in family, compassion, education, and loyalty.  We are seeking to expand a company that started from the ground up, with one goal in mind, to care for any child who walks through our doors to the best of our ability.By making a generous donation towards our campaign you can make a difference in the lives of so many of our children.What We Need & What You GetAndrea's Angel Academy is seeking to reach a goal of $20,000 in the next 30 days!!  I know that we can reach this goal with your help!!This money will go towards securing our building.  As you may know it is not cheap to lease or buy a commercial space, and this is our biggest risk.  In order to avoid failure we would REALLY like to have this risk covered at the beginning so that we can focus more attention on the Angels.  $14,000 of our goal will go towards our building fund including the monthly payment and insurance along with materials that we will need like kitchen appliances, paint, ceiling tiles, and a small amount of vinyl flooring.The remaining $6,000 will go towards furniture for our classrooms, educational materials, and outdoor play equipment.For donating to our fundraiser you can receive some AWESOME perks!!  We are SUPER excited for growth, and we are SUPER excited that you are are willing to help us out!!Some of the perks we are offering include t-shirts, shout outs on our blog, free enrollment fees, jewelry, Mary Kay products and a makeover party, tickets to our AWESOME VIP Grand Opening Pizza Party, and tickets to Starlight Theater!!

Other Ways You Can Help There are over 800 school districts in New Jersey.  It is likely I will have too many schools to work with.  If you love to fish,  and enjoy working with children, like me, or just want to spend some quality time outdoors with your local community.  We will be needing volunteers to help fish with the students.  Just contact me hofnodnj@hotmail.com and I will schedule a 1 day training seminar, so you can be a certified instructor.  Or you can speak to your local school board and tell them about the project.  Better yet, tell the students about Hooked on Fishing Not On Drugs, and they will really get the BUZZ going.
Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!  And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

It is estimated that at least 1 in 1,000 Australians are transgender and recent research shows that 2-4% of young people are gender diverse. At least 50% of

Transgender people and people of gender minorities may be the only person in their school or family who identify differently, which can cause feelings of isolation and a lack of opportunities. 

Younger people may not have the money or the personal support to get a gender-affirming haircut for themselves. 
I am incredibly excited to partner with Razor Dolls (Chapel Street, Windsor, VIC) to hold a day of free haircuts for transgender and gender diverse youth. Their talented staff are very generously holding an extra day of business in December 2015 for this event.

   What We Need 

$350 will cover the basic costs of this event. 24 people will get a brand new hairdo - one that best reflects their desired presentation in align with their gender identity. All staff and clients will be supplied with a name & pronoun sticker to avoid being misgendered or mis-pronouned.

This event is about more than just haircuts. It will provide an opportunity for transgender and gender diverse youth to spend an afternoon together, sharing experiences and finding a sense of community within their peer group. 
A $750 total raised will help provide food and drinks for clients to enjoy with each other, and hair goodies to use on the day - glitter, coloured hair chalk, hair clips and ties! 
A $1,000+ total will cover all of the above, plus the costs of cosmetics so clients can choose to get their nails painted, a temporary tattoo, or a mini eye makeover.

Certified by the <a href=""http://www.wfto.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">World Fair Trade Organization </a>(WFTO), we work to preserve the ancient Mayan art of backstrap weaving as a culturally and economically viable enterprise for the women who weave. We merge traditional weaving techniques with contemporary design to create beautiful textile products with a conscience. Cojolya is committed to the health and well-being of our community. Our weavers earn a fair living wage and recieve professional development training, design services, materials, and access to an international marketplace of buyers. In addition, Cojolya runs the <a href=""http://www.cojolya.org/stoves.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cojolya Social ONIL Sustainiable Stove Project</a>, which seeks to install safe cookstoves in the homes of our community members to avoid the health and environmental problems associated with cooking over an open fire. Through gaining access to a steady, separate income source, our weavers become breadwinners for their families and gain increased power and independence to fight the marginalization that many Mayan women face.

<h2>Holiday Visit to the Ixchel Museum</h2>
<p>The holidays are a time of celebration and family in Santiago Atitlan. To this end, each year the Cojolya Association brings together its family of artisans  to celebrate the past year. As an organization, we strive to make sure that our talented weavers are recognized for their expertise on the loom, and that they recieve the respect they deserve as artisans. A trip to the <a href=""http://www.museoixchel.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ixchel Museum of Indigenous Clothing and Textiles</a> in Guatemala City will allow our weavers to see their weaving tradition showcased in one of the most famous museums in Guatemala. In addition, since many of our professional development sessions in the past several years have focused on teaching our weavers techniques native to other regions of Guatemala, a trip to the Ixchel Museum will allow our artisans to be educated and inspired by Guatemala's many non-Tz'utujil textile arts. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For rural Mayan women, access to Guatemala City's museums is barred. For most of Cojolya's weavers, few of whom speak Spanish,
the opportunity to visit the capital city comes very infrequently, if ever. To
get to and from the capital one has travel eight hours, which leaves very
little time in the city to complete necessary errands. The Museo Ixchel lies
outside of city bus lines, requiring a taxi to get there. Most importantly,
most Mayan weavers do not even know about the museum -- its focus is on
international tourism and is patronized by Guatemala's upper class. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

themselves how their own skills have been raised upon a pedestal for all the
world to appreciate, is a huge boost to their self-esteem.  We hope that
this type of experience will encourage them to cherish their tradition and work
to preserve it, as is the mission of the Cojolya Associaton of Maya Women

<div>Hello!  My name is Elizabeth and I am a super awesome, intelligent, and amazing (at least that's what people tell me, wink wink) Mercy College of Ohio Nursing Student.  I have been given the distinctive opportunity to travel to Antigua, Guatemala through school (during Spring Break) to be of service to children with severe physical and/or mental disabilities living in the Santo Hermano Pedro Long-Term Care Facility.  I am grateful to have been chosen and think the children of Santo Hermano Pedro have so much to teach me. I hope to gain a great deal of insight while in Guatemala, as well as enhance my nursing skills, enabling me to blossom into the caring, compassionate, and competent Nurse I strive towards everyday!</div>

<li>for a contribution of $100 or more, you will receive a totally righteous (and slightly larger) souvenir also hand-selected by me </li>
<li>best part is EVERYONE who contributes will receive my eternal gratitude!</li>

<p><b>So,
Why?</b></p>
</div><div> </div><p></p><div>
</div><p>You’re probably asking yourself, why is this important to
me and to anyone else? Easy! History is ALWAYS important and there is so much more to history than
dates, names, and battles. There is the culture and the lifestyle these men and
women in our past experienced daily that we often don’t think or learn about in school,
or out of it.  That is
where I come in, and that is where this internship can help! There is so much
to be learned from this opportunity that I can then pass on to all of you! I
will be able to gain a much better understanding of the fashions of the past
and the trade of a Milliner-Mantua Maker that can’t be learned in books alone;
but through living it daily and DOING it. It is what some of us like to refer
to as “experimental archaeology”, and is just as important and valuable to
education as a textbook can be.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><div>
</div><p>As an educator, the importance of relaying correct and
well-researched history and knowledge is priceless; however, sometimes in life we
have to put a price on it so we can gain that appropriate knowledge. I hope
that you think teaching history in a fun, informative, and different way is as
important as I do, and you will donate to this project to keep a fascinating part of history alive and even sparking a new love and interest in generations to
come.</p><p><br/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Is
it worth it?</b></p><div>
</div><p> </p><div>
</div><p>Of course, this can’t always be so easy, but as my husband
loves to say “you have thrown your ball over the fence, now go and get it!” and
I definitely mean to. Is there a chance that people will not find this cause worthy
of their time and money? Absolutely, but that is not going to stop me from
trying – this is as important to others in the end as it is to me.  There will be ups and downs along the way, I
am certain, and there is always the chance I won’t meet my goal – but that
doesn’t mean I will give up my opportunity at this internship. It wont be the first time I face a mountain of challenges and work, and it wont be the last, either. </p><div>

<p>Each year the Rotary Youth Exchange provides 8,000 <strong>high school
students</strong> from 80 countries<strong> a life-changing opportunity to live
in another country</strong> for about a month in the summer in the short term
program or for a school year in the long term program. <strong>While RYE is one of the least

funds for its Scholarship Fund</strong> to enable more worthy <b>Arkansas</b><b> students in our district</b> to have this life-changing opportunity.  No student
from our district will be given a 100% scholarship. <strong>We are aiming to raise a total of
$5,000, half through this campaign</strong> and half through our annual silent
auction at the Rotary District 6150 Conference, April 17-18, 2015.  </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The students who have experienced another culture tell it best:</p>
<p><strong>Finn from Wynne who went on a short term exchange to Sweden</strong>
says: I had a wonderful time on my trip to Sweden…. <strong>It was an
experience I will never forget</strong>. I got to visit buildings and other
historical locations that have been around long before America was even an idea, which I
found to be very cool. I got to learn about daily life in a different country
and celebrate a few holidays as well. In Sweden,
we walked and biked all over Stockholm,
and visited many museums.</p>
<p><strong>Lauren from Cabot on a long term exchange in Germany</strong>
says:  So far Germany
has been amazing. I landed at the Hannover
Airport on the 14th and drove for
about an hour to my city of Minden.
It's the cutest city with many old, old buildings.  I started school last
week and there are 7 Rotary exchange students there. So far I'm the only
""North American"" but there are 3 South Americans! I went to the first
inbound meeting last weekend.  We got familiar with the district rules,
got to meet the other students, and even got to perform and introduction for
our country!  This weekend I will be going to Essen for the first Rotex Weekend.<strong> I
will have to take the train which I've never done before! I have to ride
a bike to and from school </strong>and I've already fallen off, which was
a traumatizing experience. </p>

<p><em><b><em>Let’s help make these experiences available to all qualified students
regardless of their financial ability.</em> </b></em>They especially can gain so much
from the experience. We can’t do it without your help.</p><p>
</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</ul></div>","Summary
Each year the Rotary Youth Exchange provides 8,000 high school
students from 80 countries a life-changing opportunity to live
in another country for about a month in the summer in the short term
program or for a school year in the long term program. While RYE is one of the least
costly programs of this type, the cost is still beyond the ability of worthy
students.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Labor of Love UAE, Libraries for Labor Camps and the Society for Emirates Voluntary Activities have teamed up with the Welfare Department of ETA Ascon to help laborers at ETA Ascon's Musaffah camp.  We have started English language classes and now we want to build a library for these laborers.  We are taking donations of reading materials (see more below), but we would also like to include quality materials for learning English. </p>

<h3>Help me become a Waldorf Teacher!</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Hi!  I'm Stasha.  I'm a storyteller and mama and have been an alternative educator for many years.  I want to make a greater impact in the field of educational renewal and within the lives of children today.  I need Waldorf teacher training in order to grow as an educator and leader of educational reform.</li></ul>
<ul><li>I have wanted to be a Waldorf teacher for over 15 years.  I appreciate aspects of every educational system --from the public to the alternative--however, I have discovered that Waldorf education nurtures the life of the soul within the child, the teacher and the education system. And I think that soul in human beings and soul is education matters.  A lot.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Waldorf Teacher training is very affordable. I chose the training in Eugene, Oregon because it is the least expensive training center out of only a handful of training centers around the world.  It is a 2 year, part-time training at $4800/year or $480/month for 20 months.  However, I don't have the financial abundance necessary to cover this expense in addition to my monthly expenses of housing, bills, and my daughter's schooling. Scholarships and financial aid are not available during the first year.   </li>
<li>I'm reaching out to you for help!  Crowd-source funding has assisted MANY individuals and groups achieve their dreams.  Please consider helping me to achieve my dream by donating.  For as little as the cost of your morning latte, you are making an enormous contribution!</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>I've worked with children all my life - as a nanny in the US and abroad, then as a facilitator/teacher within afterschool and summer camps.  I've also been an assistant or co-teacher in Montessori, Waldorf, Reggio Emilia and nature-based learning environments.  In addition, I have created Waldorf inspired homeschool programs.  I have wondered --what makes a human being free?  I have also wondered what system of education truly creates well-balanced, intelligent, free-thinking, soulful, practical and embodied leaders in our world today.  I have found the greatest resonance with my soul-searching in Waldorf education.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Waldorf education is balanced, holistic and inspiring.  I see Waldorf education as a visionary and transformational movement facilitating educational renewal and bringing clear-minded, disciplined, intelligent, curious and creative young people into the world. I am aware of the challenges of being an educator today - whether one enters a traditional or alternative learning environment.  I rise with passion to meet these challenges today and am EXCITED to become an educator within a educational system that asks: what is a human being and what makes a human being and how do we educate so that the human being is free.</li></ul>
<h3><ul><li><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/39457/files/20130828155752-mama___mila_stone_soup.jpg?1377730672"" src="""" style=""width: 202.65780730897012px; height: 305px;""/></li></ul></h3>
<ul><li>I will become a certified Waldorf teacher within 2 years and will be able to teach within a Waldorf school anywhere in the world.  I will even be able to create my own school with a group of inspired families.  Anywhere!  My dream is to lead a group of first through eighth graders through Waldorf inspired curriculum in a foreign country.</li></ul>
<ul><li>You will be supporting my inner development as a human being and teacher - this is an instrumental part of becoming a Waldorf teacher - spiritual blossoming, deepening awareness and embodied leadership as a teacher.  </li></ul>
<ul><li>Your help will contribute directly to the movement of education renewal in the world.</li></ul>

<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3>
<p>Here's the Breakdown: </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>I need $4800 to attend the training.  That is $480 a month for 10 months.  If 100 people donate $5, that is $500 towards my foundation year training.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Depending on your level of financial contribution, I have exciting transformative language arts offerings. Please keep reading!</li></ul>

Hi!  I'm Stasha.  I'm a storyteller and mama and have been an alternative educator for many years.  I want to make a greater impact in the field of educational renewal and within the lives of children today.  I need Waldorf teacher training in order to grow as an educator and leader of educational reform.
I have wanted to be a Waldorf teacher for over 15 years.  I appreciate aspects of every educational system --from the public to the alternative--however, I have discovered that Waldorf education nurtures the life of the soul within the child, the teacher and the education system. And I think that soul in human beings and soul is education matters.  A lot.

Waldorf Teacher training is very affordable. I chose the training in Eugene, Oregon because it is the least expensive training center out of only a handful of training centers around the world.  It is a 2 year, part-time training at $4800/year or $480/month for 20 months.  However, I don't have the financial abundance necessary to cover this expense in addition to my monthly expenses of housing, bills, and my daughter's schooling. Scholarships and financial aid are not available during the first year.   
I'm reaching out to you for help!  Crowd-source funding has assisted MANY individuals and groups achieve their dreams.  Please consider helping me to achieve my dream by donating.  For as little as the cost of your morning latte, you are making an enormous contribution!



I've worked with children all my life - as a nanny in the US and abroad, then as a facilitator/teacher within afterschool and summer camps.  I've also been an assistant or co-teacher in Montessori, Waldorf, Reggio Emilia and nature-based learning environments.  In addition, I have created Waldorf inspired homeschool programs.  I have wondered --what makes a human being free?  I have also wondered what system of education truly creates well-balanced, intelligent, free-thinking, soulful, practical and embodied leaders in our world today.  I have found the greatest resonance with my soul-searching in Waldorf education.
Waldorf education is balanced, holistic and inspiring.  I see Waldorf education as a visionary and transformational movement facilitating educational renewal and bringing clear-minded, disciplined, intelligent, curious and creative young people into the world. I am aware of the challenges of being an educator today - whether one enters a traditional or alternative learning environment.  I rise with passion to meet these challenges today and am EXCITED to become an educator within a educational system that asks: what is a human being and what makes a human being and how do we educate so that the human being is free.

I will become a certified Waldorf teacher within 2 years and will be able to teach within a Waldorf school anywhere in the world.  I will even be able to create my own school with a group of inspired families.  Anywhere!  My dream is to lead a group of first through eighth graders through Waldorf inspired curriculum in a foreign country.
You will be supporting my inner development as a human being and teacher - this is an instrumental part of becoming a Waldorf teacher - spiritual blossoming, deepening awareness and embodied leadership as a teacher.  
Your help will contribute directly to the movement of education renewal in the world.



What I Need & What You Get
Here's the Breakdown: 

I need $4800 to attend the training.  That is $480 a month for 10 months.  If 100 people donate $5, that is $500 towards my foundation year training.

Depending on your level of financial contribution, I have exciting transformative language arts offerings. Please keep reading!


What is Waldorf Education Anyway?

Waldorf education is a humanistic approach to pedagogy based on the educational philosophy of the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy. (That's a mouthful!) The first Waldorf school was founded in 1919 in Stuttgart, Germany.
At present there are over 1,000 independent Waldorf schools, 2,000 kindergartens and 646 centers for located in 80 nations. There are also Waldorf-based state schools, charter schools, academies and homeschooling environments. 
The educational philosophy's overarching goal is to develop free, morally responsible and integrated individuals equipped with a high degree of social competence. Waldorf teachers are interested in students as individuals. They are interested in the questions:
How do we establish within each child his or her own high level of academic excellence?
How do we call forth enthusiasm for learning and work, a healthy self-awareness, interest and concern for fellow human beings, and a respect for the world?
How can we help pupils find meaning in their lives?

Teachers in Waldorf schools are dedicated to generating an inner enthusiasm for learning within every child. Even seemingly dry and academic subjects are presented dynamically and expressively, through stories and the humanistic ways of teaching. This eliminates the need for competitive testing, academic placement, and behavioristic rewards to motivate learning. It allows motivation to arise from within and helps engender the capacity for joyful lifelong learning.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute a donation at this time, please consider helping me by spreading the word.

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>We are a team of 26 undergraduate students from Western University in London, Ontario. With the help of over 800 student volunteers and 6000 first-year students, we organize and host the largest post-secondary Terry Fox Run in Canada and one of the most successful Shinerama campaigns in support of cystic fibrosis research in the country. Our team was founded roughly 20 years ago and our campaigns have been steadily growing in size and success. </p>
<p>We recognize that Western's Orientation Week provides us with an incredible opportunity to change the way we think about role of youth in creating change. We believe in giving back to something beyond ourselves and in uniting thousands of students, along with our communities, we hope to lead and empower others to join the fight against two terrible diseases that directly or indirectly affect everyone. We are shameless idealists; we reject the statistics that say two in three Canadians will battle cancer in their lifetimes and we refuse to accept diagnosis of cystic fibrosis as a death sentence. In the past two years, we have raised nearly $400,000 for cancer and cystic fibrosis research and this year, we are determined to raise even more. Through education, fundraising and community activism, we hope that we will see a cure for cancer and cystic fibrosis in our lifetimes.</p>

<p>Our team spends 5 months every year gearing up for numerous awareness and fundraising events that occur during Orientation Week at Western University - but, we operate without a budget. Each year, we start from scratch, turning $0 into $220,000 (in 2011) and creating a whole lot of awareness. Our campaigns truly rely on the generosity of those who support us and on the creativity and innovation of our student body. <br/><br/>Our team is broken down into 14 portfolios, responsible for organizing specific components of our campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Leadership Team (3 chairs responsible for managing the team and coordinating with the foundations)</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Golf Tournament (1 student who organizes our Alumni and Student golf tournament)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we do not have a budget to plan our campaigns with, our events and activities can only be as big as what we have in our bank account and depends on what kinds of materials and entertainment we can have donated. We try to spend as little as possible and keep a close watch on our finances to make sure we are getting big results out of every single penny. With your generosity and support, we can make our events and promotions bigger than ever, reaching a larger audience and encouraging more people to join our fight. This means we are able to donate even more to the Terry Fox Foundation and Shinerama. <br/><br/></p>
<p>$0.84 of every dollar raised for the Terry Fox Foundation goes to cancer research and for every year that Shinerama fundraises, 10 months is added to the life expectancy of individuals living with cystic fibrosis.

</div>
<div>
<p>We know that there are tons of people raising money and awareness for cancer research, however this disease is quickly turning into an epidemic. Our efforts may be a small contribution in the large scale of cancer fundraising, but the more our university raises, the more universities around Canada raise. Further, we believe our student body offers unique and creative ideas for fundraising and we hope to advocate for youth activism in a way that has never been done before. With your donations, we can grow our campaigns and change the way we think about the role of youth in fundraising forever. </p>
<p>Shinerama has made progress for cystic fibrosis patients in leaps and bounds, and our campaigns have long been the one of the biggest in Canada. Since Shinerama was founded, the life expectancy for children diagnosed with CF has risen from 6 years old to 47. In 2011, Shinerama campaigns by post-secondary students raised over $1 million across Canada and the organization is rapidly growing. At Western, we raised over $50,000 last year simply by pulling a 15 tonne fire-truck across campus and since 1968, Western alone has raised $2.98 million. Shinerama campaigns are funding life-saving research that is drastically changing the realities of those living with cystic fibrosis and every day we get closer to making CF stand for ""Cure Found"".<br/><br/>We hope our campaigns will educate students and the community about the realities of cancer and cystic fibrosis and persuade them that civic activism is crucial to curing these two devastating diseases. With your help, we can inspire thousands of people to make a commitment to the fight against cancer and CF and hopefully create levels of community involvement that will someday be capable of funding a cure. We also want to encourage people to look after themselves and their families, never take their health for granted and take preventative measures to ensure that cancer is found and cured early. We are just a small group of students, but we have seen our campaigns grow exponentially in the past decade and we believe that with support, we have the power to create something that will change our communities. Attitude is everything and Unity is Strength.</p>

<h2><strong>Important News about our Campaign! With only 3 days left to meet our goal, an anonymous donor has generously offered to double match every dollar donated to Esther’s Aid on Indiegogo with a double donation to Hurricane Sandy victims! So please donate today and you'll be helping our Heavenly Bakery students and our neighbors in need in New York and New Jersey as well.</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>…Who are We?</strong></h2>
<p>Esther's Aid for Needy and Abandoned Children is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to its primary mission to respond to the need of children orphaned by war and diseases, vulnerable girls, the poor, and the outcast.  In recent years our mission has evolved to include hundreds of poor women ravaged with poverty, homelessness and HIV/AIDS.   </p>
<p>Following the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which nearly one million civilians were killed, and many thousands of children left homeless, founder Clare Effiong came to Rwanda to witness the aftermath first hand. She was stunned by the complete devastation. It is here that our story begins. One day, while providing food to homeless orphans, Clare felt inclined to find out what these children truly wanted, more than anything else.   Most of course asked for food, safety, or medical assistance.  But one small, eight-year-old orphan, Wayesu Justus, aspired instead for something different: an education.</p>
<p><strong>Around this child’s one request, Esther’s Aid was born.  </strong></p>
<h2><strong>What Do We Do?</strong></h2>
<p>Since its founding, <strong><a href=""http://www.esthersaid.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Esther’s Aid</a></strong> has built learning institutions that allow many more orphans like Wayesu to thrive.  Our skills training programs provide students with the skills they need to make a better life for themselves. With the jobs they find after graduation, they are permanently lifted out of poverty.  And as for Wayesu – today he is the top-ranked student at his elite high school in Kigali and he hopes to one day study medicine in America.</p>
<h2><strong>How Do We Do It?</strong></h2>
<p>Esther's Aid provides children, youth, and poor women with tools for a productive life through basic education, skills and job training, and employment. </p>
<p>Since 2000, Esther’s Aid has:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Reached out to over 3,000 orphans and needy street children/youth/widows.</li>
<li>Rehabilitated and reintegrated hundreds of children, and opened a free primary school.</li>
<li>Established skills training for youth in catering,baking, and sewing.</li>
<li>Established the <strong><a href=""http://www.esthersaid.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67&amp;Itemid=85"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Heavenly Bakery</a> </strong>facility, and skills empowerment centers to create economic opportunity for youth and poor women in Rwanda:  <strong><a href=""http://www.esthersaid.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=55&amp;Itemid=67"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Arts &amp; Crafts</a>, <a href=""http://www.esthersaid.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=74"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Farming Project</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=""http://www.esthersaid.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=64&amp;Itemid=80"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Sewing &amp; Entrepreneurship Training</a>.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>This is Why We Need Your Help!</strong></h2>
<p>The van we use to deliver the baked goods from our Heavenly Bakery recently broke down and students are now forced to walk several miles on foot delivering bread around the neighborhood in Kigali. This is making it very difficult for us to fulfill our orders which have recently included wedding cakes!  We need <strong>$2000 to ship a gently used donated van</strong> from New Jersey to Kigali to keep our bakery profitable.  All profits from the bakery go directly to fund our programs.  And did I mention our van does double duty? <strong>When we're not delivering bread we use it to transport our elementary school children to and from school as well!</strong></p>
<h2><strong>How You Can Help and Receive a Hand Crafted Gift from Esther's Aid</strong></h2>
<p>Every donation counts– no matter the amount - so in advance , THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH for whatever you can give!  But take a look at the incentive gifts at the different donation levels.  Remember that your donations provide a hand up not a hand out!</p>
<h3><strong>Why Esther's Aid?<br/></strong></h3>
<p>Over 12 years ago, Clare Effiong, left a comfortable career as a UN diplomat to travel to Rwanda to help those in need.  With no more than $150 in her pocket Clare ventured out into a country that was unfamiliar to her, but within days she was making a difference in the lives of the orphaned and abandoned youth. many of whom were living with HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>The youth and women of Rwanda are rewriting their story, and it starts with education and economic opportunity.  Clare's intense passion and commitment to the people of Rwanda inspired me to get involved. I believe you will be inspired as well. By the way we have no paid administrative staff in New York. Every dollar funds our programs in Rwanda.</p>
<p>Please watch the short video we just made to see how your donations, big and small, can change a life from hopelessness and poverty to ""the life that has hope.""  <br/>- Carmen Paolercio,  Volunteer Development Coordinator</p>

With only 3 days left to meet our goal, an anonymous donor has generously offered to double match every dollar donated to Esther’s Aid on Indiegogo with a double donation to Hurricane Sandy victims! So please donate today and you'll be helping our Heavenly Bakery students and our neighbors in need in New York and New Jersey as well.
…Who are We?
Esther's Aid for Needy and Abandoned Children is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to its primary mission to respond to the need of children orphaned by war and diseases, vulnerable girls, the poor, and the outcast.  In recent years our mission has evolved to include hundreds of poor women ravaged with poverty, homelessness and HIV/AIDS.   
Following the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which nearly one million civilians were killed, and many thousands of children left homeless, founder Clare Effiong came to Rwanda to witness the aftermath first hand. She was stunned by the complete devastation. It is here that our story begins. One day, while providing food to homeless orphans, Clare felt inclined to find out what these children truly wanted, more than anything else.   Most of course asked for food, safety, or medical assistance.  But one small, eight-year-old orphan, Wayesu Justus, aspired instead for something different: an education.
Around this child’s one request, Esther’s Aid was born.  
What Do We Do?
Since its founding, Esther’s Aid has built learning institutions that allow many more orphans like Wayesu to thrive.  Our skills training programs provide students with the skills they need to make a better life for themselves. With the jobs they find after graduation, they are permanently lifted out of poverty.  And as for Wayesu – today he is the top-ranked student at his elite high school in Kigali and he hopes to one day study medicine in America.
How Do We Do It?
Esther's Aid provides children, youth, and poor women with tools for a productive life through basic education, skills and job training, and employment. 
Since 2000, Esther’s Aid has:   

Reached out to over 3,000 orphans and needy street children/youth/widows.
Rehabilitated and reintegrated hundreds of children, and opened a free primary school.
Established skills training for youth in catering,baking, and sewing.
Established the Heavenly Bakery facility, and skills empowerment centers to create economic opportunity for youth and poor women in Rwanda:  Arts & Crafts, Farming Project, and Sewing & Entrepreneurship Training.


This is Why We Need Your Help!
The van we use to deliver the baked goods from our Heavenly Bakery recently broke down and students are now forced to walk several miles on foot delivering bread around the neighborhood in Kigali. This is making it very difficult for us to fulfill our orders which have recently included wedding cakes!  We need $2000 to ship a gently used donated van from New Jersey to Kigali to keep our bakery profitable.  All profits from the bakery go directly to fund our programs.  And did I mention our van does double duty? When we're not delivering bread we use it to transport our elementary school children to and from school as well!
How You Can Help and Receive a Hand Crafted Gift from Esther's Aid
Every donation counts– no matter the amount - so in advance , THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH for whatever you can give!  But take a look at the incentive gifts at the different donation levels.  Remember that your donations provide a hand up not a hand out!
Why Esther's Aid?
Over 12 years ago, Clare Effiong, left a comfortable career as a UN diplomat to travel to Rwanda to help those in need.  With no more than $150 in her pocket Clare ventured out into a country that was unfamiliar to her, but within days she was making a difference in the lives of the orphaned and abandoned youth. many of whom were living with HIV/AIDS.
The youth and women of Rwanda are rewriting their story, and it starts with education and economic opportunity.  Clare's intense passion and commitment to the people of Rwanda inspired me to get involved. I believe you will be inspired as well. By the way we have no paid administrative staff in New York. Every dollar funds our programs in Rwanda.

<p>While we are confident in our ability to raise the money we need, if we don't reach our goal, the money we do raise in this campaign will not go to waste. There are many exciting opportunities for field trips in our home city of Philadelphia, and money raised would go to fund an alternative trip to an historical literary site here at home.</p>

<p>What do you get for helping us out?

Finally, from the bottom of my heart, thank you! You are making a difference in a student's life.  Who knows, maybe you've just inspired a student who will grow up to be the 21st century's greatest writer, or a future Nobel Prize winner, or first female president of the United States!

<h3>Our Story<br/>
</h3>
<p>   Intercultural Coalition for Family Wellness (ICFamWell), a small, totally volunteer-driven non-profit organization, was formed  to provide pro-bono counseling resources and other forms of mentoring support to under-funded, grassroots projects in South America, serving vulnerable communities.</p>
<p><br/>   In the past year, ICFamWell launched a Philadelphia initiative - La Puerta Abierta/The Open Door - which serves as a training and mentoring site for bilingual interns and counseling practitioners. They provide free services to families in the Latino immigrant community facing language, social, economic and political barriers. Interns and volunteer practitioners are trained and mentored through a “service learning model” and provide pro bono services in exchange for the clinical experience and mentoring that they receive. The hands-on training and mentoring that bilingual interns and volunteers receive through La Puerta Abierta prepares them to serve these communities, filling a serious void of services and support.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>  In the first year of La Puerta Abierta, we have received referrals and provided family and youth counseling to over 65 immigrant families across the tri-county region of Philadelphia. These are families who typically live in the shadows of our communities due to barriers of language, finances and documentation, yet still struggle with the same stressors as many families: intense conflict, stress, high risk behaviors in youth, depression, poverty, and overall hopelessness. We offer a place of healing and hope as we work with referred families to develop strategies to heal and prevent deterioration of their relationships in the face of their very real challenges. Our services are free, collaborative, confidential, and accessible, deeply respecting cultural and language differences.<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>
</h3>  We are now launching two groups in the Philadelphia immigrant community that will serve the older children of families who have been deeply impacted by the political and social challenges of immigration. These are youth whose struggles are complicated, even beyond the challenges that are “typical” of adolescence.  In the spirit of our mission, these groups will also serve as a training ground for immigrant, bilingual young adult co-facilitators who represent the communities that we serve.<br/>  In this expansion, we need funds for educational materials to be produced and distributed in both English and Spanish, expansion of our current space to accommodate a growing number of client families, and training and travel stipends for both facilitators and participants.<br/>  Our fundraising goal is $6000. ICFamWell is a 501-c-3 tax-exempt organization. All contributions are tax-deductible.

These are youth whose struggles are complicated, even beyond the challenges that are “typical” of adolescence.  In the spirit of our mission, these groups will also serve as a training ground for immigrant, bilingual young adult co-facilitators who represent the communities that we serve.  In this expansion, we need funds for educational materials to be produced and distributed in both English and Spanish, expansion of our current space to accommodate a growing number of client families, and training and travel stipends for both facilitators and participants.  Our fundraising goal is $6000. ICFamWell is a 501-c-3 tax-exempt organization. All contributions are tax-deductible. Please consider being part of the La Puerta Abierta family by contributing.For your contribution:

On top of that, 250 million children cannot read or write. The main bottleneck is the lack of educated teachers. UNESCO estimates that 1.6 million teachers are lacking in the world today. In addition, many children live in inaccessible places, as nomads, or in war zones, without the possibility to physically access schools. While the world is going digital, and 9 out of 10 Africans have <a href=""http://allafrica.com/stories/201601141364.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">access to a mobile phone</a>, education is lagging behind. There is a huge opportunity to provide education to everyone through mobile devices. We believe that through free, open source, scalable solutions, we can give children access to personalized educational content independent of teachers and classrooms, geographical location, language, and social and financial background.</p><br/><h1>Our Solution</h1><p>We are building an educational app targeting, in a first phase, children in rural East Africa. Focus is on basic reading, writing and math, and the app runs on Android tablets and phones. Our starting point was the Global Learning XPRIZE competition, but we are aiming way further than that. We are building an open source solution that will be extended to multiple cultures and languages in all parts of the world where we see children not getting the education they need and have the right to according to <a href=""http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Convention of the rights of the child</a>. </p><br/><p><b>Technology to build on</b></p><p>To reach every child we need the app to be adapted to different languages and cultures. We also want it to be extended and improved by engaged researchers, developers, designers, teachers and passionate people around the globe. We’ve carefully designed the structure of the app to make this process as easy as possible, including separating language and culture specific parts from the basic functionality.</p><br/><p><b>Make it relevant</b></p><p>From the very beginning our target group has been in focus. We know they often can’t access internet, so the app has to work under those premises. We know children with bad eyesight often don’t get glasses, so we made the design simple and clear.

These are only a few examples on how we are creating digital education that is relevant and actually work for these children!</p><br/><p><b>Social interaction and knowledge sharing</b></p><p>We want to take the learning experience outside of the tablet, and encourage the children to learn together. With a tablet or phone we have a brilliant opportunity to spur interaction by integrating features such as camera, speakers and voice recording, as well as communication between devices, in the learning tasks and challenges.

L:ara is an open source project, and together with the engaged community around us and its contributions we all will be able to give education to every child. This campaign is one small step in building that community, and you now have a great opportunity to become a part it!Call to actionThose €4 we all so often spend on a coffee can really make a difference for a child’s future. Education is the most important factor to lift societies out of poverty. Project L:ara is still in the beginning of a journey, but we know we can make a difference that will create ripples on the water. Now we need your help.
Back us! We will make your contribution count.

We have already received much interest from private individuals and organisations, and in particular, have successfully received funding from KTH Opportunities Fund. An article about L:ara was recently published in the magazine of KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div> </div>
<div>TWRC CREATES JOBS for women through the sale of exquisitely hand-crocheted dolls who wear the costumes of traditional Armenian regions- Moush, Zeytoun, Sebastia and others.</div>
<p>From the profit generated, TWRC will MAINSTREAM DISABLED CHILDREN in the Talin region by creating a disabled children's resource center to identify disabled children, their needs, provide information for parents, training to medical staff, physiotherapy and create a new community for families of special needs children. </p>
<p>Tim, Gayane and Brian care about Armenia and share the desire to provide Armenian children a healthy and positive lifestyle.  They want to create jobs for women in Armenia.  </p>
<p>And you can help.</p>
<h3>Why this project?</h3>
<p>Jobs for women are hard to come by in Talin just as they are elsewhere in Armenia.</p>
<p>There is a worrying lack of information available to the women on health issues, especially those concerning issues related to dietary needs, rights and other areas affecting women and children.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, doctors are not exempt to problems caused by the lack of information available in Armenia.  In one case, a local doctor told the parents of a child with a lazy eye he would be blind by the time he was 20.  The family was terrified for what the future would bring.</p>
<p>Something needs to be done.</p>
<h3>What we need...</h3>
<p>TWRC has received seed money to get a project identifying and mainstreaming disabled children in the Talin region on its feet.  Yet, there are needs:</p>
<p>a table and chairs $400</p>
<p>a color printer $250</p>
<p>an overhead projector $500</p>
<p>a car to get the kids to physiotherapy sessions $4,500</p>
<p>seed money to start a revolving fund for materials to make the dolls $1000</p>
<p>With $6,650 all of these expenses can be covered while also securing a solid basis for the project in the future.</p>
<p>If additional funding is received, TWRC will hire a regular project driver to include more children in the program, and compensate a specialist on child development that will visit Talin regularly. Furthermore, other issues relevant to the current living condition of women in Talin will be addressed. There is no lack of needs that can be addressed to elevate the women in the Talin region further up the socio-economic ladder.</p>
<h3>What helping TWRC means for you...</h3>
<p>Today there are six women working away at making dolls for you to receive as a reward for contribution.  Today, TWRCF makes 10 different women dolls:</p>
<p>Moush</p>
<p>Trabizon</p>
<p>Khotojour</p>
<p>Vaspourakan</p>
<p>Karin(Erzroum)</p>
<p>Zeytoun</p>
<p>Sebastia</p>
<p>Sasoun</p>
<p>Van</p>
<p>Artsakh </p>
<p>Each of the dolls can be viewed on the <a href=""http://www.talindolls.com/meet-the-dolls.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Talin dolls website</a></p>
<p>Shipment of the perks you claim will take place from the local Talin post office, right to your door.  The cost of this is included in the amount you contribute for the perk.</p>
<p>Our hope is that TWRC will go far beyond the goal of $6,650 and will mirror the succes of the recently launched <a href=""http://www.berdbears.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Berd Bear</a> project.  With the additional funding received, TWRC will be able to expand our work-- employing more women and helping new villages identify and mainstream disabled chidren.</p>
<p>TWRC expects to mail all doll orders from Armenia before December 1st.  This means you will have the dolls by Christmas (or at least the Armenian Christmas!)</p>
<p>Should TWRC falls short of their goal of $6.650(please, no!), we will still continue our project. However, the reality of decreased resources means fewer women will be employed and fewer children helped. </p>
<h3>If you can't contribute financially...</h3>
<p>Spread the word!  Link it on Facebook, Twitter, everywhere possible.  Tell your church, tell your local Armenian newspaper--  TWRC needs your help to get the word out.  </p>
<p>Just as the project is not only about raising money, but also raising awareness, so is this Indiegogo campaign.  TWRC is an ambitious, positive young organization, and deserves to be in the spotlight.  Helping to be a link in information sharing will allow more people in Armenia, diasporans abroad, and other concerned citizens of the world to know what needs exist in Talin and how they can be addressed in an effective, quality and low cost way.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>School budgets are major topic in every community.

This will allow them to continue to create and be inspired after they leave camp.  </p>

</p><p>In

program is grateful and will always be grateful for the current
contributions of its sponsors and patrons, however, the program does
understand that times change, and with ever changing economic
conditions, changes to current contributions can change for future
needs.

The pageant program has set a goal of $6,500.00 as
it prepares to organize its 67th
annual pageant program, in York, Pennsylvania.

Here
is a general outline of where the money would be going:



Facility
	rental
	– approximately $2,500


Crowns
	 ($750) and sashes ($450)
	– approximately  per year for 3 Miss and 3 Teen winners


Awards
	(trophies, flowers) -  approximately $1,000


Program
	books
	– approximately $1000


Franchise
	fees
	– approximately $800



Any
funds that are received beyond the $6,500 mark would be used
primarily to add to the scholarship awards that are currently
offered, as well as to costs associated with the operations of the
pageant: materials creation, helping to expand the program's reach in
the community, etc.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi,
my name is Megan Butler and I was born and raised on the Navajo Nation in Tuba
City, Arizona. Both my parents are full Navajo making me full Navajo. I just graduated with a Bachelors in Sociology at Brigham Young University in Provo,
Utah. I currently work at the Provo MTC Dining, which I really enjoy. Since finishing school last week I became the second in my family history to earn a degree. I am SO incredibly excited!</p>
<p>In
May I will be going to Mbale, Uganda to work on a community outreach project
with HELP International. HELP International allows for community members to
become self-sufficient instead of being dependent on others by incorporating
these community outreach projects. It will be my job to help them grow to be
self-sufficient. These projects are designed to target specific community
challenges and I will be working with HIV/AIDS patients. I am making one last push to raise money for my internship so I would really appreciate all the help I could get. </p><p>This is also a perfect opportunity for me to learn about starting my own non-profit organization. I have a burning desire to start a non-profit on the Navajo Nation. </p>

     and teach how to reduce the spread and maintain a healthy lifestyle</li>

an amazing internship off my list but I still need to take my science classes
for the MCAT. </p>
<p>I
realize this is going to be a long and difficult road but I know it will be

More importantly, these funds could be directed to assist cadets in need during emergency situations. <br/></p><p>For example, while McCreight served as Executive Officer at the ROTC department at Virginia State University, the alumni scholarship board there made frequent donations to cadets in need, due to personal hardship (house fire, divorce, etc.).

MissionCCASF rewards deserving sophomore and junior cadets with direct aid scholarships in order to assist cadets with meeting their financial obligations.Way Ahead As the Department of Defense cycles through another dip in overall funding, CCASF provides a direct link from alumni to young cadets to mitigate the loss of these scholarship monies. CCASF's short term goal for 1 February 2014 is to reach $1,000 in base donations for the 2014-2015 Scholarship Award period. Awards will be presented in April 2014 at Campbell University's ROTC awards program. The long term goal for CCASF is to reach $25,000 in overall donations. Once CCASF has reached $25,000 in overall donations, CCASF will transition to a self-generating $1,000 yearly endowment to the ROTC department indefinitely. Donations above and beyond $25,000 will allow the leadership of CCASF to react more  tangibly to the needs of the department and its cadets. Donations could be used, for example, to assist with department fund-raising or facilitate department purchases (uniforms for Ranger Challenge, Raiders, etc). More importantly, these funds could be directed to assist cadets in need during emergency situations. For example, while McCreight served as Executive Officer at the ROTC department at Virginia State University, the alumni scholarship board there made frequent donations to cadets in need, due to personal hardship (house fire, divorce, etc.). That is the sort of relevant, responsive scholarship fund we want to establish. To date, CCASF has successfully given $2,000 in scholarships to deserving ROTC cadets over the past two school years. All funds received will be applied to the CCASF donations for the 2014-2015 school year, funds received in excess of $1,000 will be placed in the endowment to mature. Past DonorsThanks to Brett McCreight, Bryan Kirk, Bracken Murphy, Chris Samples, and Special Forces Association Chapter 62 (Southern Pines) for their donations during our first two years of giving!Spread the word!We would sincerely appreciate it if you would forward the link to 
this site to any Campbell grads and folks you think would support our 
efforts here.Thanks for helping us to help the future leaders of the Army.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Why DreamMaker
Matters</b></p>
<p>You can support many generations
of America’s
finest young men and women in service to our country with a single, 100% tax
deductible gift this year. </p>
<p>Your gift will help to create a
perpetual, self-renewing fund unlike any other scholarship fund in America. The DreamMaker
Honor Fund truly earns the often-abused description of “Unique”. You’ll see why
when you view the video below.</p>
<p>The DreamMaker Honor Fund will
enable generations of these outstanding future leaders to earn their appointments
to their choice of US Military Service Academies without regard to their
family’s financial resources.</p>
<p>The Greystone Class of 2015 is
asking each of their families to set a goal of raising $5000 from each family’s
network of relatives, friends, business associates, and others. The Greystone
Board of Directors, along with a group of 70+ Friends of Greystone, is each
committed to a goal of raising $5000 from their networks of friends, family,
business associates, former military colleagues, and others. </p>
<p>Also, by posting this project on
IndieGogo, people around the world who understand the value of having the
highest quality young men and women serving in leadership positions in the US military
will have an opportunity to support their convictions directly through
contributions to the DreamMaker Honor Fund. A campaign that is successful at
reaching these very achievable individual goals will meet or exceed the goal of
raising $268,000.</p>
<p>As you watch this short video created by the Greystone class
of 2015 you will see why your contribution to this Fund will do far, far more
than simply help one or two students with financial needs. It will create a
self-renewing, perpetual fund in support of future Greystone classes, and
future generations of dedicated US Military officers. </p>
<p>This video will explain in the
students’ own words how this will be achieved, and why it is their personal
commitment that will guarantee the DreamMaker Honor Fund’s perpetuity. After
watching the video, if you would like to have more information, we’ve posted a
detailed discussion below. And if you still have questions, please contact
Greystone by phone or email. We are at your service.</p>
<p><b><a href=""http://youtu.be/37Yd1pf1NSQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/37Yd1pf1NSQ</a></b></p>
<p><b>Why Greystone’s DreamMaker Honor Fund Should Be A Priority Contribution
</b></p>
<p>Students come to Greystone after they have already applied
for an appointment to one of the five US Military Service Academies, and
received one or more nominations, but have been turned down. They have chosen
not to accept defeat, and have turned to the Greystone Program to empower them
to earn their appointment on the second try.</p>
<p>In the Greystone program’s ten years, 86% of Greystone
students have earned their appointments, and an additional 12% have earned full
ROTC scholarships to leading universities around the country. All have gone on
to serve with distinction.</p>
<p>The DreamMaker Honor Fund at
Greystone Preparatory School is designed to make
it possible for these young men and women who will not give up, and who are
determined to earn an appointment to their choice of the US Military Service
Academies to do so without regard to their family’s ability to pay. </p>
<p>As Greystone students have just explained, through a unique
financial mechanism available only to successful students at the five US Military
Service Academies, your 100% tax deductable contribution will be replenished
year after year, supporting not just one student with financial needs, but
generations of Greystone students whose driving ambition is to serve their
country.</p>
<p>If you are in a position to make a financial contribution to
any worthwhile cause this year, please consider how much further your money
will go in the Greystone DreamMaker Honor Fund,
and the kind of young men and women whose dreams you will be supporting.</p>
<p><b>DreamMaker Honor Fund
&amp; Conventional Scholarship Endowments Compared</b></p>
<p>If you have ever made a charitable contribution to a
scholarship fund, you know that while 100% of such a gift is always
tax-deductable, the fund itself must be very large in order to generate significant
revenues. </p>
<p>For example, in today’s financial climate, a gift of $1
Million can be expected to generate @ $5000 per year for use by the scholarship
fund. And once that $5000 is given to one or more recipients, it is gone
forever. The $1 Million may stay intact and generate income each year that can
be used for scholarships, but every time that new income is given to a student
it is also gone. Conventional scholarship funds can never grow without added
external contributions, and in fact will usually shrink in value over time
because of inflation, which is why college scholarship funds are continually going
to alumni and asking for contributions. </p>
<p>The DreamMaker Honor Fund will
never be depleted, and in fact it will grow over the years as successive classes
raise additional funds, which are then repaid by those classes as they reach
Third-Year status at the Academies. This means that unlike any other
scholarship fund The DreamMaker Honor Fund
will be self-sustaining.</p>
<p><b>How The Numbers Work</b></p>
<p>A gift of any size that you give to the DreamMaker Honor Fund at Greystone Preparatory
  school will have far greater impact than a
conventional donation. For one thing, you will not have to give $1 Million in
order to generate $5000 in scholarship funds. A gift of $5000 will generate
$5000 in scholarship funds immediately, and then that $5000 will be returned to
the DreamMaker Honor Fund by its recipient to
be given again and again to future generations of Greystone students. A gift of
$5000 given in 2014 will generate $35,000 in scholarship funds over the next 10
years, and $50,000 in scholarship funds every decade thereafter. </p>
<p>And by the way, we are using $5000 only as an example. A
gift of $500 will generate $3,500 in scholarship grants over the next ten
years, and $5,000 in scholarship grants over each succeeding decade.</p>
<p>No gift is too small to have a big multiplier effect!</p>
<p><b>How The DreamMaker Honor Fund Works – And Why It Is Unique</b></p>
<p>Greystone is a 501.c.3 registered non-profit so all
contributions are 100% tax-deductable, Anyone who needs to make a charitable
donation to reduce their 2014 taxes can choose the DreamMaker
Honor Fund at Greystone with confidence.</p>
<p>Unlike any other scholarship fund anywhere, where available
funds are awarded to a student one time and then are gone, DreamMaker Honor Fund contribution will be used
again and again to benefit both current and future generations of students with
a burning desire to earn their US Military Service Academy appointment.</p>
<p>This is possible because any Greystone student who takes a
Grant (not a loan!) from DreamMaker Honor Fund
promises on their honor to make a completely voluntary donation, in an amount
that they alone decide, back to DreamMaker Honor Fund
at the end of their Third Year in the Academy.</p>
<p>As an example, if a member of the Class of 2015 receives a
$5000 grant from DreamMaker Honor Fund they
promise on their honor to make a contribution of <b>at least</b> $5000 back to DreamMaker Honor
Fund out of the funds made available to them at the end of their 3<sup>rd</sup>
year.</p>
<p>Since this student will not be re-paying a loan, and since
they are under no legal obligation to pay back the DreamMaker
Honor Fund grant they receive but are making a completely voluntary and
independent contribution to the DreamMaker Honor Fund
in an amount that <b>they alone</b>
determine, this contribution will count as a deductable charitable contribution
that can be applied to their own tax obligations in their first year as an
Academy graduate serving in the field or the fleet.</p>
<p><b>DreamMaker Honor Fund
Grants Are Not Just To Address Financial Hardship</b></p>
<p>The DreamMaker Honor Fund is
not limited to students whose family’s financial need makes it imperative that
they receive a grant. Every year a Grants Committee composed of Class Officers
and members of the Greystone Board of directors will prioritize money available
from the DreamMaker Honor Fund as follows:</p>
<p>Students with severe financial need will be in the priority
group for grants from the DreamMaker Honor Fund.
The needs of these students will be met first. They will be classified as the
Priority Financial Need Group, and the Grants Committee will allocate funds to
these students based on the recommendations of Schreiner University’s
Financial Aid Office to ensure that they have 100% of the funds they need to
complete the Greystone program and earn their academy appointment</p>
<p>However, once the needs of the priority group are taken care
of, then ANY Greystone student is eligible to ask for a grant that will let
them shoulder more of the financial responsibility of the Greystone program
themselves. These students will be classified as the Merit Grant Group, and the
Grants Committee will consider each application on its merits, and will fund
each Grant based on the funds available, and on the short letter of application
that each student will be asked to write. </p>
<p>Although the families of students in the Merit Grant Group
have been able to ensure that their son or daughter has sufficient funds to
complete the Greystone program and earn their Academy appointment, members of
the Class of 2015, and of future classes, are becoming leaders who know the
meaning of taking personal responsibility. Asking for a Merit Grant to be
applied against their educational costs, thereby reducing the burden on their
families, is a responsibility that each member of the Class of 2015 has eagerly
accepted.</p>
<p><b>The Role Of The
Greater Greystone Family</b></p>
<p>All that remains is for each member of the Greystone family
to do their part in achieving the goal of raising enough money to bring the DreamMaker Honor Fund to a level where it can meet
all of its goals.</p>
<p>The Staff and Board of Greystone will be in close touch with
everyone working to meet their individual goals to find out how we can help. We
can write letters, make calls, draft press releases, identify potential donors
in your communities, and call on our extensive network of serving and retired
Military as well as Greystone graduates still at the Academies or graduated and
serving around the world for assistance. </p>
<p>We believe in our Class of 2015, and in their families, and
in the community of friends that the Greystone program has been blessed with
through the years.</p>
<p>Working together we will not fail.</p>

<br/><br/>Thank you so much for your recent donation.  Because of you and your generosity, Ashe Family Literacy will be able to continue serving the educational needs of parents and children in 2014.  We are excited at the response our Indiegogo campaign has generated;  however, since we launched the campaign, it has been brought to our attention that this form of fundraising has ramifications beyond those we intended, and we have been advised to close the campaign at this point.

<br/><br/>Please be assured that your donations will go directly to Ashe Family Literacy and be used exclusively for the purpose we stated:  to pay a living wage to our highly qualified early childhood educator.  This will enable the parents of preschool children who have the need and the initiative to complete their secondary education to achieve this goal, and will prepare their children to enter school ready to learn and to succeed.  The families who benefit from this program thank you sincerely for this opportunity.
<br/><br/>Thank you for your support of Indiegogo and its efforts to help individuals and organizations in raising funds to continue their good works and make the world better every day.

We are excited at the response our Indiegogo campaign has generated;  however, since we launched the campaign, it has been brought to our attention that this form of fundraising has ramifications beyond those we intended, and we have been advised to close the campaign at this point.

Please be assured that your donations will go directly to Ashe Family Literacy and be used exclusively for the purpose we stated:  to pay a living wage to our highly qualified early childhood educator.  This will enable the parents of preschool children who have the need and the initiative to complete their secondary education to achieve this goal, and will prepare their children to enter school ready to learn and to succeed.  The families who benefit from this program thank you sincerely for this opportunity.
Thank you for your support of Indiegogo and its efforts to help individuals and organizations in raising funds to continue their good works and make the world better every day.

Best wishes for the holidays!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

     parts of the Dominican Republic are not developed and there is a need for

     centers.  The Dominican Republic had identified early childhood
     education as a strategy to reducing poverty. However primary completion
     rate is only 80 percent. Lack of access to education is a
     contributing cause. <b>Statistics show that 25 percent of young children do

     us the opportunity to work with over 500 youth from around the world who
     will also be working with us to build schools in the Dominican Republic.  This is a 10 day experience that we will
     remember for a lifetime. </li>
<li>If we don’t reach

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Duke/Durham Saves is a student run organization dedicated to promoting financial literacy and wealth building. While we try to work with as many constituent bases as possible, we focus on Duke students, Durham youth, and individuals in the lower and middle class who may not have a savings account. We operate in many facets at Duke including teaching a class on Personal Finance, partnering with the Center for Advanced Hindsight run by Dan Ariely to attach metrics to our work, and the Duke Annual Fund and Alumni Affairs to make the transition to the working world easier for Duke alumni. We also partner with the Financial Aid office to run the PersonalFinance@Duke initiative and work with students on budgeting financial aid lump sum payments. </p>
<p>Within the Durham community, we work with the Boys and Girls Club to play the ""Investing"" game with and teach financial literacy to over 150 students. We will also interact with students' parents to provide family support that will aid in bolstering financial independence and education. We work with both the Self-Help Credit Union and Duke Credit Union to provide specialized savings accounts that we have negotiated with low minimum balances, opening charges, and reduced fees. We augment these savings accounts with automatic transfer policies and CDs as well as other investment vehicles that may support our population. </p>
<p>As we are a young organization, we currently have many other projects in the pipeline to continuously expand our proven efforts. In the coming months, we are trying to enter the Durham Public Schools to mentor children and use financial literacy as a means to complement math learning in a fun and constructive environment. We are working with the Alumni Office to create a ""Twitter Chat"" for alumni so that we can answer common questions about personal finance including couponing, finding apartments in new cities, and credit and investments. We are also trying to write a weekly column in The Chronicle, the Duke University independent newspaper. Finally, we are looking to host a luncheon focused on the community development activities of Self-Help and a larger conference whereby we can bring together some of the great minds in North Carolina regarding poverty alleviation to engage in frank and interesting discussions regarding different policies and their success. We are hoping to host this conference in April during Financial Literacy Month.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding is critical to our success at impacting decisions by our constituents. One of the greatest assets of our organization is our flexibility and limited overhead which allows us to distribute funds towards productive and cost-effective measures. Since we are a charitable organization and trying to maximize impact, we are only offering prizes for donations over $20 and those will be more towards promoting our organization than rewards for donations. We hope you understand our rationale and still support our cause.  We have numerous projects in the pipeline currently: </p>
<ul>
<li>Provide matching grants to youth and parents through our partnership with the Boys &amp; Girls Club. We are hoping to provide $10 donations that will accompany a $5-10 investment and enrollment in an automatic savings plan. We are hoping to reach over 400 youth using this program by May 2014. </li>
<li>Develop mobile and online games that we can use to help students and adults make more informed financial decisions. One example is a dynamic game involving negotiating a salary or for an item such as a house or a car with responses differing based on your choices. </li>
<li>Create tips and online lesson plans based on the Duke House Course on personal finance to be placed on our website and various other outlets. </li>
<li>Expand the reach of the PersonalFinance@Duke website. </li>
<li>Create a more expansive website to draw in more users. </li>
<li>Act as ""quarterback"" to local organizations dedicated to alleviating poverty and providing financial education. </li>
</ul>
<p>We are setting up several perks that we think will entice more people to join in our campaign: </p>
<ul>
<li>Each person that donates over $20 will receive a pair of Duke/Durham Saves green sunglasses. </li>
<li>First 20 people to donate over $50 receive the online personal finance class developed by our founder free.</li>
<li>Next 50 people to donate over $50 receive the online personal finance class at a 50% discount.</li>
<li>Each person that donates over $100 will receive an informational packet about and letter from a child whose matching grant you have funded. This packet will come once this project starts. He/She will also receive our Duke/Durham Saves sunglasses and the course materials from our class.<br/>
</li>
<li>Each person that donates over $500 will receive our glasses, the informational packet and letter, and an online personal finance class (valued at $25).<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Duke/Durham Saves campaign has the potential to materially affect both the Duke and Durham populations. This project increases beneficial relationships between not only students and local youth but also between Duke and our numerous partner organizations. It allows us to help build confidence in the community and provide meaningful change through both financial literacy programs and ""point of impact"" programs like setting up bank accounts, resiliency training, and other methods proven effective by extensive research. We are also developing gaming strategies that will continue to engage our constituents in ways that will increase their financial skills. We have already created successful programs with the Duke Federal Credit Union and Self-Help Credit Union that offer specialized savings accounts for our members. These include lower fees and minimum balances. Additionally, contributions to savings accounts through the Self-Help Credit Union go towards developing the local community. Finally, we already have signed up over 150 members to our group and are teaching a class to 12 Duke students about financial literacy. Because we are student run, we have low administrative overhead costs, which means your donations will go straight to the populations in greatest need through techniques that have proven effective over the years.</p>

<h2><em><strong>The kids build the boat...and the boat builds the kids</strong></em></h2>
<p>For the past decade Compass Project, a non-profit community-based program of Spurwink, has worked with hundreds of students throughout southern Maine to use boat building and rowing to provide positive direction to at-risk youth by encouraging the development of personal responsibility, community engagement, and environmental stewardship. Compass Project’s experiential learning programs integrate academic, job and life skills training with boat building and rowing to help youth stay in school, stay on track, and find new career directions.</p>
<p>Compass Project and Project Aspire and the Alternative Pathways Classroom at BiddefordHigh School are planning a two-semester collaborative boat building project to begin in the fall of 2013. This pilot program will benefit approximately 12-15 students who are eager for project-based learning opportunities that connect academic skills with real world applications.<strong> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">For this program to be implemented, Compass Project and Biddeford High School must raise at least $5,000 by October 10th.</span> </strong>After a successful pilot year, we expect the program cost to be incorporated into Biddeford’s budget for Special Education to continue a long-term collaboration into the future, and to partner with additional area schools to bring the program to even more area youth and their families.</p>
<p>Denise Doherty, a teacher with Project Aspire, says:  <em>“My goals are to open a new world to the students. Most of the students have very few skills in team work or applying academic skills to the real world or work. This collaboration could connect their knowledge beyond the classroom. They could improve math skills by relating it to boat building, and communication and team building skills by working with staff and students. Leaning how to use tools would greatly help my students gain hands-on skills that could benefit them in everyday life, such as repairs in their own homes, and increase their skills for employment.” </em></p>
<h3><strong><em>Why should you support this effort?</em></strong></h3>
<p>Biddeford has a rich boatbuilding history and a brightening future in the manufacturing and engineering industries. By engaging hard-to-reach students now in programs that will build their confidence, help them acquire and apply skills, and encourage the development of teamwork and communication skills, BiddefordHigh School and Compass Project will help these young people create a positive vision for their futures. <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Your support of this program is an investment in tomorrow’s workforce – young men and women who have the potential to thrive in the workplace and the community, but need an innovative alternative to the traditional classroom.</span></strong></p>

<p><font>The waves of the sea ebb and flow, coming upon the shore with great beauty and force only to recede quietly and secretively back into its own. Such is the ideology of post-Communist Eastern European ideology. Decades of Communist thought and ethics melded with an enforced Godless mandate has wounded the inner men and women of generations past, present and for the foreseeable future. These scars can be seen clearly in a societyâ€™s attitude and approach to disabilities, specifically in children with Autism.<br/></font></p>

</p>
<p class=""p2""><font><br/></font></p>
<p class=""p1""><font>For the past twelve years I have been traveling with teams to Odessa, Ukraine, the last four years of which have been to work in a school dedicated to teaching children with Autism.  It is the only school/facility we have been able to identify in Ukraine that serves the children with these special needs.  Taking Autism Specialists from the US to help instruct Ukrainian teachers who have little to no training and a modicum of success with these precious children of Autism and offering help for parents ill-equipped to relate to their children has been primary in our time in Ukraine.</font></p>
<p class=""p2""><font><br/></font></p>
<p class=""p1""><font>Fear, shame, exhaustion and hopelessness permeate each consultation with parents.  These parents love their uncommunicative, chaotic and incomprehensible children, though questions regarding the condition plague throughout the world plague them: Why? What did we do to cause this?  Will my child get better?  Children with Autism live secretively and alone.  Eastern Europe keeps disabilities, especially Autism, hidden from view in order to hide the shame, culturally and individually.  <a href=""http://cellarwebs.com/797/pledge-not-forgotten-the-movie/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">READ MORE HERE</a></font></p>

This 20 minute documentary, titled ""Not Forgotten,"" exposes the secret of Autism in Ukraine and what can be done to aid and educate professionals and parents.
Our primary mission? To aid in education of professionals who work with Autism in Ukraine and to create a support system for parents of children with Autism.
Our success stories with our mission? We have worked in the field of Autism for the past 5 years, taking professional and parents of children with Autism who are Americans and have worked with teachers both on the university level as well as in the classroom. We have successfully taught parents basic skills with living with and raising a child on the Autism Spectrum.

Decades of Communist thought and ethics melded with an enforced Godless mandate has wounded the inner men and women of generations past, present and for the foreseeable future.

campaign has a hard deadline of 11:59pm on February 14th.
If
you decide to help, you pledge whatever you want in exchange for cool rewards
(for example, a DVD of the documentary when it's done, an HD download, your
name in the credits, a dinner with the writers/producers... the list keeps
going on).
The
more you pledge, the better the rewards! Take a look at the column on the right
to see what's available.
If
we make the goal by the deadline, your credit card is charged what you pledged
(but not until then). We get to finish the documentary, you get your rewards,
and everyone's happy.  Actually, we'll be extremely overjoyed in getting to
get this project out to the public!
If
we don't make the goal by the deadline (falling even a penny short), your
credit card is not charged, we get nothing, you don't get any reward(s), and
Autism will continue to stay a secret in Ukraine.




Another way you can participate (other than backing this documentary) is to SPREAD THE WORD about it!  Share it on facebook, post it to a forum, tweet about it... anyway that you can get the word out about this project would be much appreciated.
Feel free to ask me any questions you have by contacting us on here or by www.notforgottenthemovie.com.









What We Need & What You Get

Our budget is $13,000 and all donations will be put directly into post-production of the documentary. As many of you know... costs to produce a film are enormous.  We still need funds to pay for the edit, the original score (by the talented Jurgen Beck), special effects and post-production backup.

We've had many generous donations by people who are inspired by the documentary and the filmmakers.  With your help, we'll be able to begin the free-flow of information on Autism from the West to Ukraine and begin to educate parents and specialists who are in desperate need of help and hope.

Rewards, Rewards, Rewards
Take a look at all the great rewards you get when you pledge to this wonderful opportunity.  You can claim anything from a digital download of the soundtrack to a paid trip to Ukraine to your logo on the film as a sponsor!

<h3>Who are we and why do we care?</h3>
<p>Ophea is a not-for-profit organization of almost 30 people (including parents, educators, cyclists, pilots, poets, yogis, bloggers, bakers and one wannabe Batman) dedicated to improving the health of children and youth across Ontario. For years we’ve been fighting for the release of the revised Health and Physical Education (H&amp;PE) curriculum so that all kids have access to quality H&amp;PE, including meaningful sexual health education. Three years after the revised curriculum was released (and a portion quickly revoked) students are still learning from a curriculum older than they are. We need your help.</p>
<p>Kids have a right to learn about their body and health in a straightforward way so that they can make informed decisions to avoid negative outcomes. Ontario students have a right to have a curriculum that meets their needs in today’s ever-changing world, made even more complex by social media, increased technology use, and a cultural shift towards a more open and tolerant society.</p>

<br/><h3>What is the situation?</h3>
<p>In January 2010, the Ministry of Education released a revised H&amp;PE curriculum that covers a broad range of topics including healthy eating, physical activity, substance use, mental health and sexual health.</p>
<p>In 2010, after misinformation was used to attack the sexual health education section of the elementary H&amp;PE curriculum, the Ministry of Education withdrew that portion of the document. A few months later, they also backed away from releasing the secondary H&amp;PE curriculum. Ever since, teachers have been using all or part of a 15-year-old document to teach sexual health and the other components of the H&amp;PE curriculum. We are well behind other provinces in the country and we owe our 2.1 million students more.</p>
<p>It’s time to bring the H&amp;PE curriculum into this century.</p>

<h3>I have been writing all my life.</h3>
<p>I wrote my first novel when I was in Junior High School, had my own zine before anyone knew what a zine was which I started as a freshman in high school, and have contributed short stories to small press magazines, as well as online stuff to the Huffington Post and elsewhere.</p>
<p>I like writing. It's part of who I am.</p>
<p>It's not all I am, of course. I'm also a husband and the father of three children (3, 8 and 11). And I am a non-traditional college student, going full-time and working full-time, seeking to get degreed in the field of Psychology.</p>
<p>But that itch to satisfy my desire to write hasn't dissipated, even as I pore over research and statistics, learn ANOVA tables and design methods for experimenting with human beings, and study in a somewhat different way than Dostoevsky intended, ""what it means to be human"". So, to balance out my psyche and fulfill ALL my interests, I decided to minor in Creative Writing.</p>
<p>That's where I saw the opportunity to participate in the very first Institute of New Writing\ Ashland (INWA) (<a href=""http://sou.edu/inwa/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sou.edu/inwa/</a>) sponsored by the College of Arts and Sciences at Southern Oregon University this summer. I had to write a biographical proposal to get in, plus submit my own creative material. In response, I was selected to participate in the Advancing Constructions of the 21st Century Short Story workshop, facilitated by local writer Vincent Craig Wright. It would be great to attend, but unfortunately...well, you can guess the rest.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>The good news is I was granted a scholarship.</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The tuition for the INWA worship is a little steep for me, given that I have used up my financial aid taking all kinds of mind-blowing Psychology and writing courses already this year. The College of Arts and Sciences were kind enough to grant me a scholarship of $100 in order to attend. Since the tuition for the workshop is $950, that leaves me with a deficit of $850 to come up with before the registration deadline of July 1. Given my familial responsibilities, I can likely come up with some of that, but not the full amount. That's why I am seeking your help.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>Any and all funds will go towards attending the workshop. Although it isn't expected, any excess funds will go toward financing my education next year. If I fall short of the amount needed for tuition for the workshop, and haven't made enough to supplement my goal of attending, any funds recieved will go toward attending the same workshop or a similar workshop later.</p>
<div><strong>You can check out my writing.</strong></div>

The best time would be the first couple months of 2015. I hope by becoming certified I can then go on and professionally teach what I love most. I will be studying in either India or Costa Rica. The exact date and program has not been decided, but by reaching the goals of this campaign I will have the opportunity to evaluate what will be the best fit for me personally as well as financially. By sharing this love with others, then they too can find the intimate connection I have found with yoga. Thank you so much for your time and for taking a look at my campaign! Namaste!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
