Sweet Briar College
Considered to be the most beautiful college campus in America, Sweet Briar has educated and enriched the minds and lives of young women for over a century.

If you have ever met a Sweet Briar alumna or current student, then you know the intelligence, character, and grace that is the signature of a Sweet Briar woman.

Now Sweet Briar faces a mounting challenge to remain open and we must act now to save her. 

Our goal is to dedicate roses to every Sweet Briar alumna. 
A Rose for a Vixen is dedicated to mobilizing the thousands of individuals around the world who did not attend Sweet Briar College but have been profoundly affected by Sweet Briar women. 

 


If your life has been positively affected by a Sweet Briar alumna, dedicate a rose to her. 


If your friend, relative, significant other, or great-great grandmother went to Sweet Briar, dedicate a rose to her.  


If you bumped into a Sweet Briar lady on the street and smiled, dedicate a rose to her.


If you support the mission of educating young women and want to help a future Vixen have this experience, dedicate a rose to her.

If you have a fond memory of time spent with a Sweet Briar woman, dedicate a rose to her.


*Please note the rose is symbolic and no physical roses will be delivered. All proceeds will be donated to Saving Sweet Briar, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation formed of Sweet Briar alumnae dedicated to saving the school and preserving the mission.

<h3>How You Can Help and What You Get!</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $15,000.00 during this campaign.  The funds will be used to provide scholarships for teachers to attend the 2015 Delaware Educators' Technology Boot Camp;  <a href=""http://www.delawareedtech.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.DelawareEdTech.org</a> </p>
<p>Early Bird Registration for each teacher:    $325.00</p>
<ul>
<li>For every $10.00 contribution you get a Thank You in a Twitter Tweet</li>
<li>For every $25.00 contribution you get a mention in a Twitter Tweet and a posting of your picture on our Facebook page.  </li>
<li>For every $50.00 contribution you get all of the above along with your name published on our website as a Contributor. </li>
<li>For every $100.00 contribution you get all of the above including an autographed copy of the Event Journal by one of our world-class educational technologist and your name published in the Event Journal.  </li>
<li>For every contribution over $100.00 you get all of the above as well as an invitation late summer 2015 to attend our Fall Gala (Venue TBA)</li>
</ul>Oh, by the way did I mention that all Contributions are <b>Tax Deductible</b>.  Yes, we are a nonprofit 501C (3) organizations with tax except status.  So every dollar raised will be used to host this event and register as many teachers as possible so they can attend the Delaware Educators' Technology Boot Camp <b>free.  </b><p></p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This campaign is intended to accomplish two (2) goals.  First, it will help or agency raise funds that will be used to sponsor and host an event that trains educators how to become effective educational technologist capable of adopting technology broadly for use in schools and classroom; administratively, practically and for professional development.   Second, the funds will be leveraged to help us attract other event attendees where the residual revenue will be used to underwrite our education and workforce development training programs.  </span><br/></p>
<p><b>You may ask why this Campaign is so important...I am glad you asked. </b>  In our small State of Delaware, certain communities are trying to understand why youth are loosing interest in school and dropping out at an alarming rate.  There are several studies that speak to the issue of young people dropping out of school and various reports offer recommendations that show the use of technology in classrooms and in after school environments has led to longer engagement, higher grades, better test scores and retention of young people in the education process. </p>
<p>But, our campaign is not simply about helping kids finish school as much as it is also concerned with <b>preparing and empowering educators to adopt new teaching methods and class engagement strategies that leverage the power of technology.  </b>Our business is educational technology and we want to share our knowledge and resources with educators who may have certain bureaucratic and or economic constraints that prevent them from adopting technological tools and solutions that can help them achieve greater success in teaching.  </p>
<p>We realize that many of our schools, teachers and administrators would love to have access to all of the latest and most sophisticated technology resources available to deploy in classrooms and to use professionally as another tool to ensure that every young person learns at the highest level of achievement.  But, in far too many cases the financial resources just are not there to allow procurement of such technology let alone to provide for the <b>Professional Development</b> an educator would need to fully adopt all of the technological resources that they felt would work best in their class setting and among their student population groups.    </p>
<p><b>As a member of the community we feel that everyone must do their part to help our schools and teachers become better equipped with the best technology resources available that will help our children learn and prepare for the 21st Century</b>.  Our after school and out-of-school programs must also be equipped with the <b>best technological solutions, coaches and instructors</b> that provide our children and families with access right in the neighborhoods and communities where they live.  </p>
<p>The magnitude of raising the contributions we are seeking is significant.  With your contribution we will be able to help <b>50 classroom </b>teachers gain free access to 3-days of intensive educational technology training that will expose them to a host of experts, access to possible grant funding to help outfit classrooms and or school buildings as well as linkages to a global network of practitioners that can provide future collaboration.  </p>
<p><b>These funds will be used to register educators from the neediest schools and classrooms </b>where thousands (1,000s) of young people will be impacted tremendously by the newly inspired teachers we empower during this hands-on Boot Camp learning experience and the subsequent new classroom resources that are sure to follow.  <b>Your contribution will help to make some school or classroom in our community ""Future Ready"",  and well equipped to prepare our children for the 21st Century and beyond.</b>   The contributions we receive will also be used to fund The E-House programs which will restart in the Fall of 2015.  </p> </div> <div> <h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></h3>

</div></div>","Summary ARS Arts & Culture Center is a local community art center, offering cultural & fine arts adult and children classes, summer art camps, and workshops. ARS teaches at-risk youth, and assists them in assessing their strengths, and determining goals.  These young teens learn through lessons about community, public art, and overcoming adversity by studying the history and life of Muhammad Ali. They also learn to express themselves through introspective writing, creating their own sculpture, and expressing their thoughts and feelings through artistic media. Educational documentaries about the IATG project are created to raise awareness and help to educate people throughout the community and beyond about the work we are doing in Benton Harbor.

WHAT YOUR DOLLARS PROVIDE
By giving, you will help us to reach more youth and to help give them not only an art experience, but a safe place to create after school.  However this project is about  much more than creating art.  Community is a big topic of discussion and how to become more involved, as well as lessons in writing, creating your own sculpture, and receiving positive attention, support, nourishment and art therapy.  You will also help us to get the word out to a broader audience about our I Am the Greatest Project through film.

toekomst!</b><p>
</p><p>Last van ontslag? Het
project “Ontslag, En Nu?!” beoogt <b>effectieve tools en middelen </b>bij mensen te
brengen die last hebben van ontslag. Zodat deze mensen <b>persoonlijk effectiever</b>
worden. Hierdoor creëren ze zelf kansen voor nieuw werk, met zekerheid en meer
vervulling. </p>
<p>Ik ben Victoria Waney,
loopbaancoach en schrijver van het boek “Ontslag, En Nu?!” en presenteer deze
campagne om de effectieve tools en middelen bij mensen brengen in SwitchCafés,
WerkCafés en In-Between-Cafés.</p>
<p>De effectieve tools
bestaan uit een <b>boek “Ontslag, En Nu?!”</b>, professionele <b>loopbaancoaching </b>en een
gedegen <b>mind-set training</b> door middel van cutting edge Theta-Mind Setting.</p>
<p>Mijn passie is om mensen
te helpen een nieuwe toekomst te bouwen. Dit gaat makkelijk door uit hun niet
meer helpende overtuigingen te vervangen met een nieuwe mind-set. Omdat een goeie
mind-set tegen economische recessies op kan!</p>
<p>Jij kan ook anderen
helpen een nieuwe toekomst te bouwen na gedwongen ontslag . Hun helpen om weer
in hun kracht te staan. Nieuwe kansen te kunnen creëren. En dit is goed voor ons allemaal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p><b>Help
job seekers find a new future!</b></p>
<p>The project “Laid-off, What’s Next?!” wants
to bring <b>effective tools and resources</b> to the people who suffer from their job
loss. To help them become more effective and personal motivated. This helps
them to create new opportunities for new employment with security and more
fulfillment.</p>
<p>My name is Victoria Waney and I am a
certified career coach and writer of the published book titled “Ontslag, En
Nu?!” (in Dutch) (or “Made Redundant, and What’s Next?!”) and am running this
campaign to bring the effective tools and resources to the people through
SwitchCafés, WorkCafés and In-Between-Cafés.</p>
<p>The effective tools and resources consist
of my <b>book “Ontslag, En Nu?!”</b> (in Dutch for now), professional <b>career coaching</b> (in
Dutch &amp; English) and <b>mind-set training </b>using the cutting edge Theta-Mind
Setting (in Dutch &amp; English).</p>
<p>It is my passion to help people build a new
compelling future. This is easy when we address their hindering old convictions
and replace these by a new mind-set. Because a great mind-set is
recession-proof!</p>
<p>You too can support people who want a
better future after their redundancy laid-off and job loss. Help them empower
again. This is for the good of the whole community.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<span>
</span>
<p>Het project heeft
minstens 3000 euro nodig om 2 SwitchCafés te ondersteunen om de effectieve
tools bij de mensen te brengen. De volgende stap is om een on-line training te
ontwikkelen om nog meer mensen te kunnen bereiken.</p>
<p>Jij krijgt waardevolle
<b>perks &amp; rewards </b>bij een donatie. Geweldige pakketten voor jezelf, of om
cadeau te doen aan iemand die in een ontslag zit! En dat je bijdraagt aan de
toekomst.</p>
<p><i><b>Hoe meer je kunt geven,
hoe meer wij kunnen doen in het project. Help ons!</b></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><br/><p>This project seeks 3000 euro’s to support 2

toekomst!
Last van ontslag? Het
project “Ontslag, En Nu?!” beoogt effectieve tools en middelen bij mensen te
brengen die last hebben van ontslag. Zodat deze mensen persoonlijk effectiever
worden. Hierdoor creëren ze zelf kansen voor nieuw werk, met zekerheid en meer
vervulling. 
Ik ben Victoria Waney,
loopbaancoach en schrijver van het boek “Ontslag, En Nu?!” en presenteer deze
campagne om de effectieve tools en middelen bij mensen brengen in SwitchCafés,
WerkCafés en In-Between-Cafés.
De effectieve tools
bestaan uit een boek “Ontslag, En Nu?!”, professionele loopbaancoaching en een
gedegen mind-set training door middel van cutting edge Theta-Mind Setting.
Mijn passie is om mensen
te helpen een nieuwe toekomst te bouwen. Dit gaat makkelijk door uit hun niet
meer helpende overtuigingen te vervangen met een nieuwe mind-set. Omdat een goeie
mind-set tegen economische recessies op kan!
Jij kan ook anderen
helpen een nieuwe toekomst te bouwen na gedwongen ontslag . Hun helpen om weer
in hun kracht te staan. Nieuwe kansen te kunnen creëren. En dit is goed voor ons allemaal.
++++++++++++++++++++++
Help
job seekers find a new future!
The project “Laid-off, What’s Next?!” wants
to bring effective tools and resources to the people who suffer from their job
loss. To help them become more effective and personal motivated. This helps
them to create new opportunities for new employment with security and more
fulfillment.
My name is Victoria Waney and I am a
certified career coach and writer of the published book titled “Ontslag, En
Nu?!” (in Dutch) (or “Made Redundant, and What’s Next?!”) and am running this
campaign to bring the effective tools and resources to the people through
SwitchCafés, WorkCafés and In-Between-Cafés.
The effective tools and resources consist
of my book “Ontslag, En Nu?!” (in Dutch for now), professional career coaching (in
Dutch & English) and mind-set training using the cutting edge Theta-Mind
Setting (in Dutch & English).
It is my passion to help people build a new
compelling future. This is easy when we address their hindering old convictions
and replace these by a new mind-set. Because a great mind-set is
recession-proof!
You too can support people who want a
better future after their redundancy laid-off and job loss. Help them empower
again. This is for the good of the whole community.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Het project heeft
minstens 3000 euro nodig om 2 SwitchCafés te ondersteunen om de effectieve
tools bij de mensen te brengen. De volgende stap is om een on-line training te
ontwikkelen om nog meer mensen te kunnen bereiken.
Jij krijgt waardevolle
perks & rewards bij een donatie. Geweldige pakketten voor jezelf, of om
cadeau te doen aan iemand die in een ontslag zit! En dat je bijdraagt aan de
toekomst.
Hoe meer je kunt geven,
hoe meer wij kunnen doen in het project. Help ons!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++This project seeks 3000 euro’s to support 2
SwitchCafés to bring the effective tools to the people. Next, the project will
develop an on-line training to reach even more people.
You will receive valuable perks &
rewards for your donation. Amazing packages to keep or give to somebody who
lost his/her job, while knowing you are helping your community too.

<h2><b>Wale Wale Kenya</b></h2>
<p>We
are Wale Wale Kenya and we run a youth center in Kibera. Through this
campaign, we want to establish an art &amp; media center where youths will be able to study, write and produce
music, film and other forms of art and media. </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1301222/files/20150316233129-IMG_4692.JPG?1426573889"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div><br/></div>
<h4><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Kibera</b></span></h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>Kibera is one of the largest slum areas in Africa.
Poverty, unemployment, lack of sanitation and security are issues people
struggle with every day.  On top of this, boredom and the lack of something meaningful
to do is often an enemy as threatening as poverty itself. In
combination with the close access to crime and drugs, it is hard for young
people to sidestep these destructive activities and to stay on the right
track. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Who are we?</b></span></h4>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The fundamental idea behind Wale Wale Kenya is to give young people access to a meaningful spare time and a chance to explore and develop interests and talents. At Wale Wale Youth Center youths come to engage in dance, film making, music and other forms of art and media. The youths receive support for high school and post high school education. On top of this the center is their own place where they can hang out and get a break from the stress of their daily struggles. <b>Our mission is to provide tools with which young people can build the life and future they desire.</b></span></p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h4><b>Why are we unique?</b></h4>
<p>Participation, ownership and transparency are essential elements in Wale Wale Kenya. We are well aware that we are not the only organisation expressing these ideals. Sadly enough
though, and according to our experience, few organisations in Kibera and
Nairobi actually manage to implement them. Wale Wale Kenya
is built upon the involvement of the youths and they play important roles both
in the everyday work as well as in managing the organisation.</p>
<h2><b><br/></b></h2>
<h2><b>Our Campaign</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Now we want to
build an art &amp; media center. A place where music, film, photography and texts are produced and spread for the world to see. The art &amp; media center will be a way to explore and develop creativity. But also a unique opportunity for the youths of Kibera to participate in debates and discuss issues that concern them. The access to social media, internet and the global community that many take for granted but is limited in Kibera, will be an indirect but important effect of the art &amp; media center. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  </span></p>
<p>More specifically, the art &amp; media center will be a place for:</p>
<p>- <b>Music -</b> through a basic recording studio and a few instruments give youth the opportunity to study, write, produce and distribute music.</p>
<p>- <b>Film </b>- by gathering equipment and knowledge, enable youth to learn and practice script writing, filming, editing, distributing and other parts of filmmaking. </p>
<p>- <b>Writing </b>- For instance through blogs encourage and inspire youth in different forms of writing and at the same time take an active part in the global media society.</p>
<p>- <b>Photography </b>- providing equipment to explore and learn photography  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h4><b>The Goal</b></h4>
<p>The budget for  the art &amp; media center is $6000. All of the funds will be put into equipment such as cameras, microphones, computers, recording devices, music instruments etc. </p>

We
are Wale Wale Kenya and we run a youth center in Kibera. Through this
campaign, we want to establish an art & media center where youths will be able to study, write and produce
music, film and other forms of art and media. 





Kibera


Kibera is one of the largest slum areas in Africa.
Poverty, unemployment, lack of sanitation and security are issues people
struggle with every day.  On top of this, boredom and the lack of something meaningful
to do is often an enemy as threatening as poverty itself. In
combination with the close access to crime and drugs, it is hard for young
people to sidestep these destructive activities and to stay on the right
track. 

Who are we?
The fundamental idea behind Wale Wale Kenya is to give young people access to a meaningful spare time and a chance to explore and develop interests and talents. At Wale Wale Youth Center youths come to engage in dance, film making, music and other forms of art and media. The youths receive support for high school and post high school education. On top of this the center is their own place where they can hang out and get a break from the stress of their daily struggles. Our mission is to provide tools with which young people can build the life and future they desire.




Why are we unique?
Participation, ownership and transparency are essential elements in Wale Wale Kenya. We are well aware that we are not the only organisation expressing these ideals. Sadly enough
though, and according to our experience, few organisations in Kibera and
Nairobi actually manage to implement them. Wale Wale Kenya
is built upon the involvement of the youths and they play important roles both

Now we want to
build an art & media center. A place where music, film, photography and texts are produced and spread for the world to see. The art & media center will be a way to explore and develop creativity. But also a unique opportunity for the youths of Kibera to participate in debates and discuss issues that concern them. The access to social media, internet and the global community that many take for granted but is limited in Kibera, will be an indirect but important effect of the art & media center.   
More specifically, the art & media center will be a place for:

Working in Kibera - risks and challenges

The vast knowledge and connection to the local community that the youths naturally possess helps in handling and avoiding issues connected to insecurity, crime and violence. 

Corruption and mistrust is prevented through heavy efforts in implementing transparent and democratic organisational structures where all members have insight and a say in every aspect and level of the organisation.

30-days (thirty) to establish a base of operations, the immediate relief scope

relief sponsored donation aid effort referenced. </p>
<p>We wish to convey that
private funding of your small non-government and non-not-for profit status is

concessions and form specific Purchase Order Requests to Covenant vis-à-vis the

<p>A revised reconstruction
plan for Vanuatu will require financial resources and time. We strongly urge
you to make a long-term commitment to Vanuatu by supporting this emergency
supplemental request and consider provisions that allow for a two-five year
window to designate and disburse funds based on the revised development plan
created mutually.  As more information becomes available, we will provide
further recommendations on the type of fund that should be created with
oversight mechanisms for the long term. </p>
<p>We appreciate the immediate

<h1>About Us - A Vanuatu NGO</h1>
<p>The government and development partners recognize the importance of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) for improving the well-being of human society. While they acknowledge the expertise of several NGOs in improving the socioeconomic conditions of disadvantaged people in Vanuatu, however, they are concerned over the capabilities of these NGOs to implement development projects.</p>
<p>There is a growing recognition among development partners that it is almost impossible to lead a development project to realistic and sustainable success without a capable partner. In order to fulfill this emerging demand, we have established DEVAN VANUATU, a Vanuatu-based NGO, in bringing project benefits closer to communities and mobilizing people’s participation. The establishment of DEVAN VANUATU is in direct response to the need for a dynamic and resourceful organization to deliver high-quality services to meet the emerging needs of disadvantaged people of Vanuatu.</p>
<p>We have assembled a core team of excellent and competent professionals with the capacity of producing outputs that add value to our clients and partners operations. They are drawn from a variety of disciplines including health, education, water supply and sanitation, engineering, information technology, environmental management, community development, marketing, accounting and finance. Our multidisciplinary professionals are committed to assist our clients and partners to achieve their short- and long-term goals and objectives. We are trying to establish a network of cooperation among DEVAN VANUATU and universities, educational establishments, research organizations, consulting firms and NGOs. We believe that if provided an opportunity, we have the capacity and capability to develop innovative, efficient and cost-effective solutions for improving the socioeconomic conditions of disadvantaged people in Vanuatu.</p>

Sadly, commitment and training alone won't get the team to Singapore. We've launched this campaign to raise the funds we need to send the team for the tournament, as efforts at securing local (government or private) sponsorship have not been productive so far. 


What we need and why
We need to raise the funds necessary to cover the cost of the registrations of the delegation, which comes to S$1,150 per person, which is equivalent to about 835 US Dollars or about 111,000 Sri Lanka Rupees. (http://www.wsdc2015.org/registration.html)

Since there are 6 of us, the registration fees come to a grand total of about 5010 dollars, not including airfare, which the team has decided to pay for on its own as it would be inconsiderate to rely entirely on external support. The $5500 goal is to cover the fees levied through Indiegogo itself.
For now, the plan is for the delegates to provide the necessary funds through any means necessary as there is a deadline that must be met to  assure the registration of the team, and then they will be reimbursed from the funds raised.
Every cent raised beyond our goal will go towards funding next year's team, which will be going to Stuttgart, Germany.


    Why this is important
English debate is, naturally, not the biggest field in our nation or the world, but it acts as a medium to propagate critical thinking, discourse and resolution of issues amongst those who are involved in it, unlike any other.

Events like the World Schools Debating Championships serve to propagate English debate across the world, and the more teams take part, the greater the effect is; the delegations take what they learn and experience at the tournament, back to their home nations to be spread in their local circuits.
 The people who attend these tournaments and the people in their local circuits will be amongst the individuals tackling the world's issues, either now or later in life. By supporting at least one team (and we urge you to support as many as possible), you are making an immeasurable contribution.
     
    Other Ways You Can Help We understand that some of you can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help!  Get the word out to your friends and let them know what they can do. Use the Indiegogo share tools!   Thank you so much for helping us out - you've gotten us that much closer to getting to the tournament!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Why Toronto?</h3>
<p>Toronto is the fastest growing city in North America, and it's enjoying a baby-boom.  A new generation is choosing to stay in the city, according to Stats-Canada, tripling the number of young families living downtown in the next 5 years.  From 2006-2011, the number of 0-4 year olds living south of Queen St jumped 55%.  Demand for family-focused and family-friendly services, products, amenities and lifestyle experiences is ramping up!  The ROM, AGO and Ontario Science Centre are great, but more suitable for older kids.  One in five Toronto kids have access to licensed day-care at the pre-school level...with even fewer options for those downtown.  So if an urban toddler is not in day-care, where do they explore?  Where do they get messy? Where do they build their brains?</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Children's Discovery Centre</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> provides our youngest citizens with a dynamic, hands-on environment for unstructured play and exploration.</span></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The 10 Discovery zones are each designed to foster imagination and free-play with a different aspect of life in Toronto.  Kids, parents/caregivers can wander in and out of each zone at will, with no set ""rules"" for how to play in any area.  Children are not directed to play in certain ways with certain items.  They are free to get messy and create what they want!</span></p>
<p>The Discovery Zones are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Mini-City</b>:  a small scale ""city"", complete with painted roads, street signs, tricycles, construction and a gravel pit.  Kids get active here!</li>
<li>
<b>Art Hive</b>:  crayons, clay, paint, easels, paper, squeegees.  Kids get messy here!</li>
<li>
<b>Make Believe</b>:  costumes, puppets, a stage, mirrors and mats.  Kids build characters and dance here!</li>
<li>
<b>Boom Room</b>:  drums, mallets, bongos, bells.  Kids make 'music' here, sometimes with household items!</li>
<li>
<b>Pet Vet</b>:  stethoscopes, doctor toys, lab coats, 'x-rays' and your own stuffed creatures.  Kids love animals and learn empathy here!</li>
<li>
<b>Eat Street</b>:  a mini-grocery store with shopping carts and produce PLUS mini-kitchens with stoves, pots, pans, aprons and utensils. Kids play with food here!</li>
<li>
<b>Campground</b>: rocks, logs, a canoe, magnifying glasses, tents and a 'campfire'. Kids explore nature here!</li>
<li>
<b>Imagination Station</b>: kid-sized large foam blocks in amazing shapes that lock together.  Kids build and create here!</li>
<li>
<b>Storyland</b>: books, colours, pillows and nooks.  Kids learn words and listen here!</li>

<h3>What We Need  </h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">We've been at this for nearly two years already. And while we've raised enough  to secure use of an actual, 20,000 square foot building in Garrison Point (beside Liberty Village), we need a bit more to FILL the place with all the right stuff:  the materials, the paint, the toys and the experts to ensure we're delivering on our promise </span><i style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">to inspire our youngest children through creative play.</i></p>
<p>In this campaign we are raising $80,000 to outfit the ten Discovery Zones of the centre.  That is, <b>$8K for each zone to go directly into the purchase and installation of the materials, equipment, decor, tools, textures and colours</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1360146/files/20150406123047-FloorPlan.jpg?1428348647"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If we exceed this goal, we will simply make each area even better, with funds directed at additional materials, more frequent fresh change-outs and higher-quality items.  </p>
<p>Our campaign IS flexible, however, and should we fall short of the target, we will still allot the funds to the Discovery Zones.  Our $80K target is based on our curated list of equipment and items needed for discovery at the centre.</p>

Toronto is the fastest growing city in North America, and it's enjoying a baby-boom.  A new generation is choosing to stay in the city, according to Stats-Canada, tripling the number of young families living downtown in the next 5 years.  From 2006-2011, the number of 0-4 year olds living south of Queen St jumped 55%.  Demand for family-focused and family-friendly services, products, amenities and lifestyle experiences is ramping up!  The ROM, AGO and Ontario Science Centre are great, but more suitable for older kids.  One in five Toronto kids have access to licensed day-care at the pre-school level...with even fewer options for those downtown.  So if an urban toddler is not in day-care, where do they explore?  Where do they get messy? Where do they build their brains?
The Children's Discovery Centre provides our youngest citizens with a dynamic, hands-on environment for unstructured play and exploration.
The Children's Discovery Centre will be located at  
45 Stratchan Avenue. 
Beside Liberty Village.  
@ the corner of Strachan & Ordinance, just south of King St.

What happens there?
The 20,000 square foot facility is made up of 10 themed Discovery Zones, plus baby-friendly quiet rooms and a feeding area, a snack cafe and a party room.


Mini-City
The 10 Discovery zones are each designed to foster imagination and free-play with a different aspect of life in Toronto.  Kids, parents/caregivers can wander in and out of each zone at will, with no set ""rules"" for how to play in any area.  Children are not directed to play in certain ways with certain items.  They are free to get messy and create what they want!
The Discovery Zones are:


Mini-City:  a small scale ""city"", complete with painted roads, street signs, tricycles, construction and a gravel pit.  Kids get active here!

Art Hive:  crayons, clay, paint, easels, paper, squeegees.  Kids get messy here!

Make Believe:  costumes, puppets, a stage, mirrors and mats.  Kids build characters and dance here!

Boom Room:  drums, mallets, bongos, bells.  Kids make 'music' here, sometimes with household items!

Pet Vet:  stethoscopes, doctor toys, lab coats, 'x-rays' and your own stuffed creatures.  Kids love animals and learn empathy here!

Eat Street:  a mini-grocery store with shopping carts and produce PLUS mini-kitchens with stoves, pots, pans, aprons and utensils. Kids play with food here!

Campground: rocks, logs, a canoe, magnifying glasses, tents and a 'campfire'. Kids explore nature here!

Imagination Station: kid-sized large foam blocks in amazing shapes that lock together.  Kids build and create here!

Storyland: books, colours, pillows and nooks.  Kids learn words and listen here!

First Discoveries: bright colours, soft textures, easy landings. The smallest kids crawl here!  Caregivers and parents share and connect here!

What We Need  
We've been at this for nearly two years already. And while we've raised enough  to secure use of an actual, 20,000 square foot building in Garrison Point (beside Liberty Village), we need a bit more to FILL the place with all the right stuff:  the materials, the paint, the toys and the experts to ensure we're delivering on our promise to inspire our youngest children through creative play.
In this campaign we are raising $80,000 to outfit the ten Discovery Zones of the centre.  That is, $8K for each zone to go directly into the purchase and installation of the materials, equipment, decor, tools, textures and colours.


If we exceed this goal, we will simply make each area even better, with funds directed at additional materials, more frequent fresh change-outs and higher-quality items.  
Our campaign IS flexible, however, and should we fall short of the target, we will still allot the funds to the Discovery Zones.  Our $80K target is based on our curated list of equipment and items needed for discovery at the centre.

What You Get for contributing
   We believe the best perk lies in exploring the new space!  So our perks are mostly designed to ensure those that open their wallets get to open the doors at the Children's Discovery Centre.  But there's also some fantastic events that go with the launch, and we hope to see you there!  
The Impact The Children's Discovery Centre (CDC) is designed for anyone with young kids under 6 years old looking for ""something to do"" or ""somewhere to go"" that is inspiring, engaging and educational. Not just the park or the shopping mall. It's a great new resource for young families...bringing new ideas in child education for:


moms and dads on mat/pat leave
families 
nannies and caregivers
school and daycare groups
grandparents
tourists and Toronto visitors

   Challenges  It's a big undertaking.  So we're tackling it in stages.  The May launch of the Children's Discovery Centre (CDC)  in Toronto represents ""stage 1"", as we inhabit our temporary space at Garrison Point, beside Liberty Village for a five-month run.  Then we'll move our concept and each Discovery Zone to a permanent home - still in the downtown core! Planning is happening now.  Success is a function of attendance and financial viability.  But construction is underway, and we launch this May!






It's important to know the CDC is a grassroots initiative.  All the effort, time and funding needed is coming from regular people and some great business leaders.  That means it's:



not government funded
not a corporately initiative
not a charity



Pass it along  

Regardless of any financial help you can give, please pass this campaign on to people you know! Use the awesome Indiegogo share tools or just forward the link to your friends (KidsDiscoveryTO). Together we can build something for Toronto families, something that's missing.  Something kids will love.
Thanks so much. Hope to see you at the Children's Discovery Centre!Feedback? Please contact us at urbarn@mac.com with any feedback & questions.

literally giving them a clean slate.  The
money they’ve spent on loan payments can go toward a house or starting a
business or simply living their dream.  This
is our BIG DREAM and we need your help to get there!
Any money remaining from reaching/exceeding the stretch goal will be used for subsequent years of operation.
BASIC OPERATING BUDGET BREAKDOWN:

The general consensus is that a
non-profit should spend 70% of gross income on its program or service and 30%
on staff, admin, and fundraising.  As a start-up, our numbers may be
skewed during Years 1 and 2, but we plan to be on track by Year 3. These charts depict our anticipated use of funds:


Each year, we will strive to become
more efficient, enabling us to spend more of our resources on the program
itself.  Most importantly, by Year 3, we will have a self-sustaining,
cost-efficient fundraising platform that supports the longevity of our
organization.  We’re up for the challenge of creating a stellar non-profit
that changes lives!

FAQs:

1)
Will my donations be tax deductible?
A: Yes!  MPOL is a newly
established not-for-profit organization incorporated in Illinois.  We are in the process of establishing federal tax exemption for MPOL.  The great news is that
tax exemption is retroactive, and we will be able to keep 100% of your
donation, even if exemption is not granted until later this year.  We
anticipate completing this process by early fall and sending a donation
letter to you by Oct or Nov for 2015 tax purposes.
2)
When will I receive my perk?
A: You will receive your perk 30 – 45
days after the campaign ends.  This will give us time to print the
t-shirts, canvas totes, etc., and ship them.  Thank you for your patience!
3)
What will the perks look like?
A: We are proud of our perk
products!  Please take a look below.


Our perk partner is Venley. 
Check out their site at wearvenley.com
4)
Is shipping included?

A: Yes, if you live in the US. 
For international donors, please add your specified shipping after you choose
your perk.
5)
How do I choose the size of my t-shirt?
A: No worries, we will contact you
before shipping.
6)
What if I want to donate, but I don’t want a perk?
A: MPOL appreciates your support for
our campaign and we welcome your donation even if you do not wish to receive a
perk. That just means 100% of your donation will go directly to our
program! 7) Who created the graphics and video?A: Our Team Members, Brittney 
Hurley and Lawrence Brown, created the video and campaign graphics.  They are super talented and thorough.  To contact them, click on the ""See More Details"" link under the video at the top of the page.  There, you will find all of the MPOL team members.8)
What if I wish to donate by check?
A: Yes! Please make your check
out to ""Mission: Paid Off Letter.""

<br/><p>I am delighted to finish my undergrad career this year and I have your support to thank. I feel blessed to have such a strong support group to keeping me motivated in my pursuit of my dreams. When I entered UC Merced, I created two personal goals that I would accomplish by the time my undergraduate career would come to end. One was to make a difference and leave my mark on the school, and the other was to study a semester abroad. I have accomplished the first one by being a Resident Assistant to over 200 students, helping to guide them in their transition into college and being their ultimate resource. My second goal, I will accomplish by studying a semester abroad at the UC Center London in Great Britain. By going abroad UC Center London will provide me with the unique opportunity to study British and EU politics in conjunction with interning with a premiere London establishment. By studying abroad, I will be able to effectively network on the international level allowing me to broaden my horizons personally, academically, and professionally.</p>

<p><b>Who am I?</b></p>
<p>To summarize myself
briefly I am a Southern California, first-generation student at University of California Merced. I am currently majoring in Management and minoring in Political Science with an emphasis on International Relations with the intent on earning my Masters in Business Administration. My ultimate goal is to break the gender barriers of the business world in Marketing and Communications and to continue my involvement in academia, leadership and mentor-ship.</p>
<p><span>During my tenure at UC Merced I have been able
to gain experience with developing creative processes, and managing events. My
project management </span><span>skills have allowed </span><span>me
to successfully organize and execute fun, engaging, and educational </span><span>events
for nearly 200 students. The results of these events have led to more community </span><span>involvement
and education about pertinent issues. As a </span><span>Resident
Assistant I was able to learn </span><span>how to better empathize with others to </span><span>motivate
them to take action </span><span>to </span><span>improve
their </span><span>roommate situations </span><span>or </span><span>help
them </span><span>become more successful. </span><span>I
was successfully able to transfer this knowledge </span><span>to
my </span><span>participation </span><span>in
UC Merced's Annual Entrepreneurial </span><span>Pitch
Fest. After presenting a unique </span><span>business </span><span>concept </span><span>to
a panel of entrepreneurs </span><span>and CEO's of Start-up companies, I was </span><span>able
to convince them of the efficacy of the concept I presented and was named a
finalist of the competition.</span></p>
<p>Additionally I have served multiple internships including Energy Service Corps where I was responsible for obtaining media coverage for

<p><b>My Goal for this
Campaign</b></p>
<p>I want to raise <b>$2,500.00</b> to
help finance my upcoming study abroad experience in London, England. I will be
studying in London for the academic semester (from August 2015 to

being informed, not believing it’s possible, not knowing how to go forth upon
this, etc.</p>

<p>I am the eldest of four siblings who mean the world to me. Though they are young, I like to take the role of big sister beyond just an age gap by being a role model for their future pursuits. As a first-generation University student I hope to encourage a path for them to follow and to expose them directly to the wonders of what higher education has provided me and will continue to provide me for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Coming from a mid-size town in Southern California, my horizons were expanded when my
family was able to host a foreign exchange student for a semester. This

explore the world and to obtain a greater understanding of different cultures.

<p>Currently studying as
a Management major with a Political Science minor, UC Center London will
provide me with the unique opportunity to study British and EU politics in
conjunction with the possibility of gaining international work experience. As a
Senior, I need one more class to complete my upper division Political Sciences
minor. The class from the UC Center in London that will fulfill this
requirement is Britain and European Union. I feel that learning
about the dynamic relationship about these two governing bodies would be the
perfect capstone to my minor degree that has been largely based on an International
Relations emphasis. I am also enrolling in the Internship
Workforce course which would allow me to intern for a premiere London
establishment. I have not had a lot of experience working outside of an
academic setting, so this course will be greatly beneficial for me. Not  gain professional experience that would help launch my career,
but I would also be able to reaffirm what I am learning during the internship.
Working in a unique environment will aid in a first-hand application of my
management major.  By studying abroad, I
will be able to effectively network on the international level allowing me to
broaden my horizons personally, academically, and professionally.  </p>
<p>I have always
appreciated British culture, literature, customs and rich history. Having grown
up during the height of JK Rowling's fame through the Harry Potter series, and
the regeneration of the classic Doctor Who Sci-Fi television series, I have
always been entranced by British pop-culture. Additionally as a political
science minor I am intrigued by the success of Western Society's longest
running monarchy. It amazes me that this tradition and form of government has
been able to adapt and withstand modern pressures with poise.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What I Need</b></p>
<p>Here is a brief
overview of how much my program is going to cost, how much financial aid I am
receiving, the amount of money I won through scholarships, and how much I will
have to pay out of pocket:</p>
<p><b><i>UCEAP Costs</i></b><b> – 2015 (Costs):                                                         <u>$16,266.00<br/>
Financial Aid:</u></b>     
                     
                     
                       
                     
 - <b><u>$3,750.00<br/>
Scholarships:</u></b>               
                     
                     
                     
              - <b><u>$10,439.00                        </u></b><u>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<b><u><br/>
Total Out-of-Pocket Costs:</u>             
                     
                     
          =  <u>$  2,077.00</u></b></u></p>
<u>
</u><p>Right now, I need <b>$2,077</b> to cover my remaining costs for
me to study abroad in London for the semester.  I am currently asking for $2,500 not only to
cover the remaining balance but I would use the extra funds for food, books,
and other remaining living expenses for England.</p>
<p>Honestly, the donation
you give me means so much more than the actual dollar amount. By you donating,
even if it’s $1, you are telling me that <b>you believe in me </b>and my
goals. That, there, means so much more than any dollar amount. Having a group
of people, even if it’s just one person, say, “Hey, Kaylin, I believe in you
and what you want to do in life, and I’m willing to help in any way I can,” <b>is
something priceless.</b> I know my experiences will be memorable, amazing,
and will be an invaluable experience that will help me grow both professionally
and personally.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can
Help</b></p>
<p>Any way you can
contribute in your own way will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>If you can’t
contribute/donate any money towards my campaign, don’t worry about it! I
completely understand. If you’re still interested in helping, though, please
spread the word! Tell your friends, family or colleagues about my campaign! I would also appreciate it if you would share my
campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, or whatever social media you may use.</p>
<p>If you have read any
of this campaign, shared it, donated, and or contributed in some way, thank you
so much. I really appreciate you for taking the time to do this for me.
Whomever you may be—family, friend, friend of a friend, former classmate, mentor, acquaintance—I sincerely
thank you for helping me be that much closer to reaching my goals and dreams. I
will update this campaign as I progress through my time in London and keep you
updated, even after the campaign has closed. Words cannot express the gratitude
I have for you and everyone. </p>

I am delighted to finish my undergrad career this year and I have your support to thank. I feel blessed to have such a strong support group to keeping me motivated in my pursuit of my dreams. When I entered UC Merced, I created two personal goals that I would accomplish by the time my undergraduate career would come to end. One was to make a difference and leave my mark on the school, and the other was to study a semester abroad. I have accomplished the first one by being a Resident Assistant to over 200 students, helping to guide them in their transition into college and being their ultimate resource. My second goal, I will accomplish by studying a semester abroad at the UC Center London in Great Britain. By going abroad UC Center London will provide me with the unique opportunity to study British and EU politics in conjunction with interning with a premiere London establishment. By studying abroad, I will be able to effectively network on the international level allowing me to broaden my horizons personally, academically, and professionally.

(Recipient of the Ruiz Prize in Entrepreneurial Communications at UC
Merced's Pitch Fest 2014)
Who am I?
To summarize myself
briefly I am a Southern California, first-generation student at University of California Merced. I am currently majoring in Management and minoring in Political Science with an emphasis on International Relations with the intent on earning my Masters in Business Administration. My ultimate goal is to break the gender barriers of the business world in Marketing and Communications and to continue my involvement in academia, leadership and mentor-ship.
During my tenure at UC Merced I have been able
to gain experience with developing creative processes, and managing events. My
project management skills have allowed me
to successfully organize and execute fun, engaging, and educational events
for nearly 200 students. The results of these events have led to more community involvement
and education about pertinent issues. As a Resident
Assistant I was able to learn how to better empathize with others to motivate
them to take action to improve
their roommate situations or help
them become more successful. I
was successfully able to transfer this knowledge to
my participation in
UC Merced's Annual Entrepreneurial Pitch
Fest. After presenting a unique business concept to
a panel of entrepreneurs and CEO's of Start-up companies, I was able
to convince them of the efficacy of the concept I presented and was named a
finalist of the competition.
Additionally I have served multiple internships including Energy Service Corps where I was responsible for obtaining media coverage for
ESC’s work in educating Merced County about the Green Initiative. Within this internship I worked with leading broadcasting companies in Merced County and worked as UCM's Young Democrat's media consultant for the 2012 guest speaker, American Political Activist Ralph Nader.

My Goal for this
Campaign
I want to raise $2,500.00 to
help finance my upcoming study abroad experience in London, England. I will be
studying in London for the academic semester (from August 2015 to
December 2015) at the University of California Center London via the
University of California Education Abroad Program (UCEAP). I also want to be
the example for future students that want to study abroad but face many
constraints that are preventing them from doing so, such as finance issues, not
being informed, not believing it’s possible, not knowing how to go forth upon
this, etc.

My Story




I am the product of a hardworking and loving family. Both my mother and father stressed the importance of higher education in my childhood. Together they taught me determination, integrity and that will a little bit of elbow grease, I could conquer anything. Gone, but not forgotten I wake each day to the memory of my father who passed away in 2006. Both he and my mother dreamed of a bright future for me and I have them as well as the love and support from my Fraternal Grandparents Penny Behnke, Chuck Dorothy, Glen Behnke and Beverly Hawkins, as well as my Step-Father Brian to thank for getting me this far. My pursuits could not have been possible without them as well as my South Dakota and California family.
I am the eldest of four siblings who mean the world to me. Though they are young, I like to take the role of big sister beyond just an age gap by being a role model for their future pursuits. As a first-generation University student I hope to encourage a path for them to follow and to expose them directly to the wonders of what higher education has provided me and will continue to provide me for the rest of my life.

<li>
<span></span><b>Support

<h3>What's In It For You!<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>There’s
more to it... we have great <b>perks</b> for your contributions too! Sure, as a
charity project the most important perk will be to <b>see your funded athletes
grow into the Olympians of tomorrow</b> – the 2015/16 class will be 20 years old in
2020, which is prime time for a sprinter to run fast: what a story would it be
if some of those 10 kids end up qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics! Anyway, look
at the perks list, we also have more short-term ways to say thank you!</p>
<p>Let me
also make one important disclosure, which has to do with the return on your
investment in us. We are sure your generosity will help us fully reach our
goal. But it wouldn’t be respectful towards you, our supporters, if were not
prepared to the possibility that we may fall short. In the spirit of full transparency we want to let you know exactly what we will do if that’s the case:</p><ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>The scholarships will be prioritised</b>, so anything raised up to USD 10,000 (roughly
GBP 7,000) will be channelled into those; we would rather have to cut on our
admin costs (see “other ways you can help” below on how you can actually help
us cut those costs) than to curtail our core goal of giving out 10 scholarships
in September.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>In the
(unhappy) event that we won’t reach even the scholarships amount, we will still
launch 10 scholarships but of a reduced amount. USD 1,000/year go quite a long
way in Guyana, and so would USD 800, or 700. Still, we very much hope it will
be US 1,000. But at least now you know what’s in our minds in that eventuality.</li>

</ul><p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>The Long Story<br/>
</h3>
<p>I figure
some of you might be curious to get a clearer picture on how this whole Athletic
Elevator thing was possibly conceived. So if you have time and feel ready to steer
towards the philosophical edge of this adventure, let me tell you more about
the story that led us here.</p>
<p>As I
said, I am a long distance runner by passion, an energy expert by profession
and a global gypsy by inclination. In prose, this means that I have a career in
energy consulting which led me to travel the globe. I am currently in transit
between London, which has been my base for the best part of the last 10 years,
and Colorado where I am about to take on a new professional adventure. Over
these years I also spent shorter periods for assignments in Washington DC,
Brussels, New York and Houston. For work or simple curiosity, without an actual
plan, I ended up spending time in all continents except Antarctica. <b>Global
gypsy enough? OK. As to running:</b> it has been my second skin for 20 years, and
of the big passions of my life it has been the most elusive; that is, the one I
always was unconditionally in love with, but which I always felt guilty for not
prioritizing enough. This is because I believe in the role of sport as a
metaphor of life, and an enabler for <b>philosophical understanding</b> and <b>education</b>.
As such, it has to be an amateur activity, a side gig, which is why I never pursued
the professional athlete route. At the same time, as work responsibilities and
pressure stacked up, I grew afraid that all this running around in circles on a
track and on the roads was only wasting my time and doing no good to the world.
<b>How exactly would the world become a better place if I clocked 2h15 instead of
2h19 in the marathon?</b> Would anyone’s life get any better if I did? Who else
would benefit, besides my own vanity?</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437331983/jhp80w0izk168vnij4o2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>But then
something happened. The sort of stuff that makes people say: things fall into
place. Actually, I am a sturdy rational thinker and don’t quite believe they do
so without receiving the correct incentives. You’ve got to work very hard to beat
cosmic entropy, you have to search deep, you have no assurances of success and
you have to accept that the efficiency of your efforts is less, much less than
100%. In other words <b>to catch the right train, even though you don’t know if it will
ever come, you have to at least be waiting for it on the platform</b>. The train I
wanted to catch was something that would make sense of this restlessness, this
feeling that I had a puzzle of a life which could somehow become a beautiful
figure but I didn’t know how. After all I spent 35 years hearing people tell me
that the intellectual and physical dimensions of life are irredeemably separate
things, and although my own experience hinted that it might not be such a
clear-cut story, who was I to challenge such a widespread view? 

<p>Another
complicating factor was that I was kind of good at what I was doing, but
nowhere near good enough for the global competition I had thrown myself in. As
one of many not so talented runners, <b>the solution was not to be sought in the
improvement of my mediocre standard</b>. I looked up at the likes of Wesley Korir –
I know, you haven’t heard this name before; when you live at the margins of
conventional life, you also end up worshipping unsung heroes – and I realised
that winning the Boston Marathon and then moving back to my home country, running
for parliament and changing it for the better was not really in the cards. If I
had a chance, I had to seek it in the mixture of unique experience that I had.
Those strange puzzle tiles, part of which I had been given, part of which I had
built. <b>I had to blend things.</b> Play my best hand. Sports. Management. A cosmopolitan
approach to life.</p>
<p>When you
have these sorts of thoughts, and you are the sort of guy that I am, you end up
browsing Google Maps late at night, asking yourself <b>“What good amid these? O
me! O life!”</b>. There must be a place in the world where even with my limited
means, I can make a difference. What sort of place does it have to be?</p>
<p>It has to
be a place where I can show up and say, here, now, that I have something good
to offer. At the same time it has to be a place where what’s on offer has to
get traction, there has to be a sensibility to sports and there has to be a
fertile ground for the importance of education in improving one’s life
conditions. It took a while of searching. I was perhaps making mistakes in my
approach. I was getting nowhere. But the best thing about making mistakes is
that you perceive a learning curve. Let me tell you a dirty secret about
exploring outside one’s comfort zone: <b>the sheer perception of a learning curve
has its own lifting force</b>. It seems very weak, an uninviting whirlwind, but if
you rely on it, it can keep you in the air for a while, while you try to set up
a more stable lift. And when it comes to the feeling of getting nowhere and
being exhausted and the finish line not in sight, that’s a marathon runner’s
bread and butter: around mile 20, it always feels like that. If you don’t have
a “shit, another 6 to go” moment around mile 20, all it means is you haven’t
pushed hard enough. You can address it in one of two ways: either you quit, or
you shut your demons off and keep going. If you manage the latter, you find
strength you didn’t know existed, you trick your body into getting through
another 3 miles, then you push hard with all your mental power through another
2, then you crawl the final mile, and in the end guess what: the finish line
appears. </p>
<p>So, exactly
according to schedule, after getting nowhere for long enough, <b>Guyana appeared on
the horizon</b>. A small country, where an individual could make a macroscopic
difference to a population. An English speaking place, which was paramount to
the concept I had in mind (more on this below). A place where education is held
in high respect and actually with <b>a high school attendance rate of over 60%</b>. And
perhaps most importantly for my own story, an Olympic Association which showed
interest in my propositions.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437332098/yecgcs8q8jkrsfzwwzvp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>After the
unbound nature of my mindset led me to scout as far as the tropical rainforest
of South America, I said to myself, enough for the cosmopolitan side. Now how
could I blend the remaining skills – sports experience and management expertise?

<p>Two ideas
came out. The first was to <b>help the athletes of today</b>. Guyana is not one of
those small nations who use quota places in order to appear at championships.
There are sprinters out there who are capable of low 10” in the 100m and 45” in
the 400m; depending on how much you are into track &amp; field, this will seem
to you between awesome and outright impressive – especially considering that
the first ever proper track in Guyana was inaugurated this April. More remarkably
still, Aliann Pompey won a Commonwealth Games (another one under the chapter of
unsung heroes. Look her up on Wiki). And there is a 40-strong representation
out in Toronto as we speak, for the Pan American Games. Guyana regularly sends
sprinters to the World and Olympic Games who qualify through the difficult
international IAAF standards. But they don’t have a sponsor. It shouldn’t be
difficult to find them a technical sponsor. This was the first idea.</p>
<p>The
second idea is the one we’re crowdfunding for right now. It is also more in
line with the philosophy of my approach to sports. As I said, I am in sports as
a metaphoric journey to a better understanding of life; sports as an enabler to
our truest nature. This is how the <b>“athletes of tomorrow”</b> branch of the project
was conceived. Small digression: my wife has just finished a degree in the US,
as a foreign student-athlete, fully funded by the track&amp;field team to
compete in the collegiate NCAA sports system. She had to train hard and she had
to study hard and those were tough years, but as a result, not only did she
slash her 5000m time by almost half a minute, but she was also able to earn a
US degree for free (and, for US readers who will be sensitive to the topic, no
student loans to repay). From here, the step was short: what if we could grow a
batch of Guyanese kids, during their high school years, so that they reach
their final year, which is the one when they can be recruited for college, and
they have an academic track record as well as sports performance level that
they can qualify for NCAA competition? And then we put them in touch with US
college coaches, who are in constant search for new athletes to fill their
rosters with?</p>
<p>Wow, this
looks like one big window of opportunity. This is also when Athletic Elevator
was properly born. With the help of a few friends, as well as the support of
the Guyana Olympic Association, we structured this project.</p>
<p>And in
the end... What good amid these, O me! O Life!</p>
<p>“Answer:
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.”</p>
<p>This is
the first verse.</p>

Let’s make it a poem. A beautiful one.<p><br/></p>

What We Do With Your Money
 

The

energy consulting which led me to travel the globe. I am currently in transit
between London, which has been my base for the best part of the last 10 years,
and Colorado where I am about to take on a new professional adventure. Over
these years I also spent shorter periods for assignments in Washington DC,
Brussels, New York and Houston. For work or simple curiosity, without an actual
plan, I ended up spending time in all continents except Antarctica. Global
gypsy enough? OK. As to running: it has been my second skin for 20 years, and
of the big passions of my life it has been the most elusive; that is, the one I
always was unconditionally in love with, but which I always felt guilty for not
prioritizing enough. This is because I believe in the role of sport as a
metaphor of life, and an enabler for philosophical understanding and education.
As such, it has to be an amateur activity, a side gig, which is why I never pursued
the professional athlete route. At the same time, as work responsibilities and
pressure stacked up, I grew afraid that all this running around in circles on a
track and on the roads was only wasting my time and doing no good to the world.
How exactly would the world become a better place if I clocked 2h15 instead of
2h19 in the marathon? Would anyone’s life get any better if I did? Who else
would benefit, besides my own vanity?But then
something happened. The sort of stuff that makes people say: things fall into
place. Actually, I am a sturdy rational thinker and don’t quite believe they do
so without receiving the correct incentives. You’ve got to work very hard to beat
cosmic entropy, you have to search deep, you have no assurances of success and
you have to accept that the efficiency of your efforts is less, much less than
100%. In other words to catch the right train, even though you don’t know if it will
ever come, you have to at least be waiting for it on the platform. The train I
wanted to catch was something that would make sense of this restlessness, this
feeling that I had a puzzle of a life which could somehow become a beautiful
figure but I didn’t know how. After all I spent 35 years hearing people tell me
that the intellectual and physical dimensions of life are irredeemably separate
things, and although my own experience hinted that it might not be such a
clear-cut story, who was I to challenge such a widespread view? 

Another
complicating factor was that I was kind of good at what I was doing, but
nowhere near good enough for the global competition I had thrown myself in. As
one of many not so talented runners, the solution was not to be sought in the
improvement of my mediocre standard. I looked up at the likes of Wesley Korir –
I know, you haven’t heard this name before; when you live at the margins of
conventional life, you also end up worshipping unsung heroes – and I realised
that winning the Boston Marathon and then moving back to my home country, running
for parliament and changing it for the better was not really in the cards. If I
had a chance, I had to seek it in the mixture of unique experience that I had.
Those strange puzzle tiles, part of which I had been given, part of which I had
built. I had to blend things. Play my best hand. Sports. Management. A cosmopolitan
approach to life.
When you
have these sorts of thoughts, and you are the sort of guy that I am, you end up
browsing Google Maps late at night, asking yourself “What good amid these? O
me! O life!”. There must be a place in the world where even with my limited
means, I can make a difference. What sort of place does it have to be?
It has to
be a place where I can show up and say, here, now, that I have something good
to offer. At the same time it has to be a place where what’s on offer has to
get traction, there has to be a sensibility to sports and there has to be a
fertile ground for the importance of education in improving one’s life
conditions. It took a while of searching. I was perhaps making mistakes in my
approach. I was getting nowhere. But the best thing about making mistakes is
that you perceive a learning curve. Let me tell you a dirty secret about
exploring outside one’s comfort zone: the sheer perception of a learning curve
has its own lifting force. It seems very weak, an uninviting whirlwind, but if
you rely on it, it can keep you in the air for a while, while you try to set up
a more stable lift. And when it comes to the feeling of getting nowhere and
being exhausted and the finish line not in sight, that’s a marathon runner’s
bread and butter: around mile 20, it always feels like that. If you don’t have
a “shit, another 6 to go” moment around mile 20, all it means is you haven’t
pushed hard enough. You can address it in one of two ways: either you quit, or
you shut your demons off and keep going. If you manage the latter, you find
strength you didn’t know existed, you trick your body into getting through
another 3 miles, then you push hard with all your mental power through another
2, then you crawl the final mile, and in the end guess what: the finish line
appears. 
So, exactly
according to schedule, after getting nowhere for long enough, Guyana appeared on
the horizon. A small country, where an individual could make a macroscopic
difference to a population. An English speaking place, which was paramount to
the concept I had in mind (more on this below). A place where education is held
in high respect and actually with a high school attendance rate of over 60%. And
perhaps most importantly for my own story, an Olympic Association which showed
interest in my propositions.After the
unbound nature of my mindset led me to scout as far as the tropical rainforest
of South America, I said to myself, enough for the cosmopolitan side. Now how
could I blend the remaining skills – sports experience and management expertise?

Two ideas
came out. The first was to help the athletes of today. Guyana is not one of
those small nations who use quota places in order to appear at championships.
There are sprinters out there who are capable of low 10” in the 100m and 45” in
the 400m; depending on how much you are into track & field, this will seem
to you between awesome and outright impressive – especially considering that
the first ever proper track in Guyana was inaugurated this April. More remarkably
still, Aliann Pompey won a Commonwealth Games (another one under the chapter of
unsung heroes. Look her up on Wiki). And there is a 40-strong representation
out in Toronto as we speak, for the Pan American Games. Guyana regularly sends
sprinters to the World and Olympic Games who qualify through the difficult
international IAAF standards. But they don’t have a sponsor. It shouldn’t be
difficult to find them a technical sponsor. This was the first idea.
The
second idea is the one we’re crowdfunding for right now. It is also more in
line with the philosophy of my approach to sports. As I said, I am in sports as
a metaphoric journey to a better understanding of life; sports as an enabler to
our truest nature. This is how the “athletes of tomorrow” branch of the project
was conceived. Small digression: my wife has just finished a degree in the US,
as a foreign student-athlete, fully funded by the track&field team to
compete in the collegiate NCAA sports system. She had to train hard and she had
to study hard and those were tough years, but as a result, not only did she
slash her 5000m time by almost half a minute, but she was also able to earn a
US degree for free (and, for US readers who will be sensitive to the topic, no
student loans to repay). From here, the step was short: what if we could grow a
batch of Guyanese kids, during their high school years, so that they reach
their final year, which is the one when they can be recruited for college, and
they have an academic track record as well as sports performance level that
they can qualify for NCAA competition? And then we put them in touch with US
college coaches, who are in constant search for new athletes to fill their
rosters with?
Wow, this
looks like one big window of opportunity. This is also when Athletic Elevator
was properly born. With the help of a few friends, as well as the support of
the Guyana Olympic Association, we structured this project.
And in
the end... What good amid these, O me! O Life!
“Answer:
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.”
This is
the first verse.

<p>All kids need to run around outside, but for our children, it’s so much more than just a playground.  To set our kids up for success, we need to give them the right tools for coping with their special needs.

This new playground will act as a safe tool aiding in communication, socialization and sensory issues for kids with special needs.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><i>What is the difference between what Arbitrage Ed offers, and what your bank, broker, etc offers?</i></p>
Banks, and other financial service companies provide educational materials with a conflict of interest. Whenever they create a lesson, they're factoring in the need to increase their sales, and that prevents a lot of good content from being published. Arbitrage Ed doesn't have this conflict of interest, because our main concern is creating free lessons, not making a pretty penny.</div>
<div>
<br/><p><i>How will Arbitrage Ed create an education that I can understand?</i></p>
We work closely with our users to insure everything is easy to understand. Additionally, every video will have definitions of key words so that you can maximize your understanding of every lesson.</div>
<div>
<br/><p><i>Why is Arbitrage Ed's education free?</i></p>
You deserve an opportunity to understand how to improve your financial security, and by offering free education we are doing our best to help. To charge you for such an essential education would be cruel, and would honestly break our hearts. </div>

<p><i>What do we we mean by ""research tools""?</i></p>

<div><i>What are ""additional resources""?</i></div>
<div>At the moment, we don't have the ability to create research tools for every lesson.

Additionally, it's where we post links to definitions of key words from each lesson.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><i>Why do we have Khan Academy Videos on our website?</i></div>
<div>Khan Academy created a fantastic series on inflation, and we are still developing our library of video lessons.

<div><i>How frequently do we publish new content?</i></div>
<div>At the moment, we are doing our best to produce at least two or three videos a week. That's because videos are expensive, and we don't have the manpower to move significantly quicker.

<p>Thousands of elementary school students across rural Anatolia
are facing kilometers long cold and bumpy roads regardless of unfavorable
weather conditions just to get an education. </p>
<p>“A pair of happiness”
project came to life to provide resistant shoes to low-income students who
can't afford a pair of shoes, attending rural schools across Anatolia, where
<b>7000</b> village roads were closed on January 2015 due to snow. </p>
<p>We are aiming to <b>GIFT</b> a total of <b>10.000
pairs of resistant shoes</b> to <b>75 elementary school students in severe need across
33 cities of Anatolia</b>. This project is the<b> first global project</b> aiming to
support poor children in Anatolia, therefore it will be a breakthrough if we
achieve our goal.</p>

<h4>The Need:</h4>
<p>Students from 1st to 3rd grade were chosen as
our target age group as they are amongst the most vulnerable to harsh weather
conditions and long commutes to schools. Children who will be granted with
these 10.000 resistant shoes, were already determined by the collaboration of
school officials, teachers and local municipalities. <b>We have received physically
stamped and signed forms</b> <b>from 75 schools and we categorized them by shoe sizes
in a spreadsheet</b>.</p>

<h4>The Fund:</h4>
<p>By $100.000 pledged funds and via other sources, we will mass produce and deliver 10.000 shoes to 33 cities directly by our team.

<p>The resistant shoes, feature sturdy soles and
are all water-proof. Sections of them up front and in the back were hardened
through injection molding to resist deformation. They were designed with velcro
straps so that children can easily put them on and off. Straps were
strengthened with an additional layer of leather. Inner-lining of the shoes
were made from ""tartan"" fabric that's used in seasonal shoes, which
provides sweatproof comfort during the months of Spring. </p>

Thousands of elementary school students across rural Anatolia
are facing kilometers long cold and bumpy roads regardless of unfavorable
weather conditions just to get an education. 
“A pair of happiness”
project came to life to provide resistant shoes to low-income students who
can't afford a pair of shoes, attending rural schools across Anatolia, where
7000 village roads were closed on January 2015 due to snow. 
We are aiming to GIFT a total of 10.000
pairs of resistant shoes to 75 elementary school students in severe need across
33 cities of Anatolia. This project is the first global project aiming to
support poor children in Anatolia, therefore it will be a breakthrough if we
achieve our goal.


Road Map:
 
The Need:
Students from 1st to 3rd grade were chosen as
our target age group as they are amongst the most vulnerable to harsh weather
conditions and long commutes to schools. Children who will be granted with
these 10.000 resistant shoes, were already determined by the collaboration of
school officials, teachers and local municipalities. We have received physically
stamped and signed forms from 75 schools and we categorized them by shoe sizes
in a spreadsheet.


The Fund:
By $100.000 pledged funds and via other sources, we will mass produce and deliver 10.000 shoes to 33 cities directly by our team.
Photos and videos will be available upon deliveries on www.insaninternational.org/apairofhappiness
The Shoes:
The resistant shoes, feature sturdy soles and
are all water-proof. Sections of them up front and in the back were hardened
through injection molding to resist deformation. They were designed with velcro
straps so that children can easily put them on and off. Straps were
strengthened with an additional layer of leather. Inner-lining of the shoes
were made from ""tartan"" fabric that's used in seasonal shoes, which
provides sweatproof comfort during the months of Spring. 

Each $10 means 1 pair of Shoes. 
Each donor’s name and donation (if he/she accepts) will be listed on project website which will be alive even after the project mission is completed. We will also share the name of the donors to school teachers for them to share and remember.
If we can't reach our goal, the funds will be donated to Insan non-profit organisation to save the lives of 20 children listed in www.insaninternational.org

Keep checking our Indiegogo campaign and social pages to learn about new Notum initiatives as soon as they come out, and if you have suggestions on how to get more people involved don't forget to share them with us for a chance to win free access to all stories on Notum!


Other Ways You Can Help

If you love the project but don't have the financial means to contribute, don't worry – no-one could understand you better than us!
Luckily, Notum needs visibility and enthusiastic people just as much as it needs funding, so spread the word with your friends, relatives, colleagues, professors, students, annoying neighboors, favorite waiters/waitresses, you name it!
Also, we love receiving feedback and believe it is another great – and often under underrated – way to help, so if you have comments – both good and bad – please don't keep them to yourself, we can't wait to hear what you have to say!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

 Here's a quick summary of our program and needs:  DeafYoga Foundation is a 100% volunteer-based 501c3 nonprofit organization.
Since 2008 DYF has been interpreting the Sivananda Yoga Teacher Training Course TTC into ASL.
21 Deaf people have graduated from this course TTC & are yoga teachers. 3 Deaf yogis are participating in this year's TTC May 31- June 28, 2015. 15-20 interpreters are needed throughout this month-long training. To date, we only have 5 signed up to volunteer. That means we need funds to help offer interpreters financial support.
 60+ interpreters have volunteered their time and travel expenses previously. This year we are fundraising in order to offer something back to the interpreters.

We Are</h2>
<p>All Wheels Up is the only organization working to
crash test wheelchairs for commercial flight so people who use Wheelchairs can
fly from the safety of their chairs.</p>
<p>We were created in 2011 by a Mother determined to
help her Son with Spinal Muscular Atrophy be able to travel after experiencing
how difficult it is to travel by plane with a Son who uses a Wheelchair. Our
team came together from our own experiences and determination trying to fly and we
have been working nonstop to help everybody who uses Wheelchairs one day be
able to travel from the safety of their Wheelchairs to all the amazing places of
the world.</p>
<p>There are 4 million people in the United States (according
to the latest <a href=""http://www.census.gov/people/disability/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Census</a>), 5 million people in Europe, and millions more around the
world who use wheelchairs and having Accessible Planes would mean incredible freedom for them and their families.</p>
<p>After researching the entire Air Travel Industry,
Regulations, and Process of Flying with an Electric Wheelchair for the last few
years, we know it is possible for people who use Wheelchairs to fly on Airplanes from the safety of
their chairs with existing technology and hope to show proof of concept to the
Airlines, FAA, and Airplane Manufacturers that it can be done. </p>
<p>This will help everyone involved in Air Travel- it
will allow the Airlines to reach into a massive untapped market of millions of
customers who never fly, save them millions in Wheelchair Repairs they pay each
year, save valuable labor for the baggage handlers, create billions for the
Airlines, Travel Industry, Tourism Industry, and Hotel Industry, and give
individuals who use wheelchairs and their families freedom to travel anywhere
in the world.</p><p>People with Disabilities in the United States spend an estimated <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/27disabled.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">$15 billion</a> annually on travel. You can read more stats <a href=""http://opendoorsnfp.org/market-studies/research-papers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<h1><b>What
We Are Raising Money For</b></h1>
<p>We are looking to fundraise $15,000 for one day of Wheelchair
Crash Tests with Calspan which is an FAA approved aerospace crash test facility.
With the data collected in these crash tests, the government data we have
secured from other crash tests done on wheelchairs for buses and automobiles,
and FAA regulations, we will create a Wheelchair Crash Test Model. </p>
<p>This will also cover the cost of travel for one
member of our organization to the facility to document and witness the testing</p>
<p>We have already received generous equipment donations
for the Crash Test from such companies as Q’straint which is the world leader
in Wheelchair Restraints, Intellectual data donated by SEA industries, and
others donations.</p>
<p>What we hope to achieve with this project is proof
of concept that wheelchairs can withstand the FAA Crash Test of 16 G – just as
they have already passed for crash tests in vehicles.  </p>
<p>We will give data to the FAA, Congress, Airlines,
Airplane Manufacturers, Universities specializing in Aviation Testing, and
organizations specializing in Wheelchair Safety.  </p>
<p>We hope the FAA and Congress will release funding
for more in depth research with organizations such as the FAA and
Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America
(RESNA), The National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research
(NIDRR), and the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Wheelchair
Transportation Safety (RERC WTS). </p>
<p>We also hope to work directly with Airplane
Manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing and Airplane Interior Manufacturers
such as B/E Aerospace.</p>
<p>We hope this campaign will get us to our goal and
help us get one step closer to people who use Wheelchairs being able to fly on Airplanes from the safety of their chairs. We
are a 501c3 Nonprofit so all donations are Tax Deductible.</p>
<h1><b>Long
Term Goal</b></h1>
<p>Individuals who use Wheelchairs can ride Trains, Boats, Subways, Buses, Cars, and
even Ride Sharing from the safety of their chairs right now, but not Airplanes.</p>
<p>Right now, flying with a Wheelchair is a nightmare
especially if someone has a neuromuscular disease severely diminishing their strength. They have to get out of their wheelchair, which literally is their legs,
at the gate and transfer into an aisle chair to get on to the plane before
transferring one more time into the airplane seat. They have to sit for the
entire flight without the medically necessary back supports, cushion, safety
restraints, foot plates, breathing equipment, or feeding equipment their wheelchair might have. Some of them even have to be held upright during takeoff
and landings if they do not have the strength.</p>
<p>When they finally arrive at the destination, they have
to worry about if their wheelchair gets damaged and, more often than not, it
does get damaged even if they have done everything to protect it such as taking
off the headrest and joystick at the gate. We have heard from people of their
wheelchairs getting completely broken and even sent to the wrong airport if you
can believe it. This hurts the airlines as well because they have to pay
millions in repairs every year.</p>
<p>We have many images of flying with a
wheelchair on our Image Gallery and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/All-Wheels-Up-Inc/146552878747745?"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/allwheelsup"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a> pages.</p><div>

</div>Ironically the other parts of flying for someone who uses a
Wheelchair are not a problem and there are advancements like <a href=""http://www.disabledgo.com/blog/2015/05/easyjet-to-fit-planes-with-wheelchair-accessible-toilet/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Accessible Bathrooms</a> rapidly approaching. You can also rent Accessible Vans and get
Accessible Hotel Rooms all around the world. <p></p>

We Are
All Wheels Up is the only organization working to
crash test wheelchairs for commercial flight so people who use Wheelchairs can
fly from the safety of their chairs.
We were created in 2011 by a Mother determined to
help her Son with Spinal Muscular Atrophy be able to travel after experiencing
how difficult it is to travel by plane with a Son who uses a Wheelchair. Our
team came together from our own experiences and determination trying to fly and we
have been working nonstop to help everybody who uses Wheelchairs one day be
able to travel from the safety of their Wheelchairs to all the amazing places of
the world.
There are 4 million people in the United States (according
to the latest Census), 5 million people in Europe, and millions more around the
world who use wheelchairs and having Accessible Planes would mean incredible freedom for them and their families.
After researching the entire Air Travel Industry,
Regulations, and Process of Flying with an Electric Wheelchair for the last few
years, we know it is possible for people who use Wheelchairs to fly on Airplanes from the safety of
their chairs with existing technology and hope to show proof of concept to the
Airlines, FAA, and Airplane Manufacturers that it can be done. 
This will help everyone involved in Air Travel- it
will allow the Airlines to reach into a massive untapped market of millions of
customers who never fly, save them millions in Wheelchair Repairs they pay each
year, save valuable labor for the baggage handlers, create billions for the
Airlines, Travel Industry, Tourism Industry, and Hotel Industry, and give
individuals who use wheelchairs and their families freedom to travel anywhere
in the world.People with Disabilities in the United States spend an estimated $15 billion annually on travel. You can read more stats here.
What
We Are Raising Money For
We are looking to fundraise $15,000 for one day of Wheelchair
Crash Tests with Calspan which is an FAA approved aerospace crash test facility.
With the data collected in these crash tests, the government data we have
secured from other crash tests done on wheelchairs for buses and automobiles,
and FAA regulations, we will create a Wheelchair Crash Test Model. 
This will also cover the cost of travel for one
member of our organization to the facility to document and witness the testing
We have already received generous equipment donations
for the Crash Test from such companies as Q’straint which is the world leader
in Wheelchair Restraints, Intellectual data donated by SEA industries, and
others donations.
What we hope to achieve with this project is proof
of concept that wheelchairs can withstand the FAA Crash Test of 16 G – just as
they have already passed for crash tests in vehicles.  
We will give data to the FAA, Congress, Airlines,
Airplane Manufacturers, Universities specializing in Aviation Testing, and
organizations specializing in Wheelchair Safety.  
We hope the FAA and Congress will release funding
for more in depth research with organizations such as the FAA and
Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America
(RESNA), The National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research
(NIDRR), and the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Wheelchair
Transportation Safety (RERC WTS). 
We also hope to work directly with Airplane
Manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing and Airplane Interior Manufacturers
such as B/E Aerospace.
We hope this campaign will get us to our goal and
help us get one step closer to people who use Wheelchairs being able to fly on Airplanes from the safety of their chairs. We
are a 501c3 Nonprofit so all donations are Tax Deductible.
Long
Term Goal
Individuals who use Wheelchairs can ride Trains, Boats, Subways, Buses, Cars, and
even Ride Sharing from the safety of their chairs right now, but not Airplanes.
Right now, flying with a Wheelchair is a nightmare
especially if someone has a neuromuscular disease severely diminishing their strength. They have to get out of their wheelchair, which literally is their legs,
at the gate and transfer into an aisle chair to get on to the plane before
transferring one more time into the airplane seat. They have to sit for the
entire flight without the medically necessary back supports, cushion, safety
restraints, foot plates, breathing equipment, or feeding equipment their wheelchair might have. Some of them even have to be held upright during takeoff
and landings if they do not have the strength.
When they finally arrive at the destination, they have
to worry about if their wheelchair gets damaged and, more often than not, it
does get damaged even if they have done everything to protect it such as taking
off the headrest and joystick at the gate. We have heard from people of their
wheelchairs getting completely broken and even sent to the wrong airport if you
can believe it. This hurts the airlines as well because they have to pay
millions in repairs every year.
We have many images of flying with a
wheelchair on our Image Gallery and Facebook and Twitter pages.

Ironically the other parts of flying for someone who uses a
Wheelchair are not a problem and there are advancements like Accessible Bathrooms rapidly approaching. You can also rent Accessible Vans and get
Accessible Hotel Rooms all around the world. 
How
Else You Can Help


Please follow us on Facebook and Twitter. We will be
doing much more in the future such as reaching out to Congress, FAA, Airplane
Manufacturers, and the Airlines and we will need YOUR help.


Tell your friends and families about our campaign, organization,
and what we are fighting for.


We hope to make the dream of flying from the safety
of Wheelchairs into a reality for all individuals who use them and their
families. There are so many amazing places around the world and a wheelchair
should not stop you from traveling to them.",1.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Several years ago I traveled to Kenya to volunteer with LPM.

<p>Although I cannot afford a visit anytime soon, I'd love to raise some funds to help with the building of a school (equipped with 2 dormitories) for HIV Positive families in Mlolongo, Kenya. They need approximately $21000 USD to make this happen. </p>
<p>I've committed to walk 41K in one recorded day to show my support for this cause. This walk will occur Sunday, August 9. Myself and some other teams have committed to doing a local race that includes mental and physical challenges in Sydney, Australia that will occur Sunday, August 23rd. Since we've committed, we felt this was a great opportunity to raise money for a cause that is close to our hearts: HIV Positive women and families who need support for self-sustainability.

<div>Fusion Theatre Company are conservatoire-trained, professional, theatre practitioners, based in London. We have made it our mission to create <b>professionally constructed shows that enhance educational standards via drama-based learning</b> and our creative team has a cumulative 65 years in theatre and education.</div>
<h3>Our Aim</h3>
<div>Our mission is to fuse links between people and cultures, languages, heritage and society, using theatre as a vehicle to educate, entertain and enhance our understanding of the world.</div>
<div>How can we teach young people about what it means to be British?</div>
<div>How should they learn about what it is that unites us a country?<br/>
</div>
<div>We all know there have been huge cuts in both arts and education, yet still it is vital to have opportunities to experience the arts within education, especially at primary school level.</div>
<div>
<p>With our project we aim to <b>deliver professional shows, workshops and education packs
to primary school pupils in Key Stage 1 and 2</b> to promote British Values, now an ofsted requirement, using drama as a tool to develop key skills. </p>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3>How do we do this?</h3>
<div>Through the magic of theatre! We are going to create our groundbreaking devised performance of <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">‘Stories from Around the World’ with accompanying educational workshops.</span>
</div>
<div>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><span>‘Stories from Around the World’ is our visually stunning, interactive, professionally constructed, immersive, storytelling extravaganza! Captain Cook will lead the pupils on a voyage around the continents on his magical ship, HMS Endeavour! Throughout the exploration, fairytales, myths and legends from all over the world will be discovered, investigating each country’s customs, performance styles, music and languages, with some exciting and hilarious characters on the way!</span></span></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><span>To make it as informative as possible, we cover elements of the new National Curriculum 2015 in Geography, English, History, Citizenship, and SMSC. Most importantly, we celebrate different faiths and beliefs in order to promote British Values.<br/></span></span></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><span></span></span></p>
<p>The children will have the opportunity to engage with the show, advance the plot and help the main characters decide whether their decisions are right or wrong. Along with this, they will be introduced to different cultures and customs from different countries around the world, how they speak, what instruments they have and what performance they do.</p>
<p>The children will watch and engage with the show, explore the subjects within the workshops and be encouraged to develop self-knowledge, self-esteem and self-confidence. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><span>What makes us unique?</span></span></h3>

<p>What else?</p></span></span></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We offer an experience you will never forget by transforming any venue into a theatrical landscape worthy of the west end. This means that each performance has a different set up; therefore no two are the same. Our aim is to transform any space into a unique and magical environment.</span>
</li>
<li>All our practitioners are current industry professionals.</li>
<li>We are one of the few companies who are assisting with the promotion of British Values using theatre as a medium to communicate.</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our show incorporates costumes, puppets, masks, props and instruments from all over the world, so that children can see examples drawn from each of the cultures we will explore.</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We incorporate varied traditional performance techniques from each story's country of origin. For example, Rangda vs. the Barong, our story from Bali, is a Topeng Masked Dance.</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The interactive performance style allows the children to advance the plot.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>A Sneak Peak</h3>
</div>
<div>Our designer Max has been planning, drawing and colouring none stop to give us an idea of some of the characters, costumes, puppets, masks and set we will be creating. </div>

<div><ul>
<li>Offer 4 actors a working contract of 4 months. </li>
<li>The Actors are on call with a weeks notice.</li>

<div>2. As part of Stories from Around the World we will be working in depth with instruments, costumes and traditions from other countries and we are dedicated to representing them with the utmost respect and skill, as they would be performed in the native country.</div>
<div>This will involved making opportunities for our pool of actors with experts to provide the relevant knowledge and experience. </div>

</div></div>","About Us
Fusion Theatre Company are conservatoire-trained, professional, theatre practitioners, based in London. We have made it our mission to create professionally constructed shows that enhance educational standards via drama-based learning and our creative team has a cumulative 65 years in theatre and education.
Our Aim
Our mission is to fuse links between people and cultures, languages, heritage and society, using theatre as a vehicle to educate, entertain and enhance our understanding of the world.
How can we teach young people about what it means to be British?
How should they learn about what it is that unites us a country?

We all know there have been huge cuts in both arts and education, yet still it is vital to have opportunities to experience the arts within education, especially at primary school level.

With our project we aim to deliver professional shows, workshops and education packs
to primary school pupils in Key Stage 1 and 2 to promote British Values, now an ofsted requirement, using drama as a tool to develop key skills. 


How do we do this?
Through the magic of theatre! We are going to create our groundbreaking devised performance of ‘Stories from Around the World’ with accompanying educational workshops.


‘Stories from Around the World’ is our visually stunning, interactive, professionally constructed, immersive, storytelling extravaganza! Captain Cook will lead the pupils on a voyage around the continents on his magical ship, HMS Endeavour! Throughout the exploration, fairytales, myths and legends from all over the world will be discovered, investigating each country’s customs, performance styles, music and languages, with some exciting and hilarious characters on the way!
To make it as informative as possible, we cover elements of the new National Curriculum 2015 in Geography, English, History, Citizenship, and SMSC. Most importantly, we celebrate different faiths and beliefs in order to promote British Values.

The children will have the opportunity to engage with the show, advance the plot and help the main characters decide whether their decisions are right or wrong. Along with this, they will be introduced to different cultures and customs from different countries around the world, how they speak, what instruments they have and what performance they do.
The children will watch and engage with the show, explore the subjects within the workshops and be encouraged to develop self-knowledge, self-esteem and self-confidence. 


What makes us unique?
Our Gender Wayang! A Balinese instrument custom made for us by a wonderful artist in Bali, specifically designed to accompany shadow puppetry, shhhh don't tell anyone yet!

What else?



We offer an experience you will never forget by transforming any venue into a theatrical landscape worthy of the west end. This means that each performance has a different set up; therefore no two are the same. Our aim is to transform any space into a unique and magical environment.

All our practitioners are current industry professionals.
We are one of the few companies who are assisting with the promotion of British Values using theatre as a medium to communicate.
Our show incorporates costumes, puppets, masks, props and instruments from all over the world, so that children can see examples drawn from each of the cultures we will explore.
We incorporate varied traditional performance techniques from each story's country of origin. For example, Rangda vs. the Barong, our story from Bali, is a Topeng Masked Dance.
The interactive performance style allows the children to advance the plot.

A Sneak Peak

Our designer Max has been planning, drawing and colouring none stop to give us an idea of some of the characters, costumes, puppets, masks and set we will be creating. 
All of the designs pull inspiration from the cultures the stories originate from along with our own sprinkle of Fusion style.











What We Need 
Contributing to our campaign would allow us to deliver our professional show, development workshops and education packs, to as many primary schools across North London as possible for £6 per student! 
This includes Islington, Haringey, Hackney, Barnet, Enfield and Camden. 
   
Our campaign total is £35,000! 

We would like to deliver the show to as many children as possible, across as many schools as possible.
There are 403 primary schools in North London alone!
Depending on the amount of funding we receive, we would split it up in the following ways:
£1,000 - £100 discount to 10 schools reaching 900 pupils.
£5,000 - £100 discount to 50 schools reaching 4500 pupils.
£10,000 - £100 discount to 100 schools reaching 9000 pupils.
£20,000 - £100 discount to 200 schools reaching 18000 pupils.
£30,000 - £100 discount to 300 schools reaching 27000 pupils.
The rest of the money is broken up between:


Props.
Costumes. 
Masks.
Puppets.
Instruments from around the world - Shamisen, Sitar, Balalaika and Bouzouki.
Fully functional professional set.
Professional sound and lighting board.
Wages for creative team - Actors, Director, Designers.
Advertising.
Printing and Postage.
CRM System.
Office Costs.

We realise this is nowhere near the amount of primary schools across North London. The total number of primary schools is 403! But depending on the success of our campaign we would like to expand our reach to as many of these as possible.
 Perks

When you contribute to Fusion Theatre Company you will become part of the theatre in education revolution! And as a reward you can also select some perks that will help you tell others about what we are doing so they can join us too. 
Our feature perk at the £1000 receives a special performance of our show for a number of audience members at a venue to suit the donor's needs. This can be ANYWHERE! A town hall, a garden, wherever you would like to see it!
   The Impact 

We believe it is important to have access to theatre at all stages of life, as we feel the arts are such a crucial part of education allowing us to unlock profound human understanding, therefore we offer our shows not only in professional theatres but also within a school setting. 

Learning Outcomes:

Enable students to develop their self- knowledge, self- esteem and self- confidence.
Encourage respect for other peoples.
Further tolerance and harmony between different cultural traditions by enabling students to acquire an appreciation and respect for their own and other cultures.
Promotes the spiritual, moral, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society.
Encourage respect for democracy and support for participation in democratic processes.
Enable students to distinguish right from wrong and to respect the civil and criminal law.


We believe we need to educate children to appreciate the vast cultural contribution that our nation has made to the arts and indeed the world and to broaden young people’s horizons through the cultural heritage of other nations.
Our aim is to create the opportunity for everybody who attends our shows to participate in the performance, and workshops using a visual, auditory, and kinesthetic approach to learning and encouraging them to discover how theatre and the arts can enrich their lives.

    Challenges
1. One of our greatest challenges is organising the logistics of a pool of actors to deliver the work in to schools.
Our main concerns:


Rehearsing multiple actors.
Giving permanent work.
Not offering flexibility in the first few months.
Expense of rehearsing more than one set of actors.

Solution


Offer 4 actors a working contract of 4 months. 
The Actors are on call with a weeks notice.
There has to be an amount of flexibility on both sides.
When the period is close to expiry, 4 more actors will be trained to add to the pool giving flexibility to both sides.
Repeat as growth demands.

2. As part of Stories from Around the World we will be working in depth with instruments, costumes and traditions from other countries and we are dedicated to representing them with the utmost respect and skill, as they would be performed in the native country.
This will involved making opportunities for our pool of actors with experts to provide the relevant knowledge and experience. 
This will be a two-pronged approach with the creative team at Fusion and multiple international contacts to deliver work that is true to form.

program at Our Lady of the Lake University (OLLU) was started in 2007. Since
that time, the team has grown from a small start up to a legitimate contender
for the Red River Athletic Conference championship. This year, OLLU hosts the

their first ever conference championship.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Since the
program was started, very little equipment and training aids have been bought for
the team. The women have been practicing in a manner where they only receive 60
percent of the reps and touches. To be
able to use 100 percent of the time allotted, OLLU is requesting:</p>
<p>- 4 boxes to
use for hitting and serving drills. These boxes allow extra swings without
wearing down the players and it allows defenders a more game-like situation
when working on digging the ball.</p>
<p>- 2 setter
targets so setters can set consistently instead of being targets for each
other.</p>
<p>- 2 passing
targets so that passers can have something to aim for and the players can spend
less time shagging and more time passing</p>
<p>Also, OLLU’s
budget only covers the fall season. During the spring, OLLU would like to play
in a couple of tournaments against NCAA Division 1 and 2 schools
where the Saints can compete against the best teams in Texas. To do this, OLLU
will need to cover:</p>
<p>- Rental
vans for one out of town tournament</p>
<p>- Food and
lodging for one out of town tournament and one tournament in San Antonio (food
only)</p>
<p>Finally, OLLU
wants to provide its student-athletes with the best experience possible at this
amazing institution. To do this, OLLU provides the women with apparel, workout
equipment and other various items which they wear to represent OLLU. In this
regard, OLLU is asking for:</p>
<p>-
Contributions to cover athletes’ meals when they report to campus before school
opens</p>
<p>- Help
defray the cost of uniforms and shoes.</p>
<p></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>The women on
this team work extremely hard to represent themselves and OLLU. Helping them
with new volleyball training tools allows them to not only succeed on the court
but also in the classroom. Less time wasted in practice shagging and standing
means better and shorter practices which allows more time for studying. OLLU’s
goal this year is to be an AVCA Academic All-American team and OLLU fans can help
them with this goal!</p>
<p>The Saints
Volleyball Team wants to represent Our lady of the Lake University not just on
a local level, but on a national level. With your donations, OLLU has a better
chance of doing this at the national championships in Sioux City, Iowa!</p>

<p>In addition
to giving, or if you do not have any extra cash, please support the Saints by

The SBS model rests on the three core components:</p>

a holistic approach to preparing women as business leaders.
This training includes breaking down traditional stereotypes,
building confidence, providing basic education, offering
simplified and practical training on market research, business
plan development, procuring capital and bookkeeping. BeadforLife offers
informal internships and one-on-one coaching, at which point participants
discuss individual business plans and goals. If a participant has

<p><b>About BeadforLife </b></p>
<p>Ten years ago, three sassy women founded BeadforLife after a
chance encounter opened their hearts and sparked their imagination. Torkin
Wakefield, Ginny Jordan, and Devin Hibbard met Millie Grace Akena while walking
through a crowded Ugandan slum.  Millie was sitting on the ground outside
of her mud home, rolling small strips of paper into colorful beads in the
sweltering sun. She caught their eye, and they stopped to learn more about this
intriguing woman.</p>
<p>They soon learned that Millie was originally from Northern
Uganda and had been driven from her home by Joseph Kony and the Lord’s
Resistance Army. She fled to Kampala to protect her children from being
kidnapped to become soldiers. To support her family, she and her five children
worked in a rock quarry crushing stones into pebbles with a hand mallet. The
family earned less than a dollar a day for their efforts. Our founders were
taken aback by her story.  How could such hardship and struggle exist in a
world where some enjoy so much material wealth?</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441066757/mx3tyz5hcqq9ykgttxfo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Founder, Torkin
Wakefield and Millie Grace Akena</i></p>
<p>While Millie’s story was heartbreaking, she held onto hope,
determined to create a better future for her children. She found joy in
transforming recycled paper into striking paper bead necklaces. The
problem?  No one had the money to buy it.</p>
<p>Torkin, Ginny, and Devin bought a few necklaces and immediately
attracted the attention of other would-be bead-wearers in Uganda. The months
that followed changed the lives of everyone involved. Beads were brought back
to The United States and women began opening their hearts and their homes to
Ugandan women half a world away.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441067493/y6xjuow0jtl023z4e8b3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>A Beads to Business graduate wearing and carrying her beads</i></p><p>Beads were only the beginning. We could have stayed the course,
working with one group of women to create a product that we could sell for them
in the U.S. market – but we had bigger dreams. We created an 18 month
entrepreneurial business training, giving Ugandan women living in extreme
poverty the skills and confidence they need to go out and create their own
local businesses before they graduate.  Salons, shoe stores, and produce
stands are cropping up in Uganda and women are making money and living out
their dreams.  Not only do they have the income, but now they have the
confidence to be sustainable businesswomen - meeting their own needs and
creating a generation of confident and capable children.</p>
<p>We didn’t stop there. We’ve taken the best parts of that

<h2><span>Why Music?</span></h2>
<h4>""Where words fail, music speaks."" -- Hans Christian Andersen </h4>
<p>Our children need music!  Research shows that music stimulates brain development, improves language skills, and inspires creative thinking. Music promotes self-discipline, social understanding, and builds bridges between communities. The lack of access to music education in today’s schools further deprives the underserved children who can benefit from it the most!  </p>
<p>Our most touching, celebratory, and learning experiences are often tied to music. Please help us give the gift of music to our children! </p>

I have followed the life of refugees in <br/>Gaza and documented political decisions, in trying to save a piece of history <br/>and to show the truth through my pictures.<br/><br/>All those years I worked for a German Press Agency as a stock photographer <br/>giving all my power into this work.<br/>Almost one year ago I was invited from the agency in Germany which offered <br/>me new possibilities to take a step further in my career. I came from Gaza <br/>with the hope of reaching the world and making my camera a medium of <br/>expression and communication.<br/><br/>Unfortunately my agency did not support me with my career here, but wanted <br/>me to go back to work in Gaza instead. As I would face severe difficulties in <br/>Gaza for having left the country, my way to Germany proved to be a one way <br/>road. But as returning to Gaza is not a possibility for me, the  agency  <br/>cancelled the contract.<br/><br/>As a consequence I had to give back all my equipment to the agency (2x <br/>cameras, 2x lenses and my laptop with all the programmes for my work).<br/>I was extremely surprised and disappointed with this development. <br/><br/><br/><br/><b>My Project:</b><br/><br/>Since I arrived in Germany I worked in the only job I know to do good which is <br/>photography. I have started a project 6 months ago, where I follow refugees <br/>here in Germany and around Europe.<br/><br/>My project focuses on the life of the refugees and on the mutual influence of their new environment on them and on the influence they have on their new environment. <br/>I am aiming to point out the mutual awareness and acceptance <br/>between the European people and the refugees as a result of their <br/>coexistence.<br/><br/>I aim to capture the truth as I believe that factual communication will erase <br/>the fear for the unknown and build bridges between the European people and <br/>the refugees. <div>

My pictures have been published in prestigious newspapers such as the New York Times, Time, The Guardian, The Los Angeles Times, Newsweek, The Independent, El País, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Rundschau, De Volkskrant, Libération and I won several awards for my work.Further information on my work can be found here:http://www.worldpressphoto.org/people/ali-ali http://www.epa.eu/about-epa/awards/frontline-club-awards-2013-photojournalismhttp://www.frontlineclub.com/frontline-club-awards-ceremony-2013/http://time.com/3803758/discovering-the-next-generation-of-photojournalists-at-world-press-photos-masterclass/http://time.com/3801405/wire-photographer-spotlight-conflict-and-conscience-in-gaza-by-ali-ali/Since the age of 17 I have been holding a camera in my hand and put myself in situations of war and of pain and suffering, but also captured the happy moments, showing a smile or laughter. I have followed the life of refugees in Gaza and documented political decisions, in trying to save a piece of history and to show the truth through my pictures.All those years I worked for a German Press Agency as a stock photographer giving all my power into this work.Almost one year ago I was invited from the agency in Germany which offered me new possibilities to take a step further in my career. I came from Gaza with the hope of reaching the world and making my camera a medium of expression and communication.Unfortunately my agency did not support me with my career here, but wanted me to go back to work in Gaza instead. As I would face severe difficulties in Gaza for having left the country, my way to Germany proved to be a one way road. But as returning to Gaza is not a possibility for me, the  agency  cancelled the contract.As a consequence I had to give back all my equipment to the agency (2x cameras, 2x lenses and my laptop with all the programmes for my work).I was extremely surprised and disappointed with this development. My Project:Since I arrived in Germany I worked in the only job I know to do good which is photography. I have started a project 6 months ago, where I follow refugees here in Germany and around Europe.My project focuses on the life of the refugees and on the mutual influence of their new environment on them and on the influence they have on their new environment. I am aiming to point out the mutual awareness and acceptance between the European people and the refugees as a result of their coexistence.I aim to capture the truth as I believe that factual communication will erase the fear for the unknown and build bridges between the European people and the refugees. 
I wish to support a successful integration by using photography as an instrument of love and revelation. To achieve this, I have to find my own stories beside the mainstream and to work independently of any agency.What I need to continue my project:Equipment:In order to be able to continue my project it is the most essential for me to buy again the equipment.- 2 x body 5D canon : 5,200 Euro = $5,580https://www.calumetphoto.de/product/Canon-EOS-5D-Mark-III-Gehause/CANEOS5DMIII?gclid=CjwKEAiAk7O0BRD9_Ka2w_PhwSkSJAAmKswx2z4pBQj1nRFPHh4Qk0nybZDWSUxu5Qk0v01MLHe72hoCCNPw_wcB- 70-200 canon lens 2.8: 2,000 Euro = $2,150http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/680103-USA/Canon_2751B002_EF_70_200mm_f_2_8L_IS.html- 16-35 canon lens: 1,200 Euro = $2,150http://www.amazon.de/Canon-EF-16-35mm-Objektiv-Filtergewinde/dp/B000NSHPG6Travels:My approach is to be part of the personal life of each refugee that I am taking pictures of  to be able to bring out what is in his/her soul. In order to do so I have to follow each person I take a picture of for a period of time.The countries I will shoot in:· Germany· France· Belgium· Greece· Serbia· HungaryFor each country I will need at least one month, depending on the accessibility and cooperation from the different authorities.Thus, for each country I will need approx. 1,000-1,500 Euro including: accommodation/ travel costs to the country/ travel costs in the country/ translator (when needed)/ food
Total travel costs: 9,000 Euro = $9,674Total equipment: 8,400 Euro = $9,029Total Amount: 17,400 Euro = $18,700

*note: my campaign's original goal is in Euro currency but I changed it to Dollar so I can use the bank account tool to receive funds along with the Paypal tool.To make my project happen, I sincerely need your help. Please support my work by contributing and\or sharing the campaign!Thank you all!Ali Ali",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>On September 26, 2015 I will be running from

to raise awareness of the importance of youth leadership.  I have created
a Youth Leadership Development Program (YLDP) that includes a basketball league
and a leadership development program.  The program emphasis on personal
leadership development in an interpersonal setting.</p>
<p>The need for developing youth to be effective
leaders is paramount in securing a better future for the country, starting with
each person doing their part.  When youth are given skills to lead
effectively their opportunities to be change makers that help economies
increase.</p>
<p>The YLDP is a multi-layered program.  It
connects youth to professionals in various fields to provide them with
excellent references for employment and other future endeavours.  The
program consists of participants from different communities throughout the GTA
to bridge gaps and focus on common challenges faced by differences.  Jobs
will be created and growth in the mental, physical and social aspects are all
addressed.</p>
<p>By contributing to this initiative you will have
helped youth who do not have adequate resources to fund, find or participate in
sports leagues and leadership programs.  By supporting this initiative you
will have helped youth expand their network and open the opportunity for them
to be mentored by professional Athletes, Police Officers, the EMS and the Fire
Department.  You will also be providing an avenue for continuous support

for 29 years.   When we started we had no one to actually teach us
with ""hands on"" so we read a lot of books and tried ideas by success
and failure method.  We stayed at it, we learned how to preserve our
produce from the garden the same way.  We would of loved to have someone
show us with a ""hands on method"".  </p>
<p>  Over
the years we were able to feed our 5 children from our garden all year
long.  If we had not started gardening, canning and freezing our food I
don't know how we would of made it trying to keep 5 mouths feed, (4 were
boys).  Over the last 7 years I have had the opportunity to work with a
program called ""Eating from the Garden"".  With this program I go
into the schools, community centers, homeless shelters and after school
programs and teach how to cook from their gardens that they have planted
at the facility.  I love to teach people how to cook, can and
preserve their food that they worked so hard for in their garden.  I love
to show people how they can provide for their family from their own back yards.
 How they can provide nutritious meals at the fraction of the price. 
Without chemicals, preservatives, high fructose sugar, msg, etc. in their food
so their kids will be stronger and not have so many physical problems.</p>
<p>  With this
campaign you will be helping to build a certified kitchen where we will be
teaching classes on canning, freezing and cooking.  We will be also
teaching classes on gardening in small spaces.  We have removed the
failures by learning from our mistakes and giving them the opportunity to
succeed to improve their daily living.<strong> ""Building one person, one family , one community at a time!""</strong></p>
<p>  Our
campaign is to build a certified kitchen in a 2nd house we have on our
property.  We will need to put up washable walls in the kitchen area and
remove one wall to make a larger kitchen  for our classes to be
held.  We will be upgrading the electrical and plumbing so it will be able
to handle the larger volume of appliances and sinks.  We will be putting
in a walk-in cooler and buying a commercial freezer, stove, sinks and dish
washer.  By helping our campaign you will be helping families of all
economic situations (especially low income families) to help make their food
budget decrease by learning to grow their food in small spaces, how to put
their food up for future days with canning, freezing, dehydration and other
methods.  This will increase the healthy foods and lower the food
budget that they can serve their families.<span> 
We believe that in today's economic stress families are needing a place
to learn, with a hands on method of cooking, canning, freezing, dehydrating and
freeze drying the food that they have grown  to help their families make
ends meet.</span></p>
<p><b>By
helping support our campaign you will be helping to invest in lives of families
in the Independence/Kansas City area.  You will be helping low income
families be able to take pride in providing for their families by suppling
healthy low cost food to their children and their selves.  </b></p>
<p>  Our goal on
this campaign is to raise $20,000.  This will help to build a certified
kitchen for the families to come in and put their abundant tomato crop
up.  They will not have to invest in the canning supplies to be able to
save $ by processing their spaghetti sauce that they worked so hard in
growing.  They will be able to pressure cook their green beans to preserve
them for the winter months.  They will be able to dehydrate their fresh
basil &amp; oregano to be able to cook with throughout the 4 seasons. 
These families will be able to freeze their strawberries with a process that
will keep the air out of the bags to keep their product as fresh as possible
without freezer burn. They will learn to make beef stew or chicken soup and how to preserve it through canning
 for a fast easy meal .  They will have the
opportunity to come in and do once a month cooking to help them save time and
money for their families.</p>
<p>  We are
trying to get a grant (15,000.) with the SARE program that will help build the
kitchen also.  This grant will fund 50% of the cost to build a certified
kitchen with all the tools that a family could use to lower their food
budget.  We are partnering with several low income identities to help
reach families such as Ivanhoe Community Center and Farmers Market, Raytown Farmers
Market, Swope Memorial, Community Service Leagues of Jackson County, CAPA,
Salvation Army, Hawthorn Community Center, Cultivate KC and University of MO as
well as some local churches.  With these partners helping us reach the low
income and helping teach gardening, cooking, canning, freezing and dehydration classes
we will be able to see a change in the families overall health and financial
situations by taking the load off of the head of the household, by helping
lower the monthly food budget, physical exercise in the garden and by healthier
eating.  </p>
<p>With supporting this campaign you
will also be awarded some of the jellies and jams, relishes, apple butter etc.
that we can for our customers at farmers markets, bakery and local
store.  You will have the opportunity to try some of the products that
they will be learning to make in the certified kitchen.  You will be able
to taste the freshness, see the ingredients no preservatives, no high fructose
corn syrup, no msg,  in the food they will be learning to grow, can and
preserve. </p>
<p>If by chance we don't reach our goal
we have choose the option to use whatever we can raise to reach the goal. 
In other words if we only raise 1/2 of our goal we will start work on the
kitchen with what we have and keep plugging away at our goal.  (Pressing
toward the mark that God has called us to). With all of us helping with a
little or a lot we will eventually be able to help the low income families in
the Kansas City area help support their families with pride without a hands out
but a hands up!</p>
<p><b>The
Impact our campaign will have on our community……</b></p>
<p>By helping us raise funds to build a
certified kitchen ( to t<span>each low income families
how to garden, cook, and put their food up for future months or to sell at markets
to raise their income level) you will be helping the entire community.  You will be helping them improve their lives
and the lives of their children with better food choices, physical activity,
and learning a skill that they will be able to use the rest of their lives.  They will be learning how to grow food using the techniques that are best siuted to their life's circumstances, whether it is in
an apartment, small house with not much yard or a decent size yard.  They will be able to learn container
gardening, vertical, square foot, no lawn,
lasagna, hay bale gardening and more.  It
doesn’t matter where they live <strong>they can garden!</strong> They will be able to take the next step of
gardening, ""What do I do with all this produce now!"" They will learn how to can,
freeze, dehydrate and freeze dry it.  Or
maybe they choose to sell part of it to a local store or farmers market; they
will learn what they need to do to be an entrepreneur. They will be shown what
markets they can sell in and have a certified kitchen to work out of at a reasonable
price. </span></p>
<p><b>There
are Risks &amp; Challenges to this campaign just like anything we do in life….</b></p>
<p>There are always risk and challenges
to anything that we do in life and this campaign is not any different.<span>  Some of the risks are …..  Will bugs over take my crop. Will it be too rainy
or to dry?  Will we be able to get
families to care enough to want to make a difference in their lives and their
families lives?, will I be able to get enough funds to get a kitchen built?  Will I be able to manage my project and make
it successful?  Let us address each one
of these risk and concerns.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Yes bugs, rain and drought will put a damper
on  garden plans but that is part of our growing process.<span>  How do we overcome the obstacle and teach that
to others?  For instance this year was a
very strange year for growing in the Kansas City area.  We had a beautiful early spring.  We had a lot out in our garden in March and
April and we were selling produce at market by the first of May, then the rains
hit.  It rained and rained and rained!  We had flooding in the garden and had
to go out and work on another area to control the water flow.  It rained so much that we got very little
planted in May and June.  We did pick our
first tomatoes to eat by the last week in May and was able to start selling
some by June 15 but we still didn’t have much in the ground.  We just extended our garden area by 6 ft. X30 ft.  We were able to get the beds made the seeds and plants in the ground and finished up that night
at 9:00.  We went back out the next morning and finished the last of the
plantings when it started raining again. 
It pored buckets and buckets of water down from the sky and we also got
all of the down pour from the neighborhood. 
There were rivers of rapids and waterfalls crashing down in the empty
lot next to our house and it went like a mighty river toward our garden.  When it was over there was a little bit that
had washed out from the spring planting  but… the new part of the garden was totally
washed out.  There was a big pile of mud
and plants at the bottom of the garden. 
It was discouraging knowing all the work we had just done was lost.  We didn’t give up,,, we started to dig a L shaped
trench around the new area it was 12 x 40 ft long, and 9 in. deep, 3 in wide.  We did this all by hand while it was still
lightly raining.  When the heavy rain hit
again later that day it caught and controlled the flow around the garden and
held.  Success!!  Now to plant again when it was dry
enough.  I first went through the mud
pile at the bottom of the garden and managed to save about 20 plants and put
them back into pots to wait for the day to replant.  That day did finally come even though we did
not get all the seeds back in the ground we did get the plants in and they are
still producing and it is now November 9, 2015. 
We still have huckleberry, eggplant, peppers and tomatillos growing
strong from that flood.  We had others
problem throughout the garden because of the very wet growing season but
overall we succeed in a tough situation and overcame many obstacles with much
hard work and endurance to see it through.</span></p></li>
<li><p>Yes I believe we will be able to get
families to come out and take advantage of the classes, techniques and kitchen
that we will have for them to utilize by working closely with the community
centers, community service league, salvation army and churches.<span>  We will need to help access their housing
situation, teach them the best way of gardening for their circumstances, teach them
some gardening skills and then help them walk through the steps of saving their
produce that will be the best for their situation.  If they don’t have freezer room they might
need to can or dehydrate everything. 
Maybe they don’t need so many green peppers and eggplants, how can they
sell these to bring in a little $ to buy some meat for their family.  We will be there to help them take the next
step, just like our motto stays <strong>“Building one person, one family, one community
at a time”</strong></span></p></li>
<li><p>What if we don’t raise enough funds
to build the kitchen?<span>  We do what we have
always done, we work with what we have…. 
We teach the gardening classes and teach individual classes whenever we
need to in their home or in mine.  Not the
perfect situations but it will work.  We
build the kitchen a piece at a time until the whole puzzle fits together.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>Will we be able to manage our projects
and make it successful?<span>  Yes I believe we can we have been working toward this goal for 30 years.  Learning one piece of the puzzle at a time,
learning the ends and outs of it.  Now is
the time to put all the pieces together and see the beautiful picture that it
makes.  A picture that will help low
income families learn to grow, cook and preserve the food they need and want to
have a healthy productive life.  One where
they will be learning new skills, nutrition and exercise to improve their daily
lives.  Where they will have the choice to
eat healthy at a fraction of the cost and a fraction of the daily cooking
time.  </span></p>
<p><span>  HOW CAN YOU HELP?</span></p>
<p><span>  Will you help us put this puzzle together
to <strong>“build one person, one family, one community at a time”</strong>?  If you cannot help financially there are
still other ways to help work on this puzzle together….</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>Please tell others about our project campaign
by word of mouth, Facebook, twitter, emails, etc.<span>  The more you share the louder our campaign
will be heard!!  We need everyone to be
talking about how they can help the low income in the Kansas City/Independence
area to move up the ladder to self-reliance in gardening, canning and bring in
income from their produce.</span></p></li>
<li><p>We will also be needing individuals
that have the same passion that we do for the low income to help at the farm
with gardening, canning, cooking, etc. classes.<span> 
Contact us and let us help you be part of the puzzle to build this
campaign together.  Never know, you might
be the one puzzle piece that we are missing!!!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>Other ways you can help..<span>  do you have a rain barrel not being used,
garden tools, forms that we can use for vertical gardens, pots, etc.  Let us know so we can use these to help the
low income build what they are needing to improve their daily lives.</span></p>

situations by taking the load off of the head of the household, by helping
lower the monthly food budget, physical exercise in the garden and by healthier
eating.  
With supporting this campaign you
will also be awarded some of the jellies and jams, relishes, apple butter etc.
that we can for our customers at farmers markets, bakery and local
store.  You will have the opportunity to try some of the products that
they will be learning to make in the certified kitchen.  You will be able
to taste the freshness, see the ingredients no preservatives, no high fructose
corn syrup, no msg,  in the food they will be learning to grow, can and
preserve. 
If by chance we don't reach our goal
we have choose the option to use whatever we can raise to reach the goal. 
In other words if we only raise 1/2 of our goal we will start work on the
kitchen with what we have and keep plugging away at our goal.  (Pressing
toward the mark that God has called us to). With all of us helping with a
little or a lot we will eventually be able to help the low income families in
the Kansas City area help support their families with pride without a hands out
but a hands up!
The
Impact our campaign will have on our community……
By helping us raise funds to build a
certified kitchen ( to teach low income families
how to garden, cook, and put their food up for future months or to sell at markets
to raise their income level) you will be helping the entire community.  You will be helping them improve their lives
and the lives of their children with better food choices, physical activity,
and learning a skill that they will be able to use the rest of their lives.  They will be learning how to grow food using the techniques that are best siuted to their life's circumstances, whether it is in
an apartment, small house with not much yard or a decent size yard.  They will be able to learn container
gardening, vertical, square foot, no lawn,
lasagna, hay bale gardening and more.  It
doesn’t matter where they live they can garden! They will be able to take the next step of
gardening, ""What do I do with all this produce now!"" They will learn how to can,
freeze, dehydrate and freeze dry it.  Or
maybe they choose to sell part of it to a local store or farmers market; they
will learn what they need to do to be an entrepreneur. They will be shown what
markets they can sell in and have a certified kitchen to work out of at a reasonable
price. 
There
are Risks & Challenges to this campaign just like anything we do in life….
There are always risk and challenges
to anything that we do in life and this campaign is not any different.  Some of the risks are …..  Will bugs over take my crop. Will it be too rainy
or to dry?  Will we be able to get
families to care enough to want to make a difference in their lives and their
families lives?, will I be able to get enough funds to get a kitchen built?  Will I be able to manage my project and make
it successful?  Let us address each one
of these risk and concerns.

Yes bugs, rain and drought will put a damper
on  garden plans but that is part of our growing process.  How do we overcome the obstacle and teach that
to others?  For instance this year was a
very strange year for growing in the Kansas City area.  We had a beautiful early spring.  We had a lot out in our garden in March and
April and we were selling produce at market by the first of May, then the rains
hit.  It rained and rained and rained!  We had flooding in the garden and had
to go out and work on another area to control the water flow.  It rained so much that we got very little
planted in May and June.  We did pick our
first tomatoes to eat by the last week in May and was able to start selling
some by June 15 but we still didn’t have much in the ground.  We just extended our garden area by 6 ft. X30 ft.  We were able to get the beds made the seeds and plants in the ground and finished up that night
at 9:00.  We went back out the next morning and finished the last of the
plantings when it started raining again. 
It pored buckets and buckets of water down from the sky and we also got
all of the down pour from the neighborhood. 
There were rivers of rapids and waterfalls crashing down in the empty
lot next to our house and it went like a mighty river toward our garden.  When it was over there was a little bit that
had washed out from the spring planting  but… the new part of the garden was totally
washed out.  There was a big pile of mud
and plants at the bottom of the garden. 
It was discouraging knowing all the work we had just done was lost.  We didn’t give up,,, we started to dig a L shaped
trench around the new area it was 12 x 40 ft long, and 9 in. deep, 3 in wide.  We did this all by hand while it was still
lightly raining.  When the heavy rain hit
again later that day it caught and controlled the flow around the garden and
held.  Success!!  Now to plant again when it was dry
enough.  I first went through the mud
pile at the bottom of the garden and managed to save about 20 plants and put
them back into pots to wait for the day to replant.  That day did finally come even though we did
not get all the seeds back in the ground we did get the plants in and they are
still producing and it is now November 9, 2015. 
We still have huckleberry, eggplant, peppers and tomatillos growing
strong from that flood.  We had others
problem throughout the garden because of the very wet growing season but
overall we succeed in a tough situation and overcame many obstacles with much
hard work and endurance to see it through.
Yes I believe we will be able to get
families to come out and take advantage of the classes, techniques and kitchen
that we will have for them to utilize by working closely with the community
centers, community service league, salvation army and churches.  We will need to help access their housing
situation, teach them the best way of gardening for their circumstances, teach them
some gardening skills and then help them walk through the steps of saving their
produce that will be the best for their situation.  If they don’t have freezer room they might
need to can or dehydrate everything. 
Maybe they don’t need so many green peppers and eggplants, how can they
sell these to bring in a little $ to buy some meat for their family.  We will be there to help them take the next
step, just like our motto stays “Building one person, one family, one community
at a time”
What if we don’t raise enough funds
to build the kitchen?  We do what we have
always done, we work with what we have…. 
We teach the gardening classes and teach individual classes whenever we
need to in their home or in mine.  Not the
perfect situations but it will work.  We
build the kitchen a piece at a time until the whole puzzle fits together.

Will we be able to manage our projects
and make it successful?  Yes I believe we can we have been working toward this goal for 30 years.  Learning one piece of the puzzle at a time,
learning the ends and outs of it.  Now is
the time to put all the pieces together and see the beautiful picture that it
makes.  A picture that will help low
income families learn to grow, cook and preserve the food they need and want to
have a healthy productive life.  One where
they will be learning new skills, nutrition and exercise to improve their daily
lives.  Where they will have the choice to
eat healthy at a fraction of the cost and a fraction of the daily cooking
time.  
  HOW CAN YOU HELP?
  Will you help us put this puzzle together
to “build one person, one family, one community at a time”?  If you cannot help financially there are
still other ways to help work on this puzzle together….



Please tell others about our project campaign
by word of mouth, Facebook, twitter, emails, etc.  The more you share the louder our campaign
will be heard!!  We need everyone to be
talking about how they can help the low income in the Kansas City/Independence
area to move up the ladder to self-reliance in gardening, canning and bring in
income from their produce.
We will also be needing individuals
that have the same passion that we do for the low income to help at the farm
with gardening, canning, cooking, etc. classes. 
Contact us and let us help you be part of the puzzle to build this
campaign together.  Never know, you might
be the one puzzle piece that we are missing!!!

Other ways you can help..  do you have a rain barrel not being used,
garden tools, forms that we can use for vertical gardens, pots, etc.  Let us know so we can use these to help the
low income build what they are needing to improve their daily lives.

Our district has been serving the Chimacum, Port Hadlock, Irondale, and Port Ludlow communities since 1948 and our children need the best we can offer to propel them into their futures in a 21st Century highly technological world. Families find it difficult to find jobs in this area so they either travel long distances to the city or live in poverty. Our students do not have access to technology at home so it is up to our schools to provide for our students.<br/></p>
<p>We have a plan to put the passion and control of learning into our students' hands while preparing them to compete and thrive in the 21st Century. Our district has facilities that are falling apart. It is for that reason that we are running bonds and capital levies whose focus are on upgrading and fixing our desperately needed buildings. While we understand the utmost importance of having buildings that are functional and comfortable for our students we also see the need to provide them with the tools needed to learn in those upgraded accommodations. <br/></p>
<p>Our middle school with approximately 250 students in grades 6 through 8 has proposed a plan where each student would get his and her own device to show them all how to use current technologies to connect, communicate, collaborate, and create using the critical thinking and problem solving skills needed to succeed. We are requesting the funds to put those devices in our kids' hands so that we may create a model that the rest of the district can follow.</p>
<p>Here's a shortened link to the plan we at the middle school came up with years ago that is still valid and is just waiting on some funding: <br/>goo.gl/nqdGPi<br/></p>
<p>Once the facilities are fixed and updated to serve our children in the next two years we can run a technology levy to implement the middle school one-to-one model in the rest of our schools. The funds requested in this campaign will jump start our plan to bring our children into the 21st Century and prepare them to be successful, contributing members of our great nation and our world!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What we need are enough Chromebook Flips, costing around $300 each, for each student and teacher in our middle school. With those 260 devices (250 students and 10 teachers) the middle school will design a one-to-one student-to-device plan that can be replicated by our primary, elementary, and high schools. Our plan will be available for any school looking to implement a one-to-one technology program their school.<br/></p>
<p>Middle school students will share all the incredible things they will be doing with their devices and share how having a Chromebook Flip will prepare them for a successful future.</p>
<p>Those who invest in our kids' futures will get personal videos and written thank you's showing all the ways students are taking control of their learning in school. We are expecting to see increased attendance and increased test scores as students see that learning in school can be fun, exciting and relevant to their era.</p>
<p>If we don't get enough money to start a full one-to-one for every student in the middle school there are two back up plans that we can implement. Plan A, is of course, to have one Chromebook Flip for every child in Chimacum Middle School. Plan B is to have one Chromebook Flip for every child in Chimacum Middle School's 6th grade, approximately 67 devices. And Plan C is to start an after school club for those students who are ready to use a Chromebook Flip in their classes, approximately 20 devices. Those students will serve as the tech support and experts when we do get enough money to equip every child!

<p>Since then, our MUN team has been preparing
for IMUN, a conference in Portugal enlisting 300 students from all over the
world discussing topics such as: the refugee crisis, the rights of the sex

the conference would bring this team, composed of Israelis, Palestinians and
internationals in an exciting, professional environment. </p>
<p>Currently, funding is the biggest obstacle
in the fulfilling of our dream, and this is where we need your help. The amount
specified would help us pay the flight tickets (approx. 400 $ per person),
participation fee (approx. 100$ per person), as well as accommodation for
around 4 days (approx. 100 $ per person). The amount we specified would allow
for sending of 6 of our teammates, yet with greater financial leeway, on behalf
of your generosity, we could send even more delegates to represent our cause. </p>
<p>One of the challenges we are facing at the
moment is the gathering of the funds in the short amount of time we have left
before the registration needs to be finalized, in order for us to start researching
and give our best in preparing for the conference. We believe that in today’s
world, there is a need to invest and youth to enable platforms for dialogue and
cooperation, as well as constructive exchange between countries. </p>

Currently, funding is the biggest obstacle
in the fulfilling of our dream, and this is where we need your help. The amount
specified would help us pay the flight tickets (approx. 400 $ per person),
participation fee (approx. 100$ per person), as well as accommodation for
around 4 days (approx. 100 $ per person). The amount we specified would allow
for sending of 6 of our teammates, yet with greater financial leeway, on behalf
of your generosity, we could send even more delegates to represent our cause. 
One of the challenges we are facing at the
moment is the gathering of the funds in the short amount of time we have left
before the registration needs to be finalized, in order for us to start researching
and give our best in preparing for the conference. We believe that in today’s
world, there is a need to invest and youth to enable platforms for dialogue and
cooperation, as well as constructive exchange between countries. 
Help us spread the word of EMIS MUN and our
vision by sharing this campaign using the Indiegogo tools. Your help is immensely
appreciated and every little effort counts!
Thank you very much!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The Foundation 2 F.A.M.E is a 501(c)(3) youth empowerment agency designed to support, motivate, and uplift the inner city’s youth. Geared towards teens of underdeveloped communities, The Foundation 2 F.A.M.E is launching The Musical Theory 2 F.A.M.E project. Which, harnesses musical and artistic expression to offer teens a reminder that their future isn’t dictated by present circumstances. While earning a stipend for their efforts, all participants will gain substantial exposure to the realms of creativity and education. From promoting scholastic excellence, leadership, entrepreneurialism, business etiquette, financial literacy and all areas in between The Musical Theory 2 F.A.M.E will be the source of providing teens with the intangibles to obtain all their aspirations.</p>
<p>The Musical Theory 2 F.A.M.E project will start from June, 1st 2016 through August, 1st 2016. In order for participants to attend The Musical theory program, specific requirements and guidelines must be met. All participants must maintain a specific GPA within their educational institution and adhere to a strict code of conduct. Confident with the success of the 1<sup>st</sup> year trial run, the board members of The Foundation 2 F.A.M.E believe there will be many more years to come. The Foundation 2 F.A.M.E strives to mold the leaders of tomorrow by challenging participants to Follow, Aspire, Multiply, and Elevate themselves today.                        <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">                              </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Vision          </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">             </b></p>
<p>Our vision is to change our communities through engagement. Music and art have the capacity to bring all walks of life together, therefore; the impact it would leave on a community is infinite. With unemployment, violence, and crime at alarming rates, we aim to show our youth numerous ways to channel their energy into something positive and worthwhile. Our foundation diligently aims to make leaders of society by providing a sanctuary for the inner city’s diamonds in the rough. We envision facilitating Business workshops, financial literacy and music centers to equip participants with tools needed to reach heights they never dreamed of. Show your support by donating to art, education, and cultural preservation for our youth.                        </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Necessities</b></p>
<p>The operational side of such a program requires a significant amount of manpower, facilities, and equipment.

A core group of community members, who became the school's teachers, felt a mandate to contribute to the reconstruction of a region that had been torn apart by 12 years of civil war in the 1980's and 1990's. <br/></p>
<p>Through the creation of art projects involving children, youth, adults, and the elderly, the teachers worked to alleviate the traumas of war. <br/></p>

<br/><p>These diverse projects were always collaborative, and often involved the creation of large murals by the entire community.<br/></p>
<p>Over the past decade, The School of Art has used ""<b>The Perquín Model</b>"" as it has expanded its reach into countries around the world, including Guatemala, Northern Ireland, Colombia, and many others. The School works in collaboration with human rights organizations, NGOs, universities, and local health units.<br/></p>
<p>Led by artist <b>Claudia Bernardi</b>, the creation of ""<b>Walls of Hope</b>"" murals has facilitated community building and established bridges of diplomacy in societies suffering state terror, violations of human rights, and forced exile.  <br/></p>
<p>The Perquín Model has been welcomed by victims of violence who find in the creation of collaborative art projects a way to retain and disseminate their silenced voices and never-spoken histories, and to move forward in community development.</p>

<p>Recently, our home base, <b>The School of Art in Perquín</b>, has been facing its most significant challenge to
date.<span>  Increased violence caused by
growth of an economy based on <i>narco</i> trafficking has threatened the stability of
the communities in northern El Salvador -- communities that are also being affected by a constant exodus of
youth who seek safety by making the long journey as undocumented, unaccompanied
minors towards the United States.</span></p>
<p>It
is within this climate that the School has been invited to develop a second

<p>The

<p>These projects
are created directly by participants on whom trauma, violence, and prejudice have
been inflicted through political duress, state terror, wars and/or armed
conflicts. The participants decide on the theme and narration of each piece
with the intention of producing a visual testimony representing their recent
history.<span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>These collaborative art projects
expand from creativity towards diplomacy and the demand for respect for human rights. <b>Our work is political, but not

A core group of community members, who became the school's teachers, felt a mandate to contribute to the reconstruction of a region that had been torn apart by 12 years of civil war in the 1980's and 1990's. 
Through the creation of art projects involving children, youth, adults, and the elderly, the teachers worked to alleviate the traumas of war. 


These diverse projects were always collaborative, and often involved the creation of large murals by the entire community.
Over the past decade, The School of Art has used ""The Perquín Model"" as it has expanded its reach into countries around the world, including Guatemala, Northern Ireland, Colombia, and many others. The School works in collaboration with human rights organizations, NGOs, universities, and local health units.
Led by artist Claudia Bernardi, the creation of ""Walls of Hope"" murals has facilitated community building and established bridges of diplomacy in societies suffering state terror, violations of human rights, and forced exile.  
The Perquín Model has been welcomed by victims of violence who find in the creation of collaborative art projects a way to retain and disseminate their silenced voices and never-spoken histories, and to move forward in community development.









Recently, our home base, The School of Art in Perquín, has been facing its most significant challenge to
date.  Increased violence caused by
growth of an economy based on narco trafficking has threatened the stability of
the communities in northern El Salvador -- communities that are also being affected by a constant exodus of
youth who seek safety by making the long journey as undocumented, unaccompanied
minors towards the United States.
It
is within this climate that the School has been invited to develop a second
location in the current relative stability of Bogotá.  
Fe y Alegría, Schools that Change the
World, an international agency that supports high-quality
education as a tool for social transformation, has invited the School of Art to replicate the Perquín Model in Bogotá, Colombia.  (See more of what they do at http://www.feyalegria.org/en#.)
Fe y Alegría has agreed to provide room and board
for a year to three artist- teachers from the School of Art in Perquín -- but additional funds are needed for living stipends, art supplies and materials, and
transportation.  
  



The School of Art in Perquín will “nest” in Bogotá, Colombia,
starting in November 2015, for an initial period of one year.
Three
teachers from the School (America Argentina Vaquerano Romero, Claudia Verenice
Flores Escolero and Rosa del Carmen Argueta) will lead workshops and
classes with a range of local schools, community
organizations, children’s advocacy groups and women’s cooperatives. We will develop workshops that use recycled
 material for collaborative art projects. We will aim to work with agencies that congregate kids at 
risk for projects similar to the ones we created in 
Perquin.
Founder and
Artistic Director Claudia Bernardi will join the Salvadoran teachers
from June to December 2016.



To make this year-long residency possible, The School of Art has a minimum need for $22,600.  Here's how our funding goal breaks down: 
Salaries
Three Artist-Teachers,
$400 per month each, for 12 months
Total    $ 14,400
Art Materials and Studio Costs 
Mural paints, brushes, drawing and art materials for children and youth projects; Internet;
incidentals

Total  $ 5,100 

Transportation
Travel to mural sites and meetings with participants (public transportation within Bogotá)

Total  
$ 500
(Total Operating Budget = $20,000)
Indiegogo & Bank Fees, Fiscal Sponsorship Fee   $ 2,600
GRAND TOTAL OF FUNDS NEEDED    $
22,600
The money will be handled and administered through our fiscal sponsor, Intersection for the Arts, which is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.  This means your donations are 100% tax-deductible!We have lots of wonderful perks to offer our donors, such as hand-crafted jewelry by Rosa del Carmen...
...and beautiful poster prints, like this one, by Claudia Bernardi!
  
 
The
mission of the School of Art in Perquín and Walls of Hope is to facilitate community-based projects that engage children, youth, and adults in the making of art that serves as a component of community-building. 
These projects
are created directly by participants on whom trauma, violence, and prejudice have
been inflicted through political duress, state terror, wars and/or armed
conflicts. The participants decide on the theme and narration of each piece
with the intention of producing a visual testimony representing their recent
history.
These collaborative art projects
expand from creativity towards diplomacy and the demand for respect for human rights. Our work is political, but not
partisan.



The community art
projects created via the Perquín Model focus on the challenges posed by
intercommunal and societal conflicts in today’s world. Our
projects instill artistic skills and practical expertise in participants, in a new model of art
education.The School of
Art in Perquín envisions a new methodology for
peace-building and transitional justice through the praxis of beauty and the
tenacity of hope.This “nesting”
of the School in Bogotá is the first step towards disseminating the Perquín Model throughout Latin America.
  
Our model of arts education and transitional justice has proved 
effective in countries around the world since 2005.  It's a powerful 
method of bringing communities together and bridging the deep divides 
born of war and trauma.  But El Salvador is on track to become the ""deadliest peace-time country in the world"" (AP, 2015). 
 Gang violence has erupted after the collapse of a 2012 truce between 
gangs brokered by the Salvadoran government.  Homicides now average 15 
per day in the capital.
We request your help to establish a second, more stable base for our school in Colombia, so that we may carry on our work in the hope of establishing strategies for conflict resolution in El Salvador and other suffering communities in the future.

If we don't raise the funds we need we won't be able to invite the international guests we hope to attract.
Our overall aim is to make this the gold standard of citizen led 
politics festivals in Ireland. Your funding will help us to build our 
reputation and to develop our brand, capacity and reputation as a 
festival not to be missed!
Should The Limerick Spring become a success it will be another 
positive story for Limerick and will hopefully inspire other towns and 
cities to put on their own local events that engage people in politics 
in ways that are fresh, fun and inspiring. 
  Don't worry if you have no money! More than half of our events are free and if you want to volunteer your time or energy instead you can talk to us too. 
Please do share our festival campaign with your friends and family 
and let's aim to work together to make The Limerick Spring - Festival of
 Politics and Ideas happen in 2016!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Your contributions will fund the first phase of this project that will allow us to spread our message by manufacturing T-shirts, protest and yard signs, buttons and decals,  anything that can be publicly displayed and will remind us that we are a community that rejects the deplorable moral values of Donald Trump and his presidency.</p>

<h3>The Logo</h3>
<p>The logo is a satire showing the orange head and comb-over hair which personifies Trumps vanity.  The message ""Not My Values"" indicts Donald Trump as having values that are in complete contrast to our American Values.</p>

Why is this happening? It is because smart phones have replaced the computers in informal economies. Laptops are a luxury that only a sliver of the population has access to, while smart phones enable Africans to engage to further specialised education, business development, collaboration of ideas with a wider audience, and marketing and co-branding through social media platforms. What does this mean to Emerging African Entrepreneurs?

We are Emerging African Entrepreneurs (EAE), a social enterprise based in Vancouver and Kampala, the capital of Uganda. We work with people in the informal economy as they build their entrepreneurship skills, develop their businesses and break out of subsistence level poverty.   Action Plan:May 24th, Founder, Orianna Lacey will be flying down to be in Kampala and sorrounding rural areas - with her team of volunteers for five weeks. We will be meeting with key players in the entrepreneur industry in microfunfing, mobile companies, inspirational speakers, and other highly influential industry disruptors. During that time, we will tour churches and schools to help light up the eyes and hearts of potential youth entrepreneurs. Furthermore, we will be building partnerships between local micro-businesses and we will also offer micro financing to as many micro businesses who show potential and passion. The EAE team is currently in the final stages of building the teaching and business partnership building itinerary in Uganda and Kenya - when we have a set itinerary - you will be the first to know!  Our Mission: Promote collaboration, sharing of ideas and resources amongst the 52,6% of the African population who are self employed, cultivating a network of people working with a common set of values and approaches, equipped with the skills required to succeed in a small business. Partner with as many local entrepreneurs in business, contributing our skills in marketing and business to theirs, creating employment, improving household incomes and generating EAE funding.Our Vision:Launched in February 2017, our strategic goals is to be 100% self-funded by the end of 2 years. We will do this by narrowing our focus to developing strategic partnerships with entrepreneurs in the following countries:  Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya countries. Repayments will refuel our working capital, which will in turn provide us with the abilities to fund bigger, more audacious projects that can provide even more job opportunities to local Africans.  We need to raise $7500 in order to develop our entrepreneurship program and support emerging African micro businesses, to develop our School Program, and to expand our Business Partnership Program. I understand that you may be donating to a bunch of charities and you may be just plain tired of people stopping you in the street and asking you for a life-long contribution. We promise that we are worth the second look and by offering a one-off donation you will be offering an African Entrepreneur the opportunity to do what they love and be able to actually make a living for them and their families. The buck does not stop with your contribution, we will continue to send you updates and let you know exactly what kind of impact you have had.  Uganda and much of Africa yield a similar demographic pyramid with a bulk of the population  being youth. Quality education is required to accelerate the country’s socio-economic development through making the young population functionally literate and productive.     Self employment constitutes 45.6% of employment for men and 60.9% of employment for women between the ages of 14 and 64 years of age. The average lifespan in Africa is 60 - 64 years.  Teaching entrepreneur skills is what the people asked for during our research of the informal sector. Your contribution will help prop up the foundations of this emerging new model of international social development work.   Africa’s education crisis seldom makes media headlines or socio economic summit agendas and this needs to change. With > 68% of the population hovering at a primary education or below, progress towards universal enriched primary and secondary education has come to a dead standstill. It is up to our young, fresh-faced, knowledgeable team members at Emerging African Entrepreneurs to change that! #TheEntrepreneurGivingEffect  Africa is changing faster and more furiously than anyone imagined. Africans are eager to rise to the occasion and take their seat in business and a clean government. They deserve a place at the table, and increasingly they are getting one. A new nickname is starting to catch on for Africa: the ""mobile continent"" with researchers predicting internet use on mobile phones will increase 20-fold in the next five years – double the rate of growth in the rest of the world. Why is this happening? It is because smart phones have replaced the computers in informal economies. Laptops are a luxury that only a sliver of the population has access to, while smart phones enable Africans to engage to further specialised education, business development, collaboration of ideas with a wider audience, and marketing and co-branding through social media platforms. What does this mean to Emerging African Entrepreneurs? It means that now, more than ever, creating an online presence, even one as simple as a Facebook page is now accessible to more Africans.   With such incredible potential and your ability to help thousands of struggling entrepreneurs bring their ideas to market and support their families, how can you possible say no!But keep reading! We are just getting started!   1) Building Strategic Local PartnershipsOne of our founding principals in building a social enterprise is the importance of building local partnerships.Partnerships may be formal or informal, involve networking or detailed relationship-building, and create grass-roots relationships and/or strategic alliances. Developing partnerships is critical to the success of any community initiative.  We already have a local team members developing strategic partnerships at the grass roots level.  Partnership will provide both an improved income for our business partners as well as an income stream for our program. 2) Community Training & Outreach  Our values include local ownership of change, using funds responsibly, and working with long-term sustainability in mind. Our vision is to build a creative and powerful informal economy, filled with people that are equipped with the knowledge, the skills, and the money to succeed in their micro businesses. After consulting with local micro entrepreneurs, marketing/business development, business planning, financial skills and affordable microfinance as their barriers to success. acilitate knowledge sharing, networking and collaboration in business. Our mission is to be the hub of micro business in Uganda and East AFrica, creating an uproar of entrepreneurship.    The team behind Emerging Entrepreneurs have the passion and experience needed to understand the complex nature of informal economies, business resources, and minimal finances and we know how to get things done! We are all so committed to creating real and lasting impact. When this campaign ends, we don't just go back to our day jobs. A slice of each and every day will always go towards Emerging African Entrepreneurs.           Orianna Lacey (Founder & Business Program Designer and Facilitator)Orianna has worked in the marketing and business sector for the last 10 years on digital campaigns, design, social responsibility, leadership training, micro financing programs and resource fundraising.

</div></div><p>El Trío Nueva Colombia es considerado por expertos como punto de quiebre en la música colombiana de la región andina, y como referente ineludible en la historia musical del país. Desde su creación hace 30 años, ha estado integrado por Germán Darío Pérez Salazar en el piano, arreglos, composición y dirección, Ricardo Pedraza Medina en el Tiple  (cordófono típico colombiano) y Mauricio Acosta Avellaneda en el Contrabajo. Son innumerables los conciertos que han ofrecido en más de 15 países de Europa y América a lo largo de su carrera artística. Su director ha recibido en repetidas oportunidades homenajes en vida, como uno de los músicos más destacados de la música colombiana de la región andina. Su obra compositiva ha sido ampliamente premiada, alcanzando a la fecha 23 primeros puestos en composición en los más importantes certámenes y festivales del género. 4 de estas obras premiadas están incluidas en el presente trabajo discográfico. Otras más fueron escritas especialmente para este proyecto por su director, y otras son bellas obras de grandes compositores colombianos, como Adolfo Mejía, León Cardona, Francisco Cristancho, Jesús Alberto Rey y Santiago Medina. En total el disco consta de 15 cortes.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481205749/oisx3qdfzozwydzfzzzb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>El Sello Hoot/Wisdom Recordings de  “Florida Atlantic University”de Boca Ratón, Florida EEUU, escogió este proyecto musical para apoyar todo el proceso de grabación, edición, mezcla y masterización.

El Trío Nueva Colombia es considerado por expertos como punto de quiebre en la música colombiana de la región andina, y como referente ineludible en la historia musical del país. Desde su creación hace 30 años, ha estado integrado por Germán Darío Pérez Salazar en el piano, arreglos, composición y dirección, Ricardo Pedraza Medina en el Tiple  (cordófono típico colombiano) y Mauricio Acosta Avellaneda en el Contrabajo. Son innumerables los conciertos que han ofrecido en más de 15 países de Europa y América a lo largo de su carrera artística. Su director ha recibido en repetidas oportunidades homenajes en vida, como uno de los músicos más destacados de la música colombiana de la región andina. Su obra compositiva ha sido ampliamente premiada, alcanzando a la fecha 23 primeros puestos en composición en los más importantes certámenes y festivales del género. 4 de estas obras premiadas están incluidas en el presente trabajo discográfico. Otras más fueron escritas especialmente para este proyecto por su director, y otras son bellas obras de grandes compositores colombianos, como Adolfo Mejía, León Cardona, Francisco Cristancho, Jesús Alberto Rey y Santiago Medina. En total el disco consta de 15 cortes.El Sello Hoot/Wisdom Recordings de  “Florida Atlantic University”de Boca Ratón, Florida EEUU, escogió este proyecto musical para apoyar todo el proceso de grabación, edición, mezcla y masterización. Allí el trío pudo contar con los mejores equipos posibles, un piano incomparable, pero sobre todo, un equipo de colaboradores comprometidos y del más alto nivel humano y técnico, además de muy talentosos a nivel musical, encabezado por Alejandro Sánchez-Samper, profesor asociado de la universidad. Cada detalle se tuvo en cuenta y el Master es una pieza realmente impecable. Estamos seguros de tener hoy en nuestras manos, listo para prensaje (copias) un trabajo cuidadoso, delicado, pulcro y de un altísimo nivel musical.   Con este nuevo album, los melómanos de todo el mundo se podrán acercar con deleite a las músicas de la región andina colombiana, ya que la propuesta presentada es muy colombiana, y al mismo tiempo muy universal.BackgroundPiano, Tiple (typical Colombian chordophone), and Contrabass; an interesting format in Andean Colombian music. The resulting sound mixes a classical, jazzistic, and universal flavor of the piano and the contrabass, with the ancestral and very Colombian Tiple, a sound that reinforces the essence of the music interpreted in an academic and modern way, but with a prominent Colombian flavor.A new music for Colombia, a new sound; a new look at the traditional rhythms of the Andean region, sustained with coherent compositions that use a harmonious rhythmic language and a renewed melodic one; a proposal that has been accepted, respected and considered a pattern to be followed by other musicians and several other Colombian ensembles, and which has converted the “Trio Nueva Colombia” and its director into important referents in the musical history of Colombia.Considered by experts as a group of the highest artistic level,  we find in the trio´s music the excellence,  interpretative sensibility, good taste in the arrangements and mastery in the execution of each instrument.¿Por qué necesitamos tu colaboración?Con el respaldo del sello Hoot/Wisdom Recordings de  “Florida Atlantic University se realizó todo el trabajo de grabación, edición, mezlcla y masterización del álbum “Mi Camino”.

De esa manera convocó a Ricardo Pedraza M. y a Mauricio Acosta A. a que lo acompañaran a integrar una agrupación conformada por Piano, Tiple y Contrabajo respectivamente. Dada la naturaleza novedosa y revolucionaria, en términos musicales, de las obras que empezó a interpretar esta naciente agrupación, el nombre surgió casi de manera obligada: Trío Nueva Colombia. Comenzaba así una de las más importantes renovaciones de la música de la región andina Colombiana. Los bambucos, guabinas, pasillos, danzas (ritmos típicos colombianos), empezaban a sonar diferente, con armonías novedosas,  alusiones al jazz y a la música académica, La música colombiana, con los aires oxigenadores y renovadores que le inyectó la sonoridad del Trío Nueva Colombia, y las composiciones innovadoras de Germán Darío Pérez, empezaría a llamar la atención de nuevas generaciones, que notaban con interés cómo se podía hacer música colombiana para los siglos XX y XXI. Era indispensable que una agrupación de adolescentes en ese entonces, como el Trío Nueva Colombia y específicamente su director Germán Darío Pérez S., rompiera estándares, con una transgresión aquí, otra allí, para empezar un estilo que definitivamente marcaría el inicio de una nueva etapa en esta música.¿Quién es Germán Darío Pérez S. Pianista y compositor ampliamente premiado en la historia de festivales de música colombiana de la región andina. La combinación de su ancestro familiar arraigado a las tradiciones musicales colombianas, y sus estudios académicos, sumados a su creatividad lo llevó a la búsqueda de un nuevo lenguaje musical, con una gran riqueza rítmica, tímbrica y armónica, dando como resultado un estilo propio que abrió el camino hacia nuevas perspectivas en la Música Andina Colombiana. Es uno de los iniciadores de la principal renovación de esta música en los últimos 30 años. Sus composiciones son interpretadas permanentemente por solistas y ensambles de Colombia y del exterior, algunas de ellas en escenarios tan emblemáticos como el Southbank Centre de Londres y el Carnegie Hall, entre muchísimos otros. Su obra lo ha convertido en un referente ineludible en la historia musical de Colombia.He has composed copious Andean Regional Colombian music, and has received many awards. He is one of the initiators of the renewal that this music has had in the last 30 years. His works are interpreted continuously by soloists and groups in Colombia and abroad in . He is also the arranger for several other national artists.Algunos datos importantes:*Respaldo de la Orquesta Filarmónica de Bogotá para la realización del proyecto denominado “Germán Darío Pérez Salazar, cinco obras de cámara” CD y libro de partituras.* Artista incluido en la propuesta que permitió la declaratoria “Bogotá, Capital creativa de la Música”, año 2011 por la Unesco.* Director artístico del Festival Internacional Latinoamérica de Concierto en sus versiones 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 y 2015 (Bogotá, Colombia) http://latinoamericadeconcierto.com/ .* Desde 1981 hasta la fecha, concertista en Colombia, en Europa y Latinoamérica, como solista y con el Trío Nueva Colombia, además de incontables colaboraciones para otros artistas.* Docente área de Piano en la Universidad Pedagógica Nacional desde 2012 hasta la fecha.* Docente ensambles de Música Colombiana, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, 2014.* Desde 1886 fundador, director, arreglista y compositor para el Trío Nueva Colombia* Artista homenajeado en el año 2003  el “Festival del Pasillo” en Aguadas (Caldas, Colombia)* Artista homenajeado en el año 2008 el X Festival Antología de la Música Colombiana en Paipa (Boyacá, Colombia)* Artista homenajeado el 17 de noviembre del año 2010 por el Banco de la República, mediante el ofrecimiento de un concierto monográfico en su nombre, en la Sala de Conciertos de la Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango (Bogotá, Colombia).* Jurado Calificador a los más importantes certámenes de Interpretación y de Composición en todo el País:Listado de composiciones premiadas de Germán Darío Pérez S2015 Artesano de poemas (Pasillo) Primer puesto obra inédita Festival del Tiple en clave contemporáneo2015 Chilita (Pasillo) Mejor obra inédita instrumental Festival Mono Núñez2014 Don Giovanni…Parra (Bambuco) Primer puesto modalidad pequeño formato, Concurso de composición Bogoatá Caítal Creartiva de la Música, Instituto Distrital de las Artes, Idartes.2012 León Cardona (Bambuco) Primer puesto modalidad pequeño formato, concurso de composición Ciudad de Bogotá, Instituto Distrital de las Artes2009 La Gorda Marrana (Pasillo) Mejor obra inédita instrumental Festival Mono Núñez2008 Celitos (Pasillo) Mejor obra inédita instrumental Festival Mono Núñez2006 Bambina (Bambuco-Guabina) Mejor obra inédita instrumental Festival Hato Viejo-Cotrafa.2005 Pa‟los Palos (Guabina) Mejor obra inédita instrumental Festival Hato Viejo-Cotrafa.2002 Tan Cerca pero tan lejos (Pasillo) Mejor obra inédita instrumental Festival Hato Viejo–Cotrafa.2000 Seré papá (Pasillo) Mejor obra inédita instrumental Festival Mono Núñez (Ginebra)1999 Toña la Blanca (Pasillo) Primer puesto Concurso de composición musical Carlos Vieco (Medellín)1995 Ilusa (Danza) Mejor obra inédita instrumental Festival Mono Núñez (Ginebra)1995 Minimito (Bambuco) Primer puesto Concurso de composición Instituto Distrital de Cultura y Turismo1995 Después de todo (Guabina) Primer puesto Festival Nacional del Bambuco (Neiva)1994 Insistime (Pasillo) Primer puesto Festival Nacional del Bambuco (Neiva)1993 Un bambuco muy cortico para mi amiga que toca el clarinete (Bambuco) Primer puesto Festival Nacional del Bambuco (Neiva)1992 Garrapatica (Bambuco) Mención de Honor Festival Mono Núñez (Ginebra)1990 Pitituya (Bambuco) Primer puesto Festival Nacional del Bambuco (Neiva)1989 Pa`Juancho (Bambuco) Primer puesto Festival Nacional del Bambuco (Neiva)1988 Ancestro (Bambuco) Mejor obra inédita instrumental Festival Mono Núñez (Ginebra)1987 Locuras (Bambuco) Primer puesto Festival Nacional del Bambuco1985 Recuerdos (Bambuco) Tercer puesto Festival Nacional del Bambuco (Neiva)Composition awards Germán Darío Pérez2015 Artesano de poemas (Pasillo) First place, Festival del Tiple en clave contemporáneo2015 Chilita (Pasillo) First place, Festival Mono Núñez2014 Don Giovanni … Parra (Bambuco) First place.

""Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself.""- John Dewey

""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.""
- Nelson Mandela


| Who is behind Discipline?


Thank you for reading my first crowdfunding attempt! My name is Daniel Waddington. I am 34 year old handyman-entrepreneur and I have had the privilege of enjoying a lifestyle that has taught me the value of gratitude, fitness, nutrition, yoga and meditation. I have always been passionate about helping and teaching people and I would like to give back to the community by empowering the next generation. I am assembling a team of mentors and volunteers and together, with your generous donations, we are going to teach the science of success to young people!
 

 

| What are our Goals?


It's our belief that public education is failing to provide young people with skills in areas vital to success. Such areas as personal finance, food production/nutrition, physical fitness/martial arts as well as physical, mental and emotional well being are being overlooked as young people are prepared for a life in a corporate, consumer driven world. 

I believe that times are changing and the young people of today would benefit from learning time-tested techniques for achieving success. Hard work, honesty, personal excellence and perseverance have - and will continue to - earn success for the people who choose to practice these habits. 

 


 
| Why Crowdfunding?

Crowdfunding will help give economically disadvantaged young people the tools they need to learn positive, life changing habits that will help them succeed in any endeavour. 

I intend to purchase the equipment a person would need to begin to earn a living and put into practice some positive, life affirming habits that the younger generation could put into practice for the rest of their lives. 

work gloves (~$10)

backpack (~$150)
safety glasses (~$10)
hiking/work boots (~$140)
branded uniform t-shirt (~$30)
yoga mat / meditation pillow (~$40)
thermos (~$20)

 

             
 
                         | How We Plan to Succeed


I am able to provide guidance, mentorship and employment for 4 young adults, initially. I hope to crowdfund the equipment they will need to be healthy and active and the tools they need to earn a living. 
Once the successful applicant has all of the tools they need to succeed, myself and other mentors enrolled in the program will provide guidance in areas of our expertise. 

 


Home Maintenance / Renovation
Yoga / Fitness / Martial Arts
Outdoor Activity / Survival Skills
Nutrition / Food Production

 



 
I hope to enrol four applicants in this program. The $1600 will be spent allocating a budget of $400 to each successful applicant for tools and equipment needed. 
The more donations that are received, the more people we can help! We'll post regular updates on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram (@discipline.dan) and on our Website.

<h4><b>Pourquoi cette journée?</b></h4>
<p>Depuis
plusieurs années, de nombreux acteurs et organismes, comme l’Organisation Mondiale
de la Santé (OMS), dénoncent le manque de formation des professionnels de la
santé en matière d’allaitement. L’impact de cette situation sur l’allaitement
au Québec est réel. Par exemple, <strong>alors
qu’environ 85% des mères québécoises allaitent leur enfant à la naissance,
seule la moitié d’entre-elles allaitent de manière exclusive à leur sortie du
lieu de naissance</strong>. Et le plus important est que cela se produit souvent à
l’encontre de l’objectif initial des mères. Le soutien qui leur est offert est
trop souvent insuffisant ou inadéquat, les professionnels de la santé étant bien
intentionnés, mais peu préparés à fournir des soins pertinents pour un
allaitement réussi. Les femmes, qui manquent de soutien et reçoivent souvent
des messages divergents de la part de ces professionnels, ne sont donc
pas dans les conditions favorables à une bonne expérience d’allaitement. Il en
résulte beaucoup de souffrance physique (e.g. mamelons douloureux, gerçures) et
psychologique (e.g. anxiété, sentiments de culpabilité). De meilleures
pratiques professionnelles pourraient éviter ces souffrances aux mères et améliorer leur expérience d’allaitement. Nous organisons donc un colloque sur la formation en allaitement des futurs professionnels de la santé au Québec.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><h4><b>Comment se
déroulera-t-elle?</b></h4>
<p>Cette journée réunira plusieurs
professeurs, enseignants et responsables des programmes de formation des
professionnels de la santé des universités et cégeps du Québec - soit des <b>médecins, infirmières, nutritionnistes,
sages-femmes, dentistes, pharmaciens</b> - ainsi que des représentants de
différents ordres professionnels<b>. </b>Pour les
participants, ce colloque sera une occasion d’échanger et de réseauter pour
améliorer les programmes de formation des professionnels de la santé en matière
d’allaitement, au bénéfice des familles du Québec.</p>
<p>Pour
cela, divers conférenciers de renommée nationale et internationale en formation
et pratique professionnelle en santé, ou détenant une expertise sur la
collaboration interprofesionnelle en tant que moteur de changement, prendront
la parole au cours de la journée pour outiller les participants et les aider à
mener cette réflexion.</p>

des messages divergents de la part de ces professionnels, ne sont donc
pas dans les conditions favorables à une bonne expérience d’allaitement. Il en
résulte beaucoup de souffrance physique (e.g. mamelons douloureux, gerçures) et
psychologique (e.g. anxiété, sentiments de culpabilité). De meilleures
pratiques professionnelles pourraient éviter ces souffrances aux mères et améliorer leur expérience d’allaitement. Nous organisons donc un colloque sur la formation en allaitement des futurs professionnels de la santé au Québec.
Comment se
déroulera-t-elle?
Cette journée réunira plusieurs
professeurs, enseignants et responsables des programmes de formation des
professionnels de la santé des universités et cégeps du Québec - soit des médecins, infirmières, nutritionnistes,
sages-femmes, dentistes, pharmaciens - ainsi que des représentants de
différents ordres professionnels. Pour les
participants, ce colloque sera une occasion d’échanger et de réseauter pour
améliorer les programmes de formation des professionnels de la santé en matière
d’allaitement, au bénéfice des familles du Québec.
Pour
cela, divers conférenciers de renommée nationale et internationale en formation
et pratique professionnelle en santé, ou détenant une expertise sur la
collaboration interprofesionnelle en tant que moteur de changement, prendront
la parole au cours de la journée pour outiller les participants et les aider à
mener cette réflexion.

À quoi servira votre
contribution ?

Nous avons besoin de vous pour
garantir la réussite de cette journée de réflexion et assurer la pérennité de
nos activités!
Votre précieuse contribution
nous servira:


Principalement à financer l’activité ludique qui entamera la
journée : l’intervention de la troupe Parminou. La création sur mesure de
scénettes de théâtre est associée à des frais qui varient
selon la durée de l’intervention et le nombre de comédiens y prenant part. Votre
contribution servira donc principalement à couvrir ces frais. Nous vous
encourageons par ailleurs à aller visiter le site de cette troupe talentueuse : www.parminou.com.

Elle servira aussi à assumer divers frais associés à l’organisation de
la journée, comme la participation des conférenciers, ou encore les boîtes à
lunch des participants.
Enfin, elle permettra au comité formation, dont nous faisons partie, de
poursuivre les activités reliées à sa mission.

Qui sommes-nous ?
Le Mouvement Allaitement du Québec (MAQ) veut
contribuer à rendre les environnements favorables à l’allaitement, et ce, dans
un contexte de développement optimal des jeunes enfants et de bien-être des
femmes, des familles et de la société. Ces environnements (lieu de travail, milieux
hospitaliers, etc) se doivent de respecter toutes les femmes et toutes les
familles.
Le MAQ est un lieu de concertation indépendant
ouvert à l’ensemble des personnes et des organisations qui adhèrent à ses
principes.
Le comité formation du MAQ, dont nous
faisons partie, s’intéresse plus particulièrement aux environnements d’ordre
institutionnel, c’est à dire les cégeps et les universités. Plus précisément,
notre comité travaille dans le but que tous les professionnels de la santé
possèdent un bagage de connaissances minimales en allaitement à la fin de leurs
études, et ce, peu importe leur spécialité.
Pour plus d’informations sur le MAQ, n’hésitez

<h3></h3>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our names are Anjana Nair, Brianna Broderick, and Catherine Chen and we are participating in our local ""SkillsUSA"" competition in an attempt to raise awareness and funds for the Alzheimer's Association. We also hope to prevent Alzheimer's disease by educating others about the risks and impacts of the disease on the victim and those closest to them.</span><br/></p>
<div>
<p>One of our team members, Anjana Nair, has lost her grandfather to this devastating disease, and we want to make sure that no other family experiences this horrifying illness. Victims of Alzheimer's slowly lose their memories and forget the ones they love the most. They lose themselves and this disease ultimately makes them a skeleton of who they once were. They can no longer remember who their children are, who their true love is, and what they have done throughout their lives. This illness splits families and causes immense suffering for caregivers and close ones; we need to stop this disease and end this devastation.</p>
<p>With your help, we can eradicate this disease once and for all. Your donations and funds can help us get in front of lawmakers and Congress members, so we can put Alzheimer's disease as a top priority in the White House; they can help us get the tools to educate future generations about Alzheimer's and spread prevention techniques to elders at nursing homes; they can increase our popularity in our community, so we can host several events to promote our cause; they can help us fund new research to find a cure within the next 20 years. We need your help. Without it, Alzheimer's will continue to be a disease that wrecks and kills the lives of your friends, family, and you. An estimated 14 million people will die of Alzheimer's in 2050. We need to act now.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>About <i>The Wish of Jellyfish</i>
</h3>
<p>Our team name is ""The Wish of Jellyfish"" because recently, scientists have found that a calcium-binding protein in jellyfish called aequorin has the ability to protect nerve cells in the brain. They are now testing the aequorin protein's effect in young animals and hopefully, it can finally lead to a cure for Alzheimer's. Our team is promoting and participating in new research being done to cure Alzheimer's and we hope with our project, we can inspire the next generation to investigate the disease and eradicate it for good.</p>
<p>First, we plan to raise awareness and educate our classmates and peers about the true meaning of Alzheimer's. Many have heard about the disease, but they do not understand what people with Alzheimer's suffer through. By conducting experiments in the class and allowing peers to get a hands-on experience of Alzheimer's, we hope to invigorate not only the students, but also their families and friends to help this cause. Previously, our group had set up a booth at our school's Back-to-School Night and we were fairly successful in raising some donations and awareness among the parents and students there. We wish to do more for the cause in the near future, including: </p>
<p>1. Holding an ALZ day at our school in which we educate our peers and teachers about the impacts of Alzheimer's disease and what Alzheimer's really is</p>
<p>2. Meeting with our local representative in Congress and advocating for Alzheimer's</p>
<p>3. Attending support groups and understanding what caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients have to go through</p>
<p>4. Holding fundraisers and awareness events around the community </p>
<p>5. Holding musical performances at nursing homes in the county because music is found to stimulate brain activity and prevent neurodegeneration</p>
<p>6. Introducing pet therapy to patients with Alzheimer's at nursing homes, so we can let patients know they are not alone</p>

Our names are Anjana Nair, Brianna Broderick, and Catherine Chen and we are participating in our local ""SkillsUSA"" competition in an attempt to raise awareness and funds for the Alzheimer's Association. We also hope to prevent Alzheimer's disease by educating others about the risks and impacts of the disease on the victim and those closest to them.

One of our team members, Anjana Nair, has lost her grandfather to this devastating disease, and we want to make sure that no other family experiences this horrifying illness. Victims of Alzheimer's slowly lose their memories and forget the ones they love the most. They lose themselves and this disease ultimately makes them a skeleton of who they once were. They can no longer remember who their children are, who their true love is, and what they have done throughout their lives. This illness splits families and causes immense suffering for caregivers and close ones; we need to stop this disease and end this devastation.
With your help, we can eradicate this disease once and for all. Your donations and funds can help us get in front of lawmakers and Congress members, so we can put Alzheimer's disease as a top priority in the White House; they can help us get the tools to educate future generations about Alzheimer's and spread prevention techniques to elders at nursing homes; they can increase our popularity in our community, so we can host several events to promote our cause; they can help us fund new research to find a cure within the next 20 years. We need your help. Without it, Alzheimer's will continue to be a disease that wrecks and kills the lives of your friends, family, and you. An estimated 14 million people will die of Alzheimer's in 2050. We need to act now.

About The Wish of Jellyfish

Our team name is ""The Wish of Jellyfish"" because recently, scientists have found that a calcium-binding protein in jellyfish called aequorin has the ability to protect nerve cells in the brain. They are now testing the aequorin protein's effect in young animals and hopefully, it can finally lead to a cure for Alzheimer's. Our team is promoting and participating in new research being done to cure Alzheimer's and we hope with our project, we can inspire the next generation to investigate the disease and eradicate it for good.
First, we plan to raise awareness and educate our classmates and peers about the true meaning of Alzheimer's. Many have heard about the disease, but they do not understand what people with Alzheimer's suffer through. By conducting experiments in the class and allowing peers to get a hands-on experience of Alzheimer's, we hope to invigorate not only the students, but also their families and friends to help this cause. Previously, our group had set up a booth at our school's Back-to-School Night and we were fairly successful in raising some donations and awareness among the parents and students there. We wish to do more for the cause in the near future, including: 
1. Holding an ALZ day at our school in which we educate our peers and teachers about the impacts of Alzheimer's disease and what Alzheimer's really is
2. Meeting with our local representative in Congress and advocating for Alzheimer's
3. Attending support groups and understanding what caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients have to go through
4. Holding fundraisers and awareness events around the community 
5. Holding musical performances at nursing homes in the county because music is found to stimulate brain activity and prevent neurodegeneration
6. Introducing pet therapy to patients with Alzheimer's at nursing homes, so we can let patients know they are not alone
7. Attending the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Toronto, Canada to meet with qualified scientists and professionals from all over the world
We have all mourned for those who can no longer recall their greatest memories after the onset of this disease as well as the caregivers who devote so much time and effort to look after them. One of our teammates, Anjana, has lost her grandfather to this devastating illness and we hope to honor him and all other Alzheimer's patients as we embark on a journey to truly understand what Alzheimer's is.

</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have been working on this project for over five years now, and I am all heart about it. This is because at times it seem the future of an African child is completely hopeless despite the potentials in them. I once told an American lady who introduced me in teaching, and to whom I pay homage to for my success that, ""<b>It is better to teach individuals how to catch a fish than feeding them with fish whenever they feel hungry</b>"". I believe that Africans in general only needs to be guided in other to make a change in their life.</p>
<p>Everyone who will contribute in this campaign will be helping the African to view life in a complete different perspective. By viewing images in books that directly relate to their personalities and environments. This action will help build up our learners interest in reading, and improve their self-esteem. I believe that reading alone can help build a 60% of a child intellectual abilities, and that some learners will acquire 70% of their knowledge just by reading in books. Good teachers may be unavailable for all learners, but goods books has no fix destination. More again, I know no matter how great a teacher is, without books his/her learners cannot academically achieve to their optimum.   </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Having books is one thing, but knowing how to use them is another.  Most local schools are do not have libraries, and their teachers might find it difficult to use them properly. This is going to be one of our big challenge with this project, because most often skeptical about changes about the changes that can occur in their life.  </p>
<p>However, we will provide training workshops to teacher on how to carried out  guided readings, shared reading, and reading aloud. We are going to freely offer this workshops to the one hundred schools that will be selected to receive a copy of each of our first 100 books printed. These schools will be used as a lab to test the effectiveness of our projects, and also quoted as examples to convinced others to join our program. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Money is important for such a project, but it is not the only way to support it. You can help just by reading our books and by sharing with us your opinions and ideas on them will greatly help to improve our work. Therefore, away from financially contributing, you can also become a godfather or a mentor to this projects and help us to grow.  We are also selling our books on <a href=""http://www.blurb.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.blurb.com</a>, and you can follow us on our Facebook page:<b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/myhome82/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/myhome82/</a></b></p>

I have been working on this project for over five years now, and I am all heart about it. This is because at times it seem the future of an African child is completely hopeless despite the potentials in them. I once told an American lady who introduced me in teaching, and to whom I pay homage to for my success that, ""It is better to teach individuals how to catch a fish than feeding them with fish whenever they feel hungry"". I believe that Africans in general only needs to be guided in other to make a change in their life.
Everyone who will contribute in this campaign will be helping the African to view life in a complete different perspective. By viewing images in books that directly relate to their personalities and environments. This action will help build up our learners interest in reading, and improve their self-esteem. I believe that reading alone can help build a 60% of a child intellectual abilities, and that some learners will acquire 70% of their knowledge just by reading in books. Good teachers may be unavailable for all learners, but goods books has no fix destination. More again, I know no matter how great a teacher is, without books his/her learners cannot academically achieve to their optimum.      Risks & Challenges  Having books is one thing, but knowing how to use them is another.  Most local schools are do not have libraries, and their teachers might find it difficult to use them properly. This is going to be one of our big challenge with this project, because most often skeptical about changes about the changes that can occur in their life.  
However, we will provide training workshops to teacher on how to carried out  guided readings, shared reading, and reading aloud. We are going to freely offer this workshops to the one hundred schools that will be selected to receive a copy of each of our first 100 books printed. These schools will be used as a lab to test the effectiveness of our projects, and also quoted as examples to convinced others to join our program.    Other Ways You Can Help Money is important for such a project, but it is not the only way to support it. You can help just by reading our books and by sharing with us your opinions and ideas on them will greatly help to improve our work. Therefore, away from financially contributing, you can also become a godfather or a mentor to this projects and help us to grow.  We are also selling our books on www.blurb.com, and you can follow us on our Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/myhome82/
Indiegogo also provide a means to help move the campaign to others networks just by using its share tools.

an impact we can have on each other. He wrote us a letter after the conference
was over and spoke about how this conference <b>changed his life</b>, he talked about

The majority of York university’s students are from a<b> lower socioeconomic
status</b> and are already burdened with overwhelming OSAP loans. Despite York
students being interested and excited when we tell them about Ascend, they are
often discouraged after hearing the price. <b>Students who cannot afford to go are
often the students who need it the most</b>, and having funding to subsidize the
cost for delegates would <b>mean more students getting the opportunity to learn

Clothing (All members will receive an ASCEND
T-Shirt. Members will have the opportunity to get it signed by fellow members!) $1164


Speaker fees (We will be having 3 guest speakers throughout
the conference) $300


Leadership Manual (A book containing our curriculum that you
get to keep as a learning tool) $350


Supplies/Website Development (Materials required for running sessions
throughout the conference) $550


Miscellaneous fees (A small amount of the cost is
reserved for emergency situations and overhead costs) $500

Banking Fees $150
Total Costs = $25, 086



Ascend is a not for profit initiative. The full cost of the delegate package will go into Delegates' experience. Should we receive sponsorship, and prices become lower, we will either use the money towards enhancing the Delegate experience, or we will refund EVERYONE the difference. We have already received $2240 in confirmed sponsorships and funding from Faculty leaders to help subsidize the cost of the conference for Delegates who would otherwise not be able to afford it. Although this is a non profit initiative and all costs associated with it go straight to the conference expenses, it is still a hefty price tag for Delegates at $220.  Mentors, coordinators and execs pay a lesser $100 cost because of the amount of work they put in prior to the conference in terms of training and preparation, but regardless, 47 student leaders have pitched in to make Ascend happen. 


The majority of York university’s students are from a lower socioeconomic
status and are already burdened with overwhelming OSAP loans. Despite York
students being interested and excited when we tell them about Ascend, they are
often discouraged after hearing the price. Students who cannot afford to go are
often the students who need it the most, and having funding to subsidize the
cost for delegates would mean more students getting the opportunity to learn
leadership skills, network meaningfully and be inspired to make a difference in
our community.

With every donation, we outline both the impact AND the perk to the Donor. Our goal of $22,000 would cover the cost of using Indiegogo and significantly cover the cost of the Conference so that Delegates only have to pay ~$25. Even if we do not reach our goal, every dollar raised will go towards subsidizing the cost for our Delegates. Your donation translates into a an opportunity for a student to learn and grow. With your help today, we can shape the leaders of tomorrow.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>I am Abiha Batool, a third year student of Communication and Design at Habib University in Karachi. My interests include photography, illustration, storytelling and environmentalism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Attending Habib on a scholarship has been a great opportunity for me because of how it has helped me grow academically and as a person, and I make the most of it by actively participating in extracurriculars like debates, competitions, event management, even representing Habib in COP in My City –a conference - organized by the Ministry of Climate Change. An active participant in student politics, I was also the elected Senator for C&amp;D Class of 2019. I have worked with various departments like the Library, Marketing, Runway Radio and Playground, and was also selected as the orientation leader for the batch of 2020. My experience outside Habib includes interning with organizations like Marvi Mazhar Associates and Express Tribune. I participated in all these activities to earn new skills and experiences, all the while maintaining my CGPA of above 3.5.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a rigorous selection process that not only judged students based on their academic standing but also evaluated their meta-curricular activities and soft skills, I have been selected to represent Pakistan at the Summer International Honors Program (IHP) 2018 at Stanford University, which is one of the finest and top ranked educational institutions in the world. IHP combines top-notch academics with extracurricular activities that explore the rich cultural, social, and geographical resources of the San Francisco Bay Area, and the session's <a href=""https://summer.stanford.edu/program/intensive-studies"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Intensive Studies</a> Program offers students the opportunity to join a cohort of students and faculty and engage deeply with each other. Habib University is the only university in Pakistan that has an MOU signed with Stanford for the IHP Program, which means that the best students are picked for this program as they represent not just Habib, but also Pakistan at Stanford University.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stanford appeals to me mainly because it has one of the most sustainable campuses in the USA. As a staunch advocate of sustainability, I have been working hard at Habib University to make it environment friendly. Along with working on installing a waste management system, I have been working on initiating a Sustainability Office at Habib to make our community more aware and responsible for the waste we create. I also intend to take my interests further and become an Urban Designer to combat the issues of climate change and waste management in Pakistan. Stanford caters to my interests as I will get a chance to take courses like <i>Sustainability Design Thinking  </i>which teach and promote an eco-friendly lifestyle by approaching sustainability from the perspective of design thinking. Along with this I would get a chance to work closely with their Sustainability Office and student-led clubs like <i>Students For Sustainable Stanford,</i> which will help me learn a lot about the theory and implementation of sustainable ideas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moreover, studying at a campus as diverse as Stanford will allow me to grow personally, professionally, intellectually and socially, and its contrast with my own culture and atmosphere will not only help me explore myself, but also become better at relating and collaborating with people from around the world. These connections and learnings will prove to be beneficial for me and my whole community as I will bring them back to Pakistan and implement them in every aspect of my life, including my university and the Society of Sustainability that I initiated and currently Chair. Not only this, my learnings at both Habib and Stanford will allow me to better understand the issues of climate change and sustainability in Pakistan, and will enable me to come up with efficient and valid solutions for our country. I can say that at Habib I have managed to achieve things I didn’t know I was capable of, and Stanford would push me to do even better.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The cost of attending this Program is USD 16,167, and the cost breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Subsidized tuition Fee:  $6,970</li>
<li>Housing and meal plan:  $3,718</li>
<li>Campus health service fee:  $210</li>
<li>Document fee:  $125</li>
<li>I-20 fee:  $150</li>
<li>Room and Board Fee:  $142</li>
<li>Health Insurance:  $1,242</li>
<li>Books and Supplies (estimated):  $450</li>
<li>Round Trip Karachi-Us Airfare (estimated):  $1,300</li>
<li>F1 visa fee + SEVIS fee:  $260</li>
<li>Personal expenses:  $1,500</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total Program Cost:</strong>  <strong>$16,167</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Based on my excellent performance, I was the first student from my major to be granted a 50% scholarship (excluding personal expenses). But even with this scholarship, I have to raise around USD 9,000 by April 2018. I feel that this program is the perfect opportunity for me to learn about a field I am passionate about. Unfortunately I am unable to afford the expenses myself. Previously I was selected for opportunities like UC Berkeley’s Summer Program and The Twelfth International Conference on Design Principles and Practices, but I couldn’t attend them because of the lack of funds. I have worked even harder to get into Stanford University and don’t want this opportunity to go to waste like the last ones. Hence I will be grateful if you would agree to fully or partially sponsor me for Stanford’s Summer Session, or would provide me with any sort of guidance and advice regarding the process. Your smallest contributions can make the greatest difference, so feel free to contribute anything and in any way possible.</p>

<h3>""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."" - Nelson Mandela </h3>
<p>Hello Backers: My name is Tamar Huggins and I am the Founder and Executive Director of Tech Spark - Canada's first tech and design school committed to empowering girls and children of colour, through innovative programs. I am an award-winning tech entrepreneur, author, and speaker with a passion for helping others reach their <i>fullest</i> potential. </p>
<p>In 2012, Tech Spark was just an idea. The idea came to me while I worked with tech startups through an incubator I created for underrepresented founders. The goal was always to increase the representation of women and people of colour as creators in tech, however, I realized that in order to achieve this, the focus must be placed on children. </p>
<p>In 2015, Tech Spark opened its doors and since then we have educated over 500 students living in underserved communities within the Greater Toronto Area.  Our organization's purpose has become even more clear and our impact on each student's life has become more evident. We want to see a proportional representation of women and people of colour in tech creation and innovation in Canada. Our goal is to transform the lives of girls and children of colour through culturally relevant, equitable and innovative tech education.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Problem We Aim to Solve</h3>
<p>Women represent the majority of young university graduates but are still underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and computer science (STEM) fields. Women only make up 23% of STEM graduates and black women make up a paltry 2.9% *Stats Canada 2015.</p>
<p>While jobs in STEM-related industries are growing three times faster than other parts of the economy and paying 12% higher, these jobs employ less than 25% of women. New reports are finding women are still disproportionately hired into their companies' lower-paying technical roles, rather than professional roles. </p>
<p>Statistically, girls and black children tend to avoid or drop out math-intensive STEM paths due to math anxiety, gender and racial stereotypes. Many STEM intervention camps based in the Greater Toronto Area are financially or physically inaccessible to children living in underserved communities and they do not actively target underrepresented groups, such as young girls of colour. These challenges have caused a major pipeline breakdown from education to careers in STEM.</p>
<p>The economic success of this country depends on proper preparation and access to opportunities for all children. Diversity drives innovation - and we simply can not afford to leave anyone behind.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Tech Spark Summer of INNOVATION</h3>
<p>We want to teach 100 students how to create 100 innovative tech projects this Summer. Students will learn how to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build and fly their own drones</li>
<li>Create mobile apps</li>
<li>Create a virtual chatbot</li>
<li>Build a multi-page website</li>
<li>Create a 2D game </li>
<li>Compose music and build movable contraptions through VR </li>
</ol>
<p>As a backer, your support means providing an opportunity to children from underserved neighbourhoods to become today's creators and innovators. All they need is that spark so that they can change the world in which they live. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Your Support Means to This Campaign</h3>
<p>We are asking for $50,000 for the Summer of INNOVATION campaign.  Your support will allow us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invest in equipment that can be reused for future programs (Purchase drone hardware and 10 laptops)</li>
<li>Cover the cost to sponsor each child for 6 weeks of Summer camp (full day, 5 days/week)</li>
<li>Provide honourariums and cover travel expenses for each of our educators and technical mentors </li>
<li>Cover the cost of class materials</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>As a thank you</h3>
<p>We have some pretty amazing and useful perks for all our backers, whether you are supporting us as an individual or a company. Your support means EVERYTHING to our children.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help this campaign go viral! Share on social media, write an article or tell someone at your company. Each time you share our message, you help bring visibility to this very important issue and encourage others to get involved.</p>

In 2015, Tech Spark opened its doors and since then we have educated over 500 students living in underserved communities within the Greater Toronto Area.  Our organization's purpose has become even more clear and our impact on each student's life has become more evident. We want to see a proportional representation of women and people of colour in tech creation and innovation in Canada. Our goal is to transform the lives of girls and children of colour through culturally relevant, equitable and innovative tech education.
 
The Problem We Aim to Solve
Women represent the majority of young university graduates but are still underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and computer science (STEM) fields. Women only make up 23% of STEM graduates and black women make up a paltry 2.9% *Stats Canada 2015.
While jobs in STEM-related industries are growing three times faster than other parts of the economy and paying 12% higher, these jobs employ less than 25% of women. New reports are finding women are still disproportionately hired into their companies' lower-paying technical roles, rather than professional roles. 
Statistically, girls and black children tend to avoid or drop out math-intensive STEM paths due to math anxiety, gender and racial stereotypes. Many STEM intervention camps based in the Greater Toronto Area are financially or physically inaccessible to children living in underserved communities and they do not actively target underrepresented groups, such as young girls of colour. These challenges have caused a major pipeline breakdown from education to careers in STEM.
The economic success of this country depends on proper preparation and access to opportunities for all children. Diversity drives innovation - and we simply can not afford to leave anyone behind.
 
Tech Spark Summer of INNOVATION
We want to teach 100 students how to create 100 innovative tech projects this Summer. Students will learn how to:

Build and fly their own drones
Create mobile apps
Create a virtual chatbot
Build a multi-page website
Create a 2D game 
Compose music and build movable contraptions through VR 

As a backer, your support means providing an opportunity to children from underserved neighbourhoods to become today's creators and innovators. All they need is that spark so that they can change the world in which they live. 
 

What Your Support Means to This Campaign
We are asking for $50,000 for the Summer of INNOVATION campaign.  Your support will allow us to:

Invest in equipment that can be reused for future programs (Purchase drone hardware and 10 laptops)
Cover the cost to sponsor each child for 6 weeks of Summer camp (full day, 5 days/week)
Provide honourariums and cover travel expenses for each of our educators and technical mentors 
Cover the cost of class materials

 
As a thank you
We have some pretty amazing and useful perks for all our backers, whether you are supporting us as an individual or a company. Your support means EVERYTHING to our children.

<p>International Development Youth
Forum (IDYF) is one of the world’s most famous youth conference in the field of
development. Following the needs of future-oriented discussion in this field
and more active participation of youth, IDYF was founded in 2013 to enable
outstanding youth around the world to shape the tomorrow of international
development.</p>
<p>Last year, we received
approximately 5,000 applications from about 170 countries and regions and the
selected youth learned, discussed, and proposed their “win-win” solutions for
the issue of hunger (Last year’s report: <a href=""https://goo.gl/w5lq1Z"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://goo.gl/w5lq1Z</a> ).
This year, we changed the contents and selection process of the conference to
make it possible to create innovative solutions based on the first-hand
information from youth on the ground of the developmental issues and solve the
actual issues by utilizing the outcome of the conference. The coming conference
is IDYF 2016 that will take place in Tokyo next March with its theme of
Industrial development VS Environment in developing countries.</p>

<br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>  Even though IDYF, planned and operated
by the students , is a large-scale program, our budget is very limited. In
order to provide a high-quality program, we would like to have your
understanding and cooperation on this matter.</p>

  We strongly believe that the participation of distinguished youth who originally have no choice but to give it up does not have only a positive influence on IDYF, but also on fthe entire field of international development. We
will use the fund received here mostly to give scholarship to participants who
have financial difficulties to attend. We have realized that the percentage of
participants from Africa is low. The economic difficulties on top of that the geographical
distance, which makes airfare very expensive, is thought to be the reason.
Thus, your contribution can help youths to overcome financial difficulties and
help them design their future</div><div>

to know that the popularity of green tea is spreading all around the world. To
contribute to this phenomenon and as a gratitude to your kind contribution, we
have prepared local green tea bags as a perk as well!</span></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>The main purpose of IDYF is to create a better future based
on diversified values and experiences of youth from both developed and
developing countries. We believe this conference will help youth who will be
the future leaders of the world to expand their horizon and build up lifelong
bonds that will become the platform to bring positive change to the future of
international development. </p>
<p>As
you all know, this year is not just another year to pass by. 2015 is the year
when we all will create the universal goals to the sustainable future which
will have enormously huge impacts on the people across the grove. Moreover,
especially for the youth, the next generation, sustainable development goals
are all about our own future. Therefore, we the youth must not be just waiting
for something we will pursue. As the driving force of the world in the future,
we the youth should consider coming and existing developmental issues, discuss
them, and work on them.</p>
<p>Then, a question rises in front of us. It is about what “we
the youth” means. From the perspective that we share in IDYF community, the
answer is clear. Now that the concept of “development” includes universality
and the international development goals is no longer for only developing
countries but for every country on our globe, the words “we the youth” means
not only those in developing countries nor those in only developed countries.
It must be any youth from any corner of the world. Consequently, IDYF strongly
believe it is the demand of this era to create the framework through which
various youth who are actively working in the field of development around the
world will be able to cooperate with each other and take their actions together
for their common future. We are sure that IDYF will carry out this, because
IDYF is the platform of the youth, by the youth, for the youth and the future.
Moreover, this is because IDYF are with you, the persons who have greatly
supported IDYF in various ways, and former participants around the world. This
is also the very reason why IDYF is able to have its unlimited potential to
create irreplaceable value for the world today and in the future. With this
belief, we the IDYF 2016 organizers make the biggest step ever in IDYF history
from now on.</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why Do We Think It Is Important</h3> <p> </p>
</div>
<p>(1)
Tomorrow of international development</p>
<p>As the traditional way of
development based on the one-way style and the dominance of public sector is
getting on the verge of failure in numerous cases around the world, we the next
generation has come to recognize that we must put period on them and take
initiative to create brand-new approaches of development. Therefore, we
strongly believe that we need to provide an opportunity for outstanding youth
in this field to work together under diversified environment. In order to seek
for alternatives of one-way development, we have provided the opportunities for
outstanding youth from both developing &amp; developed countries to work
together to shape tomorrow of international development. Moreover, we have
welcomed youth with wide-range of field such as an official of UN OCHA, Medical
Doctors, Business consultants, engineers, bureaucrats, biologists, and etc.
This is because today’s international development is no longer a mere economic issue.
To shape tomorrow of international development, various actors with various
knowledge need to work together, which have been materialized in IDYF.</p>
<p>(2)
Innovative solution based on prudent analysis on the ground</p>
<p>Moreover, from this year, we
have been trying to overcome a big challenge for every youth conference, which
is that the discussion at conferences become vague and abstract, that often
results in a situation where their outcome could only work little to address
real problems on the ground. Since outstanding youth from around the world
gather at IDYF, we thought that we must overcome this challenge to fully
utilize their great potential and thus adopted new style of selection, “agenda
setting”. Through this selection, we have selected one youth organization
working on environmental issues and industrial development in Indonesia out of
approximately 1,200 applications from around the world. They will offer IDYF
first-hand information and solve the developmental issues in their area
utilizing the outcome of IDYF.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>We know financial contribution is not
the only contribution you can make. Spreading the word about our project will
be very helpful and we would be very grateful if you could do so. Not only the
potential financial contributors but also youths who are interested in making
change in the world. Chances might be that you are one of them, if so please
apply for our program and hopefully we will meet in Tokyo in March! </p>
<p></p></div>","WHO WE ARE 
International Development Youth
Forum (IDYF) is one of the world’s most famous youth conference in the field of
development. Following the needs of future-oriented discussion in this field
and more active participation of youth, IDYF was founded in 2013 to enable
outstanding youth around the world to shape the tomorrow of international
development.
Last year, we received
approximately 5,000 applications from about 170 countries and regions and the
selected youth learned, discussed, and proposed their “win-win” solutions for
the issue of hunger (Last year’s report: https://goo.gl/w5lq1Z ).
This year, we changed the contents and selection process of the conference to
make it possible to create innovative solutions based on the first-hand
information from youth on the ground of the developmental issues and solve the
actual issues by utilizing the outcome of the conference. The coming conference
is IDYF 2016 that will take place in Tokyo next March with its theme of
Industrial development VS Environment in developing countries.

What We Need & What You Get 
  Even though IDYF, planned and operated
by the students , is a large-scale program, our budget is very limited. In
order to provide a high-quality program, we would like to have your
understanding and cooperation on this matter.

  We strongly believe that the participation of distinguished youth who originally have no choice but to give it up does not have only a positive influence on IDYF, but also on fthe entire field of international development. We
will use the fund received here mostly to give scholarship to participants who
have financial difficulties to attend. We have realized that the percentage of
participants from Africa is low. The economic difficulties on top of that the geographical
distance, which makes airfare very expensive, is thought to be the reason.
Thus, your contribution can help youths to overcome financial difficulties and
help them design their future
IDYF
has set up “IDYF Scholarship” to help distinguished youth with financial
difficulties to take part in its session in Tokyo. 

   In short, we
will use the received funds for the purposes below.
・Scholarships                                                                                                                                       We would like to assist distinguished youth having economic
difficulties with financial supports as travel expenses, participation costs
and such in coming to Japan.
・Operating
expenses                                                                                                                         We
would like to purchase the necessary equipments for holding IDYF. We kindly ask
for your cooperation to set a better environment for enabling the fruitful
discussion.
      We will also submit the report after the session, which shows
the details of where your contribution was used.

           We have perks that is related to
participants and the Japan.  We have
kindly asked each participant to bring a souvenir from their homeland, which
will be used as a gratitude gift to people who have helped us to fund the
conference. Drinking green tea has been a long custom in Japan. It is wonderful
to know that the popularity of green tea is spreading all around the world. To
contribute to this phenomenon and as a gratitude to your kind contribution, we

Why Do We Think It Is Important  

(1)
Tomorrow of international development
As the traditional way of
development based on the one-way style and the dominance of public sector is
getting on the verge of failure in numerous cases around the world, we the next
generation has come to recognize that we must put period on them and take
initiative to create brand-new approaches of development. Therefore, we
