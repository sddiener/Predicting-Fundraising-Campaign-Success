<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>The Native Americans had a term that would confuse us moderns- ""good medicine."" When most of us think of medicine we think of something that helps us recover from being ill but that is not what they meant by it. To them good medicine included any gift or practice that granted them a greater depth of life. But that medicine was about more than health, it was also personal. Finding your medicine was an obligation to find your unique path but there was a community you could rely upon to help you uncover the strength you needed to walk it; a community you served with that strength once you obtained it.</p>
<p>We have lost those traditions of wisdom that had been passed down one generation to another and with it we have lost a part of ourselves. Many of us modern Americans drift through our days without purpose and just not feeling as well as we think we should. Our hearts tell us that there is more vitality and strength to be had; more life than we currently experience. We try hard following all the standard advice on diet and exercise but just never seem able to get there. I am here to tell you that your heart is not wrong. Just because we have lost the path does not mean the path does not exist. There is a still a home to return to even if we have forgotten it.</p>
<p>There is more health, strength, and life available to you than you know. You are capable of things beyond what you can even imagine, of things that now seem the sole realm of legends. There is freedom to be had that will enable us to dream big again. Because honestly, accomplishing feats that most believe impossible is actually pretty simple once you remember the path to-</p>
<p>Become legendary.</p>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>Two weeks before I left for college I got sick. I lost 20 pounds almost overnight and that was the beginning of almost 7 years of hardship. Looking back now it is almost hard to believe that I spent entire months in bed barely able to function. Those years molded me, they were a gift really. The journey of getting my life back is what set me on the path to becoming who I am today.</p>
<p>I was forced to search and learn the paths of life, not because I wanted to but because if I didn't then I would die. What I discovered still surprises me even though it has been years- there are ancient secrets, that didn't used to be secrets at all, that we have forgotten. As moderns we have pursued our comfort above all else and consequentially we have laid aside these ancient life-ways because they did not serve that goal. Our ancestors remember what we have forgotten- </p>
<p>There is strength and freedom to be found in things that make us uncomfortable. They regularly submitted themselves to training practices which enabled them to accomplish physical feats that seem extraordinary to us today, things we write off as myths. Science is slowly, oh so slowly, realizing the power some of these old traditions had and starting to see that the limits of human potential may not be what we have thought they are. I did not create any of these methods I use, but I may be the first to see the convergence and put them all together.</p>
<p>My discovery and use of these ways is what gave me my life back. Now I use them to train myself for the incredible and help you to do the same.</p>
<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>I have been working on developing these simple methods into protocols then experimenting with them on myself and a handful of my personal training clients. The results I have seen border on the unbelievable and they can sometimes happen fast too. What I will do is take what I have learned and create programs that combine these ancient life-ways with modern exercise and diet systems. Once I have the pieces condensed into easy to follow guides, I can share these reclaimed traditions and how best to use them with everyone. These secrets never should have become secrets and I want to unleash them in the world again! While I didn’t create the components being combined, I may be the first to experience their combined synergy and make them publicly available. It is the synergy of these different pieces that make this system incredible.</p>
<p>The guides to each method will be made available for free on my blog. I will also take the information in the guides and assemble it into pre-packaged programs serving different goals. These I will sell.</p>
<h2>What's The Money For?</h2>
<p>I have all the content needed to create the programs. The funding will be used to:  </p>
<ol>
<li>finish creating the programs and guides</li>
<li>design, debug and launch the online platform</li>
</ol>
<p>I have done a comprehensive analysis of this project and believe it will work given the requested funding.</p>
<h2>Think This Is Hogwash?</h2>
<p>Support me and find out! A short time ago I would have thought this was hogwash too. When I launch the website I am going to go on a publicized adventure to prove it. I haven't chosen the adventure yet; I may even have a backer or social media choose it for me, but it will be something incredible enough to make you believe in the training methods. They really are all quite simple in and of themselves, things you may even have heard of. What I have done is assemble them in a way that creates incredible synergy. I will even give you a hint since the magic is in the execution, not in the knowledge. The main methods that make up my protocols are-</p>
<p>Nutrition protocols grounded in history and science that are pretty opposite of what you have likely been taught, exercise methods that require a lot less time to get a lot bigger results than we have come to expect, intermittent and block fasting schedules, detox cycles, breathing exercises, cold water and sauna therapies, circadian rhythm hacks, and modern supplements that help facilitate the ancient ways.</p>
<p>People have gotten incredible results implementing any one of these techniques, what I am promising is simple ways to put them all together. It’s the level of synergy of this system that makes the word legendary credible. But I am dying to give you something so here is a fore-taste-</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you know that cold exposure can cause fat loss not just through the calorie burn of staying warm but also its impact on leptin sensitivity, and that this can even mitigate the cycles of weight regain?</li>
<li>Did you know that breathing exercises can be used to manage food cravings through their affect on blood PH?</li>
<li>Did you know that your amount of heat producing brown adipose tissue that your body maintains is strongly affected by hypoxia and can be hacked by breathing exercises thus causing you to stay warm all the time?</li>
<li>Did you know that through the Bohr Effect the amount of oxygen your cells can absorb out of your blood stream is actually dependent upon how much carbon dioxide is in your blood, thus training your body to tolerate a higher level of carbon dioxide can cause you to have more endurance through more efficient use of oxygen without having to exercise at all?</li>
<li>Did you know that fasting causes a greater rise in growth hormone in response to training as well as increasing the amount catecholamines that your body releases thus fueling an intenser workout?</li>
<li>Did you know that fasting can cause you to be more tan irregardless of sun exposure and also increase your body’s creation of heat producing brown adipose tissue, thus making you more tolerant of all outdoor extremes?</li>
<li>Did you know that fasting trains your body to burn fat more effectively as a fuel and to preserve its glycogen stores thus helping you to both stay lean and to function at a high level level for extended periods of time without food?</li>
<li>Did you know that fasting helps your body heal through autophagy and that the lower levels of blood sugar decreases inflammation thus helping to speed up recovery from physical stress of every kind?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only some of the smaller and simpler pieces that will be included in my guides and programs. If you think some of that information is huge imagine what happens when you put it all together! We spend so much time in modern health and fitness fighting against how our bodies were designed to work. It is amazing what can happen when we return to collaborating with their normal function instead.</p>
<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>The main risks and challenges that I can foresee and my respective strategies are- </p>
<p><strong>1 Building the online platform. </strong></p>
<p>There are always unexpected problems in building platforms but technically the platform is not complex and can function with generic audio visual and commerce features. Outsourcing will be used for any technical issues outside my experience. Fortunately I’ve been able to heavily leverage my uncle who is the founder of Morgan James Publishing, who’s an expert in online marketing and social media. His help has been, and will continue to be, massively important for the success of this project.</p>
<p><strong>2 Publicizing the message.</strong></p>
<p>The marketing effort to pull traffic into the web platform is likely the biggest risk. I have done a comprehensive forecast of what advertising will cost for sharing the initial launch on social media in order to hit critical mass and it all fits within my budget. This predicament is what originally brought me to crowdfunding as it allows me to generate buzz and interest in the message while I am preparing for it to launch.</p>
<p><strong>3 Communicating the message.</strong></p>
<p>All new and revolutionary ideas are always accompanied by a difficulty in explaining them. Fresh ideas by their very nature come from fresh perspectives and it always takes some effort to get people to look at a common problem from a different point of view. I am anticipating the sharing of the message being a fun challenge during this venture. The programs and guides are very simple to look at but the repercussions of the value they create are massive and really hard to put to words. You almost have to feel it to understand and believe it. My solution to this is leveraging creative story telling as a means to convey the heart of the message and the value of it. Then to go out and live it to create excitement over what is possible. The more people who try it and thrive, the better we all will get at sharing it together with the world.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the funding set on flexible?</strong></p>
<p>I have funding set to flexible because this project is going to be funded, even if it is out of my own pocket. Any money raised on Indiegogo will help offset my expenses, so you are assured of your rewards regardless of the amount raised! I truly feel like I have been given a gift and am incredibly grateful for it. I’m 100% committed to making this gift available to you too!</p>

<h3>World Chase Tag - a brief history</h3>
<p>World Chase Tag was formed by brothers Christian and Damien Devaux after a game of tag with Christian's son, Orlando, in their garden. Four years (and two events) later, their footage has received more than 120 million views online and been aired on TV channels around the world (including ESPN, Fox, BBC, Fuji TV, TMZ, CBS and many more). Their tournaments have been contested by some of the biggest names in Parkour (including Storror, Sebastien Foucan and Danny Ilabaca) and they have built an online following of more than 120,000 suscribers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Basically, we went from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFNKcQGrsC8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a>, to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSoGbaMCTjs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our third event is fast approaching, and we are at a crucial turning point. If we can make WCT3 as spectacular as we believe it could be, it will demonstrate to sponsors, networks and investors that our exciting new take on one of the oldest games has huge potential for growth. This will bring us one step closer to realising our long-term goal of creating a global, professional sport, with Chase Tag facilities around the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Indiegogo Campaign</h3>
<p>The production costs for hosting WCT3 will be around $80,000. This will include venue hire, court transportation, insurance, crew wages, lighting, providing a live-feed and a host of other expenses. We will pay for this through sponsorship, and any shortfall will be covered by private backers. However, to create the best action, we want to invite the best athletes from around the world - with teams from Europe, America, Asia and Africa. And this is where we need your support. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>We would like to raise $40,000 to help cover prize money and athlete transport and accommodation. 100% of the money raised (minus 35% costs for material, packaging post etc.) will go to the athletes and World Chase Tag will receive none of it. $10,000 will be allocated to prize money and the remaining $30,000 will help with athlete transport and accommodation.</p>
<p>There will be eight teams in total at WCT3 and each team has up to five athletes. The teams that travel further will be given a larger budget. We will finalise the team selection in mid August and it is at this point we will decide how much each team will receive (i.e. depending on where they have to travel from). </p>
<p>If we are able to surpass this $40,000 goal, the additional funds raised will go towards creating a superior live-feed, which would include the use of  additional cameras, live action replays and so on. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>In return for your support, we will be offering a number of perks that are available exclusively through our Indiegogo campaign. These include a selection of T-shirts, the WCT winner’s medal and pieces of the actual WCT3 match court. Regardless of how much you are able to invest, you’ll still be able to watch the event for free on our Twitch live feed. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>Our plan for 2019 is to host a four event world series. We will have three qualifying events, in Europe, Asia and America, and the winning teams from each event will go through to the World Final (location TBC). The success of WCT3 will play a big part in making this happen, so your support is very much appreciated!! </p>

World Chase Tag was formed by brothers Christian and Damien Devaux after a game of tag with Christian's son, Orlando, in their garden. Four years (and two events) later, their footage has received more than 120 million views online and been aired on TV channels around the world (including ESPN, Fox, BBC, Fuji TV, TMZ, CBS and many more). Their tournaments have been contested by some of the biggest names in Parkour (including Storror, Sebastien Foucan and Danny Ilabaca) and they have built an online following of more than 120,000 suscribers. 
 
Basically, we went from this, to this.
 
Our third event is fast approaching, and we are at a crucial turning point. If we can make WCT3 as spectacular as we believe it could be, it will demonstrate to sponsors, networks and investors that our exciting new take on one of the oldest games has huge potential for growth. This will bring us one step closer to realising our long-term goal of creating a global, professional sport, with Chase Tag facilities around the world. 
 
Our Indiegogo Campaign
The production costs for hosting WCT3 will be around $80,000. This will include venue hire, court transportation, insurance, crew wages, lighting, providing a live-feed and a host of other expenses. We will pay for this through sponsorship, and any shortfall will be covered by private backers. However, to create the best action, we want to invite the best athletes from around the world - with teams from Europe, America, Asia and Africa. And this is where we need your support. 
 
Our Goal
We would like to raise $40,000 to help cover prize money and athlete transport and accommodation. 100% of the money raised (minus 35% costs for material, packaging post etc.) will go to the athletes and World Chase Tag will receive none of it. $10,000 will be allocated to prize money and the remaining $30,000 will help with athlete transport and accommodation.
There will be eight teams in total at WCT3 and each team has up to five athletes. The teams that travel further will be given a larger budget. We will finalise the team selection in mid August and it is at this point we will decide how much each team will receive (i.e. depending on where they have to travel from). 
If we are able to surpass this $40,000 goal, the additional funds raised will go towards creating a superior live-feed, which would include the use of  additional cameras, live action replays and so on. 
 
The Perks
In return for your support, we will be offering a number of perks that are available exclusively through our Indiegogo campaign. These include a selection of T-shirts, the WCT winner’s medal and pieces of the actual WCT3 match court. Regardless of how much you are able to invest, you’ll still be able to watch the event for free on our Twitch live feed. 
 
The Future
Our plan for 2019 is to host a four event world series. We will have three qualifying events, in Europe, Asia and America, and the winning teams from each event will go through to the World Final (location TBC). The success of WCT3 will play a big part in making this happen, so your support is very much appreciated!!

<p>In 2017, I saw a commercial about a veteran returning from Afghanistan with spinal injuries.  He couldn’t stand on his own or walk unaided.  I felt that he had given his all for me, and now it was my turn to do for him.  I discovered that there are over 1,000,000 paraplegics in the U.S. due to traffic accidents, spinal injuries, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, and returning veterans. I spent the last year and a half designing and developing the PARA-LIFT in hopes of giving these individuals back their freedom and dignity. </p>
<p>Can you imagine not being able to stand and hug a loved one, or accomplish something as simple as getting a glass of water from the sink, or washing your own dishes, or the loss of dignity one feels from not being able to use the toilet without help? Imagine being in a social or business setting where people are standing and conversing, and instead of being at the seated level, you could stand also and engage at eye level. At the grocery store you could rise up and reach your own items off the shelf instead of having to ask another customer or employee to reach it for you.  Or how about being able to rise to participate in a standing ovation at a concert, or to be able to stand for the National Anthem? These are simple, everyday things that most of us take for granted.</p>
<p>My fiance and I, and our family, have invested everything we have into this project (over $67,000), and now we are asking for help to finish our dream of making it a reality for those that need it most.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The PARA-LIFT is a motorized ambulatory lift designed primarily for paraplegics, however, those with spinal injuries or other mobility disorders can also use it.  It can be driven like a motorized wheelchair, or from a standing position, and is capable of lifting a 300-pound user. </p>
<p>Our goal is to provide a durable and stable ambulatory lift to help users to regain their independence and dignity. </p>
<p>Competitive products that perform similar functions are priced at over $30,000 and are heavier and wider than the PARA-LIFT and are less maneuverable.  The lift capacity of the PARA-LIFT is unsurpassed in the industry and yet the weight of the PARA-LIFT is just 68 pounds. </p>
<p>We have purchased most of the machining equipment we need to start production however we still need several key pieces of equipment. Contributions will be used to acquire a CNC milling machine, tooling, product materials, shipping containers and labor to manufacture, assemble, and deliver our product to those who need them. </p>
<p>While contributions of any amount toward this effort are greatly appreciated, all contributions of $100 will go into a fund to provide PARA-LIFT units for our disabled American Veterans.</p>
<p>Help us reach our goal to provide those in need with the benefits that the PARA-LIFT will provide.</p>

<h3>Mush - A social app for mushing.</h3>
<p>There are a handful of mushing apps on the market, but none that will be able to compete with what Mush has to offer! By combining the social aspect into a route and dog stat tracking app, we're creating a platform not only for your personal stats, but for your friends and teammates stats as well. You'll be able to view others routes/speeds/times, dog line up and individual dog stats, as well as their overall stats such as total mileage and top speeds and times! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where we're at.</h3>
<p>Right now Mush is still in the concept phase, and while most of the details and features are finalized, we're still looking for input from you the user. If you have an idea for a feature, or a suggestion to expand on a current feature, we'd love to hear from you. Currently the plan is to release an Android version, and shortly after the Android version is launched, we'll work on releasing a version for iOS.</p>
<p>Along with the Android release, a web version will be available that will have the same features as the mobile app minus the GPS tracking. It will allow you to setup your dogs, add and view friends posts and routes/dogs, share your or your dog's profile pages to various social media sites, and more.

There are a handful of mushing apps on the market, but none that will be able to compete with what Mush has to offer! By combining the social aspect into a route and dog stat tracking app, we're creating a platform not only for your personal stats, but for your friends and teammates stats as well. You'll be able to view others routes/speeds/times, dog line up and individual dog stats, as well as their overall stats such as total mileage and top speeds and times! 

Where we're at.
Right now Mush is still in the concept phase, and while most of the details and features are finalized, we're still looking for input from you the user. If you have an idea for a feature, or a suggestion to expand on a current feature, we'd love to hear from you. Currently the plan is to release an Android version, and shortly after the Android version is launched, we'll work on releasing a version for iOS.
Along with the Android release, a web version will be available that will have the same features as the mobile app minus the GPS tracking. It will allow you to setup your dogs, add and view friends posts and routes/dogs, share your or your dog's profile pages to various social media sites, and more. We're also implementing both a rank and badge system to help you meet your personal or team goals, and to allow users to view the top ranking users/teams on the site ( you can opt out of having your stats publicly displayed).
Every donation goes toward the development of the app and costs associated with hosting and distribution fees on the app stores, and expanding the list of features post launch.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi Future Contributor! We are asking for a little help from our friends!</p>
<p>We were hesitant about crowd-raising capital at first, but then we realized how cool this concept actually is. This approach levels the playing field for small businesses, and allows a community to come together to create positive change.</p>
<p>A little background: Fusion was founded in 2017 by an Registered Nurse who wanted to create a healthy alternative to the normal Fast Food Options while still being able to impact the health and wellness of the community. The concepts focus was to be different from other Smoothie and Juice Bars. No Ice, No Sugar, No Purees! Fresh and Frozen Fruit and Vegetables. Natural sweeteners Honey and Agave ONLY!</p>
<p>After being open for now 2 years we now have a desire to do MORE! We have slowly started to incorporate herbs and would like to take it up a notch. We truly believe in using natures own goodness to heal and strengthen ourselves. The goal is to be able to provide a larger array of natural products both directly from the store and online!</p>
<p>The plan is to offer all things that facilitate whole health; Balance of the Mind, Body, and Spirit. We will be able to provide an atmosphere for our customers to escape the hustle and bustle and relax in an space deigned to rejuvenate your whole body's health and wellness.</p>
<p>Contributions received will go towards: </p>
<ul>
<li>Relocating to a larger building</li>
<li>Renovations to new space</li>
<li>Purchasing new equipment, fixtures, furniture</li>
<li>Purchasing Packaging/Supplies for new products</li>

<li>Education/Training of staff</li>
</ul>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $200K</p>
<p><strong>Relocating to a larger building</strong>: We are currently located in Summerville, SC. Currently Summerville is booming with new business and neighborhoods. There are only a few locations left in the area that would be available for lease and/or purchase. We plan to move quickly on a location as soon as we get enough financial contributions! </p>
<p><strong>Renovations to new space</strong>: Renovations will include designating a main area for our Smoothie Juice and Herb Bar. Allocation of merchandising areas for direct sales of herbs and herbal blends, a spiritual wellness area, a natural hair/skin/body merchandise area, Consultation room for meetings and education forums, separate meditation area. We plan to incorporate other small businesses brand items as well throughout the new space!</p>
<p><strong>Purchasing new equipment, fixtures, furniture</strong>: Merchandiser refrigerators, Cold Press Juicer, Scales, Herbal shelving/Display Wall, Seating for various uses.  </p>
<p><strong>Purchasing Packaging/Supplies for distribution</strong>: Boxes, Bottles, Labels, Containers, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Trademarks</strong>: New Herbal and Product Line</p>
<p><strong>Website redesign</strong>: for e-Commerce: hire web designer </p>
<p><strong>Business Legal Re-structuring</strong>: additional CPA services to ensure new business model/filings are suited best and make needed changes </p>
<p><strong>Initial Inventory for new products</strong>: large supply of herbs, spices, produce, etc for proprietary product blends. </p>
<p><strong>Education/Training</strong>: designate educational time to provide staff hands on training for new distribution plan and setup to ensure efficiency in processing orders. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why are we expanding? Whats the impact?</p>
<p>The Herbal and Supplement Industry in 2018 was said to be a 30.7 Billion dollar market. 2019 is projected to increase to 32 billion. </p>
<p>With consumers interest in health and wellness growing so is the market for supplements that support this lifestyle. Most consumers will tell you the reason why they consume dietary supplements is for overall health and wellness benefits! <br/><br/>Rising health concerns along with changing lifestyles and diets has surged the product demand. With the continued growing consumer awareness the market growth has a favorable outlook. </p>
<p>Since we opened in 2017, Fusion has definitely been a hub for new healthy alternatives in the area. We have been listed in online publications, as well we were voted Summerville's BEST Smoothie in 2018.  We have such a great loyal customer base that grows daily and challenges us to do more. We are constantly being asked are we going to opening another location, can we extend our hours, when are we going to add a new product etc. But all these things take resources, and in particular financial resources. We invest everything back into the day to day business needs. We were able to invest in a truck this year, to be able to reach more areas!</p>
<p>However, expanding our brand and products will allow us to provide even more health and wellness options to the community and abroad. One advantage we have is our customers love knowing us personally and knowing that our products are handcrafted right in the shop. </p>
<p>Being able to provide a more broad selection of whole, fresh natural ingredients and adding to that a new herbal line of products we would be helping more people take better control and responsibility for their own health. We will be able to give more people an opportunity approach whole health by focusing on strengthening the mind body and spirit! </p>

</div><div>
<div>
<p>What most things there are ALWAYS Risk?</p>
<p>If we don't reach out full goal, we will still move forward with Trademarking first. We must secure our intellectual ideas before we can roll out anything new! Expanding within our financial abilities would be our next top priority. We still plan to locate a better suited building that would allow us to be able to process more orders. We will also use all contributions to purchase supplies, inventory and products needed to roll out a our new lines. </p>
<p>So the risk here would only be a time delay in obtaining the overall goal. We will continue to move forward with all listed plans according to priorities and financial ability. </p>

<p></p>
<div>
<p>Hello. My name is Laurane McGlynn. I would like to invite you to participate in making a dream come true. I work as a clinical psychologist who specializes in working with people with chronic illness, chronic pain and cancer. I am also a breast cancer survivor. I remember how challenging it was to try and find resources for holistic healing to supplement the treatment I was receiving with traditional medicine.  </p>
<p>My body, mind and spirit were all impacted by the experience of being diagnosed and treated for cancer. I remember how critical is was for my survival to find healers I could trust and feel safe and supported by.  I was very fortunate to find a massage therapist,  a naturopathic doctor, therapist and many others who significantly contributed to my ability to survive this disease. </p>
<p>For the past 8 years, I have felt a strong calling to open an integrated healing center where I can offer low cost, affordable holistic services to people with physical and mental illness regardless of their diagnosis. I have experienced in a very personal way, how fragile life is. For me, the most important thing is to continue to live my life in a meaningful and purposeful way. Guiding and supporting others toward health and healing is what I feel I am called to do. </p>
<p>While I have been committed to that goal, there has been a lack of financial support.  I have learned to live a very simple lifestyle, so money is not something I have a lot of. I do have motivation and determination and know that I can make this center a reality but I do need some financial support to put a down payment on a property. The property will be located in Bucks County, PA and has multiple treatment rooms along with space for workshops and weekend programs. </p>
<p>Once I have secured the property, I have a team of practitioners who can offer a variety of services including naturopathic medicine, psychotherapy, nutritional consultations, Reiki, breathwork, yoga, massage therapy, art therapy and dance and movement therapies. </p>
<p>Please consider supporting the opening of A Place for Hope and Healing - An Integrated Treatment Center. I deeply appreciate any help you can offer. You can make a difference in the lives of those who are living with cancer and other medical and psychological issues. Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Our Goal</b></p>
<p>The goal of our Garden
Sponsorship Program is to raise $2000 which will enable 10 families within our
community the opportunity to have their very own 15X30 pesticide-free garden
plots for the 2015  growing season.  This plot will enable our
sponsored families the opportunity to join others in growing pesticide-free
produce in our community garden. Families who are new to growing their own food
will be guided by volunteer mentors to grow their own food from seed to
harvest.  To date, our program has allowed us to support many local
families not only gain access to fresh organically grown foods but has provided
them with the knowledge and confidence to grow their own food. </p>
<p><b>Our Outcomes</b></p>
<p>To date, our program with support from people like you,
has allowed us to offer many local families a chance to not only gain access to
fresh naturally  grown foods but has provided them with the knowledge and
confidence to grow their own food. 2013 was the launch of our Garden Plot
Sponsorship program which was made possible through generous  funding
from members in our community and people across the country.  With this
support, over the past 2 years we partnered with Pathways to Prosperity and
other non-profit groups in Sussex County and we have welcomed 12 families and
organizations to join our gardens at no cost to them. </p>
<p>This year we hope to expand our Garden Sponsorship Program encouraging more families and volunteer groups to grow their own food.</p>

Sponsorship Program  <br/>
 “Having  the plot is beneficial to us in many ways. Thank you for
your kindness”- Sunset Vista Community Gardner, Plot Sponsorship Program</i></p>
<p><b>The Problem</b></p>
<p>The USDA reports that more than 1 in 5 children in the
U.S. are living in a food-insecure home or a home where the members are
consistently unable to access an adequate amount of nutritious food necessary
for a healthy life.  A key cause of food-insecurity in the U.S. is the
lack of sufficient resources to cover the cost of food in addition to meeting
their basic needs.</p>
<p>Throughout Sussex County, New Jersey, there are families
who do not have enough to eat. Often families in need consume food based on calories
and not on the healthiest choice.  Many rely on local food pantries for
support; however, hunger continues to be a daily part of life for these
families.</p>
<p><b>A Solution  </b></p>
<p>At Sunset Vista Community Garden &amp; Learning Center
there is an additional resource for these families to obtain a daily source of
nutritional healthy food.  Gardening provides access to produce and
nutritionally rich foods that may otherwise be unavailable to low-income
families and individuals.</p>
<p>Working together as a community on behalf of our
neighbors in need we can give the gift of healthy food through our Garden Plot
Sponsorship Program.</p>
<p>With as little as $5 you can help sponsor a 15 x 30 
pesticide-free garden plot to help food-insecure families from Sussex County
supplement their diets with healthy pesticide-free produce they grow
themselves.  With the average plot producing over 225 pounds of fresh
produce, these families can have a reliable source of nutritional food. In
addition, families will work alongside other community gardeners to learn how
to produce their own food for a life long impact.</p>
<p>Working in conjunction with local food pantries, families
producing more than they can use will be encouraged to give back to their local
food pantries in an effort to help other food-insecure families meet their
nutritional dietary needs.</p>

After having 7 children, 20 grandchildren, and 9 great grandchildren, they built a family I am proud to be a member of. After 66 years of marriage, WW2, the trials of raising 7 kids, cancer, a coma, and far more, their love for each other never faltered. In January of 2015, in the  middle of the night, my grandfather died. The only thing I can say is that it was painless, and faster than falling asleep. Our family struggled with the loss of this great man, but none so much as his wife of 66 years.</p>
<p>Aside from my parents and I, the whole family lives in rural Minnesota, a 1200 mile distance from suburban  Maryland, where I call home. When I flew out to be with my family, there was no funeral, no body to say goodbye to, just family; for you see, my grandparents were very givin, and are still, of all they had to share with the world. My grandparents both have it in their will to have their bodies donated to  medical research to further chances of saving lives of others down the road. Throughout their lives, this was the ideal they lived by. The greatest example was something kept a secret until after his death, you see, we found a letter my grandfather had written to the company he retired from; there were big layoffs coming, my grandfather was not going to lose his job, but a young man he was working with was. He offered to begin drawing his pension as long as they agreed to let this young man stay so he could support his family. Being so humble, he never told a soul, he was content knowing he did the right thing.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We all laughed, cried, and shared our fond memories. The day I left,I was finally able to sit in his chair and say goodbye. My mother took the image above of that goodbye. When I gave my grandmother a hug, teary-eyed to say farewell, the last thing she said was  don't forget me. How could I ever forget her? I  can't, but I  also can't let the last time I saw her be a memory of loss as well. Her health is failing, she can't feed herself, walk, or speak very well due to  Parkinson's and other issues, but she can and does love with all her heart. I  need to see her once more. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Please  help me. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need</h3>
<div>I'm a young man, working hard to just get by, I'm comfortable, but don't have a disposable income to speak of. There's no way I could afford to set aside the money for plane tickets, a car rental, and lodging before most of this year is gone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Even partial funding would make a world of difference, just to see her once more. </div> </div> <div> <h3>Impact </h3>
<div>I know that I have been long winded already. However, as much as it pains me to say, the last time I saw my grandfather, it wasn't easy.

We never spoke again after that, and now I never have the chance to. Please, I have already had one painful goodbyes. I  can't let this one be tainted by sorrow too.</div>

Over the past few weeks, the situation worsened dramatically when the first case of Ebola Virus was identified in Kono District of Sierra Leone--just miles from the clinic where UCSF researchers have provided public health programs and care for patients for several years. Ebola is now in nearly every district of Sierra Leone and much of the public healthcare system is in panic after the tragic death of Sierra Leone's top Ebola physician, Dr. Sheik Umar Khan.</span><br/></p>
<p>Your support will help us continue to implement our response plan to treat and prevent the spread of ebola among this vulnerable population<strong>. </strong>This includes:</p>
<p>  *  Operating a nationwide distribution network for emergency medications and supplies from our international partners</p>
<p>  *  Supporting the Ebola isolation and referral center at Kono's Public Hospital</p>
<p>  *    Implementing strict screening and control measures at our facility in Sierra Leone</p>

</div></div>","The Ebola Home Health Kit 

When the Ebola epidemic began to spread, many of us wanted to help, but didn't know how best to do it. The epidemic is not over! 
The Ebola Home Health Kit as created and distributed by Dr. Dan Kelly and implemented by Shine On Sierra Leone is a way to help stop the spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone as well as support long term health care infrastructure in the country.  


Dr. Dan Kelly, Infectious Disease Specialist and leading authority on the Ebola response examining the contents of the first 20 Home Health Kits (HHK) to be distributed in Kono, Sierra Leone. 



We are still in the midst of the worst Ebola outbreak in history. Over the past few weeks, the situation worsened dramatically when the first case of Ebola Virus was identified in Kono District of Sierra Leone--just miles from the clinic where UCSF researchers have provided public health programs and care for patients for several years. Ebola is now in nearly every district of Sierra Leone and much of the public healthcare system is in panic after the tragic death of Sierra Leone's top Ebola physician, Dr. Sheik Umar Khan.
Your support will help us continue to implement our response plan to treat and prevent the spread of ebola among this vulnerable population. This includes:
  *  Operating a nationwide distribution network for emergency medications and supplies from our international partners
  *  Supporting the Ebola isolation and referral center at Kono's Public Hospital
  *    Implementing strict screening and control measures at our facility in Sierra Leone
  *  Coordinating emergency referrals to Ebola treatment centers in Kailahun District
  *  Collaborating with the District Health Management Team to implement effective contact tracing and sensitive community engagement.
To learn more about Ebola in Sierra Leone and our response efforts, check out our recent media appearances below:
Dr. Kelly's work with Wellbody alliance was featured on the CBS Evening News on September 16.
A recent San Francisco Chronicle article about Dr. Kelly's work in Sierra Leone.

An International Business Times article about President Obama's plan to fight Ebola.
A Huffington Post interview with Wellbody’s Executive Director, revealing the greatest needs on the ground and relates to the fearful reactions of local communities
A NBC interview (video) featuring Dr. Dan Kelly, our Co-Founder and Chief Strategic in which he discusses the fear and distrust in the community and explains why such a reaction has occurred 
An ABC profile on our Executive Director that details his personal motivations and experiences, in addition to his perspective on the Ebola outbreak""
An op-ed by Dan Kelly, MD, on the urgent need to protect West African health care workers from Ebola.
An article in Nature that features our work in Sierra Leone.
Coverage in the Washington Post regarding Dan and Shine On Sierra Leone's work so far.
Gifts will not only help us treat and prevent ebola but will also help us continue to train local villagers to serve as public health workers who can stop the spread of the virus in their own community.

<p>Since 2014 she managed to run her first marathon and three halves, and that’s not her last word yet.  When not running, you can find her reading about her several areas of interest. Especially keen on sports nutrition, Emilia stands behind Runner’s Delight’s research and development. She also loves writing, both in her day-job as a translator and on her blog (<a href=""http://runnersdelightblog.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://runnersdelightblog.blogspot.com/</a>), travelling and experimenting with her own recipes. She has a lot of goals and is determined to make them happen. Runner’s Delight is one of them.</p>
<p>Adam</p>
<p>Although he has worked in many branches of industry, ranging from banking to the marketing departments of big companies, he gets most satisfaction from working on his own projects. In his free time, you can find Adam reading or in his DIY-land refurbishing old bikes or creating pretty things out of scrap wood. Or working hard on the graphic design and web-development end of Runner’s Delight so that we can deliver super-porridge to your door as soon as possible. Adam also enjoys good music and can play you Comptine d'un autre été on the piano.</p>
<br/>About the project<br/>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why porridge?</h3>
<br/><p><b>Porridge is a perfect energy source for runners.</b></p>
<br/><p> It’s rich in complex carbs and has a moderate glycemic index (GI = 58), which makes it a sustainable energy source, releasing energy over a longer period of time. Moreover, it’s a great source of soluble fibre 0- beta glucan - which can help prevent cardiovascular diseases and manage weight. You can eat it both savoury and sweet, and there are endless exciting options. Porridge is pure goodness :) </p>
<br/><p><b>Humble beginnings…</b></p>

<br/><p><b>The idea popped into Emilia’s head in the summer of 2014 when she was preparing for her first marathon with her runner-roomies.</b></p>
<p>For the next few months we have worked hard to <b>identify the core needs of endurance athletes,</b> the most frequent running niggles and which natural nutrients could help to combat them. We have developed ninedeliciousflavours,each serving a different function. The 9 supplement mixes we are going to add to our porridge will help you towards achieving your<b> different running-health goals:</b></p>

Runner's Delight is the first fortified instant porridge designed by runners for runners.



We are fundraising to kickstart production of the first batch - and porridge is not our last word! Make this breakfast of champions happen!
Runner’s Delight addresses your special needs to make you a stronger, healthier and happier runner!







 Each of the 9 flavours was enriched with a specially designed combination of vitamins, minerals, natural enzymes and antioxidants  (carry on reading for more details!) serving a specific function for optimal health and performance of the runner and helping to combat the most frequent running niggles







About us 






Emilia
Since 2014 she managed to run her first marathon and three halves, and that’s not her last word yet.  When not running, you can find her reading about her several areas of interest. Especially keen on sports nutrition, Emilia stands behind Runner’s Delight’s research and development. She also loves writing, both in her day-job as a translator and on her blog (http://runnersdelightblog.blogspot.com/), travelling and experimenting with her own recipes. She has a lot of goals and is determined to make them happen. Runner’s Delight is one of them.
Adam
Although he has worked in many branches of industry, ranging from banking to the marketing departments of big companies, he gets most satisfaction from working on his own projects. In his free time, you can find Adam reading or in his DIY-land refurbishing old bikes or creating pretty things out of scrap wood. Or working hard on the graphic design and web-development end of Runner’s Delight so that we can deliver super-porridge to your door as soon as possible. Adam also enjoys good music and can play you Comptine d'un autre été on the piano.
About the project


Why porridge?
Porridge is a perfect energy source for runners.
 It’s rich in complex carbs and has a moderate glycemic index (GI = 58), which makes it a sustainable energy source, releasing energy over a longer period of time. Moreover, it’s a great source of soluble fibre 0- beta glucan - which can help prevent cardiovascular diseases and manage weight. You can eat it both savoury and sweet, and there are endless exciting options. Porridge is pure goodness :) 
Humble beginnings…

The idea popped into Emilia’s head in the summer of 2014 when she was preparing for her first marathon with her runner-roomies.
For the next few months we have worked hard to identify the core needs of endurance athletes, the most frequent running niggles and which natural nutrients could help to combat them. We have developed ninedeliciousflavours,each serving a different function. The 9 supplement mixes we are going to add to our porridge will help you towards achieving your different running-health goals:


optimal start weight (RED)
aiding muscle recovery (GREEN)
combating vitamin deficiencies (WHITE) 
preventing GI distress (BLACK) 
optimal energy (BROWN)
optimal hydration (YELLOW)
optimal endurance (CHERRY)
boosting the immune system (PURPLE) 
fighting inflammation (ORANGE) 



What’s the difference between Runner’s Delight and regular porridge? 
Runner’s Delight’s super-ingredients!



#RED sweet chilli porridge
FAT BURNER (Fuel, Training)
L­-carnitine + capsaicin + caffeine + coconut oil
A lighter runner is a faster runner. For those of us looking to shed a few pounds to reach their perfect start weight for the big day ­ RED Runner’s Delight should find its way into our menu. Chilli is a source of natural capsaicin, which helps ratchet up metabolism. The effect is further enhanced by added caffeine and L­-carnitine, known to help the metabolism of fatty acids in mitochondria. An addition of coconut oil makes it a perfect source of Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCTs), which unlike other fats can be used as a quick energy source without increasing blood sugar level.


#WHITE plain vanilla porridge
VITAMIN SHOT (Fuel, Training)
100% DRI of all water-­soluble vitamins
Plain vanilla, no frills: a simple multivitamin covering you Daily Recommended Intake of water­-soluble vitamins. We swapped sugar for stevia to make this sweet treat even sweeter …and guilt­-free. A good start to your day.




#BLACK dark chocolate porridge
RACE DAY (Fuel, Race)
cocoa flavonoids + tannins + caffeine
We all know how important it is to watch what you eat in the run up to a big event. Simple carbs, little fibre, no spicy or heavy food ­ nothing that could upset your stomach. Many runners fear it so much they decide to run on empty…which is not a good idea. BLACK Runner’s Delight addresses the much-­feared mid-­race need to run: its reduced fibre content combined with added cocoa flavonoids and tannins known for their antidiarrhetic properties will make you feel fuelled and confident on the race day, and the added caffeine will cater for an extra energy boost.




#PURPLE Blueberry muffin porridge
IMMUNE SYSTEM (Fuel, Training /Race)
zinc + vitamin C + berberine + anthocyanins
Packed with zink​, natural vitamin C​ and anthocyanins ​from goi berries, acai berries, blueberries, barberries,​ tart cherries and dried barberry leaves (containing natural berberine),the PURPLE Runner’s Delight, thanks to its strong anti-­inflammatory and anti­oxidative effect, is a real immune system booster​. Plus, it’s the only blueberry muffin that won’t give you muffin tops.

#YELLOW banana & peanut butter porridge
HYDRATION (Fuel, Race / Training)
L­-citrulline + ions (Na, K, Ca, Mg)
L-­citrulline, a natural compound found in watermelons, has been found to improve VO2max and reduce muscle fatigue. You would have to down a whole pint of watermelon juice to absorb the recommended 10 mg of the nutrient which simply isn’t feasible before a run though. Instead, you can now enjoy banana & peanut butter flavoured Runner’s Delight with added citrulline and ions.

#CHERRY cherry tart porridge
ENDURANCE (Fuel, Race / Training)
beetroot + iron + vitamin C
Beetroots are a natural source of betaine and nitrates ((NO(3­)), ​which have acutely positive effects​ on the efficiency of the cardiovascular system. And addition of iron and vitamin C further enhance the positive effects.


#BROWN mocca porridge
ENERGY (Fuel, Race)
caffeine, maltodextrin
Caffeine is great for races, but too much coffee sloshing around your stomach can send you on a toilet run. Try BROWN Runner’s Delight with reduced fibre, added caffeine (1 00 mg per sachet) and balanced carbs with different IGs for sustained energy release. Tastes better than coffee!


#GREEN Cream cheese & herbs bagel
MUSCLE RECOVERY (Recovery, Training)
BCAA + bromelain + rutin
We have developed a special formula with added protein, branch chain amino-acids and the natural enzyme bromelain ​to foster post-­run muscle recovery and promote joint health. The RUTIN + BROMELAIN combination (natural glycosides and enzymes) has anti­-inflammatory properties and is even prescribed to treat inflammation and osteoarthritis . Several studies have found bromelain to be as effective in pain and inflammation management as Non-steroidal anti-­inflammatory drugs, without the adverse effects associated with the prolonged use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen (e.g. gastrointestinal side­-effects). It can prove effective against Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS), the most common knee injury in runners according to recent studies. Now you can indulge in the delicious flavour of cream cheese bagels and boost your joint and muscle health at the same time.


#ORANGE Tikka masala porridge
ANTI­INFLAMMATION (Recovery, Training)
ginger + turmeric + B­vitamins
Another shot of anti-­inflammatory agents: natural gingerols and curcumin found in ginger and turmeric work wonders for an upset stomach lining as well as sore muscles. It’s also packed with B-­vitamins which improve energy efficiency and have mood­-enhancing effects. Who doesn’t want this runners’ high to last a bit longer? Especially if it tastes like the good indian curry you’ve been denying yourself for so long?

Risks & Challenges
The greatest challenge we are facing now is to develop the supplement mixes in such way that they don’t change our delicious flavours. That’s why we are raising money to run all the lab taste-tests and develop bespoke formulas that will be virtually flavourless. 
Contingency plan: we are not going to compromise on either taste or the health benefits! If it turns out we need to opt out of adding certain supplements directly into our porridge, we will provide them in the form of capsules along with a clean, lite version of the given flavour. 
What if we don’t reach the fundraising goal? We will need to produce a ‘lite’ version of our porridge, i.e. without the added supplements for the time being.   Other Ways You Can Help Sharing is caring! Please share the campaign link on your social media profile!

<b>About the challenge:</b><br/>
<p></p>
<p>“Motu” a 27 feet Albin Vega built in 			1977, is in the port of Veere</p>
<p>(Holland) today, but me and my wife and our 			two daughters live in Hungary at</p>
<p>the Lake Balaton. Now the challenge 			is to get the boat in the middle of</p>
<p>Europe. The obvious solution would be 			to rent a truck and drive about</p>
<p>1500 km in maximum 2 days. But I have 			chosen the second option which is</p>
<p>to get on the boat and cruise 1986 km across 			Europe to her new “home”.</p>
<p>My answer for those who wonder why I 			prefer to face all the difficulties</p>
<p>waiting for me during the 30 days is:</p>
<p>“Not because they are easy, but 			because they are hard” (-JFK)</p>
<p></p>
<p>During the trip I will face lots of difficulties. I foresee some of them, but there will be surprises for sure.  I have started my Indiegogo campaign to make sure the
challenge doesn’t fail because of the money. My aim is not to get rich, but to
succeed. I believe this trip will inspire other boating fans to dream and
achieve unusual results. All supports will be compensated and moreover all tips
and advices are highly appreciated.</p>

<h3>Why Albin Vega?</h3> <p></p>Albin Vega is more than a boat, it is a legend. The first Albin Vega 			was  designed by Per Brohäll in Sweden and was introduced to the 			public in  1965 at the boat fairs in Paris, and in Hamburg. The 			design is based on the idea to create a tour-boat which is perfect 			for competition purposes  as well; which can equally cope with seas 			and lakes. The Vega became a  very popular class in the 60’s. 3450 			boats have been made in the Swedish  Albin Marine factory. There are 			at least 5 boats what successfully got  around the World and in 2000 			an Albin Vega has even reached Antarctica. <br/>  <p>My 			boat “Motu” was made in 1977, with serial number 2611. I have no  records 			about her early years, all I know is that the previous owner was  a 			German carpenter. He bought Motu 20 years ago and started to 			refurbish  the boat on his own. Year by year he had fixed, changed 			parts on Motu.  He could not enjoy the most important feature of the 			boat, sailing. He had only 2-3 weeks holiday every year, and he 			spent all of it on the  refurbishments. The boat has got ready in 			2012, but unfortunately the  owner died in 2013, so he could not 			reap the fruits of his hard work.  His widow has decided to sell 			Motu.</p>

This is not easy for me, not the fact that I'm asking for help, but to admit the humiliation of loose skin. I hear constantly ""Wow you look great!"" But I know what I'm hiding. I lost so much weight last year that my excess skin got so bad that I put on weight to fill it in. :-( Only those of you who have lost an excessive amount of weight understand. Loose skin from baring children can get very unsightly due to a few months of stretching, but that doesn't compare to years at 275-340 pounds for years. So this will give you an idea what I'm dealing with. No gym, no diet, no wrap, no nothing can correct this sad reality but surgery. What makes it most painful for me is the fact Iost that I weight naturally. I took my time, I studied myself into the ground how to do this right. I swear I could be a nutritionist, dietitian, and personal trainer lol. I did this the recommended way. The ""healthy"" way... And I still have the loose skin. I was assured this only happened to those who have barriatric procedures.. Lies.. I by no means am not downing bariatric surgery at all, now I wish I had went that route.  I later learned through my ""studies"" that basically stretch marks equal loose skin. Everywhere I have a lot of stretch marks needs work.  </span></p><p><span style="""">I am healthy now by the way *yaaay* I had blood pressure so high that my doctor told me to admit myself in the hospital because I was at risk for a stroke at any moment and needed to be monitored.

What makes it most painful for me is the fact Iost that I weight naturally. I took my time, I studied myself into the ground how to do this right. I swear I could be a nutritionist, dietitian, and personal trainer lol. I did this the recommended way. The ""healthy"" way... And I still have the loose skin. I was assured this only happened to those who have barriatric procedures.. Lies.. I by no means am not downing bariatric surgery at all, now I wish I had went that route.  I later learned through my ""studies"" that basically stretch marks equal loose skin. Everywhere I have a lot of stretch marks needs work.  I am healthy now by the way *yaaay* I had blood pressure so high that my doctor told me to admit myself in the hospital because I was at risk for a stroke at any moment and needed to be monitored. Last week the doctor told me my blood pressure was better than his. *smiles* I was also pre diabetic and was told I needed to be on medication. I finally have a clean bill of health.I am now at the final stages of this emotional roller coaster that I've been riding for years. IT'S TIME TO GET OFF! Any amount you can contribute will be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you all. (If you can't give, I ask for your prayers!)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>You know, at some point we are actually going to have to do
something about the climate change issue. We can’t escape the warnings of
global climate change and the future shortages of global energy – not a day goes by that we are not reminded of it. </p>
<p>But what can we
do? <b>Driving EVs and going green at home is expensive, and at times even not
feasible</b>. Also, how much of what we do individually even counts in our global
struggle for a clean future? Well say no more, Verd2GO, with its patent-pending new product and platform is here to put an end to
these concerns.</p>

<p>If we do these above things, and do them well, we can expedite our path to low-cost yet clean energy without major changes. Energy Independence is big! Not just from foreign oil, but from current bottlenecks and limitations. </p>
<p>Historically, it has been hard to hold onto energy and moving it around, storing it and then delivering it efficiently where and how we need it. That’s why carbon-based dirty energy sources, like petro-chemicals are still around.
They’re transportable.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Every time a new product is brought to market, there are both risks and challenges. A lot can be beyond the control of the visionaries or company. We can de-risk all stages of production, testing and delivery, and that is what we have done. </p>
<p>We have partnered with  an energy storage company who are pioneers of lithium-based batteries for electric vehicles and leaders in grid storage. </p>
<p>With deployed battery-based energy storage units in operations, our partners have manufacturing facilities and expertise in North America, Europe and Asia. If you had a project like Verd2GO to bring to the world, you could not choose a better combo of a team than this. </p>
<p>Additionally, we also have advisers in national research institutions, and former executives of large secondary and tertiary market interests to guide us through different phases.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We want to enter full production run by middle of next year, and get testing done as well. If we are for some reason unable to raise the full amount, we will just be doing the testing, and manufacturing will be delayed, taking the world closer to more inefficiencies and dirty power. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We plan to build more test units and
certification prototypes, then begin production tooling with our established supply
chain and distribution channels in meeting minimum order quantity requirements of our manufacturers. We then plan to commence volume production and delivery. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In order to do this, we want the beginning to be bottom-up; recognize the people and groups who have helped us in putting this plan into action. <b>To implement our model, and to start manufacturing and production, we want your help! </b><br/></span></p>

<div><b>Q. What is with the name ""Verd2GO""?</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b>A: </b>Verd2GO, is pronounced like <i>Vertigo</i>,<i> </i>consisting of <b>Verd</b>/Verde, a romanic/neo-latin word for green to signify green energy, and the word to-go (<b>2GO</b>) to relay the ability to take it with you wherever you go. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Today, technology has made us mobile, always on-the-go, we share more - things we felt needed to happen with energy as well.

<p><b>Q. But average drive-time is only 40 miles, and it falls within most EV range.</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>Bill Gates famously had <i>supposedly</i> said ""No one will need more than 637 kb of memory for a

<p>Our point is, that for some thing to truly go mainstream, we need to remove any limits or ceilings on what it can do,  or how far it can go.

<p><b>Q. How is model different
than Tesla or Better Place swapping?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>Tesla and Better Place share a common vision of what tomorrow can be. We share that same vision, and want to do our part towards that goal. Verd2GO batteries are not proprietary to a singular make or model of cars, which is what Tesla swap stations and Better Place catered to. If I am running on 2% battery on a Nissan Leaf and have to be somewhere, I cannot/could not just go to those swapping stations to switch out my batteries. Also, I'm not particularly keen on
trading out my brand new battery pack for some (possibly) older or damaged one. We do not want to re-segment the market any further, we want more folks to be exited to have an EV. </p>
<p>We don’t want the main
pack to be standardized as it has different OEM design specs, just the swappable reserve Verd2GO batteries. Think of us as an industry
USB for car's energy. Or batteries for your flashlight. If each flashlight had a different type of battery for each instead of standard AA batteries, we would perhaps be more okay with the darkness. And that is not okay with us.  </p>
<p><b>Q. Why now?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> We cannot keep waiting
decades for a single bullet or breakthrough battery that will save the world,
if there is not much of the world left to save by the end of those decades. </p>

</div></div>","We attempt to re-imagine the way we generate, manage and consume energy. Verd2GO is designed to displace a system that made sense a century ago. 
You now have the ability to take renewable energy from and to your home, to power your car, charge all your devices at once and much more WITHOUT the necessity of Grid power

Verd2GO   

 
You know, at some point we are actually going to have to do
something about the climate change issue. We can’t escape the warnings of
global climate change and the future shortages of global energy – not a day goes by that we are not reminded of it. 
But what can we
do? Driving EVs and going green at home is expensive, and at times even not
feasible. Also, how much of what we do individually even counts in our global
struggle for a clean future? Well say no more, Verd2GO, with its patent-pending new product and platform is here to put an end to
these concerns.
With Verd2GO, you can now:



What is it, and how do we do it?




If we do these above things, and do them well, we can expedite our path to low-cost yet clean energy without major changes. Energy Independence is big! Not just from foreign oil, but from current bottlenecks and limitations. 
Historically, it has been hard to hold onto energy and moving it around, storing it and then delivering it efficiently where and how we need it. That’s why carbon-based dirty energy sources, like petro-chemicals are still around.
They’re transportable.

The pace of technology today, however, is
rapid, and we are aiming to displace a system that made sense a century ago. With
Verd2GO, you now have the ability to take renewable energy from and to your
home, to power your car while you are on your way to a picnic, where you can
charge all your devices at once, without the necessity of dirty grid power. 

How it works


Verd2GO isn't some clunky metal box, or conduit with wires and plugs - we designed it with user-focus in mind.



Features





Full-Control


If you are not around your home or car, and cannot interact with it, don't worry, our iOS and android app will allow you to control Verd2GO remotely.
Besides that, we
are creating a brand new market to develop all sorts of related
energy gathering technological devices, apps and services – which is why we
will open up our APIs and provide SDKs to developers to create new and exciting
opportunities for all. 



This single mobile app revolutionize your energy use, at home, on the road and anywhere in between. 


Don't let one of the most important aspect of modern life be a set of background events that you can't control (grid rates, gas price increases or emissions), take ""charge"" of your life, and save money with cleaner energy, everywhere.  













We can no longer accept that in this day and age, we still struggle to refuel electric cars, and spend hours in charging. 

If a gas vehicle took 4-6 hours to refuel at the gas station, we would all honestly still be riding horses.




The image on the left was in 1924, notice, how a gasoline fuel driven vehicle was
propped on a platform to refuel. Kind of like the other battery swapping
platforms for electric vehicles of today (right). In stark contrast, take a look at an
electric vehicle from 1917 in the middle; it uses swapping system much simpler to operate. 

Today, the order is out of whack - we fuel our cars with
harmful and extremely inefficient chemicals dug from its thousand year old underground
home, deep inside a faraway country to be shipped thousands of miles and
converted inefficiently. 
Still that is made easy, while recharging an electric vehicle is hard - we have this fear of getting stranded in an electric vehicle because it takes hours to charge even though efficient and homegrown electricity seems to be everywhere. Which is precisely why we plan to set this right again. 

In a year and a half (2017), a hundred years since the electric vehicle photograph above was taken, we will have set things right. 
With your help, we bring about the future the way it should be...







The future of energy isn’t just
about to come. It’s already here. We are bringing the future closer, today –
dreaming and inventing the energy technologies that will define generations to
come.



Verd2GO
removes the barriers to entry for average folks to actively participate in the
business of harnessing, distributing and selling clean power. Once there is a
convenient, simple and intuitive way to sell energy into the grid, we can
address our important energy issues and clean power plans. 



A lot of energy is
all around us. Instead of wasting it, why not harness it and put it to use? Verd2GO
is the standardized currency that allows this seamlessly - an easy and shareable way to store clean, renewable energy for when it’s needed.


We don’t expect anyone to completely
change your energy behavior, just do what you do, the Verd2GO way!  
We have completely changed our interaction with energy. The P2P (peer-to-peer) energy network in the sharing economy!


You can’t kill an idea whose time has come!
Verd2GO adds a new dimension of flexibility to energy. Imagine smart phones or handheld devices and the old rotary dial landlines. Why be connected to the wall while you talk and be stuck in a given location, when you can take your conversations on-the-go with greater functionality. 
Beyond convenience, it allows clean energy to be modular and ubiquitous! 

The Impact


If energy was discovered and planned out today, this is what the world would look like! We have dreamed up a real way to easily and cost-effectively integrate it to our existing system.



Folks now can actually enjoy going
off-grid, electric vehicle owners and drivers get mental satisfaction knowing they will not run out of
charge. A solar home will not be without power on a cloudy day or at night, and
off-peak grid energy will no longer be wasted.


Even cooler, the wasted off-peak energy can actually be used to power gasoline vehicles, increasing gas mileage and saving money in the process (not to mention emissions).




This also significantly reduces oil imports in addition to the need for new, dirty-coal fired plants, saving millions of further emissions and dollars for everyone, effectively extending the life of the planet and providing one way of saving the future of our world! 


Were you aware that current US consumption of gasoline is around 121,000,000,000 gallons a year? 

or that American cars and trucks expel around 3,000,000,000,000 tonnes of carbon into the air annually? 

...and did you know that the US government also sends more than $1 billion a day overseas to acquire oil resources for the future?

That is scary. Something needs to be done. 
And we show you the what and the how...



      


So if you are worried about the environment and you don’t have an electric vehicle or roof full of solar, don’t worry! 

Even if you have a gas car, or non-solar home, you can help out an EV driver, or lower your gas intake, while using rented solar power you just picked up at the store to partially (or fully) power your needs at home during demand times. 





Buildings


We are rethinking supply-side and demand side energy and turning conventional energy delivery on its head. 

Of the 120 million or so households in the United States, less than 16 million are in a position to install solar panels at home. Solar has primarily benefited the minority homeowners with good credit and a south-facing roof with no shading. 
Verd2GO changes that - now the remaining 100 million households could enjoy solar.
Still think you need to own a home, or have cash for installing solar panels on your roof? Think again!

Be solar powered, even when you don’t have a single solar panel on your roof (or even a roof)! 
Verd2GO - The Solar vending machine. 



Transportation


Get paid for turning in energy from your cars. Or gain an instant mpg boost thanks to Verd2GO.
Uber is not the only way to make money using your vehicle!




Critics argue that electric cars won’t go mainstream until they have the
same range as conventional gasoline vehicles. Well critics, meet Verd2GO. You never wanted an electric vehicle till you met us. 
Although electric vehicles are more efficient, a dirty, coal-powered plant is likely the one powering it. With Verd2GO you can rapidly charge up with all clean power.


EVs are here to stay, and this time, for good.


A simple add-on to your car can make all the difference between range anxiety and unlimited range!


Tired of waiting hours to refuel your electric car? Scared to take a trip? All charging plugs taken? Just zip into a Verd2GO station and recharge in no time!




President Obama said at the State of the Union in 2011, that by this year (2015) 1 million electric vehicles will be on the roads in America. Sadly, we are barely a third of the way there. The main barriers being price, range and charging times/availability.

We solved all those. And then some.

The future looks vastly different



                                Paradigm. Shifted.




















We have been developing and testing our technology, and are currently on our third prototype for battery modules, and on our first kiosk prototype. 


GET YOUR PERKS!


That is cool and all, but what am I getting?
For your help, we want to recognize you. Indefinitely. Publicly. Materially even.Enough with plugs and wires, were you ever delayed because your phone was still plugged in to the wall at less-than-half-charge? Are you scared to play music or keep the GPS on when on the road and power is low? 

Are you one of those poor souls at the airport laying on the floor next to the restrooms, or huddle up uncomfortably too close to strangers by the outlet, attempting to charge your phone which is at 3%, five minutes before your next flight starts boarding?
Well don't! Get yourself a portable power pack (or a couple of them) of your choosing from the right side, or any of the goodies there, to tell the world how you played the critical part in saving it. It helps us in our shared quest for a safe, equitable and clean future of energy!

Risks and Challenges

Every time a new product is brought to market, there are both risks and challenges. A lot can be beyond the control of the visionaries or company. We can de-risk all stages of production, testing and delivery, and that is what we have done. 
We have partnered with  an energy storage company who are pioneers of lithium-based batteries for electric vehicles and leaders in grid storage. 
With deployed battery-based energy storage units in operations, our partners have manufacturing facilities and expertise in North America, Europe and Asia. If you had a project like Verd2GO to bring to the world, you could not choose a better combo of a team than this. 
Additionally, we also have advisers in national research institutions, and former executives of large secondary and tertiary market interests to guide us through different phases.

We want to enter full production run by middle of next year, and get testing done as well. If we are for some reason unable to raise the full amount, we will just be doing the testing, and manufacturing will be delayed, taking the world closer to more inefficiencies and dirty power. 
We plan to build more test units and
certification prototypes, then begin production tooling with our established supply
chain and distribution channels in meeting minimum order quantity requirements of our manufacturers. We then plan to commence volume production and delivery. 
In order to do this, we want the beginning to be bottom-up; recognize the people and groups who have helped us in putting this plan into action. To implement our model, and to start manufacturing and production, we want your help!

Questions & Answers

Q. What is with the name ""Verd2GO""?


A: Verd2GO, is pronounced like Vertigo, consisting of Verd/Verde, a romanic/neo-latin word for green to signify green energy, and the word to-go (2GO) to relay the ability to take it with you wherever you go. 

Today, technology has made us mobile, always on-the-go, we share more - things we felt needed to happen with energy as well. No longer should we be okay with plugged to an inefficient grid through miles of unsightly wiring, or plugged in to it using our vehicles for a long, long time and miss the world go by.




Q. But average drive-time is only 40 miles, and it falls within most EV range.
A: Bill Gates famously had supposedly said ""No one will need more than 637 kb of memory for a
personal computer"". Most of the images you see in this page are more than that. 
Our point is, that for some thing to truly go mainstream, we need to remove any limits or ceilings on what it can do,  or how far it can go. Although EVs are good as a transport option, consumers have a great fear of range anxiety when the vehicles are down for a few hours. Then they are useless, and even dangerous with the possibility of getting stranded for hours in a place where you don't want to be stuck. 
In the winter, or going up a hill, range suffers (trust us, we drive EVs and it gets pretty cold here) - with Verd2GO you can overcome these inevitable happenings. 
Q. How is model different
than Tesla or Better Place swapping?
A: Tesla and Better Place share a common vision of what tomorrow can be. We share that same vision, and want to do our part towards that goal. Verd2GO batteries are not proprietary to a singular make or model of cars, which is what Tesla swap stations and Better Place catered to. If I am running on 2% battery on a Nissan Leaf and have to be somewhere, I cannot/could not just go to those swapping stations to switch out my batteries. Also, I'm not particularly keen on
trading out my brand new battery pack for some (possibly) older or damaged one. We do not want to re-segment the market any further, we want more folks to be exited to have an EV. 
We don’t want the main
pack to be standardized as it has different OEM design specs, just the swappable reserve Verd2GO batteries. Think of us as an industry
USB for car's energy. Or batteries for your flashlight. If each flashlight had a different type of battery for each instead of standard AA batteries, we would perhaps be more okay with the darkness. And that is not okay with us.  
Q. Why now?
A: We cannot keep waiting
decades for a single bullet or breakthrough battery that will save the world,
if there is not much of the world left to save by the end of those decades. 
A lot of innovative energy technologies are coming up, but there is no universal metric to understand or interpret them, no one-stop-shop to understand and manage them. Even Solar Roadways would need storage if they are to convert the nation's roads with solar cells*.

A place to call our own, a place for mind, body, & soul healing for the 'whole' family. 


The Man Behind the Vision



                            
""Buddhas got my back!""
Jeff Emerson, the founder of True Freedom Recovery Yoga, is a member of 
long-term recovery with 22 years clean. Jeff has taught meditation in 
halfway houses, prisons, homeless shelters, and juvenile detention 
centers. Jeff is a Reiki Master with an E-RYT500 and is studying to be a
 Zen Priest. Jeff is the founder of one of the world's first 200-hour teaching programs for people in 12-Step Recovery. Jeff is the founder of the first known non-profit yoga studio, A Policy 
for Caring, dedicated to yoga, meditation, and the recovery process. Jeff has been practicing yoga and meditation for nearly 20 years and has been imparting his wisdom and sharing his gift with people from all walks of life for the past seven years. 

The Woman Behind the Vision



Sondra Emerson, a member of long-term recovery with 26 years clean, is an integral part of the True Freedom Recovery Yoga vision. While Jeff's intent is to secure a building of his own to provide a place to call 'home' for people in recovery to heal mind, body, & soul, Sondra felt strongly about including the children of the persons in recovery to provide them with an outlet to acquire skills in healing through internal and external assets, in tandem with their families.Sondra has planned this campaign as well as various other fundraisers to secure resources and support to see their combined visions come to fruition.



  What is our intent?
  This capital campaign is intended to fund the purchase of our very own building. True Freedom Recovery Yoga is currently operating out of a leased space in Cincinnati, Ohio. The owners of the building have plans for this space at some point in the future. Our time here while temporary, has allowed us to build a foundation of support and a strong network of individuals who are committed and dedicated to healing. 
Many powerful transformations have happened inside of these walls; Jeff holds yoga, meditation, and recovery sessions here seven days a week ranging from restoration to empowerment, which include 50 minutes of yoga, 10 minutes of meditation, and 30 minutes of a recovery meeting. Lives are changing, people are nurturing their spirits, and families are becoming closer and more connected.
    Jeff wishes to expand True Freedom's mission to include programming and healing for the children of the families who have found the benefits of yoga and meditation to enhance and enrich their recovery. Not all who attend are a part of a 12-step fellowship; the healing, growth, and deep bonds everyone finds within one another is involuntarily infectious. Meet Gia...

And a few of our young yoga enthusiasts...
       
       
All funds raised during this campaign will go to our non-profit, A Policy for Caring Inc. to help with capital and capacity building.  If we don't reach our goal, we are building this village anyway--it is just a matter of time! We have a good thing started. We aspire to become more effective and more efficient in time.We hope you will consider a gift of any amount to True Freedom Recovery Yoga.

<h3>Background </h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>There is lack of transparency in where funding is allocated and spent, with reports of millions allocated contrasting with <a href=""http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/miserable-ramadan-awaits-kelantan-flood-victims-living-in-tents"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>destitute and desperate victims still in tents</a> months after the disaster. To research and expose this gap between Federal Government budget allocations and what is happening on the ground we plan to do a social audit on the Federal Government spending for flood recovery that has been allocated. The flood funds will be broken down in details based on where the funds channelled to and resources that have been spent on. Once the allocations of this funds are published publicly by using <a href=""http://community.openspending.org/help/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Open Spending web application</a>, citizens will monitor the Federal Government based on the mentioned details and then will comment further if the action has been taken. </span></p>

Numerous news articles have been reported that the Federal Government has allocated RM 893 million under the 2015 Budget for flood mitigation projects in addition to the initial aids channeled to the affected families and business communities.

My name is Jerome Freedman. The little boy in the video
is my son, Micah. Other than being father and son, we have a common experience. We both are cancer survivors - Micah for 39 years and me for almost 19
years – and we both used the <b><i>Seven Principles of Mindfulness in Healing</i></b>
to thrive and succeed in our healing. Micah is  now 46 and never had a recurrence.<br/><br/>
<p>Now, you too, can learn to use the seven principles of
mindfulness in <b><i>Healing with the Seven Principles of
Mindfulness: How to Thrive and Succeed in a Complex Cancer System</i></b>.
If you or anyone you know has cancer the <i>Seven
Principles of Mindfulness in Healing</i> can guide your way home through
diagnosis, treatment and recovery.</p>
<p>We are holding this campaign for one major reason and
your participation will go a long way to helping us meet our goal. Our primary objective is to touch the lives of the many thousands of people facing a cancer
diagnosis each day as well as their families, caretakers and friends by <b>sending them free copies</b> of <i>Healing
with the Seven Principles of Mindfulness</i>.<br/></p><p>We  will use your
donations to:</p><ol>
<li>
<b>Send free copies</b> of <i>Healing
with the Seven Principles of Mindfulness</i> to oncology and radiology doctors,
cancer research institutions, medical schools, complementary providers, hospitals and the like around the world for them to share
with their patients. <br/>
</li>
<li>Produce and send copies of <i>Healing with the Seven Principles of Mindfulness</i> and the other books mentioned in the perks.<br/>
</li>
</ol><p>Your donations may lead you to become <b>advocates for healthcare</b> and take charge
of your healing experience. This is the first principle of <i>Mindfulness in Healing</i>. Dr. Kelly Turner, PhD has shown that taking
control of your own healthcare is one of
the nine factors for Radical Remission<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Please donate <b>now!</b><br/></p>

<p>I wrote <i>Healing with the Seven Principles of Mindfulness</i> in order to inspire you to be the boss of your medical treatment and to share with you how and why you should do it.</p><p>The Seven Principles of Mindfulness in Healing have been formulated over the past 39 years – ever since Micah had cancer. Up until now, they have been implicit in 
everything I did for my son and for myself. When I first was diagnosed 
with muscle invasive bladder cancer in 1997 and then again at the end 2013, I immediately applied these principles and now I am cancer free with all my body parts!<br/></p><p>At the beginning of 2012, I began making these principles explicit so 
that I could share them with you in the form of a book.</p><p>Becoming and advocate for your own healthcare is your first stop on your path to well-being. Once you adopt this principle, a daily meditation practice provides you 
with the foundation to recognize and know what is going on in your body, your 
feelings, your thoughts and your mind. With just nine minutes a day, you
 can learn to calm your mind and make appropriate choices for your medical
 care.<br/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Seven Principles of <br/>Mindfulness in Healing</h2><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434153467/fcfvdvieht8lmv1ozyip.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE</strong>: Take a stand and be in control

of alternative therapies that will further your healing and give you a 
sense of well-being on your journey to wellness.</p>
<p><strong>MAKE HEALTH-PROMOTING LIFESTYLE CHANGES</strong>: These will include your opting for healthy dietary choices and energizing exercises.</p>
<p><strong>PRACTICE DAILY MEDITATION</strong>: Tune into yourself to discover your body sensations, thoughts, and feelings.</p>

</p><p></p><p>""Dr. Freedman speaks from experience, both as a cancer
survivor himself, and the father of a Radical Remission cancer survivor. His
book, ""Healing with 7 Principles of Mindfulness"" gives readers a
nurturing, helping hand throughout the entire cancer journey, especially with
regard to developing a meditation practice.""</p>
<p><b>-Kelly Turner</b>, PhD, Author of the NYTimes Bestseller
<i>""Radical Remission: Surviving Cancer Against All Odds""</i></p>
<p>""Healing with 7 Principles of Mindfulness"" is a valuable guide to navigating the complex terrain of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Blending his direct experience with cancer and a deep practice in mindfulness and guided imagery, Dr. Jerome Freedman offers a unique and valuable perspective with mindful healing approaches.</p>
<p><b>-Leslie Davenport</b>, Author of <i>Healing and Transformation Through Self Guided Imagery</i></p>
<p>I am a 19 year parotid gland cancer survivor, a type of
cancer that can return at any time. In addition to traditional western medicine
protocol, as part of my healing process, I have used many different alternative
healing modalities. The approach that Jerome has documented in his book
coincide with my experience of surviving cancer. His book is a great resource
for anyone facing the trauma and challenges of a serious health crisis.</p>
<p><b>--Julie Bernard</b>, Homeopath</p>

“Jerome Freeman’s “Healing with the Seven Principles of
Mindfulness” is a user-friendly approach to make practical (very practical!)
specific things that can empower each person to achieve higher levels of
health.  These principles are not just logical and rational, they work…and
they just feel ‘right.’  These principles will not only improve your
health, they will improve your life!”
<p><b>--Dana Ullman</b>, MPH, CCH Author of 10 books, including two that contain a Foreword by the
Physician to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, “The Homeopathic Revolution,”
“Discovering Homeopathy,” and “Everybody’s Guide to Homeopathic Medicines”
(co-authored with Stephen Cummings, MD)</p>
<br/><p>I have reviewed your Indiegoogo campaign page and book.
Miracle! Truly, the story of your son will touch the hearts of millions.</p>
Your vision of the book being available to those
diagnosed with Cancer is admirable, and something that I greatly align myself
with. As someone who recently started meditating, I see the healing effects of
mediation, and would love to share it with the world.<p></p><p><b>--Alicia Dunams</b> Author of <i>Goal Digger: Lessons Learned from the Rich Men I Dated</i><br/></p><p>
</p><p>This book is great! Dr.Freedman
allows the reader to journey with him as he harnesses the power of mindfulness
to heal himself from Cancer. He also brings the reader along with him as he
carefully and meticulously considers the many options of both alternative
and traditional healing approaches. The Seven Steps is both
""practical"" and ""spiritual"". Especially the part of having
your friends and loved ones being an essential part of your healing
journey. Would recommend this book to people going through health challenges,
as well as r those who want to obtain a greater insight into the power of
mindfulness. </p>

Our Story
Hello! Thank you for visiting.
My name is Jerome Freedman. The little boy in the video
is my son, Micah. Other than being father and son, we have a common experience. We both are cancer survivors - Micah for 39 years and me for almost 19
years – and we both used the Seven Principles of Mindfulness in Healing
to thrive and succeed in our healing. Micah is  now 46 and never had a recurrence.
Now, you too, can learn to use the seven principles of
mindfulness in Healing with the Seven Principles of
Mindfulness: How to Thrive and Succeed in a Complex Cancer System.
If you or anyone you know has cancer the Seven
Principles of Mindfulness in Healing can guide your way home through
diagnosis, treatment and recovery.
We are holding this campaign for one major reason and
your participation will go a long way to helping us meet our goal. Our primary objective is to touch the lives of the many thousands of people facing a cancer
diagnosis each day as well as their families, caretakers and friends by sending them free copies of Healing
with the Seven Principles of Mindfulness.We  will use your
donations to:

Send free copies of Healing
with the Seven Principles of Mindfulness to oncology and radiology doctors,
cancer research institutions, medical schools, complementary providers, hospitals and the like around the world for them to share
with their patients. 

Produce and send copies of Healing with the Seven Principles of Mindfulness and the other books mentioned in the perks.

Your donations may lead you to become advocates for healthcare and take charge
of your healing experience. This is the first principle of Mindfulness in Healing. Dr. Kelly Turner, PhD has shown that taking
control of your own healthcare is one of
the nine factors for Radical Remission1.Please donate now!
Why I WroteHealing with the Seven Principles of Mindfulness
I wrote Healing with the Seven Principles of Mindfulness in order to inspire you to be the boss of your medical treatment and to share with you how and why you should do it.The Seven Principles of Mindfulness in Healing have been formulated over the past 39 years – ever since Micah had cancer. Up until now, they have been implicit in 
everything I did for my son and for myself. When I first was diagnosed 
with muscle invasive bladder cancer in 1997 and then again at the end 2013, I immediately applied these principles and now I am cancer free with all my body parts!At the beginning of 2012, I began making these principles explicit so 
that I could share them with you in the form of a book.Becoming and advocate for your own healthcare is your first stop on your path to well-being. Once you adopt this principle, a daily meditation practice provides you 
with the foundation to recognize and know what is going on in your body, your 
feelings, your thoughts and your mind. With just nine minutes a day, you
 can learn to calm your mind and make appropriate choices for your medical
 care.The Seven Principles of Mindfulness in HealingBE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE: Take a stand and be in control
 of your healing experience. Don’t just roll over and let the medical 
establishment run over you.
INVESTIGATE ALTERNATIVES: There is a magical world 
of alternative therapies that will further your healing and give you a 
sense of well-being on your journey to wellness.
MAKE HEALTH-PROMOTING LIFESTYLE CHANGES: These will include your opting for healthy dietary choices and energizing exercises.
PRACTICE DAILY MEDITATION: Tune into yourself to discover your body sensations, thoughts, and feelings.
CREATE YOUR OWN MEDICAL TEAM: Look for experts who know both Eastern and Western methods so that you can get the widest range of medical support.
REACH OUT TO OTHERS: Ask your family and friends for support and join a support group to share your healing challenges and experiences.
GIVE BACK: When you are ready, you will find joy and meaning in helping other people and giving back to your community.

What People are Saying


""Dr. Freedman speaks from experience, both as a cancer
survivor himself, and the father of a Radical Remission cancer survivor. His
book, ""Healing with 7 Principles of Mindfulness"" gives readers a
nurturing, helping hand throughout the entire cancer journey, especially with
regard to developing a meditation practice.""
-Kelly Turner, PhD, Author of the NYTimes Bestseller
""Radical Remission: Surviving Cancer Against All Odds""
""Healing with 7 Principles of Mindfulness"" is a valuable guide to navigating the complex terrain of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Blending his direct experience with cancer and a deep practice in mindfulness and guided imagery, Dr. Jerome Freedman offers a unique and valuable perspective with mindful healing approaches.
-Leslie Davenport, Author of Healing and Transformation Through Self Guided Imagery
I am a 19 year parotid gland cancer survivor, a type of
cancer that can return at any time. In addition to traditional western medicine
protocol, as part of my healing process, I have used many different alternative
healing modalities. The approach that Jerome has documented in his book
coincide with my experience of surviving cancer. His book is a great resource
for anyone facing the trauma and challenges of a serious health crisis.
--Julie Bernard, Homeopath

“Jerome Freeman’s “Healing with the Seven Principles of
Mindfulness” is a user-friendly approach to make practical (very practical!)
specific things that can empower each person to achieve higher levels of
health.  These principles are not just logical and rational, they work…and
they just feel ‘right.’  These principles will not only improve your
health, they will improve your life!”
--Dana Ullman, MPH, CCH Author of 10 books, including two that contain a Foreword by the
Physician to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, “The Homeopathic Revolution,”
“Discovering Homeopathy,” and “Everybody’s Guide to Homeopathic Medicines”
(co-authored with Stephen Cummings, MD)
I have reviewed your Indiegoogo campaign page and book.
Miracle! Truly, the story of your son will touch the hearts of millions.
Your vision of the book being available to those
diagnosed with Cancer is admirable, and something that I greatly align myself
with. As someone who recently started meditating, I see the healing effects of
mediation, and would love to share it with the world.--Alicia Dunams Author of Goal Digger: Lessons Learned from the Rich Men I Dated
This book is great! Dr.Freedman
allows the reader to journey with him as he harnesses the power of mindfulness
to heal himself from Cancer. He also brings the reader along with him as he
carefully and meticulously considers the many options of both alternative
and traditional healing approaches. The Seven Steps is both
""practical"" and ""spiritual"". Especially the part of having
your friends and loved ones being an essential part of your healing
journey. Would recommend this book to people going through health challenges,
as well as r those who want to obtain a greater insight into the power of
mindfulness.

Awakening To Infinity.

</p><p>Revolutionary, Biosband offers an electro acupuncture session to help you fight the endless feelings of hunger, often difficult to manage during a diet. It is an excellent alternative to appetite suppressant supplements. In addition, this method is 100% natural. We use the same method used in hospitals, we have simply reduced the size of the unit.</p>
<p>The Biosband is a watch-like device worn on the ventral side of the wrist.  When activated, the device emits low-level electrical pulses across 4 small connectors on its underside, stimulating the median nerve (an acupuncture point). Biosband utilizes gentle user-controlled electrical stimulation to send messages to your brain and blocks the signals that cause bulimia, without the headaches, drowsiness and other side effects associated with medicinal remedies.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447230376/oub6ehnsqfudy15gvj4s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/dvlr2ep2w/image/upload/v1447945072/BiosBand3_06_kues5c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>

</p><p><br/></p><p>The anterior surface of the wrist is covered by three meridians : meridian Lung (P), the meridian of the heart (C) and (MC) heart of the master meridian and CS, some points are used to treat specific disorders such as on the meridian P7 and P9 lung points on the meridian of the heart C5 points C6, C7 and the master of the heart meridian  points (MC6) (CS6) (MC7) (CS7).</p>
<p>Their use, together or individually, is known to give outstanding results. Pursuant to these data, the Biosband  using the technique of electro acupressure, electrical stimulation of acupuncture points, was designed to act on behavioral disorders, such as stress. With the anti-stress program (Stress &amp; Anxiety), the Biosband stimulates with  very gentle low voltage and low intensity pulses on  specific acupuncture points.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447230455/wwtk9ilhzdby4vxdmk72.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>
</p><p>The Biosband is a nerve stimulation connected device that helps to reduce and regulate your appetite.  It is a safe, 100 % drug free, highly effective, and clinically proven solution without the side effects associated with medications. The Biosband device generates gentle nerve impulses that travel through the body’s central nervous system to the higher emetic center in the brain.</p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447230523/w1mxvco5rhtn6yo7b73x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/dvlr2ep2w/image/upload/v1447231127/Gif-Femme1_aqw2vu.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>
</p><p><br/></p><p>Biosband will turn on automatically for 2 minutes, 30 and 15 minutes before each meal, in order to effectively ward off hunger pangs.The first effects will be felt after following a period 10 to 15 days, subject to 8 to 14 sessions of 2 minutes each day very regularly. </p>
<p>Acupuncture is based on the development of energy circulating in the human body, conveyed through channels called meridians at the skin contacting surface of the internal organs by subchannels. These meridians include energy points "" call acupuncture points"",  whose stimulation by electrical impulses acts on behavioral disorders of the individual. These energy fluctuations reflect changes or Yin Yang. The Chinese concept of medicine is based on the modifications of these two energies, either excess or deficiency.</p>
<p>The trips range from the chest to the arms and then the arm to the head then head to feet and feet to the chest according to specific schedules and to solar time.</p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447230542/wenswgujxydtiun7eewi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>

</p><p><br/></p><p>On ""Biosband connect app"" you indicate the schedules of your meals.Just slip it on your wrist, adjust the intensity to suit your individual needs. Cursor power settings enable the wearer to control the level of stimulation and because you can feel it working within minutes, you can adjust the device accordingly with indicator lights showing when it's operating and when the rechargeable  battery is low .  </p>
<p> Drug free: the Biosband provides relief for craving and helps reduce the appetite without the use of medication by stimulating the median nerve located on the underside of the wrist.</p>
<p>It will not interfere with medications, nor cause drug-related side effects. The Biosband was specifically designed to provide a comfortable level of stimulation enabling the device to be used for long-term, continuous use.</p>
<p>Continuously effective: unlike the pressure bands, where the body quickly adapts to the effect of static pressure, Biosband sends cyclic electronic pulses that provide continual effectiveness for as long as the user has the device turned on.</p>
<p>Usage is easy—just strap it on the underside of your wrist and your smartphone will do the work.</p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447230690/eovgaafs5bz58ktfuhro.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447230698/tto3dgfofyuutm9sxpgg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447230706/hhkwkvvvdcgsorss1jb8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>

</div></div>","Inspired by technology used in hospitals, our revolutionary technology helps you regain control over your appetite and craving,  so you can get on with your weight, and it will help you  reduce and regulate your appetite.
Revolutionary, Biosband offers an electro acupuncture session to help you fight the endless feelings of hunger, often difficult to manage during a diet. It is an excellent alternative to appetite suppressant supplements. In addition, this method is 100% natural. We use the same method used in hospitals, we have simply reduced the size of the unit.
The Biosband is a watch-like device worn on the ventral side of the wrist.  When activated, the device emits low-level electrical pulses across 4 small connectors on its underside, stimulating the median nerve (an acupuncture point). Biosband utilizes gentle user-controlled electrical stimulation to send messages to your brain and blocks the signals that cause bulimia, without the headaches, drowsiness and other side effects associated with medicinal remedies.
If acupuncture (electro stimulation) was initially used in hospitals, this technique will now prompt you to use the Biosband bracelet at home. Over time, you  will succeed in calming  your cravings and quickly lose extra fat.
The anterior surface of the wrist is covered by three meridians : meridian Lung (P), the meridian of the heart (C) and (MC) heart of the master meridian and CS, some points are used to treat specific disorders such as on the meridian P7 and P9 lung points on the meridian of the heart C5 points C6, C7 and the master of the heart meridian  points (MC6) (CS6) (MC7) (CS7).
Their use, together or individually, is known to give outstanding results. Pursuant to these data, the Biosband  using the technique of electro acupressure, electrical stimulation of acupuncture points, was designed to act on behavioral disorders, such as stress. With the anti-stress program (Stress & Anxiety), the Biosband stimulates with  very gentle low voltage and low intensity pulses on  specific acupuncture points.
The Biosband is a nerve stimulation connected device that helps to reduce and regulate your appetite.  It is a safe, 100 % drug free, highly effective, and clinically proven solution without the side effects associated with medications. The Biosband device generates gentle nerve impulses that travel through the body’s central nervous system to the higher emetic center in the brain.
Biosband will turn on automatically for 2 minutes, 30 and 15 minutes before each meal, in order to effectively ward off hunger pangs.The first effects will be felt after following a period 10 to 15 days, subject to 8 to 14 sessions of 2 minutes each day very regularly. 
Acupuncture is based on the development of energy circulating in the human body, conveyed through channels called meridians at the skin contacting surface of the internal organs by subchannels. These meridians include energy points "" call acupuncture points"",  whose stimulation by electrical impulses acts on behavioral disorders of the individual. These energy fluctuations reflect changes or Yin Yang. The Chinese concept of medicine is based on the modifications of these two energies, either excess or deficiency.
The trips range from the chest to the arms and then the arm to the head then head to feet and feet to the chest according to specific schedules and to solar time.
At a time when the cult of the body is increasingly present, thinness becomes a standard to which many people want to join. Have a lovely figure, stay in shape, hunt overweight ... are the aims Biosband helps you to reach. But the weight is not only an aesthetic criterion, it is also and especially a health vector.*We have made clinical tests of the first V1 on 100 patients
You must continue to feel the tingling feeling for the Biosband to continue working effectively. However, you will become accustomed to the sensation over time, and hence it will become less noticeable. You may also find that the tingling sensation varies as you move your arm around.  Biosband is not water-resistant.
On ""Biosband connect app"" you indicate the schedules of your meals.Just slip it on your wrist, adjust the intensity to suit your individual needs. Cursor power settings enable the wearer to control the level of stimulation and because you can feel it working within minutes, you can adjust the device accordingly with indicator lights showing when it's operating and when the rechargeable  battery is low .  
 Drug free: the Biosband provides relief for craving and helps reduce the appetite without the use of medication by stimulating the median nerve located on the underside of the wrist.
It will not interfere with medications, nor cause drug-related side effects. The Biosband was specifically designed to provide a comfortable level of stimulation enabling the device to be used for long-term, continuous use.
Continuously effective: unlike the pressure bands, where the body quickly adapts to the effect of static pressure, Biosband sends cyclic electronic pulses that provide continual effectiveness for as long as the user has the device turned on.
Usage is easy—just strap it on the underside of your wrist and your smartphone will do the work.
The Biosband is a nerve stimulation connected device that helps to reduce and regulate your appetite. It is a safe, 100 % drug free, highly effective, and clinically proven solution without the side effects associated with medications. The Biosband device generates gentle nerve impulses that travel through the body’s central nervous system to the higher emetic center in the brain.

11. Is the Biosband device FDA approved?


No, not yet. However, we do believe the process of getting FDA approval may be abbreviated. Here's why.The Biosband device does not provide a new treatment. The nerve stimulation treatment has been around and used with FDA approval for years. The Biosband device merely miniaturizes existing machinery into a portable and comfortable format.


We hope, although we obviously cannot guarantee, that the FDA would agree that the device is a constructive modification of an already approved treatment and is willing to approve its use on a timely basis.


Therefore we plan to explore the possibility of an abbreviated approval process known as 510(k) clearance, which would allow us to accelerate approval (months versus years). If this is not feasible, we would pursue the standard Pre-Market Approval route.


We will get there one way or the other .


Do stay in touch with us; we love hearing from you and need you every step of the way, without you none of this would be possible.

</div><div> <h3></h3>Do you know that your energy level is too low, despite endless cups of coffee and energy drinks? Do you hate the inevitable crash they cause? Do you want to feel healthier, stronger and well rested but don’t know how? <br/><p>  Are you interested in finding the perfect vitamin for mornings and evenings? If you answered, “Yes” to any of these questions, you may want to keep reading… </p>
<div>Welcome to the new and improved way to have a healthier more complete life with “EnNeuro”. We developed a process to create a vitamin designed just for you in the morning to get you moving and same for the nighttime. Multivitamins you buy at the store come packed with things your body doesn’t need and misses out on essential nutrients, well not anymore. With our process we have spent 12 years researching exactly what your mind and body needs in the morning and evening, for clarity during the day and peaceful rest at night. “EnNeuro” allows a person to take advantage of a life with optimal health and performance when they are taking the right supplements. <p></p>
<p>Hello! My name is David and I suffer from fatigue, lack of focus, motivation, chronic brain-fog, stress, depression. But I need to feel great everyday in order to be present at work, with my family and friends. Why is this so difficult? I do not want to rely on endless cups of coffee and energy drink just to get through the day… So what is a guy left to do?? </p>
<p>  Invent a safer, more effective alternative to feeling your best each day. Something that can help working professionals, students, entrepreneurs, employees and employers from all walks of life! Something that can invigorate people all over the world… And then…. EnNeuro was born! </p>
<p>Every single year of my life prior to my tenure at junior high, I had always been successful in school, with tons of energy to enjoy the company of my friends after school. I remember distinctively, however, the day in mid junior year, my tests started getting harder, and even more as I progressed into my first year of college; classes and assignments became more complex and deadlines increased the stress. </p>
<p>To make matters worse, I had to get a full time job while pulling over 18 semester credit hours at the same time. When I started searching for solutions and polling my peers I was shocked to find out that many of their routines included: 1) Coffee 3-5/day 2) Energy Drinks 2-7/day 3) Adderall 1-2/day and energy pills 3-6/day. </p>

<p> Coffee, prescription pills and energy drinks were prevalent with people at my job and school, most of these individuals barely even got 4 or 5 hours of sleep which made it even worst and even scary for me, to see that I would have to do the same just to get by and graduate. I started taking lots of different vitamins and trying to relieve stress and achieving REM sleep as quick as possible so I wouldn't have to sleep 8 hours/day but maybe 4 or 5. </p>

</div><p>Another issue was, all the meals most people ate during my college years were fast food and microwavable meals, which even disturbed me more, because I knew that there must have been healthier options to do this to be successful in school. Vitamins started to become my daily nutrition, as well as to counter any negative effects that could deter my efforts to stay focused at work and school. </p><p>Throughout my junior year of college to after graduation, I started playing with single natural ingredients that can help provide rich nutrients to your brain, thus increasing your productivity level without brain fog. I started noticing slight increases of myself being more alert and attentive to tasks at hand. As I climbed the corporate ladder, I noticed that I started working more than normal hours approximately 50 to 70 hours a week, doing many mundane and tedious tasks and meetings. </p><p>I continually sought out more and more natural ingredients and tested them on myself by using multiple blends of the ingredients simultaneously, I had to use the process of elimination over the years to find the perfect blend formulation that worked synergistically without any side effects. I had many friends and peers try my dietary blend with me during this time of discovery, with trials and errors. After painstakingly searching and developing a healthier choice to be a better you, I finally found the perfect blend of nutrients. </p><p>This happened because I was determined to seek a better and healthier alternative to change my life, and since then, it has become my primary source of nutrients to get by in life and be able to think faster, retain memories and stay coherently focused in all situations, at school or work. This has really helped me get promoted many times by being more efficient and productive. Now I want to share this with the world to help others get through the experience I had, or to achieve more than I did, in a healthy way, not sacrificing their health but to redefine normal. I learned you can do it all, simply by nourishing your brain to improve your cognitive function.  </p><p>It took me over 12 years to perfect and develop this cognitive enhancer for you to experience an increase of a healthier and balanced lifestyle without any sacrifice to what you currently do. </p><p></p><div>                                                           <p></p>

<p> Do you take supplements every morning? The numbers are growing. A new government study found that more than half of American adults take at least one dietary supplement. But despite their popularity, many experts remain skeptical of their effects. ""The pill is a nice idea, but we have no reason to think this one-size-fits-all dose makes any sense for each individual,"" said Deen Dr. Darwin Deen, clinical professor in the department of family and social medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. That is why our supplement is perfect, we have specifics components to help give your body what it needs: day and night.</p>

</div><p></p></div>","Do you know that your energy level is too low, despite endless cups of coffee and energy drinks? Do you hate the inevitable crash they cause? Do you want to feel healthier, stronger and well rested but don’t know how?   Are you interested in finding the perfect vitamin for mornings and evenings? If you answered, “Yes” to any of these questions, you may want to keep reading… 
Welcome to the new and improved way to have a healthier more complete life with “EnNeuro”. We developed a process to create a vitamin designed just for you in the morning to get you moving and same for the nighttime. Multivitamins you buy at the store come packed with things your body doesn’t need and misses out on essential nutrients, well not anymore. With our process we have spent 12 years researching exactly what your mind and body needs in the morning and evening, for clarity during the day and peaceful rest at night. “EnNeuro” allows a person to take advantage of a life with optimal health and performance when they are taking the right supplements. 
Hello! My name is David and I suffer from fatigue, lack of focus, motivation, chronic brain-fog, stress, depression. But I need to feel great everyday in order to be present at work, with my family and friends. Why is this so difficult? I do not want to rely on endless cups of coffee and energy drink just to get through the day… So what is a guy left to do?? 
  Invent a safer, more effective alternative to feeling your best each day. Something that can help working professionals, students, entrepreneurs, employees and employers from all walks of life! Something that can invigorate people all over the world… And then…. EnNeuro was born! 
Every single year of my life prior to my tenure at junior high, I had always been successful in school, with tons of energy to enjoy the company of my friends after school. I remember distinctively, however, the day in mid junior year, my tests started getting harder, and even more as I progressed into my first year of college; classes and assignments became more complex and deadlines increased the stress. 
To make matters worse, I had to get a full time job while pulling over 18 semester credit hours at the same time. When I started searching for solutions and polling my peers I was shocked to find out that many of their routines included: 1) Coffee 3-5/day 2) Energy Drinks 2-7/day 3) Adderall 1-2/day and energy pills 3-6/day. 



    


                                                          The Impact: 
 Coffee, prescription pills and energy drinks were prevalent with people at my job and school, most of these individuals barely even got 4 or 5 hours of sleep which made it even worst and even scary for me, to see that I would have to do the same just to get by and graduate. I started taking lots of different vitamins and trying to relieve stress and achieving REM sleep as quick as possible so I wouldn't have to sleep 8 hours/day but maybe 4 or 5. 




Another issue was, all the meals most people ate during my college years were fast food and microwavable meals, which even disturbed me more, because I knew that there must have been healthier options to do this to be successful in school. Vitamins started to become my daily nutrition, as well as to counter any negative effects that could deter my efforts to stay focused at work and school. Throughout my junior year of college to after graduation, I started playing with single natural ingredients that can help provide rich nutrients to your brain, thus increasing your productivity level without brain fog. I started noticing slight increases of myself being more alert and attentive to tasks at hand. As I climbed the corporate ladder, I noticed that I started working more than normal hours approximately 50 to 70 hours a week, doing many mundane and tedious tasks and meetings. I continually sought out more and more natural ingredients and tested them on myself by using multiple blends of the ingredients simultaneously, I had to use the process of elimination over the years to find the perfect blend formulation that worked synergistically without any side effects. I had many friends and peers try my dietary blend with me during this time of discovery, with trials and errors. After painstakingly searching and developing a healthier choice to be a better you, I finally found the perfect blend of nutrients. This happened because I was determined to seek a better and healthier alternative to change my life, and since then, it has become my primary source of nutrients to get by in life and be able to think faster, retain memories and stay coherently focused in all situations, at school or work. This has really helped me get promoted many times by being more efficient and productive. Now I want to share this with the world to help others get through the experience I had, or to achieve more than I did, in a healthy way, not sacrificing their health but to redefine normal. I learned you can do it all, simply by nourishing your brain to improve your cognitive function.  It took me over 12 years to perfect and develop this cognitive enhancer for you to experience an increase of a healthier and balanced lifestyle without any sacrifice to what you currently do.                                                            
                                                           Our Mission
“We provide all-natural supplement products to create a balanced and healthy lifestyle. We also offer unparalleled opportunities for motivated individuals to take control of their future and build the life they have dreamed of.”




 Do you take supplements every morning? The numbers are growing. A new government study found that more than half of American adults take at least one dietary supplement. But despite their popularity, many experts remain skeptical of their effects. ""The pill is a nice idea, but we have no reason to think this one-size-fits-all dose makes any sense for each individual,"" said Deen Dr. Darwin Deen, clinical professor in the department of family and social medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. That is why our supplement is perfect, we have specifics components to help give your body what it needs: day and night.
My product is called EnNeuro for day and night, which is a proprietary formula that works by harnessing dozens of natural and extracted nootriments to synergistically enhance your cognitive function. EnNeuro is a eurogenic that supports memory improvement and mood uplifting by acting as a psycho-stimulant without causing a jitters or a crash later end of the day.

Shawn O'Reilly is a massage
therapist experienced in Swedish, Deep Tissue, and Clinical Massage. He
spent 24 years in the United States Navy as a hospital corpsman and fell in
love with medicine. Towards the end of his career, he started seeing better
results in his patients who were adopting a more holistic approach. Those who
were incorporating massage, yoga, meditation and other complementary modalities
were seeing greater benefits to their overall wellbeing. While he believes
western medicine has a role in health care, he also embraces these other
complementary practices.
                                                                 


As a Massage Therapist, he now has the ability to really invest in his clients and hear their stories. Working together, Shawn and his clients are able to discover the roots of their symptoms and create solutions to manifest true healing,
                                                                                                        
      

Kym Detwiler-O'Reilly is an experienced and certified yoga teacher, with a background in fitness as a personal trainer. Over the past 15 years, she has seen how yoga can help transform people's lives.  
    She also is an Ayurveda Wellness Counselor, guiding individuals with practical information on wellness and disease prevention with an emphasis on nutrition and lifestyle support.

 Ayurveda is the ancient Indian science of life.  Ayurveda and Yoga are sister sciences, they work together and help bring more balance and harmony to the body, mind, and spirit. Ayurveda focuses on the cause of “dis-ease” in the body. According to Ayurveda, going against Nature’s laws, and against our own inner wisdom  are the cause of all disease. The concept with Ayurveda is to get back into balance with our systems and to get back in balance with Nature.


The ancient wisdom of Yoga & Ayurveda are tools to help live a healthy life physically, mentally, emotionally & spiritually.

<p>SPV - <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">a

<p>Why is  SPV - a revolutionary invention, because until now there wasn't any machine that washes wool on ecological way without any detergents, especially not as small as this one for small sheep herders, with this machine they can now wash it themselves and place it on market for better price.</p>
<p>This is 3rd and biggest, so called ""ugly prototype""  which was used for experiments. Experiments showed outstanding results, and the machine is easy to handle and work with.</p>

<p></p>
<p>This invention will enable to sheep herders, and to all others, to wash wool by themselves and have much more benefit from it<span>, also to get better price by selling washed wool instead of selling dirty wool. This machines will </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">considerably help sheep herders and to everyone else, in preserving out planet green.</span></p>

Washing
raw sheep wool is now easy, it can be done without much effort,
hassle and expense for all who want it, you won't have to sell it elsewhere or worry where to store it.


Dirty sheep wool


SPV-5

Washed sheep wool


This wool has been washed on environmentally safe way, without any chemicals or detergents.



We are presenting a new invention which will enable for everyone who bred sheep, or have some other raw wool, to wash it themselves and get higher price for it.
SPV - a
revolutionary invention with a new technique for washing wool, which
does not use any detergent or any chemicals, and water consumption is
0-30 liters per kilogram of wool.


Depending
on the size of the machine or plant that can be built in a variety of
capacities ranging from 5 kilograms onwards.

          

Remenar-Company

Why is  SPV - a revolutionary invention, because until now there wasn't any machine that washes wool on ecological way without any detergents, especially not as small as this one for small sheep herders, with this machine they can now wash it themselves and place it on market for better price.
This is 3rd and biggest, so called ""ugly prototype""  which was used for experiments. Experiments showed outstanding results, and the machine is easy to handle and work with.


WITH TECHNOLOGY OF THIS MACHINE, NOW WE CAN MAKE MACHINES ANY SIZE AND CAPACITY.



Remenar-company in media


This invention will enable to sheep herders, and to all others, to wash wool by themselves and have much more benefit from it, also to get better price by selling washed wool instead of selling dirty wool. This machines will considerably help sheep herders and to everyone else, in preserving out planet green.

Sheep herders - easier storing of wool, better price for washed wool, lanolin + humus and fertilizer.

Increased herding of sheep, which is good for nature and  - additional work places and  development of rural areas.

OR TROWING SLUDGE OF WASHED WOOL, DIRECTLY TO AGRICULTURAL AREA, BECAUSE IT IS GREAT FERTILIZER  



Remenar-Company


Why is  SPV - revolutionary invention, sheep herders will have much more benefit from all wool, even from wool that is not a first class, and usually doesn't even cover the shearing of sheep's.
Our machines will considerably benefit in preserving of the green planet.

- low energy consumption,- no need for chemicals and detergents,
- there is no pollution 
- there is no waste watter, which are expensive and hard to refine


Depending on the
amount of wool it is possible that our machines wash the wool
completely alone and so easily increase profit through:


Achieving
higher prices for wool
Getting

Extra
fertilizer for the land throwing mud from washing the soil or sludge
was mixed with waste and composted sludge, or simply pour the manure.

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Hey world changers! </p>
<p>The Emergency Medical Response Foundation is a public service organization that cares for the people of the world and aims to increase survival rates for EMS organizations all over the world. To achieve this mission, we have both short term and long term goals set based on our core values: professionalism, teamwork, commitment as well as quality, understanding and improvement.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has a reputation for having one of the lowest Cardiac Arrest survival rates in the world at 1%. We'd like to see that change. All hearts beat the same, so where you live shouldn't determine whether or not it can be restarted in an emergency.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>So, we need some stuff to get us going and begin our programs. That stuff is money. Your funds will go towards:</p>
<p>-CPR training for citizens &amp; schools</p>
<p>-School first aid teams</p>
<p>-First responder programs (specifically an app that pings CPR trained citizens to respond to an emergency).</p>
<p>-Advocacy events</p>
<p>-Promotions</p>
<p>-Heart Health Education</p>
<p>-Event First Aid/Consultation</p>
<p>PERKS! We want to give you something in return for helping us out. Check out the side bar to find out what this is.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, that's okay. All our funds will still go into our programs.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Our organization is needed. After doing research, we found there are no other organizations that do exactly what we do. People are dying all around the world, and we need your help to make that stop.</p>
<p>To date, we have used our funds to pay for society registration in Hong Kong, to advocate to the Hong Kong government, and to offer Standard First Aid/CPR/AED courses for over 20 people. We just keep on dreaming, and things keep on happening. World change sits in the palms of our hands; all we have to do is get off our butts, take a risk, and do something.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>One hurdle that EMRF faces is lack of support from the government of Hong Kong. We will continually seek support from local governments and try to influence policy makers to make a greater change. The LegCo in HK has already shown some support for EMRF by publishing one of our letters, and we hope to capitalize on this to continue to progress forward.</p>
<p>Of course, our organization could be a complete flop as well, and slowly die out. However, we have developed an extremely effective strategy &amp; put together highly motivated staff members who are dedicated to the further development of this organization. We have yet to see an organization that focuses so much on this issue and its solutions, so we are sure we are here to stay.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, you can be sure that your funds are being used to invest in life.</p>

</div>","Our
company, TextileScents Inc., is launching our patented invention. An
aromatherapy infusion bag called the ReScenter. For the first time ever, the
ReScenter allows you to re-infuse (re-scent)
any textile product! It’s so easy! You can do it at home in your clothes dryer
for your own aroma-therapeutic spa treatment. 
The first product (more
to follow) included in the ReScenter - is the most luxuriously soft and fluffy
pair of socks on the planet as well as a delightful smelling bottle of all natural
essential oil. This is the first
sock product that actually does something for you, your
feet, your friends and your family!

Each of the four initial scents corresponds
with different colored socks, each delivering too many distinctive
aroma-therapeutic benefits to mention. We have focused on one main benefit each. 



Relax
     with
     Lavender 
     

Focus
     with
     Rosemary 

Energize with Peppermint 


Sleep
     with
     Chamomile 

These scented
socks also provide the added advantage of better smelling feet!                          They even
make your shoes smell great!

Just SPRAY the
inside of the bag with 1-2 squirts of the oil 
                                              
Put the socks in the bag, seal and toss in your TUMBLE
dryer for 5 minutes                                       You
can even ENJOY a personal foot massage as you walk!

If you have a mosquito bite...Dr. Skeeter is on the spot!
SkeeterPaste™ is a completely natural, safe alternative to the over-the-counter chemicals to relieve the annoying itch and associated pain from mosquito bites and other insect stings.
If mosquito bites drive you crazy, you will want to give SkeeterPaste™ a try! For many people it reduces the itching and swelling very quickly, keeping you from scratching and spreading the histamine associated with the sting, which causes it to swell larger and itch worse.

Label Prototypes  My background includes 20+ years of graphic design. I'm an avid outdoorsman and extremely allergic to mosquito bites. I recognized that most people & children experience great discomfort when they are bit by a mosquito, and most readily available relief creams and ointments are made with toxic ingredients that can be very harmful.
We spent a few years in development of the perfect all-natural, safe remedy. Contributors to this campaign will help us achieve our marketing goals of reaching every campground general store in America with a sample and an order form. We want to help stop the itching nationwide!  Mosquitos are basically everywhere. Even with conventional insect repellant sprays, nearly everyone gets bit by a mosquito more than once each year, especially while camping, fishing or enjoying any outdoor activities.


   What We Need & What You Get Our goal is to raise a minimum of $125,000 for:
1) Marketing costs and expenses associated with shipping a sample package to all 25,000+ campgrounds in America. We plan to start there. Once we have contacted all campgrounds, we will seek other sales outlets and pursue retail stores as well.
2) For initial production costs at our lab in New Jersey.
3) For administrative and management costs.
As a benefit, we are offering tubes of SkeeterPaste™ in exchange for donations, along with our organic lip balm, an embroidered Russell Outdoors™ Realtree® Pullover Hooded Sweatshirt, and an Eddie Bauer® Short Sleeve Performance Fishing Shirt for larger donations.

What It Is Not


WARNING! If these chemicals are in your current mosquito relief or repellent products, you and your family could be at a serious risk to your health!
Benzocaine
Moderate to serious side effects of using topical benzocaine are problems breathing or swallowing, swollen tongue or mouth, irregular heartbeat, malaise, body twitching, hypersensitivity, burning, redness, itching and rash.
Another rare but life threatening health risk is the development of methemoglobinemia (MetHb). MetHb is a blood conditions that reduces the ability of red blood cells to deliver oxygen through the body. Symptoms of MetHb are:
- pale or blue-grey skin on lips or nail beds- shortness of breath- fatigue- confusion- headache- lightheadedness- nausea- change of heart rate
Symptoms may appear shortly after exposure to benzocaine or a couple of hours later. In some instances, MetHb can progress to stupor, coma and even death.
Parents and caregivers are warned to use caution when considering use of benzocaine products for their babies, infants and children.
DEA, or diethanolamine
- Carcinogenic; also interacts with nitrites to form a carcinogenic nitrosamine.- One of an estimated 125 ingredients used in home and personal care products that have been proven to cause cancer.

Propylene Glycol
A cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze. In the skin and hair, propylene glycol works as a humescent, which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water. The Material Safety Data Sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage.

Don't go camping or fishing without it.

   Risks & Challenges This project has already come a long way and we believe we are past the most challenging parts. After several iterations we've finalized our designs and identified vendors. We have made prototype molds and received samples. Once funded, we will move from prototype to production molds.

We are currently working on packaging design, confirming production schedule, and lining up all our vendors to converge at our target shipping date.
If we do not reach our funding goal, we will face the challenge of reaching out to individual campgrounds which could take years. We believe we could overcome this challenge by putting together a team to pursue all avenues for sales.
What We Need to raise in this campaign:

We need 125k for raw materials, production costs & initial marketing.
As soon as we hit our goal we will start manufacturing immediately.
If we don't reach our goal we will still invest in bringing SkeeterPaste™ to life.

   Another Way You Can Help If you are unable to contribute at this time, we understand. Please consider sharing this campaign with your friends and family using the Indiegogo share tools.
Thank you in advance!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Any parent who has stayed up with a feverish child can see the genius of a wearable, wireless, continuously monitoring thermometer with instant fever alerts. No more sleepless nights, not to mention the priceless peace of mind. The idea’s actually been on the market for a while, but a quick look at reviews from real families confirms what you suspected . . . that it’s real life usability that counts. The LAST thing you need is another “smart” device or app that creates more hassle than the problem you were trying to solve in the first place. We feel you . . . we’re parents too. That's why we made Temp Pal, the wearable thermometer that anticipates the real life needs of real families like yours. A real life solution--from one parent to another. Meet Temp Pal
Temp Pal anticipates your real family needs.

Easy-to-use. Easy to connect with your smart device; app is simple and intuitive.
Comfortable. Flexible and thin, bends with your body; hypoallergenic.
Reliable. Clinically certified thermometer provides accurate measurements; quick pairing and auto rescan keeps you connected.
Versatile. Perfect for small children, couples trying to get pregnant, elders, post-surgery or chemotherapy patients; reassignable according to your family needs.
Affordable. Rechargeable and reusable; it’s eco- and budget- friendly! 


  
 


 

Accurate Measurement
 

Traditional infrared thermometers are subject to interference from ear wax or other obstructions. Moreover, the probe has to reach deep into the ear canal to get the right temperature. Needless to say, it HURTS. No wonder children squirm!
Temp Pal records body temperature through direct skin contact. Our clinically certified advanced thermal technology integrates hardware and software calibration and takes multiple measurements to obtain precise measurements to within ±0.09℉/ ±0.05℃.      
Bluetooth Connectivity and Local Data Storage       Pairing Temp Pal with a smart device is quick and simple. Temp Pal automatically searches for and connects to your device within seconds; auto rescan keeps you connected. Even if temporarily disconnected, Temp Pal continues to store data locally and keeps trying to reconnect. Moreover, data can be easily retrieved from the cloud if the device is lost or changed.
  
Easy-to-Use App
 


Temp Pal’s companion app is intuitive and displays real-time temperature reading and historical temperature data. The app alerts you when temperature moves beyond a customizable threshold.
 

Reusable, Rechargeable


Typically runs for more than 36 hours on a single charge
Fully recharges in just 2 hours
Designed for continuous, long-term use.
  

Temp Pal does more than just keep track of your kid’s temperature. It’s a versatile health tracking device for the whole family. 
 Continuous, Remote Fever Watch
 

Let Temp Pal keep the fever watch while you sleep or work. Temp Pal gives you real-time, continuous remote access to your loved one's temperature, and instantly alerts you when the temperature reaches a customizable threshold. You and other caregivers can monitor your loved one--or loved ones--at the same time.   Automatic, Accurate BBT and Fertility Charting       Sleep tight and rest easy while Temp Pal takes the hassle out of BBT tracking and fertility charting.  
Temp Pal automatically takes and tracks BBT at a consistent time while you sleep.
Fertility charting feature predicts when you're most likely to conceive.
   
Track Temperature to Stay Healthy       A fever may be the first sign of infection, inflammation, or another serious condition. At certain times, such as flu season, after surgery, or when the immune response is weakened (e.g., during chemotherapy treatment), temperature tracking can be vital. Temp Pal helps you to pick up on any warning signs of serious conditions by monitoring your temperature.       
 

 
Unlike competing products, Temp Pal is:

Reusable
Rechargeable
Easily reassignable according to your ever-changing family needs
Designed for long-term use

It’s so affordable you can get even more than one!  
 Temp Pal is more than just a smart thermometer. It’s a health tracking solution that makes managing real life easier. Alerts, data logs, and monitoring help you stay healthy.  

 
Never Miss a Dose
The Temp Pal app allows you to keep track of your medication and alerts you when it’s time to take your meds.
Secure Health History
Temp Pal stores historical health data in the cloud, and allows users to securely access their encrypted health history. You can keep a profile for each member of your family: add new temperature data, record symptoms, medications taken, and key health events (e.g. vaccinations, physicals, etc.), and share the data with your healthcare provider. With Temp pal, you can keep an ongoing health history for each member of your family in a secure, but easily accessible place.
Group MonitoringIdeal for multiple children, or for daycare centers! Temp Pal supports “many-to-many” temperature monitoring, making it possible to view readings from multiple Temp Pals on multiple devices simultaneously. That is, both parents and other caregivers can view the condition of multiple children at the same time. 
 
 

Setting up Temp Pal is effortless.
Just place Temp Pal in the armpit, and it will automatically measure body temperature continuously, send the readings to smart device via bluetooth, and upload health data to the cloud.Through our cloud service, you will have remote and real-time access to your family's health data and historical logs. You can also share any of the info with your healthcare providers for professional advice. 
  


*Via Cloud Remote Monitoring, both mom and dad can simultaneously care for all the children.
*TempTraq is single-use and disposable, whereas Temp Pal is rechargeable and reusable.

Friction between your body and bed typically requires strenuous actions such as lifting or tossing in order to change position. Comfort Linen minimizes this friction with its unique design thereby allowing you to move with much less effort. After all, you are in bed to relax, sleep and recover from the day's activity - not work out!</p><p>Whether you sleep alone or with another, there is also less disturbance when changing position. This can lead to a more continuous and deeper sleep. Many couples comment on how wonderful it is not to be wakened every time the other person turns over.</p><p>Reports of less pain and stiffness on waking attest to the benefits of gentle and spontaneous movement when Comfort Linen is part of your health plan. Tossing to turn is an action that shouldn't be part of going to bed. We toss as a means to quickly overcome gravity and high levels of friction. Such jostling actions - disruptive to sleep and comfort - are eliminated with the Comfort Linen system helping you relax and drift off to sleep. Comfort Linen takes the toss out of turning.</p><p>We all know how much better we feel after a great sleep. By simply changing your sleep garment and sheet to the Comfort Linen design, you can benefit too!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479479287/wvxdj5m7hzgj3dxhrqih.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>A unique combination of fabrics and grain alignment minimizes binding contact between sleep garment and sheet.  The resulting near friction-free contact facilitates movement when changing position and allows garments to remain comfortably aligned on the body... say goodbye to twisted sleepwear!</p><p><strong><i>Why do I feel stuck in my regular sleepwear and traditional bed linens? </i></strong></p><p><strong><i>Because of stiction!

You will discover how easy moving can be when you try our product. Friction between your body and bed typically requires strenuous actions such as lifting or tossing in order to change position. Comfort Linen minimizes this friction with its unique design thereby allowing you to move with much less effort. After all, you are in bed to relax, sleep and recover from the day's activity - not work out!Whether you sleep alone or with another, there is also less disturbance when changing position. This can lead to a more continuous and deeper sleep. Many couples comment on how wonderful it is not to be wakened every time the other person turns over.Reports of less pain and stiffness on waking attest to the benefits of gentle and spontaneous movement when Comfort Linen is part of your health plan. Tossing to turn is an action that shouldn't be part of going to bed. We toss as a means to quickly overcome gravity and high levels of friction. Such jostling actions - disruptive to sleep and comfort - are eliminated with the Comfort Linen system helping you relax and drift off to sleep. Comfort Linen takes the toss out of turning.We all know how much better we feel after a great sleep. By simply changing your sleep garment and sheet to the Comfort Linen design, you can benefit too!A unique combination of fabrics and grain alignment minimizes binding contact between sleep garment and sheet.  The resulting near friction-free contact facilitates movement when changing position and allows garments to remain comfortably aligned on the body... say goodbye to twisted sleepwear!Why do I feel stuck in my regular sleepwear and traditional bed linens? Because of stiction! (sticking + static friction = stiction)The diagram above illustrates how different interacting fabrics either lock together (high friction) or glide together (low friction). By applying laws of friction to the work of moving in bed, friction in bed-related textiles can be managed. Comfort Linen's technology optimizes levels of friction thereby facilitating repositioning actions, comfort and sleep!We are excited to introduce Comfort Linen's next generation Fitted Sheet featuring our newly created Generation 3 fabric! This specialty satin has been woven more tightly than regular satin and uses finer filaments to improve its longevity. These changes have also resulted in greater friction reduction making it even easier for you to move! Our fitted sheets are available in most bed sizes as listed in the chart below. Satin Pillowslips add an extra touch of luxury and ease the work of positioning pillows when these are used for added support and comfort. Our products are easy-care, fully machine-washable and fast-drying! Comfort Linen's Sleep Garments are made with the latest in performance technical fabrics and are also easy-care, machine washable and fast-drying. Incorporating features appearing in the tag below, our garments - in combination with a Comfort Linen sheet - offer more functional benefits than ever-before possible. Once you choose the PERK that is right for you, we will be asking for your choice of garment style and size. Simply get back to us at that time with your selections from the options and chart below. Below please see ""Other things to keep in mind.""Our Travel Sheet is a simple overlay for easy placement on the fitted sheet of your hotel or guest room bed. It allows you to enjoy the same rest and comfort while away from home. Note that the bottom edge of the Travel Sheet in this photo is turned back to illustrate its lower edge. The side panels are made with the same soft microfibre that surrounds the centre panel of the Fitted Sheet. These panels are long enough to tuck under the mattress helping to stabilize the sheet on the bed. Please note that our product is a system that requires it to be sold initially as a minimum of one sheet and one sleep garment as shown in the selection of our many perks included in this campaign. Once you fall in love with our product and want an additional sheet or garment, simply contact us at info@comfortlinen.com and we will arrange your order. By experiencing Comfort Linen's specific design, you will learn how the ultimate in friction-reducing technology feels. There are simply no better fabric combinations for this purpose than those used in Comfort Linen products. We already know from existing customers that our system is highly effective in achieving better mobility and sleep. Please read on to hear some of the heartfelt comments received from our customers.Although Comfort Linen is simple in principle, we feel that clear and concise information of what the product is - and how it works - needs to be communicated through sound marketing tools and strategies.  Here are some of the initiatives that we plan to undertake after we receive funding:
Development of a new website with global e-commerce capabilities $20,000
Additional staff, including marketing consultants, administration $65,000
Pursue licensing as a therapeutic medical product $10,000
Research into additional product offerings suitable for use in all environments, needs and preferences of users with regards to fabrics, thermoregulating features, designs for style and ease of dressing $5,000
I am so happy with my Comfort Linen sheets and nightgowns - they are life-changing! I feel like I am sleeping in butter and smile to myself whenever I think about sleeping on these sheets. The sheets also benefit my able-bodied husband. The head of our bed is raised and in previously using smooth, shiny sheets to help me - but which has had minimal benefit - my husband would slide down the bed. With the weave of the Comfort Linen sheet being scientifically developed to encourage movement in the direction that benefits turning, my husband wakes up happy too. Thank you Nancy McGovern and Comfort Linen!~Betty, Person with Parkinson'sSince using Comfort Linen, my back pain is practically gone. Getting up from bed in the morning is so much easier. It is a relief not to be uncomfortable rolling around in bed all night - a new mattress wasn't needed after all!~ Lorraine,  A happy seniorI can't believe what a difference Comfort Linen has made in my quality of life! I have Parkinson's and simple things like getting in bed, turning over and finding comfortable sleep positions were becoming more and more difficult. Now with the slightest pressure I am able to turn over with ease. I am actually getting a full night's sleep thanks to your product! ~ Dave, An avid fan My physical therapist told me about Comfort Linen because of my difficulty moving in bed.  I ordered a set and can report: PROBLEM SOLVED!  I can change positions and turn over with almost no effort - and no more twisted garments! Fantastic!~ Phil, Sleeping in the clouds

My first night using Comfort Linen made such a difference. It was unbelievable how I could move with ease without placing stress on my arms as I’d been advised since my cardiac bypass surgery. Thank you so much!
~Sue, A grateful customer
We learned of Comfort Linen from a physiotherapist during a home visit. My husband, who has Parkinson's, shared that he found moving in bed very difficult.

<p>These are just some of the reasons why babies are left and forgotten in cars. And they are just some of the reasons why babies die because they have been left there.</p>
<p><b>For these reasons and many others, we have decided that the time had come to do something. We now propose an innovative and user-friendly solution that can finally stop these tragedies.</b></p>
<p>We were impressed when we discovered that no big multinationals have ever proposed some products that could have prevented babies’ deaths due to vehicular heat strokes. Probably, according to them, the accidents were so few, it was not worth it to invest in a solution that would have required time, personnel and costs. But we do not think the same.</p>
<p><b>Even just one accident per year requires attention as well as a solution.</b> <b>Since this accident represents the life of a baby.</b></p>

<p><b>Our company: </b>our project started few months ago, when Claudio heard about the story of Gioia, a 17 months old girl, who died due to a heat stroke, because she has been left alone in a car. This little girl, as many others, died because of a tragic carelessness by her parents. Before dying, she spent several hours alone on her baby car seat, with an external temperature of 40 degrees. Gioia had beautiful parents, but unfortunately <b>something went wrong on that day.</b></p>
<p>It was in that moment that Claudio started to learn more about the problem of babies forgotten in cars. Accordingly, he started to develop a feasible solution to these tragic deaths. In few months, Benedetta and Luisa joined the team, leveraging their own skills, resources and energies in order to <b>make the difference</b>. </p>
<p>From that moment the project has become something more than an idea: in the end we have created Don-Go, a device that aims at increasing safety in families’ daily routines.</p>

</div></div>","Did you know that hundreds of children die every year in cars because their parents forget them there for a few minutes. If we told you that built some technology that will prevent this from happening ever again, would you support us? Watch our video!













Don-Go is a wireless scale device that allows parents to monitor their baby directly from their smartphone. In order to use Don-Go, parents just have to equip the baby seat with our device and to download our free app.


 Don-Go has to be placed under the removable pillow of the baby-seat. Since every baby-seats are equipped with removable pillows, Don-Go can be utilised with any baby-seat’s brand. 












Every year, more than 2000 babies are left in hot cars by their parents and sometimes the consequences of these actions are tragic.









We know it will never happen to you but we also know that those people to whom these tragedies happen, are not bad parents. Normal people will never be able to explain what it is, but doctors can. They call it “temporary blackout” and apparently it can happen to anyone. As any problem, this sort of amnesia needs a sensible solution. Since it’s not parents' fault. History has thought us something: with harsh critics and avoidance, people will never achieve anything. People need to be understood and listened. They need respect. And this is what we are trying to do.
Have you ever left your baby alone in a car for 5 minutes while you were going to the grocery store? Have you ever forgotten where you parked your car? Did you ever receive an unexpected call while you were bringing your child to school? These can be all causes of fatal death due to heat stroke.






These are just some of the reasons why babies are left and forgotten in cars. And they are just some of the reasons why babies die because they have been left there.
For these reasons and many others, we have decided that the time had come to do something. We now propose an innovative and user-friendly solution that can finally stop these tragedies.
We were impressed when we discovered that no big multinationals have ever proposed some products that could have prevented babies’ deaths due to vehicular heat strokes. Probably, according to them, the accidents were so few, it was not worth it to invest in a solution that would have required time, personnel and costs. But we do not think the same.
Even just one accident per year requires attention as well as a solution. Since this accident represents the life of a baby.

<h2>!!!UPPDATERING 9 Oktober!!</h2>
<p><strong>Vi har varit otydliga i en viktig del för er. Vad kommer det att kosta att träna på boxen?</strong></p>
<p>Vi lägger upp de tänkta priserna för det olika uppläggen vi kommer att ha, så har ni något att jämföra med. ( anledningen till att det står € istället för kronor är helt enkelt att systemet inte hanterar svensk valuta)</p>
<p>Tanken kring våra medlemskap är att man ska kunna skräddarsy sitt kort, så att det passar er vardag och  ni inte behöver betala för något ni inte kommer att dra nytta av. </p>
<p>Vår största utgift är personalkostnader (dvs alla pass som leds av instruktör) Så vi har försökt att skala av så mycket det går i de olika alternativen på korten. </p>
<h3>Introduktionskurser</h3>
<p><strong>(6 veckor 2 ggr/Veckan)</strong></p>
<p>Introkursen kommer kosta 1400:- om man endast vill den utan något medlemskap.</p>
<p>Skulle man vilja teckna ett månadskort eller autogiro samtidigt så kostar introkursen 800:-</p>
<h3>Autogiro</h3>
<p>Tecknar man sig på autogiro så kommer man få lägre pris än månadskortet. 80-100:-/lägre pris.</p>
<h3>Student/Senior/Junior</h3>
<p>Studenter (15-18) /Seniorer (65+) kommer ha ca 20% rabatt på medlemskapen.</p>

<h3>CrossFit Oskarshamn</h3>
<p>Vi har varit en förening sedan 2014 och tar nu klivet upp för att utöka vår verksamhet. Vi saknar dock de ekonomiska musklerna för att klara det själva, då vi är eldsjälar som sett till att föreningen varit aktiv.</p>
<p>Målet har alltid varit att ge oskarshamnarna en bra möjlighet att få effekt av sin träning, inte bara köpa ett gymkort som sedan samlar damm och att resultaten uteblir.</p>
<p>Föreningen har alltid haft en kamp för att få de få de bokningstider vi velat ha, och slitaget på utrustningen vi tillhandahållit, har nyttjats av andra föreningar utan att de hjälp oss att driva vår box framåt.  Så nu tar vi steget och flyttar boxen till nya lokaler på 150Kvm. Högt i tak och ny utrustning, dock saknar vi en pusselbit. Golvet.</p>
<p>Golvet är den sista pusselbiten för att vi ska kunna köra igång verksamheten fullt ut.</p>
<p>Tanken är erbjuda medlemmar träning, på de tider de vill ha samt lyfta kunskapen om hur hälsofrämjande fysisk aktivitet faktiskt är. Vi kommer att träna upp.. eller rättare sagt lära upp medlemmarna i träning, så de kan stå på egna ben och känna sig trygga i allt de gör innanför och utanför boxen. </p>

<h3>Vad vill vi ha hjälp med?</h3>
<p>Vi behöver ett nytt golv till vår lokal på 150kvm. Priset på golvet är runt 7.000€ (ca 67.000:-Skr )</p>

</div></div>","!!!UPPDATERING 9 Oktober!!
Vi har varit otydliga i en viktig del för er. Vad kommer det att kosta att träna på boxen?
Vi lägger upp de tänkta priserna för det olika uppläggen vi kommer att ha, så har ni något att jämföra med. ( anledningen till att det står € istället för kronor är helt enkelt att systemet inte hanterar svensk valuta)
Tanken kring våra medlemskap är att man ska kunna skräddarsy sitt kort, så att det passar er vardag och  ni inte behöver betala för något ni inte kommer att dra nytta av. 
Vår största utgift är personalkostnader (dvs alla pass som leds av instruktör) Så vi har försökt att skala av så mycket det går i de olika alternativen på korten. 
Introduktionskurser
(6 veckor 2 ggr/Veckan)
Introkursen kommer kosta 1400:- om man endast vill den utan något medlemskap.
Skulle man vilja teckna ett månadskort eller autogiro samtidigt så kostar introkursen 800:-
Autogiro
Tecknar man sig på autogiro så kommer man få lägre pris än månadskortet. 80-100:-/lägre pris.
Student/Senior/Junior
Studenter (15-18) /Seniorer (65+) kommer ha ca 20% rabatt på medlemskapen.
Juniorer (10-4) kommer ha upp till 50% rabatt på priserna som gäller. (Juniorer tränar med målsman tills de tagit ""träningskörkort"")
Bonus
När man tecknar 12 månaders autogiro så kommer man kunna få en bonus om man värvar en kompis. För varje kompis man värvar får man en fri månad. (Dvs. en kompis man värvar en månad gratis, 12 kompisar blir ett år gratis, osv. )

A therapeutic vaccine, on the other hand, is used after onset of the disease (cancer in our case) and is used to treat the disease.</p><p><strong>Q: What is a personalized cancer vaccine?</strong><br/>A: A personalized cancer vaccine is a therapeutic vaccine that is manufactured using the patient’s own tumor material and hence is specific (personalized) to the patient’s own cancer.</p><p><strong>Q: What is the vaccine made of and is it natural?</strong><br/>A: Our therapeutic cancer vaccine is made up of three components: 1. Proteins from the patient’s own cancerous cells, 2. An immune system stimulating protein (called human Interleukin-2, that activates the cells of the immune system to fight cancer cells) and 3. An inactive pharmaceutical ingredient (a phosphate rich lipid). The first component is the only natural ingredient out of the three. </p><p><strong>Q: What is the active ingredient in the vaccine?</strong><br/>A: There are two active pharmaceutical ingredients in our vaccine, 1. Proteins from the patient’s own cancer cells and 2.

</h3></div>","Recent Patient testimonial: “...I am just so thankful that the vaccine has kept me going and I just hope that it’s more available to other people to save their lives. It is a godsend...” (16 year + disease-free survival)Our vaccination therapy is quick to produce and safe to administer to a patient. A small sample of the patient’s tumor is taken by a physician and sent to our laboratory. Here we manufacture the vaccine by combining the patient’s tumor cell material with a powerful human immune stimulator Interleukin 2 (IL-2), to create billions of individual slow release Aggregon™ particles. These particles, when injected by the physician back into the patient from whom the tumor was extracted, will directly stimulate their immune system to recognize and attack their specific tumor cells.A patient’s immune system tends to ignore cancer cells because they are made mostly of self-proteins. However, in the process of becoming malignant, cancer cells acquire mutated parts foreign enough that we can use them as a target for attack by our therapeutic vaccine.The use of IL-2 to stimulate an anti-tumor immune response has been an FDA approved cancer therapy for years. However, when IL-2 alone is injected into the body it is eliminated quickly, which requires the use of very high toxic doses to be effective.Our AggregonTM technology allows us to deliver the benefits of IL-2 in a personalized vaccine containing material from the patient’s own cancer cells in a non-toxic formulation. This formulation gently educates the patient’s immune system to identify and attack their cancer cells everywhere throughout their body.Working in our manufacturing facilityOur cancer vaccine has already indicated efficacy in harnessing the immune system to combat cancer in two previous phase one clinical trials. These trials were performed at the National Cancer Institute in patients with Follicular Lymphoma. The vaccine showed no significant toxicity and the long-term benefits were very encouraging.  A XEME scientist working in the clean room cancer vaccine manufacturing facility in Lombard, IL The following graph represents the results of one of our first clinical trial in Lymphoma. Here, patients were first administered standard chemotherapy followed by a period of recovery for the immune system. These patients were then vaccinated with our non-toxic, personalized therapeutic vaccine. The data suggests that, for most patients, their immune system helped to keep them cancer free much longer than the expected relapse time after chemotherapy alone (orange vertical bars in the figure below). This encouraging data has inspired us to continue to gather more evidence to prove the effectiveness of our immunotherapy even in patients with a weakened immune systems.Abbreviations: PR – Partial response; CCR – Continuous complete remission; PD – Progressive disease. See http://www.xemebiopharma.com for more details.We are currently engaged in an ongoing clinical trial in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) at Northwestern University in Chicago. For many patients CLL is a slow progressing cancer and patients often do not suffer from any symptoms of their disease until it is very advanced. Current therapies for CLL have toxic side effects. As a result, the standard of care is to ""watch and wait"", and start the treatment only when the patient becomes symptomatic.XEME’s quality control lab in Lombard, ILOur treatment is so gentle that we have been allowed to treat asymptomatic patients with CLL. Our goal is to postpone, as long as possible or even indefinitely, the progression of their disease and the need for more aggressive therapies. This is considered  by the FDA a “first in human” trial for CLL.Loading vaccine samples in a high pressure liquid chromatography instrumentIf successful, our new anti-cancer vaccine could improve the quality of life for many people and become the new standard of care. We plan to extend our research to follicular lymphoma and other forms of cancers in order to help as many patients as we can.As you would expect, clinical trials are very expensive, and we have nearly exhausted our limited resources to reach this advanced clinical stage. Therefore, your help is critical to continue our clinical trials. Please help us in our endeavor to offer patients our unique, safe and affordable therapy.Perks Frequently Asked QuestionsQ: What is the difference between a therapeutic cancer vaccine and a regular flu vaccine?A: A regular flu vaccine is a preventative vaccine (prophylactic), minimizing the chance of one getting the flu. A therapeutic vaccine, on the other hand, is used after onset of the disease (cancer in our case) and is used to treat the disease.Q: What is a personalized cancer vaccine?A: A personalized cancer vaccine is a therapeutic vaccine that is manufactured using the patient’s own tumor material and hence is specific (personalized) to the patient’s own cancer.Q: What is the vaccine made of and is it natural?A: Our therapeutic cancer vaccine is made up of three components: 1. Proteins from the patient’s own cancerous cells, 2. An immune system stimulating protein (called human Interleukin-2, that activates the cells of the immune system to fight cancer cells) and 3. An inactive pharmaceutical ingredient (a phosphate rich lipid). The first component is the only natural ingredient out of the three. Q: What is the active ingredient in the vaccine?A: There are two active pharmaceutical ingredients in our vaccine, 1. Proteins from the patient’s own cancer cells and 2. The immune system stimulating protein, human Interleukin-2.Q: What is the size of the tumor sample needed to make a vaccine?A: This depends on how many cancer cells are present in the tissue. Typically, a tumor biopsy of 0.5 gram – 2 grams is sufficient for manufacturing the vaccine. In the case of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia patients, a billion tumor cells are more than enough for vaccine manufacturing; this number is easy to obtain.Q: Can you make a vaccine from a biopsy sample?A: Yes, in most cases we can; Typically a tumor biopsy of 0.5 gram – 2 grams in more than sufficient for manufacturing the vaccine.Q: How long does it take to make a vaccine?A: One of the unique attributes of our vaccine is the rapid manufacturing process (around 9 hours).

It also shines a light on how difficult it is right now for patients to get good information on compassionate use.</p><p><strong>GAVIN VS. “JOE BULLY”</strong><br/>In 2012, doctors told Nicole and Steve Pierson that their five-year-old Gavin had a teratoma (tumor) in his brain. Standard treatment for growing teratoma syndrome included chemotherapy and surgically removing the tumor, but the doctors could not fully remove the tumor without fatal damage to Gavin’s brain. So, Gavin had craniotomy after craniotomy to remove as much of the tumor as possible and keep up with new growth.</p><p>Gavin named his tumor “Joe Bully” and told his family he and his doctors were going to beat Joe Bully.</p><p><strong>A MOTHER TAKES ACTION</strong><br/>In the meantime, Nicole understood that the unending series of craniotomies would only extend Gavin’s life for so long—and that the damage and the recovery from each surgery was harder and harder for Gavin.</p><p>In her desperate nighttime research, she learned of an experimental drug by Pfizer was showing success in stopping teratoma growth in some adults. But Pfizer said that Gavin was too young to participate in the clinical trial. They said they might run a pediatric trial the next year. Everything Gavin endured thereafter was to keep him alive in hopes that he’d make it to that clinical trial.</p><p><strong>THE WORST NEWS</strong><br/>At Christmas, Gavin’s tumor started growing very rapidly. Gavin only had a couple months to live. His doctors called Pfizer again, hoping the pediatric trial might be ready to go. The pediatric trial was too far off to help Gavin.</p><p>Only then did Gavin’s doctors and Pfizer raise compassionate use as an option, telling Nicole that compassionate use was a way to access experimental treatments when no standard treatment or clinical trial options remained. In the six months after they knew that standard care would not save Gavin, no one had ever told her about compassionate use.</p><p><strong>COMPASSIONATE USE</strong><br/>Gavin was fortunate. Pfizer said YES and gave Gavin compassionate use of the experimental drug. Even more fortunate, the drug <u>worked</u>. It stopped the tumor growth, keeping Gavin stable until a new innovative laser was available to treat the rest of Joe Bully.</p><p><strong>“WE WERE LUCKY, AND THAT SHOULDN’T BE”</strong><br/>Today, Gavin’s YES from a drug company is the exception.</p><p>And even so, these days Nicole talks to drug companies and to doctors to emphasize that they need to explain compassionate use (and other stages of investigational treatment access) to patients far earlier in the treatment process. In Gavin’s case, it was clear that standard care would not save Gavin’s life after his first craniotomy. She asks why she was not told of the possibility of compassionate use until six months and three more craniotomies?</p><p>Nicole’s message to drug companies: “I feel that we just fell upon it, and we are lucky. And that shouldn’t be. If you could just say, Yes, you can try this drug, and it might not cure you, but you can try it.”</p><p>Gavin was declared cancer-free in June, 2016.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480286095/ob4hbl4ksf5xm4npqgl3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>To learn more</strong> about Gavin’s story: Gavin has an <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/gavinsarmy.pierson"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">army of supporters on Facebook</a>, and Nicole recently published a memoir of Gavin’s journey, “<a href=""https://bestrongandbrave.org/book/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Be Strong and Brave</a>.”</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479950982/tiivlfwisvnm1xvfqrha.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477894116/ioxczgzsf8ywewnoifxx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Patients face two problems when  seeking compassionate use: (1) a NO from the drug company and (2) little to no useful resources to help them ask the drug companies for compassionate use.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477906276/e2yethqkzv1j3ihzxeat.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><p>The government now has a solid compassionate use program, but before a patient can ask the government to approve compassionate use, the drug company first has to say “YES, we will allow compassionate use of our experimental drug.” Instead, patients usually receive a NO.</p><p>For patients and their doctors, getting the drug company to say YES feels like a hit-or-miss process of reaching the right executive at the right company at the right time for the right disease.

These barriers and disincentives can include:</p><ul>
<li>Financial—Smaller companies, often the developers of cutting-edge treatments, might be cash strapped and unable to divert funds from clinical trials</li>
<li>Profit—Companies are not allowed to profit from compassionate use</li>
<li>Regulatory—Some companies are concerned that a harmful side effect in a compassionate use case may give government regulators reason to deny approval of the drug</li>
<li>Human Resources &amp; In-House Knowledge—Some smaller companies do not know how to conduct compassionate use and/or cannot afford the additional staff to manage it</li>
<li>Manufacturing—Sometimes a drug company has challenges supplying its clinical trials with the drug and cannot spare drug supplies for compassionate use</li>
<li>Cultural—Some drug companies have not made the decision—yet—that  from the top-down their company will make compassionate use work for the patient when it is medically appropriate and logistically possible</li>
</ul><p>We strongly believe that there are practical win-win solutions to lower or eliminate many of these barriers. Some solutions are already at our fingertips. Others can be built with a willingness to work together. CURe will make that work happen with Solution Hub.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why would drug companies be interested in finding solutions to make compassionate use work?</strong></p><p>First, drug companies are made up of people, many who want to help other people. Some drug company employees have fought doggedly inside their companies for compassionate use and have been deeply saddened and frustrated when their companies say no. There is a mountain of good will working within the drug development industry, and we want to leverage that for the good of patients and their families.</p><p>Second, social media and press spotlights have turned up the pressure on drug companies to improve their compassionate use records and to play a leading role in making compassionate use work for patients.</p><p>A few companies have taken notable steps to improve their compassionate use process. For example, in 2015 <a href=""http://www.jnj.com/news/all/Johnson-Johnson-Announces-NYU-School-of-Medicine-Partnership-to-Evaluate-Compassionate-Use-of-Investigational-Medicines"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Johnson &amp; Johnson announced</a> that they would work with NYU School of Medicine to pilot an external committee to fairly determine which patients should receive compassionate use of a limited supply of one experimental drug. This year the company decided to expand the program to cover all of its experimental medical products. It’s a good start.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Is government the problem?</strong></p><p>Our short answer: No.</p><p>In the U.S., FDA has a strong compassionate use program that is medically sensible, appropriate for the greater public good, and compassionate towards patients. But until drug companies improve their compassionate use participation, patients and doctors cannot use the FDA program to its full potential.</p><p>Government still has an important problem-solving role to play. To lower the barriers that drug companies face , we need government participation in building win-win solutions that will work in current and future regulatory environments.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Is it ethical to provide compassionate use to patients when the medical treatments are not fully tested and proven effective?</strong></p><p>The ethics of compassionate use have been a serious discussion since the inception of compassionate use programs.</p><p>The big question is whether it is ethical to administer experimental drugs to patients before we know if the drugs are effective and before we understand the full set of risks associated with the drug. <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/14656566.2015.1046837#aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YW5kZm9ubGluZS5jb20vZG9pL3BkZi8xMC4xNTE3LzE0NjU2NTY2LjIwMTUuMTA0NjgzNz9uZWVkQWNjZXNzPXRydWVAQEAw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">This article</a> provides a good summary of the history of the ethics discussion. Lawmakers in many countries have determined that compassionate use is acceptable, given the following conditions:</p><ul>
<li>The patient has exhausted other comparable treatment options before trying an experimental drug</li>
<li>The risks to the patient are deemed no greater than those of not using the experimental drug</li>
<li>The patient (or patient’s guardian) gives informed consent — i.e., the patient receives a full explanation of the treatment and associated risks and benefits, and the patient then chooses to go forward with the treatment</li>
<li>Compassionate use of the drug does not interfere with completion of clinical trials of the drug which benefit the longer term good of future patients</li>

Most patients hear NO.We saw our friends’ families devastated by NO, denied the chance to fight to live. We started CURe (Compassionate Use Reform) to make compassionate use work for patients and their families.We need your help to launch CURe’s two core programs::INFO HUB—an online guide to help patients and families navigate the compassionate use processSOLUTION HUB—CURe will collaborate with patients, drug companies, doctors, and government to build practical, win-win solutions to get drug companies to YESThis problem is solvable. Let’s solve it.Help us raise the $40,000 to launch Info Hub.How can CURe change lives? Gavin Pierson’s story shows us  just what compassionate use can mean to one little boy who is alive today and growing up against all odds. (watch the video!)Right now, Gavin’s YES story is the exception. Let’s make that YES the usual story.Join us with a $25 contribution. SAY YES. Gavin’s story show how a compassionate use YES gives a family the hope to keep fighting and, in some cases, keeps a family whole. It also shines a light on how difficult it is right now for patients to get good information on compassionate use.GAVIN VS. “JOE BULLY”In 2012, doctors told Nicole and Steve Pierson that their five-year-old Gavin had a teratoma (tumor) in his brain. Standard treatment for growing teratoma syndrome included chemotherapy and surgically removing the tumor, but the doctors could not fully remove the tumor without fatal damage to Gavin’s brain. So, Gavin had craniotomy after craniotomy to remove as much of the tumor as possible and keep up with new growth.Gavin named his tumor “Joe Bully” and told his family he and his doctors were going to beat Joe Bully.A MOTHER TAKES ACTIONIn the meantime, Nicole understood that the unending series of craniotomies would only extend Gavin’s life for so long—and that the damage and the recovery from each surgery was harder and harder for Gavin.In her desperate nighttime research, she learned of an experimental drug by Pfizer was showing success in stopping teratoma growth in some adults. But Pfizer said that Gavin was too young to participate in the clinical trial. They said they might run a pediatric trial the next year. Everything Gavin endured thereafter was to keep him alive in hopes that he’d make it to that clinical trial.THE WORST NEWSAt Christmas, Gavin’s tumor started growing very rapidly. Gavin only had a couple months to live. His doctors called Pfizer again, hoping the pediatric trial might be ready to go. The pediatric trial was too far off to help Gavin.Only then did Gavin’s doctors and Pfizer raise compassionate use as an option, telling Nicole that compassionate use was a way to access experimental treatments when no standard treatment or clinical trial options remained. In the six months after they knew that standard care would not save Gavin, no one had ever told her about compassionate use.COMPASSIONATE USEGavin was fortunate. Pfizer said YES and gave Gavin compassionate use of the experimental drug. Even more fortunate, the drug worked. It stopped the tumor growth, keeping Gavin stable until a new innovative laser was available to treat the rest of Joe Bully.“WE WERE LUCKY, AND THAT SHOULDN’T BE”Today, Gavin’s YES from a drug company is the exception.And even so, these days Nicole talks to drug companies and to doctors to emphasize that they need to explain compassionate use (and other stages of investigational treatment access) to patients far earlier in the treatment process. In Gavin’s case, it was clear that standard care would not save Gavin’s life after his first craniotomy. She asks why she was not told of the possibility of compassionate use until six months and three more craniotomies?Nicole’s message to drug companies: “I feel that we just fell upon it, and we are lucky. And that shouldn’t be. If you could just say, Yes, you can try this drug, and it might not cure you, but you can try it.”Gavin was declared cancer-free in June, 2016.To learn more about Gavin’s story: Gavin has an army of supporters on Facebook, and Nicole recently published a memoir of Gavin’s journey, “Be Strong and Brave.” Patients face two problems when  seeking compassionate use: (1) a NO from the drug company and (2) little to no useful resources to help them ask the drug companies for compassionate use.The government now has a solid compassionate use program, but before a patient can ask the government to approve compassionate use, the drug company first has to say “YES, we will allow compassionate use of our experimental drug.” Instead, patients usually receive a NO.For patients and their doctors, getting the drug company to say YES feels like a hit-or-miss process of reaching the right executive at the right company at the right time for the right disease. AND THAT’S NOT RIGHT.If that weren’t difficult enough, there are very few resources that explain to patients (and to doctors) how to request compassionate use. Even less information is out there about the hard, confusing, and often frustrating part: asking a drug company for compassionate use. The resources that do exist are not written or designed for patients and families who are sick, emotionally strained, tired, stressed, and critically pressed for time. No one knows the number of patients seeking compassionate use from drug companies each year. The requests that receive “NO” from a drug company generally go unrecorded.The U.S. FDA receives on average 1,210 requests each year and approved 99% of those requests. Unfortunately, FDA data tell us nothing about the actual number of people who asked drug companies and received a NO, because FDA does not accept formal requests until after a drug company says YES.What we do know is that the number of people who ask drug companies for compassionate use is bigger—much bigger—than the number of drug company YES's effectively recorded by FDA.  #1— We’re starting with CURe INFO HUB.

Cultural—Some drug companies have not made the decision—yet—that  from the top-down their company will make compassionate use work for the patient when it is medically appropriate and logistically possible
We strongly believe that there are practical win-win solutions to lower or eliminate many of these barriers. Some solutions are already at our fingertips. Others can be built with a willingness to work together. CURe will make that work happen with Solution Hub. Why would drug companies be interested in finding solutions to make compassionate use work?First, drug companies are made up of people, many who want to help other people. Some drug company employees have fought doggedly inside their companies for compassionate use and have been deeply saddened and frustrated when their companies say no. There is a mountain of good will working within the drug development industry, and we want to leverage that for the good of patients and their families.Second, social media and press spotlights have turned up the pressure on drug companies to improve their compassionate use records and to play a leading role in making compassionate use work for patients.A few companies have taken notable steps to improve their compassionate use process. For example, in 2015 Johnson & Johnson announced that they would work with NYU School of Medicine to pilot an external committee to fairly determine which patients should receive compassionate use of a limited supply of one experimental drug. This year the company decided to expand the program to cover all of its experimental medical products. It’s a good start. Is government the problem?Our short answer: No.In the U.S., FDA has a strong compassionate use program that is medically sensible, appropriate for the greater public good, and compassionate towards patients. But until drug companies improve their compassionate use participation, patients and doctors cannot use the FDA program to its full potential.Government still has an important problem-solving role to play. To lower the barriers that drug companies face , we need government participation in building win-win solutions that will work in current and future regulatory environments. Is it ethical to provide compassionate use to patients when the medical treatments are not fully tested and proven effective?The ethics of compassionate use have been a serious discussion since the inception of compassionate use programs.The big question is whether it is ethical to administer experimental drugs to patients before we know if the drugs are effective and before we understand the full set of risks associated with the drug. This article provides a good summary of the history of the ethics discussion. Lawmakers in many countries have determined that compassionate use is acceptable, given the following conditions:
The patient has exhausted other comparable treatment options before trying an experimental drug
The risks to the patient are deemed no greater than those of not using the experimental drug
The patient (or patient’s guardian) gives informed consent — i.e., the patient receives a full explanation of the treatment and associated risks and benefits, and the patient then chooses to go forward with the treatment
Compassionate use of the drug does not interfere with completion of clinical trials of the drug which benefit the longer term good of future patients
Visit NYU School of Medicine Working Group on Compassionate Use and Pre-Approval Access to read more about the ethics questions compassionate use stakeholders continue to discuss. __________________________________________________________________CURe is a registered 501(c)(3) charity recognized by the United States IRS.Website: www.compassionateusereform.orgLike CURe on Facebook ● Follow CURe on Twitter",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>CUPPA grips to all flat smooth surfaces. Your home or office desk, your kitchen top, your dinner table.</p>
<p>No more accidents with wet documents or items, or bad spills and stains on your clothing or surfaces.                  </p>
<p>Our creative coaster vacuum bottom of the cup creates the Cup to lock onto any flat smooth clean surface you put it on.</p>
<p>It then prevents accidents and it being knocked over but the coaster suction vacuum is released easily when you lift it straight up to take a drink.</p>
<p>Our unique CUPPA Cup works when air is trapped beneath it when placed down creating a vacuum and is remarkably strong.</p>
<p>Push it again and again and it will not fall over, but release it and releases easily with no effort and lifts up naturally.</p>

</div></div>","Drinking Well By Colour THE ONLY CUP YOU CANNOT  KNOCK, PUNCH or PUSH Over!


At Work and in meetings,
protect your computer and documents.
At Home and at Play Cuppa
Cup prevents accidents and spills while you   are busy doing your chores, take
time out, relax and have your favourite CUPPA – no spills, only thrills. 
                                               HAVE OUR ""CUPPA"" 
         How many
times, time after time has this happened
to you?  
You
accidentally knock a Cup full of Water or Coffee , Drinks, Smoothies and Tea as
well as any liquid spills all over the place? 

Even
worse someone else knocks it over at Work or at Home all over your documents.  Watch out there goes your laptop computer,
ipad or iphone. There goes all your work and effort.
Worse still
your children or elderly parent knocks their cup over and you have to clean it
all up.  
Well,
that is why we went searching for a solution to put a stop to all the careless
accidents, mess and clean ups. 

                           NON SPILL CUP THAT WILL NOT FALL OVER

                                

CUPPA grips to all flat smooth surfaces. Your home or office desk, your kitchen top, your dinner table.
No more accidents with wet documents or items, or bad spills and stains on your clothing or surfaces.                  
Our creative coaster vacuum bottom of the cup creates the Cup to lock onto any flat smooth clean surface you put it on.
It then prevents accidents and it being knocked over but the coaster suction vacuum is released easily when you lift it straight up to take a drink.
Our unique CUPPA Cup works when air is trapped beneath it when placed down creating a vacuum and is remarkably strong.
Push it again and again and it will not fall over, but release it and releases easily with no effort and lifts up naturally.
No more
need for coasters.


Now you
can get rid of your old cup and replace it and  have our CUPPA Cup!  
Our in
built coaster is an extra bonus with our CUPPA Cup. No more need for and say
goodbye to those coasters. 

For extra
protection our sealed top lid. Put it on and it keeps your drinks colder for
longer and hotter for longer.

<h3><strong>NEWS FROM NEUROPLANNER!</strong></h3>
<p>To cap the year, we are currently at 66% funding goal with over 225 active neuroplanners.  We've closed the year on a high being featured in BetaList (home of startups on beta) and an exhibition at the MAAD Event or Market of Artists and Designers hosted by the Red Dot Museum Singapore towards the NYE countdown.  January is sustaining our highs as we got featured as the <a href=""https://medium.com/@BetaList/startups-of-december-80898afac8f4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">top 10 startups in Beta Last last December</a>, we're planning to camp at the iLight Marina Bay, we're exhibiting at National Gallery Singapore's Light to Night Festival around Padang, we're having a booth at Katong Square's Lifestyle and Vintage Market by RetroFactory, and will be out on retail for the first time at <a href=""https://wtpstore.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We The People Singapore</a> (the official home of funded Kickstarter projects).  While we absolutely don't have time for marketing (being a one-woman team), we are in the midst of launching 1 project this January and is currently prototyping a second one for a launch within Q1 2018.  If you contribute now at Indiegogo, you get to enjoy the same non-retail (yet) rates as well as shipping every week. </p>

<p>It's the first week of the year and you've ticked most of your goals.  You've eaten right, learned how to code, and been going to the gym.  Then, you went missing.  Three weeks later, your friends find you deep into the season finale of a 7-part series that you only started 3 days ago with pizzas and nachos spread on your couch.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Sounds like you? </h3>
<p>Every year you make a promise to yourself that you'll finally get that promotion or at least make time for your crocheting. But down the road in 2 weeks or 6 months, you stray.  You then start some existential crisis questions over a bottle of red either with friends or in front of a mirror, upside-down naked.  You rack your brain for motivation, clarity, and focus but you felt bled out from boredom, tiredness, and stress.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Fret not.  You are not alone. </h3>
<p>There are many of us who seems not to be as energized as our marathon finisher colleagues or who-seem-to-have-achieve-it-all friends.  I can say for sure that you are not mental and that you've come to the right place.   You only need to know how to hack your brain to finally make it work alongside you - together in achieving goals, and not how you usually think it does: against it. </p> <h2>Time for a brain workout.   </h2>

<p>Exploring your brain's capacity takes time as that is how our minds work: they thrive in the slow.  That is why when you take drastic changes (does new year resolutions ring a bell?), it usually does not work out in the long term.  Taking time to learn and practice is key to changing your habits.  So we've designed a year-long planner that gets you through these vital life themes:</p>

<p>Each week, you'll learn basic neuroscience concepts and evidence-based techniques that will put your life back in order.  You'll finally stop beating yourself up for things you thought are your fault but, in fact, you can do better.  Most importantly, you'll make an amazing discovery on how to make yourself happy from within without a need for booze, a pill, or bad company.</p>

World's First Ceramic Method (Patented)HomeCera is the World's First Invention by using Ceramic. Get rid of all Germs and Odor in your shoes with HomeCera, the Ceramic silicon carbide (SiC) shoe dryer to?care your athlete's foot.HomeCera consists of a Lithium-ion battery, Fan, and SiC (Silicon Carbide) Honeycomb Heater. Most similar products work through hot air, such as UV light or hair dryer, but HomeCera works by breaking down airborne bacteria, bad smells, and moisture. HomeCera operates through a Patented method of drying by circulating air with ceramic hydrocarbon (SiC) honeycomb heater. That is, HomeCera operates by inhaling air, not by drying it with hot heat, and by decomposing and discharging airborne germs, bad smells and moisture.  The odor passes through silicon carbide honeycomb, sterilizing and purifying, and emits far infrared rays into the air.           Sterilization, drying and air purification inside the shoe are available at once. Smoke in the box (Left) / Smoke disappeared in the box in 1 min (Right)   
2. Rapid Drying Power?HomeCera has Rapid drying power: 
HomeCera dries most of wet shoes within 1-2 hr. To prevent the spread of germs in the shoes, the first thing you should do is to dry your shoes perfectly.

 3.Sterilization Power Homecera suppresses the growth of mold hyphae with a ceramics far infrared ray and can completely decompose and remove airborne mold spores by passing through the SiC honeycomb using air convection. HomeCera eliminates athlete's foot, which is bacteria and fungi such as E. coli, and removes shoe odor. For your information, Athlete's foot has a structure that is not easy to exterminate by common methods and is obliterated only through hot air and inhalation decomposition.

 ""Homecera shoes dryer available for all shoes in the world”If you ask ""Leather shoes?"", we can confidently say,"" You can see the effects of the far-infrared radiation on the leather."" It can be used for any shoes regardless of shape, material, or function.    
The temperature of the honeycomb heater in SiC is real-time temperature sensor maintained at around 60 degrees
If the lithium-ion battery exceeds a certain voltage, it's designed to stop charging so it is safe from overheating or explosions
For safety of use, it is designed to stop using a charger other than a dedicated charger (It's required to use a dedicated chargers that comes with HomeCera).
    　　　  You can select one of 2 colors : Silver and White. HomeCera provides all with Free 2 x battery chargers for each pair. If you select 2 pair of HomeCera, You'll get 4 x battery chargers.        I am CEO at HomeCera and a product developer, Yang Jung Hee. I always had a lot of sweat on my hands and feet, so my socks were always wet. I was looking for a good shoe dryer, but there were only products on the market that used dangerous UV lamps or metallic hot-wires.  After experiencing many products, I decided to produce a good product by myself. At that time, I have been always curious about ceramics, and while collecting data such as how the smoke reduction system burned at high temperature, SiC (Silicon Carbide), a type of ceramic, was used as a heater for purifying air and releasing far-infrared rays, and was very useful for various sterilization, Drying as well as deodorization, so I made a prototype and registered a patent for Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan and the United States, and Vietnam.HomeCera is not simply heat-drying, like hair dryers, but are a new way of absorbing air to break down germs, odors and moisture in the air.  The product was designed using airflow to make shoes sterilized, dried, and deodorized. The portable cordless design is supposed to generate high temperature heat and is designed for both cored and cordless use so people can use it anytime when it is charged and not charged as well. HomeCera uses ceramics to make a variety of sterilizing & drying machines to make products that can protect our home without harmful substances.We're running again today.           Korean Broadcasting SBS TV   Japan Broadcasting  NHK",42.0,7,"1 Campaign

</div><p></p><h3>Short Summary</h3><div>Hi. I'm Diana. 
<p>I'm passionate about getting families moving together. I believe it's critical to  teach the fundamentals of efficient and effective movement so that people can move their bodies in safe, effective ways for their whole life. And I am passionate about having a place where people feel welcome, cared for, and inspired on their wellness journey.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Trava is all of those things. Trava is part neighborhood fitness studio, part wellness collective. And all about the health and wellness of our community. </b><br/></p>
<p>I have have been a health coach and nutritionist since 2007.  Over the course of my career I have seen huge gaps in local movement classes and education. And I've worked out of other studios, had a small space of my own, and now <b>I'm opening a large location to reach more of the community. And that's where I need your help.</b></p>
<p>As you'll see in the video, one main focus is to get families moving together. Instead of always separating parents and kids when it comes to ""getting a workout in"", we at Trava will offer special classes for people of all ages to move in the same space. </p>

<h3>A video tutorial program for adults and ​children</h3>
<p><strong>UpRightNOW</strong> is based on the in-person courses Kathleen Porter has been teaching to adults and children over the past twenty years. The video tutorials will provide the same step-by-step coaching for how to apply natural alignment principles to <strong>any task of daily living</strong>—how to <strong>sit </strong>comfortably in almost any situation, how to <strong>stand </strong>in line to vote, <strong>bend</strong> to tie a shoe, <strong>walk</strong> down the street (or along a rugged trail), <strong>lift</strong> a heavy box, <strong>carry</strong> a sleeping child up the stairs,<strong> reach</strong> for a book on a high shelf, <strong>run</strong> a race, and more—all activities done by way of <strong>mechanical movements</strong> that are <strong>natural</strong> <strong>to the human design</strong> and in almost all cases assures that the body is inhabited in a way that is pain-free. </p>
<p>Sharing this information with children can only come from adults who already understand this and are putting these principles into practice in their own lives. This is why the foundational program is geared primarily to adults, with many of the basic instructions easily adapted for children. An outline of steps for sharing this with children will be included for anyone signing up for UPRightNOW during this campaign, after which it will be available as an add-on component.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496268676/celxjqh7gow384dr384s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why this approach is unique and so effective</h3>
<p>The current approach to exercise and fitness emphasizes <strong>muscles—</strong>we either work to strengthen them or we stretch them—all the while ignoring the <strong>inseparable</strong> <strong>role of a naturally aligned skeleton in providing the underlying framework of support for the body to which our muscles are attached</strong>. Our skeleton is governed by the same basic rules of physics that require that wall studs and posts on a house align along the vertical axis of gravity or ""plumb line"" so that weight from above and forces of gravity can be distributed through them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496097865/gogs8htxggqndpwqv1dr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Humans </strong>are not houses, of course; we<strong> are alive and dynamic</strong>.  We move by way of a mechanical system of pulleys (muscles) that move levers (our bones). <strong>When we obey unnegotiable physical laws that define how our bones must relate with each other, our muscles </strong>(which attach to these bones via tendons)<strong> are </strong><i><strong>elastic</strong> </i>(neither too ""tight/stiff"" nor too weak). <strong>Instead of muscles having to overwork to ""hold"" us together, they now function as one part of a </strong><strong><i>balanced</i> <i>musculoskeletal system</i>.<i> </i></strong></p>
<p><strong>The images below</strong> demonstrate the ease and flow of movement when bones are naturally aligned vs. the muscular ""effort"" and spinal distortion that results when the structural foundation of the skeleton is compromised.</p>

<h3>Structural Alignment and Children's Wellbeing</h3>
<p>Due to an over-reliance on carriers, strollers, car seats and too-many hours spent in front of electronic screens, many children are losing their natural alignment at younger and younger ages. If nothing is done about this, the impacts on their overall health—sometimes for a lifetime—can be far-reaching. </p>
<p>Sports injuries among children have increased considerably over the past twenty-five years. Currently, more than 3.5 million children under the age of fourteen receive medical treatment for sports injuries each year.</p>

</div><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">and, finally—</h3><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Thank you so very much! </h2><p> </p></div>","A video tutorial program for adults and ​children
UpRightNOW is based on the in-person courses Kathleen Porter has been teaching to adults and children over the past twenty years. The video tutorials will provide the same step-by-step coaching for how to apply natural alignment principles to any task of daily living—how to sit comfortably in almost any situation, how to stand in line to vote, bend to tie a shoe, walk down the street (or along a rugged trail), lift a heavy box, carry a sleeping child up the stairs, reach for a book on a high shelf, run a race, and more—all activities done by way of mechanical movements that are natural to the human design and in almost all cases assures that the body is inhabited in a way that is pain-free. 
Sharing this information with children can only come from adults who already understand this and are putting these principles into practice in their own lives. This is why the foundational program is geared primarily to adults, with many of the basic instructions easily adapted for children. An outline of steps for sharing this with children will be included for anyone signing up for UPRightNOW during this campaign, after which it will be available as an add-on component.
 

 
Why this approach is unique and so effective
The current approach to exercise and fitness emphasizes muscles—we either work to strengthen them or we stretch them—all the while ignoring the inseparable role of a naturally aligned skeleton in providing the underlying framework of support for the body to which our muscles are attached. Our skeleton is governed by the same basic rules of physics that require that wall studs and posts on a house align along the vertical axis of gravity or ""plumb line"" so that weight from above and forces of gravity can be distributed through them.

Humans are not houses, of course; we are alive and dynamic.  We move by way of a mechanical system of pulleys (muscles) that move levers (our bones). When we obey unnegotiable physical laws that define how our bones must relate with each other, our muscles (which attach to these bones via tendons) are elastic (neither too ""tight/stiff"" nor too weak). Instead of muscles having to overwork to ""hold"" us together, they now function as one part of a balanced musculoskeletal system. 
The images below demonstrate the ease and flow of movement when bones are naturally aligned vs. the muscular ""effort"" and spinal distortion that results when the structural foundation of the skeleton is compromised.

Structural Alignment and Children's Wellbeing
Due to an over-reliance on carriers, strollers, car seats and too-many hours spent in front of electronic screens, many children are losing their natural alignment at younger and younger ages. If nothing is done about this, the impacts on their overall health—sometimes for a lifetime—can be far-reaching. 
Sports injuries among children have increased considerably over the past twenty-five years. Currently, more than 3.5 million children under the age of fourteen receive medical treatment for sports injuries each year.
 
Which of these children are more likely
to be injured while playing sports?
 
Is it these children, who have elongated spines, unrestricted joints, the support of aligned bones, and who move with ease and vigor?
 

 
Or is these children, who have compressed spines, restricted joint function, and who lack the support of solidly aligned legs? 
  

Sadly, a visit to a local playground or a Saturday morning children's soccer gathering is likely to reveal far too many children who routinely struggle with misaligned bodies. 
 

 
In return for your support . . .

<p><strong>More about the gut:</strong> The gut is the largest organ in the body, hosting all sorts of nutritional and immune processes over an area of 30m2. It is also the frontline of your immune system and thousands of signals and processes are continually approaching, connecting, being deflected and crossing into your blood stream and metabolism all the time. But it isn’t just an organ – it is an ecosystem, and you need to support it with the right nutrition. Seaweed hosts a plethora of molecules, including dietary fibres, that the World Health Organisation has identified are typically deficient in the Western Diet in terms of amount we ingest everyday as well as the diversity of types.</p>
<p><strong>Your opportunity in this campaign:</strong> So many people from all over the world wanted to be a part of our clinical studies exploring gut health and skin disorders such as psoriasis. That was logistically impossible to do - but now you can learn more about your gut yourself, make some changes in your life including a daily intake of seaweed dietary fibres, and then test your gut again. In our partnership with <a href=""http://ubiome.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">uBiome</a> - this is an exciting opportunity for your to take charge and learn more about this most important organ and ecosystem in your body, driving your wellness.</p>
<p><strong>What are the Seaweed capsules and how do they differ from other seaweed supplements?</strong></p>
<p>PhycoHealth has been doing research for the last decade on which seaweeds are of interest to gut health, and that can be eaten in adequate amounts without overdosing iodine. Our unique seaweed and extraction process means that you get capsules with concentrated seaweed dietary fibre, plus we have blended in marine Omega-3 as well so that you get both of the western dietary deficiencies covered at once. Both are important for reducing inflammation and both are commonly deficient in the western diet.</p>
<p><strong>How does the gut test kit work?</strong></p>
<p>Our partners at <a href=""http://www.ubiome.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">uBiome</a> have made it easy for you to now test your own gut health and learn how it works with you and your health. In some perks in this campaign, and because we are making links between gut health and skin, you will have access to a multi-site swab test kit where you simply swab a skin site and/or toilet paper and send the sample to uBiome. In 6-weeks you will get results online that give you an overall fingerprint of your gut fingerprint and an index of wellness compared to known healthy guts.</p>
<p>These are not diagnostic tests but they provide insights into how your own gut is working, and how your gut changes when you change things, like eating seaweed capsules or using skin products. So in this campaign perk you get a second kit to test yourself again after you have eaten capsules or used skin product for a couple of months.</p>

By purchasing PhycoHealth products as part of this campaign, you will become part of a collective movement to challenge the current food paradigm and take a stand for better health. 



Risks & Challenges
We will reward your faith in us. Our products have already won awards and are backed by solid science. We know this campaign is risky, but we have achieved so much with so little so far, that we know we can meet the challenge of scaling up.
We will start to roll out the crowd funding orders from July through to December this year, and we will show you your scheduled delivery time every step of the way. We will fulfill orders on a first in, first serve basis.
We will introduce you to the new staff we bring on and tell you about the new scaled production processes we are able to achieve with your support.
Be assured that campaign customers are our priority and we will only turn our online shop back on when all your campaign backer orders are delivered.

That's all there is to it!Testimonials“I have been taking the seaweed extract capsules for over 6 weeks now, and am extremely pleased to report back stunning results. Most importantly, for me, I have been able to wear a skirt and shorts for the first time in over 10 years! My legs and arms are so clear, that I no longer receive side glances at my nasty inflamed sores. As a woman, being able to wear fashion with confidence is paramount and extremely satisfying!  I thank you for the opportunity to test the seaweed product, and wish you all the very best for its future.” – Karla",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

After years of studying, traveling and working around the world, the founder and CEO of Tern, Mo Zerban, noticed a universal problem: Not everyone has easy access to safe and sustainable water.Thus, Tern was born, with one mission; empower people to obtain the best water possible, by providing them with the information and tools needed to ensure they have sustainable and safe water, wherever and whenever they would like. Our Vision was to develop an impactful product that would innovate the water experience, with an integrated technology component. The Tern Smart Faucet is the first product that delivers on our mission to ensure safe, sustainable water for all. Creating products and services with the user at the center of the experience is our top criteria for product development.  Based on continuous user research and demos, we have created the Smart Faucet through a series of prototypes.Here at Tern our glass is always half full. Our team is full of different personalities, ideas and skills, with one unifying goal: create safe and sustainable water for all.  What are people saying about water? What are people saying about us?The simplicity of our design proves to be an easy way to retrieve in-depth water analysis, that makes the invisibility of water contamination visible, as well as function as a safe and sustainable water filtration system. Our mission has not gone unnoticed, recently garnering praise:",61.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Stefan Antonov and I am a business journalist non professional rugby player from Bulgaria.</p>
<ul>
<li>With this campaign I am trying to complete the process of patenting my invention. It is a training machine that helps rugby and American football players to practice tackles in safe and realistic environment. </li>
<li>So far all tackling drills put the players before a dilemma whether to seek realism or safety. My machine will elevate the combination of safety and realism in practicing tackles to unseen before levels. </li>
<li>It will allow players to strive for their highest speed and strength in performing the tackle but they will exercise on a moving dummy instead on a real person.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I need the funding to protect my intellectual property rights on the markets I am targeting - EU, USA, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina and Canada. </li>
<li>During this campaign I will offer perks related to my invention and sophisticated items which are made of quality materials.</li>
<li>If the targeted funding is not completely achieved I will have to prioritize the countries/markets on which I will seek a patent.  </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Missed tackles are a global phenomenon that occurs more and more often in modern rugby. Statisticians have proven that teams who miss less tackles have higher chances to win their games. And this exactly is what my machine will help the players and their teams. </li>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The main goal of the North American Fitness and Health team is to prevent obesity and keep participants active. </p>
<p>Have you ever tried to meet fitness goals and it was just not fun? We can help keep workouts fun with the Fit Zoo Crew Game. Fit Zoo Crew characters show participants how to perform each exercise. The team is designing functional workouts that are sports specific. Our workouts can teach participants skills, improve performance and keep them active. We're trying to get games into as many educational programs, youth sports leagues and as many families as possible.</p>
<p>NAFH is a nonprofit organization. Many participants lack access to knowledge of healthy lifestyles. We can help them learn to live healthier lifestyles with the Fit Zoo Crew.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We need $100,000 to get as many decks of playing cards as possible to programs and families. </p>
<p>Many families who could benefit lack funding to obtain well balanced workouts. We're a nonprofit. You donation can reach a large number of participants and help them avoid weight related health issues.</p>
<p>The Fit Zoo Crew playing cards will be 100% plastic and sports specific decks will be included. The 9 new decks of playing cards will be: <strong>football, baseball, basketball, soccer, cheer, volleyball, functional exercises for seniors, military fitness, and water exercises. We'll also create the original Fit Zoo Crew workout deck emphasizing body weight exercises.</strong></p>
<p>For every $50 you contribute, we'll send you a deck of cards. For example, contribute $150 and select 3 decks of cards. Contribute $400 and select a complete set of 10 decks or mix and match 10 decks as you like.  </p>
<p>You'll also have the first chance to test NAFH mobile apps if you make a donation of at least $20.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You'll feel great about impacting the lives of people who may not lead healthy lifestyles. Many of the children who have participated in the Fit Zoo Crew game are able to get parents and siblings involved in fun workouts. You'll help to prevent Type 2 diabetes, and its associated diseases, in participants.</p>
<p>The North American and Fitness team includes, personal trainers, strength coaches and educators. We're trying to reach as many people, including those lower income participants, who may benefit by using our game. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>If we do not reach our goal of $100.000, we will produce as many decks of cards as possible with the contributions. Since fewer decks of cards would be ordered, the price will increase for each deck. NAFH would have to decrease the number of decks produced or decrease the types of decks produced. If we do not reach our goal, fewer people would receive the benefits provided by exercise including: improved performance, help with weight management, improved self esteem and overall mental health, decrease in blood pressure, improved cardiovascular health, learning to cooperate with others in a fun environment and learning to live a healthier lifestyle.</p>

The device has a rigid front wheel (also removable using a quick release fastener) and two rear wheels which are independently driven by two electric motors (24V, 120 W). Due to its rigid axle, RUFUS will move straight until an obstacle blocks its path or forces off course. RUFUS is steered by operating the two drive motors at different speeds.

The mode suggested for an effective training is ""program control"". The speed or heart rate set points come from a program that controls your entire running workout, such as interval training or a pyramid run. You merely have to make sure that RUFUS remains on track and does not collide with an obstacle, RUFUS does the rest.

Erwin Prassler, roboticist and hobby triathlete, regularly took his daughters out for a run in their baby jogger. They had their fun, as he struggled up the hills and hardly kept pace with the stroller when running back down. He was one of many who pushed themselves too hard and ran too fast. Although he knew better, and was repeatedly warned by his triathlon coach, he continued running as fast as he could, pushing himself harder and harder, with disregard for self imposed limits.<br/>“When jogging you have plenty of time to contemplate, in particular if you stare at the rear axle of a stroller” he says. “I was tired of the incessant beeping of my heart rate monitor telling me that my heart rate was way too high.” It could not be that difficult to equip a stroller with a few electric motors and propel it just as fast as to prevent his heart rate from going through the roof. He continued running too fast without benefiting from his exercises for a few more years – later without the kids and the stroller, but with all kinds of fitness trackers instead – until eventually he had enough.<br/>He fetched the dusty stroller from the basement and took action with some colleagues. They converted the stroller into what would become the world's first prototype of a robot running coach. Six generations of prototypes later and RUFUS finally reached series-production readiness. And as fate would have it, one of the very daughters that inspired RUFUS has become an avid runner herself.  She frequently trains with RUFUS ensuring her a healthier and more effective workout.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556547735/qixl1dmaa6aupd4ggzr8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556547768/jfaw9j62ivbtpsgu4m8j.jpg"" src=""""/>We plan to deliver the first devices in time for the marathon season in fall 2019.

Erwin Prassler, Roboterentwickler und Hobbytriathlet, nahm seine damals noch kleinen Töchter im Babyjogger regelmäßig mit zum Joggen. Die hatten ihren Spaß, wenn er sich ächzend die Hügel hochkämpfte und fanden es lustig, wenn er bergab dem Kinderwagen kaum hinterher kam. Er gehörte zu den vielen, die sich beim Laufen sehr schnell überanstrengen. Obwohl er es besser wusste und es von seinem Lauftrainer im Triathlon-Verein oft genug gesagt bekam, lief er einfach weiter was die Laufschuhe hergaben – viel zu schnell.<br/>„Beim Joggen hat man ja viel Zeit zum nachdenken, vor allem wenn man auf die Hinterachse eines Kinderwagens starrt“ sagt er heute. „Irgendwann war ich das dauernde Piepen meiner Pulsuhr leid, die mir nur mitteilte, dass ich wieder mal zu schnell und mit zu hohem Puls unterwegs war“. Es konnte doch nicht so schwer sein, diesen Kinderwagen mit ein paar Elektromotoren genau so schnell zu bewegen, dass sein Puls nicht permanent durch die Decke ging.

It drives in front of you at your optimal pace. This pace is adjusted dynamically in response to your heart rate. For example, if your heart rate increases because you are running up a steep slope, RUFUS will reduce its speed until your heart rate settles back into your target range.  Conversely, when your heart rate drops below your target rate, RUFUS will increase its speed accordingly. The best training effect can be achieved with a custom-made training plan, in which strain and relief alternate in a balanced way and training stimuli are set without overstraining the body permanently.   Heart rate monitors, running computers and training apps have a serious disadvantage in training control and support of the natural running rhythm. These devices only give indirect feedback. They may warn you with different signals when you are running too fast or your heart rate is too high, but they are unable to help you set a healthy pace. Warnings alone are insufficient in preventing errors while training. This was found in a study by the Sports University of Cologne, where only 32% of all runners reported an improvement in their performance. RUFUS sets its pace in response to your target heart rate and makes training not only more efficient and safer, but also more enjoyable!      Read the German article ""Fitness-Tracker waren gestern. Heute ist RUFUS!""https://www.running-magazin.com/training/lauftraining-mit-rufus/ RUFUS works similar to a treadmill with a heart rate monitor, but it allows you the freedom of running outside. It works by driving ahead of you, setting your pace, and showing you your optimal speed.While you are running it continuously measures your heart rate and transmits the measured value to its on-board computer. There the measurement is analyzed and translated into an immediate feedback by adjusting your pace accordingly.The ideal value (target value) is determined by a physiotherapist or a professional trainer and is encoded in your training plan. If your own heart rate deviates from the target value, RUFUS increases or decreases its speed. This achieves an optimal training effect and avoids overstraining.      Watch the German video ""Diese Fitness-Trends für 2018 sollten Sie nicht verpassen​""https://www.welt.de/sport/video173070225/ISPO-2018-Diese-Fitness-Trends-fuer-2018-sollten-Sie-nicht-verpassen.html​ RUFUS can be easily controlled with a mobile app. There you will find two control options: In the manual control mode you can manually enter set points for speed or heart rate. In the program control mode you can execute a complete workout which is part of a pre-programmed training plan. A control panel will pop up when you touch the screen and allows you to start or stop RUFUS and increase or decrease the set points. During your running workout the app plots your measured heart rate and speed. RUFUS does not need to be constantly controlled. Thanks to its rigid axle, it drives straight in front of you. Hands and arms remain free for the natural movement in the running rhythm. You only have to intervene when you wish to change direction or stop.How to steerRUFUS' heading can be set by a remote control. With this controller you are able to adjust RUFUS' speed and direction.How to stopThere are three ways to stop RUFUS:
Firmly grasp the handlebars: The contact sensors in the hand grip will deactivate the motors and RUFUS comes to a complete stop. You can then push or pull the device like a shopping cart.
Pull the safety tether: The safety tether is connected to an emergency stop mechanism. When triggered this brings RUFUS to an immediate stop.
Press the stop button on the remote control: This will also trigger RUFUS to a full and complete stop.
   RUFUS is a self-controlled electric vehicle for professional outdoor running workouts. It consists of a vehicle frame and a steering column, which can be adjusted easily and folded after using the quick release fastener.  When folded RUFUS fits into the trunk of almost any car. The device has a rigid front wheel (also removable using a quick release fastener) and two rear wheels which are independently driven by two electric motors (24V, 120 W). Due to its rigid axle, RUFUS will move straight until an obstacle blocks its path or forces off course. RUFUS is steered by operating the two drive motors at different speeds. If the right wheel turns faster than the left one, RUFUS turns to the left, if the left wheel turns faster, RUFUS turns to the right.

  Read the German article ""Bruckner testet Rufus – Lauf Roboter, lauf!​""https://wiener-online.at/2018/05/17/bruckner-testet-rufus-lauf-roboter-lauf/​ RUFUS has two operating modes: manual and program control. The mode suggested for an effective training is ""program control"". The speed or heart rate set points come from a program that controls your entire running workout, such as interval training or a pyramid run. You merely have to make sure that RUFUS remains on track and does not collide with an obstacle, RUFUS does the rest. A running workout is usually part of a training plan, which consists of a whole series of workouts.      The device will be available in two versions at market launch: RUFUS Basic and RUFUS Pro. The Basic version contains all functions needed for professional running workouts. The Pro version targets professional running coaches and physiotherapists who will use RUFUS as a coach assistant. The conception of a robotic running coach began over 10 years ago. Erwin Prassler, roboticist and hobby triathlete, regularly took his daughters out for a run in their baby jogger. They had their fun, as he struggled up the hills and hardly kept pace with the stroller when running back down. He was one of many who pushed themselves too hard and ran too fast. Although he knew better, and was repeatedly warned by his triathlon coach, he continued running as fast as he could, pushing himself harder and harder, with disregard for self imposed limits.“When jogging you have plenty of time to contemplate, in particular if you stare at the rear axle of a stroller” he says. “I was tired of the incessant beeping of my heart rate monitor telling me that my heart rate was way too high.” It could not be that difficult to equip a stroller with a few electric motors and propel it just as fast as to prevent his heart rate from going through the roof. He continued running too fast without benefiting from his exercises for a few more years – later without the kids and the stroller, but with all kinds of fitness trackers instead – until eventually he had enough.He fetched the dusty stroller from the basement and took action with some colleagues. They converted the stroller into what would become the world's first prototype of a robot running coach. Six generations of prototypes later and RUFUS finally reached series-production readiness. And as fate would have it, one of the very daughters that inspired RUFUS has become an avid runner herself.  She frequently trains with RUFUS ensuring her a healthier and more effective workout. We plan to deliver the first devices in time for the marathon season in fall 2019. All orders will be delivered, regardless of the achieved target percentage. The revenues from the campaign will be used for financing the following activities:
Purchase of material for the first two batches
Developing tools for manufacturing
Production of the first two batches
Certification related activities e.g. EMC test
Marketing campaign
     Interview with co-founder and inventor Dr. Erwin Prassler Looking for more information or have a question? See the FAQ (scroll to top or bottom) or contact us directly via support@runfun.com         Bei einem Lauftraining mit RUFUS kann das nicht passieren. RUFUS fährt mit einer Geschwindigkeit vor Dir her, die Deiner optimalen Trainingsbelastung entspricht. Steigt Dein Puls an einem Berg über den eingestellten Sollwert, dann verringert RUFUS seine Geschwindigkeit bis sich Dein Puls wieder im Sollbereich eingependelt hat. Sinkt umgekehrt die Belastung und der Puls bei einem Lauf bergab, dann erhöht RUFUS seine Geschwindigkeit dementsprechend. Den besten Trainingseffekt erreicht man mit einem maßgeschneiderten Trainingsplan, in dem sich Belastung und Entlastung ausgewogen abwechseln und gezielt Trainingsreize gesetzt werden, ohne den Körper dauerhaft zu überlasten.    Pulsuhren, Laufcomputer und Trainings- Apps haben einen gravierenden Nachteil bei der Trainingssteuerung und Unterstützung des natürlichen Laufrhythmus: Sie geben nur ein indirektes Feedback. Sie warnen Dich zwar durch verschiedene Signale bei zu hoher Geschwindigkeit oder zu hohem Puls aber sie zeigen Dir nicht die richtige Geschwindigkeit. Die reine Alarmfunktion reicht zur Vermeidung von fortlaufenden Trainingsfehlern nicht aus. Das zeigt eine Studie der Sporthochschule Köln, in der nur 32% aller Läufer eine Verbesserung ihrer Leistung feststellten.RUFUS gibt Dir ein Lauftempo vor, welches Deinem optimalen Puls entspricht und macht das Training so nicht nur effektiver und gesünder, er erhöht auch den Spaß am Laufen.      Hier findest du den Artikel ""Fitness-Tracker waren gestern. Heute ist RUFUS!""​https://www.running-magazin.com/training/lauftraining-mit-rufus/ RUFUS funktioniert ähnlich wie ein Laufband mit Pulssteuerung für Draußen. Nur steht er nicht fest an einem Platz, sondern fährt als Tempomacher vor Dir her und gibt Dir dadurch die optimale Geschwindigkeit direkt vor.Maßgeblich für die optimale Laufgeschwindigkeit ist Deine Herzfrequenz. Sie wird während des Laufens fortwährend über einen Pulsmesser ermittelt und per Funk an den Bordcomputer von RUFUS übertragen. Dort wird der Istwert mit dem Sollwert verglichen und die Geschwindigkeit je nach Differenz angepasst.Der ideale Wert (Sollwert) wird von einem Physiotherapeuten oder einem professionellen Trainer bestimmt und im Trainingsplan festgelegt. Weicht der eigene Puls vom Sollpuls ab, erhöht oder verringert RUFUS seine Geschwindigkeit. Dadurch wird ein optimaler Trainingseffekt erzielt und eine Überanstrengung vermieden.      Hier findest Du das Video ""Diese Fitness-Trends für 2018 sollten Sie nicht verpassen​""https://www.welt.de/sport/video173070225/ISPO-2018-Diese-Fitness-Trends-fuer-2018-sollten-Sie-nicht-verpassen.html Bedient wird RUFUS einfach über eine App. Es gibt zwei Optionen:Die manuelle Steuerung mit Sollwerten, die per Hand eingegeben werden, oder die Programmsteuerung mit vorprogrammierten Trainingsplänen und Trainingseinheiten. Über das Control Panel, das erscheint, wenn Du den Bildschirm berührst, kannst Du RUFUS starten, anhalten oder Deine Sollwerte erhöhen oder verringern. Während des Laufens kannst Du Dir den Verlauf Deiner Herzfrequenz und Geschwindigkeit oder Deine bereits gelaufene Route anzeigen lassen. RUFUS muss nicht dauerhaft gelenkt werden. Er fährt dank seiner starren Achse geradeaus vor Dir her. Hände und Arme bleiben frei für die natürliche Bewegung im Laufrhythmus. Nur für Richtungsänderungen und Stopps muss Du eingreifen.So wird gelenktDie Fahrtrichtung von RUFUS wird mithilfe einer Fernbedienung kontrolliert. Du kannst nach links oder rechts lenken und die Geschwindigkeit erhöhen oder reduzieren.So hält RUFUS anEs gibt drei Möglichkeiten:
Die Handgriffe sind mit Kontaktsensoren ausgestattet. Ein fester Griff genügt, um das Gerät anzuhalten.
Durch Ziehen der Sicherheitsleine bleibt Dein Lauftrainer sofort auf der Stelle stehen.
Ein Druck auf den Stopp-Knopf der Fernbedienung bringt RUFUS ebenfalls schnellstmöglich zum Stehen.
    RUFUS ist ein elektrisch angetriebenes und gesteuertes Fahrzeug für ein professionelles Lauftraining im Freien. Er besteht aus einem Fahrzeugrahmen und einer Lenksäule, die man über einen Schnellspannverschluss fixieren und einklappen kann. Zusammengeklappt passt RUFUS in fast jeden Kofferraum. Das Gerät hat ein starres Vorderrad, das ebenfalls mit einem Schnellspannverschluss befestigt ist, und zwei Hinterräder, die unabhängig voneinander von zwei Elektromotoren (24V, 120 W) angetrieben werden. Aufgrund seiner starren Achse fährt RUFUS normalerweise solange gerade aus, bis ein Hindernis seinen Weg versperrt oder ihn vom Weg abbringt. Gelenkt wird der Lauftrainer indem man die beiden Antriebsmotoren mit einer unterschiedlichen Drehgeschwindigkeit betreibt. Dreht sich während der Fahrt das rechte Rad schneller als das linke, dann fährt RUFUS eine Kurve nach links, dreht das linke Rad schneller, dann fährt er nach rechts. 

Fahrgestell: Dreirad mit 2 differentiell angetriebenen Hinterrädern

Maximale Geschwindigkeit (bei 12“ Rädern): 18 km/h

Gewicht: 18 kg

Antrieb: 2 x 24 V Gleichstrommotoren mit je 120 W

Batterie: 24 V Lithium-Ionen Akku (10.4 Ah, 13 Ah, 16 Ah oder 17.5 Ah) + Ladegerät

Laufzeit in ebenem Gelände: 6 - 8 Stunden

Benutzerinterface: Steuerung per eingebautem Touchpanel (Tablet)

Biosensoren: Pulsmesser (Bluetooth; ANT+)

Sicherheit: Sicherungsleine zwischen Läufer und Gerät (führt zu Notstopp falls unterbrochen)

Navigationssensoren: GPS, Rad-Encoder, Inertialsensor

Handhabung:​- klappbare Lenksäule- Räder sind leicht zu wechseln- ​Batterie kann herausgelöst und separat aufgeladen werden
  Hier findest Du den Artikel ""Bruckner testet Rufus – Lauf Roboter, lauf!​""https://wiener-online.at/2018/05/17/bruckner-testet-rufus-lauf-roboter-lauf/ RUFUS hat zwei Betriebsarten: manuell und programmgesteuert. Die für das Training effektivere Betriebsart ist die „Programmsteuerung“. Dabei kommen die Geschwindigkeits- oder Pulsvorgaben von einem Programm, das eine ganze Trainingseinheit steuert, beispielsweise ein Intervalltraining oder einen Pyramidenlauf. Als Läufer musst Du lediglich darauf achten, dass ihr beide auf dem Laufweg bleibt und nicht mit einem Hindernis kollidiert. Den Rest erledigt RUFUS. Eine Trainingseinheit gehört in der Regel zu einem Trainingsplan, der aus einem ganzen Paket von Trainingseinheiten besteht.    RUFUS wird in zwei Versionen auf den Markt kommen: RUFUS Basic und RUFUS Pro. Die Basic-Variante ist eine vollwertige Grundversion für jeden Typ von Läufer. Die Pro-Variante richtet sich an professionelle Lauftrainer und Physiotherapeuten.  Die Idee eines Roboterlauftrainers entstand schon vor über 10 Jahren beim Joggen. Erwin Prassler, Roboterentwickler und Hobbytriathlet, nahm seine damals noch kleinen Töchter im Babyjogger regelmäßig mit zum Joggen. Die hatten ihren Spaß, wenn er sich ächzend die Hügel hochkämpfte und fanden es lustig, wenn er bergab dem Kinderwagen kaum hinterher kam. Er gehörte zu den vielen, die sich beim Laufen sehr schnell überanstrengen. Obwohl er es besser wusste und es von seinem Lauftrainer im Triathlon-Verein oft genug gesagt bekam, lief er einfach weiter was die Laufschuhe hergaben – viel zu schnell.„Beim Joggen hat man ja viel Zeit zum nachdenken, vor allem wenn man auf die Hinterachse eines Kinderwagens starrt“ sagt er heute. „Irgendwann war ich das dauernde Piepen meiner Pulsuhr leid, die mir nur mitteilte, dass ich wieder mal zu schnell und mit zu hohem Puls unterwegs war“. Es konnte doch nicht so schwer sein, diesen Kinderwagen mit ein paar Elektromotoren genau so schnell zu bewegen, dass sein Puls nicht permanent durch die Decke ging. Er lief noch ein paar Jahre länger viel zu schnell, als dass es ihm wirklich genützt hätte. Später auch ohne Töchter und Kinderwagen, dafür aber mit allen möglichen Fitnesstrackern – bis er endgültig genug hatte vom falschen Trainieren mit zu hoher Geschwindigkeit.Er holte den verstaubten Kinderwagen aus dem Keller und schritt mit ein paar Kollegen und Mitarbeitern zur Tat: aus dem umgebauten Kinderwagen entstand der weltweit erste Prototyp eines Roboter-Lauftrainer. Fünf weitere Generationen von Prototypen waren notwendig, bis RUFUS schließlich seine Serienreife erreichte. Die ältere Tochter ist mittlerweile selbst begeisterte Läuferin und trainiert natürlich mit RUFUS. Wir wollen die ersten Geräte rechtzeitig zur Marathon Saison im Herbst 2019 ausliefern. Alle Bestellungen werden ausgeliefert, unabhängig von den erreichten Ziel-Prozenten. Die Einnahmen aus der Kampagne sollen zur Finanzierung folgender Aktivitäten verwendet werden:
Materialeinkauf für die ersten beiden Lose
Entwicklung und Herstellung der Werkzeuge für die Fertigung
Fertigung der ersten beiden Lose

<h3>The Basics</h3>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Although there are already an avalanche of mask products in the market, or in development, I am working to manufacture the first actual mass-market TRANSPARENT face mask.  This is not only for Coronavirus.....there are a whole bunch of other industries that will want this product.

<p>I have a patent pending for this particular design. There are a multitude of variants of the mask that can be marketed in further development.</p>
<p>Competitor products are being announced daily at this point, but there are several elements of this design that are unique.  The most important is that the air vents are anti-microbial in BOTH directions, for inhaling AND exhaling.  It's a porous plastic sheet that's treated with a spray-on microbe killer that kills everything down to 2 microns (including Coronavirus).  But a flexible, soft plastic mask that's good for hundreds of uses, can be cleaned, filters replaceable, and CLEAR so you can see smiles and emotions, it's an important step forward in the world we are living in.</p>

<h3>Funding and gifts</h3>
<p>I am seeking $250,000 in funding to bring the first full manufacture product to the market.  The vast majority of the process is already in place.

We designed this ear and forehead thermometer based on the standard of the world’s loveliest medical instrument. That’s not only for taking body temperature when sick, but also for inspiring people on a healthy lifestyle that we often look at one of our vital signs – the core body temperature.


Really lovely
It doesn’t look like a typical medical instrument that always implies the infirmity, but one of that you loved in your fancy life.

Really fast and accurate
Get reading close to the core body temperature in less than one second, that raised the bar to a new balance between fast and accuracy.

 
Really medical
Top sensor with biocompatible and RoHS-cleared materials from inside and external parts. 
 
Really inspired
Get inspired by seeing how pills and your lifestyle impact on your body temperature.

Really creative
Your body temperature data is always allowed to be using by yourself to relieve you from the fuss and mess when you are not well.

 
Get extensive health benefits from body-temperature management

 
 
 
Overview your ThermArt

 How ThermArt comes true 

 
Comper Featured on 

Why it looks so lovely 
Tracking body temperature is becoming a health style that empowers people to have an insight into their health. A lovely design for a medical device could be truly inspirational than a traditional one which is looking always about the sick.

As tracking body temperature has become a healthy lifestyle, people can have an insight into their health. Comparing with the traditional medical device, the lovely design for ThermArt is more acceptable and inspirational.
 
Why it’s so qualified
The body of ThermArt is made of the medical-grade PC with IML(In-mould labeling) texture technique, which is biocompatible without any extra industrial process on the surface.

 
The forehead probe made of transparent silicon rubber meets the medical standard. It brings a real soft and biocompatible touch.   
 
 
 Why it brings so much pleasant measurement？ 
Get pleasant by its design to measure temperature as a  Friendly and lovely gesture.

Get pleasant by the perfect haptic feedback from the button. 
Get pleasant by checking your body temperature on a fancy LED display.  
 
Why it can be multi-choice?
A friendly forehead touch is for babies for a more comfortable and safe experience, or a more accurate ear probe is for other ages.

Tips: You may get different measurements on the forehead and in the ear, since the forehead is exposed under the external environment and affected by the environment temperature.
 Why it is safe for your baby? 

 
Why it has a fast read and high accuracy? 
ThermArt uses the top-of-the-line sensor from japan which is the fastest and most accurate technology so far in the world.

 
The hollow structure design for the forehead probe keeps the accuracy of the temperature measurement by avoiding the effect of the external environment.

The silicon rubber material can reduce the environmental error on the forehead due to its property of low thermal transmission.
 

The accuracy of measurements is based on the Comper algorithm by reaching close to the core body temperature that is a real vital sign of our health.

Needless to say we are extremely excited about bringing our child into this world. We found out that our baby was a girl and we decided to name her Rain. We began to prepare for her birth as all parents do; however this was stopped short when we found out that our little Rain has a congenital heart defect called truncus arteriosis. Truncus arteriosis is a very rare heart defect that is present at birth. It means that Rain has one large blood vessel that leads out of her heart. Normally, there are two separate vessels. In addition, the two lower chambers of the heart are missing a portion of the wall that divides them. As you can see Rain requires a lot of special care. Laura and I set out to find the best hospital to care for Rain and we found Nationwide Children’s Hospital located in Columbus, Ohio. This hospital is approximately 1500 miles from our home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. While Laura was still carrying Rain we traveled to the hospital to prepare for her birth. We are away from our family, our friends, and my job that supports us. Rain was born December 14, 2014 after 28 long hours of labor, she weighed 3 pounds. Tiny yet strong our little Rain is a fighter and she continues to fight every single day. At just 16 days old Rain suffered a cardiac arrest; thankfully she was able to fight her way back to us. We are facing many more surgeries and procedures to help save Rain. This is where you come in I have exhausted all of my resources and I am the sole provider for my family.

Thanks from family lobos</span><br/></p></div>","Hello my name is Daniel my wife Laura and I found out last year that we were expecting our first child. Needless to say we are extremely excited about bringing our child into this world. We found out that our baby was a girl and we decided to name her Rain. We began to prepare for her birth as all parents do; however this was stopped short when we found out that our little Rain has a congenital heart defect called truncus arteriosis. Truncus arteriosis is a very rare heart defect that is present at birth. It means that Rain has one large blood vessel that leads out of her heart. Normally, there are two separate vessels. In addition, the two lower chambers of the heart are missing a portion of the wall that divides them. As you can see Rain requires a lot of special care. Laura and I set out to find the best hospital to care for Rain and we found Nationwide Children’s Hospital located in Columbus, Ohio. This hospital is approximately 1500 miles from our home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. While Laura was still carrying Rain we traveled to the hospital to prepare for her birth. We are away from our family, our friends, and my job that supports us. Rain was born December 14, 2014 after 28 long hours of labor, she weighed 3 pounds. Tiny yet strong our little Rain is a fighter and she continues to fight every single day. At just 16 days old Rain suffered a cardiac arrest; thankfully she was able to fight her way back to us. We are facing many more surgeries and procedures to help save Rain. This is where you come in I have exhausted all of my resources and I am the sole provider for my family. I am not able to work at this time so that I can be with Laura and Rain. I need help, and I am reaching out to you to ask for it. No donation is too small and all donations are greatly appreciated. Please help us save our little Rain, she is our world. Thanks from family lobos",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Let's see if we can get this project up to $20,000! With the additional $5,000 we will send Dr. Nell Bond back to Koinadugu to reunite with the local public health sector, carefully vet potential collaborators, recruit, hire, and train survivors, and then let the project loose! These additional funds are critical for ensuring the look and feel of the project stays true to our original intent. Can you help?!</span></p>

I'm Sarah and I'm convinced we can end the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Over the past ten years, I have been studying emerging infectious diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa. This work allows me to make connections with doctors, researchers, community leaders, and social innovators from around the world. From these connections I assembled a Project Design Team, and we brainstormed a unique and powerful solution to West Africa's Ebola crisis.</span></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Research shows that survivors of Ebola are immune for up to ten years. This makes them ideal as first responders, because it lowers the risk of spreading the disease to caregivers. Then, we give them intensive training in Ebola response, and set them up with Responder Kits (gloves, gowns, buckets, and bleach). The final step as Ebola responders is to establish a direct link between survivors and access to advanced care and treatment. </span></p>

</div></div>","New Stretch Goal Announced
Indiegogo gave us a few more days to meet and beat our fundraising goal. Let's see if we can get this project up to $20,000! With the additional $5,000 we will send Dr. Nell Bond back to Koinadugu to reunite with the local public health sector, carefully vet potential collaborators, recruit, hire, and train survivors, and then let the project loose! These additional funds are critical for ensuring the look and feel of the project stays true to our original intent. Can you help?!
*     *     *

Thank you for visiting! I'm Sarah and I'm convinced we can end the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Over the past ten years, I have been studying emerging infectious diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa. This work allows me to make connections with doctors, researchers, community leaders, and social innovators from around the world. From these connections I assembled a Project Design Team, and we brainstormed a unique and powerful solution to West Africa's Ebola crisis.

Our idea was highlighted in the OpenIDEO Fighting Ebola Challenge sponsored by USAID.


Our goal is to stop the current Ebola epidemic and prevent future outbreaks.


While the rate of infections is thankfully slowing, Sierra Leone (a country half the size of Wisconsin) still has more than 500 new infections a month. Now is the time to buckle down and finish this.

How?
We start by
identifying survivors. 



Research shows that survivors of Ebola are immune for up to ten years. This makes them ideal as first responders, because it lowers the risk of spreading the disease to caregivers. Then, we give them intensive training in Ebola response, and set them up with Responder Kits (gloves, gowns, buckets, and bleach). The final step as Ebola responders is to establish a direct link between survivors and access to advanced care and treatment. 
Ebola survivors will also be trained in community public health service and mobilization, making both immediate and long-term service opportunities available.


Where?
Our work will begin in the Koinadugu District, Sierra Leone. 



Who?
An in-country partnership with the Ministry of Health in Koinadugu District is in the works!  This is a key partner for ensuring the sustainability of the project.  Visit the Koinadugu District City Council webpage to learn more about a dynamic and committed group of leaders in a very rural area.

When?
We are ready for rapid implementation.  With your contribution we will recruit and train the inaugural 3-5 members of the Ebola Survivors Corps as soon as April 1, 2015!
Time to get involved!
Our fundraising goal is $15,000. All of the work being done by the Project Design Team is pro bono; and all the funds raised will go straight into the project (no overhead, US-based salaries, institutional fees, etc). All contributions will be directed to our nonprofit fiscal partner. All donors will receive a tax-deduction receipt shortly after the campaign winds up (March 20, 2015).  




The first $5,000 will be used to cover the salary of 3-5 Ebola Survivors for one year.


The next $5,000 is dedicated to training and infection control supplies stock-up. 


The final $5,000 will be used to support the operations of the Ebola Survivor Corps throughout the year.  This includes expenses such as mobile phone minutes, internet connection, transportation, community health outreach, and Ebola prevention PSAs.

LET'S STRETCH OURSELVES AND RAISE ANOTHER $5000 TO SEND DR. NELL BOND BACK TO KOINADUGU TO LAUNCH THE PROJECT IN PERSON!

fighters who drive this entire industry. 10% of all profits earned through OSS Mentality will be donated to the OSS Mentality Fighters Fund. A fund exclusively set up to help support combat sports athletes in need.

OSS - to persevere when pushed, never give up, have
determination, grit and withstand the most arduous of training.

OSS can be used as an introductory to your opponent (to begin a fight) and/or
to conclude a match as a genuine display of respect. As a sign of respect to
your sensei or ‘professor’ for having taken the time to demonstrate a move or
to ‘sign-off’ from a hard training day.

We need your
help to raise $30,000 so
we can continue to work on making OSS Mentality, a positive force in the combat
sports world a reality! 
By contributing to our IndieGOGO campaign
you are helping to:

• Finish development, launch and maintain the ossmentality.com website and
online teaching/consulting platform. This also includes web hosting and
bandwidth.

• Develop the OSS Mentality online store where you can buy kickass products.

• Pay creative freelancers (branding, website design, marketing materials etc.)

• Marketing/outreach. This is huge! Without exposure through marketing OSS
Mentality may not reach the people who would love to purchase lessons online
from pro fighters or get pro nutrition advice that can take them to the next
level and help industry pros earn extra income. Without funding for outreach
OSS Mentality is limited in how and who we can recruit as instructors.

The fight business is an uncertain, difficult, and dangerous
place to make a living. Income can come in bursts and then disappear for
months. Training and equipment can be expensive and injuries are common. Fights
get cancelled, opponents drop out and your livelihood is dependent on you being
able to fight.

OSS Mentality has been created with the goal of helping pro and amateur
fighters. By supporting Oss Mentality you are helping to facilitate an
alternative source of income for combat sports athletes and industry related
experts.
We will be the first ever in this industry to host live one on one video conferencing with participating fighters, coaches, nutritionists, managers, doctors, agents, potential sponsors and so on. These people can set their own schedule, rates, and frequency. OSS Mentality facilitates the entire process from scheduling and providing the video platform to online payments! Securely and easily.

Also when you do anything through OSSMENTALITY.COM you will be giving back to the fighters who drive this entire industry. They are the reason this exists.Every time a coach, fighter, nutritionist etc. uses OSSMentality.com to teach a lesson, give advice, run through techniques etc. 80% goes to the person teaching, and 20% goes to facilitate OSS Mentality

<p>This is Crooksy over 25 years ago carving a bull for us and is Terri also over 25 years ago watching him working on our carving.</p>
<p>We decided last fall to return to Negril for our 25th anniversary and we wanted to find Crooksy after all these years. When we arrived, I put the name out on the beach to see if anyone knew him and found out he was very well know still and well liked by all. We told them our story and asked them to go find him and tell him we wanted to see him.</p>
<p>Crooksy came to see us on the beach the very next day. What an experience after all those years. It was truly amazing to find and old friend. What are the odds?</p>
<p>Croosky now 77 years old and his wife of over 40 years Cynthia is 60 years old. They still had their shop across the street at the little market called Rutland Point Crafters Market.</p>
<p>We spent quite a lot of time with them and to find out the market was struggling with competition now on the beach and a much worse issue, Cynthia was diagnosed with Cancer.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>They did not know the total prognosis because they did not have the money
for her to go to Montego Bay to see the doctor and get the results and
recommendations for treatment.</p>
<p>We gave them money right then and said go tomorrow which she did. When she
came back the next day they showed me the letter from the hospital outlining
her Cancer and recommended treatment. They did not understand and could not
read the medical jargon in that letter. Croosky told me in Jamaica many people
just die from Cancer because they cannot afford treatment. After reading the
letter and doing my best to decipher what she had and that she needed
radiation, Terri and I decided to forgo our Christmas presents to each other
and help pay for her travel and medical costs to make her well again.</p>
<p>Cynthia is not just just a great lady but she is also raising her 10 year
old granddaughter full time and another granddaughter part time. My point is,
this lady gives to everyone selflessly and is very needed in many ways. This
was another reason why helping her was so important to us.</p>
<p>Cynthia travelled back and forth from Negril to Montego Bay almost every day
for 6 weeks and several times a week for another 4 or 5 weeks to get tests and
get 20 rounds of radiation treatment. I emailed the doctor and stayed in touch
and let him know this lady was struggling with costs and we were trying to
help. They actually helped her get some treatment at no cost and gave her
credit to get through all the treatment needed. In all this time her business
at the market was also not earning any money with all this time and effort
focused on her travelling to Montego Bay.</p>
<p>We donated a small website for their market to help bring more visitors which
they say has helped: <a href=""http://rutlandpoint.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rutland Point Crafters Market</a> <a href=""http://www.rutlandpoint.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rutlandpoint.com</a></p>
<p>In total Terri and I have donated in excess of $1,500 ourselves and the
Rotary club I am part of graciously held a raffle to help and raised another
$600.</p>
<p>We are pleased to say at this point Cynthia is being told the Cancer appears
to be gone and will need to have more tests and follow up checkups. At this
point we need to raise another $1,000 to help her pay off approximately $300 US
to existing medical costs, another $200 for further testing and checkups, $100
US for travel to get back and forth to Montego Bay and at least another $200US
to take the pressure off and help them get their bills at home caught up and
get them back on their feet again. In Canadian dollars this is approximately
$1,000 and that is why we are reaching out to those who know us and others who
would like to help in a good cause to raise this amount.</p>
<p>We are not suggesting you donate a large amount, even $20 helps if we get
enough people.</p>

<div>Hi friends!  We are the midwives of Central Florida and we are reaching out to our community of supporters for help with an incredible, very exciting, and bigger-than-ever campaign for out-of-hospital birth RIGHT HERE in Central Florida!  Billboards promoting the SAFETY of out-of-hospital birth have never before been seen by the public in Greater Orlando.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>We, YOUR midwives, have decided it's time to come together and make this happen!  We need ALL of you, our community of out-of-hospital birth supporters, to contribute towards this project so we can get these billboards up by this May!  YOUR contribution will make this message reach the largest &amp; widest audience it EVER has in Central Florida!  We are gratefully asking you to help us with this project! Please give up your Starbuck runs this week ;-) and help the midwives fund these billboards!</div> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><span>We need to raise $10,000 in the next 30 days to get the billboards up all across Central Florida!  It is a big goal!  We need your help with this initial expense.  The midwives are contributing separately in order to keep these billboards up for at least 4 months.  It is a big expense because we are all individual small practices compared to the large hospitals and their ad campaign budgets.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>ALL of your contributions will go directly towards this initial expense to get the billboards up in multiple zip codes throughout Central Florida.  We came up with some contribution levels and some small, but meaningful, ""perks"" (Facebook shout-outs, lunch with the midwives, a lovely henna party, etc) to show our community of out-of-hospital birth supporters our genuine gratitude for supporting us and helping this BIG idea come to fruition.  We humbly hope that you are ALL willing to contribute at these levels so we can make a large-scale impact here in our Central Florida community.</span></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3> <p>Having a campaign such as this right here in Central Florida will finally work to change the perception of out-of-hospital birth to one that includes SAFETY and GOOD outcomes.  We know that out-of-hospital birth statistics are backed by sound evidence and we feel it's time to boldly take that message to the public in a very visible way.  Hospital corporations spend tens of thousands of dollars each year on advertising their safety and care.  Your contribution will help us make a *real* impact in saying that Out-Of-Hospital Birth <span style="""">ALSO = SAFETY &amp; GOOD OUTCOMES!</span></p>
<p>We are not doing this alone, we have partnered with Cristen Pascucci, national birth advocate and vice president of the Improving Birth organization and founder of Birth Monopoly, to help with this very important and impactful campaign.  With her help, we are ready to position Greater Orlando as a leader in out-of-hospital birth as we have one of the highest concentrations of midwives in the state.  <br/></p>
<p>We strongly feel the women &amp; families of Central Florida should have easy access to out-of-hospital birth <span style="""">statistics and evidence-based information.  To do this we are working on a brand-new, comprehensive website specifically focused for Central Florida that will include the research to back our message as well as provide a local out-of-hospital provider directory.  This website will go live before May and will be up on every billboard.  </span></p>
<p>Imagine for a moment that you're driving down the road and in addition to seeing a big hospital billboard, you see a billboard promoting out-of-hospital birth and midwifery care!  You see these billboards every day on your drive positioned in various zip codes throughout Central Florida!  Imagine the joy you will feel, as passionate birth and women advocates, to know that all the other cars driving next to you, in front of you, and behind you are seeing the same thing!  It's time...it's time!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3> <p>We are well aware that there are out-of-hospital birth opponents that may take this opportunity to delude the public about statistics and about what licensed midwives do.  We plan to boldly make the statement that most of these claims are based on a single, flawed study (the Wax paper) that does not accurately represent ""planned"" out-of-hospital birth with ""licensed"" practitioners.  We feel in integrity with our profession, serving our community as Florida Licensed Midwives, and we no longer wish to stand in the shadows of misconceptions and misinformation.  Our safety &amp; outcomes are backed by sound evidence and our model of care has the best maternal &amp; infant mortality statistics across the globe!</p> </div> <div> <h3>More Ways You Can Help</h3> <p><span style="""">Please help us spread the word about the Central Florida Out-of-Hospital Birth Billboard campaign by sharing it with EVERYONE!  Your passion and excitement will be contageous and it will help generate buzz around what we're doing here!  We have the next 30 days to raise these funds.  We humbly and gratefully ask that you please SHARE this on Facebook and Twitter as many times as you can with as many 'groups' and 'pages' as you can!  </span></p>

What We Need & What You Get We need to raise $10,000 in the next 30 days to get the billboards up all across Central Florida!  It is a big goal!  We need your help with this initial expense.  The midwives are contributing separately in order to keep these billboards up for at least 4 months.  It is a big expense because we are all individual small practices compared to the large hospitals and their ad campaign budgets.ALL of your contributions will go directly towards this initial expense to get the billboards up in multiple zip codes throughout Central Florida.  We came up with some contribution levels and some small, but meaningful, ""perks"" (Facebook shout-outs, lunch with the midwives, a lovely henna party, etc) to show our community of out-of-hospital birth supporters our genuine gratitude for supporting us and helping this BIG idea come to fruition.  We humbly hope that you are ALL willing to contribute at these levels so we can make a large-scale impact here in our Central Florida community.   The Impact
 Having a campaign such as this right here in Central Florida will finally work to change the perception of out-of-hospital birth to one that includes SAFETY and GOOD outcomes.  We know that out-of-hospital birth statistics are backed by sound evidence and we feel it's time to boldly take that message to the public in a very visible way.  Hospital corporations spend tens of thousands of dollars each year on advertising their safety and care.  Your contribution will help us make a *real* impact in saying that Out-Of-Hospital Birth ALSO = SAFETY & GOOD OUTCOMES!
We are not doing this alone, we have partnered with Cristen Pascucci, national birth advocate and vice president of the Improving Birth organization and founder of Birth Monopoly, to help with this very important and impactful campaign.  With her help, we are ready to position Greater Orlando as a leader in out-of-hospital birth as we have one of the highest concentrations of midwives in the state.  
We strongly feel the women & families of Central Florida should have easy access to out-of-hospital birth statistics and evidence-based information.  To do this we are working on a brand-new, comprehensive website specifically focused for Central Florida that will include the research to back our message as well as provide a local out-of-hospital provider directory.  This website will go live before May and will be up on every billboard.  
Imagine for a moment that you're driving down the road and in addition to seeing a big hospital billboard, you see a billboard promoting out-of-hospital birth and midwifery care!  You see these billboards every day on your drive positioned in various zip codes throughout Central Florida!  Imagine the joy you will feel, as passionate birth and women advocates, to know that all the other cars driving next to you, in front of you, and behind you are seeing the same thing!  It's time...it's time!   Challenges We are well aware that there are out-of-hospital birth opponents that may take this opportunity to delude the public about statistics and about what licensed midwives do.  We plan to boldly make the statement that most of these claims are based on a single, flawed study (the Wax paper) that does not accurately represent ""planned"" out-of-hospital birth with ""licensed"" practitioners.  We feel in integrity with our profession, serving our community as Florida Licensed Midwives, and we no longer wish to stand in the shadows of misconceptions and misinformation.  Our safety & outcomes are backed by sound evidence and our model of care has the best maternal & infant mortality statistics across the globe!   More Ways You Can Help Please help us spread the word about the Central Florida Out-of-Hospital Birth Billboard campaign by sharing it with EVERYONE!  Your passion and excitement will be contageous and it will help generate buzz around what we're doing here!  We have the next 30 days to raise these funds.  We humbly and gratefully ask that you please SHARE this on Facebook and Twitter as many times as you can with as many 'groups' and 'pages' as you can!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Within Marin County, California, a population with extremely high breast cancer rates, we have identified a subgroup of women who do not get breast cancer. This campaign funds the next step towards understanding the mechanism of this protection, with the ultimate objective of devising a breast cancer prevention strategy applicable to all women.

""Preventing breast cancer is the single most important thing we can do in terms of breast cancer research. Until now, there haven’t been enough truly promising leads. We owe it to all women to build on these findings.""

Francine Halberg, MD 
Radiation Oncologist  Marin Cancer Institute 

Breast cancer rates are increasing worldwide, and there are now almost 2 million new cases every year. We need to move this research forward as quickly and as efficiently as possible. The next step of our research plan is ready to go, and costs have been minimized by eliminating administrative overhead, and by our researchers working on this project without compensation.


The Project is being led by Mark Powell, MD, MPH who worked for 10 years as a researcher for the Marin Women's Study, a large breast cancer study funded by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Avon Foundation. He was the Principal Investigator for 5 years on Avon-funded studies that identified women with naturally occurring breast cancer protection, and has identified a key gene that is critical to the process. The current proposed study is a collaboration between Dr. Powell and Dr. Christopher Benz, Director of the Cancer & Developmental Therapeutics Program at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, and will be performed in the California Teachers Study (CTS) with the help of Dr. Peggy Reynolds, Senior Researcher at the CTS. The Project Team includes public health professionals, community organizations, advocates, survivors, oncologists, statisticians, epidemiologists, and academic researchers working together to find a solution.

“What’s been a very interesting spin-off of the Marin Women’s Study has been finding that some women can actually be protected from breast cancer. We think with this biological clue we can design new and very innovative breast cancer prevention strategies that could be be applied to all women.”

Christopher Benz, MD

BUDGET:
STRETCH GOALS:$120,000:  Obtain 150 breast tissue specimens from the Komen Tissue Bank from women with and without a history of pregnancy-induced hypertension, and DNA from their blood. This will include proper matching of cases and controls, all necessary data for analyses, and copies of available mammograms.
$180,000:  Perform microscopic and immuno-histochemical analysis of the breast tissue to identify differences in total and activated IGF1R expression, and microscopic examination of epithelium, fat, and stromal constituents in women with and without natural breast cancer protection as differentiated by SNP analyses (begin to identify the differences in the breast tissue of women with naturally occurring breast cancer protection).
$240,000:  This will enable RNA extraction from breast tissue samples and microarray RNA analysis using the Agilent or Affymetrix platforms to enable more complete genome transcriptome analyses, permitting determination of an activated gene signature score (more definition of the differences at a cellular/molecular level).$400,000:  The gold standard in this type of research is full sequencing, or RNAseq analysis, which permits allele-specific gene transcript analysis, and would include the necessary extensive bioinformatic analyses (most complete identification of the changes that have occurred in women with breast cancer protection, and how this differs from women without protection).>$400,000:  Begin the process of applying the identified protective changes to all women (many doors to funding will likely have opened by this point).",2.0,0,"1 Campaign
