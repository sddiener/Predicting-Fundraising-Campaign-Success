</h3> <p></p>
<p>Hi! We’re <i>Sorte</i>, an independent and homemade brand based in
Maracaibo, Venezuela. Our team consists of three friends (Marcela Arends, Michelle and Omer Paz) all students in our early-twenties, looking to create and share with others our skills as
graphic designers. We produce our pieces from design to print. We’re mostly inspired by things that surround us and represent
our culture, as well as interesting things we see form other cultures around
the world, which we eventually turn into original and new designs for our
clothes. </p>
<p>Through our art, we
want to promote values such as equality, tolerance and respect towards others.
We also want to show a good work ethic and discipline. <br/></p>
<p>Every piece we fabricate
is made with passion. Yet, the problems we currently face in our country make
everything very difficult, especially for honest, young students as us who want
to start new creative projects. Because of the economic crisis we live in, the
lack of materials makes it impossible for us to grow as a Screen Printing
workshop and a brand, for that matter. We started off very
humbly, with a very low budget. We basically took all we had in our pockets and kept going from there. Even our equipment was made at home.</p>
<p>We’ve worked hard and
given all our love to this project of ours. By contributing to this cause,
you’ll be helping is grow as a strong consolidated business. With your donation,
we will be able to buy the necessary equipment that will allow us to keep
going.</p>
<b>Items included are: </b>Screen printing equipments &amp; materials in general, Station Screen Press, Flash Dryer, Washout Tank , UV Exposure Unit Kit, Photosensitive Emulsion, Emulsion Scoop Coater, Transparency, Screen Frame, 120 Mesh Count, Aluminum Foil Tape, Pallet Adhesive, Pallet Adhesive Scraper, Water-based Inks, Spatulas, Clean Up Cards, Squeegees, Emulsion Remover Powder, T-shirts, Fabrics, Thread serger sewing machine, etc.<br/><br/>

<h3>Nuestra historia

<p>¡Hola! Somos <i>Sorte</i>, una pequeña marca ubicada
en Maracaibo, Venezuela que se inspira en diferentes culturas, cosas que nos
rodean para crear divertidos diseños y luego estamparlos en diferentes
materiales. Trabajamos principalmente con franelas, bolsos, faldas y ropa
interior. </p>
<p>Somos una organización independiente, producimos nuestras piezas  desde el diseño hasta el estampado, inspirándonos en
tendencias actuales para crear un producto de calidad y a su vez 100% hecho en
casa con todo el cariño del mundo.

</p>
<p>Este proyecto inició con tres amigos (Marcela Arends, Michelle y
 Omer Paz) todos jóvenes estudiantes, buscando mostrar sus capacidades 
trabajando como un
equipo creativo, además de la pasión por el diseño y la moda.<br/><br/>Comenzamos con un presupuesto muy bajo, tomamos lo que había en nuestros bolsillos y desde ahí comenzó a andar la idea. Nos encanta la humildad de nuestro taller, porque nos recuerda quienes somos y como comenzó la idea, que es un producto hecho en casa. Sin embargo, queremos perfeccionar nuestro producto y con las herramientas que contamos en este momento no se nos hace posible, nuestro país pasa por una crisis económica grande, y la venta de nuestras piezas apenas alcanza para la compra de material. La alta demanda y poca producción actual genera desabastecimiento y una inflación descontrolada, haciendo que en menos de 24 horas los productos aumenten su precio en un 100%, y a su vez reduciendo la posibilidad de conseguirlos.<br/></p>
<p>Con mucho amor, nos
hemos esforzado para lograr que este proyecto naciera. Tu contribución nos ayudará a seguir creciendo como empresa y
marca, a armar un taller de serigrafía mucho mas competente para así poder

And that's just for basic caption T's.  Looking for an all-over print, or discharge work (Ink in the shirt and not plastisol), the costs go up...and your definitely talking about a minimum quantity order...  With JOJUBO-Apparel, you get unique prints, at affordable prices not driven by supply and demand.  Even as our line gains in popularity, our prices will NOT increase to match!  ((Make sure to Read our FAQ's at the bottom))</span></font></p>

<h2>FAQ's</h2>
<p></p>
<h5>How do I choose my sizes?</h5>
<p>​At the end of the campaign everyone who ordered will receive an email to confirm sizes and selections, however we will also be sending emails during the campaign to collect this information prior.  We want everyone to receive their shirts before the Christmas holiday, with a delivery goal of December, 15th.  This means we need accurate mailing, gender, and size choices as soon as possible. </p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>How do I order more than one design?</h5>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Just select them individually.  This allows us to ensure that we do not exceed the maximum prints to be released. You will notice some offers include more than 1 shirt to help minimize the need for multiple orders</span></p>
<h5>Can you produce in time?</h5>
<p>​Yes!  Our chosen facility for the Artistic prints has over 30 years experience in custom printing and in-house fulfillment capabilities (they ship directly to you.), and a manufacturing capability of 20,000 shirts a week.</p>
<p>Our chosen facility for the caption t's has over 10 years experience with 2 distribution centers, in-house fulfillment ability, and a capacity of 50,000 shirts a week.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h5>Why Only Limited Prints?</h5>
<p>​<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Limited prints means that the </span>likely-hood<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> of seeing a multitude of people wearing your same shirt is greatly reduced.  Limited prints means that you can be unique, and among a special few.</span></p>
<p></p>
<h5>Will Limited Prints Mean Higher Costs?</h5>
<p><span>NOPE!  Now a days if you want something original or not seen everyday, you have to pay big bucks.  Whether your paying for your own development, or paying a large amount of money because few others will, the bottom line is your paying a lot of money...not with JOJUBO-Apparel.  We will continually offer great caption and Artistic T's, at affordable prices no matter how limited the supply or how popular we become.</span></p>
<p></p>
<h5><span>Why Crowdfunding?</span></h5>
<h5>
<span style=""font-size: 1em; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em;"">Crowdfunding makes it possible to offer unique prints without the cost of stocking inventory upfront, or the risk of money spent on non-performing designs.  Plus it allows for people to make </span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">their</span><span style=""font-size: 1em; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em;""> choices and receive their shirts regardless of the items popularity.</span><span style=""font-weight: normal; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"">  Yes there is a small delay from ordering till delivery, but as a small company this allows us to keep profitable until such time where we can </span><span style=""font-weight: normal; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"">​pre-order inventory for immediate shipping ability.</span>
</h5>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h5>Will you ever make previous prints available again if I miss the first offer?</h5>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We want our artists to find exposure through JOJUBO-Apparel. If a </span>particular<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> design does not reach it's maximum release count of 2000 shirts, then they may be made available for purchase directly from our <a href=""www.jojubo-appare.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""www.jojubo-apparel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.jojubo-apparel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">site</a> (We suggest you get them here while you can...free shipping within the US and lower cost) ...The caption screen printed T's - we might re-offer the most popular, once more the following year, so make sure to like our Facebook page and submit to the site to be kept up to date. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h5>Will the Quality of the Shirts Vary? </h5>
<p>While some Printers offer different types of shirts, quality is our NUMBER ONE concern.  The Screen Caption shirts will be sturdy Gildan cotton shirts, utilizing ultra-soft plastisol screen printing.  This method of printing allows the shirt to move naturally with barely any restrictions from the over-lay.  The Artistic T's will be printed on Next Level shirts using discharge printing techniques.  The technique places the artwork directly into the fabric of the garment and offers a high level of detail, no plastisol!  Next Level shirts or known for their soft feel and form fitting style!</p>.<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","JOJUBO-Apparel is here! 

JOJUBO-Apparel is a clothing line dedicated to two ideas:


Clothing that lets you speak out-loud without saying a word.


And


A platform for Artists to offer signed, limited edition, unique custom works.


Why Buy JOJUBO-Apparel?
     Our caption screen printed T's can be bought for self-expression, given as a gift, or just enjoyed for the words and feel. Our Artistic-Signature shirts provide you the opportunity to own unique apparel that will not be found everywhere you look. Large retailers can have 1000's of locations, with a 100 prints or more per store.  That's hundreds-of-thousands of shirts, and suddenly your style became that guy's, and that guy's,and........
     JOJUBO's limited edition apparel means that these shirts will only be owned by a select few, and when they are gone, That's It! Our shirts will always be made with quality material and printing processes to ensure durability, comfort, and style.
     Being unique can be costly in today's world. Creating your own shirt costs lots of money, especially if you only want one!  There's generally a set-up fee per color screen ($20-$30 per color screen), and minimum order amounts... And that's just for basic caption T's.  Looking for an all-over print, or discharge work (Ink in the shirt and not plastisol), the costs go up...and your definitely talking about a minimum quantity order...  With JOJUBO-Apparel, you get unique prints, at affordable prices not driven by supply and demand.  Even as our line gains in popularity, our prices will NOT increase to match!  ((Make sure to Read our FAQ's at the bottom))

Helping the Artistic Community:
     JOJUBO-Apparel is dedicated to helping artists gain exposure in ways they might otherwise not find available.  There are many great artists around the world but only a select few become widely known, or are commissioned to have their works provided on multiple media. JOJUBO offers artists a way to have their work brought to the public on a national and possibly global scale. By placing these works on shirts, thousands of people far and wide, will be introduced to their talents. The more popular we can make JOJUBO-Apparel, the better the exposure we can generate for our Artists. Imagine owning a limited edition, signed T-shirt, before they became well-known.       The best part, is that it costs them (the artists) nothing to be featured!  In-fact they make money for every print, both their works and a portion of each caption-T, sold. We might not make them millionaires, but we can keep them from starving!
Your chance to win ""Free"" JOJUBO-Appare! At 50 orders, we will hold a drawing for a Free shirt of your choice, for a randomly selected buyer. At 100 orders we will be holding a secondary drawing where one lucky winner will get 6 Free Artistic T's. We will hold additional drawings for every 100 orders we receive before the campaign ends. Your name will go into the drawing once for each shirt purchased. Those who have already made purchases, are already entered.

​Yes!  Our chosen facility for the Artistic prints has over 30 years experience in custom printing and in-house fulfillment capabilities (they ship directly to you.), and a manufacturing capability of 20,000 shirts a week.
Our chosen facility for the caption t's has over 10 years experience with 2 distribution centers, in-house fulfillment ability, and a capacity of 50,000 shirts a week.



Why Only Limited Prints?
​Limited prints means that the likely-hood of seeing a multitude of people wearing your same shirt is greatly reduced.  Limited prints means that you can be unique, and among a special few.

Will Limited Prints Mean Higher Costs?
NOPE!  Now a days if you want something original or not seen everyday, you have to pay big bucks.  Whether your paying for your own development, or paying a large amount of money because few others will, the bottom line is your paying a lot of money...not with JOJUBO-Apparel.  We will continually offer great caption and Artistic T's, at affordable prices no matter how limited the supply or how popular we become.

Why Crowdfunding?

Crowdfunding makes it possible to offer unique prints without the cost of stocking inventory upfront, or the risk of money spent on non-performing designs.  Plus it allows for people to make their choices and receive their shirts regardless of the items popularity.  Yes there is a small delay from ordering till delivery, but as a small company this allows us to keep profitable until such time where we can ​pre-order inventory for immediate shipping ability.



Will you ever make previous prints available again if I miss the first offer?
We want our artists to find exposure through JOJUBO-Apparel. If a particular design does not reach it's maximum release count of 2000 shirts, then they may be made available for purchase directly from our site (We suggest you get them here while you can...free shipping within the US and lower cost) ...The caption screen printed T's - we might re-offer the most popular, once more the following year, so make sure to like our Facebook page and submit to the site to be kept up to date. 


Will the Quality of the Shirts Vary? 
While some Printers offer different types of shirts, quality is our NUMBER ONE concern.  The Screen Caption shirts will be sturdy Gildan cotton shirts, utilizing ultra-soft plastisol screen printing.  This method of printing allows the shirt to move naturally with barely any restrictions from the over-lay.  The Artistic T's will be printed on Next Level shirts using discharge printing techniques.  The technique places the artwork directly into the fabric of the garment and offers a high level of detail, no plastisol!  Next Level shirts or known for their soft feel and form fitting style!.",28.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>We are a bunch of young wrist watch enthusiasts. After all these years, we’ve found out that the ecology of watch business is divided into two major tiers. Decent watches with good qualities are priced at exceptionally high-priced ranges, while watches with acceptable prices are usually made with compromised qualities.</p>
<p>By lucky chance coincidence, we were introduced to the owner of a watch manufacturer, who has been in the business for more than three decades. His dedication to the business and his attitude of never just being satisfied with qualities makes us feel like we have been friends for years. This enlightened us to build our own watch company, whose purpose is to merge the two tiers and to produce high quality watches with passion, at a very reasonable price range.  Our goal is to bring quality watches to the public so that everyone can share our joy of being a watch lover.</p>This is how DELTAt is born. “DELTA” is the measure of change, and “t” denotes time. Together, DELTAt symbols the change of time.</div><h1>Product – SoRa, the pilot watch</h1><p>Amongst all categories of watches, the pilot watch has played a very important role in wrist watches’ history. During World War I, bomber pilots relied heavily on watches’ accuracy for assistance in precise navigation for coordinated attacks, in turn this advanced the whole watch industry for at least 10 years!</p><p>Although pilot watches are unique in the watch family, it is surprising that it has never established a standard. So we decided to define a standard for pilot watches:</p><p><b>Size</b> - A pilot watch must be read with ease, so it must have a big dial.</p><p><b>Large Crown</b> - Pilots wear gloves when driving aircrafts, so the crown must be specially designed.</p><p><b>Precise Time Setting </b>- Pilots need to set time precisely, even up to seconds, so good quality movements with hacking seconds function is a must.</p><p><b>Long Strap</b><span><b>s </b>-<b> </b>Pilots may wear their watches on flight jackets’ sleeves.</span></p><p> </p><h2> </h2><p> </p><h2><span>SoRa Pilot Watch<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DT0IuIXUrl0k%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FT0IuIXUrl0k&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div></span></h2><p><span>With the above standards as the baseline of design in mind, we came up with the perfect pilot watch, the SoRa.</span></p><p><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132289/files/20150105053608-Sketches.jpg?1420464968"" src="""" style=""width: 617.753px;height: 463px;""/></span></p><blockquote><p><span>Initial Sketch of the SoRa.</span></p></blockquote><p><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132295/files/20150105053835-Cover.jpg?1420465115"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p><h3>Case</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132316/files/20150105054856-CaseBluePrint01.jpg?1420465736"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132317/files/20150105054913-CaseBluePrint02.jpg?1420465753"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/><span>SoRa's case measuring 44mm in diameter. With a 38mm diameter dial, time reading on SoRa is very easy. SoRa uses 316L Stainless Steel as its case and bottom cover's material. 316L Stainless Steel is a surgical grade material. Not only because it is very hard and free from corrosion, it also contains much less nickel that does not trigger an allergic reaction to sensitive skins.<br/>The shape of SoRa may seem simple. However, the simpler the design is, the harder it is to make it perfect. In order to have SoRa brushed thoroughly, we divided the case into two parts (which increases the cost quite a bit), the bezel and the body, so that every surface of the case can be brushed perfectly, and every edge of the case can be so shapely defined. Every line and curve is carefully designed with its necessity and beauty, and they all add up to form the case of a minimalist's perfect pilot watch.</span></p><p> </p><p><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132341/files/20150105060648-DSCN3914.JPG?1420466808"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132342/files/20150105060738-BezelBody.jpg?1420466858"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p><p> </p><h3><span>Crown</span></h3><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132365/files/20150105062615-image5897.png?1420467975"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132367/files/20150105062705-CrownBluePrint.jpg?1420468025"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>SoRa's large crown, with cross-diagonal pattern, measuring 10mm in diameter and 5mm in height makes it easily accessible even with gloves on.

Mechanical movements not only represent the inheritance of watchmakers' tradition, they are the essence of over 500 years of watch history. You can't imagine how difficult it is to measure one second precisely by pure mechanical instruments, especially if compares to electronic devices. This craftsmanship alone is considered as a form of art.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132426/files/20150105072616-BalanceWheel.gif?1420471576"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132427/files/20150105072636-DSCN3712.jpg?1420471596"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>SoRa uses the Japan Time Module Automatic Movement cal. NH37 from Seiko. If the movement is the heart of a wrist watch, then the balance-spring is the soul of the movement. NH37 can be wound manually or automatically by its rotor.

About Us
We are a bunch of young wrist watch enthusiasts. After all these years, we’ve found out that the ecology of watch business is divided into two major tiers. Decent watches with good qualities are priced at exceptionally high-priced ranges, while watches with acceptable prices are usually made with compromised qualities.
By lucky chance coincidence, we were introduced to the owner of a watch manufacturer, who has been in the business for more than three decades. His dedication to the business and his attitude of never just being satisfied with qualities makes us feel like we have been friends for years. This enlightened us to build our own watch company, whose purpose is to merge the two tiers and to produce high quality watches with passion, at a very reasonable price range.  Our goal is to bring quality watches to the public so that everyone can share our joy of being a watch lover.This is how DELTAt is born. “DELTA” is the measure of change, and “t” denotes time. Together, DELTAt symbols the change of time.Product – SoRa, the pilot watchAmongst all categories of watches, the pilot watch has played a very important role in wrist watches’ history. During World War I, bomber pilots relied heavily on watches’ accuracy for assistance in precise navigation for coordinated attacks, in turn this advanced the whole watch industry for at least 10 years!Although pilot watches are unique in the watch family, it is surprising that it has never established a standard. So we decided to define a standard for pilot watches:Size - A pilot watch must be read with ease, so it must have a big dial.Large Crown - Pilots wear gloves when driving aircrafts, so the crown must be specially designed.Precise Time Setting - Pilots need to set time precisely, even up to seconds, so good quality movements with hacking seconds function is a must.Long Straps - Pilots may wear their watches on flight jackets’ sleeves.   SoRa Pilot WatchWith the above standards as the baseline of design in mind, we came up with the perfect pilot watch, the SoRa.Initial Sketch of the SoRa.CaseSoRa's case measuring 44mm in diameter. With a 38mm diameter dial, time reading on SoRa is very easy. SoRa uses 316L Stainless Steel as its case and bottom cover's material. 316L Stainless Steel is a surgical grade material. Not only because it is very hard and free from corrosion, it also contains much less nickel that does not trigger an allergic reaction to sensitive skins.The shape of SoRa may seem simple. However, the simpler the design is, the harder it is to make it perfect. In order to have SoRa brushed thoroughly, we divided the case into two parts (which increases the cost quite a bit), the bezel and the body, so that every surface of the case can be brushed perfectly, and every edge of the case can be so shapely defined. Every line and curve is carefully designed with its necessity and beauty, and they all add up to form the case of a minimalist's perfect pilot watch.    Crown SoRa's large crown, with cross-diagonal pattern, measuring 10mm in diameter and 5mm in height makes it easily accessible even with gloves on. While being big, its size is carefully designed so that it doesn't jab into your wrist's skin. MovementIn order to be collectable, a wrist watch must use a mechanical movement. Mechanical movements not only represent the inheritance of watchmakers' tradition, they are the essence of over 500 years of watch history. You can't imagine how difficult it is to measure one second precisely by pure mechanical instruments, especially if compares to electronic devices. This craftsmanship alone is considered as a form of art. SoRa uses the Japan Time Module Automatic Movement cal. NH37 from Seiko. If the movement is the heart of a wrist watch, then the balance-spring is the soul of the movement. NH37 can be wound manually or automatically by its rotor. It also features the hacking seconds function, which allows you to set time precisely up to the second.   StrapsSoRa comes with 3 set of extra-long straps:
Genuine Fine Crazy Horse Leather straps with removable base.
Genuine Fine Leather Straps.
Military Style Nylon Straps.
Extra-long genuine fine Crazy Horse leather straps with removable base.  Extra-long genuine fine leather straps. Extra-long military style Nylon strap.Wearing SoRa on the pilot jacket's sleeve.The double-sided Crazy Horse leather straps and the Nylon strap is very nice and elegant. Paired with SoRa, they make the watch beyond an instrument of chronology. It becomes an icon of fashion! To help you enjoy changing the straps of SoRa, we implemented the tooless-strap-changing system into SoRa, Changing straps for SoRa will never be easier.We do not stop just because we have met the standard of pilot watches. We push the standard to a new level in every aspect of the SoRa, and make sure it is a wrist watch with premium value:Crystal SoRa uses Sapphire Crsytal with anti-reflective coating. Sapphire Crystal is the second hardest natural mineral on earth. Rated 9 at Mohs Scale, only after diamond. A material will be scratched only by materials that are harder than itself, so the chance of Sapphire Crystal being scratched is very low. Therefore, Sapphire Crystal is highly scratch resistance. It has become the standard of luxury wrist watches.Water Resistant Although SoRa is a pilot watch, we want you to be able to wear it as much as you want to, so that we make it water resistant to 200 meter/660 feet. There is no reason to leave your SoRa at home.Bottom Cover SoRa's screw-in bottom cover is made of 316L Stainless Steel. A bi-plane and a serial number is engraved on the bottom cover.Indiegogo Exclusive EditionEach model of the SoRa will have 20 pieces of the Indiegogo Exclusive Edition, which has the traditional aviation arrow engraved on the bottom cover. The letter ""A"" followed by the broad arrow were used by the British bomber pilots in the First World War. The ""A"" represents aviation or air force, and the arrow represent the British War Department. ModelsSoRa has 4 models, 1939, Stealth, Drone, and Eagle. Each model has PVD and Steel variations.1939 Stealth Drone Eagle Warranty Card Each SoRa comes with a dog tag as the warranty card.SpecificationsMovement:

Environmental issuesSince the Industrial revolution began, the Fashion industry has become the 4th highest polluting industry of the world.

About 19.6% of total industrial waste comes from the fashion industry alone.             Social
issues

Fashion industry looks clean from one's first glance but has a truly a dark side when one digs deeper.

Here, at Nobre we don't just believe in selling a product, we rather believe in giving an experience and spread moral values.

Nobre knows the pain of waiting days for your
order to come home and finding it does not fits you, You just say “This is
Insane man!”. That’s why we thought of creating a software for our website that
will guide you with the best fit for your unique body shape. It really simple and consists of
only 3 simple steps.                    There are about 1.3 million
orphans in the world. Alone and scared, they don’t need sympathy they need a
helping hand. Every year Nobre individually donates 10% from its net sales for this noble cause.Working the SPHOORTI FOUNDATION in Hyderabad we give every resource we have to bring a smile and a hope
for this unprivileged kids. if every individual of us commits to help a single
orphan we believe the day  is not far when no orphan will feel lonely, no
more tears in their sweet eyes, no more pain and more hungry nights. we believe
our small steps will change the world because the people who think they can
change the world are the one's who do.After working years in fashion industry Rachit and Prateek found the fashion industry has very serious issues which needs to solved. Having experienced both the hardships
of the 3rd world and the comfort of the 1st, they desired to create something that could bridge that gap and ultimately make the world a better place.



             
We have worked tirelessly on this project for the past
years, and after finalizing everything from product design, supporting
charities, & change metrics the only part left is YOU!  




                     



As a donor, you can receive
any of the following perks. 
If you really want a
life-changing experience, come with our team to India to see the change
happening! (All Expenses Paid- See $5000 perk)    













                 


                


 


When will my perk be delivered?
Expected delivery ; November
We know you want to show off your Nobre, so we are working hard to get them manufactured and ready to ship as soon as possible. We refuse to send you anything but the highest quality product! 
Please note that due to overwhelming demand, these are our best estimations. We will contact you via Indiegogo update and direct email with exact dates after our campaign. We cannot tell you an exact date at this point.


Is there a charge for International Shipping?

Yes, there will need to be an additional charge to ship internationally. It costs $10 per product to ship to international addresses.  Please include that in the checkout price.  If you forget, we'll contact you prior to shipping to finalize those details.
If you have any specific questions about your location, please email us at team@nobreclothings.in

Is there a warranty on Nobre's products?
Yes. There is a 1-year warranty. If you want to raise the warranty to 5 year you can add by purchasing perk of $10. If there are any defects, our repair center will fix it or replace it. However, we strive to provide the highest quality materials so this will not be an issue.

Is Nobre available in retail stores of U.S?

Not yet, but soon! Nobre will be in retail stores in first months of 2015. 

What percentage of donations go to the charities?
Each Nobre comes with a metric which is carried out with the purchase of the products.  We want to make the business model as transparent as possible and never want you to have to ask the question ""And then what?""  With that said we will not only tell you what, we will show you what!
For example, for every Shirt purchased, it will provide 5 children in the India with food supplements and we will plant 4 tress in your name.  The same holds true for each of the other metrics. The goal is to create an actual quantified change in people's lives around the world for each watch sold.

Where is Nobre manufactured?
The Products are designed and manufactured in Nagpur, India. The facility has passed the SA8000 (Social Accountability) and ISO14000 (Environmental) audits. Furthermore, our manufacturing facility is ROHS compliant.

RISKS AND CHALLENGESThis is a new venture for me, and as such I am prepared to encounter obstacles along the way and challenges that I am sure will come with the process.  Some things that could prevent delays in fulfillment could be that the weavers can't weave fast enough, materials run out, or anything we are not prepared for.  I am working with professionals who have years of experience and knowledge that will resolve issues should they occur as I try my best to avoid any delays that arise.If there are any unforeseen circumstances that delay the work, I will keep an open and honest communication with all my backers! Duty/VAT charges: NON US RESIDENTS, you will be responsible for any applicable duty/VAT charges.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

You can create your own vases, glasses, different kind of holders, ashtrays, lamps &amp; aquariums<br/><p></p>
<h4><span>Luca Cutter is not only a cutter, Luca Cutter is possibility</span></h4>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3><span>Why Luca Cutter</span></h3>
<p>Most bottle cutter in the market can only cut straight line, but Luca Cutter cut both CURVES and Straight. That's why you can make your glass products to any shape as you want.  The adjustable blade and four legs design make it fits for bottles with any diameters. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>Luca Cutter is a Hand-held tool, it is easy to operate and carry around.  Ergonomic design makes the cutting process more efficient and easy.</span></p>
<p><span>The minimalist design of Luca Cutter makes it be a great decoration. <br/></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/907238/files/20141006022307-IMG_2486.JPG?1412587387"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Luca Cutter is made of high quality plywood. All parts are made by laser cutting to ensure high consistence and accuracy.</p>
<p>Give new meanings to beautiful empty bottles by reusing &amp; rebuilding them by Luca Cutter.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>With the use of Luca cutter and straight line kit set, you are able to make 4 kinds of glass products: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Bottles with curve cut</p></li>
<li><p>Bottles with straight cut</p></li>
<li><p>Flat glass/mirror with curve cut</p></li>
<li>Flat glass/mirror with straight cut.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h4>What do you think, what will you get</h4>
</div><h3><br/></h3>
<div>
<h3><span>How does it work</span></h3>
<p>Luca cutter does not actually cut the bottle/flat glass. It makes a score line on the bottle/flat glass by the blade. With exerting heat on it, the thermal expansion will split the bottle exactly on the score line.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/907155/files/20141006015326-IMG_2489.JPG?1412585606"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>The blade of Luca Cutter comes with ball bearing which enables it to turn freely.  When the cutter leans, the blade turns to the same direction of leaning. <br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Besides, four legs design of the Luca Cutter confines the position of blade and bottle/flat glass. It prevents the blade from slipping and keeps steady leaning. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Combining four legs structure and blade with ball bearing ensures cutting the bottle/flat glass in all directions smoothly, steadily and efficiently.  That's why curves can be easily cut by Luca Cutter. </span><br/></p>
</div>

<br/>

<div>
<h3><span>4 steps to make your glass product</span></h3>
<br/><h4>1.  Adjust your cutter</h4>
<ul><li><p>Curve cut</p></li></ul>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/BG-BT6Jspko?list=UU3Nn9SeDyLDb-mcCqfywASQ"" width=""640""></iframe></div><br/><p>Use marker to sketch the shape you would like to cut. Place the cutter on the bottle/flat glass with 4 legs, adjust the blade until it contacts with the bottle/flat glass and lift the cutter a bit above the bottle/flat glass, the purpose is for leaning of the cutter. </p>
<ul><li><p>Straight cut</p></li></ul>
<p>Gear up your cutter with straight line kit set and place it on the bottle. Adjust the position of cutter and blade to the place where you want to split the bottle. </p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/gedU3AaQuHg?list=UU3Nn9SeDyLDb-mcCqfywASQ"" width=""640""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
</div>
<br/><h4>2.  Make the score line</h4>
<p>As most bottles are not perfect circle, its better to make a trial rotating of bottle with the cutter and make sure the blade keep contacting with bottle during rotates. </p>
<ul><li><p>Curve cut</p></li></ul>
<p>With leaning the cutter and rotating the bottle forwards and backwards, make the score line as the sharp you have sketched </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/907152/files/20141006015028-IMG_2507.JPG?1412585428"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul><li><p>Straight cut</p></li></ul>
<p>Make a full circle score line by slowly rolling the bottle.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/907154/files/20141006015107-IMG_2515.JPG?1412585467"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">You should hear the scratching sound by the cutter. The score line should be slightly seen and continuous.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">3.  Splitting</span></p>
<ul><li><p>Bottle</p></li></ul>
<p>Pour boiling water on the score line, then pour cold water over the score line from the faucet.  Keep repeating to pour the hot and cold water until the bottle splits.  The heating and cooling will crack the bottle along the score line. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/909665/files/20141006194221-IMG_2509.JPG?1412649741"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Only pours the water along the score line, sticky tack included in set will help to make a clear split especially on curve cut.</p>
<ul><li><p>Flat glass/mirror</p></li></ul>
<p>Use your hand or running pliers to split the flat glass/mirror along the score line. </p>
<br/><h4>4.  Finishing</h4>Sharp edge would be left on both halves after splitting the bottle. The edge can be smoothed and finished by sandpaper. There are three grit size sandpaper included in the kit set. Use 80 grit sandpaper to remove the sharp edge. Use 120 or 180 grit for smoother result. If you want to make even smoother edge, you need to buy higher grit sandpaper with glass polishing compounds in your local store. </div><div>

</div></div>","What is Luca Cutter
Luca Cutter is designed for cutting glass bottles & flat glass to ANY SHAPES! 
The wonderful design make it able to cut bottles & flat glass to any diameters and lengths. Apart from these amazing functions, Luca Cutter works excellent with the basic function of normal bottle cutters, cutting straight. Multi-function of Luca cutter gives all the possibility when you DIY your glass products and comes up with wide variety of final products.
You can create your own vases, glasses, different kind of holders, ashtrays, lamps & aquariums
Luca Cutter is not only a cutter, Luca Cutter is possibility


Why Luca Cutter
Most bottle cutter in the market can only cut straight line, but Luca Cutter cut both CURVES and Straight. That's why you can make your glass products to any shape as you want.  The adjustable blade and four legs design make it fits for bottles with any diameters. 


Luca Cutter is a Hand-held tool, it is easy to operate and carry around.  Ergonomic design makes the cutting process more efficient and easy.
The minimalist design of Luca Cutter makes it be a great decoration. 


Luca Cutter is made of high quality plywood. All parts are made by laser cutting to ensure high consistence and accuracy.
Give new meanings to beautiful empty bottles by reusing & rebuilding them by Luca Cutter.

With the use of Luca cutter and straight line kit set, you are able to make 4 kinds of glass products: 

Bottles with curve cut
Bottles with straight cut
Flat glass/mirror with curve cut
Flat glass/mirror with straight cut.


What do you think, what will you get


How does it work
Luca cutter does not actually cut the bottle/flat glass. It makes a score line on the bottle/flat glass by the blade. With exerting heat on it, the thermal expansion will split the bottle exactly on the score line.


The blade of Luca Cutter comes with ball bearing which enables it to turn freely.  When the cutter leans, the blade turns to the same direction of leaning. 
Besides, four legs design of the Luca Cutter confines the position of blade and bottle/flat glass. It prevents the blade from slipping and keeps steady leaning. 
Combining four legs structure and blade with ball bearing ensures cutting the bottle/flat glass in all directions smoothly, steadily and efficiently.  That's why curves can be easily cut by Luca Cutter. 






4 steps to make your glass product
1.  Adjust your cutter
Curve cut
Use marker to sketch the shape you would like to cut. Place the cutter on the bottle/flat glass with 4 legs, adjust the blade until it contacts with the bottle/flat glass and lift the cutter a bit above the bottle/flat glass, the purpose is for leaning of the cutter. 
Straight cut
Gear up your cutter with straight line kit set and place it on the bottle. Adjust the position of cutter and blade to the place where you want to split the bottle. 




2.  Make the score line
As most bottles are not perfect circle, its better to make a trial rotating of bottle with the cutter and make sure the blade keep contacting with bottle during rotates. 
Curve cut
With leaning the cutter and rotating the bottle forwards and backwards, make the score line as the sharp you have sketched 


Straight cut
Make a full circle score line by slowly rolling the bottle.


You should hear the scratching sound by the cutter. The score line should be slightly seen and continuous.

3.  Splitting
Bottle
Pour boiling water on the score line, then pour cold water over the score line from the faucet.  Keep repeating to pour the hot and cold water until the bottle splits.  The heating and cooling will crack the bottle along the score line. 


Only pours the water along the score line, sticky tack included in set will help to make a clear split especially on curve cut.
Flat glass/mirror
Use your hand or running pliers to split the flat glass/mirror along the score line. 
4.  FinishingSharp edge would be left on both halves after splitting the bottle. The edge can be smoothed and finished by sandpaper. There are three grit size sandpaper included in the kit set. Use 80 grit sandpaper to remove the sharp edge. Use 120 or 180 grit for smoother result. If you want to make even smoother edge, you need to buy higher grit sandpaper with glass polishing compounds in your local store.

<h2>The Starting Point of my venture</h2>
<p>I'm Lorenzo and I'm a young italian entrepreneur. I'm 28 years old and, as many people do, I've got a lot of passions. I like sports, history, literature, technology, cinema, music and fashion. At the begginning of 2013 I quit my job as engineer to start a new business on my own, even if now It's a very big challenge! </p>

<h2>The Anatomy of 1285 Collection</h2>
<p>Maybe you're wondering what this crazy guy had in his mind when he created this t-shirt collection, so let me explain why I do not need any psichologist's help!</p>
<p>The graphic technique was the first thing to be involved, because you hardly see embroidered t-shirts in the t-shirt world. On the other hand you can easily find any kind of screen/digital printed graphics in every clothing shop: all of this pushed me to make embroidered t-shirts. The embroidery technique is very particular, because It doesn't allow filling the graphics, you can only use the edge to define your figures otherwise your t-shirts would be heavier than an armor.</p>
<p><img alt=""armor's not a t-shirt"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s24.postimg.org/pm5o9ky2t/armor2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""armor's not a t-shirt""/></p>
<p>Once I had created graphics using only the drawing borders, I had to find the proper drawing style. I searched a lot and obviously the most part of the research was on the Web. It was saturday night, when I suddenly found the picture below: maybe the destiny mocked at me</p>
<p><img alt=""so much fun!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s23.postimg.org/7v441n3bv/partyrock.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""so much fun!""/></p>
<p>Those chicks were having a lot of fun wern't they? Anyway, that picture was such a flash, because in the Middle Age the drawing style had two particular features: drawings were not complex and the postures were totally insane! At that time painters didn't use perspective in their paintings, and the result were static positions even for moving subjects.</p>
<p><img alt=""I've no perspective"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s17.postimg.org/vf4xsl46n/walking2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""I've no perspective""/></p>
<p>The style was finally defined, but I didn't decide what to draw yet. I needed to find something significant to my style and original at the same time, maybe something similar to Steam Punk! Steam Punk uses complex steel and wooden machines powered by steam, bringing contemporary elements to the 19th century.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Ok, It can work, and the final step was to characterize the scene: I chose a sport theme.</p>
<p>The result was my first t-shirt, ""Solcatore di Flutti"". </p>

<h2>Why I'm on Indiegogo</h2>
<p>My campaign is for the initial funding, providing the financial resources to start up a business in Italy. Unfortunately It's not cheap to start a business here and that's why I need your help. Money will also help me to buy the very first batch of t-shirts for the online store.</p>
<p>The contributors of this campaign have the possibility to create something new and cool, an apparel that links past to present, both in the technique and in the graphic design.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>How funds will be used</h2>
<p>The funding I'm asking for is 6000$, that is the minimum I need to start the business. Of course the more I get the more resources I'll have to start in a easier way. Money earned are divided in:</p>
<p> - 40% to begin the activity (initial fees);</p>
<p>- 50% to buy the first batch of t-shirts;</p>
<p>- 10% to charity;</p>
<p> My perks are related to my activity, you'll find both gadgets and t-shirts. Part of your contribution is for charity. Your help is very important to me: I maybe be able to realize my dream and help other people at the same time. The business is related to people and I want to focus on this value the very beginning.</p>
<p>Well, I'm an optimistic guy. If I'm not able to gain the whole finding goal, I'll try to apply for a bank loan for the rest of the sum I need.</p>

Invisible to many, is also the potential low filtration performance.   That’s why for the past half a year,  we have intensified our research and development to deliver to you. Our ideal reusable super mask, a face mask that checks all of the boxes on Safety, Security and Comfort.  Essential Features Summarized  Comparison across different types of masks:  One piece of CORI Super Recharge 96 can be re-used up to 60 times, which displaces 60 pieces of disposables. In a single year, one would expect to use at most 6 pieces of CORI Super Recharge 96, which would reduce the amount of used disposable masks significantly (ranging from 720 to 1000 pieces per annum)     Being ultra light and compact, the CORI Super Recharge 96 can be kept in different discrete locations for better preparedness, especially when there are mask shortages on the market.    The Super Recharge 96 is a reusable mask capable of filtering out more than 96% of 0.3 micron sized particles, which has been independently tested at an accredited lab. (N95 Masks generally filter out >95% of 0.3um). This filtration performance can be retained up to 60 washes without deterioration, just requiring a simple rubbing procedure to the mask to recharge its filtration layers.After each cycle of washing and drying, rub the CORI Super Recharge 96 between your palm 5-10 times as shown to restore its filtration efficiency.   Be Amazed by its...    The most important aspect of the CORI Super Recharge 96 that we had engineered for, is its superb breathability with its excellent filtration properties. In comparison to a diverse range of disposable or reusable masks tested, the CORI Super Recharge 96 presents the lowest breathing resistance. This is achieved by careful selection of the filtration layers that combine both mechanical and electrostatic filtration properties. The Science of Tribo-Electric Filtration with Superior Breathability   In order to achieve the best breathability with ultra high filtration performance, a sequential filtration array was designed with the use of specially selected materials. The outermost layer, a biocompatible reticulated polyurethane foam serves as a Particle De-accelerator, slowing down particles with its microcellular channels that resemble a maze of pathways, achieving macro-filtration of larger particles between PM2.5 to PM10.    Smaller particles that are not trapped by the foam, are slowed, and are trapped by either the hydrophobic non-woven mechanical/electrostatic filter (PM2.5 to PM0.3), and the innermost tribo-electric electrostatic filter (PM0.3) with a combined efficiency of over 96%.  The two filter layers can be rubbed against each other to recharge the electrostatic filtration properties of the layers back to a very high performance, which is why we decided to call this product the SUPER RECHARGE 96.   Behold its..  Using premium materials available, from the ultra soft biocompatible microcellular polyurethane foam, to the skin friendly and adjustable soft silicone rubber straps, coupled with the unique designed C3Ratio™, the CORI Super Recharge 96 is engineered for maximal comfort, suitable for everyday usage and activities.  To achieve odour control and cleanliness, we utilised the latest gold/silver technologies from FUZE Biotech. FUZE is a permanent, chemical-free technology that can be applied to any surface or textile to prevent and protect against odour.  Listen to its..\  Speech clarity is one of the most important things in communication especially when we have to be masked up. Miscommunication leads to many undesirable outcomes, wrongly communicated messages, hurt feelings, broken down collaborations etc. Fret not, when the Super Recharge 96 allows you to speak with superb clarity with minimal muffling.    With adjustable straps and buckles on the Super Recharge 96, there is little to worry about nose to ear distances measurements at all. In order to have the best fit and comfort with our mask, our mask is designed to form a comfortable cup that fits over your nose and mouth for most common face sizes with a nose to chin measurement between 8.5cm (min) to 13cm (max).

Continuing our line of beautiful Swiss-made hand-crafted timepieces, NOVE is launching our first automatic wristwatch, the new TRIDENT R150, right here on Indiegogo. 

 

 

 



 

 



 




The TRIDENT AUTOMATIC will launch as a timed exclusive for Indiegogo, with worldwide shipping for backers by April 2021.
200m of Water Resistance 
The new TRIDENT AUTOMATIC features a beautifully sleek redesign of our already popular Trident line of watches, built in an ultra-slim 13.05mm case with up to 200m of water resistance.


 



Trident Components:


Ingeniously designed and masterfully engineered to ensure comfort on your wrist and performance in the water, the new TRIDENT AUTOMATIC is the automatic watch NOVE fans have been waiting for. 
The NOVE Movement
Made with a Swiss-made Automatic R150 movement, we carefully designed every piece of the TRIDENT AUTOMATIC to fit perfectly into our slim Trident case, without increasing its size.

The updated dial and case is now set with Double Curved Sapphire, creating high visibility and durability that is equivalent to its stunning look. We’ve also updated the dial itself, using the highest grade of Tahitian Mother of Pearl, which can take up to two years to mature and obtain from an oyster shell. This beautifully reflective material was carefully manufactured and quality controlled to best suit our standards of luxury, durability, and functionality. 

Thanks to NOVE’s experienced team of engineers and the craftsmanship Swiss-design is known for, we are proud to say that the NOVE TRIDENT AUTOMATIC uses only the finest luxury materials. This new innovative design along with the high quality construction NOVE is known for lends itself to a truly one-of-a-kind automatic wristwatch.


The TRIDENT AUTOMATIC watch maintains all the great features our Trident line of watches are known for, while updating the design to improve look, quality, and function.
Water Resilient, Dive Ready

Inspired by Poseidon, the King of the Sea, and his divine trident attribute, the TRIDENT AUTOMATIC watch was built with strong water resistance in mind. Crafted specifically for diving, this new piece by NOVE is a powerful marriage of design and engineering, resilient to heavy underwater pressures thanks to its water-resistant ability for up to 200 meters. 

Its ultra-slim construction feels light and comfortable both in and out of water, while maintaining the luxurious look of finely made Swiss-based timepieces.
Dimensions

Super Luminous Materials for Adaptive Visibility
Featuring Super Luminous technology on the watch index and hands, the TRIDENT AUTOMATIC produces a vibrant glow for easy visibility in the dark. Perfect for deep sea diving, the luminescent coating supports easy time-telling, anytime and anywhere.


Also new to our Trident series of watches, the TRIDENT AUTOMATIC features a new sweep second hand for divers and users who require time precision down to the second.






Ultra-Slim Design - Comfortable to Wear, No Shortcuts on Performance
The world’s slimmest luxury diving watch, the TRIDENT AUTOMATIC is built to be just as comfortable as it is durable and functional. The uniquely milled and thin Double Curved Sapphire crystal on the dial maximizes available space, leaving proper room for the watch hands and movement rotor to function while still allowing the Trident to retain its ultra-thin design.

NOVE engineers pushed the boundaries of design to achieve precision in the smallest space, showing the might of Poseidon in this reinvention of the Swiss-made dive watch.

<p>Sipping cocktails by the side of the pool or lounging out reading your favourite book on the beach may seem like a distant memory right now, but with vaccine progress and lockdowns easing, it’s time to start thinking about ditching those sweatpants for swim shorts.</p>
<p>If you’re the kind of guy that has worn the same beaten swim shorts for years, baggy and ill-fitting, or worse, still wear the swim shorts you panic bought after forgetting to pack your own on holiday (don’t worry, we’ve been there…), read on my friend, as Borraco has got you covered this summer.</p>
<p><strong>Borraco swimwear</strong> has been created to meet the needs of today's gentlemen beachgoers, expertly tailored, with unique designs, quick-dry technology, and a zip-back pocket – Borraco swimwear has been designed so that they can effortlessly take you from the beach to the bar. </p>

<p>In the 16th Century, Emperor Charles V of Italy ordered the construction of a system of watchtowers that ran the length of the Puglia coastline, built to protect Italy from invasion. These magnificent towers still stand today, but the sea and beaches they overlook face a different challenge and one of the world’s greatest environmental catastrophes – plastic pollution. </p>

<p>It was under one such tower, named ‘<strong>Borraco</strong>’, where the founders, volunteering to clean the beach from plastic waste, decided they wanted to build a sustainable and eco-friendly swimwear brand that could in some way contribute to reducing the plastic that blights our planet.  Being an Italian brand, we take quality and creative design seriously, and it’s these two values that underline our brand value – ‘<strong>Italian style inspires us, Sustainability defines us’</strong>. </p>
<p>Our men's swim shorts are manufactured using fabric made from <strong>100% recycled post-consumer plastic bottles</strong>. It’s our mission to always provide our customers with unique, modern and luxurious clothing in the most eco-friendly and sustainable way possible.</p>

If you’re the kind of guy that has worn the same beaten swim shorts for years, baggy and ill-fitting, or worse, still wear the swim shorts you panic bought after forgetting to pack your own on holiday (don’t worry, we’ve been there…), read on my friend, as Borraco has got you covered this summer.
Borraco swimwear has been created to meet the needs of today's gentlemen beachgoers, expertly tailored, with unique designs, quick-dry technology, and a zip-back pocket – Borraco swimwear has been designed so that they can effortlessly take you from the beach to the bar. 






In the 16th Century, Emperor Charles V of Italy ordered the construction of a system of watchtowers that ran the length of the Puglia coastline, built to protect Italy from invasion. These magnificent towers still stand today, but the sea and beaches they overlook face a different challenge and one of the world’s greatest environmental catastrophes – plastic pollution. 

It was under one such tower, named ‘Borraco’, where the founders, volunteering to clean the beach from plastic waste, decided they wanted to build a sustainable and eco-friendly swimwear brand that could in some way contribute to reducing the plastic that blights our planet.  Being an Italian brand, we take quality and creative design seriously, and it’s these two values that underline our brand value – ‘Italian style inspires us, Sustainability defines us’. 
Our men's swim shorts are manufactured using fabric made from 100% recycled post-consumer plastic bottles. It’s our mission to always provide our customers with unique, modern and luxurious clothing in the most eco-friendly and sustainable way possible.


Expertly tailored with unique hand-drawn designs 

Each pair of Borraco swims shorts are made of the equivalent of 6 recycled plastic bottles

Modern & Comfortable Fit 

Soft but durable fabric

Quick-dry technology 

Back-zip pocket to keep your valuables 

Almost invisible angled side pockets

UV resistant fabric 

Matching drawstrings with brushed metal tips

Each design has been hand-drawn by a local Italian artist (Sofia Franciosini); at Borraco we don’t believe in copy-paste designs, with every short created unique to the brand.  Choosing your designIn honour of our brand heritage, we are launching on Indiegogo with our Puglia-inspired collection, taking the best and most unique aspects of Puglia and reinventing these into our stylish and one-of-a-kind designs. When you select your perk, you will be able to choose from the designs below:  Choosing your size For reference, all the models used in our marketing material wear a size Medium. Borraco swimwear is tailored to have a modern cut and fit, however, if you prefer a bit more give in your swim shorts we suggest ordering a size up; if in doubt please use the size chart as a guide to finding your size.

Because we believe you shouldn't have to compromise on style, to adventure outdoors. And we operate in a way that we’d be proud to tell our grans about, which is the only way it should be.Fashion is the second most polluting industry in the world, second only to oil.The unsustainable use of non renewable resources and poor practices within supply chains have long lasting negative impacts on the makers and the environment. Factory employees commonly work in dangerous conditions that have lifelong health impacts.Petrochemicals and toxic dyes are used to create synthetic fabrics that aren’t biodegradable, and untreated wastewater is flushed into rivers and waterways. The amount of energy and resources used to create apparel is almost inconceivable.On top of this, people seem to think it’s acceptable to treat apparel like it’s disposable. In Australia we throw ½ a million tonnes of clothing into landfill every single year. It’s kind of crazy that something this bad is happening under our noses. This has to change.Everyone holds purchasing power, and this holds more weight than you can imagine.If you demand higher quality goods that are manufactured responsibly and aren’t devastating the environment, businesses will listen and change.Stop buying cheap, mass-produced fast fashion and start supporting businesses doing good. Ask where your clothes came from, what they're made of and under what conditions they were manufactured in. You're entitled to this information and this needs to become more transparent within the industry. Team Timbuktu creates responsibly manufactured high quality outdoors apparel from recycled materials. We know that you shouldn't have to compromise on quality, aesthetic, people or planet in order to create an epic product. We're super stringent about who we work with, what materials we use and have spent months ensuring our supply chain is top notch.Our incredibly innovative fabric supplier creates fabrics made from recycled plastics. This fabric is called RPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate) and is a more sustainable option, as it diverts plastics from landfill and uses 50% less energy to make than virgin polyester.But it doesn't feel tough or scratchy like you'd imagine plastic would feel, it's super smooth, stretchy and comfortable. Want to know how on earth we can make fabric from plastic bottles?Team Timbuktu partners with manufacturers committed to BSCI to protect our talented workers rights ensuring their health, safety and happiness. We will never cut corners in manufacturing as everyone has the right to be kept safe and healthy at work.The Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) helps companies to improve social compliance and supply chains, and protects workers’ rights. This includes no forced labour, no child labour, fair remuneration and OH&S.Learn more: http://www.bsci-intl.org Team Timbuktu is initially donating 20% of profits to help people and planet, because we'd be nothing without them and strongly believe in giving back to those who need it. We're a purpose led business that wants to be a champion for change and believe that all businesses have the capacity to make a differenceFirst up we’re supporting mental health through Waves of Wellness, a charity who are committed to changing lives and helping those with mental health challenges through surf therapy and education. They're an epic organisation who are helping reduce the stigma associated with mental health and are achieving incredible things. Learn more about their story and impact here. We’re also supporting the conservation of our environment through the Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife (FNPW). We thought it was only fair to help protect the environment we fell in love with and are so dependent on. FNPW are an amazing organisation who invest in conservation projects to protect Australia’s fragile ecosystems and native species. Find out more about their mission and projects here. Please note we will be donating 20% of profits from our launch next year, excluding funds raised from this crowdfunding campaign, due to the rules of the platform.Nope. We can see why you might think that, but Team Timbuktu is about all things outdoors.We’re starting small with our first production run but we'll be developing the range progressively as we can afford to do so to extensively cover more outdoor activities and all of the weather that gets thrown at us. Our vision is to one day make everything from hiking pants to puffer jackets, tents and sleeping bags so this is our first step on the way there. Check out all the tech features we’ve included in our first run of apparel and why we’re so much more than just another f*cking legging brand.This will sound crazy, but the majority of fashion 'raincoats' aren’t actually waterproof… they’re only water resistant. Our fabric is laminated, breathable and most importantly, waterproof. The fabric is rated 10K waterproof and 10K breathable. Essentially you can do all the outdoorsy activities in the pouring rain without getting sweaty or wet.An amazing bunch of people (aka you) pledge support in order to make a new idea happen. For Team Timbuktu, it’s super early presales to fund our first production run.By supporting Team Timbuktu at this early stage you’ll be the first to receive our product, receive discounts off RRP, help choose what prints go into production and you’ll have earned legend status for life.But....the only problem is that crowdfunding is an all or nothing concept.

<h3>What we have achieved so far...</h3>
<p>We have come a long way since we sold our first bag online 3 years ago!</p>
<p>So far we have:</p>
<p>1) Set up our first permanent shop in Melbourne, Australia. We just celebrated our 6 month Anniversary of shop success and community building locally and globally. </p>
<p>2) Through our dedication to minimising harm to our beautiful planet, we have managed to up-cycle 10 tonnes of fashion and textile waste before they hit landfill. All our products are made from clothing and textile waste, that have either been donated or discarded. This results in some of the most unique, often one-of-a-kind products, that are also durable, affordable, and beautifully and specially different. Like our supporters and customers.</p>
<p>3) Through our partnership with the charity BabyTree Projects we have funded their Solar Project program and 3,000 places for children to study English in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFMuYtMgBPw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sophia Saly School</a>.</p>
<p>4) We have built <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/beekeepersimaginarium/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BeeKeeper's Imaginarium</a>. Which is what we call our production house in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. It is where we create all our beautiful products. We began with one woman, one sewing machine, one room and now we have grown to 13 people, paid higher than the living wage and under ethical conditions. </p>
<p>5) But my greatest achievement to date, is learning to accept the loss of my sister, Sophia Saly. Who lives on in my heart. It is incredible that I need to look no further than my own skin to find all the inspiration I need to help change the world for the better. One promise kept. </p>

<h3>But the story is not over yet, we need to do more...and we need your help...</h3>

<ul>
<li>To fully complete our Imaginarium by improving our facilities, <u>investing in industrial machines</u> and more sewing machines, <u>create 5 more jobs</u> and <u>add a clothing team</u>. </li>
<li>To properly <u>set-up our Permanent Shop in Brunswick Street</u>.

<li>To <u>continue to reduce fashion waste</u> and <u>support children's access to quality education</u> in rural Cambodia. </li>
<li><p>And last but not least, to <u>""To Release the Lights""</u> a special project, that through movement and touch will ignite a light show that will illuminate the shop in hues of purple and orange. My sister's colours and a secret nod to her and to celebrate her contribution to the world.</p></li>

<h3>What our amazing customers and supporters have been saying about:</h3>
<p>""I saw a backpack on your FB page which I loved - an exchange of messages and emails and now the backpack is mine. Thank you for your attention to detail and quality service and product! Love it more in the flesh!!!"" - Hillary Makepeace</p>
<p>""Finally made my way to Beekeeper Parade today (after a long time drooling over my computer at all of the wonderful products). I was blessed to meet Koky in the store and had a lovely chat with him whilst choosing may goodies. A weekender, laptop cover, purse, coin purse and phone/passport much later, I have to say, not only are all of these products a delight to the eye, they are practical and so well made, add to that the fact they are ethically made, upcylced fabric and supporting a wonderful cause, what is there not to love about this business and Koky???"" - Anita Anderson </p>
<p>Our first Crowdfunding video created three years ago!</p>

<p>""Koky is a true inspiration and has become a friend and mentor to my young son who met him when Koky spoke at his school. His product is not only well made, useful and stylish. It is made sustainably and assists people in the best ways, from the industry that it creates, to the educational funding it provides. Despite many challenges and tragedies, Koky continually gives back in many ways."" - Anne-Maree Palmieri</p>
<p>""I got my pouch in the mail today after a wonderful shopping process in which I was fully informed at every step. <br/>It is a thing of beauty, well made and big enough to fit all the flotsam and jetsam of my handbag in one handy to reach spot.<br/>The handwritten thank you note from Koky just topped off an experience I plan on repeating any time I need a new bag of any sort.<br/>Thanks guys, so pleased to have such a lovely way of doing some good for others."" - Cherie Guest</p>
<p>""A must to check out. Awesome products with a great story behind it."" - Emily Robinson</p>
<p>""What an amazing individual Koky is! I met him and heard his story yesterday and walked out with two gorgeous bags. The bags are well constructed with thoughtful pockets but the real plus is the upcycling and the giving back to Cambodian society. Absolute kudos to Koky, what a wonderful tribute to his sister’s memory. X""  Leeanne Foster</p>
<p>""I honestly can’t recommend highly enough! I did the workshop and had a great time, and my backpack is fabulous. I also made a purse for my Mum for Christmas which is just gorgeous. Pretty sure I will be doing another workshop ... I need a new purse, and have my eye on an overnight bag ..."" - Mandy Gray</p>
<p>""I love amazing new backpack!! It's super strong and sturdy and so well made. I was so impressed it arrived (super quick!) in upcycled reusable packaging too! Well done Koky. You are really doing everything you can to build an ethical, social and environmentally friendly business. So happy to support it. Thank you!"" - Zoe Cunliffe-Jones</p>
<p>""Absolutely love everything about my new bag, my tablet pouch and my pencil case! The quality is above and beyond, so the attention to detail. What an awesome thing, to be able to get something beautiful and do something beautiful at the same time! Bliss"" - Izzy Evans</p>

</div></div>","What we have achieved so far...
We have come a long way since we sold our first bag online 3 years ago!
So far we have:
1) Set up our first permanent shop in Melbourne, Australia. We just celebrated our 6 month Anniversary of shop success and community building locally and globally. 
2) Through our dedication to minimising harm to our beautiful planet, we have managed to up-cycle 10 tonnes of fashion and textile waste before they hit landfill. All our products are made from clothing and textile waste, that have either been donated or discarded. This results in some of the most unique, often one-of-a-kind products, that are also durable, affordable, and beautifully and specially different. Like our supporters and customers.
3) Through our partnership with the charity BabyTree Projects we have funded their Solar Project program and 3,000 places for children to study English in the Sophia Saly School.
4) We have built BeeKeeper's Imaginarium. Which is what we call our production house in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. It is where we create all our beautiful products. We began with one woman, one sewing machine, one room and now we have grown to 13 people, paid higher than the living wage and under ethical conditions. 
5) But my greatest achievement to date, is learning to accept the loss of my sister, Sophia Saly. Who lives on in my heart. It is incredible that I need to look no further than my own skin to find all the inspiration I need to help change the world for the better. One promise kept. 

But the story is not over yet, we need to do more...and we need your help...


To fully complete our Imaginarium by improving our facilities, investing in industrial machines and more sewing machines, create 5 more jobs and add a clothing team. 
To properly set-up our Permanent Shop in Brunswick Street. We hope to add some special fit-outs and create an audio tour for people, that will make the BeeKeeper Shop experience even more special :) Also, create a very planty and jungly co-working space upstairs to help other dreamers, chase their dreams.
To continue to reduce fashion waste and support children's access to quality education in rural Cambodia. 
And last but not least, to ""To Release the Lights"" a special project, that through movement and touch will ignite a light show that will illuminate the shop in hues of purple and orange. My sister's colours and a secret nod to her and to celebrate her contribution to the world.

I happen to live in a very unusual neck of the woods where this fascination is nothing odd. Tucked away in a corner of the Mojave desert in California lies a little village where space travel is the talk of the town...every day of the week. It is where Richard Branson is developing his space program today.</p>

<p> <b>Exploring Materials</b>  </p>
<p>It is here where I started to explore the possibility of creating a small knife, applying the very materials used in spacecrafts. I know, it sounds like a little boy's fantasy, but why not.

From two engineers that worked on the space shuttle program, I learned about the amazing engineering and fatal mistakes which are an inevitable consequence of being at the cutting edge.  </p>

<p>Once I settled on the materials I wanted to use, I had to educate myself on the limitations of the different manufacturing processes. What types of shapes can be made and which should be avoided. But I never lost sight of the ergonomics of the knife. Clay models and 3d printed prototypes helped me determine which shape allowed for an excellent grip and perfect position when pulled from the sheath when worn around the neck.</p>

<p><b>The Blade</b>  </p>
<p>By selecting  zirconium dioxide ceramic (Zirconia) as the blade material, this knife has an edge hardness approaching that of diamond. You will never have to sharpen this knife. In addition, a 25% weight reduction was achieved, over using a traditional steel. </p>

<p> </p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>At the same time the Musvalk blade is thicker than any ceramic blade that I have come across. This extra girth is to negate the reduced impact resistance associated with this blade material. Please be assured that with normal use and handling, you should have a lifetime of cutting use from the knife.  </p>

<p> </p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>As you can see, the blade comes in a few different colors. The blades are made by compressing the white Zirconia powder into a mold, applying enormous force, which consolidates the particles into the blade shape. It is then fired in a special kiln for days. When a blade is fired longer and under higher pressure, it turns from white to black and becomes slightly denser. However, I have been told that the difference in properties is negligible in the application as a knife.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The ""golden"" blade gets its color from an applied titanium nitride coating. This film is deposited as a vapor and is extremely wear resistant. It is often found on machine tools. Since the ceramic of the blade itself is already very wear resistant, the non coated blades are as sharp and wear resistant.  </p>
<p><b>Sheath and Scales</b>  </p>
<p>Carbon fiber is the material of choice for the hulls of spacecrafts of the past and present. The laminated fibers provide a superior stiffness and result in unbelievably light structures. I have applied a 2 mm twill weave carbon fiber to provide essential grip without adding unnecessary weight. As an additional option I am also considering a metal and fiberglass laminate, sometimes referred to as barracuda glass. </p>
<div data-id=""17417443""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1504650172/wpsqurn2xzifrit5s76c.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Even the sheath is largely made of carbon fiber, complimented with a material called Zytel. This glass reinforced nylon provides the spring power to hold the knife in place, and is very wear resistant. Custom made Torx head titanium bolts are used to securely fasten the separate parts of the design together. </p>

<p>After many prototypes (as can be seen in the video), I am glad to say that all the knives that you see in the pictures here are pre-production models, meaning that they are as good as ready for production. I will be assembling the knifes with my own hands, but since the separate parts of this knife each require a highly specialized production process, they will be made elsewhere under my supervision.

</div></div>","Blue and Matte Black blade colors MusvalkFierce, yet small and elegant. The smallest bird of prey in the order of falcons is called the Musvalk, in my native Dutch language. This creature perfectly embodies the knife I just created, which is why I chose its name to represent this knife and hopefully more knife designs in the future.
Musvalk unsheathed
 
Mojave
  As a designer I am always curious about exotic materials and how to use them effectively in my work. I happen to live in a very unusual neck of the woods where this fascination is nothing odd. Tucked away in a corner of the Mojave desert in California lies a little village where space travel is the talk of the town...every day of the week. It is where Richard Branson is developing his space program today.
For him...
 
It is where you can see test pilots and engineers have lunch at the local cafe, and it has a rich history of being at the cutting edge of space- and aircraft development.  

 

 
 Exploring Materials  
It is here where I started to explore the possibility of creating a small knife, applying the very materials used in spacecrafts. I know, it sounds like a little boy's fantasy, but why not. By talking to whomever was not bound by confidentiality in this town, I got to see and feel these materials in person. From two engineers that worked on the space shuttle program, I learned about the amazing engineering and fatal mistakes which are an inevitable consequence of being at the cutting edge.  
Materials used
 
To make the translation from spacecraft to knife, I had to select materials that would have a place in my work. The properties that I was looking for were: light weight, hard edge and pleasing to the eye. Sometimes I had to chose a derivative material, to better suit my purpose. 
...and her.
 
 Stealth Design  
Initial inspiration of the angular shape of the knife was the geometry of the Lockheed F117 Nighthawk stealth fighter jet, which was tested in this region too. Although its iconic design is purely functional, it is also a visual representation of stealth.

<p>Ose(Uh-Seh) “Vintage Wear With an Emphasis on Curve” was created by Ose Ogbemudia who gained experience working in the fashion industries for a variety of retailers which lead her to step out on her ow to create Ose(Uh-Seh). As a Plus-Size Women, Ose was frustrated with not finding unique and head-turning clothing for all occasions without spending a ridiculous amount of money. She started getting into vintage shopping with the economy getting tight and the going green movement becoming a priority and would see the response she would get from friends and family about the looks she created for herself and others. Ose wanted to provide her curvy divas with the same quality, affordable one-of-a-kind vintage that most curvy girls find it hard to find or put together.</p>
<p>Now that Ose(Uh-Seh) has been in business for a little over a year, we have been able to see the great response to vintage wear for our target market who are women size 12+ who love one-of-a-kind pieces and enjoy looks styled and reconstructed to make them stand out from the rest. We enjoy seeing the excitement and boost of confidence our clients receive when we provide them with looks they love and we're ready to do the same for our friends overseas starting in London with the first London Plus-Size Fashion Weekend.</p>
<p>Your support to help Ose(Uh-Seh) grow our business by going to London is not only going to provide our Curvy Divas in the UK with great clothing options, its so much bigger than that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ose(Uh-Seh) can providing paid jobs to those who are seasoned models as well as allowing women who dream of breaking into Plus-Modeling world with opportunities to shoot with our company more frequently.</li>
<li>Ose(Uh-Seh) can the Small Business Community on a larger scale by providing more jobs as we grow to photographers, make-up artist, and the many others small business we support as they do great work for us.</li>
<li>Ose(Uh-Seh) can also give back to our community on a larger scale by starting programs to teach the youth and upcoming designs what the business of fashion is about, and the reality of being a small business owner.</li>
</ul><p>If you believe in supporting any of these things, then supporting Ose(Uh-Seh) is something you should do.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are looking to raise $15,000 to help cover the expensive of participating in London Plus Fashion Weekend and cover our expenses to travel and lodging for the trip. We also want to market our product to other Plus-Size Boutiques while we are out in London, so your donation will help us go forward with this initiative.</p>

Ose(Uh-Seh) “Vintage Wear With an Emphasis on Curve” was created by Ose Ogbemudia who gained experience working in the fashion industries for a variety of retailers which lead her to step out on her ow to create Ose(Uh-Seh). As a Plus-Size Women, Ose was frustrated with not finding unique and head-turning clothing for all occasions without spending a ridiculous amount of money. She started getting into vintage shopping with the economy getting tight and the going green movement becoming a priority and would see the response she would get from friends and family about the looks she created for herself and others. Ose wanted to provide her curvy divas with the same quality, affordable one-of-a-kind vintage that most curvy girls find it hard to find or put together.
Now that Ose(Uh-Seh) has been in business for a little over a year, we have been able to see the great response to vintage wear for our target market who are women size 12+ who love one-of-a-kind pieces and enjoy looks styled and reconstructed to make them stand out from the rest. We enjoy seeing the excitement and boost of confidence our clients receive when we provide them with looks they love and we're ready to do the same for our friends overseas starting in London with the first London Plus-Size Fashion Weekend.
Your support to help Ose(Uh-Seh) grow our business by going to London is not only going to provide our Curvy Divas in the UK with great clothing options, its so much bigger than that:

Ose(Uh-Seh) can providing paid jobs to those who are seasoned models as well as allowing women who dream of breaking into Plus-Modeling world with opportunities to shoot with our company more frequently.
Ose(Uh-Seh) can the Small Business Community on a larger scale by providing more jobs as we grow to photographers, make-up artist, and the many others small business we support as they do great work for us.
Ose(Uh-Seh) can also give back to our community on a larger scale by starting programs to teach the youth and upcoming designs what the business of fashion is about, and the reality of being a small business owner.
If you believe in supporting any of these things, then supporting Ose(Uh-Seh) is something you should do.

<h3>Pura Vida Vintage - ""This is the Pure Life""</h3>
<p>There are times when the universe calls you back to what is truly important.  Krystle Ramos experienced one of those times after being laid off from corporate America in 2012.  The decision forced her to reevaluate what was important in life.  Krystle is an artist but even after becoming an award-winning singer and songwriter, Krystle decided to put her young family first and forego her music career for financial stability.  In the 8 years that followed, Krystle learned how businesses ran, how products are developed and sold, what to do right and what to do wrong.  All of that culminated into jumping off the corporate treadmill and jumping out on her own.  </p>
<p>Her love of vintage started very young; from raiding her mother's closet to begging her dad for a '66 Mustang in high school, she knew old was new and vintage was cool.  Krystle opened Pura Vida Vintage in October 2012, starting online and putting the plan in motion for a brick and mortar store in 2013.  In late 2012, after searching and praying, Krystle found her storefront on Nashville's famous Music Row.  Vintage stores dotted East Nashville's hip hoods and 12South's cool vibe but who was helping the under served folks on the Row?  The college students at Belmont and Vandy?  Surely someone would step up and make it happen!  </p>
<p>Her mission is to bring the beautiful and forever trendy world of vintage fashion to all those who would appreciate it.  Help Krystle contribute to the vitality of Nashville's growing fashion community as well as helping others develop unique style and be fashionably green.  Oh, and help her accomplish her dream of freedom for her and her family.  Her brick and mortar store is set to open on March 1st, 2013 and so far, she has been fully self-funded, with as much help as possible from her incredibly supportive family members.  It's been difficult to say the least, but a path that she doesn't regret.    </p>

<h2>In my shoes: </h2>
<p>For as long as I can remember I have always had a love for footwear design.  From the concept to a sketch on paper, to the handwork and stitching that make the shoe come alive, and on to the finished product in action on our busy city streets. The creation of a great shoe is more than footwear; it's a work of art. As a footwear designer for the past 5 years, I've been able to design footwear for various brands, including Roberto Cavalli.  Learning the skill of handmade footwear in Firenze Italy has allowed me to fine-tune the craft of creating high quality, original footwear.  I have traveled back and forth from NY to Asia designing for multiple shoe factories. This has helped me to better understand the footwear i design, and allowed me to bring my dream to all of you!</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT IS MICHAEL GREY FOOTWEAR? </strong></h2>
<p><strong>MICHAEL GREY FOOTWEAR </strong>is casual dress, where comfort is the key. I wanted to create a line that you could wear to the office, but is also perfect for an evening out. The men’s line is composed of gorgeous hand selected leathers, unique patterns, and hidden details all composed on a comfortable crepe outsole, while the ladies line has your day covered from conference room to cocktail dinner. Beautiful supple leathers, sleek silhouettes, and subtle details are its heart and soul. I feel this line is where old world handmade shoes, vintage craft, and fashion footwear design converge. With your support I hope to be able to share a piece of my dream with the world! <strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>HANDS BEHIND THE WORK:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Michael Mack, and I am a 27-year-old footwear designer. I graduated from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2007 with a bachelor in Industrial design. After working in NYC as a shoe designer for two years, I found myself wanting to know more about the product I designed everyday. I developed a passion for the craft of hand made footwear. I soon found myself on a flight destined for Firenze Italy. There I attended POLIMODA to complete my yearlong masters degree in traditional handmade fashion footwear design. I gained knowledge in leathers, crafting, techniques, and European design concepts.  Finishing the year interning in Roberto Cavalli for 2 and a half months, I gained invaluable incite into the world of luxury footwear and products. Back in NY I began setting up my own private workshop in Brooklyn making handmade shoes, and designing what would become the MICHAEL GREY FOOTWEAR line.</p>

Meet the Designers:
Brent Aguilar is a fifth year dual degree student in Illustration and
Marketing at RIT. Brent started his path in fashion by incorporating his
artistic design skills into fiber art forms. Through teaching himself garment
construction and collaborating with other great artists, photographers, and
designers, Brent has been able to work in a visual storytelling capacity. A
solid understanding in design, illustration, photography and retouching Brent
has been able to push fashion's innovation potential to new forms and concepts.
Brent creates works for Fashion, Illustration, Advertising and Marketing needs
through his own business; Brent Aguilar Media House (BAMH)
BAMH is a full production establishment working from conceptualization,
execution, to post production. Brent's line will vary from time to time;

Raymond Ramirez 
is fourth
year Business Management student at RIT. With a strong passion for fashion, he
started designing when he was twelve years old. Young Raymond was dedicated and
self-taught. At a young age he spent his days learning to sketch and sew while
analyzing fashion trends. One of his goals in life is to be able to make
breathtaking pieces for his clients. Raymond looked up to Christian Dior, Oscar
de la Renta, and Alexander McQueen as they all inspire him to continue pursuing
his dream. He was inspired by the 1950's silhouette and elegant designs, especially Dior's. Still today, he continues to
gain knowledge of fashion and apply them to his clothing line, House of
Grey. 
House of Grey is a clothing line launched in 2012. The line includes apparel and accessories designed with a luxurious minimalist aesthetic while
being classic and modern.

Hi,
I am Monika Kusinska, and I have been designing shoes for women for the
past decade.
HELPING women find their size of well-made and fitting shoes is a great cause to which I devote my passion and talents. PRESERVING Traditional Crafts is my second major priority for the M.O. of Autograf New York.

My journey started at age seven with
a simple dream: ""I want to be a fashion designer!"" I graduated from Middlesex University in 1998, where I was first in my
class, winning Bhs Graduate Fashion Week of 1998 -- Best Women's Collection.

 My “Dream Come True Moment,” at twenty-six, was one I could not share with my father, Stefan Kusinski, who passed away six weeks before my graduation.  




This painful event sealed my devotion to my
profession. He taught me to never give up on my dreams!


Size Matters . . . was born out of my personal empathy for pains caused
by ill-fitting shoes. I wore shoes sized too small growing up and ended up
having surgery at twenty-three. Painful surgery, and long months of physical
therapy, left me scarred, mentally and physically, by literally, my passion for
fashion. 



I am size 12, and it has been challenging since my surgery to find
comfortable, well-made shoes. Acutely sensitive to uncomfortable shoes, I have
been trading my shoe sketches with APIA for shoes in my size. Fortunate to wear
Italian Handcrafted quality, I was forced to compromise at work -- designing
shoes on budget for large companies who cared mostly about profit margins while
often compromising fit.

When I was searching for inspiration to launch my own business, I ""discovered""

<p><strong><em>The awards and acknowledgements have been great but as a creative what inspires and encourages my passion is the constant need to find new and innovative ways to combine my love of Art, Technology and Fashion.</em></strong>  </p>
<p>Ive barely scratched the surface and constantly finding enjoyment in the journey of discovery and how best to apply this to my work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Im constantly amazed at what technology provides in creating new innovative techniques, ideas, methodology in fibres that allow us to manipulate, enhance, construct, build and mould fabrics into shapes that allow people such as myself to be constantly inspired.</p>
<p>My style may be a little left field for some but this is who I am as a designer and these are the things that make me love what I do....</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT IM LOOKING FOR? </strong></p>
<p><br/>Im currently in the process of preparing my first full mini collection to be presented in February, its not as innovative as I would like it to be but Im pleased to be-able to introduce some new fabrics to the range.  </p>
<p>Some of the materials are coming from an award winning European designer not known for fashion but his materials will give the collection some structure whilst maintaining its female empowering silhouettes.</p>

<p>It does seem like quite a mountain to climb in such a short time but I do believe with your generous support it will be possible.</p>

<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p>To be completely honest I find it uncomfortably weird asking money from people I know, more so from people that I don't but when I stumbled upon Indiegogo and read what they were about I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<h3>Crows</h3>
<p>This design was originally drawn as an homage to my own backyard murder as they taught their new fledges how to mob a hawk, one fine morning in May 2017. It then proceeded to go viral, and almost immediately requests for shirts began to appear. Clearly, an idea whose time had come. Crows before bros. Support your local murder.</p>
<p>I am an artist and printmaker by profession, so I've been able to offer sew-on patches and fine art prints made by hand in small batches. The process I use is 100% analog, so my reproductions are as close to my original artwork as possible. But shirts? Beyond my reach. I don't have the time or the resources to turn into a t-shirt production company. Moreover, how could I—and why should I—hand over my crows to any old on-demand shirt company, in an industry that is up to its eyeballs in bros? Just because it was unexpectedly popular?</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>So You Like Crows, I Like Crows, Now What?</h3>
<p>The demand for Crows Before Bros shirts has grown so, so much larger than I can meet with my own two hands. But I also want to offer you a shirt that I would feel proud to have my artwork on. I've been on the hunt for small, women-owned businesses who have ethical printing options and environmentally friendly methods.</p>
<p>What does that mean? It means you get a black unisex t-shirt made in safe, fair, legal and humane working conditions, and printed with environmentally friendly water-soluble ink by the fine folks at <a href=""https://threadbare-print-house.myshopify.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Threadbare</a>. It's a super soft shirt, it's a deeply solid black, it's professional quality, and it's ready to be your favorite shirt. (Sizing chart is available in <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/crows-before-bros-t-shirts/x/2742097"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the FAQ</a>.)</p>
<p>I've also listened to the requests for other forms that Crows Before Bros might take - pinback buttons, stickers, sew-on back patches larger than what I currently make myself. Put them all together and it looks an awful lot like a crowdfunding campaign. You get a shirt with my original artwork on it in your hands before anyone else, I get to offer these shirts in my shop in the long-term, together we get a chain reaction that starts benefitting small businesses! You can help me make all of this happen.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Crow Funding</h3>
<p>I’m bringing this campaign to you for a very simple reason. I am a one-person operation who makes art, and this is a project big enough to outsource to a professional crew of printers. Once all of the initial resources needed to make shirts (and all the other perks) are all collected, it will be so much easier to offer these as standard items in my Etsy shop, to fulfill purchases, and to order reprints. I've taken in feedback on the existing Crows Before Bros design, I've done the research, and I've crunched the numbers on those costs. But those initial resources are something I do not have to get started. Every pledge, no matter how big or small, gets this project closer to reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risky Business</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Together we can make this campaign a success, but sometimes these things fall short of the mark. What happens then? Indiegogo allows me to retain partial funding if the total goal is not met. All of those resources will be devoted to securing your pledged rewards, and any remaining funds after that will go towards a more modest investment in Crows Before Bros t-shirts offered as retail.</p>
<p>Extra perks, like pins and stickers, are additions I would have made sooner or later to my business. Their associated costs are achievable for me personally if funding doesn’t come through. The shirts themselves require a minimum order of 24. My cost estimates are based on a quantity of 50 so that there's room for flexibility.</p>
<p>Two dozen shirts seems achievable on the interest expressed, and turnaround on shirt production is quite nimble compared to publishing or other manufacturing processes. Working with outsourcing a design to a crew of professional printers is not something that I do often, but thanks to the festival and convention schedules I work with, as well as over 10 years of experience in fulfilling Etsy orders for my small business, setting and meeting production goals is no problem.</p>
<p>With familiarity of the processes and an estimated delivery date with plenty of elbow room,  I am confident that I can put your new favorite shirt into your hands.</p>

We’ve designed each product to work functionally on its own, but even better together! The Ring comes part of the Strap, and the Clip system, so unfortunately the Clip or Strap won’t be made available just on its own. But what’s great about the products is you will have the option to use all / or one part of it, and customise as you like!
Products: Can I use the Orbitkey Clip for climbing?Not that we’ve tried, and we don’t recommend for you to either! Our Clip is not designed to use for rock climbing, or as a safety harness equipment. The Orbitkey Clip is suitable and great to use for your everyday carry such as your keys, tags, drink bottle.Products: Can I use any key or accessory (like car key fob) on my Orbitkey Ring? Will they fit?Sure can! As long as the hole on the key or car fob is greater than 3.6mm wide, it will fit through the Ring.Products: What are the dimensions of the Orbitkey Clip, Ring and Strap?Orbitkey Clip only - Length: 52mm, Width: 30.5mm, Thickness: 4.5mm Orbitkey Clip system - Length: 103mm, Width: 30.5mm, Thickness: 4.5mm Orbitkey Strap system - Length (tip to tip with the ring): 238mm, Length (Strap only): 207.5mm, Width of the leather: 14mm, Thickness of the leather: 1.6mm Orbitkey Ring - Diameter: 30mm, Thickness: 3.5mm, *Opening: 3.6mmProducts: Can I use the Orbitkey Ring, Clip and Strap with the Orbitkey Key Organiser.Most definitely, in fact, we encourage it! All our products work great on their own but together they create an ecosystem to help manage and organise your everyday essentials. Use the Orbitkey Ring to carry and quickly detach your car keys and other bulkier items, Use the Orbitkey Clip to hook your Orbitkey on your belt loop or bag and use the Orbitkey Strap to wrap your orbitkey around your wrist or tie it to your bag.Shipping: When will I receive my stuff?We aim to have manufacturing completed in March 2018, and send stock to our fulfilment centres (Melbourne, LA, Hong Kong, Netherlands, and UK).

<p>Tons and tons of clothing are thrown away by consumers each year, and most of them ended up in landfills, incremented, or even worse, become ocean waste. Much of the discarded clothing are very difficult to recycle because they are made from mixed materials like polyester and cotton mix. But not with the Koup cinnamon t-shirt! Our t-shirt is made not only with recycled material in mind but more importantly, to be recycled at the end of its life. </p>
<p>To fully realise our vision of the circular clothing economy, we need to close the loop in the apparel industry. We encourage you to send our t-shirt back to us when you are done with it, where we can recycle them to make new yarns for new garments. Or alternatively, you can simply take them to the local recycling facilities that accept textile waste!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581401763/oefvc9lv6u5dbzazq5hd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Anti-odour</strong></h3>
<p>We smell after sweating because bacteria break down proteins in our sweat into acids, which contains odour. One way to eliminate the smell after sweating is to reduce or inhibit the growth of odour producing bacteria on your skin. We have tested our fabric containing cinnamon extracts against Staphylococcus aureus - one of the most common odour-producing bacteria on our skin.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581401936/hdkk6fvjoafuk513f62c.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The picture on the left is when the bacteria are first introduced to the petri dish, as you can see the white dots are the actual bacteria! After 18-24 hours in contact with the cinnamon fabric, almost all the bacteria disappeared on the surface of our fabric. And since the odour-producing bacteria can't grow on the cinnamon t-shirt, we eliminate the annoying smell after sweating, keeping you fresh on the go. </p>
<p>What's even better is that we use a <strong>patented technology </strong>that combines cinnamon extracts with recycled polyester that are then made into yarns, fabrics and garments. In contrast to chemical or heavy metal coatings that are temporary and are washed off in as little as 5 washes, <strong>our anti-odour function will last the lifetime of the t-shirt! </strong></p>
<p>We tested the anti-microbial property of the t-shirt after 20 washes, and the result shows the function did not fade a bit. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581403194/uqvmzmibodxy3rt0dxop.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Moisture-wicking</h3>
<p>Moisture-wicking is usually achieved by adding chemical coatings to the fabric, whereas the Koup cinnamon t-shirt <strong>uses physics to do the work</strong>. We use a more expensive customised yarn which has a special cross-section to <strong>promote capillary action</strong>. As a result, it draws water away from the skin quicker and leaving you dry and comfortable after work-outs. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581404127/qe6gk4gix9xnpkenndb4.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Special yarn cross-section to promote moisture-wicking</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Breathable &amp; cooling</h2>
<p>The Koup cinnamon t-shirt has a textured jacquard structure (almost like many pores in the fabric), allowing air and sweat to exchange freely through the fabric. This <strong>allows body heat to pass through the fabric to the ambient environment</strong>, so you feel comfortable when wearing the t-shirt.</p>

<h3>Comfortable fit</h3>

<h3>Sustainable &amp; responsible production</h3>
<p>The Koup cinnamon t-shirt is made free of toxic chemicals (REACH &amp; OEKO-TEX compliance) and from recycled material (Global Recycled Standard approved yarn supplier). We use Bluesign certified dye mill to dye our fabrics and our garment manufacturer is Worldwide responsible accredited production (WRAP) certified. We only source our raw material from suppliers who have gone through the industry's most stringent tests on sustainability to ensure our product is truly environmentally friendly. </p>

<p>Environmental accreditations for the Koup Cinnamon T-shirt</p>
<p>To go the extra mile, <strong>we make our packaging out of otherwise wasted fabric trims</strong> and use bio-degradable postage bags, so that we minimise the footprint on the earth. To <strong>close the loop</strong>, our t-shirt is made with single material so it's fully recyclable.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Production Delays </strong></p>
<p>The materials we use are 100% customised for us. We will be working with a renowned Taiwanese yarn supplier, using their patented cinnamon yarn technology to create our permanent anti-odour yarn. We have however stepped up a gear to combine this technology with recycled polyester and special texturing of the yarn for our wicking function. This is truly a revolutionary material that no one has attempted before and there may be delays or unforeseen circumstances in the production of the yarn. For fabric and garment production, we will be working with trusted manufacturers, who supply many global brands. Regardless, there could be production delays as with any manufacturing. </p>
<p><strong>Sizing &amp; Measurements </strong></p>
<p>We will perform thorough checks of the finished pieces using industrial QC standards. However, all measurements will include an allowed 0.5 - 1.5cm depending on the measurement.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping</strong></p>
<p>We will be working with a local fulfilment centre in Taiwan, hence custom charges may apply. Each parcel will have a tracking number so it can be tracked. Unfortunate events may happen in that the parcel will get lost during its delivery but we will do everything we can to help track them down, however, we are not responsible for packages delivered outside the expected time frame.</p>
<p><strong>Other Disclaimers </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>May not be suitable for people with cinnamon allergy.</li>
<li>Do not use silicone-based detergent when washing and do not use fabric softener.</li>
<li>We suggest hand wash your Koup shirt at low temperature and no tumble dry.</li>
<li>Actual colour may look different from the screen.</li>
<li>Our anti-odour function inhibits the growth of odour-producing bacteria but does not prevent other odours from being transferred onto the shirt.</li>
</ul>

The picture on the left is when the bacteria are first introduced to the petri dish, as you can see the white dots are the actual bacteria! After 18-24 hours in contact with the cinnamon fabric, almost all the bacteria disappeared on the surface of our fabric. And since the odour-producing bacteria can't grow on the cinnamon t-shirt, we eliminate the annoying smell after sweating, keeping you fresh on the go. 
What's even better is that we use a patented technology that combines cinnamon extracts with recycled polyester that are then made into yarns, fabrics and garments. In contrast to chemical or heavy metal coatings that are temporary and are washed off in as little as 5 washes, our anti-odour function will last the lifetime of the t-shirt! 
We tested the anti-microbial property of the t-shirt after 20 washes, and the result shows the function did not fade a bit. 

 
 
Moisture-wicking
Moisture-wicking is usually achieved by adding chemical coatings to the fabric, whereas the Koup cinnamon t-shirt uses physics to do the work. We use a more expensive customised yarn which has a special cross-section to promote capillary action. As a result, it draws water away from the skin quicker and leaving you dry and comfortable after work-outs. 

Special yarn cross-section to promote moisture-wicking
 
Breathable & cooling
The Koup cinnamon t-shirt has a textured jacquard structure (almost like many pores in the fabric), allowing air and sweat to exchange freely through the fabric. This allows body heat to pass through the fabric to the ambient environment, so you feel comfortable when wearing the t-shirt.

Lightweight

 
Comfortable fit
Our novel Agile-fit™ that compliments any body type and our newly improved fabric have more stretch than the previous version. With the new knitting method, we have increased the stretchiness of our fabric by 30%.
 
Sustainable & responsible production
The Koup cinnamon t-shirt is made free of toxic chemicals (REACH & OEKO-TEX compliance) and from recycled material (Global Recycled Standard approved yarn supplier). We use Bluesign certified dye mill to dye our fabrics and our garment manufacturer is Worldwide responsible accredited production (WRAP) certified. We only source our raw material from suppliers who have gone through the industry's most stringent tests on sustainability to ensure our product is truly environmentally friendly. 

Environmental accreditations for the Koup Cinnamon T-shirt
To go the extra mile, we make our packaging out of otherwise wasted fabric trims and use bio-degradable postage bags, so that we minimise the footprint on the earth. To close the loop, our t-shirt is made with single material so it's fully recyclable.

Risks and challenges
 
Production Delays 
The materials we use are 100% customised for us. We will be working with a renowned Taiwanese yarn supplier, using their patented cinnamon yarn technology to create our permanent anti-odour yarn. We have however stepped up a gear to combine this technology with recycled polyester and special texturing of the yarn for our wicking function. This is truly a revolutionary material that no one has attempted before and there may be delays or unforeseen circumstances in the production of the yarn. For fabric and garment production, we will be working with trusted manufacturers, who supply many global brands. Regardless, there could be production delays as with any manufacturing. 
Sizing & Measurements 
We will perform thorough checks of the finished pieces using industrial QC standards. However, all measurements will include an allowed 0.5 - 1.5cm depending on the measurement.
Shipping
We will be working with a local fulfilment centre in Taiwan, hence custom charges may apply. Each parcel will have a tracking number so it can be tracked. Unfortunate events may happen in that the parcel will get lost during its delivery but we will do everything we can to help track them down, however, we are not responsible for packages delivered outside the expected time frame.
Other Disclaimers 

May not be suitable for people with cinnamon allergy.
Do not use silicone-based detergent when washing and do not use fabric softener.
We suggest hand wash your Koup shirt at low temperature and no tumble dry.
Actual colour may look different from the screen.
Our anti-odour function inhibits the growth of odour-producing bacteria but does not prevent other odours from being transferred onto the shirt.",34.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The Wayfarer Messenger bag is brimming with space, versatility, and durability. <b>It's the bag Indiana Jones would be jealous of.</b>

exploring ancient ruins. It features an incredible body contouring 
design that can be worn comfortably across the back or along the side on
 either shoulder. Crafted from thick saddle leather with hand stitched 
seams and hand pounded rivets. <b>The Wayfarer well characterizes our obsession of uncompromising quality with an almost absurd attention to detail.</b></p>

<p>The Zinnia Convertible is an instantly convertible backpack/crossbody
 bag coming in a luxurious Mahogany leather and fitting up a 13"" laptop 
as well as a ton more. <b>The unique conversion system we designed just may be the best thing ever.</b>
 It means no fumbling, no stress, just grab and pull. The classic 
styling and high quality construction means this bag will always look 
good, in fact it just gets better with age. Great for everything from 
your morning commute to a weekend away. <b>The Zinnia is the perfect companion for any on-the-go intrepid soul.</b></p>

<p>Another unique feature is the wider-at-the-bottom design. This means

<p>The padded laptop pocket is big enough for up to a 13” laptop. The 
main bucket can hold almost anything, including an SLR camera! The

 back for your phone and papers, and another front pocket with a 
magnetic closure for all your loose items. Everything in the Zinnia 
stays easily accessible as well as organized.</p>
<p>Not only is the 
Zinnia crafted with beautiful, supple, and durable mahogany leather, it 
is also lined with a rich taupe wool fabric-blend imported from England 
and accented with forged steel hardware.</p>

<p> The brilliance in this design is that you do not have remove any of 
the items from the Slate Grey canvas pockets to use them. Each has a 
pull-through plug opening that lets you both plug in and charge without 
removing anything from the Tech Roll, so everything always stays 
organized and tangle free. In addition to the cord pockets, there is a 
large covered pocket for storing a battery pack or hard drive. Just pull
 the plug through and you are ready to use it.</p>

<p>A zippered pocket is also there to put all your loose odds and ends 
in a safe place, it is even big enough to fit the entire power brick and
 charging cord for most laptops with room to spare! There is also two 
exterior specially sized mini pockets for SD Cards.  This all folds up 
elegantly and compactly into a Mahogany leather exterior that speaks for
 itself, with wrap-around straps for full secure expansion. This is 
especially great for travel because it is as simple as opening the Tech 
Roll and plugging in. No stray cords to lose, no fumbling around to find
 your small tech. When you are finished, just tuck and roll.</p>

<p>We are a designer couple living in the Bay Area of San Francisco. As 
avid world travelers, language learners, volunteers, and artists we are 
always on the hunt for the perfect bags to take with us on our 
adventures, the kind of bags that will go anywhere, from the streets of 
Berkeley to the ruins of Ephesus, from the New York Rat Race to the 
Scotland Highlands, from our favorite neighborhood tea cafe to the 
fields of Darjeeling.</p>
<p>Last year we ran a kickstarter to launch our first two bags: the 
Journeyman Commuter and the Lillium Side-purse. The response was 
fantastic and the rave reviews speak for themselves. Here's just a few:</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>As crowdfunding veterans with 2 years of business under our belt, we 
have many of the risks and challenges very well mitigated. We have also 
partnered again with Brian Holmes of Pad &amp; Quill who brings his 
extensive product development, manufacturing, and delivering experience 
into play to help ensure everything runs smoothly.</p>
<p>Of course, when having products made by hand there is always the risk
 that things might take a little longer than expected. Slight delays may
 happen since multiple suppliers are involved in sourcing materials and 
getting things set up. That is the biggest risk we face.</p>
<p>We are committed to keeping our products to the highest standards and
 have multiple levels of quality assurance checks to make sure that each
 and every bag is the highest of quality before we ship. We will not 
ship a single inferior product, that is our promise to you.</p>

</div></div>","Hello fellow adventurers! We are Stephen & Tiffani from The Intrepid Bag Co. You may remember us from last year. After a successful and exciting campaign we brought you the Journeyman Leather Messenger Bag and the Lillium Leather Side Purse, and we delivered to rave reviews (we've included a few on this page).This
 year we have partnered with Brian Holmes from Pad & Quill again and
 are excited to bring you our all new Explorer line of leather goods for
 modern day intrepid wanderers. This line up includes some incredible 
innovations such as the instantly convertible Zinnia backpack/crossbody 
bag, the spacious Wayfarer Messenger, a Slim Wallet, rugged Camera 
Strap, and the extremely useful and unique Tech Roll cord organizer. 
Take a look!


Meet the Intrepid Explorer Line!


Wayfarer Messenger





The Wayfarer Messenger bag is brimming with space, versatility, and durability. It's the bag Indiana Jones would be jealous of.
 Perfect for any situation- from a day in the urban jungle to a week 
exploring ancient ruins. It features an incredible body contouring 
design that can be worn comfortably across the back or along the side on
 either shoulder. Crafted from thick saddle leather with hand stitched 
seams and hand pounded rivets. The Wayfarer well characterizes our obsession of uncompromising quality with an almost absurd attention to detail.







This bag has space! Inside you can easily fit a 17” laptop, iPad, a 
change of clothes, and all your other tech with room to spare. The side 
pockets fit up to an iPhone 6 along with a journal and some pens for 
quick access.  The front expanding pockets are perfect for an iPad Mini,
 a Macbook charger, and even our brilliantly useful Tech Roll.




Every detail has been carefully considered, from the marine grade 
UV-resistant stitching, the hand-pounded copper rivets on the lay-flat 
handle, the contoured angles on every side, the classic herringbone 
lined interior, to the USA sourced full grain super thick and durable 
coffee saddle leather.








Featuring:

    Up to 17” laptop padded pocket
    Leather iPad pocket
    Exterior side pockets for an iPhone 6 Plus, with flap closure
    2 deep expanding front pockets
    Quick access exterior newspaper pocket
    Forged steel quick-release buckles
    Angled shoulder straps for ergonomic comfort
    Lay flat rear handle with copper rivets
    100% Made in USA vegetable tanned full grain coffee saddle leather
    UV-Resistant Marine-grade nylon stitching (used in parachute construction)
    Forged steel and copper hardware
    Hidden passport pocket









Special Bonus Gift:
We are also throwing in a special 
bonus gift of two 20"" leather lash straps with every Wayfarer Messenger.
 These straps can be used to mount additional gear to the outside of the
 bag (tripod, blanket, jacket, yoga mat, etc...) for even more 
versatility using the handy mounting points on the bottom of the bag. 
(Estimated retail price of $19.99)






Zinnia Convertible



The Zinnia Convertible is an instantly convertible backpack/crossbody
 bag coming in a luxurious Mahogany leather and fitting up a 13"" laptop 
as well as a ton more. The unique conversion system we designed just may be the best thing ever.
 It means no fumbling, no stress, just grab and pull. The classic 
styling and high quality construction means this bag will always look 
good, in fact it just gets better with age. Great for everything from 
your morning commute to a weekend away. The Zinnia is the perfect companion for any on-the-go intrepid soul.







Another unique feature is the wider-at-the-bottom design. This means 
it is stable enough to stand up on its own while still fitting a 
surprising amount of your daily essentials. The rich Mahogany leather is
 really showcased in the cascading front flap with interior rain flaps 
to keep the interior dry and safe.




The padded laptop pocket is big enough for up to a 13” laptop. The 
main bucket can hold almost anything, including an SLR camera! The 
expanding side water bottle pockets hide away when not in use, while 
adding a splash of style. There are also two quick access pockets on the
 back for your phone and papers, and another front pocket with a 
magnetic closure for all your loose items. Everything in the Zinnia 
stays easily accessible as well as organized.
Not only is the 
Zinnia crafted with beautiful, supple, and durable mahogany leather, it 
is also lined with a rich taupe wool fabric-blend imported from England 
and accented with forged steel hardware.








Featuring:

    Instant Grab-and-Pull Conversion From Backpack to Crossbody Bag 
    13” Laptop Padded Pocket
    Hide-Away Side Water Bottle Pockets
    Roomy Front Compartment
    Cascading Front Flap with Secure Tuck-Clasp
    2 Quick Access Rear Slim Pockets
    Top Handle with Elegant Petal Shape for Hand Carry
    Imported English Wool Blend Lining
    100% Made in USA Vegetable Tanned Full Grain Mahogany Saddle Leather
    UV Resistant Marine-Grade Nylon Stitching (used in parachute construction)
    Forged Steel Hardware






 Special Bonus Gift:
We are also throwing in a special 
bonus gift of two 20"" leather lash straps with every Zinnia Convertible.
 These straps can be used to mount additional gear to the outside of the
 bag (tripod, blanket, jacket, yoga mat, etc...) for even more 
versatility using the handy mounting points on the bottom of the bag. 
(Estimated retail price of $19.99)






The Intrepid Tech Roll



The Intrepid Tech Roll is a completely unique tuck-and-roll 
organizational system for all your small tech items such as: cords, hard
 drives, battery back-up, plugs, power bricks, and more. Some have 
called it ""pure genius,"" a ""must-have,"" and ""the coolest thing we've 
seen in a long time."" We just call it ""Awesome.""






 The brilliance in this design is that you do not have remove any of 
the items from the Slate Grey canvas pockets to use them. Each has a 
pull-through plug opening that lets you both plug in and charge without 
removing anything from the Tech Roll, so everything always stays 
organized and tangle free. In addition to the cord pockets, there is a 
large covered pocket for storing a battery pack or hard drive. Just pull
 the plug through and you are ready to use it.






A zippered pocket is also there to put all your loose odds and ends 
in a safe place, it is even big enough to fit the entire power brick and
 charging cord for most laptops with room to spare! There is also two 
exterior specially sized mini pockets for SD Cards.  This all folds up 
elegantly and compactly into a Mahogany leather exterior that speaks for
 itself, with wrap-around straps for full secure expansion. This is 
especially great for travel because it is as simple as opening the Tech 
Roll and plugging in. No stray cords to lose, no fumbling around to find
 your small tech. When you are finished, just tuck and roll.




Featuring:

    Tuck-and-roll design means all chords, hard drives, and battery back ups are fully useable without removing them. 
    3 cord pockets with fully accessible plug openings
    Large covered pocket for hard drive or a battery backup, fully accessible
    Zippered pouch for loose gear, with exterior SD card mini-pockets
    100% Made in USA vegetable tanned full grain mahogany saddle leather
    Two Leather Wrap Around Straps for Secure Full Expansion
    UV- Resistant Marine-grade nylon stitching






Camera Strap





Meet the world's most durable, luxuriant, and comfortable leather 
camera strap. An ultra-soft and ergonomically designed shoulder pad that
 cradles your neck in a subtle moon shape, while 2 forged steel d-rings 
allow the strap to move freely without putting stress on the shoulders.





Secure locking hardware attaches to the tripod mount at the bottom of
 the camera allowing it to hang on your side so it is always in reach 
but never in the way. This allows the camera to slide freely along the 
strap for quick and easy usage.




Featuring:

    Ergonomically designed soft shoulder pad
    Adjustable length strap
    Free sliding forged steel hardware
    Secure locking tripod mount
    100% Made in USA vegetable tanned full grain Coffee saddle leather
    UV-Resistant Marine-grade nylon stitching






The Slim Wallet




The Intrepid Slim Wallet is a wallet for the minimalist with 4 boldly
 angled pockets that are perfect for storing the basics you need without
 all that extra bulk. It is constructed using rugged saddle stitching 
made from UV-resistant marine grade nylon that is also used in parachute
 construction, meaning this wallet will last. The wallet has a special RFID blocking material built in to keep your personal data personal. The full grain coffee 
saddle leather will age with you and only look better with day to day 
use. 




Our Story



We are a designer couple living in the Bay Area of San Francisco. As 
avid world travelers, language learners, volunteers, and artists we are 
always on the hunt for the perfect bags to take with us on our 
adventures, the kind of bags that will go anywhere, from the streets of 
Berkeley to the ruins of Ephesus, from the New York Rat Race to the 
Scotland Highlands, from our favorite neighborhood tea cafe to the 
fields of Darjeeling.
Last year we ran a kickstarter to launch our first two bags: the 
Journeyman Commuter and the Lillium Side-purse. The response was 
fantastic and the rave reviews speak for themselves. Here's just a few:
 ""I
 ask you: is there a better feeling than when someone says, ""awesome 
bag! Looks like something Indiana Jones would use."" Of course there 
isn't. Get this bag."" -Jeff P.
 ""I got this bag for my significant other and he loves it. Beautiful leather and craftsmanship- he uses it every day."" -Caitlyn F.
 ""I
 think these bags find the perfect balance between professional and 
casual. I take mine to work everyday. It fits my 15 inch laptop 
perfectly, and fits snugly enough that it doesn't get in the way during 
my train commute. Worth every penny."" -Chris B.
 ""I
 got this bag for my trip over the pond, but since I've been back home, I
 haven't wanted to give it up, so I'm using it every day. And, I just 
bought a 2nd one, to be sure that I have a backup in case something 
happens to mine and I can't replace it!"" -Linda C.

    ""Finest leather, perfect work, great design. The Lillium won’t be the last Intrepid stuff I buy, for sure!"" -Roland M.
However,
 we haven’t stopped there! After many hours of design and many many 
prototypes, our new line of products takes everything we learned from 
our first two bags and rolls them into a brand new lineup.




Each and every item is made by hand, the old-fashioned way, by 
craftsman who have been doing this for generations. Constructed from the
 highest quality materials in the world, and designed without 
compromise. The end results are conscientiously made, artfully crafted, 
heirloom quality products for modern day explorers and adventurers. 




Our Timeline and Production Plan

    August: Order materials and begin production on products

<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479708593/h3clg5ti9z62vn6upr3j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>

<p>A complete SDK interface is provided which allows developers a method for significant autonomous navigation research and development. The SDK works with Windows, Linux and Android operating systems with a Windows and Android demo program. Additionally, the NaviPack system provides a Web / Web Socket operation interface which can facilitate the development of PC programs based on NaviPack.</p>
<p>The SDK interface includes independent navigation, manual mapping, positioning navigation, map management and other basic navigation functions. Additional functions similar to automatic backfilling, custom sensor inputs and more are also provided. With the NaviPack system, developers will enjoy the option to expand sensor options and enhance the performance of existing NaviPack features. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>
<p>You can tell NaviPack to build a map using a graphical interface. The map can be built using either manual or automated methods.</p>
<div data-id=""14521034""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479700181/ta1bsqdpegw2qlyzgv14.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Positioning and navigation</strong></p>
<p>When you need to redefine your location, you can use the positioning interface to re-determine location. An important feature of NaviPack is that when the navigation system detects that the immediate location varies from the map, autonomous re-positioning will occur. If you want your robot to move from one place to another, simply issue a command. At that point with the help of NaviPack it will create the best route and intelligently proceed, adjusting route or position as necessary if any obstacles are encountered. </p>

With the built-in SLAM algorithm chip, Navipack is the first plug-and-play type of LIDAR navigation module. NaviPack is also the most affordable LiDAR solution for drones, robots and other devices and instantly enables them with powerful 360-degree sensing capabilities.

 

 
NaviPack integrates the SLAM algorithm with the LiDAR sensor module, making it super easy to use and significantly reducing development time.
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
NaviPack performs 360 degree scanning of its surroundings and all objects up to 15 meters away with a frequency of 4000 points per second. It is super easy to use! With the built-in SLAM module, it will start working immediately after plugging into your devices - scanning the environment, building a detailed map, and enabling auto-moving capability.

 

Navipack sensors can be 4000 points per second frequency of continuous scanning and perception of the surrounding environment, we will provide a different hardware interface and API allows you to deep integration of Navipack and UAV.

 

With NaviPack, the device will always find the best route to take after you give it a destination to move to.

 


 
 

NaviPack can be applied to the robots as their brain. Once plugged in NaviPack will manage the robot to avoid obstacles automatically.

 

 

Navipack's simple operation and useful features make it easy for students to add it onto a variety of carriers enabling them to move autonomously. Navipack has many common interfaces that can be combined with multiple sensors to enhance the versatility of the carrier for endless creative possibilities for students and hobbyists.

 

NaviPack can quickly construct and memorize its surrounding area. When there are other objects detected, NaviPack will immediately perceive whether it is a live person or other machinery and will track its trajectory to avoid any possible collision. 

 
 

 
 

The software is currently compatible with ROS, Linux, Windows, Android and other systems. In addition, we also provide the APP source code for development options for iPhone and iPad.
 
 

 
A complete SDK interface is provided which allows developers a method for significant autonomous navigation research and development. The SDK works with Windows, Linux and Android operating systems with a Windows and Android demo program. Additionally, the NaviPack system provides a Web / Web Socket operation interface which can facilitate the development of PC programs based on NaviPack.
The SDK interface includes independent navigation, manual mapping, positioning navigation, map management and other basic navigation functions. Additional functions similar to automatic backfilling, custom sensor inputs and more are also provided. With the NaviPack system, developers will enjoy the option to expand sensor options and enhance the performance of existing NaviPack features. 
 
Construction
You can tell NaviPack to build a map using a graphical interface. The map can be built using either manual or automated methods.

 
Positioning and navigation
When you need to redefine your location, you can use the positioning interface to re-determine location. An important feature of NaviPack is that when the navigation system detects that the immediate location varies from the map, autonomous re-positioning will occur. If you want your robot to move from one place to another, simply issue a command. At that point with the help of NaviPack it will create the best route and intelligently proceed, adjusting route or position as necessary if any obstacles are encountered. 

 
Sensor data
The NaviPack SDK supports the export of information from various sensors and the algorithm with one simple instruction. The SDK can easily collect all the data from a variety of sensors.

 
Log
Through the log interface, you can very clearly monitor and record the various activity information of NaviPack.

 
Demo

 

NaviPack is very simple to use. You can connect with NaviPack through Serial Port, USB, or WIFI.

My name is Jennifer Nnamani, founder of Beau Monde Society and creator of Fashion Envie. BMS is an eco-focused fashion startup  with one goal in mind; to build a sustainable future through our contributions, our support of ethical fashion initiatives, and partnership across different industries in promoting a better world. Since our launch in 2013, we have remained true to our mission by working with independent fashion designers and creatives that are celebrating higher ideals. </p>
<p><b>The Story</b>:</p>
<p>During a long train ride from Brooklyn back uptown, I was with a good friend of mine, Tamara Leacock of Reciclagem NY--who also happens to be an ethical fashion designer. I told her that I've noticed that there aren't enough platforms to highlight eco-friendly fashion and she agreed. I vowed then that I would start something (being in the fashion industry briefly as a model, I didn't witness enough sustainable fashion designers). I wasn't sure when I would start but I knew something must be done about it. This conversation took place in the Fall of 2012. Soon after, I had to find a name that would symbolize what I am trying to accomplish. There are so many fashion events in New York City and I didn't want this event to not have some meaning-- some purpose. After a few play with words, I came up with Fashion <b>Envie</b> meaning Fashion, Environment, &amp; Life--I chose April as that's Earth Month as supposed to February as it will conflict with  New York Fashion Week calendar.</p>
<p>As soon as I had the official event name and month, I embarked on instituting a company-- a brand that will encompass my versatile skill sets and in turn, act as an entity that will introduce the platform to the world. Beau Monde Society came after Fashion Envie. The mission of BMS is to approach unique projects by focusing on lifestyle branding while fusing fashion, creativity, and functional ideas to sustain brand awareness and ethical responsibility. Through our annual eco-collective, we have featured designers from different design backgrounds and inspirations. BMS has also offered them an array of creative services such as PR, brand consultation, social media strategies for an affordable fee. I know how difficult it can be to have a day job and at the same time, working almost 25 hours a day to make your dreams come true and not wanting to ask for any help because you can't afford it or not sure where to look for it. I've heard their stories and I know the importance of giving back or connecting them with the right people. </p>
<p>Fashion Envie offers our designers that platform to promote themselves/story/brand to diverse and eco-conscious guests (both new and seasoned). <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Plus, our designers get an opportunity to showcase their designs in ways they haven't done before. Some of the designers that have been featured in Fashion Envie shared that that was their first fashion showcase. For this year's installation entitled Oxo M o n o c h r o m e, we are adding two new features:</span></p> <ul> <li>1st ever F.U.N Roundtable Discussion: We are inviting members of the press to partake in a conversational series with our designers and other distinguished panelists to discuss ""Sustainable Future"" and how they are each adding something of value to that conversation. Our designers will also have a chance to have a one on one interview with press and promote their brand in significant ways. This event will be held at the Gibney Dance Theater</li> <li>Pop-up meets Fashion Presentation: This year's FE will feature a fashion presentation style setup as well as an opportunity for designers to sell their ""Ready to Wear"" designs, jewelry etc to guests that attend our day II on April 23rd at Caelum Art Gallery.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <ul> <li>Promotional Materials: Event flier design, printing needs (we are reducing our carbon footprint by promoting our event solely online and printing only what's needed), and Green Wall revamp (our version of step and repeat wall to feature all our designer's logos, sponsors, and partners).</li> <li>Entertainment: Music plays a crucial role in the curation of our event. With your small donation, our event can come to life.</li>
<li>Extra Props:  To go along with this year's theme, we will be renting out event props such as special lightning, interior decor, and gift bags for our guests</li> <li>Miscellaneous: Transportation and travel stipends for interns/volunteers, pre-event food lunch for creative team, models, and volunteers.</li> </ul>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li>PERKS: With a $ 20 support, you will receive a 2 day event pass to Fashion Envie</li>
<li>As a Fashion Envie supporter, you will receive an opportunity to meet our designers and shop their products before Fashion Envie's fashion presentation.</li>
<li>We will add more perks as our list of in-kind sponsors grow :)</li>
<li>If we don't make our goal, we will use all of the funds to an amazing 4th installation. Thank you!</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><ul>
<li>Fashion Envie meaning Fashion, Environment, and Life, highlights the interdependent relationship between these three important components. </li>
<li>Since our first installation, we have featured 10 independent and emerging designers in a curated space. We have provided them with press, a creative team, and feedback on their designing journey.</li>
<li>Our fundamental goal is to create a FUN atmosphere for all of our guests to enjoy--to have an experience like none other. A fashion presentation that awakens the senses and propagates the inevitable truth of efforts that our designers have taken to reduce environmental waste. By fusing fashion, art, and music, we have successfully created a platform that would showcase designers in a memorable and inspiring light.</li>
</ul><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>In creating a eco-focused fashion presentation featuring eco-friendly designs, there have been some challenges and risks. </p><ul>
<li>Challenges that have arisen are lack of familiarity with the designers and for some companies, the inability to allot funds/products due to their budgetary limitations, and increasing our press reach-- once again due to lack of familiarity. However, resiliency and consistency has yielded positive results. </li>
<li>Sponsors are eager to support a platform such as FE due to the lack of representation for eco-friendly designers. </li>
<li>Suitable location: FE's aesthetics thrive in a blank art space where we are able to transform the event space into our eco-collective theme. Finding suitable and affordable locations have become very rare and difficult. </li>
<li>By building an information press packet, sponsors are made aware of our past progress as well as future goals that we aim to accomplish through Fashion Envie. Another effective way to increase our press reach include and are not limited to expanding our network, expanding our search for writers passionate about the environment, and locations that would increase our overall reach as well.</li>
</ul><p>How you can help:</p><ul>
<li>Fashion as a culture is the most meaningful medium to transmit new ideas.

</ul><p></p><p></p></div>","Fashion Envie Welcome to our fundraising page! My name is Jennifer Nnamani, founder of Beau Monde Society and creator of Fashion Envie. BMS is an eco-focused fashion startup  with one goal in mind; to build a sustainable future through our contributions, our support of ethical fashion initiatives, and partnership across different industries in promoting a better world. Since our launch in 2013, we have remained true to our mission by working with independent fashion designers and creatives that are celebrating higher ideals. 
The Story:
During a long train ride from Brooklyn back uptown, I was with a good friend of mine, Tamara Leacock of Reciclagem NY--who also happens to be an ethical fashion designer. I told her that I've noticed that there aren't enough platforms to highlight eco-friendly fashion and she agreed. I vowed then that I would start something (being in the fashion industry briefly as a model, I didn't witness enough sustainable fashion designers). I wasn't sure when I would start but I knew something must be done about it. This conversation took place in the Fall of 2012. Soon after, I had to find a name that would symbolize what I am trying to accomplish. There are so many fashion events in New York City and I didn't want this event to not have some meaning-- some purpose. After a few play with words, I came up with Fashion Envie meaning Fashion, Environment, & Life--I chose April as that's Earth Month as supposed to February as it will conflict with  New York Fashion Week calendar.
As soon as I had the official event name and month, I embarked on instituting a company-- a brand that will encompass my versatile skill sets and in turn, act as an entity that will introduce the platform to the world. Beau Monde Society came after Fashion Envie. The mission of BMS is to approach unique projects by focusing on lifestyle branding while fusing fashion, creativity, and functional ideas to sustain brand awareness and ethical responsibility. Through our annual eco-collective, we have featured designers from different design backgrounds and inspirations. BMS has also offered them an array of creative services such as PR, brand consultation, social media strategies for an affordable fee. I know how difficult it can be to have a day job and at the same time, working almost 25 hours a day to make your dreams come true and not wanting to ask for any help because you can't afford it or not sure where to look for it. I've heard their stories and I know the importance of giving back or connecting them with the right people. 
Fashion Envie offers our designers that platform to promote themselves/story/brand to diverse and eco-conscious guests (both new and seasoned). Plus, our designers get an opportunity to showcase their designs in ways they haven't done before. Some of the designers that have been featured in Fashion Envie shared that that was their first fashion showcase. For this year's installation entitled Oxo M o n o c h r o m e, we are adding two new features:  1st ever F.U.N Roundtable Discussion: We are inviting members of the press to partake in a conversational series with our designers and other distinguished panelists to discuss ""Sustainable Future"" and how they are each adding something of value to that conversation. Our designers will also have a chance to have a one on one interview with press and promote their brand in significant ways. This event will be held at the Gibney Dance Theater Pop-up meets Fashion Presentation: This year's FE will feature a fashion presentation style setup as well as an opportunity for designers to sell their ""Ready to Wear"" designs, jewelry etc to guests that attend our day II on April 23rd at Caelum Art Gallery.
   What We Need   Promotional Materials: Event flier design, printing needs (we are reducing our carbon footprint by promoting our event solely online and printing only what's needed), and Green Wall revamp (our version of step and repeat wall to feature all our designer's logos, sponsors, and partners). Entertainment: Music plays a crucial role in the curation of our event. With your small donation, our event can come to life.
Extra Props:  To go along with this year's theme, we will be renting out event props such as special lightning, interior decor, and gift bags for our guests Miscellaneous: Transportation and travel stipends for interns/volunteers, pre-event food lunch for creative team, models, and volunteers.

   The Impact

Fashion Envie meaning Fashion, Environment, and Life, highlights the interdependent relationship between these three important components. 
Since our first installation, we have featured 10 independent and emerging designers in a curated space. We have provided them with press, a creative team, and feedback on their designing journey.
Our fundamental goal is to create a FUN atmosphere for all of our guests to enjoy--to have an experience like none other. A fashion presentation that awakens the senses and propagates the inevitable truth of efforts that our designers have taken to reduce environmental waste. By fusing fashion, art, and music, we have successfully created a platform that would showcase designers in a memorable and inspiring light.
Risks & ChallengesIn creating a eco-focused fashion presentation featuring eco-friendly designs, there have been some challenges and risks. 
Challenges that have arisen are lack of familiarity with the designers and for some companies, the inability to allot funds/products due to their budgetary limitations, and increasing our press reach-- once again due to lack of familiarity. However, resiliency and consistency has yielded positive results. 
Sponsors are eager to support a platform such as FE due to the lack of representation for eco-friendly designers. 
Suitable location: FE's aesthetics thrive in a blank art space where we are able to transform the event space into our eco-collective theme. Finding suitable and affordable locations have become very rare and difficult. 
By building an information press packet, sponsors are made aware of our past progress as well as future goals that we aim to accomplish through Fashion Envie. Another effective way to increase our press reach include and are not limited to expanding our network, expanding our search for writers passionate about the environment, and locations that would increase our overall reach as well.
How you can help:
Fashion as a culture is the most meaningful medium to transmit new ideas.

Put too much foam under the heel relative to the forefoot, and you’re at risk of the thick heel hitting first and throwing off your gait. Put too little, and you might not have enough cushion under your heel when going downhill or over rough terrain. If you watch just about any Kenyan runner, you’ll notice they land on their mid-foot or balls of their feet. So we’ve given the Iten a 4mm heel to toe drop, which is about half of most traditional running shoes.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467297803/ljtpudoz8emxp4s42ziy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Wider Toe Box: </strong>We created more space for the pinky toe than is found in many other shoes to ensure it’s not squished into or under its neighbor. A natural toe splay helps to absorb impact, which is why we went a bit wider to give the pinky some room to do its work</p><p><strong>Light Weight - 7.9 oz (224 grams): </strong> Lots of running shoes are classed as either trainers (read: thick and padded) or racing flats (read: thin and lots of ground feel). The Iten sits between those categories. With 21mm of cushioning under under heel and 17mm under forefoot, it's a shoe you can comfortably train in, but it's fast enough for race day.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467240945/uwpsoyvwgr3edm6afcuf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Midsole as Heel Counter: </strong>while the Iten is a 4mm drop shoe, we realize it looks like it has more of heel than this. That’s because we brought the midsole up to cup the heel. When viewed from behind you get a sense of how much the foot really sits down into the midsole. This helps the shoe move with your foot when you’re running on terrain that might have your foot hitting at a funny angle or rolling a bit.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467241004/bpze8giieqst5vasrqkb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Full Rubber Outsole: </strong>this gives you grip and protection on pavement and on other surfaces, such as light trails.

Colors:</strong> these have been selected to match the Kenyan flag.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467241064/hwhb0pgnieqvpntciegf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>2. Our Logo:</strong> it’s design is based on the image of a spear tip. The spear features throughout the history of Kenyan national identity, from the flag to being one of the highest honors that can be awarded to an individual in Kenya (Elder of the Burning Spear) — not unlike a knighthood or a presidential commendation.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467241112/jcd1i3in9di4bnssiih1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>3. Harambee Philosophy: </strong>Under the sole, you'll find the word ""Harambee"". It's the official motto of Kenya, and a value that drives us as a company. In Swahili it means “all pull together”, and is used to refer to moments where communities come together to accomplish something individuals couldn’t do alone – <strong>just as we are turning to you to ask for help in making Kenyan running shoes a reality.</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467241240/zmzkxhxlulwfobp3voag.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><p><strong>4. The Number 12:</strong> Jamhuri Day (Republic Day), the most important national holiday marking both the date Kenya gained independence in 1963 and the day, exactly one year later, when Kenya became a republic, is on the twelfth of December - or 12/12. That's why we’ve got exactly 12 lines on the lateral side of the Enda Iten.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467241301/emy68ws22mgajb3o0lzj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>5. The Great Rift Valley: </strong>most of Kenya’s running champions come from the rift valley. To honor them, and the valley’s unique high-altitude and mild climate that makes for the best training grounds in the world, the heel of Enda Itens is designed to mimic the valley and its great escarpments.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467241362/wrxahczpvohxlad00uag.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>6. Geometric Patterns and Repeating Triangle Motifs:</strong> these feature in many traditional Kenyan fabrics and beaded patterns. We've brought three variations of these patterns into the side mesh, the heel strap at the back and the outsole.</p><p>We hope you enjoy these little bits of Kenya and find the Iten’s a pair of shoes you’ll want to wear both out on a run and about town.</p><p> </p><h3>Sizing</h3><p>The critical thing for determining sizing is the last - a foot shaped mold around which the shoe is built. We worked with Jones &amp; Vining, who have over 80 years’ experience in developing lasts, because they’re well known in the shoe industry to be best in class. Using their lasts means the Enda Iten will fit true to size. </p><ul>
<li>If you don’t know your running shoe size, don't worry. You don't need to tell us until the campaign ends. Between now and then, there are a couple of things you can do: </li>
<li>You can go to a running or sporting goods store near you and try on a couple of shoes. Odds are the size for a Saucony Kinvara or Nike Free 5.0 will be the right size for your Enda Itens.  </li>
<li>If you can’t make it into a store, then consider that most people wear a running shoe that is slightly larger than normal shoe, since our feet swell when we run and you want a bit of extra room to move forward when running downhill. If you normally wear shoes that have a bit of room in the toe, just order that size. If your shoes are snug, then you might want to order your Enda Iten’s a half-size larger. </li>
</ul><h3> </h3><h3>How It’s Made</h3><p>The long term goal is for all components of Enda shoes to be made start to finish in Kenya. Sadly, a great deal of the equipment necessary to make a great running shoe simply can’t be found in Kenya. So we’re starting simple, with a plan to build on as we go.</p><p>This means that, initially, we’ll be sourcing the component pieces from Asia, and then building the shoes and packaging them here in Kenya. For the components we’re using two excellent facilities in China that also produce running shoes for other major international running shoe brands. </p><h3> </h3><h3>How We Got Here</h3><p>Making the Enda Iten has been a long process. It started out as an idea to make a truly Kenyan running shoe. In the 18 months since that start, we've worked with talented and experienced shoe designers, developers, and professional runners to create the ultimate running shoe. Two of the leading figures in this process have been:</p><p><strong>Steve Burris -</strong> Steve’s passion for running and coaching led him to join the original product development team at Nike’s Exeter, NH R&amp;D facility in the late 1970’s. He developed numerous commercially successful sport-shoe models for customers and world class athletes. In a 38 year career in athletic footwear &amp; apparel, Steve led global product development teams for adidas in Germany and Reebok in the USA and was production Country Manager in several Southeast Asian source countries. Steve has managed large organization logistics with notable success, and more recently assisted smaller brands such as Newton Running, and start-up brands in setting up product sourcing organizations. But his passion remains high performance product which helps athletes at every level maximize their potential. Steve retains excellent relationships with suppliers and infrastructure providers across the industry and is highly respected for his ability to build world class product sourcing capabilities which achieve the best balance of quality, timely delivery and pricing.</p><p><strong>Birdhaus Design</strong> -  With a team bringing experience Under Armour, Reebok, and Keen, Birdhaus is well versed in designing and manufacturing top quality athletic shoes. Birdhaus uses design thinking and strategy to deliver innovative solutions to clients around the world.</p><p>We've gone through many iterations of the design and created many prototypes in order to build a pair of shoes that are a joy to run in, while still looking great when wearing them around town. Through that process we've built a team of people around us - freelancers, volunteers, and suppliers - that make it feel like anything is possible with the shoe. We're excited to keep working with them to bring you this shoe and hopefully produce more shoes in the future.</p><h2> </h2><h2>About This Campaign</h2><p>We're excited to be asking the Indiegogo community for support because it means we can offer you the first ever Enda Iten shoes as a reward. </p><h3>Rewards</h3><p>Of course the prime reward is a pair of Enda Iten running shoes, but we've got a couple of other things going on. You'll find that we've paired these various offerings as stand alone items or in groups. Here's what you'll find:</p><p><strong>Thank You Mentions On Our Website </strong>- On a specially reserved space on our website, we will write your name and honour you for believing in us when all we had was nothing but a dream - and a prototype!</p><p><strong>Bracelets</strong> with the Kenyan flag on one side and Enda on the other. These have been designed and handmade with love from two different places - a small shop in Iten and by women from around the Maasai Mara area.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467241484/k625elvzsul1pia2pflq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>T- Shirts</strong> - show off your first run with these cool running tees paired up with your Enda Itens. They're made in Kenya of course. Only available in black for the moment.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467294311/jzlk5yfbmkoyft4c5sro.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>About Enda</h2><p>Enda (meaning ""Go!""in Swahili) is a social enterprise founded to bring Kenyan athletic greatness to runners around the world, and to bring sustainable income to Kenya. Enda was founded in 2015 as a Benefit Corporation by Navalayo (Nava) Osembo-Ombati and Weldon Kennedy.</p><p>Nava comes from a village near Eldoret, Kenya, where many of Kenya’s running champions come from. A graduate of the London School of Economics, Navalayo has worked in different places around the world, including the US, UK, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya. She is trained as both an accountant and a lawyer, which explains why she is so interested in risk management, results-based management and writing.</p><p>Weldon is a social-change campaigner who has worked on a range of early stage social change startups. He built the student and international member programs at The ONE Campaign and most recently led Change.org's growth in Europe as the regional Managing Director. An avid runner and running shoe obsessive, his half marathon PB is 1:37:39.</p><p>We met in Nairobi in early 2015 and immediately clicked. After a couple of conversations we decided to found Enda because we believe Kenya can, and should, benefit more from it’s well earned running reputation, and because we believe it will be good for runners everywhere to have a stronger connection to the culture and traditions of Kenyan running.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467241866/yng02o7wplxdhz3lpy79.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>Social Impact</h3><p>We are a social enterprise with a mission of increasing the amount Kenya benefits from its well earned reputation in running greatness. We’re working with social impact consultants, Global &amp; Smart, to ensure that we’re building a company that has creating social value at it’s core right from the start.</p><p><strong>1. Creating Jobs </strong></p><p>This is pretty straight forward. Kenya is a young country with a median age of 18 years. Frustratingly, youth unemployment in Kenya is 17%. Development experts and the Kenyan government agree that creating good jobs in sectors like manufacturing is one of the most important priorities for the country.</p><p>The challenge is that it is almost always cheaper and easier to produce goods in Southeast Asia. We plan on overcoming this obstacle by creating a brand that leverages the value of being made in Kenya, as well as taking advantage of preferential of tariff rates for importing footwear and apparel to the US under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The result will be bringing some quality jobs to Kenya.</p><p><strong>2. Supporting Local Communities</strong></p><p>Many Kenyans lack access to basic sanitation, clean water, adequate health care, and quality education. Thankfully many clever and courageous people are working to address these challenges. From experience, we know how hard it is for them to fund their activities. We want to make sure we’re making our contribution too, so here’s how we’re going to do this:</p><ul>
<li>We’ll set aside a portion of our profits into a pool (of money, not for swimming!);  Working with experts, we’ll identify a handful of most effective projects that could use some extra support every 6 months;</li>
<li>Anyone who buys a pair of Enda shoes and registers their purchase will get one vote to help us determine which projects will receive money from the pool;</li>
<li>Through this, we will link Enda runners across the globe to local communities in Kenya, and vice versa, and encourage empathy, creativity and innovation.</li>
</ul><p><strong>3. Changing The Way the World Sees Kenya</strong></p><p>Kenya is already famous for the world’s best runners, stunning wildlife, fantastic beaches, and where President Obama’s father came from (never mind the rest of our species some 60,000 years ago). We want to make it famous for great products too.</p><p>Most people couldn’t tell you exactly where their shoes are made. We want Enda runners to be able to take pride in knowing their running kit comes from Kenya, and that Kenyan products are of the highest quality. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467241928/q5sewcdcb37hl68074wm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Share Enda On Social Media</h3><p>Think we're amazing? Well then, don't keep it to yourself! Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and share us with your family and friends!!!</p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>We don’t think we’re the first people to think up the idea of making running shoes in Kenya. Certainly the idea has dawned on others, but they haven’t done it because it’s a downright difficult thing to do. Here are the top challenges we foresee, though knowing they might come up, we’re already working hard to mitigate their potential impact.</p><p>Import and Export Challenges - there are an increasing number of companies bringing materials into Kenya and exporting finished goods. The more companies do it, the smoother the process becomes. Still, the port at Mombasa is known to be challenging and slowdowns can occur. We’ll work with the best handling agents to mitigate this risk and hopefully be able to assemble and ship our shoes on schedule.</p><p>Shipping and Delivery - There may be other fees, forms or legalities we are unaware of that could block shipments of the shoes or cause them to be delayed or returned. While we're not experts on tax and other fees applicable to every country, we will do our best to ensure that your order arrives on time.</p><p>Consistency and Quality Control - when we start putting together a large volume of shoes for the first time, we’ll have to work hard to ensure they are consistently of the highest quality. We’re factoring this into our costs, and anticipate that there will be some shoes early on that won’t be up to our standards so we'll have some shoes we can’t ship.</p><p>Achieving Social Good Goals - all of our social good goals depend on us becoming a sustainable and scalable business. This Indiegogo campaign will get things rolling, but we’ll only really start creating jobs and revenue to Kenya if the attention and funds from the campaign get us to the point where we’re producing and selling a steady stream of shoes. So we’re already diving into a marketing plan for online sales, and will start selling to stores for the Spring 2017 season.</p><p>Sizing - we’ve worked hard to ensure our shoes run true to size. However, there’s always a chance that slight variations in foot shape mean that an Enda runner finds they need a slightly different size from their other running shoes. We’ll be using a distribution service to ensure returns are handled smoothly and efficiently.</p><p>Production Speed - making prototypes and a full production run are two totally different things, and there are likely unforeseen pitfalls we aren’t seeing yet. We don’t want to over-promise on this first production run, so we’ve added in extra padding on our production timelines. If we have any doubt that we’ll be able to hit delivery timelines we’ll be open and forthcoming so you know when to expect the shoes.</p></div>","About The ShoeKenya defines running excellence. Successive generations of athletes have come to understand and have perfected the art of running. Working together with them, we have created the ultimate running shoe.Throughout a year of design, development and testing, we strictly followed two principles:First: We knew our shoe had to be worthy of the Kenyan running tradition, which is second to none. We relied on expert craftsmanship and the best available materials at every turn in order to produce a top quality shoe.Second: We wanted a shoe that meets the needs of runners around the world by incorporating lessons from running in Kenya. We’re confident that we’ve made a shoe that fits both of those criteria: the Enda Iten, our debut design named after a small nondescript town in Kenya known for producing running champions. Technical Features 4mm Drop: The difference between the thickness of padding at the heel and under the forefoot can make a big difference on the way you run. Put too much foam under the heel relative to the forefoot, and you’re at risk of the thick heel hitting first and throwing off your gait. Put too little, and you might not have enough cushion under your heel when going downhill or over rough terrain.

Geometric Patterns and Repeating Triangle Motifs: these feature in many traditional Kenyan fabrics and beaded patterns. We've brought three variations of these patterns into the side mesh, the heel strap at the back and the outsole.We hope you enjoy these little bits of Kenya and find the Iten’s a pair of shoes you’ll want to wear both out on a run and about town. SizingThe critical thing for determining sizing is the last - a foot shaped mold around which the shoe is built. We worked with Jones & Vining, who have over 80 years’ experience in developing lasts, because they’re well known in the shoe industry to be best in class. Using their lasts means the Enda Iten will fit true to size. 
If you don’t know your running shoe size, don't worry. You don't need to tell us until the campaign ends. Between now and then, there are a couple of things you can do: 
You can go to a running or sporting goods store near you and try on a couple of shoes. Odds are the size for a Saucony Kinvara or Nike Free 5.0 will be the right size for your Enda Itens.  
If you can’t make it into a store, then consider that most people wear a running shoe that is slightly larger than normal shoe, since our feet swell when we run and you want a bit of extra room to move forward when running downhill. If you normally wear shoes that have a bit of room in the toe, just order that size. If your shoes are snug, then you might want to order your Enda Iten’s a half-size larger. 
 How It’s MadeThe long term goal is for all components of Enda shoes to be made start to finish in Kenya. Sadly, a great deal of the equipment necessary to make a great running shoe simply can’t be found in Kenya. So we’re starting simple, with a plan to build on as we go.This means that, initially, we’ll be sourcing the component pieces from Asia, and then building the shoes and packaging them here in Kenya. For the components we’re using two excellent facilities in China that also produce running shoes for other major international running shoe brands.  How We Got HereMaking the Enda Iten has been a long process. It started out as an idea to make a truly Kenyan running shoe. In the 18 months since that start, we've worked with talented and experienced shoe designers, developers, and professional runners to create the ultimate running shoe. Two of the leading figures in this process have been:Steve Burris - Steve’s passion for running and coaching led him to join the original product development team at Nike’s Exeter, NH R&D facility in the late 1970’s. He developed numerous commercially successful sport-shoe models for customers and world class athletes. In a 38 year career in athletic footwear & apparel, Steve led global product development teams for adidas in Germany and Reebok in the USA and was production Country Manager in several Southeast Asian source countries. Steve has managed large organization logistics with notable success, and more recently assisted smaller brands such as Newton Running, and start-up brands in setting up product sourcing organizations. But his passion remains high performance product which helps athletes at every level maximize their potential. Steve retains excellent relationships with suppliers and infrastructure providers across the industry and is highly respected for his ability to build world class product sourcing capabilities which achieve the best balance of quality, timely delivery and pricing.Birdhaus Design -  With a team bringing experience Under Armour, Reebok, and Keen, Birdhaus is well versed in designing and manufacturing top quality athletic shoes. Birdhaus uses design thinking and strategy to deliver innovative solutions to clients around the world.We've gone through many iterations of the design and created many prototypes in order to build a pair of shoes that are a joy to run in, while still looking great when wearing them around town. Through that process we've built a team of people around us - freelancers, volunteers, and suppliers - that make it feel like anything is possible with the shoe. We're excited to keep working with them to bring you this shoe and hopefully produce more shoes in the future. About This CampaignWe're excited to be asking the Indiegogo community for support because it means we can offer you the first ever Enda Iten shoes as a reward. RewardsOf course the prime reward is a pair of Enda Iten running shoes, but we've got a couple of other things going on. You'll find that we've paired these various offerings as stand alone items or in groups. Here's what you'll find:Thank You Mentions On Our Website - On a specially reserved space on our website, we will write your name and honour you for believing in us when all we had was nothing but a dream - and a prototype!Bracelets with the Kenyan flag on one side and Enda on the other. These have been designed and handmade with love from two different places - a small shop in Iten and by women from around the Maasai Mara area.T- Shirts - show off your first run with these cool running tees paired up with your Enda Itens. They're made in Kenya of course. Only available in black for the moment. About EndaEnda (meaning ""Go!""in Swahili) is a social enterprise founded to bring Kenyan athletic greatness to runners around the world, and to bring sustainable income to Kenya. Enda was founded in 2015 as a Benefit Corporation by Navalayo (Nava) Osembo-Ombati and Weldon Kennedy.Nava comes from a village near Eldoret, Kenya, where many of Kenya’s running champions come from. A graduate of the London School of Economics, Navalayo has worked in different places around the world, including the US, UK, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya. She is trained as both an accountant and a lawyer, which explains why she is so interested in risk management, results-based management and writing.Weldon is a social-change campaigner who has worked on a range of early stage social change startups. He built the student and international member programs at The ONE Campaign and most recently led Change.org's growth in Europe as the regional Managing Director. An avid runner and running shoe obsessive, his half marathon PB is 1:37:39.We met in Nairobi in early 2015 and immediately clicked. After a couple of conversations we decided to found Enda because we believe Kenya can, and should, benefit more from it’s well earned running reputation, and because we believe it will be good for runners everywhere to have a stronger connection to the culture and traditions of Kenyan running. Social ImpactWe are a social enterprise with a mission of increasing the amount Kenya benefits from its well earned reputation in running greatness. We’re working with social impact consultants, Global & Smart, to ensure that we’re building a company that has creating social value at it’s core right from the start.1. Creating Jobs This is pretty straight forward. Kenya is a young country with a median age of 18 years. Frustratingly, youth unemployment in Kenya is 17%. Development experts and the Kenyan government agree that creating good jobs in sectors like manufacturing is one of the most important priorities for the country.The challenge is that it is almost always cheaper and easier to produce goods in Southeast Asia. We plan on overcoming this obstacle by creating a brand that leverages the value of being made in Kenya, as well as taking advantage of preferential of tariff rates for importing footwear and apparel to the US under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The result will be bringing some quality jobs to Kenya.2. Supporting Local CommunitiesMany Kenyans lack access to basic sanitation, clean water, adequate health care, and quality education. Thankfully many clever and courageous people are working to address these challenges. From experience, we know how hard it is for them to fund their activities. We want to make sure we’re making our contribution too, so here’s how we’re going to do this:
We’ll set aside a portion of our profits into a pool (of money, not for swimming!);  Working with experts, we’ll identify a handful of most effective projects that could use some extra support every 6 months;
Anyone who buys a pair of Enda shoes and registers their purchase will get one vote to help us determine which projects will receive money from the pool;
Through this, we will link Enda runners across the globe to local communities in Kenya, and vice versa, and encourage empathy, creativity and innovation.
3. Changing The Way the World Sees KenyaKenya is already famous for the world’s best runners, stunning wildlife, fantastic beaches, and where President Obama’s father came from (never mind the rest of our species some 60,000 years ago). We want to make it famous for great products too.Most people couldn’t tell you exactly where their shoes are made. We want Enda runners to be able to take pride in knowing their running kit comes from Kenya, and that Kenyan products are of the highest quality. Share Enda On Social MediaThink we're amazing? Well then, don't keep it to yourself! Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and share us with your family and friends!!!Risks and challengesWe don’t think we’re the first people to think up the idea of making running shoes in Kenya. Certainly the idea has dawned on others, but they haven’t done it because it’s a downright difficult thing to do. Here are the top challenges we foresee, though knowing they might come up, we’re already working hard to mitigate their potential impact.Import and Export Challenges - there are an increasing number of companies bringing materials into Kenya and exporting finished goods. The more companies do it, the smoother the process becomes. Still, the port at Mombasa is known to be challenging and slowdowns can occur. We’ll work with the best handling agents to mitigate this risk and hopefully be able to assemble and ship our shoes on schedule.Shipping and Delivery - There may be other fees, forms or legalities we are unaware of that could block shipments of the shoes or cause them to be delayed or returned. While we're not experts on tax and other fees applicable to every country, we will do our best to ensure that your order arrives on time.Consistency and Quality Control - when we start putting together a large volume of shoes for the first time, we’ll have to work hard to ensure they are consistently of the highest quality. We’re factoring this into our costs, and anticipate that there will be some shoes early on that won’t be up to our standards so we'll have some shoes we can’t ship.Achieving Social Good Goals - all of our social good goals depend on us becoming a sustainable and scalable business. This Indiegogo campaign will get things rolling, but we’ll only really start creating jobs and revenue to Kenya if the attention and funds from the campaign get us to the point where we’re producing and selling a steady stream of shoes. So we’re already diving into a marketing plan for online sales, and will start selling to stores for the Spring 2017 season.Sizing - we’ve worked hard to ensure our shoes run true to size. However, there’s always a chance that slight variations in foot shape mean that an Enda runner finds they need a slightly different size from their other running shoes. We’ll be using a distribution service to ensure returns are handled smoothly and efficiently.Production Speed - making prototypes and a full production run are two totally different things, and there are likely unforeseen pitfalls we aren’t seeing yet. We don’t want to over-promise on this first production run, so we’ve added in extra padding on our production timelines. If we have any doubt that we’ll be able to hit delivery timelines we’ll be open and forthcoming so you know when to expect the shoes.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, my name is Michael and I have been a big Commodore fan since I had my first VC 20. For over 25 years I’ve been collecting everything by this company, totalling over 1,000 pieces: typewriters, desktop calculators, hand-held calculators and of course computers – I own almost every device Commodore ever produced, from the PET 2001 to the A4000T. </p>
<p>  So I was very excited when I heard of a campaign to finance new housings in a variety of colours. And what do new coloured housings need just as much as old ones? That’s right! New keycaps, without yellowing, available in a variety of colours. So the stunning look of a new housing won’t be ruined by ugly, old keys.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1376755/files/20150412101542-model_2_red.jpg?1428858942"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>
<p><br/>Unfortunately although injection moulded parts aren’t difficult to produce, the moulds and tools are extremely expensive. The injection mould for the Commodore C64 keys including planning and manufacturing would far exceed 40,000.- Dollars. Normally unaffordable since there is far too little demand, but now...</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1374028/files/20150411045022-headbalken_opportunity.jpg?1428753022"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Now there is a unique opportunity for all true C64 fans from around the world by two coinciding situations:<br/></p>
<p>    1. Thanks to a wonderful “lucky sod” from Dallas, new housings will be released in a variety of colours. Lots of people bought them, maybe including you. I am absolutely convinced  that many buyers will also want new, beautiful and matching keycaps, so currently there is a higher demand than ever before and probably ever will be.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1376788/files/20150412103549-Modell_1_B_B_V3.png?1428860149"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>    2. Through my job as a machine retailer for metal and plastic processing I meet a lot of people who deal with tool and mould making and even injection moulding. More specifically, we sell machines to these companies. So I would have the opportunity to have the right injection mould designed and manufactured far below the typical costs – and along with it, keycaps for our precious Commodore 64!</p>
<p></p>

<p>Once the campaign is completed and we have reached the goal, we commission a new injection mould for the keycaps and start the production right away!<br/></p>
<p>The keycaps will fit <strong>all common C64 versions</strong> such as:</p>
<p><strong> •	First C64 (breadbox)<br/>
  •	Aldi-C64<br/>
  •	Commodore 64C (C64-II)<br/>
  •	Commodore 64G - Super Game System</strong></p>
<p>The keycaps will also fit most <strong>VC 20</strong> &amp; <strong>C16</strong> and some <strong>CBM Systems</strong></p>
<p>Please check if your computer is compatible before buying. Simply remove a keycap and compare it with our picture. </p>

We will add more colours in the next few weeks. </div>
<div>The <b>translucent / frosted (like the 90ies iMacs G3)</b> upgrade perk is available from now! The colours are White (Snow), Black, Blue and Red.</div>

<p>The keys will be shipped in complete sets with all keycaps including function keys in the colour you ordered - e. g. Black. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1376790/files/20150412103711-Modell_1_BL_BL_V3_.png?1428860231"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p>If you want a combination like light blue keycaps with blue function keys you have to order an additional 4-piece set of blue functions keys. There is no other way because we can only use one colour per production run. </p>
<p> Please note – some spacebars and “Shift Lock” keys may need an additional base. You must keep those parts from the old keyboard!</p>
<p></p>

<p>The keycaps will be produced by mid August and will be shipped shortly thereafter. Packing and shipping worldwide (except the North and South Pole) is 10.- Euro. No matter where to and how many sets you order, you only pay 10.- Euro one-time fee! Please don’t forget to add this amount to your support!</p>

<p><b>How are the keycaps manufactured?</b></p>
<p>The keycaps are injection moulded in industrial production; the extremely high costs of the tool are also “to blame” for the finance amount of this campaign.</p>
<p><b>What shape will the keycaps be?</b></p>
<p>The shape of the keycaps will be as close to the classic concave shape as possible, each keyboard row will have its own shape with the correct angles and axes. Differences compared to the original keyboard will be minimal, if any. Under no circumstances will we produce the flat keyboard the C64X had.  </p>
<p><b>What material will the keycaps be made from and will this material yellow?</b></p>
<p>The keycaps are made from PC + ASA granulate. This very high quality plastic granulate is used in many fields, ranging from the medical field or the aircraft industry, all the way to the automotive industry. This granulate contains no additives so it is certain to prevent discolouration or yellowing.</p>
<p><b>How are the keys imprinted?</b></p>
<p>The keys are imprinted with the pad printing process, just as virtually all keyboards currently being manufactured. It provides a crisp and clear print image which stays clean for years, even with daily use.</p>
<p><b>Which keyboard layout is used?</b></p>
<p>Just as Commodore (z. B. C64G) at the time, we decided on complete printing from the top for financial reasons, the layout corresponds with the US International layout. Unfortunately, at this volume, printing the classic symbols on the front is unaffordable.</p>
<p><b>How can I choose the keytop colour?</b></p>
<p>Once the campaign has successfully ended, we will send you a link to our processing system shortly before production starts. Here you can then choose colours, order additional features, change the delivery address, or pay the shipping charges (if you forgot).  </p>
<p><b>Will you have transparent keycaps?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we offer translucent (like the 90ies iMac G3) keycaps in Snow, Blue and Red.</p>
<p><b>What about the “Commodore” key?</b></p>
<p>The name “Commodore” and the logo are still registered and using them without the trademark owner’s permission is prohibited. We’ve tried to contact the trademark owner several times, but to no avail. We plan (as shown in the pictures) to simply imprint the respective key with “C” or “C=”.</p>
<p><b>Will you also have other keyboard layouts?</b></p>
<p>Different layouts require different print templates. These add significant costs, and considering the volume it’s unfortunately not feasible.</p>
<p><b>Why aren’t there more colours to choose from at the moment?</b></p>
<p>Switching colours in production also involves costs. Costs for stopping production, cleaning the machine, and the production waste. We purposely did not include these added costs in the price; we were more focused on an inexpensive product than thousands of colours.</p>
<p><b>Why is shipping 10.- Euro more, not free of charge?</b></p>
<p>Because there is no such thing as free shipping. With free shipping, sellers simply “hide” the shipping costs in the retail price. We could have done the same, free shipping – but then every set would have been 29.- Euro. But this would have been unfair to those buying several sets or perks, since they would have paid multiple shipping charges. That’s why we offer the “Shipping” perk, which you only need to apply once. No matter how many sets you’re buying – saving you cash!</p></span></div>Thanks alot for your time and support!</span><br/><p></p>

The injection mould for the Commodore C64 keys including planning and manufacturing would far exceed 40,000.- Dollars. Normally unaffordable since there is far too little demand, but now...


Now there is a unique opportunity for all true C64 fans from around the world by two coinciding situations:
    1. Thanks to a wonderful “lucky sod” from Dallas, new housings will be released in a variety of colours. Lots of people bought them, maybe including you. I am absolutely convinced  that many buyers will also want new, beautiful and matching keycaps, so currently there is a higher demand than ever before and probably ever will be.



    2. Through my job as a machine retailer for metal and plastic processing I meet a lot of people who deal with tool and mould making and even injection moulding. More specifically, we sell machines to these companies. So I would have the opportunity to have the right injection mould designed and manufactured far below the typical costs – and along with it, keycaps for our precious Commodore 64!


Once the campaign is completed and we have reached the goal, we commission a new injection mould for the keycaps and start the production right away!
The keycaps will fit all common C64 versions such as:
 •	First C64 (breadbox)
  •	Aldi-C64
  •	Commodore 64C (C64-II)
  •	Commodore 64G - Super Game System
The keycaps will also fit most VC 20 & C16 and some CBM Systems
Please check if your computer is compatible before buying. Simply remove a keycap and compare it with our picture. 



Of course the keycaps will be produced in ALL classic colours to match the units in the list above. But also in some new colours. At the moment we are planning to produce the caps in following (classic & new ) colours:


We will add more colours in the next few weeks. 
The translucent / frosted (like the 90ies iMacs G3) upgrade perk is available from now! The colours are White (Snow), Black, Blue and Red.

The keys will be shipped in complete sets with all keycaps including function keys in the colour you ordered - e. g. Black. 
If you want a combination like light blue keycaps with blue function keys you have to order an additional 4-piece set of blue functions keys. There is no other way because we can only use one colour per production run. 
 Please note – some spacebars and “Shift Lock” keys may need an additional base. You must keep those parts from the old keyboard!


The keycaps will be produced by mid August and will be shipped shortly thereafter. Packing and shipping worldwide (except the North and South Pole) is 10.- Euro. No matter where to and how many sets you order, you only pay 10.- Euro one-time fee! Please don’t forget to add this amount to your support!


This is not the motto of our campaign, since we don’t see a high risk. Building injection moulds and producing injection moulded parts is not rocket science. It is beeing done hundreds of million times a day!

Production, distribution and shipping are also normal day-to-day business. For the past 10 years our company has supported and supplied thousands of customers worldwide, so distribution and shipping logistics are not a big challenge for us. We have years of experience in this field.







How are the keycaps manufactured?
The keycaps are injection moulded in industrial production; the extremely high costs of the tool are also “to blame” for the finance amount of this campaign.
What shape will the keycaps be?
The shape of the keycaps will be as close to the classic concave shape as possible, each keyboard row will have its own shape with the correct angles and axes. Differences compared to the original keyboard will be minimal, if any. Under no circumstances will we produce the flat keyboard the C64X had.  
What material will the keycaps be made from and will this material yellow?
The keycaps are made from PC + ASA granulate. This very high quality plastic granulate is used in many fields, ranging from the medical field or the aircraft industry, all the way to the automotive industry. This granulate contains no additives so it is certain to prevent discolouration or yellowing.
How are the keys imprinted?
The keys are imprinted with the pad printing process, just as virtually all keyboards currently being manufactured. It provides a crisp and clear print image which stays clean for years, even with daily use.
Which keyboard layout is used?
Just as Commodore (z. B. C64G) at the time, we decided on complete printing from the top for financial reasons, the layout corresponds with the US International layout. Unfortunately, at this volume, printing the classic symbols on the front is unaffordable.
How can I choose the keytop colour?
Once the campaign has successfully ended, we will send you a link to our processing system shortly before production starts. Here you can then choose colours, order additional features, change the delivery address, or pay the shipping charges (if you forgot).  
Will you have transparent keycaps?
Yes, we offer translucent (like the 90ies iMac G3) keycaps in Snow, Blue and Red.
What about the “Commodore” key?
The name “Commodore” and the logo are still registered and using them without the trademark owner’s permission is prohibited. We’ve tried to contact the trademark owner several times, but to no avail. We plan (as shown in the pictures) to simply imprint the respective key with “C” or “C=”.
Will you also have other keyboard layouts?
Different layouts require different print templates. These add significant costs, and considering the volume it’s unfortunately not feasible.
Why aren’t there more colours to choose from at the moment?
Switching colours in production also involves costs. Costs for stopping production, cleaning the machine, and the production waste. We purposely did not include these added costs in the price; we were more focused on an inexpensive product than thousands of colours.
Why is shipping 10.- Euro more, not free of charge?
Because there is no such thing as free shipping. With free shipping, sellers simply “hide” the shipping costs in the retail price. We could have done the same, free shipping – but then every set would have been 29.- Euro. But this would have been unfair to those buying several sets or perks, since they would have paid multiple shipping charges. That’s why we offer the “Shipping” perk, which you only need to apply once. No matter how many sets you’re buying – saving you cash!Thanks alot for your time and support!",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p class=""MsoNormal"">I do have a solution to this problem though – I want this new collection to be manufactured for me.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">I started this brand with no real funding and I continue to do so.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The new collection will consist of three brand new lingerie sets and a mini collection of knickers. The 'Luiza' set uses embroidered and beaded black chantilly lace in an open cup wired bra and matching hip-fin short. 'Ela' is a revamp of an older one-off design and uses metallic gold and rose leavers lace in a signature strappy soft cup bra and high waisted brief. 'Monika' is a champagne chantilly lace set with a brief and soft bra.  The knicker collection will be based around my collection of vintage kimono fabrics, with high-waisted briefs and matching pasties. Each design will be one-of-a-kind due to the finite nature of the fabrics!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/>If I raise enough money I will also have some of my last collection's 'strappy' designs put into production and make them permanently available.

<p> </p>
<p> As my wife and I drove to a family gathering, We were talking about church that morning that I had attended. The discussion was; doing for others. It got both of us to thinking, what can we do right now to help others that we ourselves take for granted and at that moment it happened. A gentleman was standing on the corner of our intersection not asking for money but food… Anything if possible, now normally I DO NOT ever give money to the homeless but food, that is a different story. We were in route to a family dinner and had 4 loafs of artisan bread with us, without even discussing it both my wife and I reached to grab one to give to him and we kind of laughed at first that we had the same idea at the same time. We gave the man the food and he called over 2 other family members waiting in a car nearby and split it between them 2 very small kids and his wife and yes it does seem they were living out of the car. We didn’t stop for long as we were already late but , the whole rest of the trip we started thinking how can you make a balanced meal and spend the least amount of money, to maximize the amount of people you can affect….</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need: Funding             </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are looking to raise at the very least $200, with that much money we can feed 220 people.</li>
<li>We found a way to make a sack lunch with a Ham and cheese sandwich, bag of veggie sticks\chips and a bottle of water for only .97 cents each, shopping off name brands and in bulk.</li>

<p><strong>The Impact:<br/><br/></strong></p>
<p>With a simple $4.00 donation you can feed a family of 4 people that might not otherwise have a meal that day… This is going to directly affect hungry persons here in your back yard. We are hoping that this will catch on and people can start a Brown Bag Project in their own hometowns, so that America’s hungry are no more. We are not giving these things out at a church or community center we are going to find these persons on our own, face to face in our community.</p></span></div>","The Day it Happened:

<hr/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Don't run to the nearest shoe store - not just yet. Ariana is not an existing product at the moment, but the good news is it's not sci-fi anymore. It actually combines 
already existing technologies in a very unique way. Well, we added our 
own little inventions to the formula, of course, but nothing you can see
 here is out of our reach today.<br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We hope it won't take much to recognize the potential in Ariana, and to get the urge of being part of this awfully big adventure. Cause trust me, it's going to be - that is if you're willing to support and help us make it happen.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Too much talk, I know. To the point then.<br/><br/></p><h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">What is Ariana?</h1><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Actually it’s exactly what you just saw in our little commercial. An ordinary pair of shoes – at least that’s what it looks like. In reality it has the ability to change the colour of the shoe’s surface, but not just that. If you had a pair of Arianas (and we strongly hope you will have in the foreseeable future) you could put any kind of decoration on them as if they were a blank piece of paper. The only limitation is the number of colours. You can use three of them on one pair of shoes: black, white plus one of your choice.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So when you walk into a store to buy a pair of Arianas, you have to decide, what the third colour should be? Let’s say your favorite colour is red - in this case you probably want to buy a pair of red Arianas. That means the three colours your new shoes will be able to handle are black, white, and RED. If you’d like to take home a blue Ariana however, the colours that version will have are white, black and BLUE. Simple enough. There will be, of course, green Arianas, brown, orange, gold, you name it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As you can see, the white and the black colours are always there, every member of the Ariana family will have them. These two would be enough themselves to put any kind of patterns on your shoes, but with the third colour the possibilities literally become limitless. It's up to your imagination.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I hope it’s not too difficult to follow me, but just to be sure, we set up a little animation to show you what I’m talking about.<br/><br/></p><h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">Diving into details<br/>
</h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We took a red Ariana for this example and started with the basics. We can set our shoes to be completely white, or black or red. Then it’s time to spice things up a little. Let’s put some decoration on our shoes. (We've picked a nice floral pattern, but it could be anything else.)</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is where the real fun begins: We can put our black pattern on a white background. Then let's switch the colour of our pattern to red. Now it's time to change the background colour. Let it be black. In that case we can colour the pattern white and red. And if we go with red as the background, the decoration can be white and black. Sounds too complicated? Just take a look at the video and everything will be clear as day, I’m sure.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F23ihOq1yInE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D23ihOq1yInE&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F23ihOq1yInE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We kept it pretty simple for educational purposes, but of course there is no limitation in using the three colours our shoes have. Another example: a simple (all-time classic) zebra pattern. Black and white, looks like this, cool.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/910679/files/20141007053406-zebra-example-01.jpg?1412685246"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We can do this inverted anytime (white on black), but it wouldn't look much different, so we just skip that. Now let's put our third colour to work. Red on white. Nice.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/910687/files/20141007053522-zebra-example-02.jpg?1412685322"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Okay, what's next? Black on red.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/910692/files/20141007053637-zebra-example-03.jpg?1412685397"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Wow, flames. But that's still not all, it's time to go wild with mixing our colours. Of course we can do it as freely as we want. See?</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/910697/files/20141007053824-zebra-example-04.jpg?1412685504"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">It's the same pattern and we still didn't cover all the variations, not nearly. The real beauty of it is that we only used our three colours all the way. I could go on practically forever, but you got the point by now, I'm sure.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now what’s the real kicker here? We’re still talking about the SAME PAIR OF SHOES, since ONE red Ariana can do all this for you! It can look like any of the examples above and many, many other ways. One pair of shoes. Just think about it.<br/><br/></p><h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">This is how you do it<br/>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">And how can you make your shoes change their appearance? It's pretty easy. Via an application on your smartphone, wirelessly. Just like in our little commercial. Every pair of Arianas will be shipped with a software, specifically linked to those pair of shoes. This way you can be sure that the look of your shoes can not be controlled using some other phone than your own.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Upon installing the software on your phone the application is going to allow you to compile any new look (or skin if you prefer to call it that way) for your shoes in a very user friendly way. You can visually set everything up before “arming” and then you can send the new look with one touch of your finger onto the shoes. They will change their appearance in an instant. Just like that.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now the communication between the shoes and the phone requires some built in electronics, but the look and feel of the changeable surface will be perfectly natural, without any glow or illumination - just like any pair of ordinary shoes. Only the Ariana logo will give it away, but we’re going to place that somewhere more discreet.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The energy consumption of the whole system is going to be very low, so we don’t plan to use a battery that needs frequent changing. Our battery is going to recharge itself using the kinetic energy generated by yourself as you walk around in the shoes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For the development of a fully functional protoype and for the pre-manufacturing process we need more funds than we can come up with on our own. Our goal is to give you something that makes wearing shoes a truly creative and fun experience. Project Ariana, above all, is about to make your shoes more... you. By giving you the freedom to change the look of your shoes at will, this technology will take personalization to a whole new level. You can put anything on your shoes from your astrological sign to your favorite tattoos or even emoticons reflecting your current mood.<br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">You can have a totally new look every day, or every hour or every five minutes if that's what you want. Like putting on new shoes anytime you feel like it without taking them off and you don't even have to rely on designers' ideas. You can design your own dream shoes. Isn't it the coolest?<br/><br/></p><h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">What to wear today?<br/>
</h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">You can create any shapes or patterns to your liking. From the most basic elements like dots or stripes to really complex drawings and artworks, even text in different fonts. Think of the surface of the shoes as an empty canvas. We give you three colours, the rest is up to you. Knock yourself out, design, draw, paint anything you like combining these colours freely, and wear it as long as you feel comfortable. Of course, you can save these looks to use them later again. And again. Anytime.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Not so much of an artist yourself? No problem! We're going to set up a website with tons of readymade designs. You only have to choose the one you like the most, download it and apply it on your shoes. Good, but not perfect? It would only need a little customization? Sure, why not? No one's going to stop you, you can do it yourself. And if you are the creative type you can upload your own drawings and designs to the website and share them with others. Who knows when you will meet them walking on the street?<br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/910703/files/20141007054009-ariana-variations.jpg?1412685609"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The control software on your phone is not going to be the only tool you can use to create your designs. For the more complex drawings or artworks there will be the usual image editors on your desktop computer, laptop or tablet. You can use Photoshop, Gimp, Artweaver or any other software and save the end result in universal formats like .JPG or .PNG. Of course you're going to have to make sure you don’t use more colours than your Ariana can handle. (You don’t have to worry about using that exact red or blue or any other third colour your Ariana have, we’re going to convert everything to the right shade of the third colour that is not black or white in the picture.)</p><p></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now the images and videos show only high heels, but of course Ariana could come in numerous different shapes and sizes.

This means that shoes primarily designed for sports or other form of intensive physical exercise are not going to be in our focus for now, but the look is not the highest priority for those anyway.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The other reason we used women’s shoes in our examples is that we have a feeling Ariana will be a wee bit more popular among the ladies, but of course we could well be gravely mistaken. So gentlemen are definitely not excluded. Or think about the kids! It's enough to buy a pair of Ariana to make them happy - and very busy - for the rest of the shoes' life span.

Don't run to the nearest shoe store - not just yet. Ariana is not an existing product at the moment, but the good news is it's not sci-fi anymore. It actually combines 
already existing technologies in a very unique way. Well, we added our 
own little inventions to the formula, of course, but nothing you can see
 here is out of our reach today.We hope it won't take much to recognize the potential in Ariana, and to get the urge of being part of this awfully big adventure. Cause trust me, it's going to be - that is if you're willing to support and help us make it happen.
Too much talk, I know. To the point then.What is Ariana?Actually it’s exactly what you just saw in our little commercial. An ordinary pair of shoes – at least that’s what it looks like. In reality it has the ability to change the colour of the shoe’s surface, but not just that. If you had a pair of Arianas (and we strongly hope you will have in the foreseeable future) you could put any kind of decoration on them as if they were a blank piece of paper. The only limitation is the number of colours. You can use three of them on one pair of shoes: black, white plus one of your choice.
So when you walk into a store to buy a pair of Arianas, you have to decide, what the third colour should be? Let’s say your favorite colour is red - in this case you probably want to buy a pair of red Arianas. That means the three colours your new shoes will be able to handle are black, white, and RED. If you’d like to take home a blue Ariana however, the colours that version will have are white, black and BLUE. Simple enough. There will be, of course, green Arianas, brown, orange, gold, you name it.
As you can see, the white and the black colours are always there, every member of the Ariana family will have them. These two would be enough themselves to put any kind of patterns on your shoes, but with the third colour the possibilities literally become limitless. It's up to your imagination.
I hope it’s not too difficult to follow me, but just to be sure, we set up a little animation to show you what I’m talking about.Diving into details

We took a red Ariana for this example and started with the basics. We can set our shoes to be completely white, or black or red. Then it’s time to spice things up a little. Let’s put some decoration on our shoes. (We've picked a nice floral pattern, but it could be anything else.)This is where the real fun begins: We can put our black pattern on a white background. Then let's switch the colour of our pattern to red. Now it's time to change the background colour. Let it be black. In that case we can colour the pattern white and red. And if we go with red as the background, the decoration can be white and black. Sounds too complicated? Just take a look at the video and everything will be clear as day, I’m sure.
We kept it pretty simple for educational purposes, but of course there is no limitation in using the three colours our shoes have. Another example: a simple (all-time classic) zebra pattern. Black and white, looks like this, cool.We can do this inverted anytime (white on black), but it wouldn't look much different, so we just skip that. Now let's put our third colour to work. Red on white. Nice.
Okay, what's next? Black on red.
Wow, flames. But that's still not all, it's time to go wild with mixing our colours. Of course we can do it as freely as we want. See?It's the same pattern and we still didn't cover all the variations, not nearly. The real beauty of it is that we only used our three colours all the way. I could go on practically forever, but you got the point by now, I'm sure.
Now what’s the real kicker here? We’re still talking about the SAME PAIR OF SHOES, since ONE red Ariana can do all this for you! It can look like any of the examples above and many, many other ways. One pair of shoes. Just think about it.This is how you do it

And how can you make your shoes change their appearance? It's pretty easy. Via an application on your smartphone, wirelessly. Just like in our little commercial.

What is ""Empreintes des pilotes""?




ENGLISH  :
The ""Empreintes des pilotes"" mounted in the middle of downtown Le Mans memorialized in bronze the winners of ""24 heures du Mans"".

At the end of the race, the winners made their handprints on the plasterboard. One plate is then cast in the ground, and et the following year, juste before the race, we celebrate winners on the occasion of the inauguration of the newest plate.


FRANÇAIS  :
Les ""Empreintes des pilotes"" disposées en plein centre ville du Mans immortalisent dans le bronze et sur le sol les vainqueurs des ""24 heures du Mans"".
A la fin de chaque course, les vainqueurs posent leurs empreintes dans le plâtre. Une plaque est ensuite coulée dans le sol des rues du quartier, et l'année suivante, l'inauguration de cette nouvelle plaque a lieu la veille de la course.

<p>    I've been working with leather for about eight years now and want to up my production capability with a <strong>leather sewing machine</strong>.  Working with and being creative with leather is a great passion of mine.</p>
<p>In the beginning I started out with leather bracelets and bracers as an experimentation and for myself and friends. The items became great gifts that I could give that were personal and uniquely created for a specific person. I started to get more into custom cigar cases over the past year and a half.</p>
<p>These cases have been my hottest items.  There is a lot of hand stitching involved in every case.  Demand has been growing rapidly for my custom cigar cases. So much so, I  haven't been able to keep up with the demand, and have had to limit my orders due to the time it takes to put these cases together.  Each case is prepped for stitching by aligning the stitch line, pre-punching each hole, and then hand stitching each half of the case which takes about 30 minutes each.  <em><strong>This time taken would be reduced to just minutes with a sewing machine.</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The amount needed for this campaign is $1500</p>
<p>This amount gives the the huge opportunity to purchase a leather sewing machine and specific sewing supplies.  I want to purchase this machine locally at a cincinnati based industrial sewing machine company. This way I can also help support our local economy along with my local business. </p>

<h4><u><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our Story</span></u></h4>
<h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">I am a final year fashion design student at The London College of Fashion. For my degree project I am designing and producing a new fashion magazine. The premise for the magazine is to showcase the most individual, stylish, original and talented women, regardless of age.</span></h4>
<div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></div>
<h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><u>The Impact</u><br/></span></h4>
<h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">The fashion industry does not equate ageing with beauty, and I believe that this is not only ridiculous but quite the opposite. <br/></span></h4>
<h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">This will be a fashion magazine that features women of all ages, with cutting edge fashion shoots and original interviews, such as one with legendary fashion editor for Nova magazine and style icon Molly Parkin, who offered her thoughts on SuperWomen: "" I applaud you and it"". </span></h4>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: separate; font-size: 9px;""><h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">With innovative fashion features and profiles, this magazine aims to offer high quality, intelligently written and exciting editorial that stands out amongst the thousands of mainstream fashion magazines dishing out the same thing!<br/></span></h4></span><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""1""><h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h4></font><h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u><br/></span></h4>
<h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h4>
<h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">To make this happen I am asking people to donate as much as they can, no amount is too small, so that I can fund the expensive process of printing, publishing and distributing the magazine. Printing just one copy will cost me about £160 or roughly $260, but if I print more then the price goes down, so I would love to be able to print at least 500 copies.<br/></span></h4>

</div></div>","Our Story
I am a final year fashion design student at The London College of Fashion. For my degree project I am designing and producing a new fashion magazine. The premise for the magazine is to showcase the most individual, stylish, original and talented women, regardless of age.

The Impact
The fashion industry does not equate ageing with beauty, and I believe that this is not only ridiculous but quite the opposite. 
This will be a fashion magazine that features women of all ages, with cutting edge fashion shoots and original interviews, such as one with legendary fashion editor for Nova magazine and style icon Molly Parkin, who offered her thoughts on SuperWomen: "" I applaud you and it"". 
With innovative fashion features and profiles, this magazine aims to offer high quality, intelligently written and exciting editorial that stands out amongst the thousands of mainstream fashion magazines dishing out the same thing!What We Need & What You Get

To make this happen I am asking people to donate as much as they can, no amount is too small, so that I can fund the expensive process of printing, publishing and distributing the magazine. Printing just one copy will cost me about £160 or roughly $260, but if I print more then the price goes down, so I would love to be able to print at least 500 copies.
 I believe so strongly in this idea, and I want to reach out and inspire other people with the independence, style, and confidence of the women featured in the magazine. By donating you will significantly change this project and my life, as I would love to continue this project to a second issue and beyond! 
All the money raised will go on project costs and if anybody donates over $100 they will receive a personalised SuperWomen postcard, and you will receive an honorary thank you mention in the magazine! Donate over $500 and you will receive all of the above plus a limited edition copy of the magazine!
So if you believe that beauty has no age limit, and you want to see a fashion magazine that celebrates individuality and uniqueness then please donate! Thank you so so so much!

<h1><strong>Why We Need YOUR Help:</strong></h1>
<p>So we don't want to bad quality printing, nor uncomfortable clothes. And we want them to last. The comfort quality, and print quality has a price. This costs lots of money, money we need to make your shirts! We want to give you top quality clothes with designs you'll love, using different printing styles, but primarily silk-screen, which unfortunately is the most expensive, but most sustainable too.</p>
<h1><strong>How We'll Do It: </strong></h1>
<p>We plan on starting off doing men's and women's tops; Tee Shirts, Sweatshirts, Sweaters, Hoodies, etc. Sizes: XS, S, M, L, and XL. We have researched tons of T-Shirt and Clothing manufacturers to provide for us, and we are still figuring it out based on quality and price. Our research on printing has ranged from extremely low prices to extremely high, but we want to give you the best quality (not necessarily the most expensive, just the most comfortable and best looking, For reasonable prices.) For the Stickers, we have only ordered from ""The Sticker Guy"" to test the quality first, and once confirmed we can start printing those too.</p></div>","BLUB

<p>Hello everyone, this is the last call for ""UChicago: The Original Order of the Phoenix t-shirts"". If you want a shirt, it is important to buy it now as there are a limited number of shirts in each size/style. There are two shirt choices - a Gildan shirt or a higher quality American Apparel shirt.</p>
<p>The shirts will be available for pick-up on Tuesday, October 28th from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM and Saturday the 1st from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM in or outside of the Regenstein Library (I can't reserve a room until 1 week before) but you will be emailed the exact location. You can also contact me at Katalina Kimball@gmail.com. If you really can't make either of the times above, please leave a comment on this campaign's page and we will work something out.</p>
<p>If you live in South, Max P, B.J, or Snell-Hitchcock, I'm considering having some of the shirts delivered. I haven't decided yet but, if you would prefer this to picking the shirt up, you should be able to include your address when you order.</p>
<p>To those of you that pre-ordered, I'm sorry but the special pre-order price is no longer available. I'm glad that so many of you had the opportunity to buy a shirt at the special price, but it would be too complicated to continue this as I am abroad and someone else will be distributing the shirts.</p>

<p>I did not grow up sewing, although I grew up around it. My mom was into a variety of needle crafts. If you would have told me when I was younger that I would not only sew, but have a business based on sewing I would have laughhed at you. Like most young people I could not predict what life would throw my way. In 2008, my 3 week old son, cooper, died after open heart surgery. My creative outlet had always been knitting, but it  no longer quieted my mind or calmed the storm raging inside me. I needed something more. As a former knitting shop owner, color spoke to me, but it was no longer in the form of yarn, fabric was its replacement. I taught myself how to sew as a way to heal my heart, honor my son and keep living. The creative process saved me. As a result lucends was born.</p>
<p>I like to take simple shapes and forms and give them a modern feel. Color fuels my soul and is the inspiration for each piece. My pieces are unique because each one is one of kind, ensuring that each item is not only one that my customers love but is a piece of art, as well. All items are made by in my home studio, usually while my two year old son Chace is either at school or napping. I believe wholeheartedly in the handmade process, ensuring that my hands and only my hands work on each lucends product. Each piece of work is made with a great deal of love, time and care. I want my work to help customers feel an often times intangible emotion, love.</p>
<p><strong><strong>THE PROJECT:</strong></strong></p>
<p>lucends continues to steadily grow year to year, sales have doubled each year since opening and are on track to at least double last years sales. In order to continue to grow, I need a <strong>comprehensive and cohesive website</strong>. One that portrays who I am and what lucends is all about, as well as serves an online marketplace for lucends products. Because lucends has developed and grown very organically I have various pieces in of the puzzle in place, but I need them to be sewn together in a cohesive way. </p>
<p>This is where you come in... With your funding and support lucends will have a professionally designed website that encompasses all of who I am as a company, one that represents a journey of growth, healing and an immeasurable amount of love. I will be extremely honored, very grateful and downright giddy if you would join me on this adventure that fuels my creative soul, honors my sweet son cooper, and spreads love across the country piece by piece.</p>
<p>I hope that you will join me on this creative journey. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! I can’t THANK YOU enough for visiting my fundraising page on indiegogo.  That’s What SHE Said Sports LLC is a sports show I created because not only am I a diehard sports fan but this show is something that I’ve dreamed about for a long time.  I have been a sports fan since I was little girl (thanks Dad!) I can’t remember a time when sports didn’t play an integral part of my life.  To this day depending on what’s on TV my dad and I will discuss and breakdown a game, the athletes and then disagree on who is going to win – I love it.  I remember telling my dad that I wanted to win the Heisman trophy and be a quarterback in the NFL – he just smiled never discouraging me.  My background is in broadcasting and journalism – I’ve done talk radio and TV news.  But my passion has always been sports. </p>
<p>So while going back to graduate school I knew doing my own sports show was what I wanted to do.  Currently, I do a sports podcast with my “Co-Dude” Byron Grover aka Bee Gee.  It’s amazing when you’re doing something your passionate about – it doesn’t feel like work.  My goal is to move our podcast to television by September.  We’ve also been successful doing live shows at sports bars and have created an amazing following using social media. </p>
<p>This campaign will allow us to do that – I’ve always believed if you are going to dream – why not dream big! Your contributions will make this happen - I’m shooting for my Heisman trophy by doing this sports show on local television twice a week.  I feel once we get on the air locally the sky’s the limit and then one day we go national!</p>
<p> </p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>You have to start somewhere – right now That’s What SHE Said Sports has its own YouTube channel   <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/TWSSSports?feature=sub_widget_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/TWSSSports?feature=sub_widget_1</a>   and we have been successful with our podcasts <a href=""http://thatswhatshesaidsports.podbean.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://thatswhatshesaidsports.podbean.com/</a>  and <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/thats-what-she-said-sports/id594293101?mt=2nd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/thats-what-she-said-sports/id594293101?mt=2nd</a></p>
<p>With your contributions we get the opportunity to evolve and put our show on television.  Our vision is to be the #1 sports show on television while maintaining integrity. We will use the show as a platform to assist those in need in the community, educate and inspire.</p>
<p>Putting a show on television cost money and by raising $40,000 we can pay for 10 months of air time this will allow us to produce two 30 minute shows twice a week on a local station here in Atlanta, Georgia. Any additional funds will help buy more equipment - we can use another camera and more lights. I don’t want to think about “what if we don’t get our goal amount needed” because whatever we get it will be one step closer to getting on television.</p>
<p>We have some awesome perks to show you how appreciative we are of every dollar we raise.  We have everything from mugs, t-shirts, fan “shout outs” and a special invite to our launch party before the show starts in September.  We have autographed t-shirts and hats by some of the Atlanta Falcons. Ever wanted to be a producer? Well here you go and if you would like host one of our live shows first hand – we can do that too.  </p>
<h3> The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Your contributions will be fulfilling a life-long dream.  Ever since I can remember family and friends have told me “You need to be on television” or “You ever thought about doing your own sports show?”  I can’t tell you how excited I am about this show and how I’ve been so blessed to have such great support from all those who I talk to about the show.  </p>
<p>Just think one day you will be able to say “I remember when I helped get her show on TV” like I said before the sky’s the limit with That’s What SHE Said Sports.</p>
<p>Remember everyone we know who has been successful on TV had to start somewhere and I’m proud to be starting with you all and this indiegogo campaign!</p>
<p>Thank you and God bless!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Our Pure T-shirt  MEN/WOMEN 




We need funds to re-engineer this mold so we can increase our output.
Time Line: 







Our Mission: We need to raise $2,500 to launch PURE. The funds will go towards buying material and re-engineering the molds needed to make our headphones.

What is Pure? 
Pure is a southern California based company that emphasizes comfort, sound, and style. Simply put, we aim to be the most comfortable and unique headphones on the market. 
Short Summary

I've always had a passion for creating, and designing things. I’ll look at something and think of a new way to make it look more appealing or functional. That's what I did with PURE. 
 I started Pure to give people a product that they can appreciate. I hope with this campaign I can raise enough money to make the first batch of headphones and really make an impact on the people who will wear them. 
Any contribution helps, and regardless of the size of contribution you will receive something in return.  Buying material in bulk and re-engineering the molds will be expensive, and its something that this 20 year old college student doesn't have. Securing funding to fully launch Pure will be challenging, but with recent help from local investors and your help I know it can be accomplished.

 $20 gets you a PURE Headphone in any color

<p>Having
had a walk at a

near Athens, we discovered huge amounts of sea grasses (Posidonia Oceanica),
which many people consider it as rubbish.The sea grass is collected
by municipalities and discarded to landfill. It costs these municipalities a
lot of money to dispose of and the seagrassgoes to waste. In Greece,
a country deeply sunken due to crisis, we pay to E.U. huge amounts of money as
fines for the rubbish and, for this wasted valuable material. </p>
<p>Having
researched about this unparalleled material, we realised its potential and
value. Experimentation led us to develop innovative products from sea-grass
that in some cases could replace other harmful materials or products due to its
unique properties. </p>
<p>We
have started handling, experimenting and shaping sea grass in various ways,
learning new techniques and procedures. As we were training ourselves, sea
grass started to train and educate us in its terms, possibilities and ways. </p>
<p>We
developed wall
panels as tapestry that
can be applied directly to walls.The panels have good thermal and sound
insulation abilities, absorb moisture and CO2 from the air. (We are
planning to make research our priority). Other products we have developed are

<h2 align=""center"">HIP-D: Help Protect Grandma </h2>
<p>Grandma and Grandpa should enjoy life without worrying about falling and injuring themselves, or even breaking a hip. Now, you can help your Grandparents continue to enjoy their lives free from the fear of falling and hurting themselves. </p>
<p>Here’s how: Contribute money to the development of a product that will help protect seniors from injury when they fall. <br/><br/>I am Dr. Marshall Keyes, MD, a physician who has practiced medicine for over 35 years. I invented HIP-D™ (Hip Inflatable Protection Device), a stylish belt that automatically detects falls and inflates a protective personal-size airbag around the hips, well before the wearer hits the ground. This all takes place within a fraction of a second, faster than the blink an eye. The airbag, just like the one in your car (but much smaller and attractive) cushions the fall and reduces the force of impact against the ground. At the same time, a built in mini-cell phone connects the wearer to an emergency call center operator. <br/><br/>Falls and hip fractures are a huge epidemic. Every year, there are thirty million falls, resulting in 60,000 deaths in the US alone. The size of the problem is evident in the following facts*:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 million falls a year in the US alone</li>
<li>33% of seniors (1 out of 3) fall at least once a year</li>
<li>350,000 hip fractures a year from falls</li>
<li>60,000 deaths a year from hip fracture complications</li>
<li>20,000 seniors die of each year from falls alone</li>
<li>80% of women over age 75 would rather die than fracture their hip and be admitted to a nursing home (British Medical Journal).</li>
</ul>
<p>*CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention), a branch of the Dept. of Health and Human Services of the US government, and respected medical journals </p>
<p>There has been no solution to this problem, until now. With your help, we can solve this epidemic.</p>
<p>HIP-D™ uses state-of-the-art technology including personal-size airbags, motion sensors (accelerometers), cell phones and GPS location systems. In addition to the elderly, HIP-D can also help protect anyone prone to falls, including the injured, disabled, handicapped and post-op patients.</p>
<p>Development for HIP-D™ has been performed by researchers, scientists and engineers at USC Dept. of Engineering in Los Angeles, the Palo Alto VA Rehabilitation R&amp;D Center, the Motion Analysis Laboratory of the Neurology Department of Tel Aviv Sourosky Medical Center/Ichilov Hospital and independent engineers in the US, Israel and China. </p>
<p>As a physician, I have spent most of my adult life caring for people. I fell in love with medicine as an undergraduate at Princeton and continued my studies at Temple Medical School. Throughout my career, I have had thousands of seniors as patients, many of whom have fallen or live in constant fear of falling and breaking their hips. Now, HIP-D can make a unique contribution to the well-being of millions of seniors.</p>
<p>Your support can help me complete the development of this revolutionary product. A commercially available HIP-D™ will help protect seniors, improve their quality of life, and maybe even help save your own Grandma from serious injury, hip fracture or death.</p>
<h3>Who We Are </h3>
<p>Marshall Keyes, MD: physician and inventor who wants to improve the lives of seniors and protect them from fall related injuries.</p>
<p>Steve Finkel, Engineer: an experienced engineer who has managed product development for major international technology companies.</p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>To finish product development, perform clinical testing, set-up for production and prepare to market and sell our product, we need $475,000.</p>
<p>You contributions will support the following activities: completion of product development, clinical trials, production line set-up and tooling for manufacturing, creation of sales and marketing campaign and miscellaneous expenses including rent, travel, legal fees, computers and insurance.</p>

<p><strong>What is this campaign for?</strong></p>
<p>Entrapenuers, artists,and self starters have all experienced road blocks one way or another in their careers because of money and lack of funding.</p>
<p>At this current stage we are two emerging fashion designers who are absolutly passionate about art and fashion, after two  successfull years in chicago demand for our designs grew, but lack of proper work space and resources have been limiting our potential to expand. So after carefull consideration we decided to take a risk and get our own design studio (chicago fashion factory) begening june 2012.</p>
<p>Our plan is to also create unique workshops in the studio, teaching rare fashion design techniques , fashion marketing , fashion show production, and much more. As our workshops progress we aim to give back to the community by creating donated workshops to teach young artists who are interested in fashion design yet lack the opprotunity to learn the proper fundamentals to exceed.</p>
<p>With your help so much is possible, funding proper tools and supplies that are needed in the professional design environment , this will give us the opprotunity not to only move forward as designers but also have the ability to help other artists/designers with knowledge and experience to move forward with their careers, a trickle effect with so much potential.</p>

<p>The idea of Kasy was initiated when Katrín, the founder
and the designer was on her summer vacation in Spain several years ago. She had
always found it difficult to find the right swimwear that fulfilled her needs
and desire. The usual outfit for her on the beach was a whole swim dress that
she was comfortable enough wearing when playing with her son. On the other hand
when there was time to relax and catch some sun, she needed to go privet to
change into a bikini. At this time Katrín got the idea of designing a
multifunctional swimwear that would fulfill her needs.<br/></p>
<p>Katrín started working on the idea of Kasy swimwear after she lost her job prior to the economic crisis. That pushed her
to follow her dream and act on this brilliant idea of a multifunctional swimwear

<p>Kasy needs your support to be able to continue our hard work. We have pretty much set everything up, the design, the colors and a solid manufacturer. We even were able to build up strong contacts with international retailers last year. What we need the most at this time is a financial support to be able to manufacture more styles and colors. As well as build up a strong international marketing campaign. The women who have tried Kasy swimwear are all happy with the product and some claim that Kasy has changed their lives. We do believe we have a good product and a great opportunity on the market. Your support means a great deal for us and will allow us to reach our goal.<br/></p>

<p><b>Does the bikini bra have a plate?
</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span> 
No the bra has no plate nor is padded. For our next line we're adding a plate on the side for extra support. </p>
<p><b>Can I switch the position of the straps on the back of the bikini bra?
</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>
Yes, you can actually have them three ways: either fastened normally (vertically), across the shoulders or tied at the back of your neck for a halter neck look. We recommend having them across the shoulders for maximum support. </p>
<p><b>Since the bikini bra is in one piece, is it hard to put on?
</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>
For some women it can be a bit difficult, similar to putting on a sports bra. In the near future we´ll alter the design of the bikini bra and add regular bra hooks to make it easier to put on. </p>
<p><b> The fabric in most of my swimwear gets a bit see-through after a while, especially at the back of my bikini bottoms. Will that happen to my Kasy swimwear?
</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>
No, Kasy swimwear definitely shouldn't become see-through. Just in case, we made our bottoms out of extra thick fabric because we’d like our customers to be able to bend over and adjust their towels on the sun bench without feeling uncomfortable. </p>
<p><b>Will you add more colors?
</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>
Yes we will! Our goal is to always have our 8 main colors available so you can add your favorite color piece to your Kasy collection at any time. We´ll have 2-3 new and trending colors every year, but to top it off, each year a carefully selected artist will design a fabulous new print for us. For every sold print piece from the Kasy swimwear line, a donation will be made to a charity of the artists choosing. </p>
<p><b>Will the snaps withstand chlorine and sea water?
</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>
Yes, they will. Just in case, we recommend that you soak your Kasy swimwear in cold water for about 30 minutes after use. We also recommend you watch our video that shows the best way to take care of your Kasy swimwear. </p>
<p><b>Do the snaps get very hot in the sun?
</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>
In the three years we've sold Kasy swimwear we haven't had any problems with people hurting themselves on hot snaps. They can of course get quite hot if you lay your swimwear in the sun with the snaps exposed, so be careful just in case. </p>
<p><b>What if I already have a few Kasy pieces and get pregnant? </b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>Can I still use it?

You sure can. When your baby bump gets bigger you might need a bigger middle piece (like a swim dress) to snap on to your bikini bra, but you should still be able to use your bikini bra and bottoms. You could use the opportunity to get a middle piece in a print or a new color to mix it up.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>I entered my address incorrectly. Can I change it?
</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>
Yes you can. Please email to kasy@kasyswim.com with subject title: ‘Address Change’. Thank you.<br/><br/></p>

In the three years we've sold Kasy swimwear we haven't had any problems with people hurting themselves on hot snaps. They can of course get quite hot if you lay your swimwear in the sun with the snaps exposed, so be careful just in case. 
What if I already have a few Kasy pieces and get pregnant? Can I still use it?

You sure can. When your baby bump gets bigger you might need a bigger middle piece (like a swim dress) to snap on to your bikini bra, but you should still be able to use your bikini bra and bottoms. You could use the opportunity to get a middle piece in a print or a new color to mix it up. 
I entered my address incorrectly. Can I change it?

Yes you can. Please email to kasy@kasyswim.com with subject title: ‘Address Change’. Thank you.",38.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>the idea</h3>
<p>To start a bridal shop that focuses on the more<strong> alternative brides</strong>, specializing in <strong>vintage, vintage inspired, and other offbeat styles</strong>. I want it to be a creative space where any kind of bride can find their look. Not just dresses, but jumpsuits, separates, capes, veils, headpieces, and shoes and other accessories. The goal is to make it a comfortable environment for <strong>brides to express themselves</strong> without having to settle or conform.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>your help</h3>
<p>Eventually I would love to open my own storefront, but for now my plan is to get started with a rental space at one of the <strong>local vintage stores</strong>. Usually those vendors just display their merchandise and then leave it up to the store runners, but I want to make mine as personal as possible. In addition to having the dresses on display, I want to make the space feel like an actual<strong> tiny bridal shop within the store</strong>. I'll be leaving business cards/contact information in the space for brides to make <strong>special requests</strong> on inventory or to have the option to <strong>buy online</strong>. Depending on what the store allows, I would also like to give the brides the opportunity to have me <strong>help them with styling</strong>--almost like a real bridal appointment. </p>
<p>The funds I receive to get started will go mainly towards <strong>inventory</strong>, as well as <strong>retail and marketing supplies</strong> (hangers, body forms, displays, business cards, etc.) and <strong>some decor </strong>items to make it feel like a nice little bridal shop.</p>

<p>I have always been creative, and my only consistent occupational goal has been to <strong>live a creative life</strong>. When I was younger I was very into fashion design. Interest in fashion has stayed with me, but my career goal changed to graphic design around high school-age. I went to school briefly for graphic design after taking many classes of that sort in high school, however, I got discouraged and reconsidered my interest in making that a career. </p>
<p>Of course, on the side I've had lots of other interests and passions for different types of creative projects--everything from event planning, to flipping furniture, to makeup. When I started working as a stylist in a bridal shop, I realized that this is what I get excited about. <strong>I get to be creative with fashion and styling, while also helping people and making them happy</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm not a very traditional bride (though I love ALL types of brides!!) I enjoy the more <strong>unique looks</strong>.

 but no online sales. In the summer I had some success selling at street fairs and flea markets, however since the weather is colder now, there are almost no fairs for me to sell at.
I am trying to raise $100 to join the Woodbridge 
Artisan Guild in order to have a retail space to sell my Jewelry. I think The Woodbridge Artisan Guild
 and Gallery would be a great opportunity for my Jewelry business. The 
Gallery is located on Main Street in Downtown Woodbridge, NJ and his a high traffic area.
With a portion of the remaining funds I plan to purchase jewelry displays (which are very expensive). I can then try to sell my jewelry to bars, liquor stores, and other retail spaces. I would be able to use $300 to purchase 10 earring displays, 10 bracelet displays, 10 ring displays, and about 500 display cards/packaging.
I would like $100 to use for my transportation expenses and marketing (business cards/flyers) related to sales meetings.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

When this moment arrives in our life, we realize it is almost impossible for us to find it because of the budget. Some models were really nice, but way too expensive. This moment changed our life because it brings us an idea. This idea is why we created our own brand: GRIFFIN EMBLEM - a stylish and high quality automatic watch at an affordable price.

<p align=""justify"">All the GRIFFIN EMBLEM watches use the Japanese MIYOTA 82S series of mechanical automatic movements with exquisite workmanship and are held to high-quality standards. Both the material selection and assembling technicians have a good reputation. The 82S series, which was selected by GRIFFIN EMBLEM, was one of its masterpieces. The fantastic hollowed out and naked pendulum design combines with intricate carvings and show the manufacturing process - this makes the series’ movements look both beautiful and perfect.</p>

<p align=""justify"">All GRIFFIN EMBLEM watches are made of 316L stainless steel. 316L is a kind of steel that comes from the United States. It is the standard steel number of the ¨ASTM: American Society for Testing and Material.〃 Its corrosion resistance is very strong and the texture of it is pretty good as well. L means low carbon. It will have little impact on human skin and it is the only option for an advanced watch. The designers of GRIFFIN EMBLEM treat watches as artwork, and in addition we choose sophisticated Japanese mechanical movement. We also focus on the process of polishing; its advanced technology of frosting and polishing makes the polish and texture of the watch fine and clear, and from there a strong three-dimensional appearance is formed.</p>

Quelque chose de chic qui va durer plus d'un mois et qui ne traînera pas dans le bocal situé dans votre entrée. Lorsque ce moment est arrivé dans notre vie, nous avons réalisé qu'il était presque impossible pour nous de trouver une montre automatique à cause de notre budget. Ce moment a changé notre vie parce que cela nous a apporter une idée. Cette idée a été de créer notre propre marque, GRIFFIN EMBLEM, une montre élégante et luxueuse, mais à un prix abordable ! Nous avons passé des mois à travailler sur les détails et sur la conception pour essayer d'apporter les meilleurs matériaux associés à beau design, combinés dans une même montre. Ce qu'il nous manque ? Les fonds pour démarrer la production. Nous voulons que cette idée puisse se réaliser grâce à vous, ici sur Indiegogo.</span><span> </span> </p></div>

<div style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif !important;font-size: 16px !important;line-height: 26px !important;""><p align=""justify"">Toutes les montres GRIFFIN EMBLEM utilisent la série japonaise Miyota 82S de mouvements mécaniques automatiques, une exécution exquise et supervisée par des normes de haute qualité. Ce mouvement dispose d'une très bonne réputation, à la fois sur le choix des matériaux mais aussi sur les techniciens d'assemblage. La série 82S est l'une des plus belles oeuvres de Miyota (Citizen). La conception de pendule nu et libre, se combinent avec des sculptures complexes. La présence de joyaux expose de façon élégante son processus de fabrication. Cet ensemble donne des mouvements superbes, et parfaits. Les modèles RG-1001 à RG-1005 possèdent le mouvement 82S0 tandis que le modèle RG-1006 est équipé du 85S5.<span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><b style=""font-weight: bold;background-color: initial;""> </b></p></div>

<p align=""justify"">Toutes les montres GRIFFIN EMBLEM sont faites d'acier inoxydable 316L. 316L est une référence destinée à l'acier aux État-Unis.

Il aura donc peu d'impact sur la peau humaine et il est la seule option disponible pour les montres complexes. Les designers de GRIFFIN EMBLEM  considèrent les montres comme des oeuvres d'art, en plus de choisir un mouvement mécanique japonais sophistiqué, ils mettent également l'accent sur le processus du vernissage, sur sa technologie de pointe de givre et de polissage, ce qui rend la texture de la vitre de la montre claire, qui lui permet un fort aspect tridimensionnel.</p>

Before presenting the campaign and our watches, we would like to thank all of you for being on this page and we hope you will love the project and would like to be part of this wonderful journey. 
 

 

The GRIFFIN EMBLEM is more about the treasure than the griffin. We love the fact that griffin were perceived as heroes, but also as protectors of gold. On the logo, you can see the griffin is touching a diamond. This diamond is a reference to the treasure Griffins were fighting for. The word “emblem” is more a reference to the treasure than a synonym of ""logo.""
 
 
 
　
 

There is always one moment in your life that you decide to buy a high quality automatic watch that will last you more than a year. When this moment arrives in our life, we realize it is almost impossible for us to find it because of the budget. Some models were really nice, but way too expensive. This moment changed our life because it brings us an idea. This idea is why we created our own brand: GRIFFIN EMBLEM - a stylish and high quality automatic watch at an affordable price. We spent months working on details and on the design trying to bring the best materials and design to a single watch.






 


The brand concept of GRIFFIN EMBLEM insists on the principle of little quantity and high quality. We create a series of valuable limited edition mechanical watches by careful design, superior selection and artistic polish. We’ve worked very hard on this brand, and we want to be sure that you can have a watch that has :


An automatic movement
The best quality materials
A design that allows you to wear the watch in casual or professional clothes
The best affordable price for a watch of this quality
A beautiful watch without a battery (save the planet, say no to batteries)


 
We have five models, and each model divided into two colors. Each color will be limited in 45 pieces, for a total of 450 pieces.



 












 All the models are SOLD OUT. THANK YOU

All the GRIFFIN EMBLEM watches use the Japanese MIYOTA 82S series of mechanical automatic movements with exquisite workmanship and are held to high-quality standards. Both the material selection and assembling technicians have a good reputation. The 82S series, which was selected by GRIFFIN EMBLEM, was one of its masterpieces. The fantastic hollowed out and naked pendulum design combines with intricate carvings and show the manufacturing process - this makes the series’ movements look both beautiful and perfect.
　


　


All GRIFFIN EMBLEM watches are made of 316L stainless steel. 316L is a kind of steel that comes from the United States. It is the standard steel number of the ¨ASTM: American Society for Testing and Material.〃 Its corrosion resistance is very strong and the texture of it is pretty good as well. L means low carbon. It will have little impact on human skin and it is the only option for an advanced watch. The designers of GRIFFIN EMBLEM treat watches as artwork, and in addition we choose sophisticated Japanese mechanical movement. We also focus on the process of polishing; its advanced technology of frosting and polishing makes the polish and texture of the watch fine and clear, and from there a strong three-dimensional appearance is formed.
Each of GRIFFIN EMBLEM watch is equipped with an advanced leather strap, allowing you to not only appreciate its intricate craft, but also enjoy the comfortable feeling.




 
 

 
 


How will the funds be used ?
 

The funds we will receive will be used for following all processes during the production of the watches, creating new prototypes and doing all the tests that are able to give you the best experience. Any additional funds will be used to give you new product (all contributors will have a metal plate on the packaging thanks to the goal of 10,000€), create a new collection and recruit new members to our team to enable us to accelerate the delivery time and also create new collections if we raise enough.

  Nous sommes fiers de vous présenter nos montres automatiques GRIFFIN EMBLEM. 5 Modèles, 2 couleurs par modèle, chaque couleur est limitée à 45 pièces.   Plus qu'une montre, une oeuvre d'art.   


 




 



 


Avant de présenter notre campagne et nos montres, nous souhaitons vous remercier d'être présent sur cette page et nous espérons que vous aimerez le projet, et que vous souhaiterez faire parti de cette aventure ! 
 
 
 
 


Il y a toujours un moment dans votre vie où vous décidez d'acheter un objet de qualité, dans notre cas, une vraie montre. Quelque chose de chic qui va durer plus d'un mois et qui ne traînera pas dans le bocal situé dans votre entrée. Lorsque ce moment est arrivé dans notre vie, nous avons réalisé qu'il était presque impossible pour nous de trouver une montre automatique à cause de notre budget. Ce moment a changé notre vie parce que cela nous a apporter une idée. Cette idée a été de créer notre propre marque, GRIFFIN EMBLEM, une montre élégante et luxueuse, mais à un prix abordable ! Nous avons passé des mois à travailler sur les détails et sur la conception pour essayer d'apporter les meilleurs matériaux associés à beau design, combinés dans une même montre. Ce qu'il nous manque ? Les fonds pour démarrer la production. Nous voulons que cette idée puisse se réaliser grâce à vous, ici sur Indiegogo.  

　

Le concept de la marque de GRIFFIN EMBLEM est basé sur des produits limités en quantités mais de très bonne qualité. Nous avons pu créer une série de montres mécaniques, avec une conception soignée et une sélection de matériaux supérieurs. Nous avons travaillé très dur sur cette marque, et nous voulons être sûrs qu'en achetant notre produit, vous aurez une montre qui possède:



Un mouvement automatique
Les meilleurs matériaux de qualité
Un design qui vous permet de porter la montre avec des vêtements décontractés ou professionnels
Le meilleur prix sur le marché pour cette gamme de montres
Une belle montre sans batterie

Nous avons 5 modèles, chaque modèle divisé en 2 couleurs, chaque couleur sera limitée à 45 pièces, pour un total de 450 pièces.   

Les modèles 1002-1, 1002-2, 1003-1, 1003-2, 1005-1, 1005-2,  1006-1 et 1006-2 sont en rupture de stock, et ne seront pas renouvelés (Ce sont des éditions limitées).  

 
LES PHOTOS : 
 



Rendez-vous plus haut dans la partie en anglais, ou Cliquez sur l'onglet Galerie situé en haut de la page, en dessous du titre du projet, pour voir de nombreuses photos des montres.
　
Le mouvement : 

Toutes les montres GRIFFIN EMBLEM utilisent la série japonaise Miyota 82S de mouvements mécaniques automatiques, une exécution exquise et supervisée par des normes de haute qualité. Ce mouvement dispose d'une très bonne réputation, à la fois sur le choix des matériaux mais aussi sur les techniciens d'assemblage. La série 82S est l'une des plus belles oeuvres de Miyota (Citizen). La conception de pendule nu et libre, se combinent avec des sculptures complexes. La présence de joyaux expose de façon élégante son processus de fabrication. Cet ensemble donne des mouvements superbes, et parfaits. Les modèles RG-1001 à RG-1005 possèdent le mouvement 82S0 tandis que le modèle RG-1006 est équipé du 85S5.  

L'acier : 
Toutes les montres GRIFFIN EMBLEM sont faites d'acier inoxydable 316L. 316L est une référence destinée à l'acier aux État-Unis. La référence 316 provient de la société ""ASTM, American Society for Testing and Material"". Sa capacité de résistance à la corrosion est très forte et la texture de celui-ci est aussi très bonne. L signifie Low carbon. Il aura donc peu d'impact sur la peau humaine et il est la seule option disponible pour les montres complexes. Les designers de GRIFFIN EMBLEM  considèrent les montres comme des oeuvres d'art, en plus de choisir un mouvement mécanique japonais sophistiqué, ils mettent également l'accent sur le processus du vernissage, sur sa technologie de pointe de givre et de polissage, ce qui rend la texture de la vitre de la montre claire, qui lui permet un fort aspect tridimensionnel.

Le cuir : 
Chacune des montres GRIFFIN EMBLEM est equipée d'un bracelet en cuir de qualité, ce qui vous permet non seulement d'apprécier son artisanat complexe, mais aussi de profiter de la sensation de confort de celui-ci.

Comment les fonds récoltés seront-ils utilisés?

Les fonds que nous recevrons seront utilisés pour le démarrage de la production, également pour tout le processus au cours de la production de montres, la création de nouveaux prototypes et la mise en place de tous les tests pour être en mesure de vous donner la meilleure expérience. Les fonds supplémentaires seront utilisés pour contribuer à la production, mais également pour vous donner de nouveaux produits (nouveaux bracelets en cuir par exemple), et recruter de nouveaux membres dans notre équipe pour être en mesure d'accélérer les délais de livraison.

<h2><strong>Update #2 - July 19<br/></strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Update #1 - July 12<br/></strong></h2>
<p><strong>We are excited to see the great interest and feedback from some fans.  Here is a short video to keep you up to date:<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://changingeyewear.com/news/sun-cvs-have-a-pretty-bright-future/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://changingeyewear.com/news/sun-cvs-have-a-pretty-bright-future/</a> <br/></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Changing Eyewear™<sup><br/></sup></strong></h2>
<p>Greetings Indiegogos!  We are very pleased to début our first generation of glasses, renamed CVs<sup>TM</sup>.  The unique design of CVs helps to solve the age old question “where did I put my glasses?” </p>
<p>When not in use, CVs collapse to the perfect size with very little effort.  Unlike traditional glasses, CVs’ sides gently rest on the temple versus over the ear. </p>
<p>This design is TempleRest<sup>TM</sup> technology that is manufactured from a special memory polymer.  The goal of the TempleRest is to promote comfort and provide the stability to keep CVs in place.  Combine the TempleRests with a specially designed hinge in the bridge of the CVs and they fold into a practical size when not in use.</p>
<p><img alt=""Reader CVs and Sun CVs"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://changingeyewear.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/slider-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>By connecting the CVs to a retractable reel, which can clip to your shirt pocket, collar, ID lanyard, or inside pocket of your jacket, the age old question and frustration becomes a thing of the past.  The reel is attached by a simple snap and can be removed as needed.  A “retract” button on the reel holds them close at hand when you are not wearing them. </p>
<p>If you don’t want to use the reel, we have a great custom designed carrying case that clips to your belt. </p>
<p>The initial release of CVs will include three very stylish frame styles in three colors and lenses ranging in strength from 1.0 to 2.5.</p>
<p>Our founder Robert Rochford, is a 28 year veteran of the United States Navy and designed CVs out of a need to resolve the frustration associated with making reading glasses more convenient.  What we are presenting to you was born out of frustration and will revolutionize not only how you wear eyewear, but how you carry them with you.</p>
<p><img alt=""http://changingeyewear.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/benjamin-franklin-220.jpg"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://changingeyewear.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/benjamin-franklin-220.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 6px 9px;""/></p>
<p>Look at the glasses that Ben Franklin wore.  Do they look familiar?  He invented bifocals over 200 years ago and yet the basic design of glasses themselves is still the same!  To solve this problem elegantly, I knew that we needed to reinvent glasses altogether.</p>
<p>Our company has completed the prototyping and now seeks support through crowdfunding.  When we reach our 100% funding goal, we will deliberately march from prototyping to full rate production.  The needed funds will support the high quality injection molds to produce the anticipated volume needed and manufacturing infrastructure to help us succeed right out of the gate.  We decided to start with Reader CVs, but with great excitement plan to have Sun CVs that have no prescription and are for everybody out before Christmas.</p>
<p><img alt=""Reader CVs and Sun CVs"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://changingeyewear.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/slider-2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>WHY CVs?</strong></h2>
<p>Most people who use reading glasses reached a point in their lives, normally around the age of 40, where their ability to read newspapers, books, or a computer screen becomes hampered as their eyes can’t focus up close anymore.  However, because reading glasses are not normally worn all of the time, there is a moment of frustration when you find yourself somewhere where your glasses are not. </p>

<p>CVI’s challenge was to combine the usefulness of glasses with the convenience of having them with you when you need them.  The driving force behind their design was based on the aggravation of them not being handy.  Most who wear reading glass try not to remember how many times they left the house without their glasses only to find that they can’t read the menu because the font is too small or at the supermarket struggling to read a label.  Or how about just trying to read or send a text message from their cell phone.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>GLASSES REDESIGNED!</strong></h2>
<p>The challenges that faced our engineers were to overcome two obstacles.  First, how do you keep CVs with you without wearing them around your neck on a chain while still keep them close at hand?  The second issue that needed to be addressed; the size of traditional glasses don’t collapse into a convenient space.  The arms that stick over your ears and the face of glasses don’t fold.  Not to mention that traditional glasses sitting on your ears hour after hour can be bothersome. </p>
<p>The most common solution today is folding eyeglasses.  They have numerous folding mechanisms to open and close them, tend to be flimsy, are bulky enough that it’s difficult for you to keep them with you, and still sit on your ears. </p>
<p>Folding the glasses was indeed part of the solution, but we needed to challenge the basic paradigm of how glasses are designed and worn today.  The result is the new glasses would need to effortlessly collapse and be “at the ready” when you didn’t need them; and they would be with you when you did need them.  We have heard so many times, “I hate to have to walk across the room, up the stairs, out to the car, or borrow someone else’s glasses from the next table over just to read something!”</p>
<p>The size of CVs, when closed, was key to the overall design and in particular,<br/> how the sides were designed.  But size was not the only consideration.  Stability of the CVs when worn is in large part due to the technical design and the dimensions of the TempleRest.  The gentle spring action of its memory polymer provides just enough pressure to gently hold them in place.  When you combine the stability of the TempleRest with the specially designed hinge in the bridge, the whole thing collapses with very little help.</p>

<h2><strong>KEEPING THEM HANDY!</strong></h2>
<p>The final element to solve the “convenience conundrum” is the retractable reel.  The reel attaches to the side of the TempleRest by use of a simple <img alt=""Engineering Drawing Fig 3"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://changingeyewear.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Reel-engineering-drawing.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Engineering Drawing Fig 3""/>snap, which can be removed as needed.  On the back of the reel is a pressure clamp that slides onto just about anything you’re wearing.  When the user pulls the CVs away from the reel, the nylon cord remains out until the “retract” button is pushed.  When not needed the reel holds the CVs in place.  If the wearer doesn’t want to use the<img alt=""CV Holster"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://changingeyewear.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/CV-Holster.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 6px 9px;"" title=""CV Holster""/> reel, they can easily be stored in their custom designed carrying case that clips to your belt.  Additionally, our engineers are in the process of redesigning the reel to offer additional attachment options and to improve the overall aesthetics.  We expect this to be out sometime early next year.</p>

We are excited to see the great interest and feedback from some fans.  Here is a short video to keep you up to date:

Changing Eyewear™
Greetings Indiegogos!  We are very pleased to début our first generation of glasses, renamed CVsTM.  The unique design of CVs helps to solve the age old question “where did I put my glasses?” 
When not in use, CVs collapse to the perfect size with very little effort.  Unlike traditional glasses, CVs’ sides gently rest on the temple versus over the ear. 
This design is TempleRestTM technology that is manufactured from a special memory polymer.  The goal of the TempleRest is to promote comfort and provide the stability to keep CVs in place.  Combine the TempleRests with a specially designed hinge in the bridge of the CVs and they fold into a practical size when not in use.

By connecting the CVs to a retractable reel, which can clip to your shirt pocket, collar, ID lanyard, or inside pocket of your jacket, the age old question and frustration becomes a thing of the past.  The reel is attached by a simple snap and can be removed as needed.  A “retract” button on the reel holds them close at hand when you are not wearing them. 
If you don’t want to use the reel, we have a great custom designed carrying case that clips to your belt. 
The initial release of CVs will include three very stylish frame styles in three colors and lenses ranging in strength from 1.0 to 2.5.
Our founder Robert Rochford, is a 28 year veteran of the United States Navy and designed CVs out of a need to resolve the frustration associated with making reading glasses more convenient.  What we are presenting to you was born out of frustration and will revolutionize not only how you wear eyewear, but how you carry them with you.

Look at the glasses that Ben Franklin wore.  Do they look familiar?  He invented bifocals over 200 years ago and yet the basic design of glasses themselves is still the same!  To solve this problem elegantly, I knew that we needed to reinvent glasses altogether.
Our company has completed the prototyping and now seeks support through crowdfunding.  When we reach our 100% funding goal, we will deliberately march from prototyping to full rate production.  The needed funds will support the high quality injection molds to produce the anticipated volume needed and manufacturing infrastructure to help us succeed right out of the gate.  We decided to start with Reader CVs, but with great excitement plan to have Sun CVs that have no prescription and are for everybody out before Christmas.

WHY CVs?
Most people who use reading glasses reached a point in their lives, normally around the age of 40, where their ability to read newspapers, books, or a computer screen becomes hampered as their eyes can’t focus up close anymore.  However, because reading glasses are not normally worn all of the time, there is a moment of frustration when you find yourself somewhere where your glasses are not. 

CVI’s challenge was to combine the usefulness of glasses with the convenience of having them with you when you need them.  The driving force behind their design was based on the aggravation of them not being handy.  Most who wear reading glass try not to remember how many times they left the house without their glasses only to find that they can’t read the menu because the font is too small or at the supermarket struggling to read a label.  Or how about just trying to read or send a text message from their cell phone.

FAQ
Q.  What are the details of the $1650 pledge level?  A.  This pledge level promises to be a blast!  There is no minimum number of pledgers for this level but there is a maximum of 75, so better hurry.  We will have the kickoff celebration with as many pledgers that sign up.  The flight must originate in the continental U.S. (48 States).  International pledgers will be reimbursed a maximum of $400 for the flight.  Transportation to the nearest major airport and parking are not included.  Flight cost is for the pledger only.  Transportation costs if you wish to bring a guest or your family are not included.  Shuttle from Orlando airport to the hotel is covered for everyone.  All flights will be estimated using Kayak.com plus 10%.  A voucher will be sent to the pledger to pay for the flight.  All reservations are the responsibility of the pledger.  If you live a reasonable distance (~175 miles) from Orlando, you are expected to drive and we will provide a voucher for gas reimbursement (estimated).  Hotel room will be booked based on single or double occupancy.  Any additional costs associated with the hotel room are the responsibility of the pledger.  The hotel room cost is for Saturday night (kickoff celebration) only.  If the pledger wishes to arrive early and/or stay late, Disney has offered a special room rate for up to three days before Saturday and three days after Saturday including special discounts on park passes.  Cost for the room before or after Saturday is the responsibility of the pledger.  Kickoff celebration is for the pledger and one guest.
Q.  What are the details of the $60 Sun CV pledge level?  A.  This is also a great pledge level that will help us choose the frame styles for our debut of Sun CVs.  Sun CVs don’t have any prescription and are designed for everybody!  BONUS:  We will randomly select one pledger from this level to join us for the CV kickoff celebration and to meet the CV Team!  We’ll fly you to Orlando and put you up in a luxury hotel at Disney.  There must be a minimum of 40 of the 75 pledgers at the $1650 level.  The selection for the pledger to join us in Orlando will be videotaped and available for viewing by link from our website and on YouTube.  The same restrictions that apply for the $1650 pledge level also apply at this level for the one selected to join us in Orlando.
Q.  Will they stay put on my face?  A.  Absolutely!  TempleRest technology ensures a comfortable and stable fit.  TempleRest is manufactured out of a special memory polymer that gently rests on your temple and provides the stability to keep the CVs in place.  The benefit of the TempleRest™ design is the elimination of those long arms that sit on your ears and don’t conveniently collapse.  
Q.  Will they hurt my temples?  A.  No.  Under normal circumstances, CVs with TempleRest technology will gently rest on the temples and are comfortable for all day wear.  
Q.  How does the reel attached to my clothing?  A.  The reel has a pressure clip (like one you would attach to a pocket) that will securely hold the CVs in place when not in use.  The clip will also hold the reel securely while you are wearing the CVs.  Our engineers are in the process of redesigning the reel to offer several options to secure the CVs.  More to follow on that…
Q.  Are the Sun CVs for everyone?  A.  Absolutely!  Sun CVs do not have any prescription or lens magnification at all.  Sun CVs are intended to provide a new and exciting look for eyewear wore outside.  These will probably become the coolest thing out there.
Q.  Are the lenses scratch proof?  A.  Yes!  The lenses are made from a hard and durable plastic (polycarbonate) and should be able to withstand normal day to day use.  Like any pair of conventional glasses, over time and if misused, the lenses can become damaged.  If the lenses are damaged, we recommend replacing them immediately.
Q.  Do the lenses provide UV protection?  A.  Yes!  CVs lenses are provide protection from UVA and UVB.  Although the protection is not the same as wearing sunglasses, CVI recommends wearing Sun CVs when outdoors (see how we did that).
Q.  Do CVs come in any other frame designs or offer any additional lens options?  A.  Remember this is a revolution, we will need some additional time to take over the world.  We are already working on adding exciting designs and colors as well as additional options on lenses.  We hope to release CVs 2.0 during the fall of 2013 and early in 2014.  Buying the current versions of CVs will help us cover the expense of expanding the CV line of products… more to follow.
Q.  Is the founder, Bob Rochford, still on active duty?  A.  Yes.  Bob is intimately involved with every aspect of business development and continues to serve the U.S. Navy as a Captain on active duty.  The CVI staff keeps him informed of all day to day operations and we wait for him to join us full time when he retires soon from the Navy.
Q.  Do CVs come with the carrying case?  A.  No.  Unfortunately, we are not able to offer the carrying case as part of the Indiegogo pledge levels.  You can visit our website at www.ChangingEyewear.com to order a carrying case for your CVs.  Details are offered on the website.  The carrying case  is also very cool.
Q.  What if I need reader lenses at a stronger strength than you are offering?  A.  Once you have signed up for a pledge level, send us an email and we will provide you additional information.  Depending on the quantity for your particular strength, a small service charge may apply.
Q.  Are CVs for everyone?  A.  CVs were designed to fit faces of all different shapes and sizes.  The gentle spring motion from the TempleRests may help fit CVs to those with a more narrow face or those with a wider structure.  CVs are not intended for children, although, we are planning on a line of CV products for younger folks.
Q.  Are there other options for attaching the reel to my clothing?  A.  Not yet.  It is a priority for us.  Our engineers are in the process of redesigning the reel to offer additional attachment options and to improve the overall aesthetics.  We expect this to be out sometime later this year.

<p>Modibodi is stylish underwear designed to resist sweat, stains and leaks. Modibodi is putting the function back into fashion and giving women a more eco-friendly way to manage their light bladder leaks, plus provide them with some extra security to help out on those tricky days eg. periods, hot days, working out.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The underwear uses both high performance fabrics that prevent perspiration odour and keep you dry. The underpants include our patent pending super slim (.3mm), super absorbent (over 5ml), stain resistant liner. We called it 'Modifier Technology' and the liners works to wick, absorb and evaporate moisture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Modibodi are not bulky, and to wear they are almost similar to regular underwear but with plenty more benefits.</p>
<p>Modibodi is great for - menstruation, pregnancy, mums, menopause, active women and hot days, or for those who just want underwear you can wear from morning to night no worries.</p>

<p><u>Moisture is a common problem</u></p>
<p>As a mother and active person I owned plenty of pairs of cotton and synthetic underwear, but after one too many 'oh no' moments I came to the realisation that my underwear, while it was pretty, was failing me. The thought of wearing uncomfortable and environmentally damaging disposable liners did not seem right and had quite a negative impact on my ego.

<p>What I found out?</p>
<p>- 1 in 8 young women have urinary leaks</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have currently invested some of my own personal funds to get a small product range out onto the market. I am working really hard to find stockists, get media coverage and sell the range at markets.</p>
<p>But to really take this further I need some funding for my marketing and advertising efforts. I would love to market these on bathroom panels in shopping centres, to develop a slick video, better photography, and of course to buy more stock (fabric, care labels, swing tags, packaging and cut and sew). </p>
<p>Basically I would use half of these funds for marketing and the other half for stock.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution means alot to me. I believe there should be more to clothing than fashion and that we should constantly seek to find more eco-friendly solutions than the options that surround us. Modibodi does both. It provides women with a stylish solution that has great functionality while at the same time removing the need for the environmentally damaging and uncomfortable disposable liner.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">It is important to remember that 1 in 8 young women have urinary leaks, 1 in 3 women who have been through childbirth experience urinary leaks, most women have experienced period leaks and perspiring.

<p>EITHER/OR will carry a small collection of hand-picked clothing and accessories made my Canadian designers who value quality, comfort, style, ethical manufacturing and high environmental practices.</p>
<h2>And who am I?</h2>
<p>My name is <a href=""https://ca.linkedin.com/in/malorie-bertrand-b8888638"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Malorie Bertrand</a>.

<h3>Why am I launching an online sustainable fashion shop?</h3>
<p>I'm launching EITHER/OR to meet the growing demand for a one-stop, online shop that sells several sustainable and ethical Canadian brands under one virtual roof.</p>

It's an alternative branch of the fashion industry that operates under a triple ""p"" model: people, planet, profit. </p>
<h4>A few characteristics of sustainable and ethical fashion:</h4>
<div><ul>
<li>Uses organic textiles (grown without the use of pesticides or herbicides)</li>
<li>Uses renewable resources (hemp, bamboo)</li>
<li>Uses biodegradable materials</li>
<li>Uses recycled and recyclable materials</li>

<h3>And what if I don't reach my goal?</h3>
<p>I've chosen the flexible funding plan to make sure that your funds are still put to good use, even if I don't reach my goal. But mind over matter, I will, and you'll make it possible!</p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk for retail shops is not selling
your inventory by the end of the season. You never want to carry too much
inventory. You also don't want to run out of stock too quickly.</p>
<p>To mitigate these risks, I've built the shop on a
slow business model. I'll only be purchasing around 220 pieces for the year.
This means that if the shop can sell around ten pieces a month, it won't carry
a loss. This is a very reasonable number for me that is manageable. I'm working
full-time for at least the next two years, so I've made sure that I can handle
the operations involved in selling and shipping ten items a month.</p>
<p>If I'm left with inventory at the end of the year, I'll
sign up with Garmentory, an online shop that sells left-over stock from brick
and mortar, and online shops. Garmentory also gives me the option to bargain
with customers, making left-over stock that more appealing and affordable.</p>
<p>EITHER/OR will feature more than a handful of designers. There is always the risk of a designer or two not delivering an order on time. To mitigate this risk, I'm working with designers with whom I've had several conversations with and/or met with in person. My expectations will be made clear, and I'll be sure to put in my orders far enough in advance to give designers plenty of time to fulfill them.</p>
<p>The shop also has an advantage of being a ""slow fashion"" business. Our customers will understand that each item is hand-made, and that the designers we're working with are often one-person shops. The slower production is a positive feature of the clothing, indicating that it is ethically made and to high standards.<br/></p><h3>Other ways you can help
</h3><p>I know that not everyone can donate money to this campaign, but helping me by promoting it is just as helpful. Please share this campaign link with your friends and network via email and social media. The
more people who learn about it, the better.</p>

</div></div>","What is EITHER/OR?
EITHER/OR is an online boutique 
— launching fall 2016 
— that will sell Canadian-designed and manufactured, sustainable and ethical apparel and accessories. 
""..most of the public is still not aware that...what they're wearing could have been made in an exploitative way. We don't want to wear that story anymore. We want to see fashion become a force for good."" - Fashion Revolution white paper
EITHER/OR will carry a small collection of hand-picked clothing and accessories made my Canadian designers who value quality, comfort, style, ethical manufacturing and high environmental practices.
And who am I?
My name is Malorie Bertrand. I'm a media relations and social media professional by day, sustainable fashion blogger and stylist by night. 
Why am I launching an online sustainable fashion shop?
I'm launching EITHER/OR to meet the growing demand for a one-stop, online shop that sells several sustainable and ethical Canadian brands under one virtual roof.
We have become far too removed from our clothing, from where it is made, by whom, in what conditions and at what cost to the environment. EITHER/OR will connect people to Canadian brands that value local production, transparency and social and environmental responsibility.
What is sustainable and ethical fashion?Sustainable and ethical fashion defines clothing and accessories whose production process, from crop cultivation and dyeing, to pattern making and sewing, has a smaller environmental and social burden. It's an alternative branch of the fashion industry that operates under a triple ""p"" model: people, planet, profit. 
A few characteristics of sustainable and ethical fashion:

Uses organic textiles (grown without the use of pesticides or herbicides)
Uses renewable resources (hemp, bamboo)
Uses biodegradable materials
Uses recycled and recyclable materials
Made my garment workers who are paid a fair, livable wage; have the freedom to unionize; work in a safe environment with strict health and safety regulations; don't work overtime; have regular work breaks; receive health benefits; have paid leave; have paid sick days.
Made in garment factories that don't hire child labourers
Avoids the use of other harmful chemicals
Avoids the use of animal products or only uses animal by-products of the meat industry
Operates within a closed-loop process in which everything that is used to make a product is reused and not discarded, including the product itself.

What is the problem with mainstream fashion?
The mainstream ""fast fashion"" industry, worth an estimated $3 trillion dollars as of 2013, is the third largest industry and the second biggest polluter in the world. It directly employs more than 60 million people and likely more than double that indirectly dependent on the sector. 
Over the past decade, large fashion brands have gone from producing two collections a year, to one a week. According to the fashion documentary, The True Cost, the world now buys 80 billion new pieces of clothing and accessories a year and the average American alone generates 82 pounds of clothing annually.
The fashion industry is rampant with environmental and human abuses, and most people don't know that what they're wearing could have been made in an exploitative way. 
I know that we don't want to wear that story anymore. As the 2015 Fashion Revolution white paper says, more and more people want to see fashion become a force for good.
EITHER/OR will bridge the gap between people who demand more of the fashion industry, and the designers who are answering that call.
What is this campaign all about?

It's about helping me bring the shop to life; promoting Canada's sustainable and ethical fashion designers to a broader online audience; educating people on the benefits of shopping responsibly; and, in the grand scheme of things, strengthening support of Canada's sustainable and ethical fashion industry.

We knew there was a better way to access cash, so we achieved that purpose by introducing the Vant clipfold wallet on Kickstarter.Now we are happy to introduce the next product in our lineup. With Arc, we took all the problems seen with other wallets and nurtured them to develop the most intuitive and all-round cash, card, and coin accessible wallet to ever be created. Practical features consolidated in a sleek and modern packageClipfold Money Clip Access, manage, and store your cash in the most effortless way possible. Our money clip was designed to roughly arc at a 45 degree angle to keep your cash readily accessible for a swift and intuitive cash handling experience.While other wallets have you pinching for your cash or unraveling a quartered bill, our money clip keeps your cash flat and compliant for optimal cash management. Now revamped with an extended length and 1.5x the rigidity of previous iterations.

<p><strong>There is something special about my MJ Schiebe bag...it has become my go-to bag for when I’m packing light and on the go as a traveler – and also in my everyday life as a city dweller. The bag itself is an extra-large, over the shoulder messenger bag. The retro-style has a fun color scheme that kind of goes with everything.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I love using my MJ Schiebe bag for travel! It’s very sturdy, and roomy enough to fit a laptop, books, and other supplies. I love how the front pocket fits my iphone perfectly, so I don’t need to rummage around for my phone. Overall, MJ Schiebe bag is one of the most sturdy bags I have and it’s definitely a talking piece! </strong></p>

<h1>What makes our bags so cool?</h1>
<p>Megan Schiebe, Head Designer at M.J. Schiebe started designing these bags due to her busy work and travel schedule hopping from one country to the next for work as well as traveling to the most exotic beaches in the world to pursue her passion for surfing.  She realized that there was not a style-savvy enough bag on the market that was <strong>big enough to hold her laptop and iPad</strong> securely on the plane that <strong>looked chic</strong>, as well as could <strong>keep her cell phone and iPod in a convenient pocket</strong> with extra room to pack for a weekend getaway.  She wanted a bag that she <strong>could slide under the plane seat</strong> that was big enough to keep all of these items secure.</p>

<p><strong>Why our large travel messenger bags?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Distinctive positioning of the iPod and cellphone pocket in the front of messenger bag allows for convenient placement of keys, iPod and cellphone to facilitate easy music listening experience when traveling.</strong></p>
<p>2) <strong>Convenient zip in the center of bag in the front holds passport for effortless access.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) <strong>Upper zip pockets in front of bag provides convenient placement for flip flops, swimsuits, board shorts, sunscreen, rain-jacket, cameras, bottled water and sandwiches when traveling. </strong></strong></p>
<p>4) <strong>Large Velcro pocket pouch inside bag at the back allows for iPads and laptops to be placed while traveling and can be slipped under the plane seat. </strong></p>
<p><strong>5) <strong>Bags are padded in the front, back and sides to protect items inside bag. </strong></strong></p>

<h1>What are we doing with the funds raised? </h1>
<p>As part of our evolution as the <strong>unique travel bag for every international and exotic traveler</strong>, we are raising funds so that we can produce more bag colors. Our bags are <strong>becoming popular internationally</strong> and we have an increased demand for all of our colors to be made and we are <strong>raising $7,500</strong> to cover the initial upfront production costs.  Our bags are <strong>ideal for carrying on the plane</strong> so that you can <strong>slip them under the seat</strong> and they are large enough to pack your personal items for a weekend trip getaway. </p>

<p>In her words:</p>
<p>Ever have that experience where you’re just looking at a world globe, spin it around and then jump onto a plane to where ever your finger lands?  In a brief nutshell, that’s usually how I travel.  I’m a little feisty and love the idea of exploring and waking up every day to a new, pristine and exotic adventure.   My travels have allowed me to work, study, live and volunteer abroad, experiences I will always cherish.  I hope that when you wear one of my bags, you too will know what that feels like and carry on with your own adventure.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Who are We?

At M.J. Schiebe travel messenger bags, we support a lifestyle of excitement and exhilaration exploring new experiences; a lifestyle of music festival goers who travel internationally from one music festival to the next; the surfers and beach lovers who run across oceans to catch that next big wave; the lifestyle of a backpacker who backpacks from one hostel to the next and the lifestyle of the traveling philanthropist, who recognizes that giving back to our international communities is an important part of our principles and what we believe in.  

 
What is The Media saying about M.J. Schiebe bags?

Kate Thomas, Host of Travel show series, Travel with Kate(youtube.com/TravelwithKate)
There is something special about my MJ Schiebe bag...it has become my go-to bag for when I’m packing light and on the go as a traveler – and also in my everyday life as a city dweller. The bag itself is an extra-large, over the shoulder messenger bag. The retro-style has a fun color scheme that kind of goes with everything.
Kristen Sarah, Host of Travel Show, Hopscotch the Globe (youtube.com/hopscotchtheglobe)
Every time I bring my pink travel bag out with me, I get one compliment after the other. People really love the look of it. The bag is capable of holding a lot, and I especially like the small compartments in the front. 
Daisy Jing, Host of Your Perfect Beauty and featured in Forbes, Huffington Post, StartupAmerica, Seventeen.com (yourperfectbeauty.com)
I love using my MJ Schiebe bag for travel! It’s very sturdy, and roomy enough to fit a laptop, books, and other supplies. I love how the front pocket fits my iphone perfectly, so I don’t need to rummage around for my phone. Overall, MJ Schiebe bag is one of the most sturdy bags I have and it’s definitely a talking piece! 
 
What makes our bags so cool?
Megan Schiebe, Head Designer at M.J. Schiebe started designing these bags due to her busy work and travel schedule hopping from one country to the next for work as well as traveling to the most exotic beaches in the world to pursue her passion for surfing.  She realized that there was not a style-savvy enough bag on the market that was big enough to hold her laptop and iPad securely on the plane that looked chic, as well as could keep her cell phone and iPod in a convenient pocket with extra room to pack for a weekend getaway.  She wanted a bag that she could slide under the plane seat that was big enough to keep all of these items secure.
 


 
Why our large travel messenger bags?
1) Distinctive positioning of the iPod and cellphone pocket in the front of messenger bag allows for convenient placement of keys, iPod and cellphone to facilitate easy music listening experience when traveling.
2) Convenient zip in the center of bag in the front holds passport for effortless access.
3) Upper zip pockets in front of bag provides convenient placement for flip flops, swimsuits, board shorts, sunscreen, rain-jacket, cameras, bottled water and sandwiches when traveling. 
4) Large Velcro pocket pouch inside bag at the back allows for iPads and laptops to be placed while traveling and can be slipped under the plane seat. 
5) Bags are padded in the front, back and sides to protect items inside bag. 
 




 
What are we doing with the funds raised? 
As part of our evolution as the unique travel bag for every international and exotic traveler, we are raising funds so that we can produce more bag colors. Our bags are becoming popular internationally and we have an increased demand for all of our colors to be made and we are raising $7,500 to cover the initial upfront production costs.  Our bags are ideal for carrying on the plane so that you can slip them under the seat and they are large enough to pack your personal items for a weekend trip getaway. 
We are also big philanthropists and donate a percentage of our sales to several non-profits locally and internationally so that we can bring awareness to these causes such as Humanitarian campaigns like Women and Girl literacy projects, Human Rights, Climate Change and Breast Cancer Awareness.

It's amazing! They only saw 1 color and 1 set of images..they haven't 
even learned about customization yet and they are still hooked! Even 
more amazing, I have never showed the wristband to anyone under 25 years
 old! Imagine what could happen once these get into the hands of 
children and teenagers!</p>

read the description of our company and product. Take a moment to let it
 all sink in. Think of all the possibilities for yourself, </p>
<p>1. For Yourself: hobbies, team spirit, family, friends, interests, special occasions, weddings, holidays etc.</p>
<p>2.
 As a gift: How could you make up a wristband to reflect the interests 
and personalities of family, friends, and coworkers to make a truly 
personal and unique gift.</p>
<p>3. Businesses: Groups, promotional 
events, organizations, and giveaways. Once you start thinking about it, 
the possibilities are endless. What unique and clever ideas can you come

 old! Imagine what could happen once these get into the hands of 
children and teenagers!
     Now that you've seen our video and 
read the description of our company and product. Take a moment to let it
 all sink in. Think of all the possibilities for yourself, 
1. For Yourself: hobbies, team spirit, family, friends, interests, special occasions, weddings, holidays etc.
2.
 As a gift: How could you make up a wristband to reflect the interests 
and personalities of family, friends, and coworkers to make a truly 
personal and unique gift.
3. Businesses: Groups, promotional 
events, organizations, and giveaways. Once you start thinking about it, 
the possibilities are endless. What unique and clever ideas can you come
 up with?
   We would love to thank you in advance for your 
generous donations!  You can look forward not only to be the first in 
the world to own a Photoband, but you will have helped my son and I 
fulfill a dream that we have been dedicated to and spent countless 
amounts of time, money and energy on to develop a perfect product that 
millions will enjoy over and over again. The funds we receive will help 
us get the inventory we need and also go towards marketing. Photobands 
are fun, funky, and affordable. We like to call Photobands ""The Rolls 
Royce of Anti Bling.""",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

exquisite journey through the various fashion corners of the world? It is in
this spirit that I bring to you <b>The
Style Atlas</b>. <p>
</p><p>In this day and age the idea of “global fashion” is bandied
about readily but not really taken seriously. Sure there are entertaining  webisodes with the host imparting their
experience (and opinion), but there isn’t something that holds a bit more
gravitas. </p>
<p><i>So here I am set to shake things up. </i></p>
<b>The Style Atlas</b>
promises to be an in-depth documentary series focused on how fashion is
conceived, curated and cultivated in cities that aren’t on the traditional
fashion radar. So we diverge from the traditional fashion capitals of the world
and hone in on those who aren’t immediately recognizable but have their own
respected and developed fashion industry.<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">By interviewing local

delves deeper into the country’s vision when it comes to fashion. What are
their challenges? Strengths? How does their socio-economic, geo-political,
culture and religion play a part in completing their fashion vision? </span><br/></p><p>I have over 20+ years of
experience in the Canadian fashion publishing space, including a decade as one
of the senior editors at <i>FLARE</i> Magazine, Canada’s
national fashion magazine. Currently I have a robust portfolio as an
independent editor and journalist with media outlets including <i>The Kit South Asian Edition</i> with <i>The Toronto Star</i>, Canada’s largest city
newspaper, co-Editor-In-Chief at <i>ANOKHI
Media,</i> North America’s longest running South Asian media platform, and a
signature blogger for <i>The Huffington Post
Canada</i>. It is this experience I bring forth in my aim to create an
intelligent, and exploratory view on what creates fashion. <br/></p><p>
</p><p>Along with an established film crew led by noted producer
(and recent Canadian Film Centre inductee) Ali Mashayekhi, <b>The Style Atlas</b> will be comprised of a 5-part documentary series,
taking place in an 8-week shooting schedule this fall.  Each episode can be seen as a stand-alone
program or part of a continuing narrative. For this specific initiative we have
strategically picked the following countries keeping cultural and ethnic
diversity in mind: </p>
<ul>
<li>Istanbul,
 Turkey</li>
<li>Seoul, South Korea</li>
<li>Almaty, Kazakhstan</li>
<li>Delhi, India</li>
<li>Jakarta,

community and help <b>The Style Atlas</b>
come to fruition. I look forward to working together with you in raising 91K USD for this specific venture.  The
reason I picked the crowd funding channel via 
Indiegogo is because I decided to forgo the traditional film making
route i.e.: looking to select studios for select funding.  The reason is because I want to ensure that
there is no tug-of-war when it comes to creative control with inexperienced
executives. Especially in this case when it comes to discussing sensitive
geo-political aspects of the country. There will be no risk of falling into the
sensationalism route with me being at the helm.<br/><br/><i>Here's where our budget will be going:</i><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462934983/pie_chart_lvoupl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>Another reason on why I'm doing this is that instead of me
just self-financing this project, this route reflects the spirit of how I
created Ramp1885.com  (my global fashion
website) all with the support of a community behind me. It’s more effective to
go to a distribution company to show that I have all these supporters who have
contributed. To paraphrase someone I met (and who recently led their very own
successful Indiegogo campaign) self-financing is basically me saying, “This is
a great idea. And you know who else likes it? Me.”
So of course it goes without saying that without your
generous support <b>The Style Atlas</b>

world of style. So it’s time to talk, traverse and take
it all in.<br/></p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462933788/meet_x68qa5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462933814/hina_HS_naw7ig.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I'm a self-professed global fashion &amp; culture hunter, I love exploring how fashion is embraced all over the world and in cities/countries that aren't necessarily on the typical ""fashion"" radar.

<h3>COUNTER.ACT BOXING SHOE</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Hello every one!! thank you for visiting our crowdfunding page. This is to raise funds for the newest boxing shoe we came up with the partnership between Rumble Brothers Boxing and Bryant Boxing called the COUNTER.ACT boxing shoe.</li>
<li>This campaign is to begin production and get the shoes off the ground. Researching and trying on different boxing shoes out there, we plan to offer a very different approach and feel to the boxing shoe line altogether. The Counter.Act shoe will take a lot of inspiration from some of the current trends that are popular today, while maintaining the functionality of a boxing shoe.</li>
<li>With your help, we can introduce a new trend and look of the boxing shoe line. Boxing Shoes have a history of poor taste and design, and this is where we can change that and innovate to a higher standard.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>For production and funding of the Counter.Act shoe, we need a start-up of $8,000. This will help up get the production going and get pre-orders out to customers.</li>
<li>But thats not all. Some of the perks we offer will be exclusive shirts and boxing gloves that matches the respective color of the Counter.Act from either variant of Rumble Brothers or Bryant Boxing. Match and work in style with your new shoes!!</li>
<li>And if we don't reach our goal (but i know we will) we will use the funds to meet the pre-orders that you made and use them to continue production of the shoes.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>As we stated before, both brands (Rumble Brothers and Bryant Boxing) feel that there is a lack of fresh and innovative approach to boxing shoes. and this is where we hope to change that and offer a cool, clean, and different design to our customers all over.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only risk we face is not having your size available when production is complete and sizes ship out. Don't be that guy (or girl, we don't discriminate) and pledge your order now with us.</p>

Hello every one!! thank you for visiting our crowdfunding page. This is to raise funds for the newest boxing shoe we came up with the partnership between Rumble Brothers Boxing and Bryant Boxing called the COUNTER.ACT boxing shoe.
This campaign is to begin production and get the shoes off the ground. Researching and trying on different boxing shoes out there, we plan to offer a very different approach and feel to the boxing shoe line altogether.

With your help, we can introduce a new trend and look of the boxing shoe line. Boxing Shoes have a history of poor taste and design, and this is where we can change that and innovate to a higher standard.

 
What We Need & What You Get

 

For production and funding of the Counter.Act shoe, we need a start-up of $8,000. This will help up get the production going and get pre-orders out to customers.
But thats not all. Some of the perks we offer will be exclusive shirts and boxing gloves that matches the respective color of the Counter.Act from either variant of Rumble Brothers or Bryant Boxing. Match and work in style with your new shoes!!
And if we don't reach our goal (but i know we will) we will use the funds to meet the pre-orders that you made and use them to continue production of the shoes.


The Impact
 
As we stated before, both brands (Rumble Brothers and Bryant Boxing) feel that there is a lack of fresh and innovative approach to boxing shoes. and this is where we hope to change that and offer a cool, clean, and different design to our customers all over.

Risks & Challenges
The only risk we face is not having your size available when production is complete and sizes ship out. Don't be that guy (or girl, we don't discriminate) and pledge your order now with us.

is my business philosophy. INTIMALENA is a brand that
promotes culture in fashion. The mission is to create and produce unique
jewelry and apparel that make women feel proud of their heritage and promote an awareness and appreciation of different cultures. INTIMALENA’s goals are to improve
the lives of others by promoting education, cultural exchange, and community
development through its business.My name is Wendy Ramirez, I’m a designer and the founder of INTIMALENA. I discovered a love for fashion and design when I was
only 10 years old.  I wanted to be a
designer but I also wanted to help my community. Instead of design school I
went to law school, worked in Congress and international development. Almost a
year ago I left my job to return to my passion of designing. I am driven to build
a business that gives back to the community and promotes cultural exchange.Your donation and support of this
campaign will help me:
Raise
funds to design and place orders for handmade goods from Mayan artisan communities in
Yucatan and Chiapas;Test
and understand how to work with Mayan communities incorporating my
designs and their artisan work into products to be sold in the US;Raise
funds for the first stage of developing an E-commerce website and online
subscription platform for INTIMALENA jewelry;Develop
educational and marketing materials about the history and technique used for each piece that include packaging and labels; andContinue
developing my skills as a designer.The Perks that you can receive each represents an ancient Mayan city. Each item has a history and tries to preserve culture and tradition as well as supports community development. Most of your donation will go directly to
the artisans creating your item. The two foundations that I am working with in Mexico are
Taller Maya in Yucatan and Aid to Artisans/Creative Learning in Chiapas. Thanks to the support of
the U.S.-Mexico Foundation I visited both of these organizations, met and saw
firsthand the work of the artisans. Where does your money go? Approximately 50% of your donation will go directly to the artisan making the goods, 30% will be used to grow INTIMALENA and 20% will be used for logistics and operations, including shipping from Mexico, packaging website platform and hosting fees for this campaign.  This percentage may vary depending on the perks that are selected.                            Other ways that you can support:

<p>Hi. My name is Molly Beane. I started <a href=""http://frommollywithlove.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">From Molly With Love</a> 2.5 years ago from the kitchen of my 500 sq. ft. apartment in San Diego, Calif. I'd been making my own skincare products as a hobby for years, but in 2016, I was freshly out of rehab for alcoholism and out of a job (I'd been in PR/marketing for a decade). It was the lowest point of my life. So naturally, I decided to take that pain and create something beautiful with it. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545255757/b67pqpibrngqcewpyndy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Producing a 14,000 unit order</i></p>
<p>We started with just a few hundred dollars on Etsy in Aug 2016. 2.5 years later, From Molly With Love sells in hundreds of retail stores, including Urban Outfitters. We also sell on Amazon and are gearing up for both retail &amp; ecommerce expansion in 2019. We're now a team of 5 employees and growing. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>A team that protests together stays together ;-) </i></p>
<p>We sell all-natural ""clean"" facial skincare, bath &amp; body products &amp; aromatherapy. Our products look &amp; perform like ""luxury"" products without the high price tag. We believe that everyone should have access to healthy skincare products. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Celebrating our launch at Francesca's</i></p>
<p>Because I bootstrapped my company myself (with very little funds), we have experienced some growing pains in the last year. I noticed that it was sometimes taking our customers awhile to receive their product - and I wanted to improve the production process, enhance product quality, and streamline our shipping processes so customers can get their orders faster. </p>

It was the lowest point of my life. So naturally, I decided to take that pain and create something beautiful with it. 

Producing a 14,000 unit order
We started with just a few hundred dollars on Etsy in Aug 2016. 2.5 years later, From Molly With Love sells in hundreds of retail stores, including Urban Outfitters. We also sell on Amazon and are gearing up for both retail & ecommerce expansion in 2019. We're now a team of 5 employees and growing. 

We taught ourselves how to pack palettes!

A team that protests together stays together ;-) 
We sell all-natural ""clean"" facial skincare, bath & body products & aromatherapy. Our products look & perform like ""luxury"" products without the high price tag. We believe that everyone should have access to healthy skincare products. 

Celebrating our launch at Francesca's
Because I bootstrapped my company myself (with very little funds), we have experienced some growing pains in the last year. I noticed that it was sometimes taking our customers awhile to receive their product - and I wanted to improve the production process, enhance product quality, and streamline our shipping processes so customers can get their orders faster. 

I know customer satisfaction is what is going to help us get to the next level. So we're raising money so we can keep our customer first as we grow. 



What We Need & What You Get
We're hoping to raise at least $50,000 in 50 days. Here is how we will use the funds: 

We will move to a new production facility so we have more space to work as we grow. We're totally grown out of our current facility. This new facility will adhere to Good Manufacturing Practices and will be better organized so we can work more efficiently.
Stock up on inventory to shorten shipping & lead times for customers.
Improve product quality. 
Improve customer service. 



We want to keep our customers our central focus as we grow. These funds will help us grow & scale, while allowing us to better serve our customers. 

This was taken at a local boutique in San Diego that carries our products. We did a chakra workshop where we taught the audience about chakras and how to use these sprays in yoga, meditation, or around the house.
