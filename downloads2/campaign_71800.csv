<p>MCSI had an incredible

such a short time, thanks to the wonderful support of our amazing customers. We

<p>With the help and support
we received from <b><a href=""http://www.revbirmingham.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">REV Birmingham</a></b>, we were able to launch our business last June

<div>Building community is one of the most important aspects of our personal lives, and we've brought this same spirit as a core of our business model. The funds that we're raising in this campaign, will also go towards helping set-up this store to be used as a facility for training future entrepreneurs. We will equip interested employees to start their own Italian Ice business and become small-business-owners themselves through our (BYOB – Be Your Own Boss) training program. Our long-term vision, is to also use this store as the model for future stores as worker-owned locations. We strongly believe that providing more well-paying jobs and keeping more of the neighborhoods where it is earned, makes more business sense, and strengthens our local economy.<br/>

affected victims scrambling for space in a tent that could accommodate no more
than 20 individuals.
As we spoke to them  we learnt gradually about
the tragedy that had befallen this group of villagers..   The
swollen eyes of women and choked voice of Tshwang Lama, a preacher and head monk  revealed their horror . In a quivering voice
he said, ""Nothing remains of our village </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><del>(</del>Baruwa.<del>)</del>,
Not a single house stands"". His calm and compassionate eyes looked at us
non-chalantly<del>,</del>.<del> w</del>e
 all choked with grief while listening to
the whole story. We learnt that a
strong  7.8 magnitude Earthquake on  April 26, 2015 had wiped
out the 558 houses of Baruwa </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">village</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">
in Sindhupalchowk District of central Nepal affected the entire population. We</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">, the
(SEEW) team members were overwhelmed to hear about such devastation.  and directly And instead of  continuing to distribute relief to victims in far-flung
villages of Sindupalchowk,  we stayed on to help this displaced Tamang
community who were taking shelter in  the
open fields of Mulpani,suburbs east of the Kathmandu valley..</span><div>
<p>With tears in his eye, Nima
Lama of Baruwa Ward number 8 narrated the devastation with graphic detail to us
saying…. ""The land sank two feet and all the houses turned into heaps of stone,
 mud, and debris all around.  We buried 83 peopleand had no option but
at times to bury almost 5-7 bodies in one grave. Wehad to free all
the living animals, so they could roam around to find fodder and grasses. However
we couldn't bear the stench of the animal Caracas lying all around us,. It was
terrible and in order to
survive we had to leave the village "". </p>
<p>We
learnt that they had walked for 6 hours in one stretch from their village until
they arrived at a town called Melamchi and took a bus to arrive at Mulpani. We
knew that thefury of the  violent earthquake has destroyed up to 90 per
cent of the houses in the two districts of Sindupalchowk and Kavrepalanchowk
(UNDP OCHA, may 2015). Sindhupalchowk and neighbouring Kavre districts are
endowed with immense natural beauty but the destruction brought by the quake
have made them stand in bare stark contrast to their earlier appearances..</p>
<p>The 7.8 <span><del>-</del>magnitude earthquake
with its epicenter in Barpak village in Gorkha district<del>,</del> has claimed more
than 8, 000 lives and over  20,000 injuries
, ten days after it  struck Nepal.. The
most severely affected district called  Sindhupalchowk
is about 60 kms from the capital city Kathmandu.</span></p>
<p>The Mulpani refugee
victims are gradually coming to terms with their camp life existence for the
interim moment. When we met them they were 70 people including a three month
infant Now they are 100 people altogether from two VDC.  Women folks out numbered men in the group. As
they explained to us <span><del>,</del> all of their houses have collapsed. <del>,</del>
Dry landslides occur almost everywhere and <del>, </del>their lands have
cracked and crops destroyed. They were not sure how many cattle died. Filled
with tears, one young man narrated,  “we untied the living animals from where they
were, left them in the open and said goodbye”. They were not sure if the cattle
will be alive in the future and if they will be able to see their dear animals.
They also told us that before leaving their village for Kathmandu, some men
went to another village, called Balgaun, (situated above their village) where
the disaster and loss was more painful. These people said that it is not sure
how many people died in Balgaun. When they reached there, they were able to
bury 35 dead bodies before they left for Kathmandu. They were requesting us for
a helicopter to rescue the stranded people in Balgaun village. </span></p>
<p>Currently, the victims
from Baruwa are living under worn out tarpaulin tents which will not protect
them from strong gust of winds or constant monsoon rain.. Currently, the victim’s
 do s not have toilet facilities nor potable drinking water. Anxiety,
horror, fear and uncertainty was visible in the faces of the entire community. The
rapidly approaching monsoon rain will  further
delay their return and they would be stranded here for almost another six months.</p>
<p>We consoled them with
kind words and consolidated our emotions with tears and genuine empathy. What they
actually need immediately are  proper
food, tents, blankets, first-aid-kits and clean clothes. In addition, they also
need clean drinking water, medicine and toilet facilities. Furthermore,  in order to come to a normal condition, they
need trauma counseling and advice and emotional support as are still horrified
with their terrible tragedy back home.. Clearly long term rehabilitation and reintegration
will be needed for sustainable peace and prosperity and that will be the true
gift to the environment and human condition from which they  have survived the deadly earthquake. A well
planned and executed long term intervention activities will ensure better
housing and safety while reintegrating within their own communities eventually.
Social Empowerment by Empowering Women (SEEW) is tirelessly at times walking many
miles to deliver basic amenities to the victims; <span><del>,</del> we stand strong
and commit ourselves to long term rehabilitation and reintegration initiatives
of these families  - especially the hardest hit
district of Sindupalchowk.  As the all
seeing eyes of the  Buddha eyes looks
from the Stupa of Boudanath monastery nearby, 
showering blessings for well being of these people; we in , SEEW will
not sleep until we  have successfully
reconstruct the lives of these poor and deserving victims of the earthquake.</span></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
 70 earthquake
affected victims scrambling for space in a tent that could accommodate no more
than 20 individuals.
As we spoke to them  we learnt gradually about
the tragedy that had befallen this group of villagers..   The
swollen eyes of women and choked voice of Tshwang Lama, a preacher and head monk  revealed their horror . In a quivering voice
he said, ""Nothing remains of our village (Baruwa.),
Not a single house stands"". His calm and compassionate eyes looked at us
non-chalantly,. we
 all choked with grief while listening to
the whole story. We learnt that a
strong  7.8 magnitude Earthquake on  April 26, 2015 had wiped
out the 558 houses of Baruwa village
in Sindhupalchowk District of central Nepal affected the entire population. We, the
(SEEW) team members were overwhelmed to hear about such devastation.  and directly And instead of  continuing to distribute relief to victims in far-flung
villages of Sindupalchowk,  we stayed on to help this displaced Tamang
community who were taking shelter in  the
open fields of Mulpani,suburbs east of the Kathmandu valley..
With tears in his eye, Nima
Lama of Baruwa Ward number 8 narrated the devastation with graphic detail to us
saying…. ""The land sank two feet and all the houses turned into heaps of stone,
 mud, and debris all around.  We buried 83 peopleand had no option but
at times to bury almost 5-7 bodies in one grave. Wehad to free all
the living animals, so they could roam around to find fodder and grasses. However
we couldn't bear the stench of the animal Caracas lying all around us,. It was
terrible and in order to
survive we had to leave the village "". 
We
learnt that they had walked for 6 hours in one stretch from their village until
they arrived at a town called Melamchi and took a bus to arrive at Mulpani. We
knew that thefury of the  violent earthquake has destroyed up to 90 per
cent of the houses in the two districts of Sindupalchowk and Kavrepalanchowk
(UNDP OCHA, may 2015). Sindhupalchowk and neighbouring Kavre districts are
endowed with immense natural beauty but the destruction brought by the quake
have made them stand in bare stark contrast to their earlier appearances..
The 7.8 -magnitude earthquake
with its epicenter in Barpak village in Gorkha district, has claimed more
than 8, 000 lives and over  20,000 injuries
, ten days after it  struck Nepal.. The
most severely affected district called  Sindhupalchowk
is about 60 kms from the capital city Kathmandu.
The Mulpani refugee
victims are gradually coming to terms with their camp life existence for the
interim moment. When we met them they were 70 people including a three month
infant Now they are 100 people altogether from two VDC.  Women folks out numbered men in the group. As
they explained to us , all of their houses have collapsed. ,
Dry landslides occur almost everywhere and , their lands have
cracked and crops destroyed. They were not sure how many cattle died. Filled
with tears, one young man narrated,  “we untied the living animals from where they
were, left them in the open and said goodbye”. They were not sure if the cattle
will be alive in the future and if they will be able to see their dear animals.
They also told us that before leaving their village for Kathmandu, some men
went to another village, called Balgaun, (situated above their village) where
the disaster and loss was more painful. These people said that it is not sure
how many people died in Balgaun. When they reached there, they were able to
bury 35 dead bodies before they left for Kathmandu. They were requesting us for
a helicopter to rescue the stranded people in Balgaun village. 
Currently, the victims
from Baruwa are living under worn out tarpaulin tents which will not protect
them from strong gust of winds or constant monsoon rain.. Currently, the victim’s
 do s not have toilet facilities nor potable drinking water. Anxiety,
horror, fear and uncertainty was visible in the faces of the entire community. The
rapidly approaching monsoon rain will  further
delay their return and they would be stranded here for almost another six months.
We consoled them with
kind words and consolidated our emotions with tears and genuine empathy. What they
actually need immediately are  proper
food, tents, blankets, first-aid-kits and clean clothes. In addition, they also
need clean drinking water, medicine and toilet facilities. Furthermore,  in order to come to a normal condition, they
need trauma counseling and advice and emotional support as are still horrified
with their terrible tragedy back home.. Clearly long term rehabilitation and reintegration
will be needed for sustainable peace and prosperity and that will be the true
gift to the environment and human condition from which they  have survived the deadly earthquake. A well
planned and executed long term intervention activities will ensure better
housing and safety while reintegrating within their own communities eventually.
Social Empowerment by Empowering Women (SEEW) is tirelessly at times walking many
miles to deliver basic amenities to the victims; , we stand strong
and commit ourselves to long term rehabilitation and reintegration initiatives
of these families  - especially the hardest hit
district of Sindupalchowk.  As the all
seeing eyes of the  Buddha eyes looks
from the Stupa of Boudanath monastery nearby, 
showering blessings for well being of these people; we in , SEEW will
not sleep until we  have successfully
reconstruct the lives of these poor and deserving victims of the earthquake.



What We Need

We need  US $ 10.000 to make a Safe Shelter & Two Toilets(For Men & Women) for them to stay at least for 6 months as the weather will be worse in the coming few months and they cannot return back to their village.
Why Us
The funds we collect will go directly to these people as we have been supporting them now with immediate reliefs and we can reach them directly.

Transparency
A promise to direct the money to local people who need the money the most and a very transparent accounting of the money spent.We will not give the money to the local leaders or local people who can misuse it instead we will buy things and go to the location to provide the earthquake survivors.

His parents were not surprised when his first spoken word as a baby was ""car"". As a child he would use his little fingers to take apart and put back together his toys, as well as repairing them when needed, and all through grade school he was under the hood of many cars, helping his dad repair the family car, or helping neighbors repair theirs. When the opportunity to work at an automotive repair shop for high school credits came up, he jumped on the opportunity and his knowledge and skill blossomed. At the young age of 16 he had the chance to be a partial owner of an automotive shop. While working there and earning more shares in the business, he gained a reputation for being one of the best. When other shops had difficulty working on a vehicle or diagnosing a vehicle, David was the first call they made. Not only is he the best in his trade, he has also learned what it takes to own and properly run an automotive shop. He has always run a very clean shop, with white walls and clean floors, and he treats everyone like family. It was a very tough decision for him when he decided to split from the partnership in order to open his very own shop with his fiancé. </em>

<strong>Stephanie - </strong>Born near Denver Colorado, Stephanie was raised around cars. Watching Formula 1 every Sunday with her dad, and attending car shows with her brothers helped fuel her passion for cars.

<p><b>My Story:</b> A series of oppressive situations forced Let Her Sing's founder, Jessica Crew, to reckon with pain and suffering. She wanted to find a better path and so began a journey to ""clear the noise"" that was suffocating her heart. Over time, Jessica saw how her mental beliefs were blocking her from good and abundance in life. Everything changed when she realized that she had agreed to the oppression in her life. In her own words, ""I had created my experiences and thus, I could create better ones."" </p>
<p><b>Let Her Sing is born. </b>This is when the <a href=""http://www.lethersing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Let Her Sing</a><a href=""www.lethersing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>women's empowerment event concept emerged. Drawing from the founder's own experiences, it was her desire to create a platform for the voice of women to be heard and to support women as they walk that better path. Being a musician herself, Jessica knew she had to incorporate performance art, as music in particular was an important part of her own expression and healing. She believes that the arts can open the heart in a very powerful way. </p>

My Story: A series of oppressive situations forced Let Her Sing's founder, Jessica Crew, to reckon with pain and suffering. She wanted to find a better path and so began a journey to ""clear the noise"" that was suffocating her heart. Over time, Jessica saw how her mental beliefs were blocking her from good and abundance in life. Everything changed when she realized that she had agreed to the oppression in her life. In her own words, ""I had created my experiences and thus, I could create better ones."" 
Let Her Sing is born. This is when the Let Her Sing women's empowerment event concept emerged. Drawing from the founder's own experiences, it was her desire to create a platform for the voice of women to be heard and to support women as they walk that better path. Being a musician herself, Jessica knew she had to incorporate performance art, as music in particular was an important part of her own expression and healing. She believes that the arts can open the heart in a very powerful way. 




What is Let Her Sing? Glad you asked! Let Her Sing is a concert-style event that inspires women to clear the noise. The concert inspires through speaking, song, dance, and spoken word.

What will your contributions accomplish? $100,000 will take Let Her Sing to 8 cities around the U.S. $100,000 is the minimum needed to begin the Let Her Sing 2016 national tour.

</div><p>  ATTRIBUTES OF THE ABM </p><div>
</div><p>The ABM is simple to use  through  our new touch screen.  The customer easily chooses a drink, then chooses his/her payment of choice. The ABM grinds and packs 14 grams of fresh whole coffee beans, then delivers 208 degree filtered water while applying 150 lbs. of pressure to extract a perfect,  and full bodied espresso coffee, creamy cappuccino or caffe latte. The milk is frothed thick and rich enough to rival the talents of a finely trained barista, while producing 60 cups per hour! Every cup is made from fresh roasted beans and fresh milk which are programmed to your exact specifications for temperature, proportion, and consistency. Innovations such as a large- capacity fridge, housing 8 x 4 liter jugs of fresh 1% milk (128 caffe latte capacity) and 4 liters of fresh cream (128 cup capacity) get pumped into drinks without interruption. Increased size of the 2 whole bean and 1 chocolate powder hoppers extends volumes (270 capacity). Our modular design assists in quick parts changes and on site assembly. Six syrups that include 4 flavors, sugar and sweetener. Fresh half and half cream at the push of a button for coffees. Liquid sugar and cream pours straight into the cup before coffee to mix without stirring and cuts per-cup production to under a minute. We are a whole coffee bar experience in 16 square feet with back ground café music, fan blowing fresh ground coffee aroma, logo rubber mat for leg, feet and back  comfort,  BMW dash board styling with an Italian car body inspired panels and paint.  </p><div>
</div><p>OUR BRAND AND STORY  The name Crema came from the fact that the best espresso coffees in the world have a creamy thick brown foam on top called Crema (the Italian word for Cream).  Crema can only be produced by fanatical quality control. Our ABM units produce crema effortlessly on every coffee drink it makes.  Crema on top of our Americano coffees resemble a perfectly poured pint of Guinness, that is why our branded cups look similar, (printed black cup with brown printed layer on top). Our coffees look different and are better with crema. They are smooth and creamy and tastes as good as fresh ground coffee smells, not watery and thin like most coffees that are sold.  </p><div>

</div><p><br/></p><div>
</div><p><strong>PLAN B</strong>  We place our ABMs at 1.5 employees per 10 units and if sales targets are not achieved, we hold the option to remove or relocate them. This is a huge advantage over traditional café chains that  close down a store and lose a massive investment, having to sell everything for pennies on the dollar. Crema Caffe ABMs not only hold their value in a location gone bad, but can be quickly moved to a location that will produce the original desired profits. In the case of customer line ups forming at an ABM we can add an additional ABM to service the high traffic demands. We can produce $500,000.00 per year from a single location with two or more ABMs either side by side or spread out around the same location.  </p><div>

</h3>
<div>I am a dreamer, a wife, a mother, and a baker.</div>
<div>For as long as I can remember, I have been regularly covered in flour, usually have chocolate on my shirt, own way too many cookie cutters, have an addiction to sprinkles, buy whipping cream 30 litres at a time, have a cookbook addiction that requires an intervention, and my art is baking.</div>
<div>Self-taught and tenacious and with 23 yrs of semi-professional baking experience, I am ready to wrestle with almost any kitchen appliance, I am passionate and I am opening a bakery in Old Walkerville, right near the river and across from the view of the Detroit skyline.</div>
<div>In the winter of 2013 I started a food blog. That was the beginning of The Little White Kitchen. <span><br/></span>From food blog to booth at the Downtown Windsor Farmer's Market in 2013, this gal carted a van load of gluten-free baked goods to sell, getting up at the crack of dawn and setting up shop. Soon I began making small-batch artisan ice cream and started selling ice cream sandwiches as well, making my poor hubby lift a freezer into our van at 6:30am every Saturday morning.<span><br/></span>Very quickly, my baking business got busier and busier. Some local restaurants took notice of me, and I started supplying them with desserts and gluten-free bread. My two Kitchen Aid mixers were soon in the company of a 20 qt floor mixer. My 3 small ice cream makers were replaced by an 80 lb commercial one. It started to snowball, until suddenly I was storing 800 lbs of flour at a time, going through 10-20 dozen eggs a week, and using over 50 of sugar every couple of weeks (I lost count of the insane amount of butter and chocolate I go through).</div>

<br/>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>My mission statement ? To provide the best possible yumminess, put together with the highest quality ingredients, a love of all things gluten-free and gluten-full, and all wrapped up and made with as much love as I can muster.</div>
<div>I am here. I am crowd funding. I have burst out of my current kitchen space and I'm busting at the seams to expand to help serve you more efficiently.</div>
<div>Our bakeshop was supposed to open in Ford City last fall, but that fell through and I was devastated. I had found the perfect space, in a location that truly needed someone to believe in them and in the rejuvenation of an area that's been too long ignored. I believed in Drouillard Rd and everything it had to offer.<span><br/></span><span>We worked hard and put out a lot of money to build our first space, but our landlord took advantage of us and didn't follow through with his deadlines and promises, and we had to leave the space before we even had a chance to open.<span><br/></span> After 4 mths of dreaming and hard work and lots of money, I was broken and devastated and not sure where to go next.<span><br/></span>I have been truly blessed to find a wonderful new space in Walkerville.<br/></span>The space in Walkerville is larger than the one on Drouillard and will allow for us to have a lovely cafe area as well as a designated bread kitchen.</div>
<div>I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!!</div>

</div>
<div>Our goal is to raise $30,000+ in the next month, so that we can finish what we've already started and purchase the rest of the equipment and furniture that we need to be able to open by May 1st.<br/>
</div>
<div>Throughout the last 5 months, the hubby and I have been working very hard to purchase as much equipment as we can, and we've spent over $30,000 to date. The majority of our equipment has been purchased used,  but we are thrilled with some of the wonderful items we've accumulated.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>To get this bakeshop up and running with everything we need to be able to create fabulous breads and </span>pastries for you, we still need at least $30,000 to purchase all of the remaining equipment and items like chairs and countertops. A large commercial mixer for the bread will cost about $4500, and a commercial freezer is around $4000, so you can see how the total adds up quickly.<span><br/></span> I hope you are as excited as I am about the wonderful possibilities and yumminess that will be the Little White Kitchen Baking Co. !!!!!</div>
<div>
<span>Every penny donated, will be spent wisely and we will purchase used equipment whenever we can.<span><br/></span></span>Make sure to check out the REWARDS/PERKS offered for different levels of contribution, since no good deed should go unrewarded. Let me BAKE FOR YOU!</div>

<span>I truly </span>appreciate every penny donated, since starting this venture with debt over my head will prohibit me from hiring the right amount of fabulous staff, and fabulous staff is what makes the world go around, right?</div>
<div>Windsor has a huge amount of unemployment right now, and small business are going to help bring those numbers down, with your help.<span><br/></span>
</div>
<div>My goal is to immediately employ 3 people right away (with the hopes of being up to 8 or 10 pretty quickly), all with a passion for baking and a enormous sense of adventure. I will need people to be at the shop early so that you can have wonderful bread for breakfast and lunch, someone will be on ice cream duty so that you can always have access to a freezer full of frozen treats, and of course we need someone making coffee and serving soup.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>I am also hoping to partner up with some youth initiatives in the community, and one day soon, start training young people to make bread and work in a kitchen environment. </span>

My mission statement ? To provide the best possible yumminess, put together with the highest quality ingredients, a love of all things gluten-free and gluten-full, and all wrapped up and made with as much love as I can muster.
I am here. I am crowd funding. I have burst out of my current kitchen space and I'm busting at the seams to expand to help serve you more efficiently.
Our bakeshop was supposed to open in Ford City last fall, but that fell through and I was devastated. I had found the perfect space, in a location that truly needed someone to believe in them and in the rejuvenation of an area that's been too long ignored. I believed in Drouillard Rd and everything it had to offer.We worked hard and put out a lot of money to build our first space, but our landlord took advantage of us and didn't follow through with his deadlines and promises, and we had to leave the space before we even had a chance to open. After 4 mths of dreaming and hard work and lots of money, I was broken and devastated and not sure where to go next.I have been truly blessed to find a wonderful new space in Walkerville.The space in Walkerville is larger than the one on Drouillard and will allow for us to have a lovely cafe area as well as a designated bread kitchen.
I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!!





So why is The Little White Kitchen Baking Co. a good thing to have in Windsor????Well…..We will be the ONLY bakery in Walkerville.We will be making everything from scratch, using the best ingredients we can source.We will continue to bake tons of gluten-free goodness, but will expand to include everything gluten-full as well.We will be making sourdough-based organic breads, with lovely ancient grains.We will be a local cafe with super fabulous teas and small batch roasted coffee.We will be one of the only places in Windsor where you can enjoy homemade artisan ice cream (I will always make ice cream sandwiches as well)We will be THAT bakery. The kind you remember going to as a child.


Everyone that contributes to this campaign is a partnering up with me, with my vision for a bakery in Walkerville, and with a brand new small business that will grow and create jobs.
One thing……I NEED YOUR HELP!!




The Money Talk

Our goal is to raise $30,000+ in the next month, so that we can finish what we've already started and purchase the rest of the equipment and furniture that we need to be able to open by May 1st.

Throughout the last 5 months, the hubby and I have been working very hard to purchase as much equipment as we can, and we've spent over $30,000 to date. The majority of our equipment has been purchased used,  but we are thrilled with some of the wonderful items we've accumulated.To get this bakeshop up and running with everything we need to be able to create fabulous breads and pastries for you, we still need at least $30,000 to purchase all of the remaining equipment and items like chairs and countertops. A large commercial mixer for the bread will cost about $4500, and a commercial freezer is around $4000, so you can see how the total adds up quickly. I hope you are as excited as I am about the wonderful possibilities and yumminess that will be the Little White Kitchen Baking Co. !!!!!

Every penny donated, will be spent wisely and we will purchase used equipment whenever we can.Make sure to check out the REWARDS/PERKS offered for different levels of contribution, since no good deed should go unrewarded. Let me BAKE FOR YOU!









The Impact of your Donation.




I truly appreciate every penny donated, since starting this venture with debt over my head will prohibit me from hiring the right amount of fabulous staff, and fabulous staff is what makes the world go around, right?
Windsor has a huge amount of unemployment right now, and small business are going to help bring those numbers down, with your help.

My goal is to immediately employ 3 people right away (with the hopes of being up to 8 or 10 pretty quickly), all with a passion for baking and a enormous sense of adventure. I will need people to be at the shop early so that you can have wonderful bread for breakfast and lunch, someone will be on ice cream duty so that you can always have access to a freezer full of frozen treats, and of course we need someone making coffee and serving soup.I am also hoping to partner up with some youth initiatives in the community, and one day soon, start training young people to make bread and work in a kitchen environment. 
 



    Risks & Challenges Of course there are always risks to any venture, but I believe, with 100% of my heart and soul, that The Little White Kitchen Baking Co. needs to exist. It needs to move from the dream of a food blog, to a small booth at the farmer's market, to a brick and mortar home. It's an organic entity and it needs to grow.I will do everything in my power to make this work, to use my money wisely, to treat my staff with love and respect, to serve the people of Windsor (and whoever else pops in for a visit) with enthusiasm and to help contribute to the revitalization of the beautiful Walkerville area.
Your support, your prayers, your encouragement, your business and your contribution to The Little White Kitchen Baking Co. is your declaration that you believe in me, you support my crazy dreams, you want to see a small business succeed and you just want to help build a place where you can enjoy baked goods and pastries baked with as much love as I can muster.


Other Ways You Can Help
 I know more than anyone that sometimes it's not possible to support a project monetarily, but there are so many other ways you can help out!!
Prayers~ please pray for guidance and wisdom as we move forward
Labour ~ we will need as much skilled labour and enthusiastic painters as we can find. We will only have a couple of weeks to build the space once we get in there, and we can't do it alone
Spread the WORD!!!! ~ so YOU can't spare a dime, but you may know someone that is just dying for a fun bakeshop to open and has money to burn!! Maybe they'd like to this gal out? You never know…..",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","FOR OBVIOUS REASONS WE CANNOT ACCEPT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM LANDLORDS, LETTING AGENTS, ESTATE AGENTS OR ANY OTHER AFFILIATIONS.We're a review website, how would it look taking money from those being reviewed?
We think tenants deserve a rental market that is clear, informative and honest.
Marks Out Of Tenancy offers tenants the power to rate landlords, letting agents, properties and areas from individual experiences and offers insights into the market from those who have lived it.  


Almost everyone has a renting story - good, bad, humorous, terrifying, expensive, distressing, life changing...frustrating. Ask the person next to you now, ""What was your worst rental experience"" - it'll probably appall you - but we want to hear it, the world needs to hear it. Your landlord needs to hear it.
Buying a house for most people will remain something of a pipe dream for many years, and may never be realised. You'll be making your home in a house owned by someone else. That person has responsibilities to you - you are paying them money - probably half your monthly in many cases - it's a LOT of money. It’s the same story the world over; more and more people are renting, and people are paying more and more on their rent. America, Australia, UK, Europe - renting is on the rise, so we want to make sure landlords and letting agents are performing to the highest standard possible. You wouldn't accept poor quality product or service from anywhere else, if your hotel room isn't up to scratch - you let them know. You buy a bad product online - you send it back.So why can't we do that with our rental properties? The places in which we eat, sleep and live. Accountability can only be enforced when there is a voice, many voices, asking the same questions - ""Why is my home expensive and badly maintained?"", ""Where is my deposit?"", ""Why can I be evicted without explanation?"" 

A review website about rental properties bursting at the seams with stories of rip-offs, injustice, misery, injury, frustration and calls for change will...change the private rental market. Similarly, tales of great landlords who make renting a pleasure will encourage others to strive to do the same. It will provide a platform for voices of renters whilst they are renting, after they rent and when they are looking for new home to rent. We want to restore balance in a market that has been controlled by landlords and letting agents for so long.
Altruism is the fuel for this change. This knowledge, curated, collated and organised in a powerful and contemporary website is a powerful tool for change. Share your voice so others may improve their lives. You will spend 25% of all the money you earn in your life on renting - let's make it a good purchase.









Users are able to view and contribute to ratings and reviews of properties, landlords, letting agents and areas, giving the richest and most true-to-life picture of the renting market available. You’ll be able to hear the experiences of real tenants who have lived in the properties you’re viewing, not the wide angle lenses and endless euphemisms offered by those trying to get any old signature on the tenancy agreement.  After contributing a review, you are able to store your tenancy history privately and securely on our site. This offers users the opportunity to store contact numbers, energy certificates, broadband suppliers - everything that pertains to any of your tenancies that you might need to call upon is available and only a click away.  On top of all of this you can look back at all your old ratings and reviews, hopefully from a much more comfortable and secure home.  
We love information because the more information available to tenants the fairer a market we can develop. Once we start to build a real community on Marks Out Of Tenancy, we can offer detailed insight and analysis of the market from the tenant’s perspective. Pulling the data that we input together, we can start to build solid evidence showing what’s good and bad about the private rental market - Which city has the most eco-friendly properties? Where is home to the best landlords? Where do people tend to move to when they leave London? - we want to provide tenants with data that is going to help them to make the most informed decision when it comes to moving house.  
Our focus is always going to be about balancing the market. We understand there are drastic changes that need to be made to ease issues in the Private Rental Sector and we support those working to make this happen. We’re here to make sure renters gets the best possible experience from their tenancy and if that’s not so, we’re here to make sure others don’t fall into the same trap.We're not making a gadget, or a film, or a transmedia experience. Essentially, we're making a review website, with the aim to initiate a fundamental shift in the private rental market - we want to start a movement.Firstly, thank you for your support, whatever it is - if you pledged money for perks - amazing -  thank you. If you just shared a story with a friend about a terrible renting experience, thank you also - the more people talking about a re-balancing of the rental space the better.Ok, brass tacks - what are we going to spend the money on?:

A website, but this is no cookie cutter WordPress theme we're going to throw up in an afternoon; this is a full fat, bespoke, ground-up build that will handle thousands of tenant review, millions of data points and be optimised for international usage. We're including: 



Telling people about Marks Out of Tenancy (yeah, marketing) - without a healthy and vibrant user community a review website is...just a website. 


Staffing - we're planning long term, we are three guys fleshing out a concept that has a huge ground swell of support developing - at the grassroots level and in local and national governmental discourse. We're gonna need good people, who share our ideologies, energy and intent. 








We understand rents are rising, so if you’re into the idea but your income is steadily siphoned into the pocket of your landlord, do not worry.

</h3><p>Panaroamer isn’t designed just for ride share services.  It is designed to open up the world around
you by connecting you to people and companies with similar interests.  Panaroamer can help you find a date, find a
plumber, a babysitter, great deals on food, and anything else you could
imagine.  The best part is that all of
these can be done within a single application. 
You control how Panaroamer will work for you.  If you are hungry, create a food interest and
see restaurants near you.  If you need
some work done on your house, create a service interest and see qualified
professionals near you.  And, of course,
if you need a ride, choose the ride share option and see drivers near you.  With each search result you can see profiles
of the people and companies along with their reviews from the others in our
community.  Keep in touch with your
friends, make new ones, you control how you use Panaroamer.  All of this is done
dynamically.  Once you set up your
interests, the system will seamlessly store all of your alerts for you to view
at any time.

</p><p>



As a messaging system, there is something for everyone. 
Our messaging service is not the typical one on one service.  Sure you can chat with your friends,
new people with similar interests, or even a local business that has their
customer support on our system, but there is much more you can do.  For businesses, you can send a single message
to many of your customers that are currently in your area.  The customers have to express interest in
your store and add you to their lists, but once that is done you can
communicate freely.  These communications
can be set to one way or two ways.  One
way means the recipients cannot reply. 
Two way means that they can.  For
customers, you can receive messages from local business with special deals and
offers.  You will only receive these
messages if you express an interest in those companies or their products.  For service providers, our messaging system
allows you to communicate with one, some, or all of your employees.  These messages can also be one way or two
ways.</p><h3>
</h3><h2>How Does Panaroamer Work for You:</h2><p>

Panaroamer is able to help with many different tasks in many
different industries.  Here are some
stories that illustrate typical use cases.</p><h4>

Freelance Driver:</h4><p>

If you are a freelance driver, Panaroamer connects you to
potential riders.  You can see their
profiles, destination, and the number of passengers before you agree to take
their business.  Once you finish the
ride, and you and your passenger agree that the service was great, then you can
favorite each other.  This is the start
of you building your client base!  As
your client base grows, then you will get priority booking for your
clients.  When they request rides and
you are in their area, you will get matched first.  You will also appear on the top of their list
for scheduled rides.  You can set your
own prices so you can maximize your profits. 
There is also a built in tipping system and that is all yours as well.</p><h4>

Limo/Taxi Services:</h4><p>

Panaroamer gives Limo and Taxi services the same benefits of
most ride share systems, but with some added features.  As a dispatcher, you can see where your
drivers are at any point.  They can
contact you if there are any problems, like if they get a flat tire or have to
stop for gas.  The dispatcher can also
maintain communication with the customers to keep them apprised of the driver’s
location and estimated time of arrival. 
You can also keep track of your drivers and how they are doing with the
built in review system.</p><h4>Retailers:</h4><p>
</p><p>If you are a retailer, Panaroamer offers you a unique targeted
advertising system that will change the way you communicate with potential
consumers.  It allows you to send any type of message to a customer in or
near your store based on what they are interested in purchasing.  This
will increase your opportunities to engage your customers and increase your
opportunity to close a sale by offering special enticements.  These deals can be unique to a specific
customer, to a specific product, to everyone, to everything.  To find out
more details and information on this section, please contact us at <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@panaroamer.com</a>.</p>
<h4>

Private Contractors (Plumbers, Electricians, etc.)</h4><p>

As a private contractor, Panaroamer can help you manage your
employees, establish a client base, and communicate with current
customers.  Panaroamer allows you to
instant message your clients to inform them of when you will arrive.  You can optionally share your location so
they know you are on the way.  You will
be able to also know where your employees are at any time and communicate with
them instantly.  With our messaging
service, you send a single message to all of your field workers.  This will help you maintain their locations
and their work time.  Panaroamer will
also save and store client information and build up your rolodex of customers.  </p><h4>

Dating and People Connection:</h4><p>

For those of you that are looking to find that special
person or to just hang out with someone new, Panaroamer allows you to connect
to anyone around you.  This, of course,
assumes that both of you have similar interests and choose to connect.  You can ignore those requests that do not
meet your expectations and chat with those that do.  You can also send private messages, images,
or videos that can automatically be deleted after the person views it.</p><p>

If you are new to town and just want to watch a game at a
local bar, Panaroamer can connect you with others that have the same
interests.  With our Quick Connect
feature, you can join conversations or start your own conversation on any topic
you choose.</p><h3>
</h3><h4>Developer: 
</h4><h3>
</h3><p>We need developers to come join our community and start
creating your own applications.  You can
devote your energy and efforts on your ideas, we’ll provide you with the
technology.  If you have a game that
needs the ability to connect players, we have the solution.  If you want to integrate instant messaging
into your workout application, we have you covered.  If you need to add rich in depth analytics
to your web services, we’ve done all of the heavy lifting.  We will assist you in implementing our APIs
to provide a seamless service to your users all in a secure environment that
only you can access.</p><p>
We also need developers to help design new features and
improve on current features.  Panaroamer
is designed to be a community that grows together.  We are excited to provide a platform with
limitless possibilities.</p><p>
<b><i>So come join us, and we will help you make your ideas a
reality.</i></b></p><h3>

Who
We Are</h3>
<p>We are a Delaware Incorporated
company that consist of an enthusiastic team of technically savvy
entrepreneurs with more than 40 years of applied experience in startups, mobile,
database, cloud, internetworking, and telecommunications technologies.  We
have strong relationships within the software industry and can attract
top-level talent.</p><h3>The
Impact</h3>
<p>As a team we have been working on
this project for more than two years and we are about four months from launching our ride share solution. We believe that once the public sees the power of our platform on the ride
share side, we can then expose them to other products in the Panaroamer suite. </p>
<p>Our primary goal is to assist people
in creating their own businesses, starting with a ride share business. For
those already running their own businesses, we want to help them to better
connect to new and current customers. Our system supports targeted ads that can
reach anyone in the community who indicates a similar interest. You get access
to our unique ride share system by way of features not available in any other
rideshare system. You set your rates, you earn and keep your tips, you grow
your client base, and you set your own schedules. Partner up with your friends
and build your own rideshare corporation. The best part is that budgeting is
easy. One monthly fee is all it takes!  </p><h3>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for funding to help
our team focus solely on this project.  We will be strengthening our
engineering team and infrastructure. The team will focus on completing the ride share solution.  We will then start building out our other solutions while continuing to update and improve our rideshare solution.  Additionally, we will add
some new team members to assist with marketing and business development. We
will also build a superior customer support team. Our community will grow by
and for our users. As such, we will do everything possible to make sure they
have the best experience possible.  </p>
<p>We are offering special perks to
those who want to support us in our endeavor to challenge the status quo. For
our friends with the entrepreneurial spirit, we are offering a perk that could
open up some amazing possibilities. The first 5000 drivers that donate $1000
will receive lifetime access to our ride share services. You will never pay us
another cent to use our system. No revenue splitting, no additional monthly
fees!</p>
<p>For those that want to try it out
for a few months, we are offering two free months of ride share if you prepay
for the first month.</p>

of the people and companies along with their reviews from the others in our
community.  Keep in touch with your
friends, make new ones, you control how you use Panaroamer.  All of this is done
dynamically.  Once you set up your
interests, the system will seamlessly store all of your alerts for you to view
at any time.





As a messaging system, there is something for everyone. 
Our messaging service is not the typical one on one service.  Sure you can chat with your friends,
new people with similar interests, or even a local business that has their
customer support on our system, but there is much more you can do.  For businesses, you can send a single message
to many of your customers that are currently in your area.  The customers have to express interest in
your store and add you to their lists, but once that is done you can
communicate freely.  These communications
can be set to one way or two ways.  One
way means the recipients cannot reply. 
Two way means that they can.  For
customers, you can receive messages from local business with special deals and
offers.  You will only receive these
messages if you express an interest in those companies or their products.  For service providers, our messaging system
allows you to communicate with one, some, or all of your employees.  These messages can also be one way or two
ways.
How Does Panaroamer Work for You:

Panaroamer is able to help with many different tasks in many
different industries.  Here are some
stories that illustrate typical use cases.

Freelance Driver:

If you are a freelance driver, Panaroamer connects you to
potential riders.  You can see their
profiles, destination, and the number of passengers before you agree to take
their business.  Once you finish the
ride, and you and your passenger agree that the service was great, then you can
favorite each other.  This is the start
of you building your client base!  As
your client base grows, then you will get priority booking for your
clients.  When they request rides and
you are in their area, you will get matched first.  You will also appear on the top of their list
for scheduled rides.  You can set your
own prices so you can maximize your profits. 
There is also a built in tipping system and that is all yours as well.

Limo/Taxi Services:

Panaroamer gives Limo and Taxi services the same benefits of
most ride share systems, but with some added features.  As a dispatcher, you can see where your
drivers are at any point.  They can
contact you if there are any problems, like if they get a flat tire or have to
stop for gas.  The dispatcher can also
maintain communication with the customers to keep them apprised of the driver’s
location and estimated time of arrival. 
You can also keep track of your drivers and how they are doing with the
built in review system.Retailers:
If you are a retailer, Panaroamer offers you a unique targeted
advertising system that will change the way you communicate with potential
consumers.  It allows you to send any type of message to a customer in or
near your store based on what they are interested in purchasing.  This
will increase your opportunities to engage your customers and increase your
opportunity to close a sale by offering special enticements.  These deals can be unique to a specific
customer, to a specific product, to everyone, to everything.  To find out
more details and information on this section, please contact us at info@panaroamer.com.


Private Contractors (Plumbers, Electricians, etc.)

As a private contractor, Panaroamer can help you manage your
employees, establish a client base, and communicate with current
customers.  Panaroamer allows you to
instant message your clients to inform them of when you will arrive.  You can optionally share your location so
they know you are on the way.  You will
be able to also know where your employees are at any time and communicate with
them instantly.  With our messaging
service, you send a single message to all of your field workers.  This will help you maintain their locations
and their work time.  Panaroamer will
also save and store client information and build up your rolodex of customers.  

Dating and People Connection:

For those of you that are looking to find that special
person or to just hang out with someone new, Panaroamer allows you to connect
to anyone around you.  This, of course,
assumes that both of you have similar interests and choose to connect.  You can ignore those requests that do not
meet your expectations and chat with those that do.  You can also send private messages, images,
or videos that can automatically be deleted after the person views it.

If you are new to town and just want to watch a game at a
local bar, Panaroamer can connect you with others that have the same
interests.  With our Quick Connect
feature, you can join conversations or start your own conversation on any topic
you choose.
Developer: 

We need developers to come join our community and start
creating your own applications.  You can
devote your energy and efforts on your ideas, we’ll provide you with the
technology.  If you have a game that
needs the ability to connect players, we have the solution.  If you want to integrate instant messaging
into your workout application, we have you covered.  If you need to add rich in depth analytics
to your web services, we’ve done all of the heavy lifting.  We will assist you in implementing our APIs
to provide a seamless service to your users all in a secure environment that
only you can access.
We also need developers to help design new features and
improve on current features.  Panaroamer
is designed to be a community that grows together.  We are excited to provide a platform with
limitless possibilities.
So come join us, and we will help you make your ideas a
reality.

Who
We Are
We are a Delaware Incorporated
company that consist of an enthusiastic team of technically savvy
entrepreneurs with more than 40 years of applied experience in startups, mobile,
database, cloud, internetworking, and telecommunications technologies.  We
have strong relationships within the software industry and can attract
top-level talent.The
Impact
As a team we have been working on
this project for more than two years and we are about four months from launching our ride share solution. We believe that once the public sees the power of our platform on the ride
share side, we can then expose them to other products in the Panaroamer suite. 
Our primary goal is to assist people
in creating their own businesses, starting with a ride share business. For
those already running their own businesses, we want to help them to better
connect to new and current customers. Our system supports targeted ads that can
reach anyone in the community who indicates a similar interest. You get access
to our unique ride share system by way of features not available in any other
rideshare system. You set your rates, you earn and keep your tips, you grow
your client base, and you set your own schedules. Partner up with your friends
and build your own rideshare corporation. The best part is that budgeting is
easy. One monthly fee is all it takes!  What
We Need & What You Get
We are looking for funding to help
our team focus solely on this project.  We will be strengthening our
engineering team and infrastructure. The team will focus on completing the ride share solution.  We will then start building out our other solutions while continuing to update and improve our rideshare solution.  Additionally, we will add
some new team members to assist with marketing and business development. We
will also build a superior customer support team. Our community will grow by
and for our users. As such, we will do everything possible to make sure they
have the best experience possible.  
We are offering special perks to
those who want to support us in our endeavor to challenge the status quo. For
our friends with the entrepreneurial spirit, we are offering a perk that could
open up some amazing possibilities. The first 5000 drivers that donate $1000
will receive lifetime access to our ride share services. You will never pay us
another cent to use our system. No revenue splitting, no additional monthly
fees!
For those that want to try it out
for a few months, we are offering two free months of ride share if you prepay
for the first month.
Other
Ways You Can Help

5 Things About MATCH + LIGHT:

We’re a mother-daughter team on a mission to DO GOOD with candles. 
Each month, we release a limited edition candle that SUPPORTS A CAUSE.
The first series of candles will support a cause we care about. CANCER. 
The next series will support a cause YOU care about. 
Each candle features artwork from INDEPENDENT ARTISTS, hand-poured using the highest quality sustainable ingredients.
Our Goal:We are ready to shed some light on cancer. We have sourced all our materials locally and the fragrance has been tested. Now we just need $5k to fund the production of the first series of Match + Light candles to support cancer.

We took the money typically wasted on a fancy box and reinvested that into a custom satin black glass that is reusable so it's better for the environment. 
Each candle, features artwork from independent artists because we believe that beautiful art sparks conversation.
The candle itself is made from a natural soy wax and is double the size of the average candle you typically buy in a boutique store.

<h2><b>Why I became interested in helping orphan children in Thailand.</b></h2>
<p>A Thai lady in the Northern part of Thailand that turned her small house into an orphanage, was telling the story of how one little girl became a homeless orphan.  It was one of the saddest stories I had ever heard.</p>
<p>The little 6 year old Thai girl was found in a small village in North Thailand, close to the boarder of Myanmar.  She was found walking aimlessly down the street hungry and confused. </p>
<p>Her father, which was the only income provider, was killed a few months earlier.  Her mother, which was her only family left,  had died in her bed from of a sickness (because of no medical treatment) 7 days prior of finding the little girl. </p>
<p>When her mother died, the little girl, not knowing what to do, left the hut and started walking down the street. </p>
<p>She had been wondering on the streets for several days, before she was found and brought to the orphanage.  After being fed and cared for by the orphanage, the little girl regained her strength and survived.</p>
<p>After hearing the little girls story, I realized how important these small orphanages are to children that need emergency help.  Often, these small house orphanages don’t have much financial help and rely on the local Thai people, which are usually poor themselves.</p>
<h2><b>My Thailand experience.</b></h2>
<p>I was born and raised in the USA. At age 54 (5 years ago), I moved to Thailand and </p>
<p>volunteered <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">as an English language teacher. </span></p>
<p>Although, Thailand is called the land of Smiles and is a wonderful tourists destination, many Thai children have yet experienced a smile.  As I explored the less traveled areas of Thailand, I saw many heart breaking situations that changed my life.  </p>
<p>There are many challenges that Thai children are born into.  Just like there parents were born into, and the generation before them were born into. </p>
<p>Some of the challenges for the children are so overwhelming, that outside help is the only way to break the cycle of failure, poverty, and hopelessness.</p>
<p>Sometimes, normal childhood experiences and basic education are often taken from the children of poor families.</p>
<p>One day, I stopped to have lunch in a small restaurant about 20 miles north of Bangkok.  I was surprised when a 12 year old girl took my order.  It was in the afternoon durning school hours. </p>
<p>I ask the lady restaurant owner why the little girl was not in school. She told me the little girls story of the hard times that her mother &amp; father were going through.  They had came across the border from Cambodia into Thailand, trying to start a new life.  The 12 year old girl had approached her looking for work to help buy food for the family.</p>
<p>The lady restaurant owner told me it was very difficult for her to hire the little girl because, she had a young daughter the same age.  She continued to explain to me, that by hiring the little girl, she could watch her and keep her safe from the sex trade and other things that could be harmful to her.  </p>
<p>I was hurtful to see the little girl working full time at 12 years old.  Knowing that her childhood and school education was over and the responsibilities of an adult life had begun. </p>
<p>In my mind, I ask myself, ‘How can I make this world better?  The only answer I came up with is, changing one child’s life... is a good place to start.</p>

Please help our Challenge to buy hypoallergenic powdered milk, fresh food, and safe mattresses that properly fit the crib.


I will personally buy the powdered milk, food, and mattresses and bring them to the children. By doing it this way, we know the children benefit from your gifts and support. I will also send photos and a personal thank you email to everyone for you help and support.
This is a fundraiser for the FRIENDS FOR ALL CHILDREN FOUNDATION.The children at this orphanage have a very special need. 

There are about 30 orphan children.  Their ages range from 1 to 3 years old. They are in 3 small houses, with about 10 children in each house.



I asked Saovanee (the director of the orphanage), ""What do the children need the most?'Her reply was, ‘The children need hypoallergenic powdered milk and fresh food.’


I also noticed that the mattresses in the cribs were too small.  Sometimes, the babies roll off the mattress and get stuck between the mattress and the steel bars. This is potential hazardous!


If enough money is raised, I would like to buy the proper size mattresses for the cribs.  It would make the cribs a lot safer for the babies.

Only with your help will this fundraiser be successful!
Your giving and support makes a difference to these children.  Also, please help by sharing this on your Facebook and other social media.More exposure will help us reach our goal!Thank you for helping the children.

<p>My name is Frank Swai born
and raised in Roo village, Hai district in Kilimanjaro region Tanzania. I got a
chance to get my first degree of ""Bachelor of science in Hospitality and
Tourism management “at Tumaini University at Stefano branch in Moshi Memorial
University College. After completing my studies, i shifted to Arusha the famous
tourist region in Tanzania. I have been doing part time tourists jobs in
Arusha. I have now decided to totally live in this region as it is part of my
focused career in self-development and the society.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446666029/f9amhfhxk2w32kf8dhww.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><b>Map of Tanzania showing tourists attractions</b></i></p>
<p><b>MY
CAMPAIGN AND WHY IT IS IMPORTANT</b></p>
<p>  While still studying, I tried to think much
on what to do after my studies because it is difficult to get employment
opportunities as there are few chances compared to applicants. So i decided to
start my small tourists company in which i can deal with tourists who visits
Tanzania in the National parks and the highest mountain in Africa, Mount
Kilimanjaro. Commencing a tourists company is very expensive if someone lacks
sponsors. As the things necessary needed to start the company is having enough
vehicles to carry tourists, Insurance, Workers, license. I have created a
website that has enough information about Tanzania’s tourism business. All i
requires now is to advertise my company, registration for my company, buying
some vehicles which I required to have so as to be considered and qualify for
registration  for which is very
expensive. What I can ask from you is your support and assistance in making my
business prosper.</p>
<p>The importance of this campaign;</p>
<p><b>1. 
</b>  The tourists that i will
bring in Tanzania will lift the nation's economy through giving foreign
currencies.</p>
<p><b>2. 
</b>My society will be developed
through employment opportunities given by my company.</p>
<p><b>3. 
</b>Hotels and Lodges will earn income
as tourists prefer living in hotels during their visits in Tanzania.</p>
<p><b>4. 
</b>Many tourists like doing cultural
programs, so even orphanage centers will be benefited by my company.</p>
<p><b>5. 
</b>The business will also intensify
International relationship of Tanzania with other nations.</p>
<p><b>6. 
</b>My tourism business also stimulate
the growth of other sector such as agriculture, many tourists likes to learn
about agriculture in Tanzania when they come for a visit, taste the Tanzanian
food which are traditional made.</p>

risks and challenges starting this business;</p>

your hotel. Should you arrive prior to day one, pre-tour accommodation can be
arranged and you will be picked up from your hotel on the morning of day. </p>
<p>In the
evening of first day of your safari, there will be a pre-departure meeting
presented by your guide at your accommodation. It is imperative that all
clients attend this meeting so as not to miss out on any critical information.</p>
<p>Whilst it is
our every intention to adhere to the above mentioned itinerary, there may on
occasion be a necessity to make alterations in order to make the tour more
enjoyable or practical.  Therefore please
treat the itinerary as a guide only.</p>
<p><b><u>Transport</u></b></p>
<p>Steppe Dogs

<p><b><u>Detailed Information on Areas Visited</u></b></p>
<p><b>Tanzania</b></p>
<p>A land of
plains, lakes and mountains, with a narrow, low-lying coastal belt, Tanzania is
East Africa's largest country and also one of its most diverse.  Tanzania is home for more than 100 different
ethnic groups, mostly of Bantu origin, each with its own language and customs. </p>
<p>Tanzania has
one of the largest and wildest animal populations in the world.  Wildebeest, monkey, antelope, lion, cheetah,
crocodile, gazelle, and flamingo - you name them. Blessed with some of the
world's largest game reserves, the country also has one of the highest
concentrations of elephant, buffalo, hippo, wild dog and chimpanzee.</p>
<p>Its
spectacular topography includes The Great Rift Valley, Mt Kilimanjaro and
famous parks such as the Serengeti and the wonderful Ngorongoro Crater.</p>
<p>Offshore are
idyllic islands with beautiful palm-fringed beaches and turquoise seas that
surround pristine coral reefs.  The
archaeological treasures of Tanzania include hominid fossils, which are more
than 300 million years old.  Tanzanian
music and dance dominates much of East Africa. 
Strong in rhythm and renowned for hard-hitting lyrics, the country's
Swahili-based sounds are kept very much alive by a thriving dance-band
scene.  <i>Nyama choma</i> (barbecued
meat) has taken over in a big way, especially in restaurants with attached
bars.  But on the coast, on Zanzibar and
Pemba islands, there's a decent range of traditional Swahili dishes based on
seafood.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446807782/xjeqpdewob4gniezt46s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Recorded
history begins around 1800, when the Masai warrior tribes were migrating from
Kenya to Tanzania.  It wasn't until the
middle of the 18th century that Arab traders and slaves dared venture into
Masai territory in the country's wild interior. 
European explorers began arriving in earnest in the mid-19th century,
the most famous being Stanley and Livingstone. 
The famous phrase ‘Dr Livingstone, I presume’, stems from the duo's
meeting at Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika. Tanganyika won independence in 1961 with
Julius Nyerere as the country's first president. Nyerere, whose secret
ingredient was radical socialism, gained widespread respect and is seen as one
of the most influential leaders Africa has ever had.  Zanzibar was stuck for another two years,
after which the mainland forged a union comprising Zanzibar and the nearby
island of Pemba. Thus Tanzania was born.</p>
<p>There is a
wide range of optional activities to make your experience in Tanzania
absolutely unforgettable.  Some great
views can be experienced while floating in a hot-air balloon over the
Serengeti.  While swimming with dolphins
is all the rage on the island of Zanzibar. 
Snorkelling and scuba diving is equally popular due to the world-class
coral reefs off nearby Pemba and Mafia</p>
<p><b><u>Tarangire National Park</u></b></p>
<p>The Tarangire
National Park covers 2,600km² and habits the highest concentration of wildlife
outside the Serengeti ecosystem. Here, you can watch huge herds of wildebeest,
eland, zebra, buffalo, impala, gazelle and elephant moving through the
undulating countryside and taking a rest under a vast number of baobab trees,
or drinking at the lagoons and the rivers. Remember not to just look on the
ground though, but have a look at the branches of the trees for lion, leopard
and pythons or the amazing 550 bird species also found in this area.</p>

<p><b><u>Lake Manyara National Park:</u></b></p>
<p>Lake Manyara
National Park sits at the base of the Great Rift Valley escarpment and is one
of the most scenic parks in Tanzania. There are stunning views of the park from
every direction. From the east, the Rift Valley escarpment emerges on the
horizon with the lake forming a glistening background. On the southern side of
the park, you will find the hot springs of Maji Moto, which are about 60ºC. At
the top of the escarpment from the west, the park stretches across a ribbon of
green with the lake shining in the sun. Like most Rift Valley lakes, the water
is alkaline. This attracts vast flocks of flamingos, which form pink foam
against a silver background of water. Altogether, this area offers beautiful
views as you take in the massive lake with its silver shimmer and surrounding
vegetation.</p>
<p>The major
landmark is the spectacular rift wall, where the plains give way to cultivated
uplands of Mbululand. Measuring only 330km<sup>2</sup> (of which the lake
occupies 230km<sup>2)</sup> and located only 130km from Arusha, this park often
gets day visitors, who come to enjoy the endless views and variety of mammals,
reptiles and birds, as well as the varied vegetation, flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Animals found
in the area include zebra, elephant, hippo, monkey, wildebeest (gnu),
waterbuck, warthog, gazelle, impala, buffalo, warthog, hyena, baboon and
giraffe. Manyara is also known for its tree-climbing lions. These majestic
animals find shelter from the heat and biting flies in the branches of trees
and can easily kill buffalo, which is far greater in weight and size. There are
also over 350 species of bird life, with a variety of local species inhabiting
the forest and bush, including pelicans that waddle around next to short
grasses on the shore of the lake.</p>
<p><b><u>Serengeti National Park:</u></b></p>
<p>Serengeti,
which sprawls across 14.763 km<sup>2</sup> (5.757 miles<sup>2</sup>), is
Tanzania’s largest and most famous national park. The chief herbivore of
Serengeti is the wildebeest (gnu) of which there are up to two million. The
amazing annual migration of wildebeest herds is one of the biggest attractions
of the Serengeti. It begins at the Serengeti National Park near the Kenyan
border, when huge herds of these animals, head for greener pastures in
Kenya.  Starting in April each year, they
migrate across the Serengeti's southern plains accompanied by zebra, antelope,
gazelle, lion and tourists! The park is also famous for its lions, which can be
tracked due to the fact that many have collars fitted with transmitters, as
well as cheetah and large herds of giraffe.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><b><u>Ngorongoro Conservation Area:</u></b></p>
<p>Being one of
the largest calderas in the world, 20 km (12.4 miles)-wide, 600 m (1.968ft)
tall, with a variety of animals and vegetation, Ngorongoro Crater is one of
Tanzania’s most visited areas. The vegetation includes grasslands, swamps,
forests, salt-pans, as well as a freshwater lake and has been compared to
Noah's Ark or the Garden of Eden.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446806729/y7j8ahtwpt8dwfbwntrg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>You will have
no trouble finding lion, elephant, rhino, buffalo and many of the plains
herbivores such as wildebeest (gnu), Thomson's gazelle, zebra and reedbuck, as
well as thousands of flamingos wading in the shallows of Lake Magadi, the soda
lake on the floor of the crater. Within the steep walls of the crater you will
find considerable movement of animals and you may well come across local Masai
tribesmen (who have grazing rights here), tending their cattle.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>The Maasai of Tanzania are an indigenous pastoral society with a
rich and vibrant oral history.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maasai</strong></p>
<p>Their traditional knowledge, often narrated in the form of
folktales, songs, stories, poetry, and chants, contains a wide-range of
knowledge about traditional medicine, grazing practices, landscape ecology, the
behavior of animals, livestock management, and the gathering of wild plant
foods. </p>
<p>Maasai pastoralists represent the highest degree of pastoral
specialization in the Eastern-Sudanic region of East Africa. Maasai peoples,
however, also combine livestock herding with other economic activities such as
cultivation, trade, and gathering. Because of their dependence on natural
resources to sustain livestock and human populations (such as natural watering
sites, grazing areas, agricultural land, and drought reserves), many Maasai
groups that historically depended on community grazing structures and local,
opportunistic agriculture suffered economically when they were forced onto
smaller parcels of settled land. This conflict arose as colonial, and later
local governments began instituting land reform programs that transformed
Maasai lands in Kenya and Tanzania into group ranches, privatized settler
farms, national parks, game reserves, and hunting areas. In 1911, Maasai lands
in Kenya were reduced by 60 percent when the British evicted them to make room
for settler ranches, subsequently confining them to present-day Kajiado and
Narok districts. Maasai lands were further enclosed to allow for the creation
of game parks, including Amboseli, Nairobi, and Masai Mara in Kenya and the
Serengeti/Ngorongoro Conservation Area in Tanzania. Ndagala states that were
the colonial and post-colonial eviction of the pastoralists from some of their
best grazing lands were rationalized to protect the wildlife. The transfer of
these lands has served to enclose many pastoral and semi agricultural groups
onto parcels of lands that are unsuitable for either semi-nomadic pastoralism
or agriculture at a sustainable level. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446806969/e1nasgdmxxvtf7fzdix1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<i><b>Maasai woman showing hospitality to her visitor by covering her by Maasai shuka. Support us and will send you one shuka</b></i>.</div>
<div>After independence, Tanzania implemented a socialist policy of
villagazation, a program to promote sustainability, development, and
nationalism. In Maasai areas, this meant that people were physically resettled
into bomas, a circular cluster of homes. The bomas, which were formerly kin
settlements, were now neighborly groupings of individual families. In 1976, the
government officially resettled the Maasai in Monduli and gave them a maximum
of three acres of land each to farm (Ndagala: 1982). Whereas the Maasai
previously thought of grazing fields as a community resource (Ndagala 1992),
each family now owned its own plot of land. In the shift to a more sedentary
lifestyle, the Maasai in Monduli Juu became a pastoralist community where they
cultivated both maize and beans and kept extensive herds of livestock. In this
sense, they were likened to ilmeek, outsiders or non-Maasai, whom they had
formerly despised because they did not value grass, a significant source of
life for pastoralists (Galaty 1981:4; Hodgson 1999). In the words of one woman
in Eluai Village, “There used to be so many cows that the grass would not reach
the door of the house; now there is [unused] grass everywhere.” <br/>

<i><b>Dance with Maasai tribe, see their unique house building and learn their ways of life from their elders!</b></i><br/>
</div>
<div>This subsequently placed the Maasai at odds with their
environment, both culturally and economically. Without livestock, a Maasai male
is presented with many difficulties. These difficulties include the inability
to obtain sufficient food, lack of money to buy grains, inability to put up a
good house, and if unmarried, he may not be able to attract a wife. Thus, the
privatization of land ultimately increased the relative poverty of those living
in Eluai and led to a more individualistic view of maintaining the environment.
Instead of protecting the communal character of grazing lands, those who
cultivated farms destroyed grass; an act seen as an aggression against Engai.
As a result, trees, which were formerly regarded as objects of refuge, ritual,
and healing, became capital to be owned and used or sold in the same way
livestock once was, by whoever held the land they grew on. <br/>

</div></div>","MY  BACKGROUND
My name is Frank Swai born
and raised in Roo village, Hai district in Kilimanjaro region Tanzania. I got a
chance to get my first degree of ""Bachelor of science in Hospitality and
Tourism management “at Tumaini University at Stefano branch in Moshi Memorial
University College. After completing my studies, i shifted to Arusha the famous
tourist region in Tanzania. I have been doing part time tourists jobs in
Arusha. I have now decided to totally live in this region as it is part of my
focused career in self-development and the society.

MY
CAMPAIGN AND WHY IT IS IMPORTANT
  While still studying, I tried to think much
on what to do after my studies because it is difficult to get employment
opportunities as there are few chances compared to applicants. So i decided to
start my small tourists company in which i can deal with tourists who visits
Tanzania in the National parks and the highest mountain in Africa, Mount
Kilimanjaro. Commencing a tourists company is very expensive if someone lacks
sponsors. As the things necessary needed to start the company is having enough
vehicles to carry tourists, Insurance, Workers, license. I have created a
website that has enough information about Tanzania’s tourism business. All i
requires now is to advertise my company, registration for my company, buying
some vehicles which I required to have so as to be considered and qualify for
registration  for which is very
expensive. What I can ask from you is your support and assistance in making my
business prosper.
The importance of this campaign;
1. 
  The tourists that i will
bring in Tanzania will lift the nation's economy through giving foreign
currencies.
2. 
My society will be developed
through employment opportunities given by my company.
3. 
Hotels and Lodges will earn income
as tourists prefer living in hotels during their visits in Tanzania.
4. 
Many tourists like doing cultural
programs, so even orphanage centers will be benefited by my company.
5. 
The business will also intensify
International relationship of Tanzania with other nations.
6. 
My tourism business also stimulate
the growth of other sector such as agriculture, many tourists likes to learn
about agriculture in Tanzania when they come for a visit, taste the Tanzanian
food which are traditional made.

REASONS
AS TO WHY MY PROJECT IS VALUABLE TO DONORS AND THE WORLD
This project is very essential to donors and the
World at large, as it will intensify International relationship between
Tanzania and the tourists who will visit our country. But even sponsors will
get time to visit and witness Tanzanian tourist’s attractions.
RISKS
AND CHALLENGES
The following are the
risks and challenges starting this business;
1.  The
tourism business is very competitive Worldwide and more effort is needed to
master this.
2.  Language
barrier is another challenge, as for different nations use different languages
like French, English, German, Italian, Japanese, and Chinese among other
languages.
3.  Another
challenge is how to get partners or agents who would support the business.
4.  Vehicles
for transporting tourists.
5.  Advertisement
is very expensive.
6.  Open
and starting a company isn’t so easy as it needs many things to have so as to
be considered for registration; license to carry tourists, insurance, enough
vehicles which must be 5. 

7. Camping equipments is also challenging us.

HOW
TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES
The following are the ways on how to overcome the
challenges;
1. 
Attracting tourists and creating
unique packages that other companies do not have. But also giving the best
services to tourists who in return help in advertising the company.
2. 
Searching for agents in every
country that has a targeted market so as to help in good language to tourists.
3. 
I will also encourage people from
different companies to bring their tourists through my company as i will be
having enough facilities.
4. 
After winning this campaign, I will
be able to have enough cars for transporting tourists.
5. 
This campaign will also advertise
my company Worldwide.
6. Your support will help me to buy enough camping equipment s.

Pre – departure
information
Departure
The Tanzania
Wildlife Safaris departs from the African Tulip Hotel in Arusha. When arriving
in Arusha on day one, you will be picked up from the airport and transferred to
your hotel. Should you arrive prior to day one, pre-tour accommodation can be
arranged and you will be picked up from your hotel on the morning of day. 
In the
evening of first day of your safari, there will be a pre-departure meeting
presented by your guide at your accommodation. It is imperative that all
clients attend this meeting so as not to miss out on any critical information.
Whilst it is
our every intention to adhere to the above mentioned itinerary, there may on
occasion be a necessity to make alterations in order to make the tour more
enjoyable or practical.  Therefore please
treat the itinerary as a guide only.
Transport
Steppe Dogs
Adventures uses fully equipped customized 8-seater 4x4 safari vehicles, Toyota
Land Cruisers or other appropriate vehicles with comfortable seating, large
windows for game viewing and a music system. The vehicles are fully
air-conditioned and equipped with pop-up roofs to facilitate the best game
viewing. All luggages, besides hand luggage and photo equipment, are carried on
the vehicle roof rack to ensure maximum comfort in the vehicle.
Traveling Times & Distances
All
travelling times are affected by road conditions, border crossings, detours and
weather conditions, therefore on certain days travelling times may be longer
than anticipated especially where there is a lot of distance to be covered. 
Please keep in mind that the time it takes to travel 100 km in your home
country is not equivalent to the time it takes to travel 100 km on African
roads, therefore we encourage you to sit
back and enjoy the spectacular scenery Africa has to offer.  Where
possible additional stops will be made to ensure you’re travelling comfort at
all times.

Accommodation
We make use of designated
campsites, either within a National Park or on the banks of a river, or other
places of interest. All campsites have shared ablution facilities with showers,
flushing toilets and running water (unless otherwise specified in the detailed
itinerary). Steppe Dogs Adventures tries to avoid crowded campsites and brings
you to secluded spots, often supported by the local community. We make use of
3-person dome tents with the following measurements: 2.5 m x 2. 5 m x 1.8 m and
accommodate two clients per tent. All tents are fitted with mosquito-screed
windows and doors. In addition, we provide 5 cm thick sleeping mattresses.
Sleeping bags can be hired at an additional fee of US$ 30 per sleeping bag for
the entire tour.

For the lodge safari, we make use of typical, mid-range African
standard lodge accommodation. Accommodation is situated either in national parks,
on the banks of a river, or in other places of interest. The accommodation will
be a mix of lodges, chalets and tented camps, all with en-suite facilities.
Some properties are equipped with swimming pools and/or bar areas.

Spending money
Clients are
advised to bring enough money to cover the purchase of curios, tips for the
guide and additional entertainment. US Dollars and Tanzanian Shilling are the
most practical and convenient currencies.
Meals
All meals
will be prepared by your guide, either around a campfire in the evening or at a
picnic site for lunch. Please advise us of any special dietary requirements in
advance.
First Aid Kit
Our guides
are trained in basic first aid and the vehicle is equipped with a medical aid
kit. Preventative Malaria medication should be taken before the trip and
throughout its duration and it is advisable to consult a doctor prior to
departure. Yellow Fever vaccinations are compulsory – please contact your
Travel Clinic before departure.

Luggage: 
Maximum baggage allowance: 12 kg. Steppe Dogs Adventures Tanzania
stipulates this luggage allowance, as an overloaded vehicle is a danger to both
the clients and the guide. This does not include photographic equipment and a
small daypack. Please bring soft-sided luggage (e.g. a backpack or soft barrel
bag), not a suitcase. Don't bring too much clothing, as there are washing
opportunities along the way. Please adhere to the allowance specified as space
for luggage is limited.
Insurance:
It is compulsory for all travellers to have insurance covering
their personal requirements, medical expenses and personal possessions. This is
to be arranged before leaving your home country. Steppe Dogs Adventures has
comprehensive public liability insurance.

Detailed Information on Areas Visited
Tanzania
A land of
plains, lakes and mountains, with a narrow, low-lying coastal belt, Tanzania is
East Africa's largest country and also one of its most diverse.  Tanzania is home for more than 100 different
ethnic groups, mostly of Bantu origin, each with its own language and customs. 
Tanzania has
one of the largest and wildest animal populations in the world.  Wildebeest, monkey, antelope, lion, cheetah,
crocodile, gazelle, and flamingo - you name them. Blessed with some of the
world's largest game reserves, the country also has one of the highest
concentrations of elephant, buffalo, hippo, wild dog and chimpanzee.
Its
spectacular topography includes The Great Rift Valley, Mt Kilimanjaro and
famous parks such as the Serengeti and the wonderful Ngorongoro Crater.
Offshore are
idyllic islands with beautiful palm-fringed beaches and turquoise seas that
surround pristine coral reefs.  The
archaeological treasures of Tanzania include hominid fossils, which are more
than 300 million years old.  Tanzanian
music and dance dominates much of East Africa. 
Strong in rhythm and renowned for hard-hitting lyrics, the country's
Swahili-based sounds are kept very much alive by a thriving dance-band
scene.  Nyama choma (barbecued
meat) has taken over in a big way, especially in restaurants with attached
bars.  But on the coast, on Zanzibar and
Pemba islands, there's a decent range of traditional Swahili dishes based on
seafood.



Recorded
history begins around 1800, when the Masai warrior tribes were migrating from
Kenya to Tanzania.  It wasn't until the
middle of the 18th century that Arab traders and slaves dared venture into
Masai territory in the country's wild interior. 
European explorers began arriving in earnest in the mid-19th century,
the most famous being Stanley and Livingstone. 
The famous phrase ‘Dr Livingstone, I presume’, stems from the duo's
meeting at Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika. Tanganyika won independence in 1961 with
Julius Nyerere as the country's first president. Nyerere, whose secret
ingredient was radical socialism, gained widespread respect and is seen as one
of the most influential leaders Africa has ever had.  Zanzibar was stuck for another two years,
after which the mainland forged a union comprising Zanzibar and the nearby
island of Pemba. Thus Tanzania was born.
There is a
wide range of optional activities to make your experience in Tanzania
absolutely unforgettable.  Some great
views can be experienced while floating in a hot-air balloon over the
Serengeti.  While swimming with dolphins
is all the rage on the island of Zanzibar. 
Snorkelling and scuba diving is equally popular due to the world-class
coral reefs off nearby Pemba and Mafia
Tarangire National Park
The Tarangire
National Park covers 2,600km² and habits the highest concentration of wildlife
outside the Serengeti ecosystem. Here, you can watch huge herds of wildebeest,
eland, zebra, buffalo, impala, gazelle and elephant moving through the
undulating countryside and taking a rest under a vast number of baobab trees,
or drinking at the lagoons and the rivers. Remember not to just look on the
ground though, but have a look at the branches of the trees for lion, leopard
and pythons or the amazing 550 bird species also found in this area.


Lake Manyara National Park:
Lake Manyara
National Park sits at the base of the Great Rift Valley escarpment and is one
of the most scenic parks in Tanzania. There are stunning views of the park from
every direction. From the east, the Rift Valley escarpment emerges on the
horizon with the lake forming a glistening background. On the southern side of
the park, you will find the hot springs of Maji Moto, which are about 60ºC. At
the top of the escarpment from the west, the park stretches across a ribbon of
green with the lake shining in the sun. Like most Rift Valley lakes, the water
is alkaline. This attracts vast flocks of flamingos, which form pink foam
against a silver background of water. Altogether, this area offers beautiful
views as you take in the massive lake with its silver shimmer and surrounding
vegetation.
The major
landmark is the spectacular rift wall, where the plains give way to cultivated
uplands of Mbululand. Measuring only 330km2 (of which the lake
occupies 230km2) and located only 130km from Arusha, this park often
gets day visitors, who come to enjoy the endless views and variety of mammals,
reptiles and birds, as well as the varied vegetation, flora and fauna.
Animals found
in the area include zebra, elephant, hippo, monkey, wildebeest (gnu),
waterbuck, warthog, gazelle, impala, buffalo, warthog, hyena, baboon and
giraffe. Manyara is also known for its tree-climbing lions. These majestic
animals find shelter from the heat and biting flies in the branches of trees
and can easily kill buffalo, which is far greater in weight and size. There are
also over 350 species of bird life, with a variety of local species inhabiting
the forest and bush, including pelicans that waddle around next to short
grasses on the shore of the lake.
Serengeti National Park:
Serengeti,
which sprawls across 14.763 km2 (5.757 miles2), is
Tanzania’s largest and most famous national park. The chief herbivore of
Serengeti is the wildebeest (gnu) of which there are up to two million. The
amazing annual migration of wildebeest herds is one of the biggest attractions
of the Serengeti. It begins at the Serengeti National Park near the Kenyan
border, when huge herds of these animals, head for greener pastures in
Kenya.  Starting in April each year, they
migrate across the Serengeti's southern plains accompanied by zebra, antelope,
gazelle, lion and tourists! The park is also famous for its lions, which can be
tracked due to the fact that many have collars fitted with transmitters, as
well as cheetah and large herds of giraffe.


Ngorongoro Conservation Area:
Being one of
the largest calderas in the world, 20 km (12.4 miles)-wide, 600 m (1.968ft)
tall, with a variety of animals and vegetation, Ngorongoro Crater is one of
Tanzania’s most visited areas. The vegetation includes grasslands, swamps,
forests, salt-pans, as well as a freshwater lake and has been compared to
Noah's Ark or the Garden of Eden.  



You will have
no trouble finding lion, elephant, rhino, buffalo and many of the plains
herbivores such as wildebeest (gnu), Thomson's gazelle, zebra and reedbuck, as
well as thousands of flamingos wading in the shallows of Lake Magadi, the soda
lake on the floor of the crater. Within the steep walls of the crater you will
find considerable movement of animals and you may well come across local Masai
tribesmen (who have grazing rights here), tending their cattle.

Maasai at Ngorongoro 

The Maasai of Tanzania are an indigenous pastoral society with a
rich and vibrant oral history.
Maasai
Their traditional knowledge, often narrated in the form of
folktales, songs, stories, poetry, and chants, contains a wide-range of
knowledge about traditional medicine, grazing practices, landscape ecology, the
behavior of animals, livestock management, and the gathering of wild plant
foods. 
Maasai pastoralists represent the highest degree of pastoral
specialization in the Eastern-Sudanic region of East Africa. Maasai peoples,
however, also combine livestock herding with other economic activities such as
cultivation, trade, and gathering. Because of their dependence on natural
resources to sustain livestock and human populations (such as natural watering
sites, grazing areas, agricultural land, and drought reserves), many Maasai
groups that historically depended on community grazing structures and local,
opportunistic agriculture suffered economically when they were forced onto
smaller parcels of settled land. This conflict arose as colonial, and later
local governments began instituting land reform programs that transformed
Maasai lands in Kenya and Tanzania into group ranches, privatized settler
farms, national parks, game reserves, and hunting areas. In 1911, Maasai lands
in Kenya were reduced by 60 percent when the British evicted them to make room
for settler ranches, subsequently confining them to present-day Kajiado and
Narok districts. Maasai lands were further enclosed to allow for the creation
of game parks, including Amboseli, Nairobi, and Masai Mara in Kenya and the
Serengeti/Ngorongoro Conservation Area in Tanzania. Ndagala states that were
the colonial and post-colonial eviction of the pastoralists from some of their
best grazing lands were rationalized to protect the wildlife. The transfer of
these lands has served to enclose many pastoral and semi agricultural groups
onto parcels of lands that are unsuitable for either semi-nomadic pastoralism
or agriculture at a sustainable level.

After independence, Tanzania implemented a socialist policy of
villagazation, a program to promote sustainability, development, and
nationalism. In Maasai areas, this meant that people were physically resettled
into bomas, a circular cluster of homes. The bomas, which were formerly kin
settlements, were now neighborly groupings of individual families. In 1976, the
government officially resettled the Maasai in Monduli and gave them a maximum
of three acres of land each to farm (Ndagala: 1982). Whereas the Maasai
previously thought of grazing fields as a community resource (Ndagala 1992),
each family now owned its own plot of land. In the shift to a more sedentary
lifestyle, the Maasai in Monduli Juu became a pastoralist community where they
cultivated both maize and beans and kept extensive herds of livestock. In this
sense, they were likened to ilmeek, outsiders or non-Maasai, whom they had
formerly despised because they did not value grass, a significant source of
life for pastoralists (Galaty 1981:4; Hodgson 1999). In the words of one woman
in Eluai Village, “There used to be so many cows that the grass would not reach
the door of the house; now there is [unused] grass everywhere.” 





Dance with Maasai tribe, see their unique house building and learn their ways of life from their elders!

This subsequently placed the Maasai at odds with their
environment, both culturally and economically. Without livestock, a Maasai male
is presented with many difficulties. These difficulties include the inability
to obtain sufficient food, lack of money to buy grains, inability to put up a
good house, and if unmarried, he may not be able to attract a wife. Thus, the
privatization of land ultimately increased the relative poverty of those living
in Eluai and led to a more individualistic view of maintaining the environment.
Instead of protecting the communal character of grazing lands, those who
cultivated farms destroyed grass; an act seen as an aggression against Engai.
As a result, trees, which were formerly regarded as objects of refuge, ritual,
and healing, became capital to be owned and used or sold in the same way
livestock once was, by whoever held the land they grew on. 


1. Engai is the
Maasai name for God. In the Maasai language, en- is the feminine prefix and God
is associated with femininity; as a mother creator and protector of all natural
things.

<p>Hi, it's Michelle Trabelsi, as you know, I am the creator of Bootie Camp 
Yoga®, a power yoga based fitness program that sculpts the derriere!  I 
created Bootie Camp Yoga® 4 years ago
because my booty needed a little more than my ""Power, Flow &amp; 
Balance"" Yoga
practice had to offer.  I wanted to create a challenging work out that 
was
safe for those with injuries, like myself, that was completely 
kick-butt, and
that also offered deep stretching!</p>

This FUN hobby of mine has blossomed into a popular
&amp; nationally accredited fitness program that Las Vegas people call
<b>""Vegas's BEST Kept Secret""</b>.  Bootie Camp Yoga® is in over 15 gyms
 in
Southern California, 4 in Las Vegas, with certified instructors in 5 
other states, two of which were certified virtually!  To date, I have  
certified over 50 Bootie Camp Yoga® instructors &amp; trainees, 30 of 
which are actively teaching in both small &amp; well known fitness 
centers such as, Gold's Gym &amp; YMCA!<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454095960/sbx8t57mtec1cn0trjji.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Bootie Camp Yoga® has grown organically in a small area, and in a

Hi, it's Michelle Trabelsi, as you know, I am the creator of Bootie Camp 
Yoga®, a power yoga based fitness program that sculpts the derriere!  I 
created Bootie Camp Yoga® 4 years ago
because my booty needed a little more than my ""Power, Flow & 
Balance"" Yoga
practice had to offer.  I wanted to create a challenging work out that 
was
safe for those with injuries, like myself, that was completely 
kick-butt, and
that also offered deep stretching!

This FUN hobby of mine has blossomed into a popular
& nationally accredited fitness program that Las Vegas people call
""Vegas's BEST Kept Secret"".  Bootie Camp Yoga® is in over 15 gyms
 in
Southern California, 4 in Las Vegas, with certified instructors in 5 
other states, two of which were certified virtually!  To date, I have  
certified over 50 Bootie Camp Yoga® instructors & trainees, 30 of 
which are actively teaching in both small & well known fitness 
centers such as, Gold's Gym & YMCA!Bootie Camp Yoga® has grown organically in a small area, and in a 
relatively short amount of time.  I am at a place where instructors in 
other areas on the planet are not only SUPER interested in teaching this
 format, but also becoming master instructors in their area. THIS is EXCITING!  The fact that I can certify instructor's virtually is even more exciting!Bootie Camp Yoga® was voted BEST Recreational & Sporting Activity on Inland Empires 2014 HOT List, as well as we had our first feature story in a national publication: American Fitness Magazine, July/August 2015 issue.As the creator, It's an AMAZING feeling to hear people in the community and instructors SO excited about Bootie Camp Yoga®!

<p>In her personal and professional life, Jacqueline repeatedly witnessed how the immediate nature of health crisis kept people on a spinning wheel of uncertainty.  Clients and their loved ones, unfamiliar with health and aging systems experienced high degrees of confusion and anxiety, not sure where to turn, if they were making the right choices, and lacking knowledge of vital resources.  Without an advocate people would get lost in the system with multiple hospitalizations and poor care.  </p>
<p>For LGBTQI individuals, the process is often exponentially more harmful and traumatic.  Whether due to outright discrimination, prejudice, or ignorance of the concerns facing LGBTQI individuals, health &amp; aging providers often add pain to an already difficult process.  </p>

<p><b></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Short
Summary</b></p>
<ul><li>Nutrient dense, whole, and organic food has always been
     important to me. I have lived with Crohn’s disease for over 30 years, and
     finally had to evict a very diseased colon. I thought my dreams of continuing
     this farm were over for me and my husband, but to the contrary, that gave
     me freedom, strength, energy and stamina to build this farm and business
     and the will and perseverance to fight and survive.<span>  If I can keep one person healthy by
     offering farm fresh products, then everything I have experienced and
     learned is worth it. Its personal to me. Food should be personal, everyone
     should know where their food comes from, who is growing it, how it is
     grown and what is in it. </span>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>We
provide value to the world by having a small carbon footprint and providing
nutritious food grown using organic and permaculture practices. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>We
want our contributors to share in the idea that safe, natural, chemical free
products for the body and their home is the kind of forward thinking we need in
the 21st century. </li></ul>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p><b><i>How much money do we need?</i></b></p>
<p>We’ve identified three key areas to
focus our funding effort to expand our farm; facilities, equipment, and
start-up operational expenses. The total cost of the project is $97,000 and
breakout as follows:</p>
<ul><ul>
<li>Facilities:</li>
<ul>
<li>To reach the true potential of our farm and acreage,
       we need infrastructure. Animals will be contained with almost a mile of fencing,
       a new barn will be erected to shelter the herd to include attached
       milking stations and milk processing room, and a soap studio with retail
       space.</li>
<li>The soap studio, milking room, and milk processing
       room will be a steel structure built atop a concrete slab.</li>
<li>The barn will be a wooden structure.</li>
<li>We will relocate the current chicken coop and expand
       the flock to 200 birds. The relocation of the coop will provide the
       birds with an additional 2 acres of free range space from their current
       one acre of space. This will increase our egg production by ten times
       its current rate.</li>
<li>The facilities will be built to code and the milk
       processing room will be incompliance with USDA guidelines. The milk
       room, processing room, and soap studio will have full utilities as well
       as a separate septic tank rated for food production runoff and waste. </li>
</ul>
<li>Equipment:</li>
<ul>
<li>Equipment to support operations have been identified
       and resides almost entirely with the goat milk operation. Equipment
       includes (not entire list) milk cooler, milk pumping and vacuum system,
       stainless steel regulation sinks, birthing equipment, storage vats,
       shelves, farm tools, upgraded refrigeration equipment.</li>
<li>To expand our current beehive operation of three
       hives, five new hives will be purchased. Additionally, honey extraction
       equipment will be purchased. Currently we utilized the equipment from
       the local bee keepers’ association. </li>
</ul>
<li>Startup Operational Expenses:</li>
<ul><li>Startup operational expenses will include the
       purchase of fifteen goats “in milk”, five bee “nuks” with queens, additional
       chickens, straw and saw dust for the chickens, feed for both goats and
       chickens, vet care and animal medical supplies, supplies for bees,
       cleaning and sterilization equipment, fuel and diesel, initial utility
       connection expenses, and office supplies.</li></ul>

<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We acknowledge that every venture
has risk and have developed a risk management strategy to avoid or mitigate
those risk. It’s also important to note that some risk can exploit opportunity
and likewise, those too are tracked and assessed. We started by first
evaluating our own strengths and weaknesses, personally and as a business farm,
then market opportunities and threats. We table topped likely scenarios in each
function to operate our farm and identified potential risk in three key areas;
operational, business, and market. </p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449034964/simdouujwwplegkfg6vs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p>Potential risks are first qualified
by identifying “uncertainties” rather than “issues then annotated in our risk
register. These risk are then analyzed for their likelihood of occurrence and
consequential impact based on its effect on either cost, schedule, or
performance (quality). By doing so, the consequence of the risk occurring in
cost or time (or both) can then be calculated. We then determine the potential
“trigger”,
or conditions that create the risk and prepare
a mitigation plan. The mitigation plan will identify short and long-term
actions that will be taken to reduce or eliminate the risk or escalate the
opportunity. Mitigation sometimes come at a cost or schedule slip so we compare
the cost of risk against implementing mitigation actions to determine whether
we will avoid, eliminate, accept, or divert those risks.</p>

combined with Chuck’s education and experience, provides a holistic approach to
the way we run our business and our plans for goats in the future. Stephanie is
a Reiki Master, Holistic Health Coach and Practitioner, Registered
Aromatherapist and Licensed Esthetician. She has worked in the holistic health

<br/></div>","Short
Summary
Nutrient dense, whole, and organic food has always been
     important to me. I have lived with Crohn’s disease for over 30 years, and
     finally had to evict a very diseased colon. I thought my dreams of continuing
     this farm were over for me and my husband, but to the contrary, that gave
     me freedom, strength, energy and stamina to build this farm and business
     and the will and perseverance to fight and survive.  If I can keep one person healthy by
     offering farm fresh products, then everything I have experienced and
     learned is worth it. Its personal to me. Food should be personal, everyone
     should know where their food comes from, who is growing it, how it is
     grown and what is in it. 

We
provide value to the world by having a small carbon footprint and providing
nutritious food grown using organic and permaculture practices. 

We
want our contributors to share in the idea that safe, natural, chemical free
products for the body and their home is the kind of forward thinking we need in
the 21st century. 
What
We Need & What You Get
How much money do we need?
We’ve identified three key areas to
focus our funding effort to expand our farm; facilities, equipment, and
start-up operational expenses. The total cost of the project is $97,000 and
breakout as follows:

Facilities:

To reach the true potential of our farm and acreage,
       we need infrastructure. Animals will be contained with almost a mile of fencing,
       a new barn will be erected to shelter the herd to include attached
       milking stations and milk processing room, and a soap studio with retail
       space.
The soap studio, milking room, and milk processing
       room will be a steel structure built atop a concrete slab.
The barn will be a wooden structure.
We will relocate the current chicken coop and expand
       the flock to 200 birds. The relocation of the coop will provide the
       birds with an additional 2 acres of free range space from their current
       one acre of space. This will increase our egg production by ten times
       its current rate.
The facilities will be built to code and the milk
       processing room will be incompliance with USDA guidelines. The milk
       room, processing room, and soap studio will have full utilities as well
       as a separate septic tank rated for food production runoff and waste. 

Equipment:

Equipment to support operations have been identified
       and resides almost entirely with the goat milk operation. Equipment
       includes (not entire list) milk cooler, milk pumping and vacuum system,
       stainless steel regulation sinks, birthing equipment, storage vats,
       shelves, farm tools, upgraded refrigeration equipment.
To expand our current beehive operation of three
       hives, five new hives will be purchased. Additionally, honey extraction
       equipment will be purchased. Currently we utilized the equipment from
       the local bee keepers’ association. 

Startup Operational Expenses:
Startup operational expenses will include the
       purchase of fifteen goats “in milk”, five bee “nuks” with queens, additional
       chickens, straw and saw dust for the chickens, feed for both goats and
       chickens, vet care and animal medical supplies, supplies for bees,
       cleaning and sterilization equipment, fuel and diesel, initial utility
       connection expenses, and office supplies.

One bold combat engineer, brought a bulldozer, leveled off the sand and built a deck so that those in attendance could gather. Every morning as the sun rose over the horizon and every evening as it gave way to the multitude of stars that illuminated the night sky, Café  Cabana was the place to be.The dream to bring Cafe Cabana back to serve our veterans and local community is about to become a reality. But we need your help. Help Letty raise $35,000 to get Cafe Cabana up and running.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

one day feeling extremely ill.  You know
something is not completely right, and you have felt a noticeable lump on your
breast for several months that seems to be getting larger with each passing
day.  Desperation and worry overcome you
like a tsunami, but you continue to keep quiet, as the potential shame of breast
cancer is too great.  If you were sick
from this disease, people would label you a pariah and you would embarrass your
whole family.  However, the thought of
your duty to your children and family takes priority.  <i>""What
will my family do without me here to take care of them and love them?  How will my children make it in such a harsh
world without my teachings and wisdom?"" </i> Overcome by emotion, you decide to seek
medical help.  However, you quickly
realize that there is nowhere to go for quality healthcare.  Finally, you locate a non-profit organization
that provides free mammograms.  As you
anticipate the worst, several thoughts come to mind, such as the cost of
treatment. <i>“I can either feed my family for
years to come or beg and plea for money for treatment as there is no such thing
as insurance or other programs to assist in healthcare.”</i>  Finally, the results come in and you learn
you have advanced stage breast cancer.

is just not feasible and you prepare to die.

<p>  Most women in
America and other Western countries cannot imagine such a bleak outlook on
breast cancer detection and treatment. 
However, the women in Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon do not have to imagine
this scenario, as in most cases this is the harsh reality. Breast cancer is
taboo in these countries, largely due to lack of education, and it is not an acceptable
topic of discussion.  If and when a woman
in one of these countries is brave enough to seek help, there is often none to
be given.  Many times simple mammograms
are nearly impossible to get due to the scarcity of equipment and funding, unless
one is fortunate enough to locate a Western non-profit organization that provides
them.  If a woman is lucky enough to have
her treatment funded through a non-profit, radiation and chemotherapy regimens
often take place in a room that is no more pleasant than a gas station
bathroom.  Additionally, detection of the
disease in these countries is typically in the latter stages, so death is the
standard result.  In fact, there is a mortality
rate in excess of 90% in these countries for women who have breast cancer – a
stark contrast to women in the U.S. and Europe, where there is a 90% survival
rate for breast cancer patients with early detection.  </p>

education and treatment of breast cancer in Nigeria, Cameroon and Ghana.  RFCA is a 501(c)(3) organization that is

</p><p><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>
<p>We
are Jameliah Katherine Adekunle (also known as Jammy) and Catharine Charlotte Wippell
(also known as Wippy) and we are 15 years old. </p>
<p>“Ever
since I was 2 years old, I have had a passion for the arts. Singing, dancing,
musical theatre you name it! This was developed through going to classes at a
stage school near my house. I started off by going once a week and increased to
every other day, as I got older and more interested in theatre. I was also very
interested in art and fashion design from a very young age. This was probably
due to the artistic talent that runs through my family. My mother enjoyed art
as a child and my auntie and uncle are now both successful architects. However,
I think it has mostly to do with my cousin Tommy drawing various things for me
and I copying them. I had numerous amounts of books on drawing including the
most pointless things like how to draw mermaids or dragons.” – Jameliah
Adekunle (Producer and Director of J.C.C.A)</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u>The Impact</u></b></p>
<p>Jammy’s
Children’s Company for the Arts’ (J.C.C.A) mission is to get young people to have
the talent and flare to develop a career in the any of the arts industries,
whether that is as a world-renowned musician, the next Jimmy Choo or Darcey
Bussell. We aim to produce a variety of events that will give them that extra
push that they need in these competitive industries. </p>
<p>“I
have always wanted to go into one of the arts industries and believe that I
will get there through persevering and practicing. I believe that J.C.C.A will
help me just as much it will help the other children! Being able to excel in
the arts industry requires a lot of confidence and strength and I hope J.C.C.A
can provide this.” – Jameliah Adekunle (Producer and Director of J.C.C.A)</p>
<p><b><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></b></p>
<p>We have
realised that there are many obstacles that we may face in creating J.C.C.A
such as the great cost in which putting on these events includes. The hair, the
makeup, the costumes and the theatre all-subtotal to a huge amount of money.
Another obstacle would be the time and effort that goes into putting on these
types of events. However, we believe that we can solve these challenges through
help from campaigns and from other people with the same amount of passion as we
have. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get </u></b></p>
<p>Our
first production will be going ahead in 2016 as the production of the hit
Broadway musical, the Lion King. This is a world renowned musical and has a lot
of scope to be incredible. However, it will be a huge challenge as there are
many obstacles that we may face. This is why we need your help. So far, we have
worked out that the cost for hiring the theatre for the technical and dress
rehearsal as well as the two evening performances will be  roughly £6,000. As you can imagine, this is a lot
of money for two teenage girls! We also would have to hire out dance and drama
studios for the rehearsals to take place, the making of the costumes, set and
for special effects as well as extra costs for advertising i.e flyers, posters
etc. We are striving to gain at least £6,000 for this project and this is not
the only way we are <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">going to get there. We are trying to get sponsorship funds
from other companies that are interested in developing the arts sector in young
people.</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">

<br/></div>","Introduction
We
are Jameliah Katherine Adekunle (also known as Jammy) and Catharine Charlotte Wippell
(also known as Wippy) and we are 15 years old. 
“Ever
since I was 2 years old, I have had a passion for the arts. Singing, dancing,
musical theatre you name it! This was developed through going to classes at a
stage school near my house. I started off by going once a week and increased to
every other day, as I got older and more interested in theatre. I was also very
interested in art and fashion design from a very young age. This was probably
due to the artistic talent that runs through my family. My mother enjoyed art
as a child and my auntie and uncle are now both successful architects. However,
I think it has mostly to do with my cousin Tommy drawing various things for me
and I copying them. I had numerous amounts of books on drawing including the
most pointless things like how to draw mermaids or dragons.” – Jameliah
Adekunle (Producer and Director of J.C.C.A)

The Impact
Jammy’s
Children’s Company for the Arts’ (J.C.C.A) mission is to get young people to have
the talent and flare to develop a career in the any of the arts industries,
whether that is as a world-renowned musician, the next Jimmy Choo or Darcey
Bussell. We aim to produce a variety of events that will give them that extra
push that they need in these competitive industries. 
“I
have always wanted to go into one of the arts industries and believe that I
will get there through persevering and practicing. I believe that J.C.C.A will
help me just as much it will help the other children! Being able to excel in
the arts industry requires a lot of confidence and strength and I hope J.C.C.A
can provide this.” – Jameliah Adekunle (Producer and Director of J.C.C.A)
Risks & Challenges
We have
realised that there are many obstacles that we may face in creating J.C.C.A
such as the great cost in which putting on these events includes. The hair, the
makeup, the costumes and the theatre all-subtotal to a huge amount of money.
Another obstacle would be the time and effort that goes into putting on these
types of events. However, we believe that we can solve these challenges through
help from campaigns and from other people with the same amount of passion as we
have. 

What We Need & What You Get 
Our
first production will be going ahead in 2016 as the production of the hit
Broadway musical, the Lion King. This is a world renowned musical and has a lot
of scope to be incredible. However, it will be a huge challenge as there are
many obstacles that we may face. This is why we need your help. So far, we have
worked out that the cost for hiring the theatre for the technical and dress
rehearsal as well as the two evening performances will be  roughly £6,000. As you can imagine, this is a lot
of money for two teenage girls! We also would have to hire out dance and drama
studios for the rehearsals to take place, the making of the costumes, set and
for special effects as well as extra costs for advertising i.e flyers, posters
etc. We are striving to gain at least £6,000 for this project and this is not
the only way we are going to get there. We are trying to get sponsorship funds
from other companies that are interested in developing the arts sector in young
people.

<h3>BugWall climb to fund Edible Insect Education</h3>
<p>Entomologist, climber, and founder of Bug Vivant Meghan Curry is about to spend  2 weeks thousands of vertical feet above the ground, alone.  She will climb the infamous El Capitan in Yosemite National Park <b>only eating food made with bugs </b>to raise awareness of edible insects as a sustainable food. </p>
<p>Solo big wall climbing is grueling.  Burning upwards of 5000 calories per day, bugs make the perfect protein-rich, nutritious big wall food.  Edible insects are also delicious – with a massive <a href=""http://bugvivant.com/edible-insect-recipes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">culinary</a>, ecological, and<a href=""http://bugvivant.com/why-eat-insects-and-why-it-matters-in-the-west/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> humanitarian</a> potential that we are only beginning to realize.  </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://bugvivant.com/bug-wall/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bug Wall climb</a> is the perfect test for the exciting new movement.  If bugs can power Meghan's punishing 2 week ascent of El Capitan, then perhaps they should earn a spot at your table too.  This is why Meghan has teamed up with Little Herds and nearly every member of the North American edible insect industry who have donated the awesome perks offered in this campaign.  With your help, we will take sustainable edible insect message beyond the BugWall and also fund the edible insect education programs <a href=""http://littleherds.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Little Herds</a>.    </p>

<h3>Why we NEED to Eat Bugs</h3>
<strong>1.</strong><strong>Environmentally sustainable.</strong> They use less land, less water and produce fewer emissions than traditional livestock.<br/><strong>2.</strong><strong>Nutritious.</strong> Bugs provide excellent protein as well as heart healthy Omega-3 fats, and important vitamins and minerals. <br/><strong>3. Easy to Farm. </strong>Bugs have a short life cycle and can be raised in urban environments, freeing up the country-side for oxygen-giving forestry and wildlife.<br/><strong>4. </strong><strong>Ethical.</strong> They can be easily and humanely euthanized for ethical harvesting. <br/><strong>5. </strong><strong>Delicious &amp; Versatile.</strong> They are tasty, easy to prepare and highly versatile. <p><br/></p>

Entomologist, climber, and founder of Bug Vivant Meghan Curry is about to spend  2 weeks thousands of vertical feet above the ground, alone.  She will climb the infamous El Capitan in Yosemite National Park only eating food made with bugs to raise awareness of edible insects as a sustainable food. 
Solo big wall climbing is grueling.  Burning upwards of 5000 calories per day, bugs make the perfect protein-rich, nutritious big wall food.  Edible insects are also delicious – with a massive culinary, ecological, and humanitarian potential that we are only beginning to realize.  

The Bug Wall climb is the perfect test for the exciting new movement.  If bugs can power Meghan's punishing 2 week ascent of El Capitan, then perhaps they should earn a spot at your table too.  This is why Meghan has teamed up with Little Herds and nearly every member of the North American edible insect industry who have donated the awesome perks offered in this campaign.  With your help, we will take sustainable edible insect message beyond the BugWall and also fund the edible insect education programs Little Herds.    


What does Little Herds do?
Little Herds is a multi-chapter nonprofit organization focused on educating our community about entomophagy (eating insects) as an environmentally sound and economically viable way to feed the world.





Why we NEED to Eat Bugs
1.Environmentally sustainable. They use less land, less water and produce fewer emissions than traditional livestock.2.Nutritious. Bugs provide excellent protein as well as heart healthy Omega-3 fats, and important vitamins and minerals. 3. Easy to Farm. Bugs have a short life cycle and can be raised in urban environments, freeing up the country-side for oxygen-giving forestry and wildlife.4. Ethical. They can be easily and humanely euthanized for ethical harvesting. 5. Delicious & Versatile. They are tasty, easy to prepare and highly versatile. 






If we reach our $5000 goal?

After covering the logistical costs of climbing the Bug Wall, all proceeds of this campaign will continue the educational and outreach programs and events hosted by Little Herds.  Specifically, they will:


Purchase new presentation materials like banners and pamphlets to be used at numerous events
Buy ingredients used to make edible insect foods given away at events like their famous Chocolate Chirp Cricket Cookies
Travel to schools to educate a whole new generation about nutritious, sustainable, and delicious edible insects



If we reach our $7000 stretch goal?
Reaching our $7000 stretch goal  will allow Little Herds to create a scaleable edible insect educational package that will be made available to teachers and community educators.  Each package will include:

a copy of Daniella Martinson's book Edible
an entomophagy powerpoint presentation customized to 3 different age groups
a recipe and enough cricket powder to make class-sized batch of Chocolate Chirp Cricket Cookies.

<p>I'm
Mario, from Italy. I'm an entrepreneur and an inventor involved
in technology since 80' and also CEO of my companies Project Studio and Computer Design. I would like to change the way to approach solutions <i><b>using a</b></i>
<b><i>smart point of view</i></b>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After many patents and time spent to understand what is really important and what we really need from technology I understood that the best thing<i><b> we </b><b>need is a smart tech</b></i>  that <i><b>permit to us to reach ubiquity</b></i>. Imagine how cool it will be when you will be able to control any event you care for in the real world, from every place, by simply accessing a special cloud space and immediately interacting with that event! It will be Awesome!<br/></p>
This idea jumps over all limits if I introduce a least but not last concept. I am not alone!. We are not alone!. Maybe we have a family or maybe we have friends and we want, or simply we need to share or delegate with them this control .<br/><br/>The question becomes hard. What it is sure is that we don’t want to become an engineer or a tech specialist to realize this dream, and above all,  we do not want to spend time and money for it.
<p><i><b>We simply need to improve our life quality, saving time,</b></i> simply acting, controlling, sharing and delegating actions from any place without moving, <i><b>simply using the network.</b></i></p>
<p>This
was my staring point, <b><i>this was the seed of ShareZeroSpace technology</i></b>, now developed into a tree.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1391630/files/20150417075541-szs_core.jpg?1429282541"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                                      <i> (Photo of SZS core board)</i><br/>  <br/>This board is the smart hardware core of SZS technology. This is the connector of real events to the SZS cloud. Since the internet network is now spread all over in the world (fixed or mobile) and it does not discriminate on speed or nations, once you have connected the SZS device to internet you have the full control of any event to which this device is locally connected.<br/><br/>And this is the simpliest device with SZS technology inside that allow to transform a normal power-stripe to a smart 4 socket power-stripe.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432051735/kwj6sb9kwco6rsspxkhz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>    (This SZS smart 4 socket power stripe used in demo is also available as a perk!)<br/><br/><i><b>Using the cloud</b></i> portal and a super-simple multilanguages graphic user interface, on tablet, mobile smartphone or PC's, <i><b>you can interact with the event</b></i>, fully freeing the power of Share Zero Space vision.<p> <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1417765/files/20150426233118-lamp.gif?1430116278"" src="""" style=""""/></p>           <i>    (Here pictured a space zone of user account. This is the place for <br/></i><p><i>                               controlling event also with a webcam vision) </i><br/></p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h2>How does it works?<br/>
</h2>
<p>Now let me explain how the system works. You only need to have at least one ShareZeroSpace device composed by a standard core board + a standard multi purposes shield or a specialized functions shield.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1388384/files/20150416081235-board_cor_shield_photo.jpg?1429197155"" src="""" style=""""/>       <i>(Photo of SZS core board connected + multi pourposes shield on bottom)</i><br/></p>
<br/>
<p>You need then to connect the device to the internet network from one side and to the event you need to control on the other. The controlled events may for example be related to <b>electrical motor driven gates, light or light systems, socket or socket stripes, irrigation systems, electrical locks, heating or cooling systems.</b> Or they may consist in events that you need to supervise, such as access to controlled doors, water level controls, power or water metering systems or whatever else is furnished of  an input or output dialogue. The example below shows the capabilities of core SZS board + multi purposes in/out/temp shield.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431103077/e9mzjyvlpxjouqdmpwzp.png"" src="""" style=""""/>This stage will require in most cases ten minutes of work by a non super-tech user, may be you or your electrician, or zero minutes by buying a ready to use device, such the power strip exhibit on demo.</p>
<br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431675037/gf7qpdeyvkyklgcey3ky.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 439.429px; height: 319px;""/></p>                                            ( SZS in all-weather case with dimension)<br/><br/>Then you need to register your new ShareZeroSpace device on the cloud, and, after a ultra simple localized language configuration, all is done.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430770389/twpqaw9nhh5uugbpejsy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 597.67px; height: 448px;""/></p>
<br/>No specialized devices, no apps, no software, no servers, no long time learning curve. By means of any kind of internet connected device, such as mobile phones, tablets, PC’s, internet totems, etc., you can access your ShareZeroSpace zone using your personal account. <br/><br/>Immediately, you be able to operate on your controlled event through a simple and powerful graphic interface.<br/><br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430771251/mhcp8isu0dqjxpc390oi.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 593.726px; height: 262px;""/></p>You can have multiple ShareZeroSpace devices connected and joined to your account in multiple place all over the world. Awesome superpower!.
<p><span></span></p>
<i><b>But, if you remember, we said, we are not alone</b></i>. So we introduce <i><b>the opportunity</b></i>, with no complications, with no overwork, with no wast of time,<i><b> to share</b></i> every single controlled event <i><b>with others</b></i>, to delegate and allow others to control atspecfied times signle event connected to the ShareZeroSpace device.<br/><br/>The friend or delegate will be authorized and alerted with a mail that includes the appropriate information. From this point on, your friend can interact with event, and you, if you desire, will be warned anytime. The cool side is that your shared-event friends, in their ZSZ zone on their accounts, can find and use the shared event.

No problem, if you buy a micro-cloud server running SZS you can create your personal and even private SZS cloud. This mean you can put it in you private network and running it by controlling and sharing event like the world wide cloud on your private network. <br/>If you connect it to the internet (e.g. by your home adsl or wan) this will spread all over the world, and you can reach from any place, but remain your provate SZS cloud </p><p><b>Q</b>: After buy a SZS device, how I need to do for connect it to SZS cloud for control and share event connected to my SZS device</p><p><b>A:</b> What is needed is simply input the unicode serial string (proviced with yout SZS device) in the page ""Device"" after clicking add device. After this operation,you can assign descriptive names to your events and after configuring Ip address of yor network all is done. From now you'll find all event in your ""Zone"" page.  You can from now; control, share and delegate any event. SZS Cloud allow you can do everythings  from any device connected to the internet all over the world.<br/></p><p> <b>Q:</b> Why you think the product also without case?</p><p><b>A</b>: Because we consider the owner want to embed the SZS device in their appliance instead of place another case. However, we design the all-weather case for everytype of installation, inside and outside. In the future we plan to have a case for inside with better design.<br/></p><p><b>Q:</b> How long takes to electrically connect SZS device to an event?</p><p><b>A:</b> Depend on event. In most case, like the electric gate, the irrigations system, the garden lights, etc. is a question of minutes. Consider that digital output o SZS device consist in a relay with open-common-close contact. It's like to connect a standard switch. </p><p><b>Q:</b> Can I use SZS device like a smart house bus component?</p><p><b>A:</b> Yes, the SZS device can work like a smart house bus component. Configuring it with function ""digital input act on related digital output""  and all is done. Locally you'll connect the wall switch to digital input and the related digital output (relay) will work like a switch. From this point you can locally switching the charge (eg.lamp) with your old wall switch and remotely you can use SZS cloud  in your account for control the switch event. The output can work like a two state switch (open/close) or if you want like a push button with desidered hold time (programmable). The power stripe output wokr like this. Remotely you can control related output socket and locally the same using the small red button (see socket stripe demo's photo). Feedback on SZS cloud is always the true state of input or output.  </p><p><b>Q:</b> What type of internet connection need SZS device<br/><br/><b>A:</b> SZS device work with all type of internet connection from super slow 33.6K, to a fast 100M fiber optic. Every type such fixed ADSL, WAN, HDSL work well and for mobile applications GPRS, 3G, 4G are suitable. <br/>Traffic from SZS clousd and SZS device use a very small bandwith and the footrprint of SZS on your network is very small.<br/></p><p><b>Q: </b>What about SZS device in mobile use</p><p><b>A: </b>SZS device work perfecty in mobile use. The device can work with a low power supply (9-12 VDC@ 0.6A max with all relay engaged) and is suitable to work with battery operated or with energy saving system such battery and solar pannel. Communication with internet can be realized using a GPRS, 3G or 4G connection. If SZS device is equipped with a WiFi expansion, it can operate also using smartphone or portable router. This means you can use for eg. for control door car opening or anti theft solution for cutting fuel simply stopping electric fuel car pump.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>

I'm
Mario, from Italy. I'm an entrepreneur and an inventor involved
in technology since 80' and also CEO of my companies Project Studio and Computer Design. I would like to change the way to approach solutions using a
smart point of view.



After many patents and time spent to understand what is really important and what we really need from technology I understood that the best thing we need is a smart tech  that permit to us to reach ubiquity. Imagine how cool it will be when you will be able to control any event you care for in the real world, from every place, by simply accessing a special cloud space and immediately interacting with that event! It will be Awesome!
This idea jumps over all limits if I introduce a least but not last concept. I am not alone!. We are not alone!. Maybe we have a family or maybe we have friends and we want, or simply we need to share or delegate with them this control .The question becomes hard. What it is sure is that we don’t want to become an engineer or a tech specialist to realize this dream, and above all,  we do not want to spend time and money for it.
We simply need to improve our life quality, saving time, simply acting, controlling, sharing and delegating actions from any place without moving, simply using the network.
This
was my staring point, this was the seed of ShareZeroSpace technology, now developed into a tree.
                                                       (Photo of SZS core board)  This board is the smart hardware core of SZS technology. This is the connector of real events to the SZS cloud. Since the internet network is now spread all over in the world (fixed or mobile) and it does not discriminate on speed or nations, once you have connected the SZS device to internet you have the full control of any event to which this device is locally connected.And this is the simpliest device with SZS technology inside that allow to transform a normal power-stripe to a smart 4 socket power-stripe.    (This SZS smart 4 socket power stripe used in demo is also available as a perk!)Using the cloud portal and a super-simple multilanguages graphic user interface, on tablet, mobile smartphone or PC's, you can interact with the event, fully freeing the power of Share Zero Space vision. 
               (Here pictured a space zone of user account. This is the place for                                controlling event also with a webcam vision) 

How does it works?

Now let me explain how the system works. You only need to have at least one ShareZeroSpace device composed by a standard core board + a standard multi purposes shield or a specialized functions shield.
       (Photo of SZS core board connected + multi pourposes shield on bottom)

You need then to connect the device to the internet network from one side and to the event you need to control on the other. The controlled events may for example be related to electrical motor driven gates, light or light systems, socket or socket stripes, irrigation systems, electrical locks, heating or cooling systems. Or they may consist in events that you need to supervise, such as access to controlled doors, water level controls, power or water metering systems or whatever else is furnished of  an input or output dialogue. The example below shows the capabilities of core SZS board + multi purposes in/out/temp shield.
This stage will require in most cases ten minutes of work by a non super-tech user, may be you or your electrician, or zero minutes by buying a ready to use device, such the power strip exhibit on demo.

                                            ( SZS in all-weather case with dimension)Then you need to register your new ShareZeroSpace device on the cloud, and, after a ultra simple localized language configuration, all is done.
No specialized devices, no apps, no software, no servers, no long time learning curve. By means of any kind of internet connected device, such as mobile phones, tablets, PC’s, internet totems, etc., you can access your ShareZeroSpace zone using your personal account. Immediately, you be able to operate on your controlled event through a simple and powerful graphic interface.
You can have multiple ShareZeroSpace devices connected and joined to your account in multiple place all over the world. Awesome superpower!.

But, if you remember, we said, we are not alone. So we introduce the opportunity, with no complications, with no overwork, with no wast of time, to share every single controlled event with others, to delegate and allow others to control atspecfied times signle event connected to the ShareZeroSpace device.The friend or delegate will be authorized and alerted with a mail that includes the appropriate information. From this point on, your friend can interact with event, and you, if you desire, will be warned anytime. The cool side is that your shared-event friends, in their ZSZ zone on their accounts, can find and use the shared event. When you desire to stop the sharing, with a simple action you can cancel it. Finally you can also be warned if something has changed by e-mail ( we plan in the future to integrate a sms alert function) if someting event  has changed status, like a opened SZS controlled door or a electric motor failure when SZS will be adopted for check power overcharge.Since also other people may have an account and multiple SZS device under their control, also they can share with you the control of events. It's like a social network of things, instead of a social network of words. You can do what you want no matter of community (share), no matter of time (zero), no matter of distance (space). We are designing a special functionality that permits in the future the release of software to share and interact with SZS technology directly by common socials network.The vision emerging from ShareZeroSpace is that with zero time (without waiting) and zero space (without moving) we can interact with real world events, sharing the resource. That's all.Simple, sure, instantly and primarily all, smart!.If you help us joining this campaign, we help you not only to enjoy of this smart solution, but we together can really change our way to enjoy life and have more free time and fun!.Together we can make the difference from suffer the technology to steer technology!

We make the cloud version running well,
and you can verify this by connecting to sharezerospace using the credential: e-mail: demo password: 12345. Once you logged in, then click on Zone and then click icon ""control"" on rigth side of lava lamp row. Please note, in this demo,  user account data is locked for avoiding undesidered user data changement.At this point you can locate the lamp status indicator and the command icon where, by clicking, you can control the switching of lamp. You also can use a web cam icon, by clicking it and, after you inserted the camera account (user:user, password:user), direct live video will appear on the screen, showing what happens to the lamp at the moment. You can find all the instructions about demo features and vision, in the document    ""Thechnology that we really need"" .

By reading it, you can run and enjoy demos, and undestand exactly what happen while you control a lava lamp attached to a power stripe (with szs core smart device + a special shield inside) on our office with online web camera view .

will be accomplished, even you, can enjoy about the success,  maybe using your personal ShareZeroSpace device or any event shared with you by your friends or your company.Questions and Answers (Q&A)Q: I like solutions offered by SZS but what's about the question I want make a private cloud running only on my private network.A: Hi funder. No problem, if you buy a micro-cloud server running SZS you can create your personal and even private SZS cloud. This mean you can put it in you private network and running it by controlling and sharing event like the world wide cloud on your private network. If you connect it to the internet (e.g. by your home adsl or wan) this will spread all over the world, and you can reach from any place, but remain your provate SZS cloud Q: After buy a SZS device, how I need to do for connect it to SZS cloud for control and share event connected to my SZS deviceA: What is needed is simply input the unicode serial string (proviced with yout SZS device) in the page ""Device"" after clicking add device. After this operation,you can assign descriptive names to your events and after configuring Ip address of yor network all is done. From now you'll find all event in your ""Zone"" page.  You can from now; control, share and delegate any event. SZS Cloud allow you can do everythings  from any device connected to the internet all over the world. Q: Why you think the product also without case?A: Because we consider the owner want to embed the SZS device in their appliance instead of place another case. However, we design the all-weather case for everytype of installation, inside and outside. In the future we plan to have a case for inside with better design.Q: How long takes to electrically connect SZS device to an event?A: Depend on event. In most case, like the electric gate, the irrigations system, the garden lights, etc. is a question of minutes. Consider that digital output o SZS device consist in a relay with open-common-close contact. It's like to connect a standard switch. Q: Can I use SZS device like a smart house bus component?A: Yes, the SZS device can work like a smart house bus component. Configuring it with function ""digital input act on related digital output""  and all is done. Locally you'll connect the wall switch to digital input and the related digital output (relay) will work like a switch. From this point you can locally switching the charge (eg.lamp) with your old wall switch and remotely you can use SZS cloud  in your account for control the switch event. The output can work like a two state switch (open/close) or if you want like a push button with desidered hold time (programmable). The power stripe output wokr like this. Remotely you can control related output socket and locally the same using the small red button (see socket stripe demo's photo). Feedback on SZS cloud is always the true state of input or output.  Q: What type of internet connection need SZS deviceA: SZS device work with all type of internet connection from super slow 33.6K, to a fast 100M fiber optic. Every type such fixed ADSL, WAN, HDSL work well and for mobile applications GPRS, 3G, 4G are suitable. Traffic from SZS clousd and SZS device use a very small bandwith and the footrprint of SZS on your network is very small.Q: What about SZS device in mobile useA: SZS device work perfecty in mobile use. The device can work with a low power supply (9-12 VDC@ 0.6A max with all relay engaged) and is suitable to work with battery operated or with energy saving system such battery and solar pannel. Communication with internet can be realized using a GPRS, 3G or 4G connection. If SZS device is equipped with a WiFi expansion, it can operate also using smartphone or portable router. This means you can use for eg. for control door car opening or anti theft solution for cutting fuel simply stopping electric fuel car pump.",14.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Oil and diamonds give it a wealth that is rare in sub-Saharan Africa, and you see the riches in jewelry shops, Champagnes and $10,000-a-month one-bedroom apartments in the capital, Luanda.</p>
<p>Under the corrupt and autocratic president, José Eduardo dos Santos, who has ruled for 35 years, billions of dollars flow to a small elite — as kids starve.</p>
<p>President dos Santos, whose nation’s oil gives him warm, strong ties to the United States and Europe, <a href=""http://makaangola.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11402&amp;Itemid=266&amp;lang=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hires a public relations firm to promote his rule</a>, but he doesn’t take the simplest steps to help his people. Some of the poorest countries, such as Mauritania and Burkina Faso, <a href=""http://www.ffinetwork.org/global_progress/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fortify flour with micronutrients</a> — one of the cheapest ways possible to save lives — yet dos Santos hasn’t tried that. He invests roughly three times as much on defense and security as on health.</p>
<p>“Children die because there is no medicine,” lamented Alfred Nambua, a village chief in a thatch-roof village on a rutted dirt road near the northern city of Malanje. The village has no school, no latrine, no bed nets. The only drinking water is a contaminated creek an hour’s hike away.</p>
<p>“Now there’s nothing,” said Nambua, 73, adding that life was better before independence in 1975.</p>
<p>“In the colonial period, when I was sick, they were afraid I would die and gave me good care,” he said, and he pretended to shiver in imitation of malaria. “Now when I’m sick, no one cares if I die.”</p>
<p>Statisticians say that Angola’s child mortality is, in fact, declining — but achingly slowly.</p>
<p>“Death in this country is normal,” said Dr. Bimjimba Norberto, who runs a clinic in a slum outside the capital. A few doors down, a funeral was beginning for Denize Angweta, a 10-month-old baby who had just died of malaria.</p>
<p>“If I lived in another country, I could still be playing with my daughter,” Denize’s father, Armondo Matuba, said bitterly.</p>
<p>It may get worse. With falling oil prices, the government has proposed a one-third cut in the health budget this year.</p>
<p>I’ve often criticized Western countries for not being more generous with aid. Yet it’s equally important to hold developing countries accountable.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to see why Western countries should continue to donate to Angola and thus let rich Angolans off the hook as they drive Porsches.</p>
<p>There are many ways for a leader to kill his people, and although dos Santos isn’t committing genocide he is presiding over the systematic looting of his state and neglect of his people. As a result, 150,000 Angolan children die annually. Let’s hold dos Santos accountable and recognize that extreme corruption and negligence can be something close to a mass atrocity.</p>

“Death in this country is normal,” said Dr. Bimjimba Norberto, who runs a clinic in a slum outside the capital. A few doors down, a funeral was beginning for Denize Angweta, a 10-month-old baby who had just died of malaria.
“If I lived in another country, I could still be playing with my daughter,” Denize’s father, Armondo Matuba, said bitterly.
It may get worse. With falling oil prices, the government has proposed a one-third cut in the health budget this year.
I’ve often criticized Western countries for not being more generous with aid. Yet it’s equally important to hold developing countries accountable.
It’s difficult to see why Western countries should continue to donate to Angola and thus let rich Angolans off the hook as they drive Porsches.
There are many ways for a leader to kill his people, and although dos Santos isn’t committing genocide he is presiding over the systematic looting of his state and neglect of his people. As a result, 150,000 Angolan children die annually. Let’s hold dos Santos accountable and recognize that extreme corruption and negligence can be something close to a mass atrocity.",0.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<h3>Who We Are </h3>The Refugee Legal Service (Tasmania) is a not for profit refugee legal

isn’t easy. Applying for one involves
detailed, technical preparation that only a trained lawyer or migration agent
can provide. There is no Legal Aid available to pay for this service and – as
they are legally forbidden from working – very few find the resources to pay
for it themselves.</p>

</p><p><strong>** English follows below**</strong></p><p>Les enfants adorent jouer, explorer, imaginer et quelle meilleure
façon de les inciter qu’un centre d'activités? Les terrains de jeux intérieurs
sont devenus de plus en plus populaires au Canada. Ces centres de loisirs vont
bien au-delà d’un espace de jeux à l’intérieure des restaurants de restauration
rapide. Ces centres disposent de multiples activités appropriées pour enfants de
10 ans et moins, ainsi que des endroits confortables pour les adultes afin
pendant que leurs enfants s’amusent.</p>
<p>À ce stade, nous avons travaillé dur pour rassembler toutes les
informations et nous avons pris les mesures nécessaires pour l'ouverture du
centre. Qui aurait pu savoir que ce serait une telle aventure! Maintenant, nous
sommes à la recherche d’aide de la communauté pour nous aider à faire le reste
du chemin! Comme vous pouvez imaginez, ce type d'aventure est très coûteux,
cette campagne
nous aidera énormément avec les banques, non seulement en termes d'emprunt,
mais aussi en pour notre stratégie de marché,
si nous pouvons réussir à amasser suffisamment d'argent, alors la banque verra
que notre entreprise est nécessaire et il aidera à mieux justifier l'ouverture.
Voilà pourquoi nous demandons à la communauté de participer et de nous aider à
rendre ceci possible! Avec votre aide, nous serons définitivement en mesure d'ouvrir
le centre et bientôt tous nos enfants pourront courir, sauter, jouer, explorer
et grandir ensemble!</p>
<p>Nous avons trouvé quelques récompenses intéressantes et attrayantes dont
vous allez pouvoir profiter! Non seulement vous recevrez ces récompenses, mais
nous voulons aussi que notre entreprise fasse partie de la communauté, c'est
pourquoi nous avons mis au point l'idée d'avoir un ""mur des partisans"".
Le mur des partisans sera dans le centre et contiendra tous les noms des
personnes qui nous ont appuyés durant la campagne. Nous pensons qu'il va
ajouter une touche spéciale au centre et vraiment afficher l'aspect communautaire
que nous voulons capturer! En plus de tout cela, nous voulons vraiment donner
en retour, ce qui est pourquoi pour chaque 10 $ amassé lors de la campagne,
nous allons faire un don de 1 $ à la banque alimentaire locale. Nous pensons que
ce sera un moyen fantastique pour aider à redonner à la communauté et aider nos
voisins dans le besoin!</p>
<p>Nous sommes très heureux de créer cette entreprise à Aylmer, avec tant
d'amour pour la ville, nous savons que ce sera un merveilleux ajout!</p><p>
</p><p>S'il
vous plaît, notez que si jamais ce projet tombe à l’eau, tout fonds reçu durant
la campagne sera remboursé.</p>

<p>Kids love to play, explore, imagine and what better way to
entice them than a activity center? Indoor playgrounds have become increasingly
popular around the country. These recreation centers go way beyond play spaces inside
a fast food restaurant. They feature age appropriate activity areas for kids
age 10 and under, as well as comfortable places for adults to gather while
their children are engaged in active fun!</p>
<p>At this point, we've been working hard to
gather all the information and have taken the necessary steps to opening the
center. Who could have known that this would be such an adventure, but it's
been exhilarating! Now we're looking to the community to help us make it
the rest of the way! As you can imagine, this type of adventure is quite
costly, this campaign will
help us immensely with the banks, not only in terms of borrowing, but also in
terms of our market strategy, if we can successfully raise enough money, then
the banks will see that our business is needed and it will help better justify
opening. That's why we're asking the community to join in and help make this
happen! With your help we will definitely be able to get the center open and
soon all our children will be able to run, jump, play, explore and grow
together!</p>
<p>We've come up with some interesting and
enticing perks that you can take advantage of! Not only will you receive the
perks, but as a small center we want our business to be a part of the
community, which is why we've come up with the idea to have a ""Backer's
Wall"". The Backer's wall will be in the center and will have all the names
of our supporters written on it. We think it will add that special touch
to the center and really portray the community aspect that we want to
capture! In addition to all of this, we really want to give back,
which is why for every 10$ raised during our campaign we're going to donate 1$

give back to the community and help out our neighbors in need! </p>

<br/></div>","** English follows below**Les enfants adorent jouer, explorer, imaginer et quelle meilleure
façon de les inciter qu’un centre d'activités? Les terrains de jeux intérieurs
sont devenus de plus en plus populaires au Canada. Ces centres de loisirs vont
bien au-delà d’un espace de jeux à l’intérieure des restaurants de restauration
rapide. Ces centres disposent de multiples activités appropriées pour enfants de
10 ans et moins, ainsi que des endroits confortables pour les adultes afin
pendant que leurs enfants s’amusent.
À ce stade, nous avons travaillé dur pour rassembler toutes les
informations et nous avons pris les mesures nécessaires pour l'ouverture du
centre. Qui aurait pu savoir que ce serait une telle aventure! Maintenant, nous
sommes à la recherche d’aide de la communauté pour nous aider à faire le reste
du chemin! Comme vous pouvez imaginez, ce type d'aventure est très coûteux,
cette campagne
nous aidera énormément avec les banques, non seulement en termes d'emprunt,
mais aussi en pour notre stratégie de marché,
si nous pouvons réussir à amasser suffisamment d'argent, alors la banque verra
que notre entreprise est nécessaire et il aidera à mieux justifier l'ouverture.
Voilà pourquoi nous demandons à la communauté de participer et de nous aider à
rendre ceci possible! Avec votre aide, nous serons définitivement en mesure d'ouvrir
le centre et bientôt tous nos enfants pourront courir, sauter, jouer, explorer
et grandir ensemble!
Nous avons trouvé quelques récompenses intéressantes et attrayantes dont
vous allez pouvoir profiter! Non seulement vous recevrez ces récompenses, mais
nous voulons aussi que notre entreprise fasse partie de la communauté, c'est
pourquoi nous avons mis au point l'idée d'avoir un ""mur des partisans"".
Le mur des partisans sera dans le centre et contiendra tous les noms des
personnes qui nous ont appuyés durant la campagne. Nous pensons qu'il va
ajouter une touche spéciale au centre et vraiment afficher l'aspect communautaire
que nous voulons capturer! En plus de tout cela, nous voulons vraiment donner
en retour, ce qui est pourquoi pour chaque 10 $ amassé lors de la campagne,
nous allons faire un don de 1 $ à la banque alimentaire locale. Nous pensons que
ce sera un moyen fantastique pour aider à redonner à la communauté et aider nos
voisins dans le besoin!
Nous sommes très heureux de créer cette entreprise à Aylmer, avec tant
d'amour pour la ville, nous savons que ce sera un merveilleux ajout!
S'il
vous plaît, notez que si jamais ce projet tombe à l’eau, tout fonds reçu durant
la campagne sera remboursé.

Kids love to play, explore, imagine and what better way to
entice them than a activity center? Indoor playgrounds have become increasingly
popular around the country. These recreation centers go way beyond play spaces inside
a fast food restaurant. They feature age appropriate activity areas for kids
age 10 and under, as well as comfortable places for adults to gather while
their children are engaged in active fun!
At this point, we've been working hard to
gather all the information and have taken the necessary steps to opening the
center. Who could have known that this would be such an adventure, but it's
been exhilarating! Now we're looking to the community to help us make it
the rest of the way! As you can imagine, this type of adventure is quite
costly, this campaign will
help us immensely with the banks, not only in terms of borrowing, but also in
terms of our market strategy, if we can successfully raise enough money, then
the banks will see that our business is needed and it will help better justify
opening. That's why we're asking the community to join in and help make this
happen! With your help we will definitely be able to get the center open and
soon all our children will be able to run, jump, play, explore and grow
together!
We've come up with some interesting and
enticing perks that you can take advantage of! Not only will you receive the
perks, but as a small center we want our business to be a part of the
community, which is why we've come up with the idea to have a ""Backer's
Wall"". The Backer's wall will be in the center and will have all the names
of our supporters written on it. We think it will add that special touch
to the center and really portray the community aspect that we want to

<p>The Therapeutic Arts
Alliance is where the arts are used to engage and inspire healing in every
individual.  Currently offering
Homeopathy and Music Therapy, the goal is to ultimately provide a full menu of high-quality
healing arts for a wide range of clients. 
</p>
<p><i>Our Indiegogo Campaign is set up to help us put the
finishing touches on our space, obtain needed equipment and instruments and
finally get our doors open to the public. 
</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>A therapeutic space with
multi-disciplinary involvement has been the dream of Homeopath Elizabeth
Breadon and Music Therapist Jill Buchanan for many years.  Therapeutic partners for 10 years, both Liz
and Jill feel strongly about being in the moment with their clients in a safe,
well-lit and energetically healing space. 
Working out of client’s living rooms has definite benefits, but both
clinicians have decided their energy is now best spent focused in the clinic
rather than on the road.  The time for an
innovative concept to become reality is here.</p>
<p>Your support of this
campaign would enable Liz and Jill to finally develop a centralized space for
many people to come together to participate in enriching programs such as:</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>One on one therapeutic
support through Homeopathy</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Individual and group Music
Therapy sessions for children with special needs and their families</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Specialized movement
therapy sessions for individuals and groups</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Professional song shares
and networking among Expressive Arts Therapists</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Supervised clinical
space for student Homeopaths</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Evening relaxation
groups for parents of children with special needs</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Regular lectures on
health, wellness and relaxation</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Lessons in clinical
music theory and clinical music improvisation</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Music lessons for the
child with special needs</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>And much, much more!</p>
<p>Liz and Jill both work
in fields that insurance currently does not cover, so they have historically
only worked with families who can afford the out of pocket fees for these
services.  The underlying mission of the
Therapeutic Arts Alliance has been to come together in a space where all people
can afford to find healing for themselves or their families, with or without insurance
coverage.  Whether one is looking for
constitutional support through Homeopathy or communication skill development
through Music Therapy, the Therapeutic Arts Alliance will be a place where folks
from all over the Greater Boston area can find information, support and
relief.  </p>
<p><i>Your funding will help them meet this mission.</i>  </p>
<p>Instruments need to be
obtained and in some cases, relocated – all which costs a significant amount of
money. Keeping the doors open while the clientele is built is extremely important.  One can only attend to a small number of
families while moving from living room to living room.  Once the clinic space is open, opportunities
to expand the clientele abound, thereby creating a more financially stable
business.  Both clinicians have a waiting
list of potential clients, though setting folks into a working schedule is
always more of a challenge than expected! 
This all takes time.  Your financial
support will enable Liz and Jill to focus on this development without the
threat of an empty bank account for rent, utilities and insurance.  Much of their own personal financial
resources have already been directed toward this endeavor.  </p>
<p><i>We ask that you join us in shouldering the exciting and
life-affirming weight of opening a new and enriching environment for healing
through the therapeutic arts!</i></p>
<p>What if the goal of raising
$6000 isn’t met?  That’s OK.  Every single penny raised will work hard to
create the therapeutic space Liz and Jill envision.  Sometimes it just takes a little longer than
planned.  </p>
<p>Offer support in
whatever amount you are comfortable with. 
</p>
<p>~ Because you know how
beneficial the therapeutic arts can be.</p>
<p>~ Because you have a
child with special needs who needs support.</p>
<p>~ Because <b>you</b> need support as a parent or
caregiver of a child with special needs. </p>
<p><i>~ Mostly because you see the need for such a space, too</i>.  <i>For
whatever reason.</i></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><br/>I'm a Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor specializing in the evidence-based methods of Acceptance Commitment Therapy, Dialectic Behavior Therapy, the Gottman Method, and Coherence Therapy. </p>
<p>People come to me when they are stuck or their relationship is stuck. I help them gain insight for what their pain is trying to tell them, and then give them real, practical tools for coping and thriving. I'm not a smile-and-nod therapist. We'll laugh, cry, be astonished, and stomp the inertia. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>My dream is to create a beautiful and cozy space reminiscent of an apothecary shop and Diagon Alley. I've found a beautiful space in Jefferson Park. Now it's just about furnishing and personalizing it. </li>
<li>Furniture is expensive! I'm estimating $3000 to furnish the office and waiting room. In my old office, many clients would complain the sofa was uncomfortable or too low to the ground.  I want a space that feels genuine and inviting, chairs and sofas that are comfortable. </li>
<li>I'm estimating $1500 for decor, including paint, curtains, ""house jewelry"" (switch plates etc), etc. $500 for marketing, $350 for a laptop and printer, $400 for supplies, and $1000 for start-up fees like registering the LLC etc. Yes, I'm asking for less than I actually need. If I can hit stretch goals, awesome. </li>
<li>The amazing Chalk Girl is designing a logo for me, as well as a Feelings Wheel painting for the wall of my office, as many people have trouble identifying emotions. Also, because I'm kind of a brat, I've commissioned her to re-create the charcoal drawing ""Il Duomo as Seen from Belvedere"" for the lobby as well. We'll see who gets it. </li>
<li>If I don't reach the entire goal, we'll start with less and add over time. It's a priority for me to offer perks you're excited about, and to give you something of value for your hard-earned dollar. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>My husband noticed that, when I come home from work the most satisfied, it's because I helped someone to realize they are not crazy or alone. </li>
<li>Trauma sucks. Shame sucks. It's excruciating when you feel alienated from the person you love best.  </li>
<li>I help people recover from situations that feel intolerable. </li>
<li>Real feedback from clients: <ul>
<li>""It's the first time I ever left a therapy session feeling like I could change anything."" </li>
<li>""It's wonderful to see the kind of freedom I've been able to find over the last year, and I just wanted to circle back with you and thank you for the big impact you had on me."" </li>
<li>""Thank you for your wonderful, judgment free, and genuine care you provided over the past few months... it was literally life-saving."" </li>
<li>""I'm not exaggerating when I say that Nikki saved my life."" </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Starting a business is a <i>huge</i> risk. For the past several years, I've had clients coming in through the roof from a thriving group practice that contracted me. Not only is there the financial risk of a business not succeeding, but there's the emotional risk to clients if their therapist shuts their doors. So what gives me the chutzpah to do it? </p>
<ul>
<li>I spent 10 years in finance before leaving Corporate America to work as a therapist. </li>
<li>I worked closely with the owners at a thriving yoga studio, and then closely with the owners for my first year at a therapy group practice, learning the best practices for owning and administrating a mind-body business. </li>
<li>I've won two awards for outstanding contribution at my current place of practice, including Therapist of the Year.</li>
<li>Over 90% of the people who attend a session with me come back within 10 days, and clients will schedule out their next sessions over 3-4 weeks to make sure they can get into my packed caseload. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tweet, Share, promote, brag, anything using the Indiegogo share tools! </li>
<li>Remember the Helping Hips show on January 13th! </li>
</ul>

People come to me when they are stuck or their relationship is stuck. I help them gain insight for what their pain is trying to tell them, and then give them real, practical tools for coping and thriving. I'm not a smile-and-nod therapist. We'll laugh, cry, be astonished, and stomp the inertia. 

 
What We Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:

My dream is to create a beautiful and cozy space reminiscent of an apothecary shop and Diagon Alley. I've found a beautiful space in Jefferson Park. Now it's just about furnishing and personalizing it. 
Furniture is expensive! I'm estimating $3000 to furnish the office and waiting room. In my old office, many clients would complain the sofa was uncomfortable or too low to the ground.  I want a space that feels genuine and inviting, chairs and sofas that are comfortable. 
I'm estimating $1500 for decor, including paint, curtains, ""house jewelry"" (switch plates etc), etc. $500 for marketing, $350 for a laptop and printer, $400 for supplies, and $1000 for start-up fees like registering the LLC etc. Yes, I'm asking for less than I actually need. If I can hit stretch goals, awesome. 
The amazing Chalk Girl is designing a logo for me, as well as a Feelings Wheel painting for the wall of my office, as many people have trouble identifying emotions. Also, because I'm kind of a brat, I've commissioned her to re-create the charcoal drawing ""Il Duomo as Seen from Belvedere"" for the lobby as well. We'll see who gets it. 
If I don't reach the entire goal, we'll start with less and add over time. It's a priority for me to offer perks you're excited about, and to give you something of value for your hard-earned dollar. 


The Impact

My husband noticed that, when I come home from work the most satisfied, it's because I helped someone to realize they are not crazy or alone. 
Trauma sucks. Shame sucks. It's excruciating when you feel alienated from the person you love best.  
I help people recover from situations that feel intolerable. 
Real feedback from clients: 
""It's the first time I ever left a therapy session feeling like I could change anything."" 
""It's wonderful to see the kind of freedom I've been able to find over the last year, and I just wanted to circle back with you and thank you for the big impact you had on me."" 
""Thank you for your wonderful, judgment free, and genuine care you provided over the past few months... it was literally life-saving."" 
""I'm not exaggerating when I say that Nikki saved my life."" 




Risks & Challenges
Starting a business is a huge risk. For the past several years, I've had clients coming in through the roof from a thriving group practice that contracted me. Not only is there the financial risk of a business not succeeding, but there's the emotional risk to clients if their therapist shuts their doors. So what gives me the chutzpah to do it? 

I spent 10 years in finance before leaving Corporate America to work as a therapist. 
I worked closely with the owners at a thriving yoga studio, and then closely with the owners for my first year at a therapy group practice, learning the best practices for owning and administrating a mind-body business. 
I've won two awards for outstanding contribution at my current place of practice, including Therapist of the Year.
Over 90% of the people who attend a session with me come back within 10 days, and clients will schedule out their next sessions over 3-4 weeks to make sure they can get into my packed caseload.

<h3>Love Well Delivery</h3>
<p>Help us provide immune support for those who are ill throughout the Fall/Winter flu season- and into the New Year ahead!</p>
<ul></ul>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>My name is Jennie Hayes, the creator of the Love Well Delivery concept.  The project has been born entirely from compassion and the desire to help those in the SF Bay Area have access to holistic food and medicine while suffering from a variety of different ailments at home.  Although there are many different products that are offered as supplement to our package bundles (see <a href=""http://www.lovewelldelivery.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.lovewelldelivery.com</a> for details), the mainstay for the entire project is a special bone-broth based soup designed by myself and my oldest childhood friend, Dr. Starr Ramson N.D. (Naturopathic Doctor).  While there are many bone-broth soups available on the market, ours differs in many ways; containing super-food ingredients such as medicinal mushrooms and specialized herbs to support the healing of a variety of different immune disruptions, including:</p>
<p>-common cold</p>
<p>-influenza</p>
<p>-inflammatory digestive disorders</p>
<p>Aptly titled, ""Magic Healing Soup,"" this freshly-made product has been developed carefully with the experience and formulation of a skilled holistic medical practitioner.  As to my own background; I have over a decade of wellness education including Massage Therapy, Ayurveda, Yoga and anatomical studies.  Most importantly, this special soup has been created with the intention to help those who are suffering from illness find their way back to SUPERIOR health.   We want to see our clients find a new standard of higher immunity. I believe if given the opportunity to see this project get off the ground, beginning with our kitchen rental in Berkeley, CA - that we could help MANY in the Bay Area. </p>
<p>In addition to our medicinal bone-broth soup, we will be providing hydrating elixirs, immune boosting teas, herbal tinctures provided by Five Flavors Herbs (Oakland, CA) and essential oils provided by Floracopeia.    We also have holistic medicinal packages for women suffering from PMS, pre/post-natal mothers, and those recovering from hangover. </p>
<p>All of these products and bundles would be prepared at our kitchen, located in North Berkeley.  We have selected a kitchen sublet shared with Morrell's Bread and are simply waiting to put down the deposit, knowing that the project has enough backing to get started.  This space is absolutely perfect for Love Well; it contains the potential for both production AND retail or pick-up hours, meaning that two days a week, we would have walk-in or pick-up hours available. If you choose to donate your donations would go directly to:</p>
<p>-The kitchen rental and deposit  (Deposit plus 6 months rent = $4200)</p>
<p>-Kitchen equipment including large soup pots, cutting boards and industrial blender</p>
<p>-Jars and storage materials for transport and delivery</p>
<p>-Wholesale orders of the Herbal Tincture, local Honey,  essential oil, local Organic produce/herbs and beef bones</p>
<p>-Transportation for delivery</p>
<p>Quite simply, I know this project can succeed. It is a matter of timing (flu season is ahead!), raising awareness and getting our product in people's hands as soon as possible, so we can immediately begin helping those who are sick and at home return to better health! </p>

Berger and Quincy J. Allen --  who wanted
to welcome fans of all forms of speculative fiction into the traditional fan
community.  They were joined by some
other fans who wanted to add a new convention to the already existing list of
amazing fan conventions…and be inclusive, accessible, diverse, and affordable –
and kid friendly.</span></p>
<p>We
found a venue that was large enough to welcome hundreds or thousands of fans in
a place where no fan con had ever happened before…and like the fans of the 30s,
40s, 50s, 60s, and up to the present day, we are willing to travel a bit
farther to bring some amazing speakers, artists, musicians, costumers,
celebrities and other Guests of Honor to the coast of Washington State.</p>
<p>Put
on by an all-fan, all-volunteer, non-profit group made up of fans with decades
of experience in con running and attending (from all over the globe), our first
annual convention will feature award-winning authors Mike Resnick, Nancy Kress,
Elizabeth Ann Scarborough, Jody Lynn Nye, David Gerrold, William F. Nolan, James E. Gunn and many others, including Hugo
nominee Jennifer Brozek, Angela Korra’ti, Raven Oak, with other guests such as
Scott Hungerford (Games), Marvel comic artist (and fine artist) Jeffrey
Veregge, Musical guest Dara Korra’ti of Crime &amp; the Forces of Evil, Tor
editor Beth Meacham, and actor Drew Hobson (Voice of Marcus, State of Decay).  <b>We hope
to be an international fan destination</b> as we add more speakers and guests in

<p><b>We Are ALL SF Con</b> will include an award
ceremony, a banquet, a costume ball, panels and talks for writers, artists, musicians,
science, gaming, costumes, anime, comics and more!  Master Class Writers’ Workshop with Nancy
Kress! There will be an art show and a dealer room with books, art, jewelry,
costumes, collectibles, and other gift items for sale.  Concerts. Dances. Hall costume awards!  We will have separate rooms for kid-friendly

</p>
<p>My name is Owen, I am 9 years old and I LOVE dogs. My mom and dad have always said that kids learn best by doing.  Last year when I was 8, I found recipes for YUMMY dog biscuits and began to play around with them.  I came up with the idea for my dog treat business by reading a book about the importance of learning how to handle money.  It talked about earning it, saving it, spending it, and giving back to the community. I knew that dogs loved my treats and wanted to build a business that helped animals.  Mom is helping me with my project and I hope you can, too.</p>

<p>

<p>
</p>
<p>These are just some of the base ingredients in Owen's Yummy Yo's.  No chemicals or By Products.  These pet treats are easy for your pet to digest and contribute to lasting health.  Owen's Yummy Yo's will freeze up to six months and still be tasty and enjoyable for your pet to eat.  <br/><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Why We Need Your Help &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Owen's Yummy Os's is run out of our home kitchen.  In order to increase our supply and grow our customer base so that more pets have the opportunity to eat healthy snacks we have to raise additional funds for larger ovens, storage and basic marketing.  </p>

<br/>
</div></div>","Short Summary 

My name is Owen, I am 9 years old and I LOVE dogs. My mom and dad have always said that kids learn best by doing.  Last year when I was 8, I found recipes for YUMMY dog biscuits and began to play around with them.  I came up with the idea for my dog treat business by reading a book about the importance of learning how to handle money.  It talked about earning it, saving it, spending it, and giving back to the community. I knew that dogs loved my treats and wanted to build a business that helped animals.  Mom is helping me with my project and I hope you can, too.





We love our pets as we are sure you do, too.  This adventure we are going on as a family is not only about teaching our child how to be a responsible business owner and member of a community, but also about learning healthy alternatives to the modern lifestyle—for people and for pets.


Owen's Yummy Yo's are all natural pet treats that must be refrigerated (or frozen).  That's how fresh they are, and how fresh ideally you want them to be.  


Chicken or Beef Broth, Wheat Germ, All-purpose Flour, Whole Wheat Flour, Oats, Cheese, Bacon, etc.


These are just some of the base ingredients in Owen's Yummy Yo's.  No chemicals or By Products.  These pet treats are easy for your pet to digest and contribute to lasting health.  Owen's Yummy Yo's will freeze up to six months and still be tasty and enjoyable for your pet to eat.     Why We Need Your Help & What You Get 

Owen's Yummy Os's is run out of our home kitchen.  In order to increase our supply and grow our customer base so that more pets have the opportunity to eat healthy snacks we have to raise additional funds for larger ovens, storage and basic marketing.  


We are looking to raise $7,500 and If we achieve funding we will be able to provide products, increase our donations to ErinoakKids, a charitable organization in Ontario treating and providing support services for over 15,000 children with disabilities each year.
Specifically, we need:  A double oven Extra freezers
Packaging supplies (resealable bags, shipping supplies, etc.)
Product displays
Signs, flyers and other basic marketing

the importance of the rink to the community, representatives of the three

was put on ice last winter due to the sale of the Newport Yachting Center by
Newport Harbor Corporation to Scott’s Wharf.  In the spirit of cooperation, the Newport
Harbor Corporation has agreed to donate the skating rink equipment and assets to
Newport Waterfront Events while Scott’s Wharf is providing the Newport Skating
Center’s former space at the Newport Yachting Center for the coming skating
season.  Plans would be to have a full
schedule of activities this coming winter, including Family Fun Nights, Skates

including the Boys &amp; Girls Club and the Martin Luther King Jr. Community
Center and, of course, the grand opening and traditional Tree Lighting
ceremony.</p>

Center. “It is both exciting and comforting to know that the winter wonderland
could return along with the vibrancy to downtown that the rink helps to
create.  However, the final, critical
piece to make this a reality is to garner financial support from corporate partnerships
and the community to help fund the rink’s operations.  The rink operates at a loss annually due to
the extensive expenses to maintain it. 
In order for Newport Waterfront Events to take this on as a new company
we need extra help this year.”</p>

<p>NEWPORT, RI, November 17, 2015 – Newport Waterfront Events, a division of Waterfront Productions LLC, announces that although the Newport Skating Center fundraising campaign has yet to completely meet its goal there is enough confidence that additional funds will be received over the next few weeks to move forward with the return of the rink to its former downtown location at the Newport Yachting Center this upcoming winter season.  Michele Maker Palmieri, President and CEO of Waterfront Productions, the parent company of Newport Waterfront Events, reports that the generous response over the last month by the corporate community and individuals is truly inspiring, led by new presenting sponsor ALEX AND ANI.  Historically, Newport Waterfront Events has needed to sell a minimum of $150,000 in sponsorships to finance the rink’s operation and maintenance over a full winter season.</p>
<p>“ALEX AND ANI, all our other corporate sponsors, local organizations and individuals really came through to save the Skating Center and we are looking forward to celebrating with the entire community at the rink’s grand opening and tree lighting ceremony on Friday, December 11th,” said Palmieri.  “In the meantime, there is still more work to be done as we are at 93% of our fundraising goal with more sponsorship and partnership opportunities available, including dasher board signage.”  Palmieri added that a crowd sourcing campaign set up so the community can pledge funds via a link to Indiegogo.com on the skatenewport.com website is scheduled to end this Thursday, November 19th but will stay up and keep accepting donations.</p>
<p>“ALEX AND ANI is a company dedicated to its customers, its employees and its communities,” said Carolyn Rafaelian, Founder, Creative Director &amp; CEO of ALEX AND ANI.  “When there is an opportunity that creates a central place for people to enjoy our beautiful state, we are excited to commit our time and resources to the community to create unity for all to enjoy.”</p>

<p>Courtney Wilson, former Army Engineer Captain, Combat Veteran and Bronze Star Medal Recipient.  I've been featured in the New York Times, CNN and NPR for my experience as a female in Afghanistan.  I have my Master's in Management and Leadership and am currently getting my MBA at Babson College in MA.  When I got out of the military, I realized that there was not currently a quick, simple way to find out what civilian resources, benefits and programs were available to veterans.  Fortunately, the Army taught me never to complain about something without proposing a solution as well, and so, I created DropZone.  </p>

-President George Washington, Veteran

What You Need To Know There are 21.8 million veterans in America.  There are tens of thousands of civilian resources, programs and benefits available exclusively to veterans at little or no cost and yet less than half of veterans ever use a single resource that's available to them.  That means they're missing out on services that can benefit them personally, professionally, financially and emotionally.  I've benefitted  of a free 5-day healing retreat, a free 1-Year LinkedIn Premium Job Seeker ($390 Value), a free Annual Pass to National Parks ($80 Value), and free mentoring, career counseling and networking opportunities.  DropZone's mission is to ensure that ALL veterans benefit.    


What Is DropZone And How Does It Work? 
                                                  
DropZone is a location based mobile app that presents veterans with relevant civilian resources, programs and benefits in their area, all of which have been rated and reviewed by fellow veterans.  The resources are presented one at a time with a one sentence summary of what the resource is, does or offers.  If the user is not interested they swipe left.  If they are interested they swipe right and get more information, real time veteran's reviews and the resource contact information. 


Can I See DropZone In Action?
I thought you'd never ask.  DropZone is presented from 1:00-1:03  https://babson.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9d4bc3d0-76e0-484c-98ee-e3d242ac5f5a

<h3><strong><i>Help Marine, Air Force Veterans preserve historic property, launch winery</i></strong></h3>
<p>Hi, we are Andrew and Adelle Minerich.  We are asking for help to preserve a historic property and launch a winery in Beavercreek, OH.  We fell in love with this property and want to restore it. Then, we will create a winery and venue rental business that will sustain the property for years to come.  This business will become a valuable member of the community, hosting events, donating to charitable causes, and preserving the history of Beavercreek Township.</p>
<p><strong>*All contributions $50 and above get vouchers for free wine (see under perks)!*</strong></p>
<p><strong>The property:</strong></p>
<p>The 7-acre site includes a unique historical building, built in 1810 (<a href=""http://beavercreekhistoricalsociety.org/wordpress/the-old-stage-coach-inn-beavercreek-ohio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://beavercreekhistoricalsociety.org/wordpress/the-old-stage-coach-inn-beavercreek-ohio/</a>). It was part of the Underground Railroad and still has a hidden door in the kitchen, leading to hiding spaces under the front porch.  Abraham Lincoln may have stayed here during his presidential campaign.  It was also used as a Beavercreek high school in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century.  As part of our business, we will hire a historian to better research this property.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful property. The home was well-cared for by the owners, but it has sat vacant and is need of some updates and restoration.  We want to bring back that old Ohio feel.  The barn needs a bit more work to restore it, but, is large and will provide an excellent venue for rental.  The 7-acre site has plenty of space and can accommodate an additional building for wine-making, as well as some vines, a water feature, parking, and numerous seating areas.</p>
<p><strong>The business:</strong></p>
<p>We plan to launch a winery and venue rental business at this site, once restorations are complete.  Some vines will be grown on site, but, the majority of grapes will be sourced from other vineyards (Ohio, California, Washington, Oregon).  The wine-making would take place in a new steel building; this will allow us to turn the barn and Inn into tasting rooms and venue rental. In addition, we will rent out the buildings and property for weddings, parties, and other events.  We will also host community events, small concerts, food trucks, and a host of other fun happenings. We want this to be a gathering place for Beavercreek and the surrounding areas!</p>
<p>Other community events may include festivals, concert series, bring your dog nights, outdoor movies, charity fundraisers, 5Ks, vendor shows, etc. We also welcome your ideas!</p>
<p>We will have both the tasting room (home) and barn available for rental.  There will also be a gazebo and open spaces available.  It will be the perfect location for corporate functions, birthday parties, and even weddings!  We will partner with local caterers and rental companies to offer anything you may need.</p>
<p>At this time, we do not plan to offer more than appetizers. We will encourage our customers to have food delivered by local restaurants or purchase food from food trucks that we will invite to our site.</p>
<p>We have been making homemade wine and we have two renowned winery consultants that have agreed to work with us to ensure that we produce excellent wines.  I am also pursuing a Certified Specialist in Wine (CSW) certification.  We plan to offer traditional red and white varieties of wine, as well as fruit wines (our green apple Riesling and blackberry Pinot Noir are excellent!).  We also have years of experience drinking wine, as well as friends and family dedicated to making this happen!</p>

Hi, we are Andrew and Adelle Minerich.  We are asking for help to preserve a historic property and launch a winery in Beavercreek, OH.  We fell in love with this property and want to restore it. Then, we will create a winery and venue rental business that will sustain the property for years to come.  This business will become a valuable member of the community, hosting events, donating to charitable causes, and preserving the history of Beavercreek Township.
*All contributions $50 and above get vouchers for free wine (see under perks)!*
The property:
The 7-acre site includes a unique historical building, built in 1810 (http://beavercreekhistoricalsociety.org/wordpress/the-old-stage-coach-inn-beavercreek-ohio/). It was part of the Underground Railroad and still has a hidden door in the kitchen, leading to hiding spaces under the front porch.  Abraham Lincoln may have stayed here during his presidential campaign.  It was also used as a Beavercreek high school in the late 19th century.  As part of our business, we will hire a historian to better research this property.
This is a beautiful property. The home was well-cared for by the owners, but it has sat vacant and is need of some updates and restoration.  We want to bring back that old Ohio feel.  The barn needs a bit more work to restore it, but, is large and will provide an excellent venue for rental.  The 7-acre site has plenty of space and can accommodate an additional building for wine-making, as well as some vines, a water feature, parking, and numerous seating areas.

At this time, we do not plan to offer more than appetizers. We will encourage our customers to have food delivered by local restaurants or purchase food from food trucks that we will invite to our site.
We have been making homemade wine and we have two renowned winery consultants that have agreed to work with us to ensure that we produce excellent wines.  I am also pursuing a Certified Specialist in Wine (CSW) certification.  We plan to offer traditional red and white varieties of wine, as well as fruit wines (our green apple Riesling and blackberry Pinot Noir are excellent!).  We also have years of experience drinking wine, as well as friends and family dedicated to making this happen!
As for other Ohio wineries, there are a handful within Southwest Ohio, but none within the Dayton metro area.

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>THE BACKSTORY</strong></h3>
<p>We met almost 20 years ago in California while working for the same company. After becoming a couple, we spent many summers in Kelly's hometown of Upstate New York and our favorite place to go was a charming family entertainment center that drew crowds daily from miles away. It was then that we realized how unique their concept was and how much enjoyment it brought to the community.</p>
<p>We chose Petaluma, close to Jeff's hometown, to start our family and as our son grew we realized how often we had to travel for amusement and how much Petaluma would benefit from a family fun center. Recreating the relaxed yet sophisticated vibe of the center that Kelly grew up with while adding our own spin was the goal when we began the search for a great spot.  Luck was on our side when the perfect location also happened to have the proper zoning for Free Range to work. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:200px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542060412/ueyqvvxzherdb9lwbqzg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Now, we’re close to turning Free Range Mini Golf into reality.  We have 90% of our starting budget funded and we are hoping the community can help get us over the finish line. We want to open our doors this Summer - 2019.   </p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>SO WHAT'S THIS CAMPAIGN ALL ABOUT?</strong></h3>
<p>So, here's the thing: it's not easy to get this type of business off the ground (did you know that there are 6 different types of engineers?). In addition to refining our concept, creating the business plan, securing a location and all the associated permits, we've also spent the better part of this past year and a half raising funds to make Free Range the best it can be.  </p>
<p>This project is going to bring great things to the community and we are looking to the community to help us with the final push to bring it to life. Every dollar counts and any support you can provide is greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>After our goal is reached any additional funds raised will be used to create interactive art projects. <strong>So, Tee it high and let it fly!</strong></p>

<p>We are comprised of Black-centered organizations that are committed to racial justice and community through the provision of safe coworking and meeting space, resources, integrative wellness services, and community events. </p>
<p>The first step is done: we’ve secured a space in Richmond’s Northside community. </p>
<p><strong>But the work is far from over. </strong></p>

<p>Our building’s base rent (before utilities, insurance, and taxes) is $5,000. </p>
<p>Most small businesses fail due to overhead, and we are committed to pushing through this hurdle, but we need your help. </p>
<p>Our goal of raising $80,000 is to get us through the winter safely, and open our doors FULLY for coworking and events in the spring. This accounts for: </p>
<ul>
<li>Overhead for the building</li>
<li>Space renovation</li>
<li>Customizing for accessibility</li>
<li>Technology for community use</li>
<li>Offset of Indiegogo’s platform costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting in early 2021, we will begin renting out office space to individual organizations that are aligned with our values. Due to COVID-19 we will be holding only virtual and small,  limited-capacity &amp; socially-distanced events. We plan to open our coworking space when it is safe to do so, we are aiming for the spring of 2021 but will follow CDC, state, and local recommendations. </p>
<p>While we’re excited to hit the ground running in ways that are safe and accessible, the pandemic creates real barriers for our sustainability. </p>

<p><strong>What A Successful Campaign Will Mean For Richmond</strong></p>
<p>How many places can you name in Richmond that provide open, safe, and accessible space for Black and Queer folks to hang out? </p>
<p>What about spaces that have reasonable pricing for event and office rentals? </p>
<p>Or, coworking spaces run by and focused on the Black community offering reasonable rates?</p>
<p>Where can you find a variety of Black owned products in one central location, consistently? </p>
<p><strong>Yeah, we had a hard time creating a list too. </strong></p>
<p>For so long, we dreamed of curating a space for fellowship and to aid our community orgs and small businesses in their goals. We finally have that chance to realize those dreams, but we can only do it with your help!</p>
<p><strong>Efforts and programming that your contribution will support: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Safe and accessible space for QTPOC/BIPOC coworking and community</li>
<li>Social justice focused programming</li>
<li>Community resourcing needs</li>
<li>Black community centered social events</li>
<li>Writing workshops</li>
<li>Community gardening</li>
<li>Accessible arts &amp; craft events</li>
<li>QTPOC music events</li>
<li>Community childcare</li>
<li>Collaborative mutual aid</li>

We plan to open our coworking space when it is safe to do so, we are aiming for the spring of 2021 but will follow CDC, state, and local recommendations. 
While we’re excited to hit the ground running in ways that are safe and accessible, the pandemic creates real barriers for our sustainability. 
The Impact of a Black Centered Space in Richmond 

What A Successful Campaign Will Mean For Richmond
How many places can you name in Richmond that provide open, safe, and accessible space for Black and Queer folks to hang out? 
What about spaces that have reasonable pricing for event and office rentals? 
Or, coworking spaces run by and focused on the Black community offering reasonable rates?
Where can you find a variety of Black owned products in one central location, consistently? 
Yeah, we had a hard time creating a list too. 
For so long, we dreamed of curating a space for fellowship and to aid our community orgs and small businesses in their goals. We finally have that chance to realize those dreams, but we can only do it with your help!
Efforts and programming that your contribution will support: 

Safe and accessible space for QTPOC/BIPOC coworking and community
Social justice focused programming
Community resourcing needs
Black community centered social events
Writing workshops
Community gardening
Accessible arts & craft events
QTPOC music events
Community childcare
Collaborative mutual aid

And much more!

<p>Hello, my name is Tristina, and I was born &amp; raised in Easton, PA. I’m a Northampton Community College and Penn State grad. I’m a very hard worker. I’ve worked in healthcare most of my life, most recently in reproductive healthcare. Through my work in reproductive healthcare, I met so many different women. I would always find myself saying, “How you’re feeling is so common. We just never get to have these conversations.” I want to make those conversations more common, more affirming, and safe. I want to continue to be of help to the women in my community in a space where they can get the information they need, and perhaps from resources that aren’t easily found.</p>
<p>My campaign is an effort to raise money to open a Black bookstore that centers the needs of Black women and women of color. By centering the most marginalized, the needs of everyone are addressed. Bliggity is built on a foundation of Reproductive Justice and Ethical Capitalism.</p>
<p>According to SisterSong, Reproductive Justice is the theory that people have the human right "" to maintain bodily autonomy, to have or not have children, and parent the children we have in sustainable communities"". Goals of Bliggity, which are written into our business plan is to pay all employees a livable wage, use modified scheduling (ie. scheduling around school schedules, working from home) to maintain day-to-day operations, and create policies which respect the lived experiences of staff and customers.</p>
<p>Ethical Capitalism is a framework in which Bliggity is also based. ""Ethical Capitalism has at least two essential ingredients: A focus on creating long-term economic &amp; social value, and a commitment by business to act as stewards of the full spectrum of its customers, employees, suppliers, investors and society. Ethical Capitalism seeks to build deep, trust-based relationships in the service of society as well as the bottom line. In other words, it is a business model with a 'higher purpose.' "" (Huffington Post, 2014)<br/>Bliggity will contribute a percentage of monthly revenue to such organizations at The Free Black Woman's Library which is ""an interactive Black Feminist mobile trading library and interactive biblio installation that features a collection of 2000 books written by Black women. The library is committed to centering and celebrating the voices of Black Women in literature.""</p>
<p>Contributors to this campaign will help our whole community. Representation matters in society, and the local business community should be representative of the demographics of the city. Many Black people and people of color miss out on great local businesses, and the local business community misses out on revenue and feedback because residents don’t feel as though the area is for them. An increase in Black-owned businesses shows all residents that the community belongs to everyone.</p>
<p>I am seeking $25,000 to lease a retail space in Downtown Easton, create a beautiful, workable environment that functions well for patrons, and purchase a point of sale system. Independent bookstores are showing record turnarounds in sales and support compared to just 10 years ago. I am hoping to fund this project using crowdfunding as many others have done. I am asking my community to support me in my efforts to be a Black woman-owned bookstore.</p>
<p>In return for your investment in Bliggity, I am offering a variety of perks and packages ranging from $10 to $500. Please choose what makes you most comfortable.</p>
<p>In the event that the entire goal is not met, all funds raised will be put toward completing an online Bliggity bookstore.</p>
<p>Bliggity will be a space for everyone to enjoy. That is one of the reasons why I feel it is important that I find a retail space in Downtown Easton. I would like to make the store easily accessible for as many people as possible. The Downtown area is walkable, has easy access to public transportation, and plenty of parking. The space will feature work by Black writers and writers of color. I want to provide feature sections that uplift Black scientists, thriller writers, LGBTQ+ writers, etc.</p>
<p>There are several Black bookstores all across the United States, but none within a 50 mile radius of the Lehigh Valley. Marc Lamont Hill opened a Black bookstore in Philadelphia in November 2017. The Lit Bar of Bronx, NY and Source of Knowledge Book Store of Newark, NJ are two more examples of successful Black bookstores. All of these stores have received tremendous support from and have been a great resource for their communities. La Casa Azul Bookstore in East Harlem, NY was able to raise $35,000 in just 40 days using this very platform in order to open their first store in 2012.</p>
<p>According to the Small Business Administration, most new businesses fail in the first year. I have a SCORE Mentor through Lehigh Valley SCORE. I’ve already been in contact with the Easton Main Street Initiative, and I joined the Easton Business Association. I have also taken courses available through the SBDC at Lehigh University. I’m confident in my abilities to help my business succeed and grow, and I know who to reach out to for help if I need it.</p>
<p>As a director in a healthcare facility I learned that diversifying income streams is essential to the success of businesses. Bliggity will be a bookstore, and we will also have apparel and jewelry for sale, handmade crafts; and select teas and tea accessories. Once per month we will have an open mic night where readers can read from their favorite books. And with being in such a college rich area, I’m hoping that we can host visiting creatives of color.<br/> </p>
<p>If you can’t spare any money, I completely understand. Please share my Indiegogo page and/or like &amp; share from our Facebook and Instagram pages. Thank you so much for all of your support- Tristina</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Owner - Cayla Broughton, Senior Accountant at an American energy company based in Tulsa, OK. I received my Bachelors in Business Administration with a concentration in Accounting from Langston University and a Masters in Business Administration from Northeastern State University.</li>
<li>I've always loved the experience of getting pampered and my nails done with my girlfriends and family since the age of 15. When I moved to the Tulsa area, it was hard to find a consistent salon that valued its customers, maintained consistent and affordable pricing, and could duplicate the picture/example of what I brought to them for my nails. With Nails by Noelle, I want to create a space where anyone can come to get nails and waxing services all in one place while in a comfortable, relaxing, and fun environment.</li>
<li>Your contribution will help support our mission to provide high-quality customer, nails, and waxing services at affordable prices and convenient hours.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Due to high start-up costs, 40% of the total startup amount will be funded with contributions from the Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, 28% with our business credit and the remaining 32% will be funded from a small business loan. Funding will be used on items such as the business location, salon equipment, supplies, inventory, insurance, building improvements, marketing, a POS system, signage, and a responsive website.</li>
<li>I am asking backers to give $10 or more if they are able to, if not anything is greatly appreciated! Some of the perks we have included with your contribution of $20 or more are a digital thank you, a loyalty card with your 1st purchase stamp included, a Nails by Noelle T-Shirt, and the opportunity to host your own salon party! With the digital thank you, we will personally shout you out on our social media and website pages, or of course, you can opt-out of a public shout out. The way our loyalty cards work is on your 11th visit, you can receive your services FREE after filling your card. Each space can be filled by purchasing $25 or more in services on each visit. The T-shirt is an exclusive Nails by Noelle T-Shirt with our logo on a black tee.  Lastly, you will get the opportunity to host your own private, salon party which includes mani/pedi services for up to 10 guests!</li>
<li>Don't fret, if we don't reach our campaign goal we will shift our ratio of mixed funding amounts (crowd-funding to small business loan to credit) as necessary, however, our ultimate goal is to exceed our crowdfunding goal and have to decrease the asking amount for our small business loan, or not even need a small business loan at all! </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our values are 1) Safety - by providing the safest products along with maintaining the best sanitary practices, 2) Quality - we provide top quality products, as well as employees who have gone through professional development and taken the time to continuously perfect their craft, 3) Service -  by providing not only quality customer service but unique services designed with our guests in mind, 4) Community - we plan to serve our community once established with volunteer days and complimentary services, and 5) Culture - Nails by Noelle is a whole vibe, y'all!</li>
<li>For measurement purposes, there are approximately 994,000 people in the Tulsa Metro area (this includes Broken Arrow, Owasso, Jenks, and other surrounding areas) based on the latest Census Reporter information available. Of the 994,000, 51% are women. Also, based on the 2017 ""Black Women Business Startups Report"" (<a href=""https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/community/blackwomenbusinessesreport.pdf?la=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/community/blackwomenbusinessesreport.pdf?la=en</a>) which consisted of focus groups conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, ""the growth rate of business ownership by black women has been faster than any other group in the nation."" The report summarizes the startup motivation, challenges, support, and recommendations from black women business owners. An impactful takeaway from the study is that 6% of black women business owners utilized external financing to startup, of the amount of business financing received based on the amount requested - 40% received none of the amount requested, 37% received some of the amount requested, and 22% received all of the amount requested. Another thing to note for startup support, many black women business owners credit their friends and family, social network, and mentors as key individuals in their success. I truly believe THIS is how your contribution to the “Help Support Nails by Noelle LLC” campaign will make a difference, I thank you in advance for your support!  </li>

<h2><strong>Cat Lady &amp; Proud of it!!</strong></h2>
<p>I have had a long-term loving relationship with rescue cats.  I adopted my first rescue cat, Hannibal, not long after I moved to Phoenix in 1990.  Over the years since then, I have provided a loving home to a total of 11 cats.  I now have a kitty family of seven cats including one special needs kitty, Harley.</p>
<p>In 2017 I was gifted with a visit to Kit Tea Cat Café in San Francisco.  I came away thinking, “I could do that!  What a wonderful way to bring people and adoptable cats together!”</p>
<p>In 2019, I retired from my fulltime position to develop and launch Kitty Pause Kitty Café. </p>
<h3>What is Kitty Pause Kitty Café?</h3>
<p>Kitty Pause will be a hub for cat-centered activities designed to create a sense of joyfulness for both the visitors and the cats.  It is planned as a cat and people friendly space where you can meet, play, and cuddle with the cats who reside at Kitty Pause while looking for their fur-ever homes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607633085/nydgpkdvgp2qqsqhelzd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Kitty Pause will be an adoption center for Saving One Life, our rescue partner.  You can get to know a potential new kitty member for your family in a great open setting. You also can engage in activities such as Yoga with Cats, Bingo with Cats and many more.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><strong>Come join the Kitty Pause family!</strong>  <strong><i>Let’s make it happen together!</i></strong></p>
<h3>COVID Created Circumstances. . .</h3>
<p>Due to the COVID situation and the newness of cat cafes in the U.S. in general, it has been a challenge to obtain the funds needed to renovate and build out the space that I leased back in February for Kitty Pause in the Pavilions Shopping Center in Mesa, AZ. </p>
<p><strong>Where things stand. . .</strong></p>
<p>I have obtained a commitment for a $75,000 SBA loan to help cover a portion of the renovation expenses that include construction of a needed wall to separate the cat lounge space from the welcome entry and boutique, furnishings for the lounge to include cat and people furniture, and outside signage for the suite.  The total estimated expenses to open Kitty Pause are $150,000. </p>
<p>The SBA is requiring that I have the additional needed $75,000 to cover the balance of the renovations.  To date I have already invested $30,000 in startup expenses since February.  I plan to invest an additional $25,000 from my retirement funds to make Kitty Pause happen. </p>
<p>My goal is to open in March 2021. For that to happen, I need to raise the additional $50,000.</p>
<p><strong>That’s where you can help to make Kitty Pause a reality!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Join the Kitty Pause Kitty Krew by donating to the renovation fund!  </strong>Kitty Pause will be a great community resource and a hub for feline fun and activity.</p>
<p><strong><i>Please share the campaign</i> </strong>with friends and family who are also cat lovers.<strong>  Let’s grow a ground swell of support for Kitty Pause Kitty Café and raise the needed funds </strong>so we are ready to welcome you and your friends when you come to visit<strong>!</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Check out the list of perks</i></strong> I am offering to thank you for your donation as you decide the amount of your donation.  A number of the items are from my personal art collection that I thought you might enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for sharing my vision for Kitty Pause Kitty Café,</strong> for spreading the word about the campaign and for helping to create of a wonderful space where you and your friends can come visit and play with friendly felines looking for fur-ever homes!</p>

In 2017 I was gifted with a visit to Kit Tea Cat Café in San Francisco.  I came away thinking, “I could do that!  What a wonderful way to bring people and adoptable cats together!”
In 2019, I retired from my fulltime position to develop and launch Kitty Pause Kitty Café. 
What is Kitty Pause Kitty Café?
Kitty Pause will be a hub for cat-centered activities designed to create a sense of joyfulness for both the visitors and the cats.  It is planned as a cat and people friendly space where you can meet, play, and cuddle with the cats who reside at Kitty Pause while looking for their fur-ever homes.

Kitty Pause will be an adoption center for Saving One Life, our rescue partner.  You can get to know a potential new kitty member for your family in a great open setting. You also can engage in activities such as Yoga with Cats, Bingo with Cats and many more.
 
Come join the Kitty Pause family!  Let’s make it happen together!
COVID Created Circumstances. . .
Due to the COVID situation and the newness of cat cafes in the U.S. in general, it has been a challenge to obtain the funds needed to renovate and build out the space that I leased back in February for Kitty Pause in the Pavilions Shopping Center in Mesa, AZ. 
Where things stand. . .
I have obtained a commitment for a $75,000 SBA loan to help cover a portion of the renovation expenses that include construction of a needed wall to separate the cat lounge space from the welcome entry and boutique, furnishings for the lounge to include cat and people furniture, and outside signage for the suite.  The total estimated expenses to open Kitty Pause are $150,000. 
The SBA is requiring that I have the additional needed $75,000 to cover the balance of the renovations.  To date I have already invested $30,000 in startup expenses since February.  I plan to invest an additional $25,000 from my retirement funds to make Kitty Pause happen. 
My goal is to open in March 2021. For that to happen, I need to raise the additional $50,000.
That’s where you can help to make Kitty Pause a reality!
Join the Kitty Pause Kitty Krew by donating to the renovation fund!  Kitty Pause will be a great community resource and a hub for feline fun and activity.
Please share the campaign with friends and family who are also cat lovers.  Let’s grow a ground swell of support for Kitty Pause Kitty Café and raise the needed funds so we are ready to welcome you and your friends when you come to visit!
Check out the list of perks I am offering to thank you for your donation as you decide the amount of your donation.  A number of the items are from my personal art collection that I thought you might enjoy.
Thank you for sharing my vision for Kitty Pause Kitty Café, for spreading the word about the campaign and for helping to create of a wonderful space where you and your friends can come visit and play with friendly felines looking for fur-ever homes!
Check out the Kitty Pause Kitty Café website or join us on Facebook.
I am very grateful for your support as are the kitties who will make Kitty Pause their home while they await adoption.
Thank you!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>t 2Fer Fun we are a small group of friends who have a dream. Our dream is to see the 2Fer Fun App used worldwide. We believe that, together, we have what it takes to get this project off of the ground. </span></p>
<p>So what is 2Fer Fun App? It's an app that turns any 2 for 1 coupon into a social experience. A person who has a 2 for 1 coupon can build a profile and list what experience they have to share and who they want to share it with, a new friend or date or even a local dog walker. The shared experience could be a movie, dinner, bowling, rides at a theme park, skydiving, coffee, getting their nails done, lazer tag, literally anything that has a 2 for 1 coupon. Anyone who downloads the free app version would be able to see what is on offer in their area. The two would then contact each other privately to arrange when to meet. Businesses could also buy an upgrade to have their coupons listed in the app. We think that it is a pretty great idea, but so do others who have more resources than us. We need your help.</p>
<p>The big guys over at Ideaapps, Inc have offered to buy 49% of our app, which we originally thought was pretty great. We decided not to move forward because they wanted to make 2Fer Fun a publically traded company. We declinded because we don't ever want to lose sight of what's important, and that is you and your experience. Now, the clock is ticking to get 2Fer Fun App to market before Ideaapps steals the idea and creates something similar. The agreements we have with them allow us six months to bring our technology to market before they can use the idea. </p>
<p>That is why we need your help today. We have been working hard to see how we can get a quality app to market before Ideaapps contract a company out of India build a similar app. If we get an additional $5k from funding of some sort, whether it be with Indiegogo or orther outside sources, we will have enough funding to get the app to market. We would use any additional monies earned to market the app in other countries, until we have reached the dream of worldwide downloads. </p>
<p>So please, pretty please, help us out by getting your download code today. It costs $1 to get the code to download the App on the day it launches. That small amount will be used to launch our dream. It takes less than two minutes and it could literally help shape the world. Please click the link below and go to the $1 Perk.</p>
<p> We Thank you in advance!</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/2fer-Fun-App-development-social#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/2fer-Fun-App...</a></p>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Our founders come from the Seattle, Washington area, which is a hub for technology. Seattle, Washington is home to businesses such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon just to name a few. Over the years our members have seen first hand how technology can literally shape the world we live in. As we have seen, the idea of saving money with coupons has grown into a multimillion industry with apps like Groupon boasting over 115 million subscribers. We have also seen social media grow beyond possible count with sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter literally becoming a part of each of our daily lives. </p>
<p>The 2Fer Fun App combines these two phenomenon by allowing anyone that has a 2 for 1 coupon to create a profile, list what experience they have to share and who they want to share it with. This could be a new friend, a potential love interest or even a local dog walker. They can then be contacted by anyone who would like to share the experience with them whether it be a movie, dinner, bowling, rides at a theme park, skydiving, coffee, or really anything at all.</p>
<p>We think the only thing better than having a social experience is getting to have a social experience for free. That is why we will put the 2Fer Fun App in the world's back pocket for free!</p>
<p>The team at 2Fer Fun are professionals that each bring their own talent to the table. Our backgrounds are diverse, from customer service, to hands on production, to owning their own business. We are a well rounded and resourceful group who don't mind working hard to meet our goal of bringing the 2Fer Fun App to the world.</p>
<h3>App Overview</h3>
<p>2Fer Fun is an application that turns any 2 for 1 coupon into a social experience. People can get together for a meal, a movie, bowling, rides at a theme park, almost anything that has been offered by a business on a 2 for 1 basis. Best of all they get to do it at half of the normal cost! People can meet a new date, a new friend or even a local dog walker. The options are endless. </p>
<p><strong>How it works </strong><br/>A user who has a 2 for 1 coupon can build a small profile about who they are. They will then be able to list what experience they have on offer and who they would like to share the experience with, a new friend, a new date, or even someone who likes sunsets. It is completely up to them. Their profile would then be open to see for free by any user who downloads the app. If someone wants to share the experience they would contact the person directly to determine when they would like to meet. This part of the app would be free, as would all ""social type"" experiences such as a Broadway show, ride on a tour bus, get dinner, see a movie, go bowling, play golf, go scuba diving, whale watching, etc.</p>
<p>For a fee of 99 cents a user will be able to participate in largerscale and higher value 2 for 1 offers such as T-Mobiles 2 for 1 phone service, a 2 for 1 vacation package and other similar deals. Likewise if they would like to list some type of ""hard item"" (like 2 for 1 clothings offers, school supplies, buy one pair of shoes get 1 free pair, etc.) they will be able to with the upgrade.<br/>In app ads will support the app. A user can remove the ads by purchasing an upgrade for 99 cents.<br/>Any business that would like to increase their reach using the app, on their terms, will be offered the ability to do so. For a one time fee of $21 a business would have the ability to create a landing page that includes their offers, their information, a link to their website, a link to their social media pages, and their logo. They would have the ability to pay a monthly fee of  $11 to change the coupon as many times as they would like during a 30 day period. This can help substantially increase their business, and business awareness, by staying active with the app. They will also have the ability to increase business on the days and at the times they want based on the way they structure their offer.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $25,000 USD to continue branding, developing and marketing the technology that we've got. The 2Fer Fun App will continue to evolve in this direction and we will use the funds to get our app into the pockets of millions of people worldwide. That is why we give everyone the initial version of 2Fer Fun App for free- we are looking to create a global movement of people sharing experiences while saving money AND giving businesses an opportunity to boost their customer reach in the process. We see this as a win-win for everyone.</p>
<p>2Fer Fun operates on a digital medium so we thought that offering digital perks is the best way to get you involved!</p>
<p>Our rewards and incentives are as diverse as our investors. They inculde:</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">》Shout outs on our social media pages</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">》 Thank yous on our website </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">》 Free app upgrade</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">》 The opportunity to meet the 2Fer Fun App board to share your insights on building the 2Fer Fun app and expansion </span></p>
<p>》Two tickets to our exclusive launch party in Seattle </p>
<p>If our funding goal isn't met we will reorganize our launch strategy and find a to persevere. We want the world to have 2Fer Fun App in their pockets and to use it everyday.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Although everyone has their own way to have fun, they will have more while sharing that experience with someone new for free. Our app helps people to connect AND it helps businesses to connect with new customers. The benefits to users is that they get the opportunity to meet someone new without financial risk- if the connection just isn’t there no one is out too much cash. The benefits to a businesse is that they can expand their reach and on their terms. If a restaurant needs to sell more meals on Tuesday nights then they can create a coupon tailored for our users to get them in to their business on Tuesday nights. Our unique team to build an app like something not yet seen in the app world. We  believe that 2Fer Fun has the ability to shape the world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although the area of app development is nothing new, this concept of combing social media with the group of people using apps like Groupon is. With that comes risks and new challenges to be faced. There is no template for what we are creating. We also have major brands and corporations that have seen the value of our idea and who will try to reach the market before we do and with far more resources. Already, Ideaapps has offered to buy 49% of 2Fer Fun with the goal of making it a publically traded company. The agreements we have with them allow us six months to bring our technology to market before they can use the idea behind the 2Fer Fun App. We are a small group of friends and not a big company like ideaapps. We NEED your support to see our dream come true. </p>
<p>We realize that these are significant challenges but our team is ready to face them and bring 2Fer Fun App to market successfully. </p>
</div><div>

<p>If contributing financially is not possible for you but you still believe in our project and want to make a difference, please share this with as many people as you can by email or on your social media feeds. We want the world to know about 2Fer Fun App and we need your help to get there!</p>

A person who has a 2 for 1 coupon can build a profile and list what experience they have to share and who they want to share it with, a new friend or date or even a local dog walker. The shared experience could be a movie, dinner, bowling, rides at a theme park, skydiving, coffee, getting their nails done, lazer tag, literally anything that has a 2 for 1 coupon. Anyone who downloads the free app version would be able to see what is on offer in their area. The two would then contact each other privately to arrange when to meet. Businesses could also buy an upgrade to have their coupons listed in the app. We think that it is a pretty great idea, but so do others who have more resources than us. We need your help.
The big guys over at Ideaapps, Inc have offered to buy 49% of our app, which we originally thought was pretty great. We decided not to move forward because they wanted to make 2Fer Fun a publically traded company. We declinded because we don't ever want to lose sight of what's important, and that is you and your experience. Now, the clock is ticking to get 2Fer Fun App to market before Ideaapps steals the idea and creates something similar. The agreements we have with them allow us six months to bring our technology to market before they can use the idea. 
That is why we need your help today. We have been working hard to see how we can get a quality app to market before Ideaapps contract a company out of India build a similar app. If we get an additional $5k from funding of some sort, whether it be with Indiegogo or orther outside sources, we will have enough funding to get the app to market. We would use any additional monies earned to market the app in other countries, until we have reached the dream of worldwide downloads. 
So please, pretty please, help us out by getting your download code today. It costs $1 to get the code to download the App on the day it launches. That small amount will be used to launch our dream. It takes less than two minutes and it could literally help shape the world. Please click the link below and go to the $1 Perk.
 We Thank you in advance!

About Us
Our founders come from the Seattle, Washington area, which is a hub for technology. Seattle, Washington is home to businesses such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon just to name a few. Over the years our members have seen first hand how technology can literally shape the world we live in. As we have seen, the idea of saving money with coupons has grown into a multimillion industry with apps like Groupon boasting over 115 million subscribers. We have also seen social media grow beyond possible count with sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter literally becoming a part of each of our daily lives. 
The 2Fer Fun App combines these two phenomenon by allowing anyone that has a 2 for 1 coupon to create a profile, list what experience they have to share and who they want to share it with. This could be a new friend, a potential love interest or even a local dog walker. They can then be contacted by anyone who would like to share the experience with them whether it be a movie, dinner, bowling, rides at a theme park, skydiving, coffee, or really anything at all.
We think the only thing better than having a social experience is getting to have a social experience for free. That is why we will put the 2Fer Fun App in the world's back pocket for free!
The team at 2Fer Fun are professionals that each bring their own talent to the table. Our backgrounds are diverse, from customer service, to hands on production, to owning their own business. We are a well rounded and resourceful group who don't mind working hard to meet our goal of bringing the 2Fer Fun App to the world.
App Overview
2Fer Fun is an application that turns any 2 for 1 coupon into a social experience. People can get together for a meal, a movie, bowling, rides at a theme park, almost anything that has been offered by a business on a 2 for 1 basis. Best of all they get to do it at half of the normal cost! People can meet a new date, a new friend or even a local dog walker. The options are endless. 
How it works A user who has a 2 for 1 coupon can build a small profile about who they are. They will then be able to list what experience they have on offer and who they would like to share the experience with, a new friend, a new date, or even someone who likes sunsets. It is completely up to them. Their profile would then be open to see for free by any user who downloads the app. If someone wants to share the experience they would contact the person directly to determine when they would like to meet. This part of the app would be free, as would all ""social type"" experiences such as a Broadway show, ride on a tour bus, get dinner, see a movie, go bowling, play golf, go scuba diving, whale watching, etc.
For a fee of 99 cents a user will be able to participate in largerscale and higher value 2 for 1 offers such as T-Mobiles 2 for 1 phone service, a 2 for 1 vacation package and other similar deals. Likewise if they would like to list some type of ""hard item"" (like 2 for 1 clothings offers, school supplies, buy one pair of shoes get 1 free pair, etc.) they will be able to with the upgrade.In app ads will support the app. A user can remove the ads by purchasing an upgrade for 99 cents.Any business that would like to increase their reach using the app, on their terms, will be offered the ability to do so. For a one time fee of $21 a business would have the ability to create a landing page that includes their offers, their information, a link to their website, a link to their social media pages, and their logo. They would have the ability to pay a monthly fee of  $11 to change the coupon as many times as they would like during a 30 day period. This can help substantially increase their business, and business awareness, by staying active with the app. They will also have the ability to increase business on the days and at the times they want based on the way they structure their offer.

What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise $25,000 USD to continue branding, developing and marketing the technology that we've got. The 2Fer Fun App will continue to evolve in this direction and we will use the funds to get our app into the pockets of millions of people worldwide. That is why we give everyone the initial version of 2Fer Fun App for free- we are looking to create a global movement of people sharing experiences while saving money AND giving businesses an opportunity to boost their customer reach in the process. We see this as a win-win for everyone.
2Fer Fun operates on a digital medium so we thought that offering digital perks is the best way to get you involved!
Our rewards and incentives are as diverse as our investors. They inculde:
》Shout outs on our social media pages
》 Thank yous on our website 
》 Free app upgrade
》 The opportunity to meet the 2Fer Fun App board to share your insights on building the 2Fer Fun app and expansion 
》Two tickets to our exclusive launch party in Seattle 
If our funding goal isn't met we will reorganize our launch strategy and find a to persevere. We want the world to have 2Fer Fun App in their pockets and to use it everyday.

The Impact
Although everyone has their own way to have fun, they will have more while sharing that experience with someone new for free. Our app helps people to connect AND it helps businesses to connect with new customers. The benefits to users is that they get the opportunity to meet someone new without financial risk- if the connection just isn’t there no one is out too much cash. The benefits to a businesse is that they can expand their reach and on their terms. If a restaurant needs to sell more meals on Tuesday nights then they can create a coupon tailored for our users to get them in to their business on Tuesday nights. Our unique team to build an app like something not yet seen in the app world. We  believe that 2Fer Fun has the ability to shape the world. 

Risks & Challenges
Although the area of app development is nothing new, this concept of combing social media with the group of people using apps like Groupon is. With that comes risks and new challenges to be faced. There is no template for what we are creating. We also have major brands and corporations that have seen the value of our idea and who will try to reach the market before we do and with far more resources. Already, Ideaapps has offered to buy 49% of 2Fer Fun with the goal of making it a publically traded company. The agreements we have with them allow us six months to bring our technology to market before they can use the idea behind the 2Fer Fun App. We are a small group of friends and not a big company like ideaapps. We NEED your support to see our dream come true. 
We realize that these are significant challenges but our team is ready to face them and bring 2Fer Fun App to market successfully. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If contributing financially is not possible for you but you still believe in our project and want to make a difference, please share this with as many people as you can by email or on your social media feeds. We want the world to know about 2Fer Fun App and we need your help to get there!

<p align=""center""><strong><a href=""http://frailtymyths.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Frailty Myths</a> is a dream that began as a group of friends imagining a space for women that was as powerful and supportive as that friendship.</strong></p>
<p>Frailty Myths is a non-profit that offers an array of workshops that train women in traditionally male-dominated activities like welding, construction, climbing, art, and sailing. Each workshop offers hands-on skill building as well as facilitated discussions that examine the learning experience and how societal myths have kept women from actively participating in these spaces. Frailty Myths workshops aim to empower women to recognize and dispel the myths of frailty through dialogue and exploration of our physical capabilities.</p>
<p>This October, our dream became a reality when we launched the first Frailty Myths workshop series. Within days, over 300 women registered for our first workshop through our website and over 1500 women expressed interest. We have hosted 5 successful woodworking workshops that over 75 women attended and left with not only a step stool they'd made themselves, but also feeling empowered and supported.</p>
<p>So far we’ve done this entire process on our own. Everything that we have created, from the 501(c)(3), to the website and the workshops, has been self-created and self-funded by our leadership team.</p>
<p>We are ready to take the next step and provide these workshops to women across the country-- but we need your help. Please donate now. We can't get there without your help and support and every little bit gets us closer to the world we're working to build.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">“By developing her power to the fullest, any woman, from Olympics star to the weekend tennis player, can be a match for any man she chooses to take on. More importantly, she will inherit the essential source of human self-confidence – pride and control over a finely tuned body.

<p>We believe through our own experiences that when women discover and re-discover their physical capabilities, our bodies and minds become stronger. When we realize we are strong and capable, we also embrace our independence, our leadership capabilities, and our ability to stand up for ourselves and for others.</p>
<p>Our project seeks to outreach and hold space for those who do not identify as men. We hope to create a community and network including members of the trans and gender non-conforming communities. </p>

<div>
<p>Remember what it was like becoming a car owner for the very first
time? The shopper’s high in hand-selecting the perfect set of
wheels? The sense of accomplishment after finally closing the deal?
The sudden surge of newfound empowerment and freedom you felt
leaping into the driver’s seat, gripping the wheel, and fantasizing
about the endless possibilities of hightailing it wherever you want,
whenever you want?</p>
<p><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Then you wake up and experienced the inevitable, emotional gear-
shift not long after the initial honeymoon phase has burned up its
fuel. The expensive monthly bills and insurance premiums, the
maintenance, the regular oil changes and rising gas costs, the
overpriced repair bills – all begin to kill that dream.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Do you know what your car actually costs you every month? Do you
know how much you pay for each mile you drive? When asked
about their monthly car costs, most people only consider their car
payment, which on average is around $482. But that $482 isn’t the
whole cost to own that car — far from it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">We almost always overlook all the other sneaky car-related leaks
from our wallets. We have license fees, registration fees and taxes.
We need to buy insurance, fill the gas tank, go in for regular
maintenance. And our cars lose value from depreciation every day
we own it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">These other costs could well end up doubling our out-of-pocket
expenses. That’s NUTS! Especially given the fact that we drive our
cars, on average, 56 minutes a day - that’s just 4% of the time! </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We realized too that our cars that used to be the ultimate symbol of
freedom and independence are actually really lousy assets to own.
And it turns out we’re not alone.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">There are over 100 million households in the US who own 230
million cars. We collectively spend over $1.5 TRILLION (yes, that’s a
T) on our cars. We started YOYO because believe that as much as a
third of this money that we consumers spend is just fat in a
ridiculously inefficient system. To add insult to injury, it's a rigged
system and the inefficiencies are totally artificial.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The reality is that more and more folks like you look at car ownership
as an expensive burden more than anything else. You value your
time over physical assets. That’s exactly why Uber, Lyft, ZipCar, and
other modern transportation alternatives are taking off like
gangbusters.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">The times certainly are a-changin’ and the sharing economy is taking
hold fast and furious throughout the United States -- but relying on
these kinds of services on a full-time basis just isn’t doable for most
consumers’ pocketbooks. </span></p>

<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;display: inline !important;font-weight: normal;"">Here’s what YOYO members stand to gain from our service:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Complete on-demand, flexible access to an entire fleet of cars.</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">With YoYo, you can take a sedan to the office during the week, trade
it for an SUV for the family camping trip over the weekend, and then
swap it out for a convertible to escort your better half on a swanky
night out on the town. Or for you single parents out there, while that
minivan is perfectly practical for shuttling the kids around, wouldn’t it
be great if you could roll up to your date’s house in something just a
little bit sexier? The options are limitless.</span></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">A hassle-free, white-glove concierge service.</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We’ll send out a YOYO agent to deliver your selected set of wheels
right to you -- whenever you want, wherever you are. When you’re
finished with it, you can either drop it off at our place or press a
button and one of our agents will pick it up for you -- with an option
to swap out for a different car, if it strikes your fancy.</span></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Savings</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">YOYO members are completely free from purchasing, financing,
insurance, repair, maintenance, DMV registrations, airport parking --
virtually all of the wallet-gouging expenses common to personal car
ownership. You save hundreds over all other alternatives for the
same car, and it’s completely predictable. You get to free up money
for stuff that really matters to you.</span></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Pay-per-mile driving</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Our members only pay for the miles that they actually drive. Want to
enjoy a lazy Sunday indoors to catch up on your Netflix? With YOYO,
you can keep your options open while keeping your wallet closed --
because never again will you have to pay a single penny for an idle
car. With YOYO, the family car is finally a true utility that you can turn
on and off whenever you want. That’s a luxury that peer-to-peer
services and traditional car ownership simply CAN’T offer.</span></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Referral rewards</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">YOYO makes it possible for our members to drive completely for free
over time. Any time you refer one of your friends or family members
to YOYO, you will receive recurring credits and bonuses to lower your
cost of driving. The more people you refer, the more points you earn.</span></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Peace of mind</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">By letting go of car ownership you’re actually back in the driver’s
seat. Has sort of a Zen ring to it, doesn’t it? The family car is now a
true utility – you can turn it on or off on demand.</span></p>
<h4><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></b></h4>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Flexible Pricing Plans. No Surprises.</b></h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Choose the car that works for you. Our pricing is flexible and totally
variable so you can get, and pay for, exactly what you need. No
decoder ring required. </span></p>

<h4><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></h4>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Our Story</span></h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The concept of YOYO was conceived a year ago when Ro’s (one of
the founders) car broke down. Like most consumers not adept with
the complexities of the modern car engine, he was at the mercy of
the repair shop and facing a very large bill. Ro approached his co-
founder Hari, his long-time colleague and go-to auto guru. Hari
intervened and saved him from being taken for thousands of dollars.
After this experience, it became clear to both of them that the car
ownership model is massively broken because of pervasive and
totally artificial information asymmetry at every node in the value
chain. The two began studying the inefficiencies and gaps that exist
in the automotive industry that always seem to put consumers at a
disadvantage. Their attempt to dissolve all the car-related
headaches for the consumer and disrupt a 100-year old ‘broken’ car
consumption model eventually led to the formation and launch of
YOYO.</span></p>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What we have found is that despite all the “car disruption” noise out
there, people are still facing the headaches that come with personal
car ownership. We believe this is an acute problem worth solving in a
massive market, and we have the right DNA to do it.</span></div>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">You see, we at YOYO are going to blow the doors off anything
you’ve seen before. We’re offering some crazy perks in celebration
of our exciting new announcements.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We have a number of exciting developments in the works that are
laying the groundwork for big things to come in 2017. Here’s a look
at what we’ve accomplished with YOYO so far:</span></p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Product</b></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Much of the heavy lifting is already done. Our customer-facing app
is almost ready, and the backend server stuff that will power our
service is next on our to-do list. We’ll be ready to deliver cars to our
members in just a couple of months after this campaign closes.</span></p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Building Relationships</b></div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><div style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our stable of procurement, insurance, logistics, technology
development, and marketing partners includes the biggest names in
the automotive industry. They are excited to work with us and have a
huge physical and operational footprint in the markets we want to
serve. This will help us scale without the need for expensive
infrastructure. Unlike other asset-heavy car startups, YoYo will only
need a fraction of the capital to reach our goal of serving 1 million
members in the next 5 years.</span></div></span>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">That’s Awesome—But Why Am I Reading This On
Indiegogo?</span></h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Crowdfunding is the perfect way to bring you this unique service,
and Indiegogo is the perfect platform to facilitate pre-sales of YOYO
memberships in celebration of the next chapter in our journey.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We've set a modest goal of $25,000 for this campaign. These are not revenue $'s in the sense that we'll spend towards the development of the service (in fact we're going to escrow most of the funds and make them refundable. Please see below). Our primary objective of this campaign is social proof. In other words, your support enables us to show investors that there’s a market for this service and customers are voting with their wallets. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We’re offering you membership perks at a special price that is
exclusive to this campaign. Not to mention some really nutso no-
brainer perks that we don’t think we’ll ever repeat anywhere. Check

<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">To thank you for helping us reach our goals, we’ve decided to do something really crazy! Instead of just getting free memberships and t-shirts and trips, we’re going to DRAMATICALLY lower your cost of driving permanently. I mean, that’s the whole point here, right? A better (and cheaper) way to drive, right? So we figured we’d go all out for our supporters and do just that. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">For each stretch goal we hit (see image below), we knock 10% of your cost of driving with YOYO. What this means is, the crowd (that’s you folks) collectively works to lower the cost of driving for everyone in the crowd. For example, if you as our tribe help us reach the modest goal of $150,000, as our token of appreciation, everyone who contributes $100 or over during this campaign will pay ONLY HALF as much as anyone else who joins outside of this campaign. I bet you that’s way lower than what you’re paying for your car right now. Don’t miss this chance for saving literally hundreds of dollars every month for as long as you’re a YOYO member. And we don’t intend to repeat this craziness ever again. Please support us and lock in your lifetime driving discounts.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We have a rock solid team that is 100% behind this effort. Given the gray hair and decades of experience each of us brings to the table, we are uniquely qualified to disrupt this massive $1.5 trillion industry. Not just internally, but our world-class network of investors, advisors and partners that is supporting us in revolutionizing the 100-year old broken car industry.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are senior level guys who have built long careers building huge disruptive things and successfully bringing them to market. And we’re not about to screw up that. We have a habit of working on world-changing things, disrupting the status quo and we’re doing this on a big scale.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">And there is a massive appetite out there for this service. From hundreds of conversations we’ve had over the last year with folks around the country, our model resonates with everyone. People are dying to have a service like this. It just plain makes sense for us to get smarter about how we consume cars.</span></p>

<h3>Beyond Money - We Need Your Help Spreading The Word</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;font-weight: normal;"">At it’s heart, YOYO is a grassroots movement to forever change the car industry. In as little as 10 years from now, we’ll all look back and shake our heads at just how inefficient the car industry and our consumption of cars really is. Paying through the nose for a depreciating hunk of metal in our driveways will seem barbaric compared to the future we envision. We hope to make YOYO the smartest way to access cars. We are working hard to bring the future to today. We've come a long way, but now we need your help. Whether you donate to our campaign or not, you can still help make history. Please spread the word. We’ll not only thank you for it, we’ll reward you handsomely for it, with ongoing monthly checks.</span></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;font-weight: normal;"">If you do decide to support our cause financially, your support will allow us to finish building all the pieces of the service so we can make YOYO available to you and the millions of people who are frustrated with never-ending bills, don’t have reliable access to good cars, are locked into expensive contracts and have been getting screwed by mechanics for a long time. Let's change how we “do” cars in this country. Let’s make cars a utility that we turn on and turn off whenever we want, let’s stop the insanity of paying for things we don’t use or need, let’s stop getting taken advantage of, let’s get our freedom back – together.</span></h3>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>4. How does the 30-day trial work?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Join YOYO and try it out for 30 days. If it's not for you, we'll refund your membership fee. We just know you are going to love YOYO so we are willing to give you a guarantee. Here are the rules:</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>5. Do you offer corporate YOYO memberships?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Yes, YOYO for Corporate is a great money- and time-saving alternative to taxis, car services, rental cars, employee reimbursement and company fleets. YOYO provides you with concierge-service access to a diverse fleet of cars 24/7.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>6. Can I join if I have a driver's license from outside the US or Canada?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">We accept drivers from every country.  You will simply need to complete a form attesting to your driving history and submit it to us with some additional documentation.  Please contact us for details.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>7. Is YOYO in my area?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">We're launching in the San Francisco Bay Area to start with. After a couple of months of testing and tweaking our service to make sure you'll be absolutely ecstatic with it, we'll roll it out everywhere.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Here's the deal - as soon as we have 1,000 early membership signups in a city, we will launch our service there! You literally have a say in how soon YOYO comes to your location.<br/></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>8. How do I receive my first vehicle?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Once your application is accepted, your YOYO concierge will work with you to deliver your first vehicle. We recommend you set aside at least 30 minutes for your first delivery so we can answer any questions and show you the ropes. We will have you behind the wheel within a couple of days.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>9. Will you run a credit check after I apply?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">We trust you. No, we're not planning on running credit checks.  Unfortunately, our insurance providers make us do pesky things like verify your identity and pull driving history.<br/></span></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Ordering Your Car </span></h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>1. How do I reserve a YOYO?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">When you want a car, tell us which one right on your mobile app and where you want it delivered, and a YOYO Agent will drive it to you. When you’re done with it, just press a button in the app and we’ll come pick it up.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>2. For how long can I book a YOYO?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">We've eliminated the concept of time when it comes to getting your car from YOYO. You pay by the mile, not by the day or hour.  We want YOYO to be a replacement for your own car, which you can swap out for any other car you want whenever you want.  In effect, you can keep a YOYO for as little as one day, or as much as 6 months at a time.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>3. Can I book a one-way trip with YOYO?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Since YOYO is a concierge service we’ll pick up the car when you’re ready to return it - wherever you may be located at the time.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>4. How much mileage is included?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Our pricing works on a per-mile basis. There's really no other ongoing, daily, weekly or monthly fee, so there's nothing to include. You only pay for the miles you drive.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>5. What types of vehicles can I drive?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">YOYO offers a variety of vehicles including luxury sedans, hybrids and plug-ins, SUVs, trucks, off-road vehicles, performance cars and even vintage vehicles.<br/></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">A few vehicle highlights:<br/></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>6. What is YOYO's recall policy?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Periodically, automobile manufacturers provide notices of issues relating to their vehicles. These notices range from minor issues to serious problems that may pose a risk to the safety of the driver, passengers and the general public.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">In the United States, when YOYO receives a safety recall notice from a vehicle manufacturer under the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, YOYO identifies the affected vehicles in our fleet and removes them from our reservations system, which prevents them from being reserved. These vehicles cannot be used by our members until we are able to implement a remedy that has been approved by the manufacturer and the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA). Members with future reservations on recalled vehicles will be moved to another car while the issue is addressed</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>7. How much advance notice is required for a swap?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">A 24-hr advance notice is required for a swap. But we'll try to get it to you as quickly as we can, most of the time much faster than 24 hours.</span></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Driving Your Car</span></h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>1. How do I unlock a YOYO?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Unlike Zipcar, you don’t have to walk anywhere in search of a YOYO car. We bring the car and keys to you.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>2. Can I take the car early?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">If the vehicle is available and we can work out the logistics, we’ll bring the car earlier to you.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>3. What if the car is damaged?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Before you drive off, be sure to take a few minutes to do a thorough walk-around with your YOYO agent to see if there are any dents, scratches or other damage. The YOYO agent will create a photo record of any problem areas, which will be accessible in your mobile app.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">You don't want to be held responsible for damage you didn't cause, so please don't forget to check at the start of every reservation.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>4. What if the car is dirty or low on fuel?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Your YOYO car should be clean and have a full tank of fuel when you arrive. </span><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">If there's a problem, we ask that you let your YOYO agent know.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>5. Can I extend my reservation?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">There's nothing to extend :)  We've eliminated the concept of time when it comes to getting your car from YOYO. You pay by the mile, not by the day or hour.  We want YOYO to be a replacement for your own car, which you can swap out for any other car you want whenever you want.  In effect, you can keep a YOYO for as little as one day, or as much as 6 months at a time.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>6. What about tolls?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">For your convenience, we will provide toll passes to YOYO in many cities. There's no surcharge for using the passes — we'll just bill your account for the actual toll amount. Please note that it can take up to 3 weeks for toll charges to come in, so you will be billed separately from your reservation.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>7. Do you have roadside assistance?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Yes, your YOYO membership includes roadside assistance 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Just call us or request roadside assistance on your mobile app and we will take care of the details.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>8. Can I take my pet in a YOYO car?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Yes, but only when it's kept in a locked pet carrier. Many members are allergic to pet hair so if any happen to escape the pet carrier, please clean it up before your reservation comes to an end.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Service animals used by disabled members or passengers with disabilities are an exception. These animals are allowed in the car without a pet carrier. If you need to bring a service animal into a YOYO car, please let us know in advance.</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>9. Can I smoke in a YOYO car?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">No, smoking damages the cars and can impact the health of other members. For any member found to be smoking in the car, we will charge you for the cost of cleaning the car to make it completely smoke free (minimum $250).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Oh, and holding a cigarette outside the car while driving is STILL considered smoking in the car. Just so you know.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>10. Can someone else drive during my reservation?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Only members can drive YOYO cars. If you've got a fellow member along for the ride, it's ok to go ahead and share the driving time. You can also add family or friends to your account so they can drive too.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Non-members are not covered by our insurance. If you allow a non-member to drive during your reservation, it's a serious violation of your member agreement. Not only will you lose your membership, you will also be 100% responsible for repairs if damage occurs to the YOYO car while a non-member is driving. Also, you take on any other liability (e.g. injuries to other people or property) since the reservation is under your name. And that's a bad thing.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>11. What if I've left (or found) something in my YOYO?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">If you've left something in your YOYO car, call the customer service folks, who will try their best to get your item(s) back. Please remember that YOYO car is not responsible for lost items</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">If you find an item belonging to another member, please place it in the glove compartment or trunk, and call us to let us know.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>12. Can I park in commercial zone during my reservation?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">No! Please avoid commercial zone parking areas, or you'll be a sweet target for a parking ticket.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>13. Can I drive my YOYO outside of the US?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">You cannot drive your YOYO into Mexico. Our insurance policy does not cover driving in Mexico. Violation of this policy will result in termination of your YOYO membership, and significant fines and legal action. (We definitely don't want that, so please keep your car north of the border!).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">You can drive your YOYO from the US into Canada, no problem.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>14. What if I get a ticket during my reservation?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">We'll cover gas and insurance, but you are responsible for legal infractions. If we receive a notice and process a violation, you will be charged a $30 processing fee in addition to the original cost of the ticket.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">The best thing to do? Report it.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Call or email us right away and let us know that you received a ticket. Whether you've paid it, or decided to appeal it, we want a record of what's happening. We want to know the date and time the violation was issued, the license plate of the vehicle, the type of violation (speeding, parking, etc), the ticket #, how much it is for and which city gave it to you.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">This way if something goes wrong in the payment process, or you encounter glitches, we'll know you've got it covered and we won't just assume you tossed it in the gutter. Note that certain violations may impact insurance coverage, so it's very important to report any violation to YOYO.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">What if I don't pay it? If you do not pay a ticket, we will be notified and charge you a $30 processing fee. Additionally, you are responsible for the cost of the ticket. If we can, we will redirect the violation to you. If we can't redirect it, we will pay the fine, along with any late fees and bill the total to your account. Other fines or membership suspension can also result, so please pay the ticket when you get it.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Can I dispute it? If you wish to contest a violation and the issuing municipality allows it, be sure to do so promptly! If we receive a notice in the mail, and you have yet to dispute the ticket with the issuing municipality, we will automatically bill your account for the amount of the violation, plus the processing fee.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>15. What if I'm in an accident with my YOYO?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">First, make sure that everyone is safe, get your vehicle to a safe place, exchange information with the other parties and notify the police. Once the situation is stabilized, call us. We will bring you a fresh vehicle and handle everything with respect to the vehicle involved in the incident. The HELP! button in your app home screen has a list of what to report during an accident and other helpful information.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>16. How well-equipped are YOYO cars?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">The majority of vehicles are equipped with a mid to high-end trim package. Most of our vehicles have leather seats. Other options vary by make/model and specific vehicle. We cannot guarantee the availability of certain options.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>17. What happens if my vehicles needs repair?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Our goal is that you will never have to worry about maintenance or repair issues. If something unforeseen occurs, use the YOYO app to notify us. We'll bring you a fresh car so you can get back on the road right away, and we'll take the other one away to get the appropriate repairs done.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>18. Is there a mileage limit per month?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">There is no mileage limit. Drive on!</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>19. Are members responsible for their YOYO car?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Yes, we expect our members to take care of YOYO vehicles as if they owned them. Please drive responsibly, keep your vehicle clean, and let us know of any minor dings or spills via the YOYO app.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>20. What is the condition of YOYO vehicles?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">YOYO is committed to delivering vehicles that are in excellent condition. To that end, we use technology to ensure that the vehicles are properly maintained and driven responsibly.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>1. Where do I return the YOYO when I am done?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">When you’re done with your YOYO, just press a button in the app and we’ll come pick it up.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>2. How do I end my reservation?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Please remember to take all your belongings, remove any trash, and leave at least 1/4 tank of fuel for the next member.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>3. Do I get credit for returning the car early?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Our service is not time-based. You pay for the miles you drive, and not for the hours or days you have a YOYO car. So, the concept of returning the car early (or late) doesn't really exist when you're a YOYO member. Happy worry-free driving  :)</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>4. What happens if I return the car late?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Nothing. See #3 above.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>5. What happens if I return the car dirty or with low fuel?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">The whole idea behind YOYO is that you don't have to care about things like maintaining, cleaning and worrying about gassing up before returning the car. We ask that you treat our cars with respect, just like you would treat yours. Other than that, just relax...we'll take care of it.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>1. What's the insurance coverage?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Every member in good standing who complies with the membership contract is covered while driving a YOYO. Here are the highlights:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">- Third party auto liability coverage*</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">- Members age 25+ receive liability coverage of 100/300/25 ($100,000 bodily injury per person, $300,000 bodily injury maximum, $25,000 property damage). We provide Personal Injury Protection (PIP), or ""no-fault"" coverage, at the level required by the jurisdiction in which the accident occurs.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">- Members are responsible for a $1,000 damage fee per incident, which can be reduced or eliminated with the purchase of an optional damage fee waiver.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">*Please note that coverage may be provided under a certificate of self-insurance, insurance policy, or both.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>1. What is the YOYO joining fee?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">The regular membership fee is $300/year. By signing up during this limited-time promotion campaign you get a lifetime membership for a one-time payment of $99.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>2. What is the minimum commitment to drive YOYO?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Think of it like a public library where you check out and check in books. YOYO works the same way. For each day you ""check out"" a car, you are expected to drive a minimum of 30 miles.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">So, say you have a YOYO car for 5 days. In that case, your obligation is $150, regardless of which day or days you drive (or don't drive). But the 30 miles don't need to be drive every single day. The miles roll over, as long as they add up to at least 150 for the 5 day period.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">It's actually better than that - we only do this once a month, at the end of your billing period. We compare how many days you had a car ""checked out"" that month and how many miles you drove. If it's above the minimum level for the # of days you had the car, we're good. If there's a shortfall, we just add the missing miles to your bill that month.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">In case this is not clear, please reach out to our customer service team, and we'll be happy to explain further.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>3. When will I be charged for my annual membership fee?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">We will charge the annual membership fee every year on the anniversary of your membership, unless you let us know that you’d like to cancel your YOYO membership.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>4. When is the per-mile usage fee due?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">On your billing date, we will charge your credit card on file for the per-mile usage fee due. We meant it when we said no surprises. You can find your running balance every day on our website and in the YOYO app on your phone.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>5. When will I be charged for reserving a YOYO?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">We automatically charge your credit card at the end of your billing period (not when you order your car) for the amount you owe, based on the number of miles you drove that month.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;""><b>6. How can I cancel my membership?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">If you want to cancel your YOYO membership, just reach out to our awesome customer service folks and they'll take care of you. You can do that via live chat on the site, or over the phone, or via email. Just let us know how we can help, and we will do just that.</span></p>

MEET YOYO - It's the smartest way to drive.

Own a car? Please let us start by extending our empathy -- we too
have experienced the ongoing love-hate relationship challenges that
come with car ownership.
On the one hand, we all bought into the concept that owning a car
would be the ultimate symbol of our freedom and independence. But
then on the other there’s the reality of expensive monthly bills,
insurance premiums, maintenance, regular oil changes, rising gas
costs, and overpriced repair bills.

That’s why we created YOYO: The revolutionary new on-demand
service giving drivers everywhere a better alternative to car
ownership.

YOYO provides on-demand, pay-per-mile access to an entire fleet of
personal vehicles without any of the hassles that come with
traditional car ownership -- empowering car owners to ditch their
cars while keeping their freedom. 


Ditch Your Car. Keep Your Freedom.




Check us out at joinyoyo.com









The Dead End Road Of Traditional Car Ownership 




 




Remember what it was like becoming a car owner for the very first
time? The shopper’s high in hand-selecting the perfect set of
wheels? The sense of accomplishment after finally closing the deal?
The sudden surge of newfound empowerment and freedom you felt
leaping into the driver’s seat, gripping the wheel, and fantasizing
about the endless possibilities of hightailing it wherever you want,
whenever you want?
Then you wake up and experienced the inevitable, emotional gear-
shift not long after the initial honeymoon phase has burned up its
fuel. The expensive monthly bills and insurance premiums, the
maintenance, the regular oil changes and rising gas costs, the
overpriced repair bills – all begin to kill that dream.
Do you know what your car actually costs you every month? Do you
know how much you pay for each mile you drive? When asked
about their monthly car costs, most people only consider their car
payment, which on average is around $482. But that $482 isn’t the
whole cost to own that car — far from it.
We almost always overlook all the other sneaky car-related leaks
from our wallets. We have license fees, registration fees and taxes.
We need to buy insurance, fill the gas tank, go in for regular
maintenance. And our cars lose value from depreciation every day
we own it.
These other costs could well end up doubling our out-of-pocket
expenses. That’s NUTS! Especially given the fact that we drive our
cars, on average, 56 minutes a day - that’s just 4% of the time! 











We’re right there with you.

We realized too that our cars that used to be the ultimate symbol of
freedom and independence are actually really lousy assets to own.
And it turns out we’re not alone.
There are over 100 million households in the US who own 230
million cars. We collectively spend over $1.5 TRILLION (yes, that’s a
T) on our cars. We started YOYO because believe that as much as a
third of this money that we consumers spend is just fat in a
ridiculously inefficient system. To add insult to injury, it's a rigged
system and the inefficiencies are totally artificial.
The reality is that more and more folks like you look at car ownership
as an expensive burden more than anything else. You value your
time over physical assets. That’s exactly why Uber, Lyft, ZipCar, and
other modern transportation alternatives are taking off like
gangbusters.
The times certainly are a-changin’ and the sharing economy is taking
hold fast and furious throughout the United States -- but relying on
these kinds of services on a full-time basis just isn’t doable for most
consumers’ pocketbooks. 


A Better Way To Get Moving

With YOYO, we’ve figured out a way that you can completely liberate
yourself from all of these pain points while still maintaining that
sense of freedom and independence that lies at the heart of the car
ownership philosophy.
Tired of paying an arm and a leg for monthly car payments,
insurance premiums, oil changes, and gas costs? Yeah. So are we.
With YOYO, you’re free from all of these expenses. Everything is
included in a single, per-mile fee -- where you pay only for the miles
you actually drive!
Ready to ditch the car depreciating in your driveway while keeping
all of your freedom?
Hop in, buckle up, and join us for the ride! 





Easy As 1, 2, 3...





YOYO provides you with flexible access to an entire fleet of cars for
less than the cost of owning. Our on-demand white-glove concierge
service delivers the right car for the right occasion right to your door.









All it takes is a 1-click, super-fast sign up from our mobile app using
your social credentials, and we make it easier than ever to begin
reaping the all of the many benefits that YOYO offers.
The pains of paying an arm and a leg for monthly car bills and
astronomical insurance premiums? GONE!
Astronomical insurance premiums and complicated claims
processes for minor fender-benders? HISTORY!
The vulnerability of getting swindled by repair shop mechanics?
NEVER AGAIN! 




What You Get With YOYO


















Here’s what YOYO members stand to gain from our service:





Complete on-demand, flexible access to an entire fleet of cars.
With YoYo, you can take a sedan to the office during the week, trade
it for an SUV for the family camping trip over the weekend, and then
swap it out for a convertible to escort your better half on a swanky
night out on the town. Or for you single parents out there, while that
minivan is perfectly practical for shuttling the kids around, wouldn’t it
be great if you could roll up to your date’s house in something just a
little bit sexier? The options are limitless.
A hassle-free, white-glove concierge service.
We’ll send out a YOYO agent to deliver your selected set of wheels
right to you -- whenever you want, wherever you are. When you’re
finished with it, you can either drop it off at our place or press a
button and one of our agents will pick it up for you -- with an option
to swap out for a different car, if it strikes your fancy.
Savings
YOYO members are completely free from purchasing, financing,
insurance, repair, maintenance, DMV registrations, airport parking --
virtually all of the wallet-gouging expenses common to personal car
ownership. You save hundreds over all other alternatives for the
same car, and it’s completely predictable. You get to free up money
for stuff that really matters to you.
Pay-per-mile driving
Our members only pay for the miles that they actually drive. Want to
enjoy a lazy Sunday indoors to catch up on your Netflix? With YOYO,
you can keep your options open while keeping your wallet closed --
because never again will you have to pay a single penny for an idle
car. With YOYO, the family car is finally a true utility that you can turn
on and off whenever you want. That’s a luxury that peer-to-peer
services and traditional car ownership simply CAN’T offer.
Referral rewards
YOYO makes it possible for our members to drive completely for free
over time. Any time you refer one of your friends or family members
to YOYO, you will receive recurring credits and bonuses to lower your
cost of driving. The more people you refer, the more points you earn.
Peace of mind
By letting go of car ownership you’re actually back in the driver’s
seat. Has sort of a Zen ring to it, doesn’t it? The family car is now a
true utility – you can turn it on or off on demand.

Flexible Pricing Plans. No Surprises.
Choose the car that works for you. Our pricing is flexible and totally
variable so you can get, and pay for, exactly what you need. No
decoder ring required.

Our Story
The concept of YOYO was conceived a year ago when Ro’s (one of
the founders) car broke down. Like most consumers not adept with
the complexities of the modern car engine, he was at the mercy of
the repair shop and facing a very large bill. Ro approached his co-
founder Hari, his long-time colleague and go-to auto guru. Hari
intervened and saved him from being taken for thousands of dollars.
After this experience, it became clear to both of them that the car
ownership model is massively broken because of pervasive and
totally artificial information asymmetry at every node in the value
chain. The two began studying the inefficiencies and gaps that exist
in the automotive industry that always seem to put consumers at a
disadvantage. Their attempt to dissolve all the car-related
headaches for the consumer and disrupt a 100-year old ‘broken’ car
consumption model eventually led to the formation and launch of
YOYO.
What we have found is that despite all the “car disruption” noise out
there, people are still facing the headaches that come with personal
car ownership. We believe this is an acute problem worth solving in a
massive market, and we have the right DNA to do it.

Team 






Advisors











In addition to our core team, we've assembled an incredible group of
engineers, designers, and industry experts who are collaborating
with us to create the best service possible. Our partners include the
top automotive, software development, and marketing firms in the
country, with lots of experience in launching products that redefine

core team! Email us at jobs@joinyoyo.com.

This Is NOT Just A Fundraising Campaign! It’s An Exclusive
‘Pre-Sales’ Event.

You see, we at YOYO are going to blow the doors off anything
you’ve seen before. We’re offering some crazy perks in celebration
of our exciting new announcements.
We have a number of exciting developments in the works that are
laying the groundwork for big things to come in 2017. Here’s a look
at what we’ve accomplished with YOYO so far:
Product
Much of the heavy lifting is already done. Our customer-facing app
is almost ready, and the backend server stuff that will power our
service is next on our to-do list. We’ll be ready to deliver cars to our
members in just a couple of months after this campaign closes.
Building Relationships
Our stable of procurement, insurance, logistics, technology
development, and marketing partners includes the biggest names in
the automotive industry. They are excited to work with us and have a
huge physical and operational footprint in the markets we want to
serve. This will help us scale without the need for expensive
infrastructure. Unlike other asset-heavy car startups, YoYo will only
need a fraction of the capital to reach our goal of serving 1 million
members in the next 5 years.

That’s Awesome—But Why Am I Reading This On
Indiegogo?

Crowdfunding is the perfect way to bring you this unique service,
and Indiegogo is the perfect platform to facilitate pre-sales of YOYO
memberships in celebration of the next chapter in our journey.
We've set a modest goal of $25,000 for this campaign. These are not revenue $'s in the sense that we'll spend towards the development of the service (in fact we're going to escrow most of the funds and make them refundable. Please see below). Our primary objective of this campaign is social proof. In other words, your support enables us to show investors that there’s a market for this service and customers are voting with their wallets. 
We’re offering you membership perks at a special price that is
exclusive to this campaign. Not to mention some really nutso no-
brainer perks that we don’t think we’ll ever repeat anywhere. Check
out our Perks and Stretch Goals sections for those. 




Perks





Stretch Goals


To thank you for helping us reach our goals, we’ve decided to do something really crazy! Instead of just getting free memberships and t-shirts and trips, we’re going to DRAMATICALLY lower your cost of driving permanently. I mean, that’s the whole point here, right? A better (and cheaper) way to drive, right? So we figured we’d go all out for our supporters and do just that. 
For each stretch goal we hit (see image below), we knock 10% of your cost of driving with YOYO. What this means is, the crowd (that’s you folks) collectively works to lower the cost of driving for everyone in the crowd. For example, if you as our tribe help us reach the modest goal of $150,000, as our token of appreciation, everyone who contributes $100 or over during this campaign will pay ONLY HALF as much as anyone else who joins outside of this campaign. I bet you that’s way lower than what you’re paying for your car right now. Don’t miss this chance for saving literally hundreds of dollars every month for as long as you’re a YOYO member. And we don’t intend to repeat this craziness ever again. Please support us and lock in your lifetime driving discounts.





Got Trust Issues?
We know. You've backed a crowd-funded project before and that was the last you heard of it. Plus moving cars around is far more expensive than making widgets. So how do you know backing this project will actually lead to a finished product?
We have a rock solid team that is 100% behind this effort. Given the gray hair and decades of experience each of us brings to the table, we are uniquely qualified to disrupt this massive $1.5 trillion industry. Not just internally, but our world-class network of investors, advisors and partners that is supporting us in revolutionizing the 100-year old broken car industry.
We are senior level guys who have built long careers building huge disruptive things and successfully bringing them to market. And we’re not about to screw up that. We have a habit of working on world-changing things, disrupting the status quo and we’re doing this on a big scale.
And there is a massive appetite out there for this service. From hundreds of conversations we’ve had over the last year with folks around the country, our model resonates with everyone. People are dying to have a service like this. It just plain makes sense for us to get smarter about how we consume cars.


Your Contributions Are Refundable
We know we’re asking you to take a chance with a startup like YOYO. So all contributions of  $100 or more  are completely refundable until such time we begin operations in your geographical market. 

We want you to be part of this revolution!


Beyond Money - We Need Your Help Spreading The Word
At it’s heart, YOYO is a grassroots movement to forever change the car industry. In as little as 10 years from now, we’ll all look back and shake our heads at just how inefficient the car industry and our consumption of cars really is. Paying through the nose for a depreciating hunk of metal in our driveways will seem barbaric compared to the future we envision. We hope to make YOYO the smartest way to access cars. We are working hard to bring the future to today. We've come a long way, but now we need your help. Whether you donate to our campaign or not, you can still help make history. Please spread the word. We’ll not only thank you for it, we’ll reward you handsomely for it, with ongoing monthly checks.
If you do decide to support our cause financially, your support will allow us to finish building all the pieces of the service so we can make YOYO available to you and the millions of people who are frustrated with never-ending bills, don’t have reliable access to good cars, are locked into expensive contracts and have been getting screwed by mechanics for a long time. Let's change how we “do” cars in this country. Let’s make cars a utility that we turn on and turn off whenever we want, let’s stop the insanity of paying for things we don’t use or need, let’s stop getting taken advantage of, let’s get our freedom back – together.


All We Need Now Is YOU

Any Questions?


Despite our gift for comprehensive, informative, entertaining (and
exhaustively lengthy) prose, there’s almost no chance that all of your
questions on this endeavor have been answered. It’s a big
undertaking unlike anything the automotive world has taken on, so
there’s a lot to take in. To help out, we’ve put together some FAQ
(frequently asked questions...just in case “What does FAQ stand
for?” was one of your questions). If you still have question marks
occupying comic-esque thought bubbles over your noggin, chime in
via the Comments section.

2. For how long can I book a YOYO?
We've eliminated the concept of time when it comes to getting your car from YOYO. You pay by the mile, not by the day or hour.  We want YOYO to be a replacement for your own car, which you can swap out for any other car you want whenever you want.  In effect, you can keep a YOYO for as little as one day, or as much as 6 months at a time.
3. Can I book a one-way trip with YOYO?
Since YOYO is a concierge service we’ll pick up the car when you’re ready to return it - wherever you may be located at the time.
4. How much mileage is included?
Our pricing works on a per-mile basis. There's really no other ongoing, daily, weekly or monthly fee, so there's nothing to include. You only pay for the miles you drive.
5. What types of vehicles can I drive?
YOYO offers a variety of vehicles including luxury sedans, hybrids and plug-ins, SUVs, trucks, off-road vehicles, performance cars and even vintage vehicles.
A few vehicle highlights:
""TALL"" pricing plan:Sedans: Toyota Prius, Honda Civic, Ford Focus, Ford Fusion, Hyundai Sonata...SUVs: Dodge Journey, Kia Sorento...Trucks: GMC Canyon...Coupes / Convertibles / Classics: Mini Cooper, Ford Mustang, Mazda MX-5 Miata…
""GRANDE"" pricing plan:Sedans: Audi A3, Acura TLX, BMW X1, Mercedes Benz CLA, Lexus NX...SUVs: Audi Q5, Toyota 4Runner, GMC Acadia, Ford Explorer...Trucks: Ford F150, Chevy Silverado...Coupes / Convertibles / Classics: BMW 2 series, Audi Q3…Minivans: Nissan Quest, Dodge Grand Caravan
""VENTI"" pricing plan:Sedans: Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Lexus GS 350, Mercedes E350...SUVs: Audi Q7, BMW X5, Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon XL, Lexus GX 460, Mercedes M Class, Porsche Macan...Trucks: Ford F150 Raptor, Chevrolet Silverado...Coupes / Convertibles:  Audi S5, BMW 4 series, Chevrolet Corvette, Mercedes SLK AMG, Porsche CaymanMinivans: Chrysler Town & Country, Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna
6. What is YOYO's recall policy?
Periodically, automobile manufacturers provide notices of issues relating to their vehicles. These notices range from minor issues to serious problems that may pose a risk to the safety of the driver, passengers and the general public.
In the United States, when YOYO receives a safety recall notice from a vehicle manufacturer under the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, YOYO identifies the affected vehicles in our fleet and removes them from our reservations system, which prevents them from being reserved. These vehicles cannot be used by our members until we are able to implement a remedy that has been approved by the manufacturer and the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA). Members with future reservations on recalled vehicles will be moved to another car while the issue is addressed
7. How much advance notice is required for a swap?
A 24-hr advance notice is required for a swap. But we'll try to get it to you as quickly as we can, most of the time much faster than 24 hours.

Driving Your Car
1. How do I unlock a YOYO?
Unlike Zipcar, you don’t have to walk anywhere in search of a YOYO car. We bring the car and keys to you.
2. Can I take the car early?
If the vehicle is available and we can work out the logistics, we’ll bring the car earlier to you.
3. What if the car is damaged?
Before you drive off, be sure to take a few minutes to do a thorough walk-around with your YOYO agent to see if there are any dents, scratches or other damage. The YOYO agent will create a photo record of any problem areas, which will be accessible in your mobile app.
You don't want to be held responsible for damage you didn't cause, so please don't forget to check at the start of every reservation.
4. What if the car is dirty or low on fuel?
Your YOYO car should be clean and have a full tank of fuel when you arrive. If there's a problem, we ask that you let your YOYO agent know.
5. Can I extend my reservation?
There's nothing to extend :)  We've eliminated the concept of time when it comes to getting your car from YOYO. You pay by the mile, not by the day or hour.  We want YOYO to be a replacement for your own car, which you can swap out for any other car you want whenever you want.  In effect, you can keep a YOYO for as little as one day, or as much as 6 months at a time.
6. What about tolls?
For your convenience, we will provide toll passes to YOYO in many cities. There's no surcharge for using the passes — we'll just bill your account for the actual toll amount. Please note that it can take up to 3 weeks for toll charges to come in, so you will be billed separately from your reservation.
7. Do you have roadside assistance?
Yes, your YOYO membership includes roadside assistance 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Just call us or request roadside assistance on your mobile app and we will take care of the details.
8. Can I take my pet in a YOYO car?
Yes, but only when it's kept in a locked pet carrier. Many members are allergic to pet hair so if any happen to escape the pet carrier, please clean it up before your reservation comes to an end.
Service animals used by disabled members or passengers with disabilities are an exception. These animals are allowed in the car without a pet carrier. If you need to bring a service animal into a YOYO car, please let us know in advance.
9. Can I smoke in a YOYO car?
No, smoking damages the cars and can impact the health of other members. For any member found to be smoking in the car, we will charge you for the cost of cleaning the car to make it completely smoke free (minimum $250).
Oh, and holding a cigarette outside the car while driving is STILL considered smoking in the car. Just so you know.
10. Can someone else drive during my reservation?
Only members can drive YOYO cars. If you've got a fellow member along for the ride, it's ok to go ahead and share the driving time. You can also add family or friends to your account so they can drive too.
Non-members are not covered by our insurance. If you allow a non-member to drive during your reservation, it's a serious violation of your member agreement. Not only will you lose your membership, you will also be 100% responsible for repairs if damage occurs to the YOYO car while a non-member is driving. Also, you take on any other liability (e.g. injuries to other people or property) since the reservation is under your name. And that's a bad thing.
11. What if I've left (or found) something in my YOYO?
If you've left something in your YOYO car, call the customer service folks, who will try their best to get your item(s) back. Please remember that YOYO car is not responsible for lost items
If you find an item belonging to another member, please place it in the glove compartment or trunk, and call us to let us know.
12. Can I park in commercial zone during my reservation?
No! Please avoid commercial zone parking areas, or you'll be a sweet target for a parking ticket.
13. Can I drive my YOYO outside of the US?
You cannot drive your YOYO into Mexico. Our insurance policy does not cover driving in Mexico. Violation of this policy will result in termination of your YOYO membership, and significant fines and legal action. (We definitely don't want that, so please keep your car north of the border!).
You can drive your YOYO from the US into Canada, no problem.
14. What if I get a ticket during my reservation?
We'll cover gas and insurance, but you are responsible for legal infractions. If we receive a notice and process a violation, you will be charged a $30 processing fee in addition to the original cost of the ticket.
The best thing to do? Report it.
Call or email us right away and let us know that you received a ticket. Whether you've paid it, or decided to appeal it, we want a record of what's happening. We want to know the date and time the violation was issued, the license plate of the vehicle, the type of violation (speeding, parking, etc), the ticket #, how much it is for and which city gave it to you.
This way if something goes wrong in the payment process, or you encounter glitches, we'll know you've got it covered and we won't just assume you tossed it in the gutter. Note that certain violations may impact insurance coverage, so it's very important to report any violation to YOYO.
What if I don't pay it? If you do not pay a ticket, we will be notified and charge you a $30 processing fee. Additionally, you are responsible for the cost of the ticket. If we can, we will redirect the violation to you. If we can't redirect it, we will pay the fine, along with any late fees and bill the total to your account. Other fines or membership suspension can also result, so please pay the ticket when you get it.
Can I dispute it? If you wish to contest a violation and the issuing municipality allows it, be sure to do so promptly! If we receive a notice in the mail, and you have yet to dispute the ticket with the issuing municipality, we will automatically bill your account for the amount of the violation, plus the processing fee.
15. What if I'm in an accident with my YOYO?
First, make sure that everyone is safe, get your vehicle to a safe place, exchange information with the other parties and notify the police. Once the situation is stabilized, call us. We will bring you a fresh vehicle and handle everything with respect to the vehicle involved in the incident. The HELP! button in your app home screen has a list of what to report during an accident and other helpful information.
16. How well-equipped are YOYO cars?
The majority of vehicles are equipped with a mid to high-end trim package. Most of our vehicles have leather seats. Other options vary by make/model and specific vehicle. We cannot guarantee the availability of certain options.
17. What happens if my vehicles needs repair?
Our goal is that you will never have to worry about maintenance or repair issues. If something unforeseen occurs, use the YOYO app to notify us. We'll bring you a fresh car so you can get back on the road right away, and we'll take the other one away to get the appropriate repairs done.
18. Is there a mileage limit per month?
There is no mileage limit. Drive on!
19. Are members responsible for their YOYO car?
Yes, we expect our members to take care of YOYO vehicles as if they owned them. Please drive responsibly, keep your vehicle clean, and let us know of any minor dings or spills via the YOYO app.
20. What is the condition of YOYO vehicles?
YOYO is committed to delivering vehicles that are in excellent condition. To that end, we use technology to ensure that the vehicles are properly maintained and driven responsibly.
Returning Your Car 
1. Where do I return the YOYO when I am done?
When you’re done with your YOYO, just press a button in the app and we’ll come pick it up.
2. How do I end my reservation?
Please remember to take all your belongings, remove any trash, and leave at least 1/4 tank of fuel for the next member.
3. Do I get credit for returning the car early?
Our service is not time-based. You pay for the miles you drive, and not for the hours or days you have a YOYO car. So, the concept of returning the car early (or late) doesn't really exist when you're a YOYO member. Happy worry-free driving  :)
4. What happens if I return the car late?
Nothing. See #3 above.
5. What happens if I return the car dirty or with low fuel?
The whole idea behind YOYO is that you don't have to care about things like maintaining, cleaning and worrying about gassing up before returning the car. We ask that you treat our cars with respect, just like you would treat yours. Other than that, just relax...we'll take care of it.

Insurance
1. What's the insurance coverage?
Every member in good standing who complies with the membership contract is covered while driving a YOYO. Here are the highlights:
- Third party auto liability coverage*
- Members age 25+ receive liability coverage of 100/300/25 ($100,000 bodily injury per person, $300,000 bodily injury maximum, $25,000 property damage). We provide Personal Injury Protection (PIP), or ""no-fault"" coverage, at the level required by the jurisdiction in which the accident occurs.
- Members are responsible for a $1,000 damage fee per incident, which can be reduced or eliminated with the purchase of an optional damage fee waiver.
*Please note that coverage may be provided under a certificate of self-insurance, insurance policy, or both.
Billing & Membership
1. What is the YOYO joining fee?
The regular membership fee is $300/year. By signing up during this limited-time promotion campaign you get a lifetime membership for a one-time payment of $99.
2. What is the minimum commitment to drive YOYO?
Think of it like a public library where you check out and check in books. YOYO works the same way. For each day you ""check out"" a car, you are expected to drive a minimum of 30 miles.
So, say you have a YOYO car for 5 days. In that case, your obligation is $150, regardless of which day or days you drive (or don't drive). But the 30 miles don't need to be drive every single day. The miles roll over, as long as they add up to at least 150 for the 5 day period.
It's actually better than that - we only do this once a month, at the end of your billing period. We compare how many days you had a car ""checked out"" that month and how many miles you drove. If it's above the minimum level for the # of days you had the car, we're good. If there's a shortfall, we just add the missing miles to your bill that month.
In case this is not clear, please reach out to our customer service team, and we'll be happy to explain further.
3. When will I be charged for my annual membership fee?
We will charge the annual membership fee every year on the anniversary of your membership, unless you let us know that you’d like to cancel your YOYO membership.
4. When is the per-mile usage fee due?
On your billing date, we will charge your credit card on file for the per-mile usage fee due. We meant it when we said no surprises. You can find your running balance every day on our website and in the YOYO app on your phone.
5. When will I be charged for reserving a YOYO?
We automatically charge your credit card at the end of your billing period (not when you order your car) for the amount you owe, based on the number of miles you drove that month.

6. How can I cancel my membership?
If you want to cancel your YOYO membership, just reach out to our awesome customer service folks and they'll take care of you. You can do that via live chat on the site, or over the phone, or via email. Just let us know how we can help, and we will do just that.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Why Support The Social Cut? </h3>
<p>We’ve got the place and now it’s the time to build this one-of-a-kind man grooming haven in Downtown Pomona! I thought to myself, ""If the community would pitch in to what we already have, imagine how much more amazing we can make this place for our future customers?""</p>
<p>The funding will help cover the cost for necessary upgrades to the plumbing, electrical, equipment and social area for customers to enjoy coffee (did we mention we're planning FREE WIFI?!).</p>
<p>We want everyone supporting The Social Cut to feel as a part of what we’re doing, to feel at home and to be able to walk into The Social Cut and say, “We helped build this place, this is our place”. So check out our supporter pledge packages, there's a pledge level for everyone.

<h3>Why Downtown Pomona?</h3>
<p>You can find trendy cafes all throughout the LA area, including the Arts District, Silver Lake, Echo Park, etc., but there are few options once you travel east. We're not only looking to fill that void, but we're also bringing men's grooming and tailoring services to the mix. So, we've chosen Downtown Pomona as the official home of The Social Cut. Downtown Pomona is home to the famous Fox Theatre and has an arts village filled with fashion-forward, creative trendsetters as well as a large professional population working at the nearby courthouse, City Hall, and office buildings. It’s been great seeing this city undergo revitalization with new shops, restaurants and festivals in recent years, so our goal is to bring to the thriving and trendy neighborhood of Downtown Pomona what it’s missing: the convenience of a full service barbershop, tailor and cafe. The Social Cut is here to provide the community with the best service, a cool spot to relax at, great tasting coffee and a place to get the best men's grooming from head-to-toe.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>You can't beat the beauty of this 1930's Art Deco building and its beautiful, historic downtown setting. But as they say, you never know what issue you will encounter when you're in construction.

<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong><br/>Seven years ago, Chris May started roasting coffee in a popcorn popper. While the machinery we use to roast our beans has changed, our persistence to produce the perfect tasting cup of coffee hasn’t. After a successful DIY Coffee Supply company revealed an enthusiasm for specialty coffee within the community, we decided it was time to open a proper boutique coffee café in our beloved town. We believe our café should be a common ground, a sort of third space. There can be stress at work and there can be stress at home, but not here. Here is a space where a vibrant community can come together to rest and to laugh and to work. A space specifically cultivated and lovingly crafted to serve and bless our community, just like our coffee. Contributions will help us bring an experience of specialty coffee to our city, as well as realize a vision of creating a space for peace, art, and culture within our community.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong><br/>ESPRESSO<br/>A coffee shop isn’t complete without an espresso machine. We believe that quality requires focus and attention to the smallest details. That’s why when we begin to serve espresso drinks, they will be drinks made to the highest standard of quality.</p>
<p>JUICE BAR<br/>We want to continue bringing fresh juices made from organic fruits and vegetables to our customers. We’d like to begin including things like protein, essential oils, and probiotics in our juices. We’d even like to begin bottling our beverages. For this, we need a juicer with bottling capability and an industrial blender.</p>
<p>ROASTER<br/>Thankfully, our coffee is in high demand. Our current roaster is unable to keep up with our production requirements, so we need a bigger one. This will allow us to produce and sell more bagged coffee beans, eventually online, and have an enticing variety available to our in-store customers.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p>These are our three primary needs. If we make our goal, we’ll be able purchase these needed supplies immediately and completely. If we don’t make our goal, we’ll use the funds to expand our espresso bar, and then invest in the expansion of our juice bar and roasting capabilities respectively.</p> <p><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong><br/>Some of the exciting perks we’ve lined up for this campaign include a Professional Brew Kit, a Custom Leather Bag (designed here in Goshen by Janus Motorcycles), Coffee for Life, Artisan-made Mugs and other apparel.</p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT WE’LL MAKE</strong><br/>We love coffee and we love people, and after experiencing the enthusiasm of our community during our successful DIY Coffee Supply venture, we are passionate about maintaining a place of culture and coffee for our city. Goshen is an amazing town full of art, life, and incredible people. We want to bring all of that together into one space. Over a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>THE CHALLENGES WE FACE</strong><br/>Our venture is unique for a town of this size, both in the degree of craftsmanship and communal focus we are attempting. We then have the task of not just supporting the coffee enthusiasts in our neighborhood, but also familiarizing a portion of the population with an experience of coffee that may be new and foreign to them, all while maintaining a clear view of our desire to deliver the highest standard of quality and the utmost degree of hospitality to our community.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong><br/>Come by the shop. Experience the coffee and enjoy the community. And tell people about it. Leave a review on Yelp. Follow us on Instagram. Better yet, invite your friends to the shop. Also, feel free to share this campaign with anyone you think might like to get involved.</p>

<h3>Welcome to Bookish: An Indie Shop for Folks Who Read!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are a pair high school English teachers who have spent the 15 and 14 years of our careers putting good books into kids' hands, preaching the value of independent reading and choice to our peers and administrators, and dreaming about the day that we would move beyond our classrooms to share our love of literature with a broader audience. This May we will say goodbye to that part of our lives and step into the next part of our professional adventure as independent bookstore owners! </p>
<p>We want to promote literacy all over the River Valley. But we can’t wait until the summer to start this process!  There is so much to do to get ready for our brick and mortar opening next fall!  Between the two of us, we have enough funds to cover ⅔ of our anticipated start-up budget and those funds are tied up until next July. We want to begin building a relationship with the community that is going to support our store, so we have decided to use crowdfunding as a means to raise the other ⅓ of our start-up costs. </p>
<p><i><strong>Bookish:</strong></i> will be, first and foremost,  a bookstore.  We will carry a well-curated selection of new books and some amazing sideline items that readers will love.  Our expertise will make our bookstore different from the big box booksellers.  We are readers and have spent our careers connecting people to books they might like to read.  Building those relationships isn’t something a big box store has the time or expertise to do.  </p>
<p>We also want to be a hub for the community.  My (Jen's) sweet mother, who was also an educator for 42 years, will be our children’s area expert.  Research tells us that children who live in print-rich environments and who are read to daily will meet reading milestones on time and even exceed them. In addition to hosting story times at the store, we want to partner with schools, preschools, and homeschoolers to have weekly events for children and young adults. Mom has already begun planning the fun!</p>
<p>We hope it’s obvious to you that we are excited! We want you to be excited, too! We’ve spent a lot of time designing the perfect perks to offer our backers. We also realize that some of you who are looking at our campaign because you know us personally may not be familiar with crowdfunding, so feel free to reach out to us with any questions. In a nutshell, we opted to utilize IndieGogo because every dollar we raise from our community of backers is one less dollar that we potentially have to borrow from a bank. We want <i><strong>Bookish:</strong></i> to be in the best possible position to succeed, and we know your support will make that happen.</p>
<h3>The Details!</h3>

<ul><li>We need to raise an additional $30,000 to complete our start-up budget. We have designed a selection of perks to fit all budgets from a simple ""Good Luck"" contribution to a variety of <i><strong>Bookish:</strong></i> merchandise to actually reserving our space your own private event among the stacks! </li></ul>
<p> </p>

<h3>But aren't independent bookstores closing?</h3>
<p>The short answer -- not any more! Since the 1990s more than 2/3 of the independent bookstore in the U.S. have closed, but thanks to the shop local movement and the committed work of the American Booksellers Association, small independent stores are opening again in areas that are missing this cultural staple in their community. Consumers are finding that there is no replacement for the personal relationships that are forged with real, live booksellers. </p>

My early interests in barbering were nurtured on the west side of Chicago, where I was born and raised in the North Lawndale community. Due to my reputation amongst peers as an artist, I was asked to create  graphic designs in haircuts. Those haircuts would be the beginning of work as a community barber. Though there was a natural ability, I didn't seriously pursue the profession until many years later. I currently service a wide ranging clientele representing many different textures and personal and professional tastes.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508569170/n4kdtcluybcscdxzbbxz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>I am a professionally trained barber who uses traditional barbering techniques to create an extensive range of styles for a diverse clientele.

I am married with three sons and reside on the west side of Chicago. I currently work at Sohohouse Chicago as a barber and have had the pleasure of working in some of the best barbershops in Chicago. I have been cutting hair since I was 15 and have now been cutting hair professionally for the past six years. My early interests in barbering were nurtured on the west side of Chicago, where I was born and raised in the North Lawndale community. Due to my reputation amongst peers as an artist, I was asked to create  graphic designs in haircuts. Those haircuts would be the beginning of work as a community barber. Though there was a natural ability, I didn't seriously pursue the profession until many years later. I currently service a wide ranging clientele representing many different textures and personal and professional tastes.  I am a professionally trained barber who uses traditional barbering techniques to create an extensive range of styles for a diverse clientele. I am also a visual artist whose work in artistic expression influences my creativity in creating styles. Over time, I started to appreciate the profession of barbering and created a vision that has empowered me to do what I love today. I’ve been featured for barbering in magazines such as Chicago Social, Men’s book, Haberdash Clothing blog and Sohohouse’s House Four magazine.My Areas of Expertise arehot towel straight razor shavesshear/scissor stylinggrooming consultationstyle consultation    My Education & Training consist ofProfessional barber's training from Success Barber School (Chicago, IL), state licensed 20121000 medical floor hoursTrained as barber stylist, experienced in clippers, shears, and straight razorsCompleted in the top 5% of cohort  I have been blessed with the opportunity to open the barbershop of my dreams with the help of some angel investors that will allow me to raise a portion of my needs to fully open the barber shop. This campaign will help me raise a small portion of the large amount to open. It is so important that I raise the funds to hecreate the vision I have for Principle Barbers and the Principle brand.Principle Barbershop will be a place for straight razorshaves, haircuts for men, women and children, a place for shop talks and creative events, lovers of art and music, performances with live bands, DJs and a platform and meeting place for the community. It is important to me to offer other barbers the opportunity to join me in being an influence and mentor. It will be a shop that is built on principles of professionalism, proper quality service, client relationships, freedom and creativity.  By helping me and contributing to my fund, you will allow me to create a pivot in my life, myfamily, community, clients and friends. You will be helping me build a dream, a barbershop and brand that has the potential to change the barbering industry as a whole. Principle Barbers will provide professional and proper men's grooming services in a healthy, creative atmosphere.

<h3>The Story So Far</h3>
<p>Lucky Goblin Games is a real place today. The lease is signed, the building is being renovated as we speak, and product is on the way. We are excitedly planning our grand opening.</p>
<p>This brand new store is the passion project of Charlotte and Seamus, and the culmination of a dream we've fostered since long before we even met. (On a gaming forum, of course.) We are a husband and wife team of geeks who have been stomping around the Friendly Local Gaming Scene for combined decades. And we've noticed something.</p>
<p>The wife part of the team was not always made to feel comfortable.</p>
<p>In fact, now that we're paying attention, a lot of people aren't feeling entirely comfortable. While the pull of the sheer joy and magic of hobby gaming is as strong as ever, a lot of people feel that the scene is not for them. This makes us mad.</p>
<p>Lucky Goblin Games was founded for them. For us. For everyone.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Next Few Weeks</h3>
<p>We are raising funds to make the space we have accessible and (arguably more importantly) <i>comfortable</i> for everyone. While this is mostly done through consistently cultivating a culture of friendliness and inclusiveness, extra funds will allow us the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>we will hire an accessibility expert to advise us on ways to make sure we aren't just legally ACA-compliant, but rather <i>truly</i> accessible and aware</li>
<li>we will create a ""quiet space"" in the store where those of us who do not deal well with crowds can decompress, recollect and regroup between intense games or on busier evenings</li>
<li>while we are fully set to have aids and products for disabled gamers available free of charge (colored stickers, braille dice, etc) extra funds would help us keep a larger selection of these wonderful products on hand. This would include a 3D printer to help us create gaming aids on demand.</li>
<li>gaming spaces in the past have been unkind to gamers of heavier body types. Wobbly card tables and plastic folding chairs do not pair well with any derriere, let alone the heftier one. Our insistence on having sturdy, wide and comfortable chairs and tables with lots of elbow room (not to mention pathways for people using mobility devices) is the reason we have leased a space that is a lot roomier than most stores. Your contribution would help alleviate the cost of this extra space in these delicate start-up months.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Fostering a friendly culture costs nothing but a few moments of conviction. Not a cent is required for us to learn about the hurdles some gamers face and open our doors to everyone who wants to share in the joy of gaming.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us with the parts that aren't free: an environment that is extra comfortable and cozy as well as functional, more space for specialty product, more funds to reach a wider audience and keep our mission of gaming inclusiveness going.</p>
<p>Lucky Goblin Games, LLC does not have debt with any lending institutions and we desperately want to keep it that way. So far this adventure has been made possible by personal funds from ourselves and private investors who have faith in our mission and plans and are providing ongoing professional support.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Lucky Goblin Games is already a reality. We have leased a pricier space on a main street for the sole purpose of backing up our mission of accessibility. While our private investors have great faith in our business plan and have contributed generously, our store is vulnerable to the same type of risk any physical store is subject to. Rent and utilities need to be paid, storms may temporarily close our doors, rent prices may change. We have done all we can to fully guard ourselves from these problems.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We would like to thank you so much for considering our campaign and wanting to be part of our mission. Every dollar helps, but so does every tweet, like and share! </p>
<p>Happy gaming,</p>

We love the parks, the local summer concerts, farmers markets, being a short distance from ATL, and most of all, the people.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554378490/ady7i2jmknll0zvj4odg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our journey has led us to the desire to build community where we live. And what better way for community to gather than over awesome coffee and food in a relaxing space? That is what we want to create for you.</p>
<p><strong>Life Stream Coffee House </strong>- why this name? Pretty simple, coffee is the stream that gives life. Also we plan to have a worship time together on Sundays where we talk about the One who streams eternal life into us daily.</p>
<p>Our location at 1180 Old Tucker Road is a residential home zoned commercial with a huge wrap-around deck and a beautiful backyard with a lovely accessible nature walk through a serene wooded area where birds sing and squirrels frolick.  With seating available indoors, on the deck, and scattered throughout the yard in patio areas, we will be able to accommodate all sizes and types of groups.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we need help funding? </strong></p>
<p>We have chosen a location, but as new business owners, loans are unfortunately difficult to obtain. Banks are a bummer sometimes. Soooo, that's where you come in!</p>
<p>Giving to this campaign is basically a coffee pre-order. Whatever you give up front, we will return to you in coffee and food and swag! It's a win-win! <strong>PLUS </strong>you'll get invited to pre-opening VIP events like coffee tastings <strong>PLUS</strong> you may get the chance to name a menu item!</p>
<p>We truly want Life Stream to be your favorite hang out, the place you come to ""get away,"" where you can enjoy the company of friends and family, meet a client, find a casual co-working space, or just enjoy an evening out.</p>
<p>We will be open early to late, so we can get you that jolt you need in the morning, offering curbside service so you don't even have to step out of your vehicle! And we will be that spot in the evenings for fun family-friendly events.</p>
<p>And <strong>you </strong>can have a part in making this happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So let's break this down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like I said, being first time business owners, we can't get traditional bank funding. We are investing some of our own savings, but we need an additional $75,000 to fund the startup costs. </li>
<li>These costs include the kitchen renovation, some electrical and plumbing work, kitchen equipment purchases, outdoor signage, inventory, and furniture. </li>
<li>
<strong>Perks: </strong>now the good stuff - this will be fleshed out more in the next section, but perks for giving will include coffee drinks, food, t-shirts, travel mugs, hats, invitations to VIP events, special recognition, and the chance to name your own menu item (maybe even a piece of equipment, can you imagine everyone calling the espresso machine by YOUR name!?)</li>
<li>The way Indiegogo is set up is we can still get the funds even if we don't reach the goal, we just pay an extra percentage. So if the goal is not reached, that's what we will do, but we KNOW we can reach this goal!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In addition to the coffee house being a gathering place during the week, Chris will also host a worship gathering on Sundays. Everyone is welcome! If the weather permits, you will probably find us worshiping outside on the deck or patio area.</p>
<p>We also plan to employ single moms and people with special needs and offer space for not-for-profit groups to gather at no charge.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our greatest challenges will be with the construction process and the county legalities. We plan to overcome these hurdles through a careful selection process of our contractors and working with the county to pass the required inspections.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand some people are unable to contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Please help us get the word out and make some noise about this campaign using the Indiegogo share tools, sharing through your social media pages, e-mail, and just by telling everyone you know in person!</li>
<li>If you are handy with tools, painting, lawn equipment, design, and gardening, we would treasure your help on some work days! Really the whole reason we want to open a coffee house is to meet all of you and get to know you all better. We need you as much as we need coffee!</li>

<h3>So, What Exactly Is Cali Green Life?</h3>
<p>Cali Green Life is essentially a movement toward sustainability and eco-friendly living, fueled as a contracting business. We are a small, but mighty, team of dedicated people who believe in living with purpose, at work and at home.</p>
<p><strong>Our vision is a world where every person's first instinct is to choose sustainability, and a market where that instinct is affordable to all.</strong></p>
<p>That can be achieved through education, through inspiration, through partnership, through hard work and dedication, and by making eco-friendly contracting options available for people to start going green where they spend most of their time: at home, and in the office.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of Cali Green Life</h3>
<p>Cali Green Life opened its doors as Cali Green Turf in August of 2015 with one simple mission: Help Californians make it through one of the most severe droughts in modern history, while allowing them to maintain the allure and beauty of a lush, green yard.</p>
<p>The So Cal sun drives our outdoor lifestyle, and people like to have fun! So we wanted people to stop using water to keep grass alive (and stop releasing harmful fumes into the air from lawn mowers and leaf blowers), but we wanted them to still enjoy their lawns. </p>
<p>Artificial turf was a great way to do that. It looks pretty. It's fun—and safe—for kids and pets. It's low maintenance. And it gives people the same outdoor playtime opportunities as grass did. In fact, in some cases, there are even more chances to play. Nothing like a year-round putting green right at home!</p>
<p>Rather than measuring success through profitability—which is absolutely important for a business to last!—we opted to measure success through gallons of water saved. By switching to American-made, lead-free, high-quality artificial turf, people could </p>
<p>In 2016, the first full year in business, Cali Green Turf saved nearly 8 million gallons of water, diverted from watering lawns. That's something we're really proud of. In 2017, the goal is another 10 million gallons.</p>
<p>In mid-2016, Cali Green Paint was added to the Cali Green Life family, offering VOC-free indoor painting services and energy-saving COOLWALL exterior coatings.</p>
<p>Through partnerships with highly qualified and trusted experts, Cali Green Life also offers solar panels, installed </p>
<h3>Smart Employees: Minority + Veteran Owned and Operated</h3>
<p>Cali Green Life is made up of motivated, driven, bright individuals, from diverse backgrounds—women and men of different ethnicities. A real hodgepodge of Southern California goodness.</p>
<p>The founder, Edi Santos, is a U.S. Marine Corps Combat Veteran who grew up in poverty, born to a 16-year-old single mother, and worked his way up to purposeful entrepreneurship through education (ultimately earning an MBA) and the military. He left a successful career in banking to start the business. He wants to help people save money, build community and save the planet at the same time.</p>
<p>His brother, George Cisneros, is an Army Veteran. George is the Director of Sales, making it a family business. Clients love his excellent customer service, his can-do attitude, and his design aesthetic.</p>
<p>Every person who works for the company, from office staff to installer, has that same commitment to service and environmental responsibility.</p>
<h3>That Sweet Sense of Contributing to Community</h3>
</div><div>
<p>What you see on the right is what you get, materially speaking. We've set up some awesome perks that we think you'll be excited about!</p>
<p>But we hope you're even more interested in what you'll get as one of the early supporters of Cali Green Life—that feeling of having supported a start-up business creating job opportunity, one with purpose and a sense of service and a commitment to honesty and integrity.</p>
<p>What we sincerely hope you'll receive the moment you choose your contribution level and perk is a feeling of complete satisfaction, knowing that your money will be used to make the world a better place to live.</p>
<h3>What Will My Money Do?</h3>
<p>In a nutshell: Give Cali Green Life the longevity and flexibility to make a deeper impact.</p>

Cali Green Life is essentially a movement toward sustainability and eco-friendly living, fueled as a contracting business. We are a small, but mighty, team of dedicated people who believe in living with purpose, at work and at home.
Our vision is a world where every person's first instinct is to choose sustainability, and a market where that instinct is affordable to all.
That can be achieved through education, through inspiration, through partnership, through hard work and dedication, and by making eco-friendly contracting options available for people to start going green where they spend most of their time: at home, and in the office.
A Brief History of Cali Green Life
Cali Green Life opened its doors as Cali Green Turf in August of 2015 with one simple mission: Help Californians make it through one of the most severe droughts in modern history, while allowing them to maintain the allure and beauty of a lush, green yard.
The So Cal sun drives our outdoor lifestyle, and people like to have fun! So we wanted people to stop using water to keep grass alive (and stop releasing harmful fumes into the air from lawn mowers and leaf blowers), but we wanted them to still enjoy their lawns. 
Artificial turf was a great way to do that. It looks pretty. It's fun—and safe—for kids and pets. It's low maintenance. And it gives people the same outdoor playtime opportunities as grass did. In fact, in some cases, there are even more chances to play. Nothing like a year-round putting green right at home!
Rather than measuring success through profitability—which is absolutely important for a business to last!—we opted to measure success through gallons of water saved. By switching to American-made, lead-free, high-quality artificial turf, people could 
In 2016, the first full year in business, Cali Green Turf saved nearly 8 million gallons of water, diverted from watering lawns. That's something we're really proud of. In 2017, the goal is another 10 million gallons.
In mid-2016, Cali Green Paint was added to the Cali Green Life family, offering VOC-free indoor painting services and energy-saving COOLWALL exterior coatings.
Through partnerships with highly qualified and trusted experts, Cali Green Life also offers solar panels, installed 
Smart Employees: Minority + Veteran Owned and Operated
Cali Green Life is made up of motivated, driven, bright individuals, from diverse backgrounds—women and men of different ethnicities. A real hodgepodge of Southern California goodness.
The founder, Edi Santos, is a U.S. Marine Corps Combat Veteran who grew up in poverty, born to a 16-year-old single mother, and worked his way up to purposeful entrepreneurship through education (ultimately earning an MBA) and the military. He left a successful career in banking to start the business. He wants to help people save money, build community and save the planet at the same time.
His brother, George Cisneros, is an Army Veteran. George is the Director of Sales, making it a family business. Clients love his excellent customer service, his can-do attitude, and his design aesthetic.
Every person who works for the company, from office staff to installer, has that same commitment to service and environmental responsibility.
That Sweet Sense of Contributing to Community

What you see on the right is what you get, materially speaking. We've set up some awesome perks that we think you'll be excited about!
But we hope you're even more interested in what you'll get as one of the early supporters of Cali Green Life—that feeling of having supported a start-up business creating job opportunity, one with purpose and a sense of service and a commitment to honesty and integrity.
What we sincerely hope you'll receive the moment you choose your contribution level and perk is a feeling of complete satisfaction, knowing that your money will be used to make the world a better place to live.
What Will My Money Do?
In a nutshell: Give Cali Green Life the longevity and flexibility to make a deeper impact.
Cali Green Life is operational. Our sales are keeping the doors open the jobs churning. The doors are open; our employees are paid; the lights are on. But, because we're such a new company, we are living the life of a start-up each and every day. That means money goes directly into the next gig, and costs are kept as tight as can be.
What we'd really love is to be able to grow, so that we can reach more people and expand the movement and messaging. We want to tell our employees to spend time on messaging, on relationship building, on digging into sustainable news and research, on creating events that bring the community together, on educating our children and our neighbors about how to lead a greener life. Those are priorities that we'd like to foster and give attention to, just as we put an emphasis on sales.
We're already doing some of that. Already this year, we've:

donated excess turf to Trash for Teaching, a nonprofit organization that supports STEAM education in the local schools,
scheduled a beach cleanup,
signed a letter in support of the Paris Climate Agreement,
started talks with the local school district to give back a percentage of local sales, 
committed funds to Giveback Homes, a nonprofit organization building homes for those in need here and abroad. 

We are committed to doing our part to make the earth a better place to live, for generations to come, starting with our little corner of it.
But in order to grow, we need to raise a little bit of a cushion to make those types of things happen.
Your support will mean that we can give our employees the latitude to express environmental leadership and delve into education, without worrying about a time crunch or how it will impact sales.
What Else?
In addition to expanded messaging and service, money from this growth campaign will allow us to:

invest in new equipment,
join local organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce,
increase advertising efforts in print and digital marketing,
ride out the slow times when rain prevents our painters from climbing ladders and our installers from nailing in turf,
take on an intern interested in learning the ropes of green business,
attend conferences and trade shows,
invest in employee education.

We have an awesome team. Help us keep them busy!

<p>As mobile DJ's in Southern California, we have hosted or helped organize numerous charity events over the years, raising thousands of dollars for those in need. From homeless shelters and food banks to recovery and addiction groups, we have been an integral part of almost 30 charity events. Inspired by the ""Axis of Justice"" tour, that brought together musicians, fans, and grassroots activism to fight for social justice together. <strong> We are looking to take this work to the next level, and do it on a daily basis from the coolest boutique/co.op/workshop ever! #shopchillcreate</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the proposed boutique, along with the Revolution Groove clothing line, is to create revenue and create a social impact. Creating locally owned businesses makes the way for <strong>the</strong> <strong>people</strong> to control the economy and the push toward living wages for all. Revolution Groove plans to use a portion of the profit to support local and global community efforts toward self-sustainablilty and for giving to charities, meanwhile becoming a place that will cultivate the arts and education.<strong> #respectart</strong></p>
<p>As we hear daily how programs for the poor and under privileged are being cut or completely eliminated, <strong>now is the time to stand up for those in need</strong>. We are looking for a lot of help from what we like to call ""<strong>co-conspirators</strong> in the evil plot to make the world a better place.""</p>
<p><strong>Your contributions</strong> will go to help us secure the first of many permanent locations. This space will be an open venue for musicians to play, teachers to teach, artists to create, and the community to organize. From these locations we will create unique shopping experiences that involve art, music, decor, accessories, hand crafted artisan wares from around the world and around the corner. Worldly and eclectic ...this space will ""propagate RAD"". <strong>All things in the store will support someone, somewhere, fairly. </strong>The largest collective on the planet is an amazing goal to have! <strong>#propagaterad</strong></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Supporting those ""around the world and around the corner"" is our philosophy</strong>. Generous contributions made by our co-conspirators will support a wide variety of projects and people, through our online and in-store sales and activities. Every purchase will be supporting someone, somewhere, fairly! From Ugandan and Darfur genocide survivors, displaced Syrian artisans, and local homeless shelter populations, to local artists and environmental organizations.  Our daily work will be about supporting those in need, as well as those trying to change the world. Organizations like the ACLU, Southern Poverty Law Center, Sea Shepard, FreeSET, and International Worldwide Workers are examples of who we will seek to support.  We will also cultivate a 'give where you live' mantra. <strong>This project is ALL about the outcome, by creating income and supporting those in need!</strong></p>

<p><strong>An example of the impact of your contribution</strong> is illustrated in a personal story of our support of YouthHope. As mobile DJs in Redlands, California we were able to connect with an amazing group of individuals who helped homeless teens find the help they needed. This means the most basic of needs; food, suicide counseling, clothing, transportation, skill building, schooling, and literally <strong>anything else</strong> the kids may need. </p>
<p><strong>Our story </strong>starts with an afternoon helping repair bicycles that had been donated but were still inoperable. As we spent the day trying to collect working parts off the donated bicycles, to repair anything we could, we were only able to get one up and running. We were hoping to have had more complete bicycles but one was all that could be done. The goal of these bicycles were to provide transportation for the kids so they could get to school and work. We were happy to at least have one to give. This bike went to a young man who had to go get his license the following day for a job interview. <strong>The look on his face when told he had his ride was unforgettable</strong>, and left an everlasting impression on our hearts.

Our team understands what our challenges are with creating a start up venture and we are committed to overcoming them. Your support will help provide a solid foundation for this business and help fuel our determination for success!
Our plan to solve challenges is to be prepared financially and to be aware. Our team has a business plan that covers the needs to begin operations of this store. We will begin online if financially it makes sense, depending on the success of this campaign. We will continue to grow the business until we are able to open a brick and mortar storefront. We plan to take each step with concise thought and value to our contributors.

<p>Now imagine what it’s like to be a teenager in foster care. As these young people approach legal adulthood, they face tremendous obstacles, including the unrealistic expectation that they will be able to succeed on their own when they turn 18. (Some states have raised the age to up to 21)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485818576/kovlpdihgdsiouu4tzee.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In fact, over the past decade, more than 200,000 teenagers have aged out of foster care at 18 - often without achieving permanent family connections or those critical building blocks of support. Consequently, too many of them face challenges immediately upon leaving foster care - challenges that don’t just affect this cohort of young people, but that affect us all.</p>
<p>A study issued in May 2013 by the Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative — and illustrated in a new infographic — shows that, on average, for every young person who ages out of foster care, taxpayers and communities pay $300,000 in social costs like public assistance, incarceration, and lost wages to a community over that person’s lifetime. Do the math and you can conservatively estimate that this problem incurs almost $8 billion in social costs to the United States every year.</p>
<p><strong>It’s time to do something.</strong> The case for investing in youth aging out of foster care is a powerful one. Major savings are not only possible, but they are achievable in the relatively near term. The most costly outcomes — and the ones that hurt young people the most — come as a result of events, decisions, and behaviors that occur within a few years or even within days of leaving foster care, like becoming homeless or dropping out of school. For many of these youth, the challenges that start in their teen years and early 20s, such as academic failure or unplanned pregnancies, continue throughout the rest of their lives.</p>
<p><strong>So what can we do? Like many social problems, the answer lies in prevention.</strong></p>
<p>I personally feel the need to do my part, as I understand better than anyone the struggles and obstacles they truly face.</p>
<p><strong>This is where you come in!</strong></p>

<p><strong>I want to open a bakery…..not just any bakery</strong>. I have been baking my entire life. It was my therapy while in the foster care system. I have managed and worked at many bakeries and it has always been my passion and calling.  I want to employ children getting ready to age out of the system. I want to teach them skills required in everyday life. For example, customer service skills, cooking, budgeting and monetary responsibility. But also include skills they can take to their future employers such as, marketing, inventory, following direction and working with a team.</p>
<p> <strong>But most importantly, give them a place they can call home</strong>. A place they can come to for compassion and understanding when no one else understands.</p>
<p><strong>A portion of the bakery’s profits will go towards scholarships for these kids!</strong> After successfully completing a year paid internship, they will be eligible for scholarships.Whether they want to attend college, or attend a trade school, we want to be able to give them that option.</p>
<p><strong>We will also have a General Fund </strong>they can borrow from at a 0% interest and paid back in manageable low monthly paycheck deductions, not only to teach responsibility but to have a sense of accomplishment. This fund will be used to purchase furniture for their first apartment, pay deposits for utility services, purchase interview attire, or other expenses that they require that so many of us that have parents or a support unit take for granted.  With little or no family, many of these kids have no one to assist them with the everyday costs associated with adult life.</p>
<p><strong>How Can You Help?!</strong></p>
<p>The money raised through this campaign would go toward:</p>
<p><strong>Space:</strong> We found the space, but it needs work..we will do most of the remodel...and a hood exhaust! (tad expensive)</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Inventory...Flour Sugar, Eggs, Butter, etc...you know, the yummy stuff! (which can definitely come at a cost!)</p>
<p><strong>Equipment: </strong>We need ovens, mixers, tools, display cases, bakeware….everything associated with opening a bakery.</p>
<p><strong>Packaging:</strong> I'm looking into streamlining the packaging to create a unique brand identity. Our boxes and packaging will tie into the Yeasty Boyz name... Our boxes will be 80's Boom boxes!! (If youre a child of the 80's...you will totally relate. Like Totally!)</p>
<p><strong>Seating: </strong>Tables, chairs....we want to teach baking classes as well to get the community more involved!</p>
<p> Please, not only help me open a bakery, but help me raise these kids up to their highest potential....<strong>it takes a village, or maybe a bakery! </strong></p>
