Do all phones support NFC?</b></p><p>Ans: Almost all phones today have NFC. You can check if your phone has NFC from this list <a href=""http://www.nfcworld.com/nfc-phones-list/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. The iPhone does not support the NFC technology. <br/><br/><b>3. What is the Wafer tag?</b></p><p>Ans: The Wafer tag is an NFC tag. A tag that has a microchip that allows you to store small payloads of data on it. This data can be accessed by any NFC-enabled device, when it is within range.<br/><br/><b>4. What kind of data can be stored on the Wafer tag?</b></p><p>Ans: You can store various kinds of information on the Wafer tag, like URLs, Phone numbers, email ID's, messages etc. You can also launch apps on your device or change different settings on your phone using the tag.<br/><br/><b>5. How do I store data on the Wafer tag?</b></p><p>Ans: There are various NFC writer apps available in the Android, Windows, Nokia and the Blackberry app stores. You can use any of these apps to store data on the wafer tag and interact with it. We have listed some of them in our 'App support' section on this campaign page. </p><p><br/><b>6.

(NFC) technology.                                                    Click here1. Our Story2. Features 3. Tech Specs 4. Competitors 5. Support us 6. FAQOur goal was to design a product that is not only top-notch in
terms of build, design and features, but something that would effortlessly work
with all existing NFC-enabled devices. We
discovered that most of the NFC tags out there do not support all the
NFC-enabled devices. The reason behind this is:

The
     tags are of a 'type' which isn't supported by the older
     generation of NFC-enabled devices.
Or
     the tags aren't NFC forum compliant.
So, we decided to design a tag that is compatible with all
NFC-enabled devices.Now you don't have to worry about sharing things with someone
who doesn't have a similar phone as you. The Wafer tag is compatible with all
NFC-enabled devices.Also,
we made sure Wafer works flawlessly with all the NFC writer apps in the
Android market or the Windows phone store.
That’s not all!
To
make the Wafer tag even more awesome, we brought in the customization option
and a wide range of colors to choose from.The Wafer tag is not just another NFC tag. Choose your tag from a wide range of colors. The Wafer tag comes in Dodger Blue, Lime Green, Crimson Red, Orange, Dandelion Yellow for the Trendy.And of course, in Snow White.In order to make interaction with the
Wafer tags more convenient we included the option of customization. With
this option you can add your own text to your tag, and will print customized Wafer tags for you. Now you can have unique
personalized tags for all your tasks. This way you
will never forget what task each tag is assigned.NOTE; The text limit is up to 20 letters. When you choose the customized Wafer tag perk, make sure you fill the form to send us your message to be printed. One of the key aspects while designing the Wafer tag was
compatibility. We made sure that the tag would work with all the NFC devices out there, whether it was one of the older generation devices or the newer
ones.The Wafer tag is NDEF formatted. We have tested
our prototype with different NFC-enabled devices. It works without any
issues. The Wafer tag does not work with the iPhone because the iPhone does not support the NFC technology.The Wafer tag can be written, erased, locked or re-written using any NFC-writer and interactor application. You could either use your existing NFC writer app or we have listed some of the popular NFC apps for different platforms which you could use with the Wafer tag: AndroidDownload it HereWindowsDownload it HereSymbian Download it HereBlackberry Download it Here*Best buy.**As per Samsung website, US.***Requires NFED formatting to work with all devices.The price mentioned above for the Wafer tag is for the Non-Early bird perks, the early bird perks are cheaper but limited.NOTE: All the above mentioned prices are excluding Shipping charges.We have been working on the Wafer tag for the
last 3 months. After a lot of iterations, we finalized the design and made sure
that there are no issues regarding its compatibility with different NFC devices
and interaction with it.So far, we have known that the applications of
the NFC technology are vast, but the issue being its compatibility with all devices,
user-friendliness and the price tag people haven’t been keen on adopting it.
We the Wafer team have taken care of all these
factors and made the perfect NFC tag for everyone.Your
funds will be used for the production of the Wafer tags in large numbers. Choose a perk that suits your needs, or be a backer by making a contribution

</div></div>","We’re saving you from cables and all complexity. Roboting is interchangeable part robotics development system. It’s designed for both hobbyists and developers. Everything is open-sourced and 3D printable.With Roboting, you might easily snap variety of modules together, to build your dream robot. Your Roboting story begins with a base module. It can be a tank drive, car, hovercraft or even a boat! Then, it finds personality with mission modules. These are robotic arms, range finders, surveillance kits or object throwers. Finally, surround modules add sensing capabilities to your robot, with distance sensors, GPS and compass modules. Everything is plug and play.Now, it’s time to play with your robot. It’s easy to control Roboting with Kinect®, Leap Motion®, Gamepad or mobile devices without any technical experience. It’s just like playing with an R/C car.If you’re a programmer, you’re welcome to use our API’s to program Roboting®. Even you may use your own Arduino® or .NET Micro Framework boards. Roboting accepts all.You might want to buy Roboting modules as a final product, or download STL files to 3D print your very own robot.We’re trying our hardest to make Roboting ready before 2014 ends!
Here is the Roboting!
We’re living in
connected devices era, where more and more devices get IP addresses every day.
Our robots deserve that too. In Roboting, we’re orchestrating hardware,
software, and cloud perfectly, hence you’ll get the ultimate connected device.
Let’s take a look at how we’re connecting these things.H for HardwareCustomizing your own
robot is so easy with Roboting. We have three parts.
Base Modules
These are the bodies
of your robot. Each module has its own characteristics and easily upgradable
parts. We have three base modules now, and more bases will be added to our
inventory soon. Our current base modules are:
Car: Like an R/C car,
but there is more. The car module has 4 motor slots, so you are free to choose
from DC and brushless motors. We have also steering servo kit options for the
front wheels.Boat: Have you ever imagined a robot on the water? It's possible with Roboting! The boat has upgradable motors, interchangeable sensor and mission modules.Hovercraft: With its air pressured body, hovercraft makes the robot move on both land and water.
Mission Modules
Here is the fun factor
comes! These modules add main mission functionality to your robot. They are
plug and play, so Roboting automatically detects and sets the modules. Now we
have three mission modules and working on others.
Robotic Arm: For
grabbing and moving things, we have 3 DOF and one grabber parts.
Object Thrower: It’s
easy to aim on your target and throw something to it. Object thrower is a fun
way to enjoy with your robot. It has pan and tilt servos and two throwers.
Security Camera: This
module captures the moments and saves or streams the recordings to the
internet. The camera has pan and tilt servos, and waterproof design.These are the some possibilities, when we combine base and mission modules. Except for the some limitations, each mission module will be compatible with each base module.
Surround Modules
To make your device an
autonomous robot, we need some sensors. Surround modules are interchangeable
and plug and play parts that make your robot detect its surroundings. We're currently working on disrance, light and compass sensors.Combining everything together, we have a modular robotics system.Controller ModuleAs we're supporting open-source, we're also happy to say that you are free to choose your embedded platform. Roboting® is Arduino® compatible, therefore you may use your favorite Arduino board. We also support Netduino® and STM32 boards. The details will be announced soon.S for SoftwareA great hardware complements with a great software. We're excelling Roboting's software for both hobbyists and programmers.Control PanelAn easy to use user experience is waiting for hobbyists.Our control panel, called Roboting Maestro, connects with your robot over the Bluetooth, WiFi or Internet. It detects all the modules and sensors on your robot, and then shows their respective controls.It is possible to use a gamepad, Kinect®, or Leap Motion® sensor to control the robot. Everything is engineering so perfectly for the hobbyists to use the functions without any programming experience.More details and best practices are coming soon.APIRoboting is more than a remote controlled device. With our open sourced API's, its easy to communicate with each module. Currently we're working on Arduino, .NET Micro Framework and STM32 firmwares and C# API. We'll add other platforms soon.C for CloudSoon, we're going to start adding cloud functionalities, such as;Controlling your robot over the internet,Remote data logging, andVideo transport.Project DiaryOn March 2014, we moved to San Francisto to make up the Roboting. We attended as many meetups as we can to get people's opinions. In the meantime, we developed Roboting's first concept prototype, which is being controlled by a gamepad over the Bluetooth.Then, we optimized the firmware and API's to make a robust infrastructure. Everything is made modular, to accept any future models easily. By the time, we decided which base and mission modules to add into our inventory.On June, we started to build SolidWorks® drawings of the models.On July, it was the time of a new beginning! We 3D printed Roboting's first parts. Then, we optimized them for the right size and 3D printable structure. We hired a workspace on TechShop San Francisco to access tools and space we needed. Here are the first 3D prints:7/11/2014: Side parts of car base, sensor and motor modules, controller box slot.7/16/2014: Top and bottom parts of car body.7/18/2014: Robotic arm grabber module parts.7/18/2014: Building the grabber.


7/23/2014: Our first workshop at TechShop San Francisco!

7/23/2014: Invested on a 3D Printer for better prototyping results.


7/26/2014: Wheel kits are ready!
7/31/2014: Hovercraft model is made.



We're continuously working on module development and 3D optimization.

You're welcome to visit our blog at www.roboting.io/blog to get involved with our recent activities.
We Need Your Support!
However we're making the 3D prints and software development, we need some financing for;
Injection molding of the parts,Circuit board production,Sensor development,Marketing, andPackaging.
With your help, we're going to build the world's most user friendly open-sourced robotics system.
Here is our projected timeline:

25 miles, or (40km) depending on varying driving conditions.<br/><br/><b> WHAT MAKES THE COMMUTE-CASE<b>™</b>  GO SO FAR ON A SINGLE  CHARGE?</b><br/>
Commute-Case™ is powered by a proprietary state of the art nano-phosphate
lithium-ion battery pack, connected to an awesomely powerful mega torque,
permanent magnet,  DC motor.<br/><br/><b>HOW IS THE BATTERY PACK RECHARGED?</b><br/>
Recharging to full capacity takes about 5 minutes to 1 hour by plugging the charger
cord into any standard home/office 120 volt or 220 volt wall outlet. Each
COMMUTE-CASE™ will be shipped with a power supply compatible with the customer’s
location. E.g., if you live in a country with 220 volt outlets, you will
receive a COMMUTE-CASE™ made to plug into a 220 volt outlet to recharge.<br/><br/><b>WHAT ABOUT LEGALITY?</b><br/>
Since Commute-Case™ is classified as a ""Electric Personal Assistive
Mobility Device"" by the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Board, rather than
the U.S Department of Transportation, it is regulated as a consumer product,
rather than a motor vehicle, and therefore does not require state motor vehicle
registration, license plates or a driver’s license. In general, it can be
driven anywhere pedal bicycles are allowed to be operated, by adults 18 and
over.<br/><br/><b>HOW IS COMMUTE-CASE™ OPERATED IN DEPLOYED RIDE MODE?</b><br/>
Commute-Case™ is a ""stand-on"" unit, at present. However, an optional

Over the years, countless hours of R&D have been devoted into making this dream a reality. With the rise of crowd funding and technological advancements, the Commute-Case can migrate from a mere prototype to a consumer product.As far as engineering is concerned, technological improvements in batteries and electric motors allows for the COMMUTE-CASE ™ to be feasible. This is where you come in. Your contribution will allow us to finalize the prototyping stage and prepare for mass production to make this innovation a reality.Below you can view videos of the latest design in the prototyping stage, and an early prototype that serves as a proof of concept.

PRODUCT REVIEW


 COMPACT DESIGNVERSATILEHOW TO RIDE THE COMMUTE-CASEAfter the left and right footrests (or wings as some refer to them) deploy, along with the steering column, front and rear wheels, the Commute-Case ™ is now in ride mode.  Grabbing the steering column of the Commute-Case ™, the rider simply straddles over the deployed unit, (much like one straddles a bicycle), placing his or her left foot onto the left footrest, or, placing the right foot on the right footrest, whichever seems most  comfortable. Next, the rider pushes the Commute-Case ™ forward slowly. Once forward movement begins, the rider adds the other foot onto the remaining open footrest. The Commute-Case ™ rider is now in powered forward motion, using the push button accelerator and manual lever brake to control the forward speed (up to 12.5 M.P.H.), and to slow down and stop the vehicle.         NOTE: The Commute-Case ™ is a Stand-On vehicle only,  when the unit is in ride mode.  You do not ever sit on the product, in any of its three modes. However, a seat attachment option may be considered for future models, as we receive more  customer feedback. For those using Commute-Case ™ for local shopping, a handy flexible fabric shopping bag that expands when filled, attached to the case in trolley mode will function as a shopping cart while in the store. This optional shopping bag relocates above the rear wheel when returning from store. Both of these options/features are currently not available. However, when these options become available, they will be compatible with the purchased unit. FEATURES AND SPECIFICATIONS

<p> Yela is a mobile application that inspires trade between communities. Creating the first app that combines Transportation, Services, Space and Products on your smartphone. Location based, with chat and calling functions. The App functions online as well as offline due to our integrated mesh system. Smartphone to smartphone mobile payments. Yela is an on-demand app made for both the consumer and the provider. </p>
<p>  Here are some easy to understand concepts. </p>
<p>  <b>Transport</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Stuck
in traffic and want to get somewhere fast? Use YELA to see what mode of
transportation is within your budget range. 
For example maybe a taxi, a rental car or limousine.  Too slow? How about a motorbike or helicopter
instead! </p>
<p>  <b>Services</b></p>
<p> You just got to the office and want a new suit. Use Yela to get the tailor to your doorstep and do the fitting. Need your offices cleaned the same day? Hire a cleaner based on your GPS location. Choose the best reviewed cleaner and get your office cleaned asap. </p>
<p>  <b>Space</b></p>
<p>Just landed in Timbaktu  and have no clue where to stay? Open Yela and see whats available around you. Find the best reviewed location for the price you want, all within your GPS location.</p>
<p>  <b>Products</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>-<span>  </span>In the
office but you don’t feel like eating at the same old restaurants? Check YELA
and find someone selling home cooked meals around you.  Did it just start raining and you need an
umbrella?  Check YELA products to see if
it’s sold close by.</p>
<p>Life gets simpler when everything around you is accessible
with a simple click of a button.</p>
<p>Imagine using YELA with your local currency choice.  If you’re in Vietnam and someone is charging
you 2.2 million Vietnamese Dong; you don’t need to worry because your side of
the app will show you its $100 USD.  You
will never be cheated or short changed as it acts as a POS system for vendors. </p>

<p>At YELA, we are all avid users of On Demand technology who
aim to make YELA a part of everyone’s life. 
YELA has been created with both the consumer and seller in mind as the
next logical step in the evolution of On Demand technology.  Innovation is what is needed and expected
today.</p>
<p>YELA is a simple app that allows for brand loyalty with a
desirable reward system for using what is today, normal ‘touch button to
reality’ deliverables.  With the amount
of smartphone users today and the huge amount of apps available to users, YELA
makes it more appealing to have something that allows you to start
micro-economies and making life simpler without the need for paying extra for
things like data charges.  </p>
<p>YELA is the one app that does it all and makes your life
easier.  Complete reviews of both
consumers and vendors alike will provide people with a wiser decision making
tool.  This ensures quality, security and
reliability.  We won’t give you a false
sense of security or give users with little to no experience, less of a chance
to work.  It is all based and rated by
review of your peers with in and on the system before you choose who you buy or
sell to. </p>

<p>  Our vision is to inspire trade between communities worldwide. We have so many resources available around us, yet an easy platform to connect us all is missing. We all have something to share, sell, rent or produce. Yela will be the platform to connect with the people around you at the touch of a button. Giving everyone the opportunity to participate in the on demand economy while giving security with smartphone to smartphone payments. With 50 billion smartphones worldwide we foresee a (mesh network) connected world. </p>

<p><b>Mesh Networks</b></p>
<p>A mesh network is a network connection that connects smartphones together. Connecting the smartphones together the mesh network will enable connectivity without connecting to ""the internet"". The mesh network gets stronger when many people are using it.This means that when Yela is used in your community, offline trade and payments will be possible. We believe this will change the game, as smartphone numbers continue to grow rapidly each year. We also think about third world countries where people are getting better access to smartphones but still lack the money to pay for a reliable internet connection. These communities can trade, offer services to each other and chat through the mesh network.</p>

<p><b>Humanitarian Mode</b></p>

<p>When disaster strikes more often than not communication lines are cut off. Yela wants to help communities, areas and regions affected by natural disasters or any other form of emergency by being a tool that assists in rebuilding and rescue efforts.</p>
<p>The services module of Yela will facilitate the location of volunteers and people who are equipped to help out when disasters occur. The Yela App will serve as an effective bridge between rescue workers and trapped survivors, and aid the success of recovery efforts and the rescue of human lives through the real-time nature of the App.</p>
<p>The transport module of Yela will make it possible to request and provide transport to all affected areas.</p>
<p>The products module of Yela will enable NGO's to showcase their available supplies on the App following which volunteer workers can mobilise them for delivery to designated pick up points. Through Yela, they will know exactly what supplies are required and tailor the perfect fit of essentials such as medicine, food and clothing to the needs of victims.</p>
<p>Look at Yela as not only a new but more importantly essential communication tool in times of emergency or when disaster strikes when all conventional channels of communication are down.Through Yela's off grid capabilities people can continue to call and text each other, ensuring more people are saved and supplied with their needs. </p>
<p>The Yela App will operate in humanitarian mode in disaster and emergency zones.In this mode, usage of the Yela App will be completely free of charge. </p>

<p>The implementation of our idea has certain risks which are governments regulations and the local countries natural business , we are in no ways being in competition but trying to make things more easy to deal with and encouraging more trade.</p>
<p>Example Malaysia is not for on demand drivers as it has a local authority using metered taxis and wants the apps only approved by them. This is also the case in France and and Washington DC. We have developed the app where taxis can use it , people can call for them using the app the taxis can respond.. use their own meter and plug in the figures of the amount into the app to be charged cashless. We have made a solution, which solves the problem.</p>
<p>If we do not get the total amount we obviously will scale and do things more slowly but surely. With the amount of exposure and publicity we are sure to run into many VC and are ready also to sell equity to get where we want. </p>

</div></div>","Yela is a mobile application that inspires trade between communities. Creating the first app that combines Transportation, Services, Space and Products on your smartphone. Location based, with chat and calling functions. The App functions online as well as offline due to our integrated mesh system. Smartphone to smartphone mobile payments. Yela is an on-demand app made for both the consumer and the provider. 
  Here are some easy to understand concepts. 
  Transport

Stuck
in traffic and want to get somewhere fast? Use YELA to see what mode of
transportation is within your budget range. 
For example maybe a taxi, a rental car or limousine.  Too slow? How about a motorbike or helicopter
instead! 
  Services
 You just got to the office and want a new suit. Use Yela to get the tailor to your doorstep and do the fitting. Need your offices cleaned the same day? Hire a cleaner based on your GPS location. Choose the best reviewed cleaner and get your office cleaned asap. 
  Space
Just landed in Timbaktu  and have no clue where to stay? Open Yela and see whats available around you. Find the best reviewed location for the price you want, all within your GPS location.
  Products

-  In the
office but you don’t feel like eating at the same old restaurants? Check YELA
and find someone selling home cooked meals around you.  Did it just start raining and you need an
umbrella?  Check YELA products to see if
it’s sold close by.
Life gets simpler when everything around you is accessible
with a simple click of a button.
Imagine using YELA with your local currency choice.  If you’re in Vietnam and someone is charging
you 2.2 million Vietnamese Dong; you don’t need to worry because your side of
the app will show you its $100 USD.  You
will never be cheated or short changed as it acts as a POS system for vendors. 


 



At YELA, we are all avid users of On Demand technology who
aim to make YELA a part of everyone’s life. 
YELA has been created with both the consumer and seller in mind as the
next logical step in the evolution of On Demand technology.  Innovation is what is needed and expected
today.
YELA is a simple app that allows for brand loyalty with a
desirable reward system for using what is today, normal ‘touch button to
reality’ deliverables.  With the amount
of smartphone users today and the huge amount of apps available to users, YELA
makes it more appealing to have something that allows you to start
micro-economies and making life simpler without the need for paying extra for
things like data charges.  
YELA is the one app that does it all and makes your life
easier.  Complete reviews of both
consumers and vendors alike will provide people with a wiser decision making
tool.  This ensures quality, security and
reliability.  We won’t give you a false
sense of security or give users with little to no experience, less of a chance
to work.  It is all based and rated by
review of your peers with in and on the system before you choose who you buy or
sell to. 
 

The core team of Yela contains 7 people. 
The founder of Yela is Ritish Dorai. Delighted to share our creation and appreciating any help that can be given to making Yela into reality. 
Marnix Troudes is running the Online Presence and helped build Yela from the ground up along with Ritish. 
Jesper Terkelsen is Head of Business Development and handles all future partnerships. 
Adrienne is a director of the company and serves as Financial Controller. With more than 25 years of experience in Investment Banking she's a great addition to our team.
Advent Phang and Alvin Chua are the owners of the development team that created the base for the Yela App. The App is being built by Infinity Labs Sdn. Bhd. and are involved in a shareholder partnership with Yela.
Zeeshan Ahmed Heads the Development Team


What we are solving and passionate about..
  Our vision is to inspire trade between communities worldwide. We have so many resources available around us, yet an easy platform to connect us all is missing. We all have something to share, sell, rent or produce. Yela will be the platform to connect with the people around you at the touch of a button. Giving everyone the opportunity to participate in the on demand economy while giving security with smartphone to smartphone payments. With 50 billion smartphones worldwide we foresee a (mesh network) connected world. 



Filling the need to connect all under one roof. 

Having the App review based so you always connect to the best vendors and service providers.
Best value for money
Giving everyone the possibility to compete on quality service

Offline and online wallet system



Mesh Networks
A mesh network is a network connection that connects smartphones together. Connecting the smartphones together the mesh network will enable connectivity without connecting to ""the internet"". The mesh network gets stronger when many people are using it.This means that when Yela is used in your community, offline trade and payments will be possible. We believe this will change the game, as smartphone numbers continue to grow rapidly each year. We also think about third world countries where people are getting better access to smartphones but still lack the money to pay for a reliable internet connection. These communities can trade, offer services to each other and chat through the mesh network.

Humanitarian Mode

When disaster strikes more often than not communication lines are cut off. Yela wants to help communities, areas and regions affected by natural disasters or any other form of emergency by being a tool that assists in rebuilding and rescue efforts.
The services module of Yela will facilitate the location of volunteers and people who are equipped to help out when disasters occur. The Yela App will serve as an effective bridge between rescue workers and trapped survivors, and aid the success of recovery efforts and the rescue of human lives through the real-time nature of the App.
The transport module of Yela will make it possible to request and provide transport to all affected areas.
The products module of Yela will enable NGO's to showcase their available supplies on the App following which volunteer workers can mobilise them for delivery to designated pick up points. Through Yela, they will know exactly what supplies are required and tailor the perfect fit of essentials such as medicine, food and clothing to the needs of victims.
Look at Yela as not only a new but more importantly essential communication tool in times of emergency or when disaster strikes when all conventional channels of communication are down.Through Yela's off grid capabilities people can continue to call and text each other, ensuring more people are saved and supplied with their needs. 
The Yela App will operate in humanitarian mode in disaster and emergency zones.In this mode, usage of the Yela App will be completely free of charge. 

What’s your plan, and what’s your schedule?
 To be able to complete, test and launch Yela fully in 2016. The other modules will just complement the system which will already run from December 2015.
  The App is being developed with Xamarin and can be cross translated to any platform. IOS, Windows, blackberry etc.


Normal Apps cost any where between  3k to 30k to make 
more specialized Apps cost 100k to even more
Our app also has evolved into some thing awesome from its original
plan
We have 4 on demand capabilities.
Wireless connectivity phone to phone encrypted. 
on and offline wallets with encryption with block chain sync
chat and calls. 
Review system.
And as we have covered 75% of the development.  
We are here in need of your help
We are here.

Is there shipping charges and when will the items be sent.


Shipping charges are separate and we will send them the fastest and safest ways
By mid January we would have sent every one their perks.










We are building something that is off-line and on-line with huge amount transactions we will need to have our own AWS servers with a complete 24/7 development working team. This will be the brunt of the expenditure.
We are 75% complete and with these we can secure what would be first database of its kind with data, on the off-line users in the world. 100k. 
We need 40k to setup and launch to our neighboring markets with minimal amount of hiring. 
30k more would go into running costs. 
10k would go into dispersing perks. 
 

300k we will be able to fully launch in South East Asia.
400k we will be able to develop the offline wallets fully with block chain capabilities
500k we will we will be able to launch in Asia fully
1 million we will we will be able to launch globally
 

The implementation of our idea has certain risks which are governments regulations and the local countries natural business , we are in no ways being in competition but trying to make things more easy to deal with and encouraging more trade.
Example Malaysia is not for on demand drivers as it has a local authority using metered taxis and wants the apps only approved by them. This is also the case in France and and Washington DC. We have developed the app where taxis can use it , people can call for them using the app the taxis can respond.. use their own meter and plug in the figures of the amount into the app to be charged cashless. We have made a solution, which solves the problem.
If we do not get the total amount we obviously will scale and do things more slowly but surely. With the amount of exposure and publicity we are sure to run into many VC and are ready also to sell equity to get where we want.

Hands-on: VOLTA Spark Review By 9to5Mac  
""VOLTA has earned a reputation for delivering high-quality products with serious durability after four very successful crowdfunding campaigns​"" 9to5MacHands-on: VOLTA Spark Review By Joshua Vergara   """"VOLTA Spark Charger: Is this cable THE ONE?""Joshua Vergara  The MagSafe is Back and Better

Like MagSafe, VOLTA Spark offers an extra protection by detaching from your device instantly if you accidentally snag the cord.

A lot of Apple users raised concerns about the shocking removal of the MagSafe feature from the newer MacBooks with only USB-C ports. With the launch of VOLTA Spark, you can expect to get this feature back.Power any device with a micro USB, USB C (Universal/Android) or Lightning port (Apple). VOLTA Spark ‎features the most universal cross-device compatibility of any cable on the market. Imagine: 1 cable charges every device you own.  
Unlike other charging cables, VOLTA Spark is equipped to power all USB-C devices including fast charging for the iPhone X series and MacBook Pro.We designed the Spark cable to provide hassle-free charging for all your devices. Whether ‎you use an iPhone, USB-C Laptops (such as MacBook), a USB-C Android or Micro USB devices or an iPhone, you can now wave good-bye to fumbling around to charge ‎any of your devices.
You can now transform your phone into a battery pack with VOLTA SparkOn-The-Go charging functionality allows you to share charge between your devices without the need for a charger or a power bank. Spark has passed the most advanced reliability tests to prove it will outlast any other cable ‎no matter what you do to it. (Short of taking an axe to it!).

18K gold-plated copper core plug guarantee a lightning-fast charge. 

18K gold-plated needles deliver a faster, more stable current to your device.
3 layers of military-grade PVC protection, & anti-corrosive nickel-plating means your Spark will last forever. 


Two perfectly aligned, N52-grade Neodymium reversible magnets in 360° orientation – at both ends – deliver an immediate, powerful connection in an instant. No more stabbing your device to death trying to connect for a charge. Just get the end of the cable close to the connector, and it snaps right into place.

VOLTA Spark connects (or disconnects) to your devices instantly, without effort. This is ‎especially useful at night when you’re trying to get a charge in the dark.

If there is something we all know, every brand wants you to keep coming back to them. One ‎infamous way they accomplish this is through the accompanied charger. We’ve all been ‎there. A few weeks, a few months using your brand new phone, and you're waiting in line to ‎replace a charger that was never designed to outlast its phone. ‎
The same companies that innovate with advanced fingerprint technology (and more) have never ‎looked into making a long-lasting cable – no matter how easy it is for them with talented design teams and billions in revenue. ‎Why? Because it means they lose out on a profitable income stream.VOLTA ‎Spark is here to change that. 

Say goodbye to visiting the store every few months to buy yet another charger – you’ll be buying the VOLTA Spark only once.
Here at VOLTA, we provide you with a cable that is 10 times stronger than the average ‎cable out there. The confidence in the strength and durability of VOLTA is apparent ‎through our Lifetime Guarantee that comes with every purchase. ‎Research into the strongest and most efficient materials has been done to ensure the ‎durability of every cable we ship.
The sturdy, anti-scratch aluminum shielding ensures the ‎lasting, pristine condition of the connectors. PBV braiding and intelligent strain-relief collars ‎on the cable give it astounding agility, strength, and flexibility to enable our cables to be ‎strong enough to lift a brick or pull a vehicle.

 1. Insert the charging tip into the port of your USB device or Smartphone or Laptop.  2. The VOLTA Spark will magnetically connect when placed near the tip inside your device(s)  3. The Smart LED let you know Your Device is Charging!  

 VOLTA Spark Charge and sync at speed 480mbps. Less time plugged in, more time going out!

 Grossed out by all the gunk hanging out in your charging ports? Truth is, it’s slowly killing your devices and reducing their ability to power up. Add in all the wear and tear of constantly shoving in and pulling out chargers and it’s a no-brainer that avoiding all that is a smart decision.Spark tip stays put. By protecting this sensitive area from dust and dirt, and safeguarding it from all that daily abuse, VOLTA extends the life of all of your devices.

<h1>RoboBrrd is Great Fun for Education</h1>
<p>We have shown RoboBrrd at various Maker Faires, and kids are instantly attracted to its soft and friendly appearance. They observe how it works, ask questions about how it functions, and they can envision themselves building one.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""Interacting with RoboBrrd! (Photo by David Cuartielles)"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/235/256/1fbc97a467538c8c5cc3b9947f04a95c_large.jpg?1351614600"" src="""" style=""""/>Interacting with RoboBrrd! (Photo by David Cuartielles)</div>
<p>The hands-on learning experience of building RoboBrrd is important to establish problem solving skills that can help in future robotic projects and STEM related studies. RoboBrrd is a great project to bridge the real-world lessons to the theoretical side.</p>
<p>For example: the beak on RoboBrrd is able to open because of a scotch-yoke mechanism, which translates rotational to linear movement.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""So that's how the beak works! Cool!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/235/259/eddd7f311dec70815bf70b2d25a562a0_large.jpg?1351614651"" src="""" style=""""/>So that's how the beak works! Cool!</div>
<p>The real fun begins once RoboBrrd is built and it is time to add on more and modify it! RoboBrrd is quite expandable, and can use various different sensors and actuators. If kids want RoboBrrd to react to sound, they will be able to do that. It is a great way for kids to be creative with science and engineering.</p>
<p>For example: different hats on RoboBrrd to control its behaviours. A modification that uses a NFC shield, some additional code, and NFC tags on hats. This is really fun for kids to play with!</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""Kids love playing with the NFC hats!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/235/262/81f97703349eb9f6268c89f1ad8eb7d8_large.jpg?1351614690"" src="""" style=""""/>Kids love playing with the NFC hats!</div>
<p>The possibilities and ideas for RoboBrrd are only limited by your imagination. Will you make your RoboBrrd have jet packs? Or act delighted (or angry) when someone enters the room? Go for it!</p>

<p> </p>
<h1>Kit Design</h1>
<p>RoboBrrd’s kit design has been streamlined for simplicity in every way. Almost every piece for RoboBrrd serves three purposes for the entire structure. When glued together properly, the structure is very rigid. The wings and beak can withstand minor forces applied and not damage the servos directly. The Brain Board (pcb) fits in the back of RoboBrrd, with adequate room to access the plugs.</p>

</div>
<p>We have stress-tested our kit at Maker Faire, by having kids pick up and shake the RoboBrrd, sometimes accidentally dropping it on the table, or pulling its wings and beak around. It survived the entire weekend!</p>

<p>Our RoboBrrd Brain Board intrinsically encourages a closer look. We included fun doodles of RoboBrrds on the silkscreen. This will encourage kids to look more closely at the board, where they can also investigate the traces and pins, to understand how all of the electrical connections are made!</p>
<p>Additionally, the board has jumpers to select what power source to run the processor off of and for the servos as well. There are screw terminals that are great for making sure the wires stay plugged in.</p>

</div></div>","Hello, Friend of RoboBrrd!
RoboBrrd is a robotic bird character that has an entertaining personality! When you build a RoboBrrd, you get hands-on experience of mechanical and electrical engineering, programming, and add a dash of your own creativity.

Yay RoboBrrd!
The ultimate dream for RoboBrrd is to get more people interested in science and engineering. RoboBrrd provides a way to learn about science and engineering in a creative way. What happens afterwards is magical, by being creative in technical fields, new inventions will appear, there will be better solutions to problems, and even more.

RoboBrrd, the cutest educational robot around, aims to get everyone interested in robotics!
 
What people have been saying:
""RoboBrrd is designed to give kids and other beginners the hands-on experience of mechanical and electrical engineering, and programming, with room for your own imagination."" - Kathy Ceceri, WIRED GeekDad
""From start to finish, building a RoboBrrd will walk you through some basic but essential robo-skills, such as soldering and wiring. Once it's assembled and wired, you will be able to have it to flap its wings and work its beak, but that's just the start."" - Kevin Hall, DVICE
""RoboBrrd fully embraces the Maker philosophy that you don’t really own something unless you can tear it apart and customize it. We need to let kids know that it’s OK to do this, that it’s not off-limits. The best way to learn is to tinker. If kids are afraid to touch a robot lest they break it, how can we expect to them to ever build up confidence that they can create something on their own?"" - Robert Lysik
""[...] kids absolutely love them. It's a great way to get started on both the hardware and software of robotics"" - Evan Ackerman, IEEE Automaton
Also seen on MAKE, Robots.net, EMSL, Seeedstudio, Adafruit, and Techfieber.de!
 
NEW Funding Stretch Goal #1!
We have met our initial funding goal, but let's soar further! Fwooosh!
If we meet Stretch Goal #1, we'll add in:
• 1 Piezo speaker to each RoboBrrd Kit (make chirping sounds!)
• 1 Customized 'mood changing' pencil (plan taking over the world by RoboBrrds, using this pencil)
• 1 Special not-seen-before RoboBrrd token for the occasion (hint: it will have lots of drawings of stars on it!)
This will happen if we reach: $15,494
It's possible, we can definitely reach it! This is a great opportunity to try and get even more people interested in robotics.
 
RoboBrrd is Great Fun for Education
We have shown RoboBrrd at various Maker Faires, and kids are instantly attracted to its soft and friendly appearance. They observe how it works, ask questions about how it functions, and they can envision themselves building one.

Interacting with RoboBrrd! (Photo by David Cuartielles)
The hands-on learning experience of building RoboBrrd is important to establish problem solving skills that can help in future robotic projects and STEM related studies. RoboBrrd is a great project to bridge the real-world lessons to the theoretical side.
For example: the beak on RoboBrrd is able to open because of a scotch-yoke mechanism, which translates rotational to linear movement.

So that's how the beak works! Cool!
The real fun begins once RoboBrrd is built and it is time to add on more and modify it! RoboBrrd is quite expandable, and can use various different sensors and actuators. If kids want RoboBrrd to react to sound, they will be able to do that. It is a great way for kids to be creative with science and engineering.
For example: different hats on RoboBrrd to control its behaviours. A modification that uses a NFC shield, some additional code, and NFC tags on hats. This is really fun for kids to play with!

Kids love playing with the NFC hats!
The possibilities and ideas for RoboBrrd are only limited by your imagination. Will you make your RoboBrrd have jet packs? Or act delighted (or angry) when someone enters the room? Go for it!

You can have a lot of fun building a RoboBrrd!
 
RoboBrrd Kit
This is what the RoboBrrd kit looks like!

RoboBrrd Kit! (Constructed)
This is what the RoboBrrd Brain Board functional prototype looks like

RoboBrrd Brain Board
The RoboBrrd Kit contains: 

15 Laser cut interlocking pieces
3 Micro servos for beak and both wings
2 RGB LEDs for the eyes
2 Light sensors
1 Temperature sensor
1 RoboBrrd Brain Board pack (includes board and all components)
Online tutorials and resources available
Tools and supplies that you will need: 

Hot glue & wood glue
FTDI cable / friend
Solder, soldering iron, wire
Screw driver
Cutters and pliers
Googely eyes
Here are photos of all of the pieces:

Pieces #1-6


Pieces #7-15
Only 15 pieces to create an entire RoboBrrd!
You won't be left confused during the build of RoboBrrd, as we have very handy video tutorials! Here is part 1 in the series!

We have stress-tested our kit at Maker Faire, by having kids pick up and shake the RoboBrrd, sometimes accidentally dropping it on the table, or pulling its wings and beak around. It survived the entire weekend!

Seagull RoboBrrd still working!
Our RoboBrrd Brain Board intrinsically encourages a closer look. We included fun doodles of RoboBrrds on the silkscreen. This will encourage kids to look more closely at the board, where they can also investigate the traces and pins, to understand how all of the electrical connections are made!
Additionally, the board has jumpers to select what power source to run the processor off of and for the servos as well. There are screw terminals that are great for making sure the wires stay plugged in.

Assembled RoboBrrd Brain Board
As for programming, we have plenty examples online of how to extend the RoboBrrd to communicate with Google+ Hangouts, the Internet of Things, your iOS devices, Android devices, your computer, and we plan on making many more in the future as well!

We see the difficulties for some student to understand basic concept of electronics and robotics. We want to share our passion of electronics by creating a fun and easy way to learn electronics and robotics.<br/><br/>We made this design open source so that everyone can make their own robot and learn at their own pace. This campaign is to encourage anyone interested in electronics to explore the possibility of making their own robot. <br/><br/>Zummi is designed with minimal surface mount and through hole soldering. This will be a good tool for introduction to soldering. Arduino-Nano is used as basis of the design to make it easy for student to grasp the concept of robotics. Fun add-on was designed to keep student engaged with the learning. Add-on includes robot shooter, robot sniper, and robot servo hook. More add-ons will be added in the future. Block programming is also available for Zummi robot to promote programming culture among students.<br/><br/>Zummi has been program to allow control using IR remote making it more fun to learn. Bluetooth communication is also implemented allowing remote control using android mobile phone. Code for mobile phone using MIT App Inventor is also made available to anyone.<br/><br/>We hope many people will benefit from this simple, affordable and easy to use robot. <br/><br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>The fund will go towards educating anyone interested  with  robotics &amp; electronics by providing opensource design and facilities for the to explore at their own pace. The money will go toward developing Zummi online curriculum for surface mount soldering, 3d design, PCB design and also programming. At the moment we have use our curriculum to teach kids aged 8-15 yo how easy and fun it can be to learn electronics. We need 20k to allow further development of the robot including more video tutorials, sensors, functions and 3D-design. We would like to show that electronics concepts is easy and fun to learn, even kids can learn electronics.<br/><br/>If the goal is stretched more than we anticipated, we will continue the development of Zummi as follows:-<br/><br/><b>USD50000 </b><br/>3 New body design including moving head, RoboCar and Tractor.<br/><br/><b>USD100000 </b><br/>3 new shooter design including cross bow, multiple rubber band shooter and advanced air gun(multishot)<br/><br/><b>USD150000 </b><br/>Bigger version of Zummi with 3 new Arduino based design on  Arduino YUN, UNO and Mega(large design). With integration of both NRF24L01+ and XBee<br/><br/><div>Bluetooth communication has already been integrated with Zummi. This alllow remote control using android mobile phone. Zummi Android Apps  can be downloaded FREE via google app store. <br/>(<a href=""https://play.google.com/stord/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_KokLong90.Zummi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://play.google.com/stord/apps/details?id=a...</a>)<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We have conducted some class introducing Zummi to school children aged 8 to 15 and get good feedback from them.</p>
<p>We would like to make this more easily available for others so that everybody can learn.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>Delay is always an issue for project like this, especially shipping and manufacturing. <br/>The design itself is already complete and we will try our best to avoid delays by communicating with our manufacturing partner. The robot itself only consists of two major part, the electronics board and the 3D-printed material.<br/><br/>We will try to avoid manufacturing delays by using trusted manufacturing partner whom we've already work well with. For prototype, we make most of the fabrication our self, but if this campaign is successful, we will outsource most of the fabrication to professional to ensure speed and stability. <br/><br/>We had already taken into account the shipping delays by including several extra months into the estimated delivery date for manufacturing.    <br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div>We appreciate your contributions in every possible way to make this dream possible. If you cannot contribute in monitory term, please help us by sharing this campaign with your friends and families. Please use the Indiegogo share tool at your disposal.<br/><br/>We hope that Zummi can reach out to everyone and help make electronics education fun and easy.<p></p></div>","Short Summary We are a team of educators and students in electronics.

Code for mobile phone using MIT App Inventor is also made available to anyone.We hope many people will benefit from this simple, affordable and easy to use robot.    What We Need & What You Get The fund will go towards educating anyone interested  with  robotics & electronics by providing opensource design and facilities for the to explore at their own pace. The money will go toward developing Zummi online curriculum for surface mount soldering, 3d design, PCB design and also programming. At the moment we have use our curriculum to teach kids aged 8-15 yo how easy and fun it can be to learn electronics. We need 20k to allow further development of the robot including more video tutorials, sensors, functions and 3D-design. We would like to show that electronics concepts is easy and fun to learn, even kids can learn electronics.If the goal is stretched more than we anticipated, we will continue the development of Zummi as follows:-USD50000 3 New body design including moving head, RoboCar and Tractor.USD100000 3 new shooter design including cross bow, multiple rubber band shooter and advanced air gun(multishot)USD150000 Bigger version of Zummi with 3 new Arduino based design on  Arduino YUN, UNO and Mega(large design). With integration of both NRF24L01+ and XBeeBluetooth communication has already been integrated with Zummi. This alllow remote control using android mobile phone. Zummi Android Apps  can be downloaded FREE via google app store. (https://play.google.com/stord/apps/details?id=a...)

   The Impact We have conducted some class introducing Zummi to school children aged 8 to 15 and get good feedback from them.
We would like to make this more easily available for others so that everybody can learn.
  Risks & Challenges  Delay is always an issue for project like this, especially shipping and manufacturing. The design itself is already complete and we will try our best to avoid delays by communicating with our manufacturing partner. The robot itself only consists of two major part, the electronics board and the 3D-printed material.We will try to avoid manufacturing delays by using trusted manufacturing partner whom we've already work well with. For prototype, we make most of the fabrication our self, but if this campaign is successful, we will outsource most of the fabrication to professional to ensure speed and stability. We had already taken into account the shipping delays by including several extra months into the estimated delivery date for manufacturing.       Other Ways You Can Help 
We appreciate your contributions in every possible way to make this dream possible. If you cannot contribute in monitory term, please help us by sharing this campaign with your friends and families. Please use the Indiegogo share tool at your disposal.We hope that Zummi can reach out to everyone and help make electronics education fun and easy.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We hate complexity. No seriously, we really really hate complex crap. We believe that tablets will be the main method of computing for many small and medium businesses. From the plumber entering a new work order to the home theater store or jeweler displaying all of their products, tablets will lead the way and Fiverun will be the application glue that powers that. How? We have developed a proprietary suite of algorithms which allow us to abstract business apps like ""lego blocks"". Soon we will release these lego blocks to the public, how they will be used will be limited only by your imagination.</p>
<p>Our first app is Showcase. This allows any business to display anything anywhere. Think of your neighborhood jeweler who has a ton of beautiful jewelry stored away, gathering dust. With Showcase, they can now display every bit of product they have to their customers, potentially generating sales. Then, Showcase lets them gather feedback on what their customers like and then let's them share it to their friends.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>I have always been a deep thinker diving into history, archeaology and ancient technologies. When I got married and had children, deep thinking reached a whole new level. Now life was not only about me it’s was about my family and providing them with all they needed to become smart, successful, and good people. One day while playing video games with my children I came to an epiphany. "" Why is it that we spend all this time playing games going online surfing the web and we get nothing for it."" (This game cost $60.00!!!). When we do get rewards it goes back to their site, with trinket rewards, I needed real items that I could use. So I came up with the concept of ""GamerPointsStore"". </span></p>
<p><span>Our Platform gives people a chance to improve their quality of life and simply do better. I have spent 4 years of my life putting together the GamerPointsStore concept/platform. This is not a get rich quick scheme but a belief that we can all share/give through our activities. Many have told me it is a great idea, then took pieces, then slammed the proverbial door in my face. A great company Appetizer Mobile ( <a href=""http://appetizermobile.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://appetizermobile.com</a>) has agreed to build for us, I just need to pay them to receive the app. </span></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our Needs and Why:</p>
<p>We need approximately $95,000 to get the app built. We choose Appetizer Mobile because of their stunnning GUI work and their user devotion.</p>
<p>Approximately $30,000 will go into hiring a team of people to increase our list of vendors. Going after Mom&amp;Pop shops, street artists, people with something to share, etc. My board and current team have and will continue to attract the BIG name vendors (they'll be the ones really footing the bill, for the games you play, videos you see...shhh..don't tell them.)</p>
<p>Approx. $15,000 will go to content developers. Helping us manage what I expect to be a butt-load of the hottest stuff...nothing is too good for our users.</p>
<p>And the final $10,000 will be for hosting, the mobile and website.</p>
<p>Our costs are low because we do alot of the work in house, so as to pass on the savings to our users and vendors.</p>
<p>Check out our unique perks listed below:Hugs cost extra...but the team and I are willing.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal the monies will still go to App Mobile,  we know that with the app built, we can shop it around ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Gamer Points Store is in a unique position. We are a hybrid of all the social media and entertainment sites combined with providing our users with a new form of non intrusive advertising that they benefit from participating in. We call our method the “Social Media savings butler”. </p>
<p>Gamer Points Store will be able to convert the achievements that users get (for example) from playing their favorite games into “ Gamer Points” which translate into discounts at stores of the users own choosing. Our strategy focuses on building a socialplatform, that provides advertising to the users that they want. The non-intrusive discount ads come from stores they already patronize, and also introduce them to new stores that they might want to patronize. This method solves a big problem those advertisers have: which is how do we make people feel like they are not being sold something. Our method will also decrease the cost of advertising for the vendors and fosters customer loyalty in a fun interactive way for the user. This method allows user take an active role in their shopping, savings process and provides vendors a way to test new trends in a non-intrusive way, ( for example) if you are watching a commercial on TV during your favorite program, a special savings coupon from a vendor that you may want to try will be pushed to your mobile device and will ""trigger"" itself at the users convenience. I personally hated when i would be i a store and forgot the coupon on the kitchen table or being out of ink and could not print an ink couopon for my local vendor, that i pass on my way to and from work. These are all things in the past thanks to the GamerPointsStore model. The GPS motto is simple...monetize everything.</p>
<p>I was able to find key players to back me on this project and the others(coming soon) like:</p>
<p>Morgan Margolis: Board of Directors (GamerPointsStore) - CEO of Knitting Factory Entertainment. He currently oversees a vast team of employees in multiple states: handling day-today production of the multi-million-dollar conglomerate including concert houses, touring, management, restaurants, bars, a record label, a lifestyle and retail line and an ever growing Film and Television entertainment division.</p>
<p>Anthony Orrantes: Board of Directors (GamerPointsStore) – Managing Partner of Terra Investimentos (America’s). He is responsible for the external matters of Terra: building partnerships and broader business relationships, government outreach and technology thought leadership, as well as advising the CEO and senior leadership on business and policy issues. He was one of the original founders of Sonic Trading, LLC, which was acquired by Bank of New York and was one of the first direct access trading systems, which revolutionized the way the capital markets operate.</p>
<p>Robert Goldfarb: Board of Directors (GamerPointsStore)- COO of Fragments . He has spent 26 years in managing retail and wholesale environments for QVC, J. Crew, Henri Bendel, and Bloomingdales with experience in P&amp;L responsibility, budgeting, product development, advertising, direct mail and electronic retail.</p>

(This game cost $60.00!!!). When we do get rewards it goes back to their site, with trinket rewards, I needed real items that I could use. So I came up with the concept of ""GamerPointsStore"". 
Our Platform gives people a chance to improve their quality of life and simply do better. I have spent 4 years of my life putting together the GamerPointsStore concept/platform. This is not a get rich quick scheme but a belief that we can all share/give through our activities. Many have told me it is a great idea, then took pieces, then slammed the proverbial door in my face. A great company Appetizer Mobile ( http://appetizermobile.com) has agreed to build for us, I just need to pay them to receive the app. 
What We Need & What You Get


Our Needs and Why:
We need approximately $95,000 to get the app built. We choose Appetizer Mobile because of their stunnning GUI work and their user devotion.
Approximately $30,000 will go into hiring a team of people to increase our list of vendors. Going after Mom&Pop shops, street artists, people with something to share, etc. My board and current team have and will continue to attract the BIG name vendors (they'll be the ones really footing the bill, for the games you play, videos you see...shhh..don't tell them.)
Approx. $15,000 will go to content developers. Helping us manage what I expect to be a butt-load of the hottest stuff...nothing is too good for our users.
And the final $10,000 will be for hosting, the mobile and website.
Our costs are low because we do alot of the work in house, so as to pass on the savings to our users and vendors.
Check out our unique perks listed below:Hugs cost extra...but the team and I are willing.
If we don’t reach our entire goal the monies will still go to App Mobile,  we know that with the app built, we can shop it around ourselves.


The Impact
Gamer Points Store is in a unique position. We are a hybrid of all the social media and entertainment sites combined with providing our users with a new form of non intrusive advertising that they benefit from participating in. We call our method the “Social Media savings butler”. 
Gamer Points Store will be able to convert the achievements that users get (for example) from playing their favorite games into “ Gamer Points” which translate into discounts at stores of the users own choosing. Our strategy focuses on building a socialplatform, that provides advertising to the users that they want. The non-intrusive discount ads come from stores they already patronize, and also introduce them to new stores that they might want to patronize. This method solves a big problem those advertisers have: which is how do we make people feel like they are not being sold something. Our method will also decrease the cost of advertising for the vendors and fosters customer loyalty in a fun interactive way for the user. This method allows user take an active role in their shopping, savings process and provides vendors a way to test new trends in a non-intrusive way, ( for example) if you are watching a commercial on TV during your favorite program, a special savings coupon from a vendor that you may want to try will be pushed to your mobile device and will ""trigger"" itself at the users convenience. I personally hated when i would be i a store and forgot the coupon on the kitchen table or being out of ink and could not print an ink couopon for my local vendor, that i pass on my way to and from work. These are all things in the past thanks to the GamerPointsStore model. The GPS motto is simple...monetize everything.
I was able to find key players to back me on this project and the others(coming soon) like:
Morgan Margolis: Board of Directors (GamerPointsStore) - CEO of Knitting Factory Entertainment. He currently oversees a vast team of employees in multiple states: handling day-today production of the multi-million-dollar conglomerate including concert houses, touring, management, restaurants, bars, a record label, a lifestyle and retail line and an ever growing Film and Television entertainment division.

<h2><strong>Shred Screen Open and Make The Data Free</strong></h2>
<p>For many, many years we can only see, click or touch the visualized data on screen but you can never take it out or drop in data just right on screen. Is that stupid? Kind of. The data is contained in a box with a glass front panel (called as display) the only way to get the data out/in is to press a button to “send or receive” it from one place to another. It is kind of ridiculous and maybe the largest legacy technology surviving right under our eyes everyday but ignoring by us for so long. </p>
<p><br/>Why do not we just pick up a piece of data, pictures, text, videos, colors, links right from the surface of screen and drop it onto another screen? That is simple, intuitive and elegant way to engage the data around us. Hard to say we didn't even think about it but all in Sci-Fi stories.</p>
<p>Guys, it is 2013, that can not stay in Sci-Fi anymore. We are exciting to announce that you can do that with Tagtal tStylus powered by OSP (On-Screen Port) now. And, OSP SDK is going to be open for all developers. </p>
<h3>This is NOT just another stylus but an innovation of human computer interaction. It is also our dream, a dream to have ability to pick, hold, and drop digital data as real matters, a dream we have imagined, novelized, filmed and posted for years.</h3>
<p><strong>Now it is going to be true with your support financially and mentally.If the goal is reached not only we give birth to tStylus but also breakout the jail of data and the ceiling above our imagination. </strong></p>

<h2 align=""left"">Potential Apps </h2>
<p>OSP SDK is going to open to developers, that can be used to create more and more apps or integrated with existing apps (we are approaching more 3rd part app developers to empower more apps to support OSP). </p>
<p><strong>On Screen ID for Online Pay</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">You can also lock or unlock your private information with tStylus securely. You just simply use your tStylus to touch the locked content or login zone on the screen to access securely. The device will check the identity of your tStylus to make sure you have authority to copy or access the content. You do not have to entering your password to login. What you need to do is just keep your tStylus safe, as like a touch key. And all this identity check can be done without user’s interfering at all. We call it capacitive fingerprints of your tStylus. That makes human computer interaction is even more fluent and secure.</p>

The first working prototype is built in 2012 coded as MARK. Since it is such an inspiring capacitive stylus in this world ever there is no clues at all in our way to make it real in the very beginning. In last 12 months, we overcame a lot of challenges or even difficulties and found a way out from darkness to turn the idea into a product.<a href=""http://pinterest.com/tagtal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""Tagtal Done"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/821512/pictures/full/20130520192649-_.jpg?1369103213"" src="""" style="""" title=""Tagtal Done""/></a></p>
<h3 align=""left""><span>What you see in the pictures or videos are ACTUAL injection samples, NOT PROTOTYPES made from 3D printers.</span></h3>
<p align=""left"">We designed and built 8 versions of PCB, software running in tStylus. OSP SDK for iOS, OSP Web App for Chrome (Windows and Mac OSX), Apps of Tagtal Paper, Tagtal Album...</p>
<p align=""left"">And we even shoot and edited the pictures and videos by ourselves (btw, HD video editing is really a tough and 'impossible' job for my 13"" MacBook Pro, but I still made it with couple of weeks).</p>
<h2 align=""left"">How to use the money raised on Indiegogo</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pay moldings of the parts</li>
<li>Design and make package boxes</li>
<li>FCC, CE certificats</li>
<li>Purchase components for mass-production</li>
<li>Buy some beers and chips</li>
</ol>
<p align=""left""><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">The Future</strong></p>
<p>We're going to add more sensors into tStylus in next version according the demands from the market in near future. For instance, pressure and color sensor.</p>

For many, many years we can only see, click or touch the visualized data on screen but you can never take it out or drop in data just right on screen. Is that stupid? Kind of. The data is contained in a box with a glass front panel (called as display) the only way to get the data out/in is to press a button to “send or receive” it from one place to another. It is kind of ridiculous and maybe the largest legacy technology surviving right under our eyes everyday but ignoring by us for so long. 
Why do not we just pick up a piece of data, pictures, text, videos, colors, links right from the surface of screen and drop it onto another screen? That is simple, intuitive and elegant way to engage the data around us. Hard to say we didn't even think about it but all in Sci-Fi stories.
Guys, it is 2013, that can not stay in Sci-Fi anymore. We are exciting to announce that you can do that with Tagtal tStylus powered by OSP (On-Screen Port) now. And, OSP SDK is going to be open for all developers. 
This is NOT just another stylus but an innovation of human computer interaction. It is also our dream, a dream to have ability to pick, hold, and drop digital data as real matters, a dream we have imagined, novelized, filmed and posted for years.
Now it is going to be true with your support financially and mentally.If the goal is reached not only we give birth to tStylus but also breakout the jail of data and the ceiling above our imagination.

Desire This Tagtal tStylus Digital Dropper

 
Tagtal tStylus
tStylus is a connector of digital and physic world. With tStylus, you pick up everything you see or draw on the screen and drop down it to anywhere you point on screen just in one movement with no pairing at all. And surely, no shouting, shaking or bumping any more. 

The industry design is extremely simple and elegant. Not a single button on the body of tStylus except the power button at rear.No need to press any button to switch among send, receive or other operations, all need to do is just touch the OSP with the tip of tStylus. The process of sending, receiving etc. will be conducted as intended and designed. 
With tStylus You Can

Draw with any other drawing apps on iPad (no surprise)
Pick up data from computer, tablet, smart phone
Hold it and have a go
Drop down data on tablet, smart phone 

Example App: A jewelry designer(up half) and a student(bottom half) are using tStylus with Tagtal Paper
 
 
Tagtal Paper

Tagtal Paper is a notebook application powered by OSP that can give you intuitive way to sketch your and share your ideas with your finger or tStylus. tStylus works as a chemical dropper to Pick Up and Drop the content displayed on different screens which are running Tagtal Paper, it makes you share information freely.
Without tStylus, Tagtal Paper is simply a normal notebook application, just let it record your great ideas. You can free up your mind on Tagtal Paper, drawing, editing and sharing. 

Tagtal Paper 1.0 is already available on App Store!  Free Download Today! The update is on the way to send AppStore for reviewing with more great features.
Compatible with iPad 2, iPad 3, New iPad, iPad Mini.
 
Tagtal Album
Tagtal Album is a picture viewing and sharing application powered by OSP.
You can access the albums and pictures of your Facebook/ Flickr /Picasa/ Instgram... or capture the wonderful moment whenever you want by launch camera in Tagtal Album. Most important is that you can pick up or drop down content in Tagtal Album.
Tagtal Album is under the review of AppStore and will be available on App Store soon.
Compatible with iPhone4, iPhone4S, iPod Touch.
 
Potential Apps 
OSP SDK is going to open to developers, that can be used to create more and more apps or integrated with existing apps (we are approaching more 3rd part app developers to empower more apps to support OSP). 
On Screen ID for Online Pay
You can also lock or unlock your private information with tStylus securely. You just simply use your tStylus to touch the locked content or login zone on the screen to access securely. The device will check the identity of your tStylus to make sure you have authority to copy or access the content. You do not have to entering your password to login. What you need to do is just keep your tStylus safe, as like a touch key. And all this identity check can be done without user’s interfering at all. We call it capacitive fingerprints of your tStylus. That makes human computer interaction is even more fluent and secure.

Open OSP API for Developers
We are going to make OSP API open for all developers. So once you get tStylus you can also create your own Apps or add unique features to your existing Apps with OSP API easily. The first preview of OSP SDK is going to open in September, 2013.
 

What We already Done and Where We Will Go

The team already spent a year to do some research and prototype tStylus. The first working prototype is built in 2012 coded as MARK. Since it is such an inspiring capacitive stylus in this world ever there is no clues at all in our way to make it real in the very beginning. In last 12 months, we overcame a lot of challenges or even difficulties and found a way out from darkness to turn the idea into a product.
What you see in the pictures or videos are ACTUAL injection samples, NOT PROTOTYPES made from 3D printers.
We designed and built 8 versions of PCB, software running in tStylus. OSP SDK for iOS, OSP Web App for Chrome (Windows and Mac OSX), Apps of Tagtal Paper, Tagtal Album...
And we even shoot and edited the pictures and videos by ourselves (btw, HD video editing is really a tough and 'impossible' job for my 13"" MacBook Pro, but I still made it with couple of weeks).
How to use the money raised on Indiegogo

Pay moldings of the parts
Design and make package boxes
FCC, CE certificats
Purchase components for mass-production
Buy some beers and chips

The Future
We're going to add more sensors into tStylus in next version according the demands from the market in near future. For instance, pressure and color sensor.
And we are also planning lots of great features which can not be disclosed yet.
Further more, OSP as a data communication channel can be used in vary situations along with other kind of hardware, e.g. gloves, toy cars which communicates with computers, tablets or phones, or more straight, screens. We just take tStylus as a beginning. What in our pipeline for next are even more incredible cool gears powered by OSP and you will be keep posted down the road.

Once your phone is fully charged the electric supply stops going to the phone and is redirected to the power bank. This preserves your battery life and keeps your phone from draining even faster over time.PRSRV also has an ejectable credit card shaped battery that can be used away from the main power bank. This means you can take PRSRV where ever you go.PRSRV is first power bank in the world that can be used in two different locations at the same time.Do you charge your phone overnight?Busy schedules force us to charge overnight, in turn causing damage to the battery and wasting electricity. Our current chargers are inefficiently charging our phones. The most efficient way to charge your phone is to unplug it when it is fully charged. The other way is using PRSRV.Apple and Samsung both recommend taking off your phone cases while charging your phone – a highly inconvenient practice. The phone cases restrict the flow of heat and cause even more inefficiencies. PRSRV prevents overheating issues but redirecting electricity.PRSRV stores surplus electricity for use later on. No other product effectively handles the problem of electric leakage while a mobile remains plugged in. Did you know?Energy efficiency must be both large and small scale to overcome the biggest problem of our generation, the energy crisis.Portability of PRSRV's removable battery:If you are traveling and need lots of extra charge you can take the entire power bank with you, or, on a regular day you can eject the smaller, credit card shaped battery and carry it in your wallet.and use it conveniently when you need to.This feature makes PRSRV the first power bank in the world that can be used in two different locations at the same time. The removable battery can be used on its own, you can share the power bank with friends and family.These days people carry way too many things, power banks and a bunch of wires...PRSRV is simple....1) You simply connect your phone through the USB cable into PRSRV.2) PRSRV sits between your phone and the power source.PRSRV does the rest...

<h3><strong><span>Update - September 14th</span></strong></h3>
<p>We added a video demo of the product under the Gallery tab.</p>
<h2><strong><span>Introduction</span></strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the Emoticon Toy is going to change the way people communicate thru social media by allowing them to send personalized animated emoticon messages.  It will be a new way to send a heartfelt message to your sweetie, an apology to a friend, a note of encouragement to a classmate and so many other things.  We are so close to releasing this fun tool on Facebook, but we need your help to add the finishing touches.<br/><br/>With the development of Double Barrel Digital’s tool, Xpress, we are able to create rapid lip sync animation in any language with unlimited expressions and emotions so much quicker than was ever possible before.  However, due to limitations with our current funding we were only able to build and animate a small number of messages at this time.  We are looking for $11K to complete and launch the tool, and add to our collection of messages so that there’s a message for everyone.  </p>
<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are a game/application developer and an artist/animator with 30 years experience developing games, animation and applications.</p>
<h3>John Molinari, Lead Software Engineer</h3>
<p>John started working in computer graphics in 1989, at Time Arts, Inc., in Santa Rosa, CA and since then has worked on Lego Land, EA Sports Madden Football and Disney games. John's experience in this space is vast and includes working as a web developer, web designer, QA manager, animator, artist, producer and director.</p>
<h3>Tom McKeon, Lead Creative Director</h3>
<p>Tom studied painting and photography at the School of The Art Institute of Chicago, and film making at Columbia College of Chicago. He has worked in advertising at Leo Burnett and on projects for clients like McDonalds, Nintendo, Samsonite, United and Heinz. He has won awards for his work as an Animator / Director / Web Designer / and Fine Digital Painter.</p>
<p>Both Tom and John have extensive experience in storytelling and digital technology production. Our talents led us to develop a groundbreaking new way of distributing digital media in a social animated app called the Emoticon Toy.</p>
<h2><strong><span>How did we create the The Emoticon Toy?<br/></span></strong></h2>
<p><span>We believe that animation should be built by animators, not programmers.</span></p>
<p><span>How can an animated messaging and storytelling product be used in a social environment without an animator? It can't. Programmers can't make quality animation; you need custom animation which takes a long time.</span></p>
<p><span>How can a small company generate the enormous custom animation needed to make an animated consumer messaging product with a limited budget? It can't. Unless, it has an unfair advantage; meet Double Barrel Digital Xpress. You can check it out here:<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span></span></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.doublebarreldigital.com/xpress"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><img alt=""Double Barrel Digital's Xpress"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.doublebarreldigital.com/bannerjpegs/336x280.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Double Barrel Digital's Xpress""/></span></a></p>
<p>With the use of our patented product Double Barrel Digital's Xpress, we can now produce fast custom talking animation with full eXPRESSions and emotions.</p>
<p><span>We’ll use Xpress often to generate new extensions for the Emoticon Toy.  Extensions will include fun new characters and voices relevant to current events, sports, politics, entertainment and other things.</span></p>
<p><span>It takes about 2 days for an artist to draw an Xpress Character in Adobe Flash Professional. With Xpress, we can create about 800 phrases a week with one animator.  We believe we have a new product model that can be used to distribute new media which combines the entertaining value of a game and the social engagement necessary in today’s market.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Consumers and professionals of all ages will love using the Emoticon Toy and will return every week to see what's new.</span></p>
<h2><span>How will we use the funds?<br/></span></h2>
<p><span>We will use the funds to finish the basic emoticon character to add a lot more animations. We want the character to say everything that a user would potentially want to tell another user; from greetings, to invitations, to happy birthday messages.  We also plan to target specific genres like music, sports, romance and politics.</span></p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, the extra money we raise will be spent on hiring voice over talent, artists, and animators to create additional characters and we’ll extend the tool to port to new devices.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the potential impact of this tool?<br/></strong></h2>
<p>The Emoticon Toy, supported by Xpress production, is a breakthrough in 2D animation due to its production speed and delivery medium. Our technology will advance the quality of 2D animation for messaging and provide a fun and engaging way to communicate your message to your friends, family, colleagues, customers and the community. The Emoticon Toy is easy enough for your child to enjoy and powerful enough for professionals to use in social campaigns.  It will give you the cool and powerful impact you need to get your message across.

We added a video demo of the product under the Gallery tab.
Introduction
We believe that the Emoticon Toy is going to change the way people communicate thru social media by allowing them to send personalized animated emoticon messages.  It will be a new way to send a heartfelt message to your sweetie, an apology to a friend, a note of encouragement to a classmate and so many other things.  We are so close to releasing this fun tool on Facebook, but we need your help to add the finishing touches.With the development of Double Barrel Digital’s tool, Xpress, we are able to create rapid lip sync animation in any language with unlimited expressions and emotions so much quicker than was ever possible before.  However, due to limitations with our current funding we were only able to build and animate a small number of messages at this time.  We are looking for $11K to complete and launch the tool, and add to our collection of messages so that there’s a message for everyone.  
Who are we?
We are a game/application developer and an artist/animator with 30 years experience developing games, animation and applications.
John Molinari, Lead Software Engineer
John started working in computer graphics in 1989, at Time Arts, Inc., in Santa Rosa, CA and since then has worked on Lego Land, EA Sports Madden Football and Disney games. John's experience in this space is vast and includes working as a web developer, web designer, QA manager, animator, artist, producer and director.
Tom McKeon, Lead Creative Director
Tom studied painting and photography at the School of The Art Institute of Chicago, and film making at Columbia College of Chicago. He has worked in advertising at Leo Burnett and on projects for clients like McDonalds, Nintendo, Samsonite, United and Heinz. He has won awards for his work as an Animator / Director / Web Designer / and Fine Digital Painter.
Both Tom and John have extensive experience in storytelling and digital technology production. Our talents led us to develop a groundbreaking new way of distributing digital media in a social animated app called the Emoticon Toy.
How did we create the The Emoticon Toy?
We believe that animation should be built by animators, not programmers.
How can an animated messaging and storytelling product be used in a social environment without an animator? It can't. Programmers can't make quality animation; you need custom animation which takes a long time.
How can a small company generate the enormous custom animation needed to make an animated consumer messaging product with a limited budget? It can't. Unless, it has an unfair advantage; meet Double Barrel Digital Xpress. You can check it out here: 

With the use of our patented product Double Barrel Digital's Xpress, we can now produce fast custom talking animation with full eXPRESSions and emotions.
We’ll use Xpress often to generate new extensions for the Emoticon Toy.  Extensions will include fun new characters and voices relevant to current events, sports, politics, entertainment and other things.
It takes about 2 days for an artist to draw an Xpress Character in Adobe Flash Professional. With Xpress, we can create about 800 phrases a week with one animator.  We believe we have a new product model that can be used to distribute new media which combines the entertaining value of a game and the social engagement necessary in today’s market.
Consumers and professionals of all ages will love using the Emoticon Toy and will return every week to see what's new.
How will we use the funds?
We will use the funds to finish the basic emoticon character to add a lot more animations. We want the character to say everything that a user would potentially want to tell another user; from greetings, to invitations, to happy birthday messages.  We also plan to target specific genres like music, sports, romance and politics.
If we exceed our goal, the extra money we raise will be spent on hiring voice over talent, artists, and animators to create additional characters and we’ll extend the tool to port to new devices.
What is the potential impact of this tool?
The Emoticon Toy, supported by Xpress production, is a breakthrough in 2D animation due to its production speed and delivery medium. Our technology will advance the quality of 2D animation for messaging and provide a fun and engaging way to communicate your message to your friends, family, colleagues, customers and the community. The Emoticon Toy is easy enough for your child to enjoy and powerful enough for professionals to use in social campaigns.  It will give you the cool and powerful impact you need to get your message across. With your help, we can make history!

It controls outlet adapters and bulb sockets connected to the Hook. It monitors the state of appliances and lights connected to the outlet adapters and bulb sockets even when you don't use the app to control them. You can still use the remote to control. The app makes it easier to remember your devices by allowing you to name them. It also enables simple rule-based scenarios through IFTTT (now IF).

<h3><b>FAQs</b></h3>
</div><div>
<b></b><p></p>
<p><b>1.
How many devices can I connect to one Hook?</b></p>
<p>We
have tested with 15 devices without interference causing a problem. We believe
you can do more depending on your surroundings and ambiance.</p>
<p><b>2. What RF frequencies does Hook support?</b></p>
<p>315 MHz and 433 MHz</p>
<p><b>3. What
other RF devices does Hook work with?</b></p>
<p>Hook
works with any RF remote that has static codes. Some examples include motorized
window blinds*, LED strip controllers, ceiling fans, wireless door chimes and
some garage door openers. Pretty much any remote that doesn't have the
""eye"" at the front, as in IR. Of course, Hook will work with your
existing remote-controlled outlets and bulb sockets. Hook does not work with
Hampton Bay ceiling fans yet.</p>
<p><b>4. Do these bulb sockets support dimming?</b></p>
<p>No,
this model is just on/off.</p>
<p><b>5. Why can't people from the EU buy the kit
options?</b></p>
<p>Homes
in the EU operate with different plugs and voltages than North America. RF
remote-controlled outlets and socket adapters are available and work with Hook,
but not through our collaborators on this campaign. Feel free to buy a Hook and
purchase RF devices separately!</p>
<p><b>6. I have a big house, do I need more than one
Hook?</b></p>
<p>No!
We have tested it on a Multi-Storied 2000 SqFt house and we were able to
control all the outlets and sockets with just one Hook. You are always welcome
to buy more Hooks and give them to your friends and family or put them in your
vacation home (not from personal experience btw, must be nice!).</p>
<p><b>7. I already have a home automation product like
NEST, SmartThings, NEEO. How will the Hook work with them?</b></p>
<p>IFTTT
makes Hook talk to all the awesome smart home products out there</p>
<p><b>8. Why does Hook have a USB plug?</b></p>
<p>Hook
receives its power by USB. We chose USB (as opposed to a built-in outlet plug)
to keep costs down and allow easy access for tinkerers. You can use a standard
USB adapter you have around the house or get one from us with Hook</p>
<p><b>9. I don't see an option to purchase a USB
adapter. How do I get one with my Hook?</b></p>
<p>Just
add $5 to your pledge amount and we'll ship a USB adapter with your Hook.</p>
<p><b>10. Does Hook only work with these particular
brands of outlet adapter and bulb socket?</b></p>
<p>No.
Hook works with almost every remote controlled outlet adapters and bulb sockets
that are out there.</p>
<p><b>11. I don't have a smartphone, would the Hook
work for me?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
we have you covered. The Hook can be controlled with a Web App as well.</p>
<b></b><p><b>12. Did you use a green screen for the Machu Picchu shot?</b></p>
<p>No, Robert was really there! We wouldn't deceive you like that ;-)</p>

Press mentions!Well, there is not much to talk about. Current solutions are both crazy expensive and difficult to setup. That's why we created Hook! What is Hook?Hook is a new device that makes inexpensive remote-controlled outlet adapters and bulb sockets Smart - to enable Home Automation on a Budget.These remote-controlled outlet adapters and bulb sockets are already commercially available. You can buy them from Amazon, Costco and Home Depot. They come with a remote control. An appliance plugged into the outlet adapter or a bulb screwed into the socket can be turned on/off with press of the button on the remote. They are really inexpensive - often as low as $5/ea in pack of five. They are not line-of-sight and work through walls. Hook makes these outlets adapters and bulb sockets Smart. All you have to do is clone the remote control to the Hook app (see setup video). It's fun and one-time! And the best part, you only need one Hook for your home. Existing appliances and lighting in the home like lamps, light bulbs, coffeemaker, window fan - anything that is powered by electricity - can now be controlled with your phone from anywhere in the world.Hook works with IFTTT (via Particle channel). You can schedule operations of routine tasks like operating holiday lights between sunset and sunrise and create rule-based scenarios like turning your coffee maker 'on' when the alarm goes off.Lastly, some technical bit. Hook is a RF-to-WiFi hub with remote cloning technology built-in. It works over 315MHz and 433MHz RF frequency bands. Devices like remote controlled outlet adapters, bulb sockets, LED strip controllers, ceiling fan remotes, motorized blinds, window fans and space heaters work on the same frequency. WiFi chip in Hook is supplied by particle.io - this is the reason Hook  is easy to use and incredibly reliable!Outlet adapters or Bulb Sockets - What to get? For anything you will plug in to an electrical outlet get an outlet adapter. For lamps, get outlet adapters. Bulb sockets work best with ceiling lights. Hook does not ship with a USB wall adapter. You can use ANY standard wall charger like an old iPhone charger to power Hook. Or get one from us that's guaranteed to work with Hook! Just add $5 to your pledge.  Why USB? USB helped us keep costs down while allowing tinkerer in you to get access to Hook's core.Remote controls? Yes, kits come with the original remote control(s) for times when you pressing the button is far more satisfying that tap on your phone.If you pledge for one of the kits, you have two options to get part of your perk:  Get the outlets and sockets early (Aug '15).Get started with home automation sooner and do the pairing yourself with Hook when it ships (it's simple, fun, and one-time). Hook will still arrive around Dec. '15.Get everything pre-programmed with Hook (Dec. '15). The outlets and bulb sockets come pre-programmed and ready to go with your Hook.You don't have to decide now. We will get your preference in the survey sent out after the campaign ends.
1. Connect Hook to a USB power source - an old iPhone USB adapter will do.
2. Connect lamps and appliances to outlet adapters, and light bulbs to bulb sockets.
3. Pair the remote(s) - Skip this step if you are getting them pre-programmed.
4. Enjoy the benefits of a smart home! 
The Hook app will be available for iOS and Android when the Hook ships. It controls outlet adapters and bulb sockets connected to the Hook. It monitors the state of appliances and lights connected to the outlet adapters and bulb sockets even when you don't use the app to control them. You can still use the remote to control. The app makes it easier to remember your devices by allowing you to name them. It also enables simple rule-based scenarios through IFTTT (now IF). Hook app will also have machine learning built-in so that it can learn to serve you better. For example, it can notify you if you accidentally leave an appliance On, like a space heater or curling iron. When you get more outlet adapters and bulb sockets, the app allows you to clone the new remote to your phone.Imagine a cold winter night. You are all cozy in your bed.

 for short. It is based on the eMaker Huxley of our last campaign, but with a considerable number of design improvements.  The machine uses a 
process known a <i>fused filament fabrication</i>, which it employs to build three 
dimensional objects in a range of plastics and in a variety of colours.  This process enables the user to create almost any shape 
which can be modelled on a computer, including some which could not be 
produced by traditional manufacturing techniques at all. Many 
examples of the objects people have made with this and similar machines can be

<div style=""""><br/></div>
<div style="""">The RepRapPro Huxley is one of the smallest 3D printers 
available at the moment in terms of footprint, but not in terms of build 
volume. Its primary design goals were to offer a printer which was small
 enough to be portable, fast to replicate, and fast to assemble and 
to commission.  The great thing about these machines being self-replicating is 
that they can also print upgrades and replacement parts for themselves.</div>
<div style=""""><br/></div>
<div style="""">The machines have been put through thousands of hours of 
printing, with a variety of materials, and the design refined to end up 
with a thoroughly robust and high-quality 3D printer. Examples 
of parts printed with these machines can be found on our <a href=""http://www.emakershop.com/blog/?p=364"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""eMAKERshop blog showing examples of the eMAKER Huxley's capabilities"">eMaker blog</a>, showing the range of features which can be produced, as well as the consistently high print quality which can be achieved.</div>
<div style=""""><br/></div>
<div style="""">We fully understand that merely assembling a 3D printer 
will not guarantee good prints, so we are also offering backers all the 
software and knowhow to produce high-quality parts. As well as access to

</div><br/></div>","RepRapPro - a collaboration between eMaker Ltd and RepRap Ltd - is running the new RepRap Huxley 3D-printer campaign for Christmas.


The RepRapPro Huxley

The RepRapPro Huxley 3D printer is a Replicating Rapid prototyping machine, or RepRap
 for short. It is based on the eMaker Huxley of our last campaign, but with a considerable number of design improvements.  The machine uses a 
process known a fused filament fabrication, which it employs to build three 
dimensional objects in a range of plastics and in a variety of colours.  This process enables the user to create almost any shape 
which can be modelled on a computer, including some which could not be 
produced by traditional manufacturing techniques at all. Many 
examples of the objects people have made with this and similar machines can be 
found on thingiverse.

The RepRapPro Huxley is one of the smallest 3D printers 
available at the moment in terms of footprint, but not in terms of build 
volume. Its primary design goals were to offer a printer which was small
 enough to be portable, fast to replicate, and fast to assemble and 
to commission.  The great thing about these machines being self-replicating is 
that they can also print upgrades and replacement parts for themselves.

The machines have been put through thousands of hours of 
printing, with a variety of materials, and the design refined to end up 
with a thoroughly robust and high-quality 3D printer. Examples 
of parts printed with these machines can be found on our eMaker blog, showing the range of features which can be produced, as well as the consistently high print quality which can be achieved.

We fully understand that merely assembling a 3D printer 
will not guarantee good prints, so we are also offering backers all the 
software and knowhow to produce high-quality parts. As well as access to
 online support, all of this information will be made available to 
backers on our website.

You can see the RepRapPro Huxley in action on eMaker's Youtube channel here.

We also have an active development plan for the RepRapPro 
Huxley 3D printer, so users will also have access to software updates 
and designs for upgraded parts which they can print themselves.



Machine specifications:   - Build volume: 140x140x110mm   - Overall size: 260x280x280mm   - Printing materials: ABS, PLA, 1.75mm diameter thermoplastic.   - Build surface: PCB-heated bed to ensure parts do not warp.   - Accuracy: 0.1mm   - Resolution: 0.0125mm   - Building speed: 1,800 mm/min   - Moving speed: 12,000 mm/min   - Deposition rate: 33 cm3 / hr   - Motion: Linear ball bearings on X and Y axes, Igus low friction bushings on Z axis.   - Fully pre-soldered electronics with built-in microSD card slot for standalone printing.   - Universal power supply; works with all mains voltages.   - Enhancements to the printed parts to improve the ease of assembly of the X and Y axes





Sources of plastic filament:


You will get 100m of white 1.75mm PLA filament included with your RepRapPro Huxley kit, which is more than enough to make all the 3D-printed parts for another complete Huxley.

<p>This application will go hand in hand with the studies that have come out about how simply taking a picture of what you are eating will make a difference in your overall diet. It was found that taking pictures is the best way to do this because of the speed at which you can record and the visual aspect of seeing what you are about to put in your body. Compare this to the time it would take to calculate calories! With this application you will be able to take a picture of your food and add some optional notes.

<p>The feature that I am most excited about is the cheat day feature. This will let you write down and take pictures of any cravings that you may encounter. This will get you to address the craving and even remind yourself when your cheat day finally arrives to eat what you were craving during the week. The idea behind the cheat day is once a week you eat whatever you like. This can mean anything from greasy burgers to a gallon of cookie dough (ok don’t go overboard). The point is when you eat these types of foods it will actually speed up your metabolism and allow you to more efficiently use the good foods you are eating in the next days.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>If you're used to thinking different, then you'll love the XTRUCASE Axis for the iPhone 5. When we started designing it, we wanted to make a case that not only matched Apple's gorgeous design aesthetic, but also protected your investment while granting you the ability to customize as much (or as little) as you want, in a way that's simple and fast.</p>
<p>The Axis case is a hybrid, with the mainframe <a href=""http://youtu.be/_tlE_W4n1ig"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CNC machined</a> from aircraft grade aluminum, while the high impact poly carbonate core preserves and protects reception.  But most importantly, the unique design allows you to add Major Attachments (on the back) and up to four Micro Attachments (on the corners).</p>
<p>Help us bring the Axis to market, and you'll be rewarded not only with the first batch of Axis cases (and optionally our first two Micro Attachments, an USB flash drive and a stylus/pen combo), but also our undying gratitude, plus the intangible and invaluable joy that comes from being a patron of new and exciting developments in lifestyle technology.</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are Ben, Daisy, Enoch, Gabe, Jeff, Rich, and Tim -- the team behind the <a href=""http://iphonecasealuminum.com/in-the-press/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">critically acclaimed</a> all-aluminum bumper case for the iPhone 4/4S. We made three models for the 4/4S:</p>
<p>SLIDER (<a href=""http://youtu.be/mNfRpKFUVPs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://youtu.be/mNfRpKFUVPs</a>)<br/>DUO (<a href=""http://youtu.be/cKIOTlGTc2c"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://youtu.be/cKIOTlGTc2c</a>)<br/>CRYSTALLINE (<a href=""http://youtu.be/ys9PdMs4PL4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://youtu.be/ys9PdMs4PL4</a>)</p>
<p>Now, we're ready to give iPhone 5 owners the same easy slide-on/slide-off functionality.  </p>
<p>Existing aluminum iPhone 5 cases all require screws, wrenches, or other tools to install and uninstall.  Our Axis case is different: it features our patent-pending slider frame technology, so getting it on and off your iPhone 5 is a breeze.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $35k to start producing the Axis line of iPhone 5 cases.</p>
<a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/249858/pledges/new"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i46.tinypic.com/qpmfl5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a>

""XTRUCASE make some great aluminum cases for the iPhone 4/4S and if you like there line of cases you love the Axis.""
""I am absolutely amazed at what you've guys has brought to the table. The case is definitely a game changer. Really love how it has some of the every day things we use in a business type environment.""

SCROLL DOWN FOR MORE PHOTOS! =)

Short Summary
If you're used to thinking different, then you'll love the XTRUCASE Axis for the iPhone 5. When we started designing it, we wanted to make a case that not only matched Apple's gorgeous design aesthetic, but also protected your investment while granting you the ability to customize as much (or as little) as you want, in a way that's simple and fast.
The Axis case is a hybrid, with the mainframe CNC machined from aircraft grade aluminum, while the high impact poly carbonate core preserves and protects reception.  But most importantly, the unique design allows you to add Major Attachments (on the back) and up to four Micro Attachments (on the corners).
Help us bring the Axis to market, and you'll be rewarded not only with the first batch of Axis cases (and optionally our first two Micro Attachments, an USB flash drive and a stylus/pen combo), but also our undying gratitude, plus the intangible and invaluable joy that comes from being a patron of new and exciting developments in lifestyle technology.
Who We Are
We are Ben, Daisy, Enoch, Gabe, Jeff, Rich, and Tim -- the team behind the critically acclaimed all-aluminum bumper case for the iPhone 4/4S. We made three models for the 4/4S:
SLIDER (http://youtu.be/mNfRpKFUVPs)DUO (http://youtu.be/cKIOTlGTc2c)CRYSTALLINE (http://youtu.be/ys9PdMs4PL4)
Now, we're ready to give iPhone 5 owners the same easy slide-on/slide-off functionality.  
Existing aluminum iPhone 5 cases all require screws, wrenches, or other tools to install and uninstall.  Our Axis case is different: it features our patent-pending slider frame technology, so getting it on and off your iPhone 5 is a breeze.


What We Need & What You Get
We need $35k to start producing the Axis line of iPhone 5 cases.


We've done this before with our iPhone 4/4S cases, so we know exactly what the production schedule looks like.  Once funding is complete, this is what happens:
Days 1-40: make the plastic injection molds and ensure that the fit is perfectDays 41-80: manufacture the poly carbonate and aircraft grade aluminum componentsDays 81-90: ship it to you!(note that we are shipping this first batch without retail packaging to save you money and get you the products faster)
The case is 66.5mm W x 131.5mm L x 12.3mm H, and weighs a mere 24.8g. As a contributor, you get your choice of colors when we ship:

Slate & Blue
Slate & Red
Silver & Blue
Silver & Red

This means that wherever you have an internet connection, you and your advisor has access to your accounts. There's no ball and chain quite like having to only work from your desk. With Xero however, it doesn't matter if you want to access your accounts from the office or from home in your pyjamas. You can work on your accounts at a time that suits you!Xero's popularity is increasing daily. So is the momentum of the hundreds of thousands of small business owners across the globe that are using Xero in their businesses. With in excess of 250,000 paying users and over 9,000 partners (accountants, bookkeepers, advisors, add-ons) it is clear that Xero is rapidly gaining market share and a radical following.There’s a wealth of information out there, including hundreds of blogs, forums and also the recently launched Xero TV and Xero University. But we realised as Xero users that we haven’t always got the time to go and search and look at all of those resources.What we want to do, is to bring together the very best information and articles into one magazine, along with exclusive articles, to save Xero users hours of time from searching on the internet.XU Magazine is the independent magazine run by Xero users, for Xero users. The magazine is aimed at the ever growing 250,000+ strong community of Xero users and will be delivered worldwide in print.There's something for everyone:Its quality glossy format will captivate readers and keep them turning the page. Initially, XU Magazine will be printed quarterly and delivered straight to the office or homes of its readers. The magazine will initially have 52 full colour A4 (21 x 29.7cm / 8.3 x 11.7 inches) pages.Do more than you thought possibleUseful content you can expect from the magazine includes:

Feature Articles. XU Magazine's feature length articles are thoughtful, insightful, educational and informative. They will cover a wide range of topics that will provoke readers to explore the Xero accounting system and add-ons in greater depth.

Tutorials. Exploring not only the basics but also advanced subjects. We focus on not only what can be done, but also how it's done. Tutorials are written in simple to follow steps and in plain English to appeal to all Xero users. 

Letters/Emails to the Editor. Something to say? Something to share? Then we actively encourage you to get in touch.

Reviews. Independently reviewing Xero approved add-ons and other 3rd party software applications.

Interviews. Each issue we will feature an in depth interview with a senior figure from one of the Xero approved add-ons or 3rd party applications. We will explore their vision, how their software assists Xero users and what their strategies are for the coming year.

Short news. Our short news section is intended to bring attention to interesting developments that are of interest to the Xero user community and to connect people to interesting new resources, information and insight that may not warrant an entire regular article.

Sounding board. We pick a topic and invite both Xero users and industry experts to share what they have they say.

One for the Devs. Code snippets, tips, tricks and how-tos.

Diary/What's on. Seminars, webinars, Xero events and much more.

Case Studies. A chance for add-on partners to submit how they've assisted a Xero user's business after they've implemented/integrated their software. We also seek out unique and unusual case-studies where the Xero accounting system has been adopted.

Add-ons. What's new? What's popular? 

Add-ons in Beta. Be one of the first to know and get exclusive invites to new add-ons still in private beta.

Mystery 'shopper'. We will pick up to three add-ons in the market, subscribe to their service, implement their offering and request support and advice. Each recipient of our mystery 'shop' will be marked on a series of criteria and given a score. We will be looking at friendliness as well as technical knowledge and suitability to our imaginary business.

Gadgets/Accessories. We all love gadgets! What better than to discover the latest and greatest gadgets out there that will not only keep you connected with colleagues and friends but aid you in the workplace too!
You bet! We have some fantastic stretch goals in mind, including doubling the page count and increasing the publication to bi-monthly. When announced, any existing supporters backing us on a subscription level pledge will automatically have their subscription increased to 6 issues per year instead of 4 - FREE of charge.But that's not all! We'd also like to create a fully interactive iPad version with bonus content including great videos, audio snippets, podcasts and live link-ups with the authors so you can ask away with questions and get additional support and advice. The Indiegogo community meets the Xero community We recognise that Indiegogo hosts an important community: innovators, early adopters and the intellectually curious. The thriving, 250,000+ strong Xero community are likeminded.If you share the same passion and believe we're onto something, then please get involved...We're reaching out to fellow Xero Users. We have a lot of planning and ideas in place but need the support of the Xero user community to make this a reality.We need your pledges, but as importantly, we need your support in many different areas...Our ambassadors play a vital role. They're our eyes and ears in their respective countries and offer a convenient way for readers to get in touch.Heather Smith, Ambassador for AustraliaRecently, we were extremely fortunate to meet-up with Heather Smith whilst she was here in the UK on holiday. With only a matter of 24 hours to go before she had to catch her flight back to Australia, we were able to share this project with her over coffee. Heather is a writer, speaker, Xero Certified Advisor and author of Xero for Dummies (amongst other titles in the Xero for Dummies series of books). Heather is extremely passionate about Xero and helps small businesses in a wide range of industries with Xero set-up, migration, training and on-going support. We're pleased to announce that Heather is XU Magazine's first Representative and Country Ambassador for Australia.Gayle Buchanan, Ambassador for New ZealandFor many Xero users, Gayle requires very little by way of an introduction as she is very active in the Xero Community Forums. Gayle is the founder of Number Nurses. Number Nurses are cloud integrators, who specialise in helping business owners and accountants master cloud applications like Xero, Xero Add-ons and the Google suite.Kirsten Barrie, Ambassador for the USAKirsten is a Xero Certified Financial Advisor with over 10 years experience (CFO, Accounting Manager). Certified in a dozen+ of Xero's add-ons, she and her team are expertly able to integrate them with Xero. She lives in San Francisco with her extra-large husky, Bella, and is the Chief Cloud Integrator & Owner of Verte Consulting.Jonathan Gaunt, Ambassador for the UKHaving spent the majority of his career in 'big' businesses, Jonathan now works as an advisor to ambitious small businesses in the creative and tech sector and is a massive fan (and certified partner) of Xero. He's a lover of tech and great design, and he knows a thing or two about Xero add-ons! Jonathan is based in Bristol, UK and is the founder of FD Works.We're listening and open to suggestions - If you'd like to contribute or have a particular skill-set (writer, journalist, photographer, graphic designer, illustrator, ninja programmer, expert developer) that may be of interest to XU Magazine, then please do not hesitate to get in touch.TOGETHER we can make this magazine a reality.

I came up with the idea for FlyGrip after noticing how frustrating it was to rely on both hands when texting, surfing the web, or composing an email. With FlyGrip, you don't have to worry about misclicking, fumbling, dropping your phone, and compromised reception due to the ""death grip"" issue. When not in use, FlyGrip snaps into place and takes up only a ¼” on your phone or case, so your device can still fit in your pocket or purse. FlyGrip was engineered in response to the inherent difficulties with holding and navigating touchscreens with one hand.</span><br/></p>

The spring loaded top and versatile low profile design allows for a secure and comfortable grip which provides a full range of motion for the thumb to navigate the entire display, even on the really large touch screens, and completely frees up one hand. As an additional feature, FlyGrip also doubles as a kickstand for both landscape and portrait views.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 16px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 22px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); border-collapse: separate;"">Once you have used a FlyGrip on your device, you will immediately notice how ""right"" it feels in your hand. Along with the added comfortable and navigation benefits, you will notice how it allows you to perform what I call ""real-life multitasking"" to save you time through your day.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
FlyGrip is an accessory that enables you to use your smartphone one-handed. I came up with the idea for FlyGrip after noticing how frustrating it was to rely on both hands when texting, surfing the web, or composing an email. With FlyGrip, you don't have to worry about misclicking, fumbling, dropping your phone, and compromised reception due to the ""death grip"" issue. When not in use, FlyGrip snaps into place and takes up only a ¼” on your phone or case, so your device can still fit in your pocket or purse. FlyGrip was engineered in response to the inherent difficulties with holding and navigating touchscreens with one hand.













Why FlyGrip?

FlyGrip is ergonomically designed to fit comfortably around your fingers. The spring loaded top and versatile low profile design allows for a secure and comfortable grip which provides a full range of motion for the thumb to navigate the entire display, even on the really large touch screens, and completely frees up one hand. As an additional feature, FlyGrip also doubles as a kickstand for both landscape and portrait views.
Once you have used a FlyGrip on your device, you will immediately notice how ""right"" it feels in your hand. Along with the added comfortable and navigation benefits, you will notice how it allows you to perform what I call ""real-life multitasking"" to save you time through your day.







Create  Your Own FlyGrip!
FlyGrip is a customizable piece of artwork. Just because technology is functional doesn't mean our devices can't be art. Just select your design and the body color of your FlyGrip. FlyGrip is your own personal canvas, and the beauty is in your design.

How to Apply FlyGrip





Clean Surface. Using an isopropyl alcohol wipe, clean phone/case surface and let dry. Do not use household cleaners. 


Apply FlyGrip. Remove the adhesive backing and align evenly on the back of your case. We recommend placing FlyGrip on the bottom center of your device, where gripping is most comfortable. 



Press Firmly! Hold in place for 30 seconds and press firmly with both hands. Wait 30 minutes before using. If possible, allow 48 hours before heavy usage for full bonding to occur.



How to Remove FlyGrip





Grab a dull, flat, thin object. Try a butter knife. Slide under your FlyGrip. Slowly and carefully, pry the edges of the FlyGrip up.


Clean Surface. Your FlyGrip adhesive is not secure for reuse. Please remove old adhesive and replace with new.

experienced first-hand the pain of trying to memorize and later recall all our
ideas and thoughts, whether it's a casual thought to buy a milk on the way home tonight or a great idea on how to optimize an algorithm. As well, we wanted to not only remember everything but also make it beneficial. We
tried to use existing solutions, but quickly discovered their functional
limitations and amount of hassle involved when using them regularly. </span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As we
talked with hundreds of people to gather some feedback to our idea, and quickly found
how common this problem is. People of all ages and from all walks of life
confessed to having the same trouble of keeping their thoughts remembered and turning them into actions.</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Inspired by
the desire to make life easier for so many people as well as for ourselves, we
committed to building our own solution. It would be totally simple and easy to
use - just tap and talk - yet be intelligent and endlessly customizable. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">To achieve this goal
we assembled a dynamic and passionate team of scientists, engineers and
entrepreneurs with a formidable intellectual power. We got strong support not
just from families and friends, but also from experienced advisors in the tech
industry. We believe that together we will make MYLE TAP a success. And ultimately will Make Your
Life Easier.</p>

Thank you for all your support and feedback! We couldn't have gotten as far as we have now without our families, friends, backers, mentors, and all the wonderful tech community. We are endlessly grateful and can't wait to bring MYLE TAP to market.</p>

<br/><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Risks and challenges</span></h2>
<br/>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We are
realists and are completely open about the possible obstacles that may delay
your  MYLE TAP delivery. Having
considered all possible risks we are sharing the main ones, so you know what we
are dealing with.</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">
</p>
<p><b>Component supply:</b> MYLE TAP is built
using a significant amount of components coming from multiple global suppliers,
which have different lead times. If any of these suppliers amends or extends
their agreed lead times, this will disturb or delay the entire production
cycle. To prevent this we are actively searching for reserve suppliers for TAP
components.</p>
<p><b>Design changes and enhancements:</b> Once the
production has started, there will be several 
parameters that can be changed or diversified  in order to improve your experience with TAP.
Adding new shell shapes, expanding colour palette, increasing data transfer
speed, etc. Making such enhancements during production can be challenging and
potentially affect deliveries. We try to accomodate such changes in advance to
ensure that TAP ships with superior quality.</p>
<b>Shipping and customs: </b>When shipping starts,
there will always be a risk of the logistical delays caused by freighters,
shipments getting stuck in Customs. It may happen either when we are receiving
the products from the factory, or when shipping them to you. We are working on
building our supply chain as reliable as we can and hope there won't be any
delays.<br/>

<div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">F.A.Q.</span></h2>
<br/>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>About MYLE</b></h3>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Why should I care about instantly capturing my thoughts? </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Because it’s so easy to forget them… Every single thought has value. One
single thought can drive you to your dream, but usually it takes hundreds of
thoughts and, most importantly, to review them on an iterative basis, before
you achieve your goal and make your dream true.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Will
MYLE really make my life easier?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">It has already made our lives easier. We believe it will help you. That’s why we offer it for
you.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Why did you call it MYLE TAP?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">It is
an acronym. MYLE: “Makes Your Life Easier” when you Think, Act and Perform (TAP)
on your thoughts via a single fingertap.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>What’s the difference between MYLE TAP and SIRI?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The
only commonality between SIRI and MYLE is that both are voice powered
solutions. Everything else is different. Here are some main points:</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">a).<span> 
</span>MYLE does not pretend to have a mind of its own and argue
with you, nor it will endlessly ask for clarifications, distracting you and
losing your precious time. With MYLE, its user is fully in charge of the instant
data input that requires minimum distraction. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">b).<span> 
</span>SIRI is an advanced search engine positioned as a personal
assistant designed to execute a limited set of tasks. Once the task is
processed, SIRI “forgets” it. You cannot revisit the note. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">MYLE’s goal is to
be your mind and memory backer and its goal is not only execute your orders but
also to remember and categorize your thoughts and ideas as well as streamline
your daily routines via automation, timely reminders and advice. All your notes
are accessible at later time, until you decide to erase them. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">c).<span> 
</span>MYLE TAP can operate independently without any smartphone,
while SIRI is a part of your phone. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">d).<span> 
</span>With MYLE you are the owner of your data and no one but you
is able to access, use, share and utilize it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>I’m
using apps like <i>Evernote</i> to save my
ideas. Why do I still need MYLE?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">MYLE
is not a substitute to <i>Evernote</i> or to
any other system. Rather, through instantly capturing your voice notes in the
simplest and most natural way – by voice – MYLE simplifies and streamlines saving
of your thoughts and notes into your existing systems that you use and already
accustomed to. Like <i>Evernote</i>. And you
don’t need to have your mobile devices in hand all the time. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Is
there any reason to use MYLE for my business team?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Definitely: if you have total involvement in your business matters and you move
around a lot. If you want to share your thoughts, ideas, know statuses of your
tasks, improve your team’s and your own efficiency by not losing important
pieces of data. Having MYLE makes teamwork easier and more productive, because
we often happen to be struck by brilliant ideas in the most inappropriate time. Yet with MYLE you can capture them and share
with your team members. Like, saying “Slack, we need to add the predictive
analytics feature to the project” and your note will be shared with your team
in your Slack team-channel.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Can I use
MYLE app without TAP?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Technically yes, however our goal is to make your life easier by simplifying your
daily routines and operations. We believe it is only achievable by a
combination of instant thought catching and saving that can be done anywhere
and at any time. We developed MYLE application and TAP device for this
particular purpose. Without the TAP piece, MYLE app would be just another organizing
application that you will get bored of using in a few days.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Why
can't I use a simple microphone instead of MYLE TAP?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">You
can, but why would you? You would lose all the convenience and freedom you
enjoy with MYLE TAP. The simple microphone would also limit a number of
applications that you can use with it. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Using your MYLE</b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b><br/></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>How
hard it is for a non-technical person to set up the MYLE TAP?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Very
easy. Install the MYLE App as you would any other application. Start it, and
once inside, just choose “Connect”. MYLE will do the rest automatically.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>What
is the speech to text recognition quality?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">So
far we test-proved it in 9 languages, using native speakers. That includes
English, Spanish, French, Japanese, Russian, Arabic, Hindi, Turkish and Portuguese.
During a 60-days testing we’ve averaged the quality of up to 95%. The system has
a serious self-learning capability, that with time, as it learns your speech
and vocabulary, accuracy reaches to 95%-100% range.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Is English
the only language MYLE recognizes? What other languages you support in your
app?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">MYLE
supports over 40 languages. Voice recognition is provided by NUANCE
Voice-to-text service. Additionally through MYLE self-learning algorithms, we
can improve voice recognition quality by analyzing your speech and vocabulary.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>I
work in a noisy environment. Will my notes be still recognized?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">It
depends on how noisy it is. Based on our own experience – and our meetings are
held in a small room with many attendees, so it can be pretty noisy - MYLE TAP still
manages to work fine. Within MYLE App you can fine-tune MYLE TAP to the
background noise level. In most cases it cuts off all surrounding noise.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>What
if the recognition is incorrect and I checked the text note on the phone much
later. Can I play back my original voice note?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yes, the
notes are saved as well. In your mobile device access MYLE App, find the note
you need and tap [PLAY] button. If you still need your note, you can then make
corrections to the processed text.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Can I
set different number of taps for different functions?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">1, 2
and 3 taps are reserved for system purposes. Otherwise, you can set up any
number of controlling taps as you want. However, we’ve found that once the
number of tapping combinations exceeds 3, remembering their meanings becomes
difficult. Which defies the very purpose of MYLE – simply making your life easier.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>What
is the maximum length of a single voice message?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Currently,
we limited it at 30 seconds. The user can set his or her own message duration
via settings in MYLE App.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Can I
activate sound notifications from MYLE TAP?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yes,
you can do it by accessing settings in your MYLE App.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Will
MYLE TAP talk back to me?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">It will not. For the sake of simplicity,
efficiency and minimum distraction, as well as our alpha-testers surveys we
decided that we do not need yet another talking partner. Notes are captured
quietly, instantly and in most cases you don’t need your device to “Roger
That”.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Does MYLE
TAP track my activities like other tracking gadgets do? Like, can I measure burnt
calories and steps I took in a day?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yes you
can, but in a more enhanced way. You set up your goal and then save all notes
and steps you make achieving this goal. As an example, number of calories you
burn per day. After every meal tell MYLE what you ate to count consumed
calories. Tell MYLE when you start exercising and it will activate the accelerometer to count burnt calories. All the results and analytics can be found later
in your favorite activity tracking app or in your MYLE cloud account.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>What
if TAP is fully discharged. Will I lose all my saved notes?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">No,
you will not lose them. Recharge your MYLE TAP and once you have your paired
mobile device within Bluetooth range, all your saved voice notes will be synced
with your phone or tablet.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>How
can I attach MYLE TAP to my garment?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">On
the back of MYLE TAP has an aluminum bracket, with which you just clip it onto
your clothes of choice.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Technical: Hardware</b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b><br/></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>How
can I connect MYLE TAP to my smartphone?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Charge your TAP device. Launch MYLE application on your smartphone. If you are
using MYLE app for the first time, then select your device in its settings and
read the readouts to confirm connectivity. Next time, when your MYLE TAP and
your paired smartphone are within a Bluetooth range, the app and the device
will connect automatically.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Does
MYLE TAP need to be connected with my smartphone all the time?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">No,
MYLE TAP collects voice notes independently from the smartphone. Transfer of
voice notes to the smartphone happens automatically whenever MYLE TAP and the
smartphone are in Bluetooth range, and it doesn’t require user participation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Can I
connect my tablet to MYLE TAP?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Normally - yes. However, MYLE TAP utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard,
so your tablet should support BLE. To find out, refer to your tablet user guide
or contact the manufacturer. Other than that, it is not different from a
smartphone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>May I
connect my MYLE TAP to multiple smartphones or tablets?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yes.
Install MYLE App to each device you want to pair with MYLE TAP and run the same
pairing procedure as usual. Your MYLE TAP will “talk” to any of these devices
which happens to be in the Bluetooth range first. Once your data is processed
in your personal Cloud Account, it becomes equally accessible from any of the
paired devices.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Can I
use multiple MYLE TAPs with one mobile device?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yes,
eventually. This feature has not been fully tested as of today, but will be
available by the time of commercial release. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>What’s MYLE TAP battery life?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">For
an average user we estimate it to be able to last over one week.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>How
many messages can be saved in MYLE TAP memory? Can I upgrade the memory to
store more notes?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">MYLE
TAP is capable of storing up to 2000 voice notes. Maximum preset length of each
message is 30 seconds.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>How
are the saved notes transferred from MYLE TAP to my smartphone?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">All
communications within MYLE realm are based on our proprietary multi-stream
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocols.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Will
my MYLE TAP notify me if its battery is low?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yes.
Once MYLE TAP requires charging, its red light indicator will start blinking.
Additionally, via your MYLE App you can choose the beep alert as well.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>How
long does the battery take to charge?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Around two hours from fully discharged state.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>I
don’t remember where I put it. Can I find it?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yes.
MYLE TAP has the Lost-&amp;-Found feature. As long as your paired mobile device
is in Bluetooth range, it will prompt your MYLE TAP to blink red and beep.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Will
you expand the choice of MYLE TAP shell designs? Like rectangular, circle, etc.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">At
the start, there will be only one shape that gets the most votes from our supporters.
But we’re already busy developing new shapes. Subscribe to our mailing list and
let us know what you think – your ideas and your feedback is what will make
MYLE successful. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>There’s blue and red lights blinking, what does it mean? </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The red
light illuminates when the device is charging. Once the charge is complete, it
will go off.  The blue light illuminates
when the device becomes active and ready to record. It will go off once the
recording is finished. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>How

MYLE TAP works with








Stretchgoals






How it works









Your day with MYLE TAP

Safely take notes while driving




With MYLE TAP, you can keep your focus on the road, where it should be. With just the touch of a finger, you can save and identify a song from the radio, send a text or audio message to somebody, or add a detour notification to help other people reach their homes faster.

Instantly capture ideas and share with your team




Need to jot down notes after the meeting, while they are still fresh in your head? One tap
and they are in your Salesforce account or in Slack. Now you can have a break with
a well-deserved caffeine shot, while your team evaluates your notes.

Post or tweet with your voice



When you
see or experience something exciting, MYLE TAP gives you the ability to instantly share it with your
friends. Post on your Facebook or Tweet it on the go using only your voice, and
never lose time reaching your smartphone. 


Count calories or remember a new recipe 






With a
single finger tap, MYLE TAP can give you ideas for your dinner based on your
last grocery shopping list. It can also count your consumed calories, incorporate them
into your calorie tracking app, so you can visualize the data via graphs and numbers. 




Capture outdoor experiences on the go



Make instant notes about your outdoor adventures. Hike, camp, kayak or fish,
knowing that MYLE will keep your memories and impressions intact - even if you
left your smartphone at home. 

Track your time with a single touch


We use multiple applications to run our busy daily lives. Using your voice is the simplest, fastest and most
natural way to manage these apps. Just tap, speak, and relax! Keep that happy smile on your face, courtesy of MYLE!


Remember everything without a smartphone


During your sports break or morning exercise you will not be carrying a
pen and a notepad. Often, not even a smartphone. When something dawns on you,
simply tap the TAP to capture it.




MYLE TAP can do much more









Why you need MYLE TAP

Do you know that...













...and it can save your time


Savings come from
all the time spent daily reaching for the smartphone, unlocking, opening apps,
putting the phone back, etc. On top of that, MYLE will save much more time via automating routines and 
accomplishing tasks that previously were completed manually. And you’ll remember everything. In
just one tap.


And it can save your money too



It's simple math: assuming the average hourly pay in US and Canada is $25, you can easily calculate your yearly savings: $25 (per hour/day) x 20 (working days/month) x 12 (months/year) = $6,000 of just direct savings in just one year. 


All that with a single finger tap. Awesome?







Why MYLE TAP is so cool
We developed an amazing easy-to-use product with virtually unlimited functionality, which enables you to harness the full power of your mind.







Who is MYLE TAP for?

Business persons

All day on the run, endless meetings, endless list of things to
remember, an avalanche of ideas… And simply not enough time for everything. A
single finger tap will effectively capture and memorize a customer inquiry or a
million dollar idea, and will track and optimize time… Easily and effectively.


Creative people



Hundreds, if not thousands, of ideas never strike on schedule. Pens, paper,
smartphones may not be within arm’s reach and it takes too much time and effort
to record. By then the idea will be gone. For creative types fountaining
with ideas, MYLE TAP is the perfect solution. Simply tap it and speak out your
next great idea.


Busy moms





Kids are wonderful, smart, adorable, interesting, as well as inquisitive, persistent and capable of consuming all your attention. For multi-multi-tasking moms life suddenly will become so much easier
with just one tap. Shopping and to-do lists populated as fast as you speak –
and never forgotten or missed. A funny phrase from your little one captured for
family chronicles and shared on Facebook. A new recipe arrives into the recipe
app. Time to recall how to have good time, again.


Health watchers





Our health is what we should care about. MYLE TAP helps you easily
stay focused on a diet or on exercising. Keep track of consumed and burnt calories, diets or gym activities. Just tap and speak out. MYLE will do the rest. 




Perks




Mind-powered product

We believe that everyone - not just rocket scientists and Sheldon Cooper - is smart and capable to make the world around us a little bit better. We believe that everyone does generate millions of brilliant ideas. Still, we understand that our lives are so full of destractions and we are constantly short of time. That hampers us in remembering all of our great ideas or plans and putting them to work.
This is what engaged us to create MYLE TAP, a product which will change the way we think and memorize things. However, our biggest passion is the capability to make our lives easier, more enjoyable and effective. In developing this product we followed three basic principles:
Simple. The MYLE TAP is totally easy and intuitive to use for anyone. It requires very little to adapt and learn.
Intelligent. MYLE TAP is smart, self-learning and is powered by an extremely advanced analytic engine. It is packed with features, yet remains totally user-friendly.
Customizable. MYLE TAP is a user-driven product and comes with several customization options. MYLE user can easily and almost infinitely add applications and adapt MYLE TAP to his or her particular needs and preferences.
 


Specifications














Software Development Kit

We talked to over 500 people about ways to make their lives easier. Their feedback helped
us design dozens of MYLE applications (called ""Mylets"") like ""List of Thoughts"", ""Personal Budget"", ""Calories Counter"" and others:



Of course,
we understand that 500 are only a drop in the ocean. And this is why we decided to create free SDK/API to
enable everyone to develop their own applications or integrate their existing apps with MYLE. We made extra effort to make this tool totally easy and user-friendly to use for everyone familiar with the basics of JavaScript, HTML, GitHub and frameworks. 
Interested? Contact us at sdk@getmyle.com. 













Service Plans
MYLE TAP includes the MYLE App and the standard free service package.  This will also include MYLE App free updates.
At a later date, after MYLE TAP shipments commence, optional service plans will become available for a fee. They will include such optional features as increased number of daily processed notes, more customized apps and ability to store events over a longer period of time. These premium plans still do not require signing a contract. Campaign contributions do not sign you up for a paid service plan. 


Why us?

We
experienced first-hand the pain of trying to memorize and later recall all our
ideas and thoughts, whether it's a casual thought to buy a milk on the way home tonight or a great idea on how to optimize an algorithm. As well, we wanted to not only remember everything but also make it beneficial. We
tried to use existing solutions, but quickly discovered their functional
limitations and amount of hassle involved when using them regularly. 
As we
talked with hundreds of people to gather some feedback to our idea, and quickly found
how common this problem is. People of all ages and from all walks of life
confessed to having the same trouble of keeping their thoughts remembered and turning them into actions.
Inspired by
the desire to make life easier for so many people as well as for ourselves, we
committed to building our own solution. It would be totally simple and easy to
use - just tap and talk - yet be intelligent and endlessly customizable. 
To achieve this goal
we assembled a dynamic and passionate team of scientists, engineers and
entrepreneurs with a formidable intellectual power. We got strong support not
just from families and friends, but also from experienced advisors in the tech
industry. We believe that together we will make MYLE TAP a success. And ultimately will Make Your
Life Easier.





Product Development







We started with crude 3D printer moldings and a bunch of wild ideas. We diligently, passionately and  tirelessly worked through various development stages. Hardware, software, firmware, system architecture, patents. We successfully went through all these challenges to now have fully functional wearable prototypes, backed by software platform and constantly growing number of MYLE Applications.







Why we need your support


To date, we have built several prototype devices and software applications, that are being tried by alpha-testers. We need your support to complete the developement stage and start manufacturing the commercial product. Your contributions will help turn the MYLE vision into a reality and help the MYLE team to bring this exciting product to the market.
The funds you contribute will be used to:

Finalize charging dock design
Order injection mold tooling
Finalize application and cloud platform
Pay for initial cost of goods; and
Most importantly, deliver the MYLE TAP to you!


Oh and we’re also looking for a smart and extremely creative Marketing
Manager who will help us deliver our brilliant idea to the mass market. Is that
you? Help us to build your professional future ;)









Timeline









Thank you!



Thank you for all your support and feedback! We couldn't have gotten as far as we have now without our families, friends, backers, mentors, and all the wonderful tech community. We are endlessly grateful and can't wait to bring MYLE TAP to market.


Risks and challenges

We are
realists and are completely open about the possible obstacles that may delay
your  MYLE TAP delivery. Having
considered all possible risks we are sharing the main ones, so you know what we
are dealing with.


Component supply: MYLE TAP is built
using a significant amount of components coming from multiple global suppliers,
which have different lead times. If any of these suppliers amends or extends
their agreed lead times, this will disturb or delay the entire production
cycle. To prevent this we are actively searching for reserve suppliers for TAP
components.
Design changes and enhancements: Once the
production has started, there will be several 
parameters that can be changed or diversified  in order to improve your experience with TAP.
Adding new shell shapes, expanding colour palette, increasing data transfer
speed, etc. Making such enhancements during production can be challenging and
potentially affect deliveries. We try to accomodate such changes in advance to
ensure that TAP ships with superior quality.
Shipping and customs: When shipping starts,
there will always be a risk of the logistical delays caused by freighters,
shipments getting stuck in Customs. It may happen either when we are receiving
the products from the factory, or when shipping them to you. We are working on
building our supply chain as reliable as we can and hope there won't be any
delays.

F.A.Q.

About MYLE

Why should I care about instantly capturing my thoughts? 
Because it’s so easy to forget them… Every single thought has value. One
single thought can drive you to your dream, but usually it takes hundreds of
thoughts and, most importantly, to review them on an iterative basis, before
you achieve your goal and make your dream true.

Will
MYLE really make my life easier?
It has already made our lives easier. We believe it will help you. That’s why we offer it for
you.

Why did you call it MYLE TAP?
It is
an acronym. MYLE: “Makes Your Life Easier” when you Think, Act and Perform (TAP)
on your thoughts via a single fingertap.

What’s the difference between MYLE TAP and SIRI?
The
only commonality between SIRI and MYLE is that both are voice powered
solutions. Everything else is different. Here are some main points:
a). 
MYLE does not pretend to have a mind of its own and argue
with you, nor it will endlessly ask for clarifications, distracting you and
losing your precious time. With MYLE, its user is fully in charge of the instant
data input that requires minimum distraction. 
b). 
SIRI is an advanced search engine positioned as a personal
assistant designed to execute a limited set of tasks. Once the task is
processed, SIRI “forgets” it. You cannot revisit the note. 
MYLE’s goal is to
be your mind and memory backer and its goal is not only execute your orders but
also to remember and categorize your thoughts and ideas as well as streamline
your daily routines via automation, timely reminders and advice. All your notes
are accessible at later time, until you decide to erase them. 
c). 
MYLE TAP can operate independently without any smartphone,
while SIRI is a part of your phone. 
d). 
With MYLE you are the owner of your data and no one but you
is able to access, use, share and utilize it.

I’m
using apps like Evernote to save my
ideas. Why do I still need MYLE?
MYLE
is not a substitute to Evernote or to
any other system. Rather, through instantly capturing your voice notes in the
simplest and most natural way – by voice – MYLE simplifies and streamlines saving
of your thoughts and notes into your existing systems that you use and already
accustomed to. Like Evernote. And you
don’t need to have your mobile devices in hand all the time. 

Is
there any reason to use MYLE for my business team?
Definitely: if you have total involvement in your business matters and you move
around a lot. If you want to share your thoughts, ideas, know statuses of your
tasks, improve your team’s and your own efficiency by not losing important
pieces of data. Having MYLE makes teamwork easier and more productive, because
we often happen to be struck by brilliant ideas in the most inappropriate time. Yet with MYLE you can capture them and share
with your team members. Like, saying “Slack, we need to add the predictive
analytics feature to the project” and your note will be shared with your team
in your Slack team-channel.

Can I use
MYLE app without TAP?
Technically yes, however our goal is to make your life easier by simplifying your
daily routines and operations. We believe it is only achievable by a
combination of instant thought catching and saving that can be done anywhere
and at any time. We developed MYLE application and TAP device for this
particular purpose. Without the TAP piece, MYLE app would be just another organizing
application that you will get bored of using in a few days.

Why
can't I use a simple microphone instead of MYLE TAP?
You
can, but why would you? You would lose all the convenience and freedom you
enjoy with MYLE TAP. The simple microphone would also limit a number of
applications that you can use with it. 

Using your MYLE

How
hard it is for a non-technical person to set up the MYLE TAP?
Very
easy. Install the MYLE App as you would any other application. Start it, and
once inside, just choose “Connect”. MYLE will do the rest automatically.

What
is the speech to text recognition quality?
So
far we test-proved it in 9 languages, using native speakers. That includes
English, Spanish, French, Japanese, Russian, Arabic, Hindi, Turkish and Portuguese.
During a 60-days testing we’ve averaged the quality of up to 95%. The system has
a serious self-learning capability, that with time, as it learns your speech
and vocabulary, accuracy reaches to 95%-100% range.

Is English
the only language MYLE recognizes? What other languages you support in your
app?
MYLE
supports over 40 languages. Voice recognition is provided by NUANCE
Voice-to-text service. Additionally through MYLE self-learning algorithms, we
can improve voice recognition quality by analyzing your speech and vocabulary.

I
work in a noisy environment. Will my notes be still recognized?
It
depends on how noisy it is. Based on our own experience – and our meetings are
held in a small room with many attendees, so it can be pretty noisy - MYLE TAP still
manages to work fine. Within MYLE App you can fine-tune MYLE TAP to the
background noise level. In most cases it cuts off all surrounding noise.

What
if the recognition is incorrect and I checked the text note on the phone much
later. Can I play back my original voice note?
Yes, the
notes are saved as well. In your mobile device access MYLE App, find the note
you need and tap [PLAY] button. If you still need your note, you can then make
corrections to the processed text.

Can I
set different number of taps for different functions?
1, 2
and 3 taps are reserved for system purposes. Otherwise, you can set up any
number of controlling taps as you want. However, we’ve found that once the
number of tapping combinations exceeds 3, remembering their meanings becomes
difficult. Which defies the very purpose of MYLE – simply making your life easier.

What
is the maximum length of a single voice message?
Currently,
we limited it at 30 seconds. The user can set his or her own message duration
via settings in MYLE App.

Can I
activate sound notifications from MYLE TAP?
Yes,
you can do it by accessing settings in your MYLE App.

Will
MYLE TAP talk back to me?
It will not. For the sake of simplicity,
efficiency and minimum distraction, as well as our alpha-testers surveys we
decided that we do not need yet another talking partner. Notes are captured
quietly, instantly and in most cases you don’t need your device to “Roger
That”.

Does MYLE
TAP track my activities like other tracking gadgets do? Like, can I measure burnt
calories and steps I took in a day?
Yes you
can, but in a more enhanced way. You set up your goal and then save all notes
and steps you make achieving this goal. As an example, number of calories you
burn per day. After every meal tell MYLE what you ate to count consumed
calories. Tell MYLE when you start exercising and it will activate the accelerometer to count burnt calories. All the results and analytics can be found later
in your favorite activity tracking app or in your MYLE cloud account.

What
if TAP is fully discharged. Will I lose all my saved notes?
No,
you will not lose them. Recharge your MYLE TAP and once you have your paired
mobile device within Bluetooth range, all your saved voice notes will be synced
with your phone or tablet.

How
can I attach MYLE TAP to my garment?
On
the back of MYLE TAP has an aluminum bracket, with which you just clip it onto
your clothes of choice.

Technical: Hardware

How
can I connect MYLE TAP to my smartphone?
Charge your TAP device. Launch MYLE application on your smartphone. If you are
using MYLE app for the first time, then select your device in its settings and
read the readouts to confirm connectivity. Next time, when your MYLE TAP and
your paired smartphone are within a Bluetooth range, the app and the device
will connect automatically.

Does
MYLE TAP need to be connected with my smartphone all the time?
No,
MYLE TAP collects voice notes independently from the smartphone. Transfer of
voice notes to the smartphone happens automatically whenever MYLE TAP and the
smartphone are in Bluetooth range, and it doesn’t require user participation.

Can I
connect my tablet to MYLE TAP?
Normally - yes. However, MYLE TAP utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard,
so your tablet should support BLE. To find out, refer to your tablet user guide
or contact the manufacturer. Other than that, it is not different from a
smartphone.

May I
connect my MYLE TAP to multiple smartphones or tablets?
Yes.
Install MYLE App to each device you want to pair with MYLE TAP and run the same
pairing procedure as usual. Your MYLE TAP will “talk” to any of these devices
which happens to be in the Bluetooth range first. Once your data is processed
in your personal Cloud Account, it becomes equally accessible from any of the
paired devices.  

Can I
use multiple MYLE TAPs with one mobile device?
Yes,
eventually. This feature has not been fully tested as of today, but will be
available by the time of commercial release. 

What’s MYLE TAP battery life?
For
an average user we estimate it to be able to last over one week.

How
many messages can be saved in MYLE TAP memory? Can I upgrade the memory to
store more notes?
MYLE
TAP is capable of storing up to 2000 voice notes. Maximum preset length of each
message is 30 seconds.

How
are the saved notes transferred from MYLE TAP to my smartphone?
All
communications within MYLE realm are based on our proprietary multi-stream
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocols.

Will
my MYLE TAP notify me if its battery is low?
Yes.
Once MYLE TAP requires charging, its red light indicator will start blinking.
Additionally, via your MYLE App you can choose the beep alert as well.  

How
long does the battery take to charge?
Around two hours from fully discharged state.

I
don’t remember where I put it. Can I find it?
Yes.
MYLE TAP has the Lost-&-Found feature. As long as your paired mobile device
is in Bluetooth range, it will prompt your MYLE TAP to blink red and beep.

Will
you expand the choice of MYLE TAP shell designs? Like rectangular, circle, etc.
At
the start, there will be only one shape that gets the most votes from our supporters.
But we’re already busy developing new shapes. Subscribe to our mailing list and
let us know what you think – your ideas and your feedback is what will make
MYLE successful. 

There’s blue and red lights blinking, what does it mean? 
The red
light illuminates when the device is charging. Once the charge is complete, it
will go off.  The blue light illuminates
when the device becomes active and ready to record. It will go off once the
recording is finished. 

How
can I turn off the TAP when I see it’s on?
Just wait for 3 seconds and the device will turn off automatically. The ON/OFF
interval is customizable via MYLE App. Or, you can tap it twice.

Technical: Software

What
mobile platforms will MYLE work with?
Currently iOS and Android
only. Windows Phone 8 and Blackberry are coming soon.

What
is  a “Mylet”?
It’s
a single-purpose mini-application within MYLE App. It is focused on a specific
problem and solution (e.g. sending your brilliant idea to your Evernote
account; converting your words about an eaten apple into a calories intake report;
etc.).

How
can I install the Mylets?
Go to
MYLE Market. Browse and choose the Mylet you like. Tap on the Mylet icon that
you want. Then the Mylet icon is transferred automatically onto your MYLE App dashboard.

How
many Mylets are there in MYLE Market?
At
the moment we have two dozen Mylets for testing purposes. By the time MYLE TAP
becomes commercially available there will be several hundred of them.

Is it
possible to develop my own Mylet?
Yes. We
have developed free MYLE SDK/API tools, named Constructor and Integrator, to
help you easily design and develop your own Mylets. Required user-developer
skill level – basic level of Java-Script and/or HTML 5. You can use your Mylet
yourself AND share them with your friends and other users via MYLE Market. 

Is it
possible to link MYLE with my own application.
Yes,
using our free MYLE SDK/API tools, Constructor and Integrator, you’ll be able
to create your own mini-applications (Mylets) within MYLE environment (via
Constructor) as well as integrate your existing applications with MYLE, its

<p>I've grown up surrounded by the redwoods of the Santa Cruz mountains. Wood is a remarkable material, it's cool to the touch but not cold like metal. It feels natural on your wrist and the smooth polish imparts an amazing feeling. Lay your hand on any fine crafted wooden good and run your hand along the surface, it's a feel that no artificial material can recreate, it just feels RIGHT.</p>
<p>These bands impart an individuality and uniqueness to a smartwatch that hasn't been seen yet. In contrast to the dozens of identically machined bands out there, wood creates truly unique pieces.</p>

All device connectors, buttons and holes are rubberized in order to totally prevent moisture seeping into the unit. The touchscreen is made of shockproof glass. Acceptable device operating temperatures range from -22°F to 140°F. The device panel is securely attached to the entry door with a MultiLock protection system, which is almost impossible to open without a key (smart-phone or fingerprint in our case). The fastener is made from mounting loops, located on the four corners of the body. This allows anyone to attach the device to the door through mounting holes using bolts and nuts or to the wall using dowels. Mounting loops are protected with special locks that restrict access to the bolt heads.</p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">The device consists of two different, integrated parts: the external control panel and internal coordination module. The external control panel is equipped with sensors, camera and microphone, speakers and touchscreen. All main components, including motherboard with CPU and memory, communication ports, 3G, Wi-Fi, FM modules, SIM slot is  taken out to the coordination module. There is a special connector located on the back side of the control panel used to connect to the coordination module. This module is designed to be mounted inside the dwelling. The coordination module features a built-in alarm siren that can be activated on movement detection or electronic seals corruption. This behavior can be configured by device administrator.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 14px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vitaphone.tv/igg/hr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Engineering drawing: items description</i><img alt=""Engineering drawing: items description"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vitaphone.tv/igg/engineering-labels.png"" src="""" style=""display: block;""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Engineering drawing: device moulding</i><img alt=""Engineering drawing: device moulding"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vitaphone.tv/igg/engineering-drawings.png"" src="""" style=""display: block;""/></p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">Four mounting holes and one cable hole need to be drilled to attach the external panel to the door or wall. The rear (internal) camera is connected to coordination module and installed separately (rear camera is available depending on device build). In that way, a complete system can be installed after drilling nine holes in total: five for the external panel and four for the internal module. The cable length between main panel and coordination module can be up to twenty six feet long.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 14px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vitaphone.tv/igg/hr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Color range.</i><img alt=""Color gamma"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vitaphone.tv/igg/color-gamma.png"" src="""" style=""display: block;""/></p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">We have chosen colors based on the ones that are used in the building and the door decoration, so they are not as rich and deep as for example, Apple used for iPhone 5c.

<li style=""text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 5px;"">In case a would-be vandal still managed to cut off the device, it will be completely non-functional without the communication module anyway. There is no sense in stealing the external front panel because it just can't work without the paired communication module.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 5px;"">Our device is equipped with a camera and motion sensor.

Vitaliy lived at that time in Florida and in February, 2014 he came to Brooklyn to visit his mother. I (Igor) was living not far from his mother’s house at that time. Taking this opportunity and in spite of the terrible weather Vitaliy decided to drop by and visit me.</p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">Winter 2013-2014 was among the coldest on record and in those days there was a heavy snowfall in Brooklyn. I was home and delved into my garage (I can’t remember what I was looking for, but it doesn’t matter anyway). Vitaliy rang my doorbell for a long time, since he knew I was home since the light was on in my kitchen.</p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">Vitaliy began to freeze after about 5 minutes of trying to get me to come to the door. He took out his smartphone that flatly refused to work because he was wearing gloves and couldn't properly work his phone. Even after he took his gloves off, he had no luck because it was too cold for his phone's touchscreen to work.</p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">Vitaily then went to a nearby cafe and ordered tea to keep warm. After a few minutes, his smartphone warmed and started working again and Vitaliy called me. We talked and after he finished his tea he went to my house again. This time of course I was waiting for him.</p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">During the discussion of the occurred incident Vitaliy suddenly noticed: It would be cool if your entryphone could call directly to your smartphone. That evening we sat and chatted for a while and then Vitaly went home.</p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">The next evening Vitaliy come to me with an USB pendrive and presented a new awesome project to me - <strong style=""color: #36C;"">VITAphone<sup style=""font-variant: small-caps;"">neo</sup></strong>.

What is VITAphoneneo?«VITAphoneneo» is a smart cloud-based intercom powered by Android OS, that mounts near or directly to the front door of any home. It features a 9.7"" IPS LCD with touchscreen, dual cameras, microphone, speakers, biometric scanner, as well as light, temperature and humidity sensors. The device is connected to the Internet for full access from anywhere. When a visitor comes to your home, they'll use the touchscreen to do the equivalent of ringing a doorbell using the «call» button. A few seconds later you hear your doorbell ringing - from your smart phone! This lets you know about every visitor to your home even if you're in Hong Kong or Hawaii or anywhere in the world.VITAphoneneo key features highlight.After you find out who's at your door you can start a conversation right there with them from your phone to your front door. Even if your front door is a thousand miles away from where you are at the moment.ANIMATION: Answer your door from the airplane.Unlike other entryphones available on the market, VITAphoneneo requires no additional control panel installation for each apartment. All You need is an internet-connected PC, Mac or modern smart-phone or tablet to be able to use all VITAphoneneo features. Due to the fact VITAphoneneo is much more scalable, our product is far most cost effective when compared to the current generation of entryphones and significantly superior to them in features.VITAphoneneo system provides SMS-based device management (SMS commands are free of charge): You can open and close the door, control the alarm and video recording systems or just send a simple text message that will be displayed on the VITAphoneneo display. We have implemented a web-based interface that allows you to use and administrate your intercom from any device with internet browser support.VITAphoneneo is mostly cordless excluding the power supply, and features a built-in rechargeable battery that allows our intercom to actively run up to 10 hours in case of power failure.
Where is VITAphoneneo useful?VITAphoneneo has almost endless possibilities. You can open the door for your visitor without even leaving the couch by pressing a single button on your smart-phone. It's equally easy to send a door lock command to the intercom. This is an indispensable feature for the elderly or the infirm living alone who find it difficult to make their way across their home to perform routine tasks.Thanks to the built-in biometric scanner you don't need to carry a bunch of keys to your home or office anymore. Just swipe your finger over the sensor and your door will open.ANIMATION: Biometric scanner in action.You can always see what's happening on either side of the front door. All You have to do is open the application on the smart-phone and start watching. Built-in high quality infrared cameras are capable of monitoring and even recording what's happening even in total darkness. Thanks to the PIR-motion sensor, video streaming and recording will be enabled in case of movement detection with real-time imaging instantly available on your smart phone. All of these features makes VITAphoneneo a worthy and more economical alternative to expensive security systems. Alarm system could be activated in case of unrecognized movement detection. Electric lock is blocked by VITAphoneneo in case of unauthorized attempts to open the lock, thereby denying the possibility of using lockpicks to hack it.When security alarm system is activated VITAphoneneo will:
Block the electric lock.

A few words about device moulding and mounting.The device body is waterproof and is made of durable stainless steel. All device connectors, buttons and holes are rubberized in order to totally prevent moisture seeping into the unit. The touchscreen is made of shockproof glass. Acceptable device operating temperatures range from -22°F to 140°F. The device panel is securely attached to the entry door with a MultiLock protection system, which is almost impossible to open without a key (smart-phone or fingerprint in our case). The fastener is made from mounting loops, located on the four corners of the body. This allows anyone to attach the device to the door through mounting holes using bolts and nuts or to the wall using dowels. Mounting loops are protected with special locks that restrict access to the bolt heads.The device consists of two different, integrated parts: the external control panel and internal coordination module. The external control panel is equipped with sensors, camera and microphone, speakers and touchscreen. All main components, including motherboard with CPU and memory, communication ports, 3G, Wi-Fi, FM modules, SIM slot is  taken out to the coordination module. There is a special connector located on the back side of the control panel used to connect to the coordination module. This module is designed to be mounted inside the dwelling. The coordination module features a built-in alarm siren that can be activated on movement detection or electronic seals corruption. This behavior can be configured by device administrator.Engineering drawing: items descriptionEngineering drawing: device mouldingFour mounting holes and one cable hole need to be drilled to attach the external panel to the door or wall. The rear (internal) camera is connected to coordination module and installed separately (rear camera is available depending on device build). In that way, a complete system can be installed after drilling nine holes in total: five for the external panel and four for the internal module. The cable length between main panel and coordination module can be up to twenty six feet long.Color range.We have chosen colors based on the ones that are used in the building and the door decoration, so they are not as rich and deep as for example, Apple used for iPhone 5c. Imagine how it would look bright yellow device on the dark brown door.
VITAphoneneo has complex antitheft system.«But this device, mounted right near or directly on my door will surely attract the attention of a thief» - You may think. Don't worry! We have done our best to make theft almost impossible and meaningless. That's because:

VITAphoneneo has an ultra-durable steel body, so any attempts to pry it open with a screwdriver will just not work.
Mounting bolts are protected by special covers with locks, that can be opened by the key. All four mounting loops are protected by the electronic seals.
In case a would-be vandal still managed to cut off the device, it will be completely non-functional without the communication module anyway. There is no sense in stealing the external front panel because it just can't work without the paired communication module.
Our device is equipped with a camera and motion sensor. The remote server video recording service will be immediately automatically activated as soon as a would-be thief approaches the VITAphoneneo.
In case of unauthorized violation of the electronic seal on any of the mounting bolts, an alarm will sound and your own personalized recorded message will be played (e. g., «MOVE AWAY FROM THE DOOR AND LEAVE! THE POLICE ARE BEING CALLED!» ) There is a configurable option that can intended to send a notification to the house owner or to make an emergency call to 911.
Clearly, there is no reason in the world for a thief to even try and steal the device.

The VITAphoneneo StoryVITAphoneneo was born in Brooklyn, New York. Vitaliy lived at that time in Florida and in February, 2014 he came to Brooklyn to visit his mother. I (Igor) was living not far from his mother’s house at that time. Taking this opportunity and in spite of the terrible weather Vitaliy decided to drop by and visit me.Winter 2013-2014 was among the coldest on record and in those days there was a heavy snowfall in Brooklyn. I was home and delved into my garage (I can’t remember what I was looking for, but it doesn’t matter anyway). Vitaliy rang my doorbell for a long time, since he knew I was home since the light was on in my kitchen.Vitaliy began to freeze after about 5 minutes of trying to get me to come to the door. He took out his smartphone that flatly refused to work because he was wearing gloves and couldn't properly work his phone. Even after he took his gloves off, he had no luck because it was too cold for his phone's touchscreen to work.Vitaily then went to a nearby cafe and ordered tea to keep warm. After a few minutes, his smartphone warmed and started working again and Vitaliy called me. We talked and after he finished his tea he went to my house again. This time of course I was waiting for him.During the discussion of the occurred incident Vitaliy suddenly noticed: It would be cool if your entryphone could call directly to your smartphone. That evening we sat and chatted for a while and then Vitaly went home.The next evening Vitaliy come to me with an USB pendrive and presented a new awesome project to me - VITAphoneneo. Since then we added new features almost every hour and nothing could stop us until we ended up developing the VITAphoneneo which we are now introducing to you.We spent six months in planning and preparing VITAphoneneo and now we are ready to start device production.
Who Can Benefit from VITAphoneneo?From the beginning VITAphoneneo was just a simple entryphone replacement with an Internet connection that allows anyone to «receive visitors» online using their smartphone.At that time we had no idea how this project will grow, but right now we know that VITAphoneneo is useful literally for absolutely everyone! Now VITAphoneneo is not just a smart cloud intercom - it is a complex security system for your house, your business, your car, bike or boat as well as an interactive vehicle management system and DVR. VITAphoneneo can completely replace an existing visitor management system in your office. VITAphoneneo is an the heart of communication infrastructure that features notification, communication and organizational capabilities for residents of any home or apartment or office building.Imagine: you have an urgent business trip and you are flying out of town. At the same time your mom suddenly decided to drop in for a visit and nobody's there to give her a warm welcome or even let her in. Thanks to VITAphoneneo, this is no longer a problem - you can remotely open the door, add her fingerprint into VITAphone's database or authorize her smartphone to control your device with just a few touches on your smartphone. You can talk with your mom right there from the airplane.And this is just one of dozens of different scenarios. During preparation, planning and development of the system we have discovered hundreds and thousands of similar stories and we continue to discover more and more opportunities to use VITAphoneneo and make life easier.So, if after reading this information you still think that VITAphoneneo is not suitable for you, it is likely that you just yet haven’t realized all the possibilities VITAphoneneo has - they are almost endless.And if you come up with new and unique usage for VITAphoneneo, that makes it even bigger and better - we always happy to hear it and improve our device based on your suggestions!Authors of the best ideas will be rewarded with the free VITAphoneneo device that will be improved based on their ideas.
Why Crowdfunding?During the project preparation and development stages we have repeatedly raised the question about project financing. We considered various options on how to obtain money required to complete the project and start production.After repeated evaluations of all pros and cons of borrowing money, start-up investments from outside investors and our own savings, we realized that we needed something totally different, something new and unique, as all evaluated options had more cons than pros.Now, with our project in its final stage, we can’t think of anything better than crowdfunding to provide the money we need to make our idea a reality. That's because we can get the funds necessary to start production and our backers get new unique device at a substantial discount. In addition, we hope to get new ideas, comments and suggestions from the public. Every user can take a direct part in future VITAphoneneo product development by sharing their ideas and experiences with us.VITAphoneneo has amazing properties. Only one VITAphoneneo device is needed to manage residential or office building, therefore its price for every user can be less than one dollar, because users can organize a collective purchase.

<h3>// THE BOARD</h3>
<p><i>""Arduino is a tool for making computers that can sense and control more of the physical world than your desktop computer. It's an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple micro-controller board, and a development environment for writing software for the board.</i></p>
<p><i>Arduino can be used to develop interactive objects, taking inputs from a variety of switches or sensors, and controlling a variety of lights, motors, and other physical outputs. ""</i></p>

<br/><p><b>Why the Arduino UNO ?</b></p>
<p>Because it's the most popular and used Arduino. You will find a lot of tutorials around the web using an Arduino UNO. Furthermore, it is compatible with the majority of shields (giving you more functionalities).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Arduino Uno is based on the ATmega328. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.</p>

<p>We really appreciate every single of your support, help us bring the<b> Affor</b>duino Starter Kit into the hands of people all around the world.</p>
<p>Let’s make this happen together, we can't wait to deliver the kit to you !</p>
</div>
</div></div>","We believe technology should be affordable for everyone. And this starts with electronic.This is made possible with the Afforduino Starter Kit.The 19$ kit is composed of :
1x Arduino UNO R3-like with USB Cable
1x Solderless Breadboard & 40x Jumper Wires
Cardboard box
Inputs :
1x LM35 temperature sensor
1x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Ranging Module (to measure distances)

5x Push buttons & 5x 10KΩ resistors
1x 10KΩ potentometers


Outputs :



1x Sound buzzer (bipper)
20x LEDs (5x Green, 5x Red, 5x Blue, 5x Yellow) + 20x Resistors for the LEDs
1x Basic LCD Module & 1x Header Pin Male 2.54 1*40




(resistors aren't represented in the picture)
In short, everything you need to begin electronic is included.
If you are looking for a great starting point into hardware programming or are simply on a budget, look no further than the Afforduino Starter Kit.

The components used in the kit have a high quality standard.
A soldering iron and soldering wire are necessary to solder the header pins to the LCD. They aren't included in the kit because many peoples already possess one. You can find them here or here for less than 10$.

// 20.000$ GOAL

We constantly look to improve our kit. If we raise more than 20.000$, we will have a sufficient manufacturing quantity to lower the price of the components. 
In this case, we'll add a 5V Relay Module to the kit, for free and for everyone.

A relay can be used to power on/off home elements like lamps, speaker, etc...
Imagine the possibilities coupled with the Arduino !


// THE BOARD
""Arduino is a tool for making computers that can sense and control more of the physical world than your desktop computer. It's an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple micro-controller board, and a development environment for writing software for the board.
Arduino can be used to develop interactive objects, taking inputs from a variety of switches or sensors, and controlling a variety of lights, motors, and other physical outputs. ""
- Arduino.cc
Here is an original Arduino UNO compared to the Afforduino UNO. 


WE CONFIRM THAT OUR ARDUINO BOARD IS NOT AFFECTED BY THE FTDI DRIVER UPDATE WHICH BRICK THE BOARDS INCLUDING A CLONE FT232 CHIP.
An official Arduino UNO cost around 20$. As it is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5 license. This means that anyone can use their project (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/).
To program the Arduino, nothing easier. Just connect the board to the computer using USB and download the Arduino IDE.


Why the Arduino UNO ?
Because it's the most popular and used Arduino. You will find a lot of tutorials around the web using an Arduino UNO. Furthermore, it is compatible with the majority of shields (giving you more functionalities).

The Arduino Uno is based on the ATmega328. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.

// EXAMPLES 
The endless possibilities with this kit are only limited by your imagination !

1. Pressing the button nearer the top of the breadboard will turn the LED on, pressing the other button will turn the LED off.



2. Showing how many retweet has a tweet

3. Bip when the temperature down below 20°C (reminder to close the windows)



// 19$ ?
To reach our 19$ price we can't manufacture the boards in Italy, like Arduino. The manufacturing of the Afforduino Kit has to be done in China.
Thus, we need to produce enough volume to bring the unit costs down.
Compared to the other equivalent kits on the market, the Afforduino Kit is about 4 times cheaper.

// OUR PROJECT
Since my youngest age I have always been passionate by technology, particularly electronic and felt the pleasure to create things.
Nobody in my family/friends was experimented in electronic, I undertake to buy electronics components from scratch. I bought for about 150$ of components but I just didn't know at all how to make them work.
Not so long ago, my brother saw me working on a project and asked me to teach him some things. My researchs on internet to buy him basics components leaded to the Sparkfun Inventor's Kit, an interesting concept. 
But wait... Almost 100$ !
This was the starting point of the project. 
After spending a lot of time negotiating the production prices with different manufacturers, we managed to reach a final price of 19$.
Why the campaign duration is only 13 days ?
Because we need to be ready to produce the Christmas Edition.

The connector is elevated slightly so there is enough space for these difficulties and guarantees a good connection.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1091222/files/20141212023503-FC_weiss_Dock_Connector.jpg?1418380503"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p><p><br/></p><p style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></p><h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Dear Apple User</span></h2><p>We would have loved to introduce ""pure"" Apple Lightning Connections to FlexCharger. We decided against this, because of the extreme costs that would occur (for you) when original Apple certified Lightnings are built in (see Apples MFI Program). We are determined to win you for FlexCharger, so we included 3 Original Certified Apple Lightning Adapters in the Perk. Nevertheless FlexCharger allows the use of adapters, so you shouldn't have difficulties.

<h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">FAQ's</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Which Wireless Charging standard are you going to integrate?<br/></b>We decided to integrated the Qi standard which seems to be the most sophisticated and successful standard in the market. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Why do you call your Wireless Charger ""True Wireless Charger""</b>?<br/>As a result of FlexCharger fitting directly into your power outlet, there are no cables whatsoever, therefore being ""Truely"" wireless. Other Wireless Chargers have a cable running from the Charger Pad to the outlet. As far as we know, FlexCharger is the only ""True"" Wireless Charger.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>What do I have to add for shipping?</b><br/>- International $ 15<br/>- Germany $ 5<br/>Shipping is something we do not want to earn money with, so we calculated very tough to offer you the best rates possible. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>How many different versions do you offer?</b><br/>3 versions<br/>- FlexCharger S<br/>- FlexCharger W: Wireless Charger integrated in the tray<br/>- FlexCharger W/R: Wireless Charger + Wi-Fi Repeater integrated</li>
<li>
<b>I heard about a new USB - C standard. Does this mean that my FlexCharger is not future proof?</b><br/>The C - standard is a great move of the USB Implementers Forum (USB IF). We really appreciate this new plug because it will bring us many advantages. Nevertheless it wouldn't make sense to integrate it already because it will take a couple of years until we get the first devices with the new standard integrated. Should you in the meantime acquire a device with USB - C, simply buy one or more adapters and FlexCharger will stay up to date! As soon as it makes sense we will integrate the new standard in our FlexCharger.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>I<b>f I'm going to use adapters, is FlexCharger</b> designed for this?<br/></b>FlexCharger was developed with the option of using Lightning adapters. These adapters can easily be connected and then integrated into the form of the casing. We also integrated a storage compartment at the back, primarily for Lightning adapters and or 30 pin adapters from Apple.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>And what if I want to use an adapter for the Tiltable Dock Connector?<br/></b>This is also possible. Simply tilt your smart device towards the wall and you will get the necessary stability when touching the wall with the upper edge of the smart device.</li>
<li>
<b>Do I need to pull FlexCharger out of the power outlet when extracting the retractable cable for Walk &amp; Charge?<br/></b>No. Simply pull downwards or sidewards. The retractable mechanism is designed in such a way that you can't pull out this cable straight towards yourself.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>I use a case for my smartphone. Can I plug it in the Tiltable Dock Connector?<br/></b>Yes. We elevated the connector slightly in order to prevent loosing contact. </li>
<li>
<b>I use a case for my smartphone. Can I plug it in upright position on the Tray?</b><br/>FlexCharger has a mini 3.9"" (10 cm) cable for on-tray charging – integrated and retractable for vertical or horizontal charging. By charging devices in a vertical upright position, the cable can be passed through the tray window and connected. This concept also allows for sleeves or covers to be kept on while charging.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Can I charge a large tablet on FlexCharger?</b><br/>Yes. We recommend that you either charge horizontally on the tray with the long retractable cable or vertically with the short tray cable (USB 3.0 would also be an option). Although possible, we do not recommend the Tiltable Dock Connector because of eventual problems with stability.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Does my <b>smartphone have enough </b>stability when plugged into the Tiltable Dock Connector?<br/></b>Yes. With our Tiltable Dock Connector your smartphone can be simply leaned against the wall. This ensures stability.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Isn't there too much weight on the FlexCharger if I load 5 devices (full flight) on it?<br/></b>This depends on your wall socket. If the wall socket is correctly fixed in the wall there should be no difficulties. We did many tests in full flight configuration and had no problems at all (..with a stable wall socket). Other than that, we installed two stabilizers to the back lower part of the casing to resist the downward tilting force and made these retractable for exact positioning on the wall.</li>
<li>
<b>USA: I have vertical outlets (power plug is turned 90°). <span><br/></span>Is FlexCharger operational with such an outlet?<br/></b>Of course. We know about this problem in the US and therefore designed a so called HOM Adapter (Horizontal Orientation Management). You can order an HOM Adapter Perk (for more information see Features), Simply swop the standard adapter for this one and FlexCharger will be operational also with horizontal outlets.</li>
<li>
<b>Is the 6.6' (2 m) retractable cable a source for problems?</b><br/>No. We integrated a really smooth running high quality automatic cable drum with a special flat cable for an easy cable spool. If you pull it out until the red mark on the cable only, it will enjoy a very long life.<br/>

</div></div>","Prototype TestingThe next step, after a long process of creativity and engineering, was testing proof of concept and functionality. We were very excited to hold FlexCharger in our hands for the very first time and to reveal to others how this unique product works and the way it was going to feel like for them, when they use it. Here are some impressions.Using Sleeves or CoversWe designed FlexCharger to be utmost flexible. So now you can also leave Sleeves or Covers on while charging. Even the Tiltable Dock Connector can be used with your smart device protection. The connector is elevated slightly so there is enough space for these difficulties and guarantees a good connection.Dear Apple UserWe would have loved to introduce ""pure"" Apple Lightning Connections to FlexCharger. We decided against this, because of the extreme costs that would occur (for you) when original Apple certified Lightnings are built in (see Apples MFI Program). We are determined to win you for FlexCharger, so we included 3 Original Certified Apple Lightning Adapters in the Perk. Nevertheless FlexCharger allows the use of adapters, so you shouldn't have difficulties. Furthermore, if we did produce an Apple Version and you or a family member changed to a non-Apple device in the future, you would then have to purchase adapters from Lightning to Micro-USB (as far as we know there are no Apple certified adapters available). Share any thoughts you might have. We'll appreciate an email from you.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style='font-family: ""Bookman Old Style"",""serif"";'>With
the dawn of another decade comes more progression. We have seen advances in
science, technology, and the arts surpass even the most wildest of dreams. Here
is one more dream. This app has been created to be the mouth piece for
Textovel.com. We can no longer ignore the fact that so many of us constantly stay busy throughout every second of the day. We drive from this
place to that, take buses and trains all over the place, and fly to cities
across the world. In order to maintain some resemblance of a personal life,
many of us use our phones and laptops to stay fresh and current with the things
we love in life that reminds us why we stay so busy in the first place. Some of
us email. Some of us browse websites. Some us write. Some of us READ. </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style='font-family: ""Bookman Old Style"",""serif"";'>Welcome
to EMoBo. It is with this app that the person always on the go can use their
phone to have a pleasurable reading and writing experience. The Japanese have
been doing this for years, but now it’s time for the rest of us to catch up.
Just click on EMoBo and you will find thousands of books ready and available
for instant download. Books will be suggested to you based on your reading
habits. If you have already started to read a book, it will be waiting for you
right on the front screen and you can pick up exactly where you left off. Even
the reading experience itself is punctual, allowing you to read your book using
different fonts, background colors, or if you want to skip ahead to the end,
it’s all with a touch of a button. Speaking of touch, you can pseudo-flip pages
from one side of your IPhone screen to the other, just like a real book. And
where do all these books come from? The ever-increasing library at TextNovel.com,
which will sync up daily with EMoBo to bring readers all the books they can
possibly want. </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style='font-family: ""Bookman Old Style"",""serif"";'>Of
course, these aren’t just any ordinary books. They are cell phone novels,
sprung from the Japanese keitai tradition. Short, to the point, poetic, crisp,
and beautiful are just a few words to describe the ALTERNATIVE STYLE OF
WRITING. Oh, and if you are a writer of these kinds of books or perhaps you
want to try writing in this powerfully concise form, there’s even a spot where
you can do that on EMoBo. Just click the icon for authors, fill out your
chapter, and update. It’s that simple. Your book will be made available for
others to download and even come up as a suggestion for others to check out if
they like your style of writing. Pretty neat huh? As me and my computer
engineer who structured EMoBo have said to each other, “we’re making progress.”

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>First of all, thank you. Thanks if you even got this far in reading everything above. We encourage you to spread the word about cell phone novels and go out and write a few yourself. Better yet, the moment this app gets written, use the app and write a novel with it and enjoy reading what others have written too. It's super convenient and seems more relevant to the way the world is going these days. Don't get me wrong, we enjoy meaty novels just like the next person, but there's something so appealing about a book that you can read fast and in the time it takes from you to ride the subway or bus to work or pick up your kids. We want to spread the power of cell phone novels to everyone who needs a convenient literary fix that's fast and fun to use. Tweet about this new style, like it on facebook when the page is up for it (due to contractual obligations, we need to wait until it's actually running before we can have this available), and most of all, support it through helping us advertise it when the app is up and running. We would gratefully appreciate it. Take care and we hope to see what everyone offers! </p>

</div></div>","Our Story

With
the dawn of another decade comes more progression. We have seen advances in
science, technology, and the arts surpass even the most wildest of dreams. Here
is one more dream. This app has been created to be the mouth piece for
Textovel.com. We can no longer ignore the fact that so many of us constantly stay busy throughout every second of the day. We drive from this
place to that, take buses and trains all over the place, and fly to cities
across the world. In order to maintain some resemblance of a personal life,
many of us use our phones and laptops to stay fresh and current with the things
we love in life that reminds us why we stay so busy in the first place. Some of
us email. Some of us browse websites. Some us write. Some of us READ. 
Welcome
to EMoBo. It is with this app that the person always on the go can use their
phone to have a pleasurable reading and writing experience. The Japanese have
been doing this for years, but now it’s time for the rest of us to catch up.
Just click on EMoBo and you will find thousands of books ready and available
for instant download. Books will be suggested to you based on your reading
habits. If you have already started to read a book, it will be waiting for you
right on the front screen and you can pick up exactly where you left off. Even
the reading experience itself is punctual, allowing you to read your book using
different fonts, background colors, or if you want to skip ahead to the end,
it’s all with a touch of a button. Speaking of touch, you can pseudo-flip pages
from one side of your IPhone screen to the other, just like a real book. And
where do all these books come from? The ever-increasing library at TextNovel.com,
which will sync up daily with EMoBo to bring readers all the books they can
possibly want. 
Of
course, these aren’t just any ordinary books. They are cell phone novels,
sprung from the Japanese keitai tradition. Short, to the point, poetic, crisp,
and beautiful are just a few words to describe the ALTERNATIVE STYLE OF
WRITING. Oh, and if you are a writer of these kinds of books or perhaps you
want to try writing in this powerfully concise form, there’s even a spot where
you can do that on EMoBo. Just click the icon for authors, fill out your
chapter, and update. It’s that simple. Your book will be made available for
others to download and even come up as a suggestion for others to check out if
they like your style of writing. Pretty neat huh? As me and my computer
engineer who structured EMoBo have said to each other, “we’re making progress.”

EMoBo-novels on the go for
people on the go. 

Benefits of Using Emobo
It's one thing to be general like we just were about emobo's place and role in the world, but let us break this down into specifics. Here is what Emobo does for you:


Benefits of using EMoBo-
A.      It’s
an alternative style of publishing.
If you are an author, what better way to show your creative abilities by
tackling a new form of writing that will allow anyone to digest your vision in
one sitting guaranteed? This is the kind of appeal necessary to promote with EMoBo’s
usage, as creative writers are always looking for new mediums to tell their
stories.
B.      It’s
simple. EMoBo
is user-friendly and doesn’t require anymore than five minutes of using before
you will become a master expert at manipulating it to do what you want. Perfect
for somebody who doesn’t have a lot of time to spend deciphering how to “apply"" the features to his or her daily needs!
C.     It’s
a natural extension for Textnovel.com.  TextNovel is a library database with strong
customer relations and a loyal following. As somebody who can be counted among
that loyal following, I must say many of us have clamored for TextNovel to
create an app that will make the uploading of stories and reading them a much
more engaging experience! Well, EMoBo allows anyone and everyone to access TextNovel’s
library plus add to it on a whim. So if you don’t have time to sit on a
computer or maybe you are in a place where pulling a laptop out just isn’t
feasible, all you have to do now is pull your phone out and Textnovel.com comes to
you. It’s beyond convenient for us text novelists!
D.   
 EMobo can do all of the following:
A.   
B.     Author’s
tool to make new novels and upload them right from their phone.
C.    Recommended
reading function, which is based on Amazon.com’s model of suggested buys. This
will allow the reader to constantly be discovering new books to read based on
their own search algorithms and also allow an author’s book to gain advertising
and exposure essentially for any book they make.
D.   Classification
of books based on categories, downloads, however text novel would like to see
the books be classified.
E.   Page
Turning function which looks cool and models after a real book.
F.   Font
resizing and white/black background for maximum reading enjoyment.
G.   Saves
the place of a last read book and displays last read book on home screen of EMoBo’s
app.
H.  
I.         Connects
with Social Networks like Facebook so you can ""Like"" and share your stories with everyone.
 

What We Need & What You Get

 The total cost of the app design is to cover the 100 or so man hours that need to be put into it. We have a prototype that we are working on and also have all the coding milestones ready to be met and just need the funding for the time to do all of them. The entire amount needing to be raised will go to these man hours being spent on coding.

<p>Anyone can visit the website, read through the posts, view the images, watch the videos, listen to the music, and even download the files. However, by simply creating a free account with just a username and an e-mail address, both of which are kept private (you can make multiple usernames with the same e-mail address FYI), or by simply connecting it to your Facebook account (again this information if kept private) you will gain access to the following features:</p>
<p>A private ""Settings"" page that allows you to upload an avatar, change the e-mail address associated with your username or change the password for your username.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>And a ""Log Out"" button to sign your username out. There is also a user friendly sticky bar that appears at the top of the screen for members giving them quick access to all of the above features.</p>
<p>When a user posts something onto <a href=""http://www.coexist2012.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Coexist2012"">Coexist2012</a>, it appears both under the ""Fresh Posts"" section of the home page and on the category page of the users choice for everyone in the world to view. This is when the anonymity part comes into play. When anyone visits <a href=""http://www.coexist2012.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Coexist2012"">Coexist2012</a> (including yourself) and views your post, they simply see the title, the content you posted (text, image, video, audio, file) and the description you added. They see nothing about the author, nor the tags, therefore leaving you completely anonymous to post whatever you so choose.</p>
<h2>Why We Are Anonymous</h2>
The word ""Anonymous"" has became a very popular buzz word due to the infamous hactivist group that goes by said name. <a href=""http://www.coexist2012.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Coexist2012"">Coexist2012</a> however is not a social network just for these hactivists.

No other social network in the world connects all of its users like <a href=""http://www.coexist2012.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Coexist2012"">Coexist2012</a>.
<h2>Why We Created Coexist2012</h2>
<p>Violations of personal privacy on many of today's leading social networking platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.) and the censhorship of news platforms (Fox, CNN, etc.) is at an all time high while completely legal websites (Megaupload, ThePirateBay, WikiLeaks) are being unlawfully persecuted by the United States government. We believe that we offer a service, the ability to anonymously socialize with the world, that is undeniably helpful and unbeatably priced, 100% free.</p>

<p>While playing Division I ball in college, and then professionally, we'd have someone video tape our swings.  With technology the way it is, people are visually oriented more so than having someone tell you what to do.  Watching yourself perform is a very effective way to identify what's working and what's not.  Simple things like how my stance looked, where was I holding my hands, or what did my swing path through the ball look like.  Funny how all the little things effect how far the ball goes and its path.  The most frustrating thing about video training in college was all the waiting and scheduling time to watch recorded videos.  Plus, there was only so much time you could spend with the coach before it was time for the next player to view his swing.  I wanted to take my swing footage with me for further analysis.  That's when it occurred to me.  I needed to build a mobile tool for my phone that did this so I could carry videos around and watch them whenever I wanted.  We'll, that's our Golf Coach Pro Mobile App.  An easy to use, simple tool that allows you to capture and compare your performance.  You can analize your best swings and compare them to your performance on any given day.  And when you need guidance, you can download professional swings for use as a training guide.  The bottom line is ""it works, and it works great""!</p>
<p>As the founder and CEO of Athletic Improvement Company, our vision is to support fellow athletes with easy to use, reliable, affordable, sports improvement mobile technologies.  As a collegiate Division 1 and professional athlete, our quality is insured by the simple fact that our products are  ""developed by the player, for the player"".  Golf is one of my passions.  To check out the quality of our products, check out two previously released sports specific Apps - Baseball Swing Trainer iRake by visiting its website at <a href=""http://www.iRake-App.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.iRake-App.com</a>, and Softball Hitting Coach by visiting its website at <a href=""http://www.SoftballHittingCoachApp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.SoftballHittingCoachApp.com</a>, or visit Apple's iTunes Store and type in the key words: Baseball iRake and/or Softball Hitting Coach.  We have many more sports specific Apps on the drawing board.</p>
<p>As a 24 year old college graduate and professional, I believe in sports, and the life style, quality of life, sense of purpose, and relationships it builds. My passion is to give back to the sporting community with something I know works.  I want this App in the hands of the youth of America, and I need your financial support in making this happen.  We've priced our Apps for less than the cost of a hot dog and coke.  Our Golf Coach Pro Mobile App wasn't our first App, and won't be our last.  Your finalcial support will be greatly appreciated in making this happen.</p>

<p><img alt=""Cloud ecosystem"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wimoto.com/images/Cloud%20ecosystem.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Cloud ecosystem""/></p>
<p>Wimotos are a family of small, wireless sensors for your iPhone, iPad, Android, Linux or Raspberry Pi device that measure environmentals such as ambient temperature, humidity, light, soil moisture, soil temperature, object temperature, human presence and movement. They last for about a year on a single battery and don't require an Internet connection to work. </p>
<p>You can upload your data to our cloud service for analysis via our free app, or use the optional Wimoto Cloud Cube to do it for you in realtime via Wifi.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>
<br/><img alt=""Climote"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wimoto.com/images//Climote.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Climote""/><br/><span><img alt=""climote in nursery"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wimoto.com/images/indiegogo/nursery.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""climote in nursery""/></span>
</h3>
<p>Instead of launching a weather app, wouldn't it be nice to know what the weather right outside your home is right now? Or if it's too dry or cold at night in your baby's bedroom? Or how long it take my fridge to cool down every time the door is opened? Or if my cigars turning to dust in my humidor? Or if that bottle of vintage wine is turning to vinegar in the basement? Or if my compost heap has finished its aerobic reaction?...</p>
<p>The Climote has literally hundreds of uses where you need precision temperature, humidity and light information. Like all motes, it records this information to its built-in memory when you're not around and can send you alerts when a minimum or maximum threshold is exceeded. You can even upload your mote's data to our cloud service to analyze it or export it to your own applications.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>
<img alt=""Growmote"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wimoto.com/images/Growmote.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Growmote""/> <br/><span><img alt=""Growmote in pansies"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wimoto.com/images/indiegogo/Growmote%20in%20pansies.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Growmote in pansies""/></span>
</h3>
<p>The Growmote measures the amount of water available in the soil surrounding the roots of a plant. the level of light available for growing, and even soil temperature to protect against frost. Unlike other devices on the market, they're economical enough to have several of and can 'push' alerts such as ""I need water"" directly to your smart device.</p>
<p>Imagine coming home from work, and your lawn telling you that it needs to be watered?<br/><br/><br/><img alt=""Thermote"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wimoto.com/images/Thermote.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Thermote""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/13954/files/20130815092921-custom-swimming-pool.jpg?1376584161"" src="""" style=""width: 556.0421052631579px; height: 372px;""/></p>
<p><span>The Thermote doesn't measure the air temperature or even use a probe: it measures the temperature of an object just by being pointed at it! The techno-jargon for this is ""infrared emissivitiy"". In practical terms, it means that the mote:thermo doesn't need to be touching the object you want to measure the temperature of -- just point and measure!</span></p>
<p>This makes it great for measuring the temperature of the water in your hot tub or swimming pool or aquarium, your body tempature (via your temporal area), food, or anything else you might not want to stick a traditional temperature probe into for reasons of hygiene, comfort or practicality. </p>
<p>Because it's tiny and can easily be stuck to an iPad or iPhone, you can even turn your iPad or iPhone into a portable contactless thermomter!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>As we've now exceeded our original funding goal, we're able to introduce the...</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Secrimote"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wimoto.com/images/indiegogo/securimote"" src="""" style="""" title=""Securimote""/></p>
<p>The Securimote has a passive infrared motoion sensor that detects human movement up to around 5m/16ft away. It also has an onboard acceleromter, so it can detect if it's moved. Use it to notify you if someone is approaching your front door, if your toddler has climbed out of his bed again in the middle of the night, or that the mail is delivered -- the possibilites are enedless!<br/><br/></p>
<h2><span>A Great Looking App</span></h2>
<p><img alt=""Wimoto app mote:climate screen"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wimoto.com/images/indiegogo/wimoto%20app%20iPhone%205%20main%20screen.png"" src="""" style=""""/> <img alt=""Wimoto mote:app sidebar"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wimoto.com/images/indiegogo/wimoto%20app%20iPhone%205%20sidebar.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our app features a minimalist deisgn and works with the whole range of Motes -- no need to launch separate apps for each type. Simple ""sparkline"" graphing is available on your iPhone and iPad to indicate trends and data can easily be uplaoded to the cloud service for more detailed graphing and data export with the click of an icon.</p>
<p>Signal strength and battery life for each Mote is displayed whilst that Mote is selected.</p>
<p>We will have an Android version of the app for Android 4.3 devices in June or July of 2013, although this is dependant on Google releasing Anrdoid 4.3 with a fully supported version of the Broadcom Bluetooth 4.0 stack. Only devices that have the necessary hardware (most Samsung devices, Google Nexus, etc.) will be compatible -- please ask if you're unsure if your device will be supported.</p>

<br/><span>Common Features Of All Motes</span>

<h2><span>Technical Specifications</span></h2>
<h2><strong><img alt=""Technical Specs"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wimoto.com/images/indiegogo/Slide1.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Technical Specs""/></strong></h2>
<h2><span>How We'll Use The Money Raised and the Risks and Challenges</span></h2>
<p>We've spent a long time developing our technology, going through various prototypes, developing the iOS app, putting together the beta of our cloud service, and more. We're almost at the pre-production stage, but we need your help to make the first production run a reality.</p>
<p><img alt=""Mote prototype PCB"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wimoto.com/images/indiegogo/Mote%20prototype%20assembly.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mote prototype PCB""/></p>
<p>We'll use the funds raised for the following major tasks:</p>
<h3>Plastic Enclosure Moulding</h3>
<p>Even a seemingly simple plastic part can actually have a very expensive and complicated mould. These moulds sometimes cost tens of thousands and sometimes even hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Rather than have a custom enclosure for each Mote, we've opted to use one basic design that can be post-machined using a CNC. This saves time, money and reduces risk -- it's a lot easier to adjust machining a hole on a generic design than having to redesign the entire mould if the hole is completely wrong. </p>
<p>We've worked with Protomold, a company that specializes in prototpye and short run injection moulding, to design an enclosure that is both functional and economical. Using CAD models they have identified potential issues with our designs *before* manufacturing and therefore we are confident we have mitigated any expensive issues before starting production.</p>
<h3>Regulatory Testing</h3>
<p>Because Motes are both tiny computers and wirelessly communicate with a smartphone, tablet or computer, they require regulatory testing and approval.</p>
<p>To ensure that we get Bluetooth complance approval we've worked with the manufacturer of the Bluetooth SMART system-on-a-chip we're using to ensure we follow their best pratices. We've also reused their reference design for the complicated radio portion, which also means we're assured compliance approval from the Bluetooth oversight body -- Bluetooth SIG. </p>
<p>We have partnered with a testing facility that will perform our FCC (USA), Industry Canada (Canada) and CE (Europe) radio frequency emissions testing and provide consulting advice in the unlikely event we are not compliant. </p>
<h3>Electronics Assembly and Fulfillment </h3>
<p><span>One of the biggest challenges with producing a product is getting every part of it made, put together and ready for shipping.</span></p>
<p>For electronics our electronics, we have a worked with a contract manufacturer who will take on the procurement of most of the parts, manufacturing of the printed circuit boards, assembly of the printed circuit boards and the testing of the completed electronics sub-assemblies. </p>
<p>But it's not economically feasible to do the above everytime we get a single order -- we need to order in bulk (1,000 Motes or more) to make it practical.</p>
<p> </p>

How they’re used is totally up to you, but they make it easy with 1-year battery life, water-resistant casings, wireless connectivity, two types of included mounting materials, plus an app that brings it all together.""</em> - <a href=""http://www.gearhungry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>GearHungry</strong></a> </p>

Wimotos are a family of small, wireless sensors for your iPhone, iPad, Android, Linux or Raspberry Pi device that measure environmentals such as ambient temperature, humidity, light, soil moisture, soil temperature, object temperature, human presence and movement. They last for about a year on a single battery and don't require an Internet connection to work. 
You can upload your data to our cloud service for analysis via our free app, or use the optional Wimoto Cloud Cube to do it for you in realtime via Wifi.
 
 



Instead of launching a weather app, wouldn't it be nice to know what the weather right outside your home is right now? Or if it's too dry or cold at night in your baby's bedroom? Or how long it take my fridge to cool down every time the door is opened? Or if my cigars turning to dust in my humidor? Or if that bottle of vintage wine is turning to vinegar in the basement? Or if my compost heap has finished its aerobic reaction?...
The Climote has literally hundreds of uses where you need precision temperature, humidity and light information. Like all motes, it records this information to its built-in memory when you're not around and can send you alerts when a minimum or maximum threshold is exceeded. You can even upload your mote's data to our cloud service to analyze it or export it to your own applications.

 

The Growmote measures the amount of water available in the soil surrounding the roots of a plant. the level of light available for growing, and even soil temperature to protect against frost. Unlike other devices on the market, they're economical enough to have several of and can 'push' alerts such as ""I need water"" directly to your smart device.
Imagine coming home from work, and your lawn telling you that it needs to be watered?


The Thermote doesn't measure the air temperature or even use a probe: it measures the temperature of an object just by being pointed at it! The techno-jargon for this is ""infrared emissivitiy"". In practical terms, it means that the mote:thermo doesn't need to be touching the object you want to measure the temperature of -- just point and measure!
This makes it great for measuring the temperature of the water in your hot tub or swimming pool or aquarium, your body tempature (via your temporal area), food, or anything else you might not want to stick a traditional temperature probe into for reasons of hygiene, comfort or practicality. 
Because it's tiny and can easily be stuck to an iPad or iPhone, you can even turn your iPad or iPhone into a portable contactless thermomter!
 
As we've now exceeded our original funding goal, we're able to introduce the...

The Securimote has a passive infrared motoion sensor that detects human movement up to around 5m/16ft away. It also has an onboard acceleromter, so it can detect if it's moved. Use it to notify you if someone is approaching your front door, if your toddler has climbed out of his bed again in the middle of the night, or that the mail is delivered -- the possibilites are enedless!
A Great Looking App
 
Our app features a minimalist deisgn and works with the whole range of Motes -- no need to launch separate apps for each type. Simple ""sparkline"" graphing is available on your iPhone and iPad to indicate trends and data can easily be uplaoded to the cloud service for more detailed graphing and data export with the click of an icon.
Signal strength and battery life for each Mote is displayed whilst that Mote is selected.
We will have an Android version of the app for Android 4.3 devices in June or July of 2013, although this is dependant on Google releasing Anrdoid 4.3 with a fully supported version of the Broadcom Bluetooth 4.0 stack. Only devices that have the necessary hardware (most Samsung devices, Google Nexus, etc.) will be compatible -- please ask if you're unsure if your device will be supported.

Common Features Of All Motes


Technical Specifications

How We'll Use The Money Raised and the Risks and Challenges
We've spent a long time developing our technology, going through various prototypes, developing the iOS app, putting together the beta of our cloud service, and more. We're almost at the pre-production stage, but we need your help to make the first production run a reality.

We'll use the funds raised for the following major tasks:
Plastic Enclosure Moulding
Even a seemingly simple plastic part can actually have a very expensive and complicated mould. These moulds sometimes cost tens of thousands and sometimes even hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Rather than have a custom enclosure for each Mote, we've opted to use one basic design that can be post-machined using a CNC. This saves time, money and reduces risk -- it's a lot easier to adjust machining a hole on a generic design than having to redesign the entire mould if the hole is completely wrong. 
We've worked with Protomold, a company that specializes in prototpye and short run injection moulding, to design an enclosure that is both functional and economical. Using CAD models they have identified potential issues with our designs *before* manufacturing and therefore we are confident we have mitigated any expensive issues before starting production.
Regulatory Testing
Because Motes are both tiny computers and wirelessly communicate with a smartphone, tablet or computer, they require regulatory testing and approval.
To ensure that we get Bluetooth complance approval we've worked with the manufacturer of the Bluetooth SMART system-on-a-chip we're using to ensure we follow their best pratices. We've also reused their reference design for the complicated radio portion, which also means we're assured compliance approval from the Bluetooth oversight body -- Bluetooth SIG. 
We have partnered with a testing facility that will perform our FCC (USA), Industry Canada (Canada) and CE (Europe) radio frequency emissions testing and provide consulting advice in the unlikely event we are not compliant. 
Electronics Assembly and Fulfillment 
One of the biggest challenges with producing a product is getting every part of it made, put together and ready for shipping.
For electronics our electronics, we have a worked with a contract manufacturer who will take on the procurement of most of the parts, manufacturing of the printed circuit boards, assembly of the printed circuit boards and the testing of the completed electronics sub-assemblies. 
But it's not economically feasible to do the above everytime we get a single order -- we need to order in bulk (1,000 Motes or more) to make it practical.
 
Press Coverage
""Whether you are a gardener or just had a baby, you will be alerted of changes in the environment with the Motes sensor. This is an affordable product that is durable, simple, and has a great app to go with it. Motes has doubled its goal on Indiegogo!"" - The Crowdfund Mafia
""Notifications keep us appraised of email, Twitter and overall social presence, but what about the real world? That’s where Motes come in. These tiny 1×1-inch sensors keep tabs on their local environment, detecting either temperature, humidity and light (Climote), object temperature via infrared (Thermote), motion plus movement thanks to an accelerometer and infrared sensor (Securimote), or light exposure and soil humidity of a plant (Growmote). How they’re used is totally up to you, but they make it easy with 1-year battery life, water-resistant casings, wireless connectivity, two types of included mounting materials, plus an app that brings it all together."" - GearHungry

<p>iSunCLOUD was invented for growing need of cloud storage in the world. If we look at the incumbent cloud solutions in the market, each solution has some sort of problems, for instance, they can be <b>costly, unreliable or slow. </b></p><p>That is why we created iSunCLOUD, a <b>shared economy (P2P) cloud storage system</b>. iSunCLOUD shares the “share” concept of Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb. Instead of renting storage space from multi-billion dollar companies such as Apple or Dropbox, iSunCLOUD allows you to <b>rent out</b> your<b> own storage</b> in your existing PC(s) or any devices with storage function to<b> people who need extra storage</b>. Like any other share economy platforms, users can receive a payment in return. </p>
<h2>Why do we need you?</h2><p></p><p>Our talented team has been working in developing iSunCLOUD since 2014. We are now in our final stage of testing the mutual cloud system. Similar to any other P2P network, the number of users and the stability of users’ activity are critical. In our testing, we found the typical PCs we use are not the most cost effective way to fully enjoy the benefits of iSunCLOUD. While it is true that PC users can access or connect to the cloud anytime, the cost of electricity maybe high to host it for 24/7.</p><p>That is why we are starting this crowdfunding campaign for iSunNODE (the node). iSunNODEis a device as a foundation for our P2P network. The node can perform complex encryption and sustain the heavy P2P network traffic. In additional, the node can be an entertainment center featured with nearly all typical functions performed by your home electronic products.</p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">What is </span><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">ISunNODE</b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">?</span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Ff_3rYoezvcs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Df_3rYoezvcs&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Ff_3rYoezvcs%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450421267/ylsguwbgabyfa5tzykhl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>iSunNODE is the foundation for iSunCLOUD.

<h3>How does ISunNODE work?</h3>
<h4>Personal Server: </h4>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Upload a file into your iSunNODE</li>
<li>Now you have access of the file anywhere in the world</li>
<li>Each time you download the file, it comes directly from your home server. NO COPY ON THE CLOUD, we value your privacy.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Join and Be Part of iSunCLOUD:</h4>
<div><ol>
<li>Pick a contribution size of your storage</li>
<li>Pick a safety level that you prefer: Level 2- Level 10.
     Each level represents how many copies of the file we keep on the
     decentralized cloud. </li>
<li>Depending on your safety level, your internet bandwidth
     demand for storage, you will be assigned a conversion ratio.   Your
     conversion ratio is most likely to be the same as safety level.</li>
<li>If your conversion ratio is 3, for each 300MB you
     contribute, you have 100MB cloud space. </li>
<li>After you upload the file, the file is shredded into
     units of 100KB, each unit is copied 3 times*, and then saved in nodes
     across the network. (*assuming your safety level is same as conversion
     ratio) </li>
<li>If you need your file from the cloud, the file will
     arrive in seconds. By sourcing your file from multiple nodes and leverage
     on P2P technology, your download speed will be blazing fast.</li>

The next generation of cloud making full use of your storage



iSunCLOUD was invented for growing need of cloud storage in the world. If we look at the incumbent cloud solutions in the market, each solution has some sort of problems, for instance, they can be costly, unreliable or slow. That is why we created iSunCLOUD, a shared economy (P2P) cloud storage system. iSunCLOUD shares the “share” concept of Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb. Instead of renting storage space from multi-billion dollar companies such as Apple or Dropbox, iSunCLOUD allows you to rent out your own storage in your existing PC(s) or any devices with storage function to people who need extra storage. Like any other share economy platforms, users can receive a payment in return. 
Why do we need you?Our talented team has been working in developing iSunCLOUD since 2014. We are now in our final stage of testing the mutual cloud system. Similar to any other P2P network, the number of users and the stability of users’ activity are critical. In our testing, we found the typical PCs we use are not the most cost effective way to fully enjoy the benefits of iSunCLOUD. While it is true that PC users can access or connect to the cloud anytime, the cost of electricity maybe high to host it for 24/7.That is why we are starting this crowdfunding campaign for iSunNODE (the node). iSunNODEis a device as a foundation for our P2P network. The node can perform complex encryption and sustain the heavy P2P network traffic. In additional, the node can be an entertainment center featured with nearly all typical functions performed by your home electronic products.What is ISunNODE?iSunNODE is the foundation for iSunCLOUD. It’s a hardware that can do many things. We designed iSunNODE to be a media center for all your electronics’ data. After many researches, we think this device is best fit to a big screen, your TV. You may use the TV to read the content in the cloud or in the node. Besides, we don’t want to design a device that just Does One thing, we want the node to fit anywhere and everywhere, that is why we designed the device to support Dual CPUs and of course, with many functions.
Processors: System CPU: 1.5GHz Octa Core (Android or Windows) + 2G RAM; Router CPU: Dedicated Router CPU 880MHZ 
Storage: 8G SSD and Up to 8TB Hard drive
Wireless:  Bluetooth 4.0, WIFI 802.11 AC Up to 1300mbps
I/O: HDMI 2.0 (4K 60FPS), LAN & WAN, Optical Audio, USB 2.0*5, USB3.0*1
Benefit of Dual CPU:
Remove interference between two major tasks from the hardware level (router task vs system task).
Specialized task for specialized CPU - System CPU runs system tasks, such as Android APP, TV APP, Windows System, Play Movie. Router CPU dedicated for traffic control, making sure the best performance for all connected devices at home.

iSunNODE +iSunCLOUD = Things iSunNODE can do
You can do many things with iSunNODE when you combine iSunNODE with iSunCLOUD.1.  Personal Server
We think people should have all photos, videos and other data in a personal server inside their home, so that every time people want to retrieve the data, they will not have to download it from the internet.2.  Private Cloud
Our goal is to create a cloud that are just next to you no matter where you are. Since your files are stored in our decentralized network, we can move your files to the nodes near you no matter where you are in the world. 


3.  Free for Lifetime (If you contribute)
iSunCLOUDis built on a P2P network. We back up all files in our decentralized cloud. In order to use the P2P cloud space for free, you can contribute a portion of your local storage space in exchange for other’s storage space.


4.  Safe! Safe ! & Safe !

Our cloud use “shred and disperse” technology. Each file that you upload will be cut into pieces and disperse all over the network. No one other than yourself can piece the file together.


5.  Potential income 
Contributors may able to receive income, if their space where used by users who pay for the spaces instead of exchanging with their own space.




6 . Media Consumption Most of the TV boxes today have you streamed your contents from a mobile. Streaming from phone may lead to temporary suspension of work of your phone. iSunCLOUD seamlessly backup and store your videos, data on your node. The next time you are ""streaming"" a 4K video that you shoot from your phone to the TV, it can be played from the node without a lag or drop frame.




Advantage of running a iSunCLOUD on iSunNODE than a PC
Lower Power Consumption - 10% of a normal tower PC's power consumption


Small Form Factor that fit everywhere in the home





How does ISunNODE work?
Personal Server: 


Upload a file into your iSunNODE
Now you have access of the file anywhere in the world
Each time you download the file, it comes directly from your home server. NO COPY ON THE CLOUD, we value your privacy.

Join and Be Part of iSunCLOUD:

Pick a contribution size of your storage
Pick a safety level that you prefer: Level 2- Level 10.
     Each level represents how many copies of the file we keep on the
     decentralized cloud. 
Depending on your safety level, your internet bandwidth
     demand for storage, you will be assigned a conversion ratio.   Your
     conversion ratio is most likely to be the same as safety level.
If your conversion ratio is 3, for each 300MB you
     contribute, you have 100MB cloud space. 
After you upload the file, the file is shredded into
     units of 100KB, each unit is copied 3 times*, and then saved in nodes
     across the network. (*assuming your safety level is same as conversion
     ratio) 
If you need your file from the cloud, the file will
     arrive in seconds. By sourcing your file from multiple nodes and leverage
     on P2P technology, your download speed will be blazing fast.



Which One Should I Get? 



They can all be your Home Media Center, TV box, Mini PC, Gaming Box. Their difference are 


ISunNODE Clean - If you have an idle drive at home, or you just want a powerful mini PC that one day it can be your home personal private cloud. This is your choice. 
ISunNODE 2TB - If you are looking for a personal private server to use at home or work, 2TB will be enough for your personal daily usage.  In addition, the 2TB will be sufficient for personal data and media usage. Use 2TB with a TV, you will not only be able to stream 4K video on TV, but also store the video in the node. 

ISunNODE 4TB - If you like the speed, safety and convenience of the iSunCLOUD, 4TB node will do the job. iSunNODE 4TB has all the benefits of 2TB as well as potentially get you free usage for life by contributing certain % of the storage. 


ISunNODE8TB - 8TB is the BEST,  the 8TB Node will be the cornerstone of our network. 8TB will not only satisfy your daily need, but also save up store credits for future uses of the iSunCLOUD.



Clouds Comparison: 



By utilizing your own hard drives, you may use iSunCLOUD for free for life! By contributing to the network, you may get unlimited of cloud space. Of course, the size of your cloud is determined by your contribution.

<h2>How this came to be</h2>
<p>     </p>
<p>Hi I'm Brandon Lyons, a 29-year-old single father to a beautiful 5-year-old daughter. I have worked really hard to be an active part of my daughter's life. Two years ago, in late 2011 I found myself in a situation where my daughter's mother was trying to take away the quality time my daughter and I were used to having together. The prospect of losing this quality time was horrifying. I was working as a low-wage construction worker, had my daughter the majority of the time while still paying child support, but I was so happy to have her full time that I didn't want to open up that can of worms with her mother. I was optimistic enough to think that one day things would change naturally for the better.</p>
<p>When my daughter's mother was finished with school she came to me and told me that my time with my daughter was going to be reduced to every other weekend and she wanted more child support. I wasn't keeping a record of how often I had my daughter because I never expected to face this; and when the child support case came I never thought they would increase my payment from $375 to $785 based purely on the fact that her mother said that she was going to file a new parenting plan that gave me every other weekend. When the child support case results came I was shocked. It took 4 weeks to hear the court decision and during that time frame I still had my daughter the majority of the time. Something had to be done but with no cash or credit resources to afford a lawyer my options were looking slim and scary. I set up meetings with lawyers but without money that was a no-go and then I contacted a firm that would fill out the paperwork needed for court, only to find out that they still cost in excess of $2000 just for the paperwork.</p>
<p> Although I was extremely let down by these two paths they did both offer me one solid piece of advice as well as one harsh truth. The advice was to keep track of how often I had my daughter and the expenses that I incurred on a monthly basis as well as try my very best to backtrack my prior time spent. That was something other parents advised me to do as well. The harsh truth is that because I wasn’t the custodial parent it was going to be an extremely hard case to win. I immediately starting implementing their advice; looking back to figure out the precise times I had her in the past proved beyond difficult, but not impossible. I also started to research the outcomes of cases similar to mine and it didn’t comfort me one bit.  In fact it made me sick to find out how many great mothers and fathers had been run over and there was a direct cause: flawed laws and parents that abused the system for their own personal gain. It got me so fired up that I decided to make an organization aimed at protecting the great mothers and fathers that deserve to be partners in the raising of their children.</p>
<p> I hit the books, started networking, met with law makers, and did the only thing that my finances could support--filling out the paperwork and representing myself in court. This wasn’t easy and I wanted to give up many times, but my daughter always motivated me to keep going. Here I was working full time, being a full-time father, working on getting my organization going and getting ready to represent myself in court. The paperwork alone was a huge task.  It involved over one hundred pages and took me filling out the wrong paperwork in its entirety four times to get it right.  Talk about frustration but I did end up getting it right. I was so busy that I was lucky to get 3-4 hours of sleep a night.</p>
<p> While I was doing all this it was incredibly difficult to keep track of how often I had my daughter on a daily basis. I often found myself trying to think back to what exactly the schedule had been for the previous two weeks. This pattern continued for about another month until I thought “there has to be an app for this,” and so the search began. After a couple weeks of searching I was extremely disappointed that I had not yet found what I was looking for. As I was sitting down trying to remember my schedule for the last week it hit me, why doesn’t the app I had dreamt about exist? An app that not only conveniently helps parents keep track of scheduling and expenses but would also help parents get the free resources they would ordinarily have to spend days or weeks on Google trying to find, an app that can help them contact helpful non-profits in their area, an app that would help to increase the unity and the cooperation from organization to organization. From that moment I saw the vision of what an app like this can do for the movement and I set forth making my vision a reality.</p>
<p> I didn’t have the resources to put this all together so I made a business plan and started approaching the banks. I remember the first time I e-mailed my 20 page business plan and the spelling and grammar was so bad that the response email literally contained laughter “hahahahaha have you prof read this” followed by everything incorrect being highlighted in red which was 90% of everything. This didn’t discourage me at all. Instead I corrected everything and turned that business plan from 20 to about 40 pages, turned it back and got a response back that it needed more specifics and information. I continued this back and forth routine and face to face meetings 40-50 more times with banks until I was left with a 200 plus page business plan and the recognition that banks would never loan me the money to a 500 credit score, $1,200/month income father like myself so I took the business plan that I had perfected and went in search of private investment. That path seemed impossible because none of my friends and family had the resources. If they did I likely would have been able to hire a lawyer for court, so needless to say those resources didn’t exist within my friends and family aside from the $300 dollars that I was really fortunate to receive from my grandma and the room and board my parents provided me.</p>
<p> Because my daughter and other people were counting on me, failure was not an option. Over the next few months I contacted over 150 people via phone and email, and met with over 40 people in person to give my pitch and each sharpened my ability and resolve to get this done, until one day I finally heard the yes I longed for! I was able to get enough funds to build the basic app for Android and it has been an amazing, lesson-learning ride.  After over 6 months of development our first app, Dadmom is about to launch. This app is going to be a powerful tool for parents to keep record of scheduling and expenses. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to add the other side of equally valuable features that I also still hoped to make a completely separate free application to make sure everyone can use these resources.  That’s why I’m here, to bring the entirety of this vision to fruition.</p>
<p>I am striving to bring a vision of fairness, transparency, accountability and accuracy to the family law system. A vision of parents being able to easily find the resources they desperately need, a vision of no good parent having to give all their quality family time, sleep, dreams, and money (borrowed or otherwise) just to get what is right out of family law. I’ve come too far to turn back, and I’m laser focused on making this a reality. It’s time we make a positive change for families by changing the way family law is practiced. Thanks so much for checking out my cause, I’m so grateful for everything we get for this cause, especially your support! </p>
<br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am hoping to raise $30,000 to go entirely towards enhanced software development. I currently have the base software functionality developed for the android platform; any money raised beyond our goal will go towards expanding availability to other platforms such as Apple and Windows. If we do not reach our goal then we will use the capital raised to complete the task in the following order. </p>
<p><b>Where the funds are going</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Dynamic unifying organization to organization connecting</li>
<li>Specific state by state information </li>
<li>Organized petitioning </li>
<li>More crisp and modern design</li>
<li>Parent to parent resources and media sharing</li>
<li>A second and completely free app that provides parents valuable resources</li>
<li><span>Lay out the ground works for court integration</span></li>
<li><span><p>Enhanced security</p>
<br/></span></li>
</ol>
<br/><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to this cause you are helping to take this great nation one big leap towards adding fairness through transparency, accuracy, and accountability. We've never had the ability to have a dynamic system that makes it extremely convenient for parents to keep custody and expense information until now. It’s time the family law system utilizes it to make a far better system that protects the many great parents that are negatively affected by the way the system is currently set up. The family law revolution starts here! </p>
<p>Not only will users be able to easily find local legal resources, non-profits and other organizations by simply using the Dadmom app, they will also be able to use the convenience of today's technology to help parents keep track of their child's expenses and how often they have them for legal, budgeting and/or other purposes. By using DadMom software, parents will be able to take date, time and location encrypted pictures, videos and receipt barcode by simply opening the DadMom app from their smart phone, tablet or computer and following a couple quick and easy steps. Users are able to set custom alarms and reminders to make a quick record of having their child or store their expense information. DadMom organizes the information into an easy-to-read and understandable legal format that can be exported to present to the court. The Dadmom app provides automatic uploading to a secure online database to ensure the information is accessible and safe. It will have many more features such as activity ideas, forums, classified ads, blogs, surveys, contests, prizes, important child medical information, interactive connections to social media, online parenting classes along with custom call and text recording.</p>
<br/><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>All the work I do stems from the passion I have for helping people. Over the last couple years I have dedicated all my free time to the parental equality movement. I’m passionate about helping the great parents that deserve to be an equal part in the raising of their child’s life, most do not have the financial resources to protect themselves in the family court. I run an organization were many of us don’t have the financial resources to sponsor this project but they provide something far more valuable, support, spreading the word and feedback in making sure the changes we seek are ones that will entire benefit of most import members of our society, our children! If you don’t have money don’t worry because your support in far more valuable, please help get the word out and connect with we on Facebook at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/bfffr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/bfffr</a> and twitter <a href=""https://twitter.com/DadMomEquality."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://twitter.com/DadMomEquality.</a> Get to know me, watch my video’s and feel my heart and if you support what I’m about then please like/follow me and tell you friends about this project.

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to add the other side of equally valuable features that I also still hoped to make a completely separate free application to make sure everyone can use these resources.  That’s why I’m here, to bring the entirety of this vision to fruition.
I am striving to bring a vision of fairness, transparency, accountability and accuracy to the family law system. A vision of parents being able to easily find the resources they desperately need, a vision of no good parent having to give all their quality family time, sleep, dreams, and money (borrowed or otherwise) just to get what is right out of family law. I’ve come too far to turn back, and I’m laser focused on making this a reality. It’s time we make a positive change for families by changing the way family law is practiced. Thanks so much for checking out my cause, I’m so grateful for everything we get for this cause, especially your support! 
What We Need & What You Get
I am hoping to raise $30,000 to go entirely towards enhanced software development. I currently have the base software functionality developed for the android platform; any money raised beyond our goal will go towards expanding availability to other platforms such as Apple and Windows. If we do not reach our goal then we will use the capital raised to complete the task in the following order. 
Where the funds are going

Dynamic unifying organization to organization connecting
Specific state by state information 
Organized petitioning 
More crisp and modern design
Parent to parent resources and media sharing
A second and completely free app that provides parents valuable resources
Lay out the ground works for court integration
Enhanced security


The Impact
By contributing to this cause you are helping to take this great nation one big leap towards adding fairness through transparency, accuracy, and accountability. We've never had the ability to have a dynamic system that makes it extremely convenient for parents to keep custody and expense information until now. It’s time the family law system utilizes it to make a far better system that protects the many great parents that are negatively affected by the way the system is currently set up. The family law revolution starts here! 
Not only will users be able to easily find local legal resources, non-profits and other organizations by simply using the Dadmom app, they will also be able to use the convenience of today's technology to help parents keep track of their child's expenses and how often they have them for legal, budgeting and/or other purposes. By using DadMom software, parents will be able to take date, time and location encrypted pictures, videos and receipt barcode by simply opening the DadMom app from their smart phone, tablet or computer and following a couple quick and easy steps. Users are able to set custom alarms and reminders to make a quick record of having their child or store their expense information. DadMom organizes the information into an easy-to-read and understandable legal format that can be exported to present to the court. The Dadmom app provides automatic uploading to a secure online database to ensure the information is accessible and safe. It will have many more features such as activity ideas, forums, classified ads, blogs, surveys, contests, prizes, important child medical information, interactive connections to social media, online parenting classes along with custom call and text recording.
Other Ways You Can Help
All the work I do stems from the passion I have for helping people. Over the last couple years I have dedicated all my free time to the parental equality movement. I’m passionate about helping the great parents that deserve to be an equal part in the raising of their child’s life, most do not have the financial resources to protect themselves in the family court. I run an organization were many of us don’t have the financial resources to sponsor this project but they provide something far more valuable, support, spreading the word and feedback in making sure the changes we seek are ones that will entire benefit of most import members of our society, our children! If you don’t have money don’t worry because your support in far more valuable, please help get the word out and connect with we on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/bfffr and twitter https://twitter.com/DadMomEquality. Get to know me, watch my video’s and feel my heart and if you support what I’m about then please like/follow me and tell you friends about this project. I owe everything to the men and women that have shown their belief in me, from the bottom of my heart thank you!

<br/><h4>Proper current charging rate: not all chargers are created equal, even if they look similar.</h4>
<p>Terminology – amps, milliamps and amperage.</p>
<p>First off let’s explain some terms. An amp is a measure of how much electrical charge is passing through a point in a given time. The higher the number of amps the faster your device can charge. The abbreviation for amp is A. </p>
<p>The important thing to realise is that different chargers can charge at very different rates, despite having the same connector. Bigger and more powerful devices will require chargers that operate at a higher amount of amps.</p>
<p>For example, a small iPod Nano might require 0.5A to charge, a medium-size iPhone will require 1.1A, and a large iPad will require 2.1A. If you try to charge an iPad using an iPhone charger, you will find that it charges much more slowly or doesn’t charge at all!</p>
<p>The other way around isn’t as much of a problem. If you try to charge an iPhone (1.1A) using an iPad charger (2.1A), then the iPhone will just charge at 1.1A, although it might get a little hotter than normal. Even if you charge an iPod Nano (0.5A) with an iPad charger (2.1A), nothing bad will happen.</p>
<p>If you buy a new charger, it’s important to ensure that you get one that provides at least as much amperage as your device needs.</p>
<p>Bad USB charger Bad USB charger Note: Some devices like the iPhone will only draw up to 1.1A of current no matter the charger.</p>
<p>If you use a high amp on your device you’re not going to blow up your phone or anything crazy like that. And the myth that charging your device at a faster rate will reduce the life of your device’s battery is false. For some older devices, the higher specced charger just won’t work at all, while newer devices will just charge faster.</p>
<h3>
<b>Once you’ve got the right charger for your gadget, the next consideration is the power source.</b> </h3>
<p>While most outputs provide enough power, some – like the USB port on a computer – won’t provide enough, even if you’re using the perfect charger.</p>
<p>If you’re using a wall socket, there’s more than enough power on tap to charge any mobile device – up to 13A. It’s a similar situation in a car’s cigarette lighter socket, which typically provides up to 12A.</p>
<p>USB ports that you’d find on a computer are a little more complicated. Standard USB ports will only provide 500 mA, but there are also special high power USB ports that provide up to 1500 mA. However, it’s difficult to know which is which at a glance.</p>
<p>Generally, the most important thing to remember is to use wall outlets and cigarette sockets when you can, and USB as a last resort.</p>

<h3>Onix Cable by TEGIC </h3>
<p>A versatile multifunction cable that can charge all of your trending electronic devices. It supports USB Type-C to Type-C with USB-A and lightning connectors available on each side.</p>
<p>———————————————————— —— —— —— —— —— </p>
<p>Before introducing this cable, I would like to first share with you TEGIC's slogan:  “<strong>No more Micro USB</strong>.” </p>
<p>So I am sorry to inform you that this cable doesn't support Micro USB. Then here goes our story of Onix Cable. </p>
<p>As new digital devices flood into the market at lightning speed, I have often found myself lost among all kinds of cables and chargers that match different devices. The chaos really bothers me. </p>
<p>My everyday carry includes iPhone, Android phone, iPad and a MacBook Pro. Since my work and social life both depend on those devices, I pretty much live with them but I cannot stand the messy cables I have to carry with me as well. </p>

Before introducing this cable, I would like to first share with you TEGIC's slogan:  “No more Micro USB.” 
So I am sorry to inform you that this cable doesn't support Micro USB. Then here goes our story of Onix Cable. 
As new digital devices flood into the market at lightning speed, I have often found myself lost among all kinds of cables and chargers that match different devices. The chaos really bothers me. 
My everyday carry includes iPhone, Android phone, iPad and a MacBook Pro. Since my work and social life both depend on those devices, I pretty much live with them but I cannot stand the messy cables I have to carry with me as well. 
 A lot of people have tried to solve this problem. But as I have also discovered, frankly speaking, the solutions always bring in more issues and failed attempts to change my user habits.So I made the decision to figure out a solution that would not change any users habits for charging cables. That was the birth of ONIX CABLE, the all-in-one multifunction cord that is made to charge all your devices. NAMEI called it ONIX CABLE because, hmmm, my team didn't come up with a better name. Also, don’t we all think this cable looks a lot like the Onix from Pokémon? STRENGTHThis cable uses the most advanced connecting port, Type-C, for the fastest data transmission speed. In addition to the Type-C to Type-C function, we developed two separate connectors, one for USB-A and one for lightning, attached to each end of the cable. With a simple pull and plug, the head is switched and the connection is built within seconds. FOUR MODESOur design makes the ONIX Cable work in four different modes and is guaranteed to satisfy all your needs for device charging in daily life.ONIX’s Type-C to lightning function is the same as the most advanced Apple serial cable. It does not only support PD chargers, but also can connect to the latest MacBook and iPad for data transmission.ONIX’s USB to Type-C function also works as a popular way to charge Android phones for all the Android users.The USB to lightning function is mostly used by iPhone users and serves as the only way to connect an iPhone to most desktops.Finally, the Type C to Type C function represents the future trend of cables. The latest iPad and MacBook have already adopted this function into their charging cables.In addition to the digital devices listed above, ONIX cable is compatible with Switch and devices with the reverse-charging function.It is the one and only cable that supports four different charging modes that we hope you will fall in love with. COLORSThese are the two colors available at this moment.One is Nickel and the other is Gun color.About TEGICTEGIC is a tech venture founded in August 2018.

There’s no longer a need to buy screen protectors that only work with one product, and it’s so simple to apply, even a third grader could do it. *Do not allow third graders to apply solution. It is not recommended* With GlassX, all you need is the solution, a heating source, and a cloth to wipe. Each coating is a permanent coating that protects your iPhone and other devices from keys, drops, hammers and much more. We’re also including Spraygard which is an anti smudge and scratch solution that extends the protection even further while creating an ultra smooth smudge resistant surface.Our GlassX makes any device glass surface 10x more durable. Apply it on things like your Apple Watch, iPhone, Samsung device, watches, lenses and much more. You can order GlassX now and get FREE Shipping! GlassX will protect your device so well you’ll think that there was an actual 2nd glass on there. GlassX protects “invisibly” on a nano scale so you never have to worry again.CURRENT MARKET: What is GlassX?Not all glass are the same.  The glass on our devices all have imperfections that the naked eye could never see. These imperfections if zoomed in 1000x will show huge valleys and ridges that allow for sharp objects to latch onto.  Once these sharp objects latch onto these ridges, scratches appear and only get bigger over time.  We've developed a solution that will evenly bridge these gaps creating an ultra smooth surface.The main ingredient in our solution is SiO2, Silicon Dioxide.  What is Silicon Dioxide? Silicon dioxide is a chemical compound mostly obtained by mining and purification of quartz.  We've broken down the chemistry of SiO2 and formulated it into liquid glass.  Our liquid glass creates an ultra smooth surface that protects it from the everyday wear and tear of our lives. These are some of the awesome features of GlassX: 
Pioneered by California natives and engineered in the beautiful city of Commerce 
The coating is virtually invisible and does not apply any bulk
iPhone 8 and Samsung Galaxy S8, Note 8 ready!  GlassX will work on all future phones!
GlassX is a permanent liquid glass coating
9H Scratch Resistant
Spraygard - Allows for an ultra smooth smudge and scratch resistant finish after GlassX is applied (also included)
One GlassX vial can coat up to 3 devices
Never worry about bubbles or yellowing again.  The coating last the lifetime of your device.
 EFFECTS:GlassX Sharpie Test to show just how oil and water resistant the coating is.

GlassX on a half coated iPhone to show just how effective its scratch protection is.

 Our coating goes on 1000x thinner than a single strand of human hair!Watch as we let GlassX dry on a piece of glass. GlassX cured into glass. GlassX works on all types of glass surfaces!Phone/Tablet displays, Watch faces, glass optical lenses, Camera lenses, Digital Cameras, Touch screen devices and many other glass surfaces. Scratch Test ResultsThe results were obtained by a third party testing lab, TouchStone Testing Lab and our coating has been cleared for having a hardness score of 9H! We're extremely happy and proud about this and can't wait till everyone's devices are protected with GlassX.Protects against the everyday wear and tear such as keysWe've stress tested the coating with a box cutter!Falling screws were no problem for the invisible 9H coatingEven using the phone as a hammer was no issue for GlassX!How do I use it? 
Apply solution liberally onto your device’s screen (recommended 6 drops per phone display, 8 drops for tablets)
Wipe and work the solution into the screen
Let the solution air dry until haze appears
Apply heat from source like hair dryer at a safe distance for 2 minutes
Repeat steps for 4 more coatings, totaling 5 coatings per device for optimal results
Use 8-10 drops of Spraygard once GlassX coatings are completed to give an ultra smooth smudge resistant surface
 Where we're atWe’ve been engineering tirelessly for years trying to perfect the GlassX solution. We’ve finally come to the finish line and are now able to provide protection to all types of devices. What you see in this campaign is not wizardry or fake, this stuff actually works! With your support, we will be able to bring GlassX to the world, a solution that is engineered for elegance, and effectiveness. Your contribution will help fund: 
Procurement of solution materials
Production of larger quantities 
Further research
And bringing the protection of GlassX to life for everyone utilize 
Our goalOur scientists and engineers are ready to take the next steps and move into mass production. We’ve done the research, spent countless hours testing in our labs, and now have the solution to your protection needs. We’re ready to go, and excited to show the world what GlassX can do. We’ve also sourced our package manufacturers who will aid our California office in putting the orders together and to ship out. With many other industry leading vendors we’ve calculated the initial shipping dates. All we need now is your support. We plan to ship out orders of our first major production in August 2017 so you can run full steam into holiday season protected..Why we need your help Mass manufacturing a product like GlassX is no easy feat. We’ve become experts in doing that but need your financial support. The funds raised will allow us to put that directly towards covering upfront manufacturing costs. We need your help and we can’t do it without you. We know this is going to be big! So let’s take this first step together. Our TimelineOur campaign on Kickstarter has already completed so we are giving the Indiegogo community a chance to preorder GlassX at a huge discount!  GlassX is already in production thanks to the backers at Kickstarter so your pledge will be rewarded shortly after the campaign ends!Be part of the global effort to protect our devices. Special Thanks THANK YOU! A shout out to everyone who has supported and made GlassX what it is today! ©GlassX 2018, All rights reserved.

<p><b>WHAT IS
FIXICO?</b></p>
<p>Fixico™ is like
having a mini IT guy in your computer that works 24/7, never eats, never
sleeps, and is always making sure that your computers are running smoothly,
efficiently and safely - without bothering you.</p>
<p>The first thing
you need to understand about Fixico is that it is not just another proggy but an entire platform. Fixico
manages maintenance activities for you  –
meaning, if we take antivirus as an example, it schedules scans and
removes threats automatically, without needing any guidance from the end-user
(AKA you :)) . But the antivirus is just one small part of Fixico – we also do
operating system and common program updates, (including JAVA, Adobe, iTunes, Skype and more), defrag your drive as needed, clean registry and junk files as needed
and much more (with more still coming in the near future, because as we said, we are a platform
and a very dynamically developing and flexible one at that). In short - Fixico is an all-in-one automatic
maintenance solution, it makes sure your computer runs smoothly and safely at
all times, without bothering you.</p>
<p><b>WHO IS IT FOR?</b></p>
<p>Actually - anyone
with a desktop or laptop computer. Fixico streamlines maintenance activities so
that you can enjoy your computer without needing to invest time doing boring
maintenance stuff. </p>
<p><i><b>Families</b> <b>(kids) </b></i>- Tired of
being their own private IT people? Want to rest assured that they are safe online? Dad
or Mom can be the admin and manage all of the computers in their family from
one easy-to-use web interface. To keep your children safe Fixico makes sure all
security patches are done to keep cyber-criminals from exploiting security holes
found in unpatched programs, and that the antivirus is running correctly and
updated. In addition, Fixico offers 
content filtering options, beginning from non-secure sites and hardcore
adult content, but also covering non-family-friendly sites and popular social
networks.</p>

the online game is rising rapidly. Fixico allows them to use their computers
worry-free, does maintenance for them in the background, and keeps them safe
from external threats by applying security patches, blocking malicious sites
and scanning for viruses, while keeping their computers in top shape by running
defrag, cleaning registry &amp; junk files and more.</p>

<p><b>TECHNICAL
INFORMATION</b></p>
<p><u>Downloaded
Agent</u></p>
<p>The Fixico agent
is a small program taking no more than 10MB of your computer’s RAM and 2% of
its CPU. It is installed on every computer (or endpoint), communicating back
with the Fixico Cloud Server Farm. The Agent is responsible to gather relevant
information from the PC hardware and Operating System and perform necessary
adjustments. The Fixico Agent uses a secure connection with the Fixico Server
Farm, and can work even with very slow internet connections. The Fixico Agent
monitors the endpoint computer even when the computer itself is not connected to
the Internet and can take proactive actions while the endpoint computer is
disconnected.</p>
<p><u>Fixico Cloud
Server Farm</u></p>
<p></p>
<p>Fixico’s servers
receive information from Agents on a regular basis. Based on this information,
Fixico will decide which OS patches, application updates or system
configurations are to be applied to every endpoint computer the Agent is
communicating from. Fixico servers regularly receive lists of the most current
patches and updates from IBM’s servers, managed by IBM’s IT professionals. These
professionals also check and mark all of the vendor patches in order to make
sure they are safe to apply. This greatly reduces the possibility that an
applied patch will cause issues to the endpoint computer. Fixico analyzes
current endpoint computer data, taking proactive steps in order to improve
performance and efficiency of the computer. When there is need for manual
action (like replacing a faulty hardware component), Fixico communicates this
to the endpoint user. Quite often, Fixico will even predict hardware component
failure, alerting the endpoint user before losing sensitive data. Fixico will
also advise you how to spend your money best in order to speed up your computer
– on RAM, SSD Disk, Processor and more.</p>

you need to understand about Fixico is that it is not just another proggy but an entire platform. Fixico
manages maintenance activities for you  –
meaning, if we take antivirus as an example, it schedules scans and
removes threats automatically, without needing any guidance from the end-user
(AKA you :)) . But the antivirus is just one small part of Fixico – we also do
operating system and common program updates, (including JAVA, Adobe, iTunes, Skype and more), defrag your drive as needed, clean registry and junk files as needed
and much more (with more still coming in the near future, because as we said, we are a platform
and a very dynamically developing and flexible one at that). In short - Fixico is an all-in-one automatic
maintenance solution, it makes sure your computer runs smoothly and safely at
all times, without bothering you.
WHO IS IT FOR?
Actually - anyone
with a desktop or laptop computer. Fixico streamlines maintenance activities so
that you can enjoy your computer without needing to invest time doing boring
maintenance stuff. 
Families (kids) - Tired of
being their own private IT people? Want to rest assured that they are safe online? Dad
or Mom can be the admin and manage all of the computers in their family from
one easy-to-use web interface. To keep your children safe Fixico makes sure all
security patches are done to keep cyber-criminals from exploiting security holes
found in unpatched programs, and that the antivirus is running correctly and
updated. In addition, Fixico offers 
content filtering options, beginning from non-secure sites and hardcore
adult content, but also covering non-family-friendly sites and popular social
networks.



Seniors - Seniors participation in
the online game is rising rapidly. Fixico allows them to use their computers
worry-free, does maintenance for them in the background, and keeps them safe
from external threats by applying security patches, blocking malicious sites
and scanning for viruses, while keeping their computers in top shape by running
defrag, cleaning registry & junk files and more.



Small
businesses -
Small businesses that cannot afford a resident IT person or an outsourced IT
service, can find it all in a solution that is perfect for managing and keeping in shape employee computers without any
technical knowledge. For SMBs Fixico also includes Data protection options - i.e. restricting external drives.

take a lot of system resources - works in the background without interrupting
users even while it scans.
• 
Automatic updates & security patches - Antivirus alone is
not enough.  Fixico uses IBM patch management technology to keep
computers updated with the latest security patches to prevent cyber-criminals
from exploiting security holes to infect your system. Fixico also run
functionality updates for OS & common programs automatically to keep them
running smoothly. Patches are tested before they are deployed to prevent faulty
patches from being applied (see Microsoft's debacle with the Blue Screen of
Death Patch, for example - this patch wasn't applied at Fixico subscribers' machines.

TECHNICAL
INFORMATION
Downloaded
Agent
The Fixico agent
is a small program taking no more than 10MB of your computer’s RAM and 2% of
its CPU. It is installed on every computer (or endpoint), communicating back
with the Fixico Cloud Server Farm. The Agent is responsible to gather relevant
information from the PC hardware and Operating System and perform necessary
adjustments. The Fixico Agent uses a secure connection with the Fixico Server
Farm, and can work even with very slow internet connections. The Fixico Agent
monitors the endpoint computer even when the computer itself is not connected to
the Internet and can take proactive actions while the endpoint computer is
disconnected.
Fixico Cloud
Server Farm

Fixico’s servers
receive information from Agents on a regular basis. Based on this information,
Fixico will decide which OS patches, application updates or system
configurations are to be applied to every endpoint computer the Agent is
communicating from. Fixico servers regularly receive lists of the most current
patches and updates from IBM’s servers, managed by IBM’s IT professionals. These
professionals also check and mark all of the vendor patches in order to make
sure they are safe to apply. This greatly reduces the possibility that an
applied patch will cause issues to the endpoint computer. Fixico analyzes
current endpoint computer data, taking proactive steps in order to improve
performance and efficiency of the computer. When there is need for manual
action (like replacing a faulty hardware component), Fixico communicates this
to the endpoint user. Quite often, Fixico will even predict hardware component
failure, alerting the endpoint user before losing sensitive data. Fixico will
also advise you how to spend your money best in order to speed up your computer
– on RAM, SSD Disk, Processor and more.",5.0,1,"1 Campaign

Though it is legal to carry defense sprays in all 50 States, there are a number of cities and states with specific regulations pertaining to the purchase, possession and use of aerosol defense sprays—it is your responsibility to check with your local police department. If you are unsure of the restriction in your area, check with your local law enforcement for specific laws regarding the possession and use of defense spray products. We CANNOT ship the Defender product to New York, Massachusetts, Internationally, or by Air. Improper use of the Defender could result in criminal action. If you use the Defender in an improper manner, you could be sued or in some states fined and/or imprisoned. The Defender product will contain pepper spray and cannot be carried on a commercial airline where it is accessible - this is a federal crime with a $25,000 fine. Keep the Defender product out of reach of children for their protection. Applicable laws and specific regulations pertaining to the purchase, possession and use of aerosol defense sprays may change prior to time of shipment of the Defender product. If it is illegal to deliver the Defender product to your shipping address at time of shipment, then we will return your contribution and not deliver the Defender product to you.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3><b>FAQ</b></h3><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: When will The Defender be available for FOREVER FUNDING CONTRIBUTORS?</b></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </b>Supporting our campaign on Indiegogo will allow us to finalize manufacturing and product development.  When we launched our campaign, December was our targeted delivery date.  For FOREVER FUNDING CONTRIBUTORS, we will be announcing a delivery schedule in December.  If we have revisions to the product based on feedback, there may be shipping delays.  If that occurs, we will communicate with our contributors first to let you know of any delays. </p><p> </p><p><b>Q: What versions of iOS and Android will be compatible?</b></p><p><b><b>A:</b> </b>The Defender uses Bluetooth to connect to your smart phone.

Though it is legal to carry defense sprays in all 50 States, there are a number of cities and states with specific regulations pertaining to the purchase, possession and use of aerosol defense sprays—it is your responsibility to check with your local police department. If you are unsure of the restriction in your area, check with your local law enforcement for specific laws regarding the possession and use of defense spray products. We CANNOT ship the Defender product to New York, Massachusetts, Internationally, or by Air. Improper use of the Defender could result in criminal action. If you use the Defender in an improper manner, you could be sued or in some states fined and/or imprisoned. The Defender product will contain pepper spray and cannot be carried on a commercial airline where it is accessible - this is a federal crime with a $25,000 fine. Keep the Defender product out of reach of children for their protection. Applicable laws and specific regulations pertaining to the purchase, possession and use of aerosol defense sprays may change prior to time of shipment of the Defender product. If it is illegal to deliver the Defender product to your shipping address at time of shipment, then we will return your contribution and not deliver the Defender product to you.    FAQ        Q: When will The Defender be available for FOREVER FUNDING CONTRIBUTORS?    A: Supporting our campaign on Indiegogo will allow us to finalize manufacturing and product development.  When we launched our campaign, December was our targeted delivery date.  For FOREVER FUNDING CONTRIBUTORS, we will be announcing a delivery schedule in December.  If we have revisions to the product based on feedback, there may be shipping delays.  If that occurs, we will communicate with our contributors first to let you know of any delays.  Q: What versions of iOS and Android will be compatible?A: The Defender uses Bluetooth to connect to your smart phone. For iOS, we support iPhone 4 and later with iOS6 and later.  For Android, we support  Android 4.3 or later.  We are also interested in extending The Defender to other smart phone platforms in the near future.  Email lisa@getthedefender.com to tell us what device you want to use with The Defender.       Q: I see a lot of apps available that offer help in distress situations. How does The Defender compare to these apps/services?    A: The apps available for distress situations are primarily passive alarms with one or two features. In fact, you might just describe the apps as I am waiting for someone to help me. Our product empowers the user by providing them a vast array of options that they can select to help themselves. There is HUGE difference between an app that provides a monitoring service, and actually responding. The Defender provides you with both prevention and assistance by combining:*A digital camera to capture the photo of an assailant*Bluetooth connection to transmit the photo and alert signal*An audible siren and speaker that announces to the assailant that their photo and GPS coordinates have been sent to the authorities*An oscillating flash to attract attention*The highest concentration of pepper spray available to law-enforcement*A smart phone app which transmits all of this information to our monitoring team who communicate directly with all 911 centers in North America*Notifications are sent via text and e-mail to a preset contact list, identifying the nature of the alert triggered      Q: When Does Someone Need The Defender?    A: Because you do not know when your safety will be threated or a medical situation will occur, you will always want to have The Defender with you. Some users may have serious medical conditions including:*Epilepsy or other conditions which cause seizures*Heart conditions*Diabetes*Breathing difficulties which make talking near impossible*Severe diabetes*Blood pressure issues or prone to faintingOther situations where a safety alert is critical:*Animal attack*Auto accident or some other issue where the user needs medical assistance*Attacked when working out in a park or on a secluded trail*Alone at night on a college campus*In unfamiliar or unsafe areas*When the last employee leaves a business at night      Q: How does The Defender work once an alert has been triggered?    A: The Defender provides both a text and an email, which indicates the nature of your medical alert. Medical alerts are sent to your specified contact list, and to The Defender’s Security Service. Once first responders receive this alert, your location and a picture of you is in-hand.Your personal description of specific medical issue(s) will be sent via texts or emails. You will have the ability to describe the kind of help you may need, providing first responders with potentially life saving information! Details may also include, but are not limited to, your doctor’s personal contact information and your insurance policy details.      Q: Is Defender appropriate for a college campus?    A: YES! Let’s be clear, criminals want anonymity and quiet to perpetrate their crimes and victimize someone. They do not want to encounter someone equipped with The Defender. You will have the power to capture their photo for identification, disrupt their advances with pepper spray, attract attention with an oscillating flash and loud alarm, bringing maximum attention to the attempted crime. The Defender’s 24/7 Monitoring Service will forward the photo with your GPS location, and personalized info to law enforcement or medical authorities.You want to help yourself and those you care about in every way possible to prevent being victimized. With The Defender on your team, you will have that power!      Q: Can I use The Defender if I do NOT have a smartphone?    A: Sorry, no. You must have the app to effectively use our product and connect to the Defender’s 24/7 Monitoring Service.     Q: Will Defender work if my smartphone does not have reception?    A: Your smartphone must have a WiFi or Cellular signal to allow for our product to fully perform. The Defender service requires a data connection to communicate with our 24/7 Monitoring service and your contacts.Please be sure to properly maintain and charge your smartphone.     Q: How will I know if The Defender is connected?    A: The Defender’s compact speaker announces that when the device is connected and alerts you when the device is disconnected.      Q: I am currently using a Medical Alert Product (PERS), how does the The Defender compare?    A: The Defender gives you EVERYWHERE SECURITY with assistance for both medical alerts as well as safety situations where law enforcement is needed. The Defender is a real value. The Defender and our 24/7 monitoring service will be half the price of most Medical Alert / PERS products, with the hardware being provided at no cost with a two year subscription.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

can instantly view the real time data of your car.  Autobot will sync the data to your phone via
Bluetooth, record it, and save the data to cloud storage.  It will also function as a well-trusted
“black box” for your car.</p>
<p>The Autobot project was initiated in 2013, and is being developed in
Beijing, China.  Our team is comprised of
industrial designers, automotive engineers, as well as experienced iOS and
Android software developers.  We have
tested multiple existing OBD products and found them to be lacking in several
functions including mobile connectivity. 
Therefore, Autobot was designed to facilitate the synchronization of a
user’s mobile device and their automobile.   </p><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px; font-weight: normal;"">Here are our team members:</span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/514139/files/20140416210705-image_1397635975.185954.jpg?1397707625"" src="""" style=""width: 98.02105263157895px; height: 97px;""/>  <b>Edwin How</b>, CEO, Chief iOS and Android Programmer </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/514141/files/20140416210838-image_1397635751.765778.jpg?1397707718"" src="""" style=""width: 99px; height: 99px;""/>  <b>Liang Cai</b>, Chief Designer </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/514142/files/20140416210938-image_1397635733.989649.jpg?1397707778"" src="""" style=""width: 99px; height: 99px;""/>  <b>Fendi Cheng</b>, Chief Operation </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/514143/files/20140416211108-image_1397635761.496733.jpg?1397707868"" src="""" style=""width: 101px; height: 101px;""/> <b>Ou Chao</b>, Chief Server Programmer </p><p></p><p></p><p>

</p><p>We found that OBD was not a suitable solution for the average
consumer.  Not everyone knows how to use
it.  There should be an easy way to
connect your car with your mobile device. 
So now, we introduce Autobot.  It
is a good choice for any automobile, and is not just for technical auto fans,
but for the everyday driver as well. 
Both OBD ports and cigarette lighters are compatible with Autobot.  Autobot can display all of your car’s data on
your mobile device, as well as accurately track your car via GPS.  </p>
<p>We have worked on Autobot’s hardware manufacturing and application
development for one year.  It should be
completed and released to the public in the middle of July 2014 as
scheduled.  So we have come to Indiegogo
to introduce Autobot to potential customers and get your support.  We believe that Autobot will change the way
that you use your car, and bring you a completely new driving experience.  Thank you.</p>

What are the primary functions of
AutoBot?</b><br/></p>
<p>Your AutoBot is able to collect detailed
driving data through your vehicle's OBD-II port.  It keeps constant track of your fuel
consumption and driving habits to let you know how much you've spent in fuel
per drive, and suggest ways to change your driving habits in order to improve
gas mileage.  The AutoBot is able to
watch over your vehicle's major systems and inform you in case of malfunctions.  Using low-power Bluetooth 4.0, the AutoBot
syncs vehicle data with your iPhone or Android handset and present all your
vehicle's info in our beautifully designed AutoBot App.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the AutoBot can record your
vehicle's travel route, including stoppage time, location, speed and
acceleration data to form a personalized history of your trip.  By combining the geo-tag and time stamp on
your photos, AutoBot can create beautifully detailed trip memories that you can
play back and share with friends and families.</p>
<p>We have been able to improve signal processing
and reduce interference through advanced materials and design.  As a result, the AutoBot is able to maintain
the consistent GPS signal reception throughout your travel.</p>
<p><b>2. Does it support OBD-II interface module?</b></p>
<p>We've received lots of questions regarding
AutoBot and OBD-II.  We have decided to
combine the questions and answer them in this section.</p>
<p>OBD-II, short for On-board diagnostics,
refers to the vehicle's self-diagnostic and reporting capability.  It can provide a range of information from
fuel consumption, water temperature, engine speed, to a series of diagnostic
trouble codes.  OBD-II is equipped on
vehicles manufactured since 2007.</p>
<p>In short, the AutoBot fully supports OBD-II
interface module.  However, AutoBot isn't
limited to only newer vehicles.  For
those without OBD-II interface module, the AutoBot will use its internal GPS,
gyroscope and processing unit to calculate your driving habit and fuel
consumption.  For those with OBD-II, it
will read the fuel consumption, water temperature, engine speed and other
vehicle data through the interface.</p>
<p>The AutoBot comes with two connectors.  If your vehicle is 2007 or newer and supports
OBD-II, then you can connect the AutoBot to said interface.  If your vehicle does not support OBD-II, you can
still obtain basic driving data by connecting the AutoBot to your vehicle's
12-V receptacle (commonly known as the cigarette lighter)</p>
<p><b>3. Questions related to power connector</b></p>
<p><b>3.1 Why don't you just make AutoBot connect
directly to the cigarette lighter or OBD-II interface plug?  Wouldn't that avoid having to wire the
AutoBot to the vehicle's power source separately?</b></p>
<p>We have considered doing so.  However, the location and placement of the
12-V receptacle and the OBD-II interface plug varies between manufacturers and
vehicle models.  This uncertainty means
on some applications the GPS signal reception may be weakened.  In order to ensure the best user experience
and stability in signal reception, we have designed the AutoBot to perform at
its best located on the center console. 
The carefully crafted unit will complement all types of vehicle cabins
beautifully.  The AutoBot is able to
achieve its look and function by using both an internal battery and dedicated
power wiring.</p>
<p><b>3.2 Why did you choose to use both a
battery and power wire?</b></p>
<p>The AutoBot is equipped with an internal
battery to ensure that you can still sync its data via Bluetooth within 1-2
hours after you've turned your vehicle off.</p>
<p>We have decided not to use a larger battery
in place of the power wire, once again to ensure we have a consistent, complete
and accurate record of the driving history. 
If we use only the battery to power the AutoBot, our users will run the
risk of losing the precious data when the battery runs out.</p>
<p>We also feel that in order for the AutoBot
to truly make a difference in our daily driving habits and keep track of
vehicle functionalities, using it must be intuitive.  If we have to constantly remember to recharge
the unit on a regular basis, chances are the data collected won't be complete,
and we would have to deal with the eventual degradation of battery
capacity.  If we are able to power the
unit constantly, whether it's through the 12-V receptacle or the OBD-II
connector, then we can guarantee that as long as the vehicle is travelling, the
data will be recorded.</p>
<p><b>4. How do you transfer data from the
AutoBot, and will it affect my handset battery?</b></p>
<p>The AutoBot is equipped with internal
memory that can store 60 days worth of vehicle and driving data.  Syncing is as simple as turning on your
handset's Bluetooth and has the AutoBot app running.  Once paired, the syncing is automatic.  The AutoBot uses its own internal GPS
hardware, and will not engage your handset's GPS chipset, so it will not
adversely affect your handset battery life.</p>
<p><b>5. Can you incorporate dash-cam into
AutoBot?</b></p>
<p>We have received numerous emails requesting
that we combine dash-cam functions into AutoBot.  At this early stage, we have decided to focus
our limited resource on the core functionality. 
We will take a look at incorporating dash-cam into AutoBot once we are
satisfied with its core performance.</p>
<p><b>6. Can AutoBot support multiple vehicles?</b></p>
<p>Yes it can. 
AutoBot syncs with your handset, and once it is synchronized, your data
will be stored in the cloud.  You can
create different accounts to keep track of different vehicle data.</p>
<p><b>7. How is AutoBot different from other
OBD-II productions on the market?</b></p>
<p>Currently, most OBD-II products capture GPS
data through the handset's GPS chipset, so the bulk of the processing is done
by your handset.  This means your phone
has to be connected to a power source constantly and the recording app has to
be turned on at all times.  As a result,
the users tend to stop using such product after forgetting to turn it on a
couple of times.  </p>
<p>Our goal is to give you the most simple way
of capturing your travel log, complete with driving history, habits, and
vehicle diagnostic information, therefore we chose to combine all the data
collection and processing into the AutoBot unit itself, so you won't have to
think about turning anything else on apart from your ignition, and the AutoBot
will collect, process and store automatically. 
All your data is just sync away.</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________</p><p></p><h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3><p><br/></p><h3></h3><p>

 to make PiPiano a reality! Thank you to all our contributors, and 
anyone who shared or helped PiPiano! Please continue to support and 
share PiPiano! If you have any stretch goal ideas, let me know!</b></p><p></p><h1>Story</h1><p></p><p>At just 14 years old, Zach is a Raspberry Pi prodigy and regular attendee at Cambridge Raspberry Jams where he demonstrates his Pi robotics projects.</p><p>He wanted to create a Piano with his Raspberry Pi, but adding switches to a real piano would be a wiring nightmare, and involve taking the piano apart and doing unspeakable things to it. The solution? Create a simple, piano-style add-on for the Raspberry Pi which includes buttons in a piano octave formation, and a piezo transducer for sound output.</p><p>After trying it on a breadboard, and being swamped with bundles of spaghetti wiring, he opted to lay out the idea on a PCB. Doing so is an effort in itself, however, so he chose to make it as flexible and expandable as possible.</p><b></b><p></p><h1>What is it?</h1><p></p><p>The PiPiano uses an i2c I/O expander to connect the buttons, eliminating the need for 13 GPIO pins and leaving nearly all of them free for other projects. Also, with only 13 of the 16 expander pins used, adding 3 LEDs was a no-brainer; these are great for keeping time while playing.</p><p>The result? A Pi add-on board which includes 13 buttons, great for either music or controlling projects, and 3 LEDs, handy for keeping time or notifications.</p><p>The board uses the well known and well supported MCP23017 IO expander chip which has become a mainstay with Raspberry Pi projects. It’s easy to talk to, and uses only i2c on address 0x20, leaving all of the GPIO pins, except for the one used by the piezo, accessible via an optional stacking header.</p><p><b>That’s 17 IO components, and only 3 pins used!</b></p><b></b><p></p><h1>What can you do with it?</h1><p></p><p>PiPiano is a great little classroom board, with the potential to teach soldering skills and allow the exploration of music and sound generation. The readily available code shows how PWM frequency corresponds to a musical note.</p><p>When it’s not a Piano, it’s a handy controller with an ample supply of buttons which could be used in an automation project, a D.I.Y. Turtle, shortcut buttons to run scripts on your Pi, or anything else you can imagine.</p><p>Because it uses only a few GPIO pins and a common, well documented i2c IO expander, it can be easily combined with a number of other Pi peripherals. You can use it as part of a more complex setup or, if you’re determined, even as input for an Arduino-based project.</p><p></p><h1>Why Indiegogo?</h1><p></p><p>Zach may be only 14, but he’s well connected with the Pi community and has received good feedback and a green light for making PiPiano a reality. What he doesn’t have, however, is money to invest and fund the production of PCBs. This is where you come in- through Indiegogo you’ll provide the support needed to get PiPiano off the ground. Without that support, it simply can’t happen!</p><p></p><h1>What do you get?</h1><p></p><p>Due to its 26pin header ( Model B, Model A ) the PiPiano is compatible with all Raspberry Pi models including Model A, Model B (all revisions) and the new Model B+. It comes as either a kit, or ready soldered. PiPiano includes:</p><ol>

In less than a week, we have all the money
 to make PiPiano a reality! Thank you to all our contributors, and 
anyone who shared or helped PiPiano! Please continue to support and 
share PiPiano! If you have any stretch goal ideas, let me know!StoryAt just 14 years old, Zach is a Raspberry Pi prodigy and regular attendee at Cambridge Raspberry Jams where he demonstrates his Pi robotics projects.He wanted to create a Piano with his Raspberry Pi, but adding switches to a real piano would be a wiring nightmare, and involve taking the piano apart and doing unspeakable things to it. The solution? Create a simple, piano-style add-on for the Raspberry Pi which includes buttons in a piano octave formation, and a piezo transducer for sound output.After trying it on a breadboard, and being swamped with bundles of spaghetti wiring, he opted to lay out the idea on a PCB. Doing so is an effort in itself, however, so he chose to make it as flexible and expandable as possible.What is it?The PiPiano uses an i2c I/O expander to connect the buttons, eliminating the need for 13 GPIO pins and leaving nearly all of them free for other projects. Also, with only 13 of the 16 expander pins used, adding 3 LEDs was a no-brainer; these are great for keeping time while playing.The result? A Pi add-on board which includes 13 buttons, great for either music or controlling projects, and 3 LEDs, handy for keeping time or notifications.The board uses the well known and well supported MCP23017 IO expander chip which has become a mainstay with Raspberry Pi projects. It’s easy to talk to, and uses only i2c on address 0x20, leaving all of the GPIO pins, except for the one used by the piezo, accessible via an optional stacking header.That’s 17 IO components, and only 3 pins used!What can you do with it?PiPiano is a great little classroom board, with the potential to teach soldering skills and allow the exploration of music and sound generation. The readily available code shows how PWM frequency corresponds to a musical note.When it’s not a Piano, it’s a handy controller with an ample supply of buttons which could be used in an automation project, a D.I.Y. Turtle, shortcut buttons to run scripts on your Pi, or anything else you can imagine.Because it uses only a few GPIO pins and a common, well documented i2c IO expander, it can be easily combined with a number of other Pi peripherals. You can use it as part of a more complex setup or, if you’re determined, even as input for an Arduino-based project.Why Indiegogo?Zach may be only 14, but he’s well connected with the Pi community and has received good feedback and a green light for making PiPiano a reality. What he doesn’t have, however, is money to invest and fund the production of PCBs. This is where you come in- through Indiegogo you’ll provide the support needed to get PiPiano off the ground. Without that support, it simply can’t happen!What do you get?Due to its 26pin header ( Model B, Model A ) the PiPiano is compatible with all Raspberry Pi models including Model A, Model B (all revisions) and the new Model B+. It comes as either a kit, or ready soldered. PiPiano includes:
PiPiano PCB
13 tactile switches
Red LED
Yellow LED
Green LED
Piezo Transducer
MCP23017
Resistors
Capacitor
26-pin header ( optional stackable upgrade )
PiPiano comes either soldered, as a kit, and with either a standard header or a stacking header. UK delivery is included, or you can have your PiPiano delivered internationally for a small extra sum.Tier  | Standard Header  | Stacking Header   | Soldered   | UnsolderedA                       X                                    -                              -                      XB                       X                                    -                             X                      -C                      -                                     X                             -                      XDocumentation & ExamplesSee the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ZacharyIgielman/PiPianoHere you can find a comprehensive set of documentation including detailed assembly instructions, and tutorials for using PiPiano plus a ready-to-play Python example, with a complete equivalent written in C. There’s also a Sonic Pi integration, which generates a file you can load up and play in Sonic Pi.The tutorials cover each aspect of PiPiano in both Python, using Adafruit_I2C and RPi.GPIO, and C, using WiringPi. We hope they serve as a gentle introduction to lights, buttons and buzzers in C.When complete we hope the documentation will include guides for:
Assembling and soldering the board, with a basic intro to soldering
Sounding the buzzer at different pitches using Python/C on the Pi
Reading the buttons from the MCP23017 i2c IO expander.
Driving the LEDs from the MCP23017 i2c IO expander
Making a simple, one-octave piano with LED metronome
Using Python, you can hook PiPiano up to a variety of applications- we’ve managed to get it working with PureData and even Sunvox, making the tiny little keyboard into a powerful polyphonic software synthesizer or a souped-up stylophone.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Our phone is DIY repairable, meaning you can fix some of the components yourself or you can take advantage of our 4-year premium care warranty plan and we'll do it for you! Most smartphones use tons of glue, we don't. We use screws and replaceable components making it easy to do it yourself with the provided instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Eco-friendly composition</strong></p>
<p>The packaging is made with recycled paper and printed using soy ink.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>50% reduced packaging</strong></p>
<p>Teracube 2e's packaging is also 50% smaller than typical smartphone packaging. We did this by eliminating redundant accessories - the charger, cable, and earphones which most users already have. The smaller packaging will also reduce carbon emissions from shipping.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>USB-C compatible</strong></p>
<p>Teracube 2e can only charge with USB-A (regular USB socket) to USB-C chargers/cables and can not charge using USB-C PD chargers.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The team bringing you Teracube has many combined years experience launching consumer electronics and software. To minimize delays, a great deal of the work has already been done before launching on Kickstarter. We have been developing and testing the prototypes for the past 6 months. We have a set of proven partners in both software and hardware engineering for building the phone itself, as well as fulfillment companies for shipping. Last but not least, a contract has been signed with our manufacturing partner which allows us to start production as soon as the campaign completes. There are always certain risks that can arise at any moment during a project like this. That being said, we’re confident in our ability to deliver, and have taken all the necessary measures. The project timeline includes buffers to accommodate parts or manufacturing delays. If anything comes up along the way, you’ll be the first to know. </p>

Hey Backers - we're back with our next phone after successfully delivering our first product - Teracube One. Teracube 2e has a replaceable battery, is DIY repairable, made from recycled material, and comes with a sturdy biodegradable case.
We are also excited to announce that we are expanding Teracube 2e's 4-year premium care warranty to the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, and Poland in addition to the US and Canada.
 


 




Yes, we’ve brought back the replaceable battery. Tired of losing battery performance over the year? It’s one of the main reasons people throw away their old phone. Whenever your battery starts losing performance, just pop the back and replace it. Yes, we’ve got backup batteries for you, too. It is 4000mAh capacity and can last up to 2 days on a single charge.
 
 


Our phone is DIY repairable, meaning you can fix some of the components yourself or you can take advantage of our 4-year premium care warranty plan and we'll do it for you! Most smartphones use tons of glue, we don't. We use screws and replaceable components making it easy to do it yourself with the provided instructions.
 

 
 


 

Eco-friendly composition
The packaging is made with recycled paper and printed using soy ink.
 
50% reduced packaging
Teracube 2e's packaging is also 50% smaller than typical smartphone packaging. We did this by eliminating redundant accessories - the charger, cable, and earphones which most users already have. The smaller packaging will also reduce carbon emissions from shipping.
 
USB-C compatible
Teracube 2e can only charge with USB-A (regular USB socket) to USB-C chargers/cables and can not charge using USB-C PD chargers.

We're in production and right on schedule! (October 25th)









Risks & Challenges
The team bringing you Teracube has many combined years experience launching consumer electronics and software. To minimize delays, a great deal of the work has already been done before launching on Kickstarter. We have been developing and testing the prototypes for the past 6 months. We have a set of proven partners in both software and hardware engineering for building the phone itself, as well as fulfillment companies for shipping. Last but not least, a contract has been signed with our manufacturing partner which allows us to start production as soon as the campaign completes. There are always certain risks that can arise at any moment during a project like this. That being said, we’re confident in our ability to deliver, and have taken all the necessary measures. The project timeline includes buffers to accommodate parts or manufacturing delays. If anything comes up along the way, you’ll be the first to know. 

 


We can’t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make Teracube 2e a reality.
We know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can’t give a dollar or purchase a Teracube 2e, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!",72.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<br/><p><b>What if you could interact with any smart device using your personal style of interaction?</b> What if this was easy to learn, gives you exact control and unlimited possibilities? This is the vision of the Erghis Sphere, a complete re-imagining of touch-free interfaces. As simple as holding a sphere. 
</p>
<p>
ErghisTech is a Swedish startup working on creating a software program that leverages third-party motion sensor data output to simulate an invisible sphere that follows your hands. By using a virtual object instead of discrete gestures it allows you to achieve advanced touchless interaction without a large learning curve. We imagine a future where motion sensors are built into ever smaller computers and you use the Erghis Sphere to control them. 
</p>
<blockquote style=""margin-top: 20px;""><i><b>""For the computer this is a set of gestures, for you it is a magical object that gives you unique personalised control.""</b></i></blockquote>
</div>
<br/><br/><h1 style=""color: #1E9E1E; font-size: 22pt; line-height: 25pt;"">The Magic of Touch-Free is Here to Stay</h1>
<p>An incredible amount of innovation has taken place the last couple of years. Devices that allow your computer to sense and interpret your movements are now a reality. First came the Kinect that enabled you to play games using your body as a controller. Then came the Leap Motion that gives you precision interaction necessary to perform more delicate functions.</p>
<p>The coming years several other technologies are to be released that in different ways provide your computer with eyes and ears. From now on, computers will be able to sense you and your motions. But what will this mean for the way you interact with your devices?</p>
<br/><blockquote style=""margin-top: 20px;""><i><b>""What if you could use whichever sensor hardware you want and still never need to learn a new style of interaction?""</b></i></blockquote>
<br/><p>


Currently, each touch-free application uses its own set of gestures, and quite often, different apps use the same gesture to mean different things. To use touchless technologies you'll have to learn each app's particular set of gestures, and the more complicated the interaction, the more gestures you'll have to learn. </p>
<p>This will only get worse as more apps and sensors become available. What if instead you could use whichever sensor hardware you want and still never need to learn a new style of interaction?</p>
<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://erghis.com/img/580x380simplesphere.png"" src="""" style=""""/><p style=""color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%; margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 0px;"">""As simple as holding a Sphere"":  Using third-party sensors, the Erghis Software simulates a Sphere that you can  use to control your computer.  Many companies are working on touch-free. See a list <a href=""http://erghis.com/touch-free/list-of-sensor-makers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<br/><p>We at ErghisTech really see the potential in touch-free interaction, and we want to make it as useful as possible. By focussing on developing an easy-to-learn, easy-to-use interface and leaving the sensing hardware to others, we have produced a concept that allows powerful interaction, without making it hard to learn.</p>
<p>How? It’s simple, really. Instead of trying to remember loads of different gestures, just imagine that you’re holding a sphere in your hands. Now gestures like twisting, pulling or tapping the sphere will come naturally. Each of these can then be mapped to a character or command. A visualization of the sphere on your computer display (or through your smart glasses) will show you how it reacts to you. Interacting with your smart devices will no longer feel like it’s being done through a series of gestures, but by manipulating an object in your hands, as if it were actually there.</p>
<p>Use a third-party sensor to detect your hands and the Erghis software to interpret your gestures, and the virtual sphere becomes a powerful yet easy-to-use touch-free interface between you and your smart devices. </p>

What if they supported the Sphere? Take a look at some smart glasses <a href=""http://erghis.com/touch-free/smart-glass-solutions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<br/><p>The world is at a crossroads. The technology that gives your computer eyes is still too young for big corporations to invest in full interaction systems. There is a historical opportunity to create an interface that is independent democratic and based in people. Help us help you avoid standardized difficult to use and learn gesture systems. Help us to quite literally put touch-free interaction into your hands.</p>
<hr style=""margin-top: 20px;""/><br/><h1 style=""color: #1E9E1E; font-size: 22pt; line-height: 25pt;"">Our Prototype</h1>
<p>
<b>We wanted to see how people would react to using an imaginary sphere for their computer interaction, so we developed a prototype for Windows: <a href=""https://airspace.leapmotion.com/apps/erghis-first/windows"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Erghis First</a></b>. We’ve written this software to support the <a href=""http://www.leapmotion.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leap Motion Controller</a>, a small device that plugs into your computer and creates a 3D interaction space above it. It can track the motion of your hands, and with this tracking data, we’ve been able to implement a basic version of the Sphere. It allows you to write by twisting and tapping the virtual sphere, and move the mouse by grabbing the sphere and pulling it.

This is a short video we recorded back then. The early access UI is brought up, made transparent, Hello is written… All of it completely touch-free.
</p>
</center>
<br/><br/><p>
Even though the experience was limited results were amazing, we received a lot of useful feedback via social medias, e-mails and directly on the apps page. One of the first feedbacks we received was: 
</p>
<blockquote style=""color: #9E9E9E; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;"">This is the most feature rich keyboard app that I've tried for the Leap yet. They've done a great job of understanding what the Leap tracks well and implemented a system to work with that tracking. As the tracking improves, I expect this to get better and better over time.<p>   - A. Harris from Leap Motion, August 23 2013.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But the Sphere is not just about typing in the air. It is about enabling advanced touch-free control for you. Now that we know that one of the most basic of interactions - writing - works we want to take this to the next level. With you help we can!

There is much work to be done to achieve the full vision of the Sphere. Our goal with this campaign is to put in place the technological foundation that allows the Sphere to significantly improve with each leap in sensor technology. Here is part of what we are trying to achieve by developing the Sphere. 

</p>
<br/><p>
<span style=""color: #1E9E1E; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;"">Democratizing Interaction using Sphere Styles</span><br/>

Make your personal sphere respond to you uniquely, map keys, commands, shortcuts, whole texts or whatever you want to wherever you want it. Your interaction with a machine should be as unique to you as what clothes you wear or what hairstyle you have. <br/><br/></p>
<p>
<span style=""color: #1E9E1E; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;"">Remove the need for different interfaces on different devices</span><br/>
Ever needed to use a foreign keyboard? Then you can appreciate not needing to do it again. Once you have set-up your Sphere, sync it to Erghis online and use it on any Erghis enabled device wherever your are in the world. If motion sensors get built into different devices this means also using your Sphere on TV:s, tablets, smart glasses and more. <br/><br/></p>
<p>
<span style=""color: #1E9E1E; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;"">Crossplatform architecture and API</span><br/>
Instead of making your software compatible with each sensor’s API:s on each operating system  you want to support use the Erghis API and let it take care of interpreting the sensors. Making your application touch-free enabled should not limit what OS and sensor you work on.<br/><br/></p>
<p>
<span style=""color: #1E9E1E; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;"">Decouple yourself from your computer</span><br/>
The Sphere is in your hands. Therefore you do not need to find an external object nor sit by the screen of your computer to be able to use it. Sounds incredible? There are <a href=""http://erghis.com/touch-free/list-of-sensor-makers/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">sensor technologies</a> under development that can enable this. We want the Sphere to support as many of these as possible. 

</p>
<br/><p>
Our team is small and we have worked hard to bring you Erghis First. We now need your help to implement the features below and take the Sphere to the next level. </p>
<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://erghis.com/img/timeline.png"" src="""" style=""""/><p style=""color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%; margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 0px;"">Our goal with this campaign is to gain the resources to implement these aspects of the Sphere between august 2014 and august 2015. You can read more about each below.</p>
<br/><p><span style=""color: #1E9E1E; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;"">First Sphere Upgrade</span><br/>
The sphere is an invisible object that follows your hands. Currently it is very simple: it supports writing through twisting, sliding your thumbs and tapping with the rest of your fingers. In the future it will also be able to grow and shrink, spin or be thrown away among other things. It currently supports handling 288 distinct inputs, but by mid 2015 it will be 1188. <br/><br/></p>
<p></p><div style=""float: right; width: 220px;"">

<p style=""color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%; margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 5px; margin-top: 0px;"">Take a complex system, simplify it and make it your own.</p>
</div><span style=""color: #1E9E1E; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;"">Erghis Configurator</span><br/>
The Configurator is a tool to enable your style by easily adjusting the behaviour of the sphere. Put in different characters, whole words or even lines of code in one small movement, or totally change what happens if you twist the sphere. It allows you to create truly unique interaction styles.
<br/><br/><p><span style=""color: #1E9E1E; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;"">Erghis API</span><br/>
The Erghis API will allow developers to hook up or integrate the Erghis Software into their applications; allowing shortcuts, special functions, menus twisting, turning and moving around using the Sphere. There is little need to re-work an application’s original interface, since the Sphere will support interacting with current generation software and will in the long run be available for all operating systems. If you are a software developer save money by leaving touch-free UI design to ErghisTech and maintain focus on your core functionality.
</p>
<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://erghis.com/img/580x309robotcontrol.png"" src="""" style=""""/><p style=""color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%; margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 0px;"">Do you have a third-party application that needs special gestures to be controlled? Is it not enough to manipulate the Sphere?  Use the API to allow your users to seamlessly move between the Sphere and your app-specific set of gestures.  </p>
<br/><p><span style=""color: #1E9E1E; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;"">Erghis Online</span><br/>
Upload the styles you have created with the configurator and share them with others or take part in current touch-free fashions. Find language settings, application adaptations or just cooler ways of interacting. Forget the days when  corporate employees designed keyboard layouts that fit everyone equally but nobody perfectly. 
</p>
<p>Also this will stop you from ever needing to learn a new keyboard layout again. Go to an Erghis enabled device anywhere, log on and within seconds you will be back to using your own style.
<br/><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: #1E9E1E; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;"">Erghis Interface</span><br/>
The sphere is designed to work without visual feedback once you have learnt it, which frees up your display and in time allows you to move away from your computer. Until then it needs an intuitive way to teach you. When you are a pro it will allow you to use it as a reference in case you feel unsure or want to experiment with new ways of interacting. It will always be there for you when you need it, but never in the way when you don't. The current interface, used in Erghis First, works for teaching interested people to write touch-free. However, as the Sphere gets upgraded the interface needs to be updated with it. <br/><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: #1E9E1E; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;"">Core Software</span><br/>
Part of the funding for this campaign goes to creating a special software architecture that allows us to keep the Sphere up to date on all platforms simultaneously. This will allow us to implement motion sensor hardware support rapidly. It is important that when using touch-free interaction, it is the same for you on all devices and that a software developer for any OS has the same easy way to integrate with Erghis.
</p>
<br/><p><b>With your support in reaching our goals the Sphere will have its foundations laid.</b> The first personalised Erghis Sphere styles will start to become available on Erghis Online. You will allow us to continue to develop the Sphere more effectively as we can move away from basics and develop the more fantastic aspects of it past mid 2015. Don't stop there. Help us reach our stretch goals below so that the the Sphere gets even better by the end of our project schedule. </p>

<hr style=""margin-top: 20px;""/><br/><br/><p>Do you have questions? Maybe we have answered them in our Q&amp;A. </p>
<h1 style=""color: #1E9E1E; font-size: 22pt; line-height: 25pt;"">Q &amp; A</h1>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: What is the Sphere?
<br/>A:</span> It is a software interface between you and your computer that uses a third party sensor to interpret you hand movements.The Sphere is an imagined object that helps you to make a great number of different gestures without needing to learn all of them by heart. It is not actually there. When you pretend to rotate the Sphere, the computer registers this using a sensor (such as the Leap Motion Controller) and acts as if there really was a Sphere in your hands. As a result, your computer will perform different actions for you without you having touched it at all.
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: What can I do with the Sphere?
<br/>A:</span> Using the software available today you can type and move the mouse and click things completely touch-free. As ErghisTech develops we will make the Sphere smarter, making it able to understand a myriad of different manipulations. Some examples are twisting, pulling, throwing it. More importantly you will be able to re-configure how the Sphere acts when you perform these actions to truly make computer interaction your own.
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: How does the Sphere sense movement?
<br/>A:</span> It does not. The software relies on you having a third-party sensor to provide it with data about your movements. An example is the Leap Motion Controller.
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: How will I see the Sphere?
<br/>A:</span> You will be able to see the Sphere on your computer’s display with a depiction of your hands holding it. 
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: Do I need to see the Sphere to use it?
<br/>A:</span>  No, the visualization is purely for learning and reference. As long as you can imagine holding it you will be fine. Once you have learned how the Sphere works, you will be able to use it without feedback - through proprioception. 
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: Propriocep-what?
<br/>A:</span> Proprioception is your brain’s ability to know where your body parts are and what they are doing. 
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: Don't I need tactile feedback with touch-free technology?
<br/>A:</span> No, your brain was never wired to expect a sense of touch when handling imaginary objects. By seeing your mid-air movements result in actions on the screen and hearing the sounds of the Sphere you will gain enough feedback.
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: Is it difficult to use?
<br/>A:</span> Yes and No. The Sphere is unlike anything you have ever tried before, as such you will need to get used to it. Our in-house tests on our very limited early access software 'Erghis First' has revealed that most people are able to learn how to use it in less than 10 minutes. The longest has been 17 minutes so far. As sensor technology becomes better, this time will decrease significantly. Together with the GUI:s discussed in the campaign above it will become even faster.
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: What makes the Erghis Sphere easy to learn?
<br/>A:</span> Since everyone can imagine holding a sphere, it is very easy to begin. The software will be programmed to display a depiction of your hands on-screen and show you the Sphere. Then simple visual cues on-screen can hint at how you can manipulate it. When you move your hands it instantly reacts and you see the results of your interaction. Essentially, learning from there is like playing a game. 
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: What does the Sphere look like?
<br/>A:</span> The Sphere does not exist outside your computer. However, you can select different styles for the appearance of the Sphere on-screen and even design your own. You will be able not just to configure your Sphere’s output but also change its appearance.
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: Can I use this already today?
<br/>A:</span> An 'early access' version of the Sphere is available that allows you to write and control your mouse using a Leap Motion Controller as a sensor. If you have one already you can download the app <a href=""https://airspace.leapmotion.com/apps/erghis-first/windows"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. You can get a controller and support developing the Sphere at the same time by selecting it as a reward.
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: Where can I find this sensor you are talking about?
<br/>A:</span> Currently we only support the Leap Motion Controller. You can support our campaign and try out the latest in touch-free by selecting it as a reward in this campaign. If you want to know more about what is coming on the market check out this list.
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: Why do a Sphere when you could just project a keyboard on a surface? 
<br/>A:</span> A keyboard on a surface mixes all the problems of a touch-screen keyboard with the ergonomic issues of an actual keyboard. Also your brain expects tactile feedback making the experience feel difficult and unnatural.
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: I don't see what problem this solves!? Why should I care?
<br/>A:</span> As new technology develops that allows better hand and finger tracking, touch-free interaction becomes a more feasible alternative to traditional input methods - especially for portable or wearable smart devices. Currently touch-free interaction is only used for simple commands, but as it becomes more commonly used, the demand for more complex interaction (such as writing) will increase. To meet this demand, there is a need for an interface that’s both easy to learn, and easy to use. The Sphere provides a way of interacting with touch-free enabled devices that allows complex interaction without a steep learning curve.
 </p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: Will the Sphere support writing in other languages than English? 
<br/>A:</span> Yes. The Erghis Configurator will allow any kind of input to be mapped to the different taps, twists and squeezes you make on your Sphere. 
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: How can I configure my Sphere?
<br/>A:</span> The Erghis Configurator will provide an interface to change the behaviour of your sphere. Configuring it means to adjust sensitivities, change the keymaps’ content, adding custom commands, switching between analog and digital modes and activating/deactivating whole sets of manipulations of the Sphere.
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: I don't speak English very well, will I be able to use the Erghis Sphere?
<br/>A:</span> Eventually you will, yes. We will make a interface free of text that helps you learn visually without the need to read a guide. Speed up development of this by helping    us reach our stretch goals.
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: What are smart glasses and how can the Sphere be used with them?
<br/>A:</span>  Smart glasses are computers built into glasses. Their tiny size means that interaction with them becomes difficult using traditional touch-based methods. Click <a href=""http://erghis.com/touch-free/smart-glass-solutions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> to see some examples of smart glass solutions.
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: I am an application developer, how would the Erghis Sphere help me?
<br/>A:</span> The Erghis Sphere provides a customizable foundation for a touch-free interface. Instead of developing your own set of gestures for your users to learn, you can use the Erghis API to hook your application’s specific functionality into the Sphere. For the users, this means that your application will work in the same way they are used to. For you, it means you don’t have to spend time working on the touch-free interaction; you can focus on the core functionality of your software.
<br/><br/>
You won’t have to worry about developing for different sensor hardware either. By using the Erghis API, your application will work with any sensor technology supported by the Sphere.

What if you could interact with any smart device using your personal style of interaction? What if this was easy to learn, gives you exact control and unlimited possibilities? This is the vision of the Erghis Sphere, a complete re-imagining of touch-free interfaces. As simple as holding a sphere. 


ErghisTech is a Swedish startup working on creating a software program that leverages third-party motion sensor data output to simulate an invisible sphere that follows your hands. By using a virtual object instead of discrete gestures it allows you to achieve advanced touchless interaction without a large learning curve. We imagine a future where motion sensors are built into ever smaller computers and you use the Erghis Sphere to control them. 

""For the computer this is a set of gestures, for you it is a magical object that gives you unique personalised control.""

The Magic of Touch-Free is Here to Stay
An incredible amount of innovation has taken place the last couple of years. Devices that allow your computer to sense and interpret your movements are now a reality. First came the Kinect that enabled you to play games using your body as a controller. Then came the Leap Motion that gives you precision interaction necessary to perform more delicate functions.
The coming years several other technologies are to be released that in different ways provide your computer with eyes and ears. From now on, computers will be able to sense you and your motions. But what will this mean for the way you interact with your devices?
""What if you could use whichever sensor hardware you want and still never need to learn a new style of interaction?""



Currently, each touch-free application uses its own set of gestures, and quite often, different apps use the same gesture to mean different things. To use touchless technologies you'll have to learn each app's particular set of gestures, and the more complicated the interaction, the more gestures you'll have to learn. 
This will only get worse as more apps and sensors become available. What if instead you could use whichever sensor hardware you want and still never need to learn a new style of interaction?
""As simple as holding a Sphere"":  Using third-party sensors, the Erghis Software simulates a Sphere that you can  use to control your computer.  Many companies are working on touch-free. See a list here.
We at ErghisTech really see the potential in touch-free interaction, and we want to make it as useful as possible. By focussing on developing an easy-to-learn, easy-to-use interface and leaving the sensing hardware to others, we have produced a concept that allows powerful interaction, without making it hard to learn.
How? It’s simple, really. Instead of trying to remember loads of different gestures, just imagine that you’re holding a sphere in your hands. Now gestures like twisting, pulling or tapping the sphere will come naturally. Each of these can then be mapped to a character or command. A visualization of the sphere on your computer display (or through your smart glasses) will show you how it reacts to you. Interacting with your smart devices will no longer feel like it’s being done through a series of gestures, but by manipulating an object in your hands, as if it were actually there.
Use a third-party sensor to detect your hands and the Erghis software to interpret your gestures, and the virtual sphere becomes a powerful yet easy-to-use touch-free interface between you and your smart devices. 
Sensor technology will eventually be built into smart-glasses. What if they supported the Sphere? Take a look at some smart glasses here.
The world is at a crossroads. The technology that gives your computer eyes is still too young for big corporations to invest in full interaction systems. There is a historical opportunity to create an interface that is independent democratic and based in people. Help us help you avoid standardized difficult to use and learn gesture systems. Help us to quite literally put touch-free interaction into your hands.
Our Prototype

We wanted to see how people would react to using an imaginary sphere for their computer interaction, so we developed a prototype for Windows: Erghis First. We’ve written this software to support the Leap Motion Controller, a small device that plugs into your computer and creates a 3D interaction space above it. It can track the motion of your hands, and with this tracking data, we’ve been able to implement a basic version of the Sphere. It allows you to write by twisting and tapping the virtual sphere, and move the mouse by grabbing the sphere and pulling it. 



We released our early access software in August 2013 and have since been gathering feedback. This is a short video we recorded back then. The early access UI is brought up, made transparent, Hello is written… All of it completely touch-free.



Even though the experience was limited results were amazing, we received a lot of useful feedback via social medias, e-mails and directly on the apps page. One of the first feedbacks we received was: 

This is the most feature rich keyboard app that I've tried for the Leap yet. They've done a great job of understanding what the Leap tracks well and implemented a system to work with that tracking. As the tracking improves, I expect this to get better and better over time.   - A. Harris from Leap Motion, August 23 2013.


But the Sphere is not just about typing in the air. It is about enabling advanced touch-free control for you. Now that we know that one of the most basic of interactions - writing - works we want to take this to the next level. With you help we can!


Using our early access app to write erghis.com into a browser. You can try it out on a Windows PC with a Leap Motion controller via the Airspace Software store.  


Erghis First is available to download for anyone via Leap Motion Airspace. Just like there is a software store on your phone - ‘App Store’ on Iphones or ‘Google Play’ on Android - Airspace allows you to purchase software for the Leap Motion Controller. You can find Erghis First and read about how you use it for writing and mouse control here.




Where do we take it from here?



There is much work to be done to achieve the full vision of the Sphere. Our goal with this campaign is to put in place the technological foundation that allows the Sphere to significantly improve with each leap in sensor technology. Here is part of what we are trying to achieve by developing the Sphere. 



Democratizing Interaction using Sphere Styles

Make your personal sphere respond to you uniquely, map keys, commands, shortcuts, whole texts or whatever you want to wherever you want it. Your interaction with a machine should be as unique to you as what clothes you wear or what hairstyle you have. 

Remove the need for different interfaces on different devices
Ever needed to use a foreign keyboard? Then you can appreciate not needing to do it again. Once you have set-up your Sphere, sync it to Erghis online and use it on any Erghis enabled device wherever your are in the world. If motion sensors get built into different devices this means also using your Sphere on TV:s, tablets, smart glasses and more. 

Crossplatform architecture and API
Instead of making your software compatible with each sensor’s API:s on each operating system  you want to support use the Erghis API and let it take care of interpreting the sensors. Making your application touch-free enabled should not limit what OS and sensor you work on.

Decouple yourself from your computer
The Sphere is in your hands. Therefore you do not need to find an external object nor sit by the screen of your computer to be able to use it. Sounds incredible? There are sensor technologies under development that can enable this. We want the Sphere to support as many of these as possible. 



Our team is small and we have worked hard to bring you Erghis First. We now need your help to implement the features below and take the Sphere to the next level. 
Our goal with this campaign is to gain the resources to implement these aspects of the Sphere between august 2014 and august 2015. You can read more about each below.
First Sphere Upgrade
The sphere is an invisible object that follows your hands. Currently it is very simple: it supports writing through twisting, sliding your thumbs and tapping with the rest of your fingers. In the future it will also be able to grow and shrink, spin or be thrown away among other things. It currently supports handling 288 distinct inputs, but by mid 2015 it will be 1188. 



Take a complex system, simplify it and make it your own.
Erghis Configurator
The Configurator is a tool to enable your style by easily adjusting the behaviour of the sphere. Put in different characters, whole words or even lines of code in one small movement, or totally change what happens if you twist the sphere. It allows you to create truly unique interaction styles.
Erghis API
The Erghis API will allow developers to hook up or integrate the Erghis Software into their applications; allowing shortcuts, special functions, menus twisting, turning and moving around using the Sphere. There is little need to re-work an application’s original interface, since the Sphere will support interacting with current generation software and will in the long run be available for all operating systems. If you are a software developer save money by leaving touch-free UI design to ErghisTech and maintain focus on your core functionality.

Do you have a third-party application that needs special gestures to be controlled? Is it not enough to manipulate the Sphere?  Use the API to allow your users to seamlessly move between the Sphere and your app-specific set of gestures.  
Erghis Online
Upload the styles you have created with the configurator and share them with others or take part in current touch-free fashions. Find language settings, application adaptations or just cooler ways of interacting. Forget the days when  corporate employees designed keyboard layouts that fit everyone equally but nobody perfectly. 

Also this will stop you from ever needing to learn a new keyboard layout again. Go to an Erghis enabled device anywhere, log on and within seconds you will be back to using your own style.

Erghis Interface
The sphere is designed to work without visual feedback once you have learnt it, which frees up your display and in time allows you to move away from your computer. Until then it needs an intuitive way to teach you. When you are a pro it will allow you to use it as a reference in case you feel unsure or want to experiment with new ways of interacting. It will always be there for you when you need it, but never in the way when you don't. The current interface, used in Erghis First, works for teaching interested people to write touch-free. However, as the Sphere gets upgraded the interface needs to be updated with it. 
Core Software
Part of the funding for this campaign goes to creating a special software architecture that allows us to keep the Sphere up to date on all platforms simultaneously. This will allow us to implement motion sensor hardware support rapidly. It is important that when using touch-free interaction, it is the same for you on all devices and that a software developer for any OS has the same easy way to integrate with Erghis.

With your support in reaching our goals the Sphere will have its foundations laid. The first personalised Erghis Sphere styles will start to become available on Erghis Online. You will allow us to continue to develop the Sphere more effectively as we can move away from basics and develop the more fantastic aspects of it past mid 2015. Don't stop there. Help us reach our stretch goals below so that the the Sphere gets even better by the end of our project schedule. 
Stretch Goals
Each stretch goal we reach enables us to add the below functionality 
to the Erghis Sphere already by the end of our schedule of 
mid-2015. 


$40,000

Text-Free Interface
We want to give you an interface where you don't have to read anything 
to learn. Such an interface makes the Sphere accessible for everyone 
across the world independent of their age or language. 




$60,000

Second Sphere Upgrade
The Sphere is currently built around discrete movements. Help us make it
 understand analog movements as well. Developers can connect API 
functions to see ""how much you twist"" the Sphere to create a whole new 
level of possibilities in customizing the Sphere. Also activate and 
de-activate the Sphere by growing it between your hands when you need it
 and throwing it away when you are done.






$80,000

Free the Sphere!
Just like it sounds. The 'Erghis First' software will be released for free when this goal is achieved. Through updates it will grow into the finished Sphere software. The reason we charge for it currently is to fund the development of the very features we are crowdfunding.



$100,000

Mirror-like 3D-interface
Reaching this target will enable us to hire a dedicated 
3D-programmer and artist to make the Sphere come alive in a true 3D 
interface. This will let you see your hands with the Sphere alive 
between them onscreen and make learning intuitive and game-like. 


$150,000

OSX or Linux Support by Mid 2015


With the software architecture in place, it will be easy to enable 
OSX/Linux support, however it will need many months of programming. This
 stretch goal will allow us to hire extra hands to bring the Sphere to 
OSX/Linux already by mid 2015. Which OS do you want ported first? Make 
your voice heard, Vote!

Vote and show your support by selecting Linux Sphere or OSX Sphere here.



$200,000

Both OSX and Linux Support by Mid 2015


This stretch goal will allow us to bring the Sphere to the second of these operating systems.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a small team of two based in Pretoria, South Africa, with big dreams. Ishe is the one who came up with the revolutionary idea of Bounz and Gerhard is responsible for making things happen.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530945688/eocsqxhae9eslodotxam.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Ishe realised that most people are very creative and should not be limited to only being able to share posts with people that happen to follow them. This denies both them and their posts the attention that they deserve, but all of this can be changed by allowing posts to ""bounz"". What this means is that when you see something you like, you can pull it down so that it ""bounzes"" to everyone you follow and this process can continue until everyone in the world is reached!</p>
<p>We wanted to create a platform that is truly open and specifically for expressing creativity. In the present climate of privacy violation, our solution is very simple - no privacy. Bounz is specifically for posting content you want to share with complete strangers and nothing else. There is no confusion and no risk!</p>
<p>Having taught himself the art of computer programming at the age of 10, Gerhard now has about a decade's worth of valuable experience in software development and all the know how to get the app done. In fact, he has managed to single handedly develop the app to where it is now including all manners of programming and even graphic design!</p>
<p>Unfortunately Gerhard is only one man, specially one who is also trying to get through a university engineering degree and he has realised that there is just no way he will ever get this app finished on his own.</p>
<p>We have tried to get other student programmers to help but just could not get anyone suitable. We have also tried exhaustively to get traditional funding but we found that unfortunately South African investors are a bit too conservative to invest in groundbreaking social apps.</p>
<p>Finally we realised that there is a better way to get the app done, we can ask the wonderful people ❤️ who will be using it for some help!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529840131/nyidsgfsnverhobfybjd.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What Makes Bounz Different</strong></h3>
<p>If you have come this far (and hopefully watched the video) you might be wondering what makes Bounz different from say Instagram or even Twitter. At first sight a ""bounz"" might not look very different from a ""like"" or a ""share"".  The reason for this is quite simple, a ""bounz"" is both a ""like"" and a ""share"" at the same time.</p>
<p>The idea behind Bounz is that all of its users will form a community of people who want to view and help spread creative visual content (AKA posts). What this means is that if you like a post, you express your liking by making it ""bounz"" which then shares it to all your followers and makes it reach more people because it is likeable.</p>
<p>The real difference here is that Bounz is actually quite impersonal and centred solely around sharing awesome posts. Bounz creates an almost game-like experience where the goal is to share as much worthy content as possible through a fun and interactive bouncing motion.</p>
<p>Still not getting it? The significance of Bounz being so focused on sharing creative visual content with as many people as possible is that your creativity will not get buried in vast amounts of traditional social interactions (what exisitng platforms focus on) and be left unnoticed. Instead, they will be set free!</p>
<h3>Won't They Just Copy Us?</h3>
<p>It might seem like an obvious risk that a place like Instagram can quite simply copy our unique bouncing motion. Firstly we would like to point out that this would be a very lame and somewhat desperate thing of anyone to  do... Secondly though, Bounz is about more than just the motion, Bounz is about being an entire platform focused on sharing and promoting creative content. The only way to copy Bounz would be to copy it in its entirety, It cannot exist as simply part of a larger platform.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Because we have continued to develop the app whilst in search of funding we have actually gotten it quite far but there is still a healthy amount of work left.</p>
<p>We have estimated to the best of our ability that there is about 250 hours of development work left on the app of which most is back-end related and necessary to ensure the smooth running of our service irrespective of the (hopefully massive) workload.</p>
<p>We also have one major outstanding feature that we need to develop. This is the ability to filter posts based on topics. We have realised that without such filtering, users would soon become overwhelmed by posts that they do not care to see. Our simple solution is to give users the ability to specify what topics they want to allow into their field and have others specify topics while posting. Lastly, you will also be able to search for posts (even ones you have not received yet) based on topics.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530638524/u3uvtkfy0jcqykefv7qt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A significant part of the work that stills needs to be done is the completion of a comprehensive and robust system for the reporting and removal of inappropriate content. This is of course very important on a platform where everything is open and because it can never be entirely automated we will need to hire people to oversee it. Thus far we can reliable block all kinds of nudity but work is needed on things like graphic and verbal violence detection.</p>
<p>A fairly complicated feature that is already complete but still worth mentioning as a result of its awesomeness is our entirely real-time architecture. You never have to refresh anything, every piece of data that you can look at updates immediately as it is changed. We chose to implement our app this way because we would personally not be happy with anything less!</p>
<p>Beyond the technical requirements, as neither of us have legal degrees, we will need to pay for a significant amount of legal advice to set up numerous policies and make sure that everything we do is in the clear so that we do not have to shut down prematurely.</p>
<p>Our ""mention"" and ""badge"" type perks are all about helping you, our very special supporters, stand out on a platform that is bound to become huge. Being mentioned on either our website or inside the app itself will mean that you are in eternal halls of fame. Badges though will proclaim your profound support of the platform to anyone who views your profile.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530646889/hboux1ir61fgktac7cjq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If you opt to buy one of the perks for beta access then you will of course be able to experience this amazing app before anyone else on the planet! Oh and the reason why the iOS access is so expensive is because Apple limits the amount of places we can give out...</p>
<p>The other perks should be pretty self explanatory.</p>
<p>Once past the beta phase of course everyone will have access to the revolutionary app known as Bounz all thanks to your generous contribution!</p>
<p>If you are a bit selfish though and don't want to pay for something that others will be getting for free, think of it this way, the more users there are, the more people can appreciate your breathtaking posts...</p>
<p>As you might have noticed, we do not have traditional physical merchandise like T-shirts etc. (aka ""swag"") on offer as part of our perks lineup. The reason for this is quite simple and goes by the name of ""logistics"". We are only two people (for now) and trying to get such items shipped globally is a huge amount of work and introduces financial risks aplenty. Quite simply we cannot afford to distract ourselves from our main goal for such novelties at the moment. If we receive enough feedback requesting such items, we will reconsider. </p>
<p>According to our calculations and based on current developer rates, the amount of money we hope to raise should be enough to cover all planned development, other costs and serve as a bit of a buffer for unexpected expenses. Should we receive less money, we will use it to develop as much as we can but there will be a real risk of someone bringing a clone to market before us. If we raise more money, we will be able to work faster than planned and even introduce some extra features very soon.</p>
<p>Below is our timeline for the project including what has been done and what is being planned:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529842046/mafd7dek6tpqr4a8m9kv.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The ultimate benefit of this app will be to you, the end user!</p>
<p>The reason we believe this is because through our free app you will finally be able to have your creative side embraced by a far greater audience than your immediate social circles.</p>
<p>Through our fun ""bounz"" action you will also be able to help the creative content of others to reach the audience that it deserves.</p>
<p>We are completely open to the idea of offering paid subscriptions instead of/alongside ads if we get enough feedback showing interest in this. Unlike many of the existing players, we really don't have any desire to exploit your personal data for personal profit, we just need some form of income to keep our app running and initially we will be sticking to the industry standard.</p>
<p>Finally, we are not trying to replace existing social platforms by providing similar features and promoting the sharing of personal information. Instead we are focusing on a specific social experience that we feel people have a need for but cannot currently service with existing social apps that are not tailored to this goal.</p>
<p>We hope to be a safe place for people to express their creativity and appreciate the creativity of others by letting people know that this is all that our app is about and that it is meant for public content only. If there is no confusion, there can be no risk!</p>
<p>Oh, If you are into that type of thing... we are of course an ""African"" startup being based in South Africa and all that so this this will be very much a first of its kind app for something originating in Africa. Wouldn't you want to be part of something as groundbreaking as that?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529842866/c8ur1gzzcqdbuobsrkzf.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Obviously there is a limit to how realistic our estimation of a 250 hour work deficit can be. Unexpected difficulties in the development process can completely derail our efforts and we will need some reserve development funds to get back on track in such a situation.</p>
<p>As a user, you have to understand that a social media app like this places an enormous stress on the computer infrastructure behind it and users (rightfully) expect the system to remain highly responsive despite a user-base of millions. The cost of running such a system is tremendous and as our only income will be from ads we need to make sure that the system is efficient enough before going live as to not bankrupt the company immediatly and deny you the opportunity to use this awesome app.</p>
<p>One of our biggest challenges is also our attention to detail. We simply cannot tolerate any bugs or inconsistencies in our app and this has cost us quite a bit of time already but we believe it to ultimately be to the benefit of everyone.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530642152/bumzizp5ffqr5o9i0lg4.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are not experts in the law but know that social media apps are very sensitive in that regard and as such all we know is that our legal expenses can become significant. We will try our best to ensure that we do nothing wrong and keep these expenses as low as possible as they won't really go towards making the app feel nicer for anyone.</p>
<p>Launching in Europe will also be a challenge because there are among others, many regulations about where data is stored. Getting the app translated will also take time. As such, we will unfortunately initially only be launching an English version of the app in the United States and other countries where legislation is not too prohibitive. Should our financial position allow for it, getting the apps into the hands of as many other people as possible will be a top priority.</p>
<p>Once the development challenges have been overcome, our biggest challenge will be to procure enough active usage to have advertising revenue surpass our server costs. If we cannot get this done quickly enough, we will run out of money and fail. The only solution we have for this is to ensure that the app is so good that many people will want to use it and to ask our loyal users to spread the word!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need as many people to help as possible if we are to have any change of reaching our goal. We believe that most people will be excited by our pitch and if you share this campaign with everyone you know (Indiegogo has nice tools for this), odds are some of them will be able to contribute!</p>
<p>Spreading the word about our free app will also be very important once it has launched because we need to grow fast in order to offset our costs. Just being an active user will also do wonders for this!</p>
<p>If you can be a bit lenient with your app reviews for the first few versions or so while we iron out the type of nasty bugs that only show up once in production that will also go a long way towards helping us as well.</p>
<p>We tried to think of as many perks that do not involve having to ship physical items as we can but we know that we have not thought of everything. If you have got a great idea for something else that we can offer, please do not hesitate to let us know.</p>
<p>Finally, the best way to for us to avoid unnecessary legal costs would be for no-one to sue us senseless for no good reason...</p>

Unlike many of the existing players, we really don't have any desire to exploit your personal data for personal profit, we just need some form of income to keep our app running and initially we will be sticking to the industry standard.
Finally, we are not trying to replace existing social platforms by providing similar features and promoting the sharing of personal information. Instead we are focusing on a specific social experience that we feel people have a need for but cannot currently service with existing social apps that are not tailored to this goal.
We hope to be a safe place for people to express their creativity and appreciate the creativity of others by letting people know that this is all that our app is about and that it is meant for public content only. If there is no confusion, there can be no risk!
Oh, If you are into that type of thing... we are of course an ""African"" startup being based in South Africa and all that so this this will be very much a first of its kind app for something originating in Africa. Wouldn't you want to be part of something as groundbreaking as that?


Risks & Challenges
Obviously there is a limit to how realistic our estimation of a 250 hour work deficit can be. Unexpected difficulties in the development process can completely derail our efforts and we will need some reserve development funds to get back on track in such a situation.
As a user, you have to understand that a social media app like this places an enormous stress on the computer infrastructure behind it and users (rightfully) expect the system to remain highly responsive despite a user-base of millions. The cost of running such a system is tremendous and as our only income will be from ads we need to make sure that the system is efficient enough before going live as to not bankrupt the company immediatly and deny you the opportunity to use this awesome app.
One of our biggest challenges is also our attention to detail. We simply cannot tolerate any bugs or inconsistencies in our app and this has cost us quite a bit of time already but we believe it to ultimately be to the benefit of everyone.

We are not experts in the law but know that social media apps are very sensitive in that regard and as such all we know is that our legal expenses can become significant. We will try our best to ensure that we do nothing wrong and keep these expenses as low as possible as they won't really go towards making the app feel nicer for anyone.
Launching in Europe will also be a challenge because there are among others, many regulations about where data is stored. Getting the app translated will also take time. As such, we will unfortunately initially only be launching an English version of the app in the United States and other countries where legislation is not too prohibitive. Should our financial position allow for it, getting the apps into the hands of as many other people as possible will be a top priority.
Once the development challenges have been overcome, our biggest challenge will be to procure enough active usage to have advertising revenue surpass our server costs. If we cannot get this done quickly enough, we will run out of money and fail. The only solution we have for this is to ensure that the app is so good that many people will want to use it and to ask our loyal users to spread the word!

Other Ways You Can Help
We need as many people to help as possible if we are to have any change of reaching our goal. We believe that most people will be excited by our pitch and if you share this campaign with everyone you know (Indiegogo has nice tools for this), odds are some of them will be able to contribute!
Spreading the word about our free app will also be very important once it has launched because we need to grow fast in order to offset our costs. Just being an active user will also do wonders for this!
If you can be a bit lenient with your app reviews for the first few versions or so while we iron out the type of nasty bugs that only show up once in production that will also go a long way towards helping us as well.
We tried to think of as many perks that do not involve having to ship physical items as we can but we know that we have not thought of everything. If you have got a great idea for something else that we can offer, please do not hesitate to let us know.
Finally, the best way to for us to avoid unnecessary legal costs would be for no-one to sue us senseless for no good reason...",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

Sometimes an entrepreneur comes along that just “gets it”. They seem to have a natural knack for creating businesses and making a success out of them. 



Deka Bluetooth headsets aren't only unique but we're also on a mission and that's to encourage people to be hands free while driving. So, we started our Hands Free Me® initiative, where people can take the pledge to keep their hands on the steering while driving.


When you're on the road, you're going to fall in love with driving again. That's because you can now be fashionable with your own personalized Deka Bluetooth headset. Not only does Deka give you reliable Bluetooth connection, comfort and great sound quality but also fits your lifestyle.
That was easy right? Now your turn. Just point your camera and take a picture. The sky's the limit. Pictures can be of your dog, cat, favorite sport, company logo, or anything that you can imagine.
 


 Take a picture of whatever you want. Next, just send us that picture. We'll create your favorite artwork, hobby, animal and custom image. If you can think it, we can make it.



The Deka isn't just a Bluetooth, it's an accessory that you can make a fashion statement. Imagine if you can wear a Bluetooth as part of your outfit. Wouldn't that be cool? Go ahead and be different. Be a fashion icon.
To own a Deka, you're a trendsetter. The Deka is designed for everyone that wants a device that reflects their personality or personal style. You can be stylish and successful - with the Deka, the world will know it. The Deka Bluetooth headset is more than just a personal communication device. It's one of the smartest Bluetooth headset in the market. When we decided to build the Deka, we wanted to make sure that when we combined beauty, there had to be a smart technology component. So, we came up with a mobile app for the Deka that lets you do more than just change out designs. With the Deka Smart Mobile App, you can take advantage of the LED lighting system that we've integrated into our Bluetooth. Here are just some of the features that you can do with your Deka Smart Mobile App: Deka uses the latest in noise cancellation technology. Never miss a word or beat in a crowded place. Deka is the perfect on the go companion for a phone call, listening to music or an audio book. Never fear water again. Moisture from sweat and accidental drops of water are the main causes for damage to Bluetooth headsets. With the Deka Bluetooth headset, it's important that we protect your technology investments. That's why the Deka is coated with Liquipel's water safe technology.  All of these features are currently in development and sent out to a small group of private alpha testers. For example, we're currently working on a beat detection feature that will rhythmically respond to moods. We plan to provide our Deka mobile app as soon as we've ironed out all the kinks to the rest out our backers. At Deka, we're thinking outside the box to build our Bluetooth headsets as not only a smart wearable technology but a lifestyle device.Just mix and match. Show off your favorite designs. From country flags to artistic designs, the possibilities are limitless. You can send us designs from your child's first drawings, musicians or company logos...The Deka is just fun and fashionable. Using the Deka Slide (3D or Canvas Caps), putting one on is simple. Just attach any Deka Slide onto a Deka Bluetooth base unit and go. No hassles or headaches. The Deka has been a dream concept for a few years. It wasn't until recently that our breakthrough moment came when we discovered that a round base was the path to interchangeability. In this section, we'll show you our engineering and design story at work. Let's start with the technical specifications below:   To become the world's smartest Bluetooth, the Deka is raising the bar for the future of wearable technologies. The Deka Bluetooth is one of the most advanced wearable device on the market with next generation technology features such as voice command, touch sensitive power on/off, caller ID, video game compatibility, and RGB LED lighting beat detection.  The Deka Bluetooth headset is about the same size as a quarter. As a wireless Bluetooth headset, Deka will be one of the smallest and lightest on the market. However, what it packs inside is what matters: noise cancelation, HD quality sound, water safe, Bluetooth 3.0, LED lighting and more. Deka is small enough to be comfortable in your ear but big enough to make a statement.  These are some of our early design concepts. We started out with small tweaks to an industry standard, where each Deka was a dedicated design to a Bluetooth unit. Then, one day we had our eureka moment, when we asked, what if people wanted the ability to change designs. Is that possible? That one question lead us to the image designs below. This is our breakthrough design that led to Deka becoming the world's first customizable Bluetooth headset, where you can interchange between various designs. Once we knew that we were onto something, we then did our research and found that this was our groundbreaking moment. We filed out patents and immediately started working on our first round Deka Base prototypes. This rounded shaped is the key to having the ability to swap out various Deka Slides.  We designed and grew our first interchangeable Deka Skull Slide. This design then led us to create other elaborate Deka 3D slides. From flowers, butterflies to popular sports, we knew the possibilities were going to be endless. It was from those brainstorm sessions that we thought this idea would be a great crowdfunding concept. Now, let's imagine if the entire world was able to reimagine what Bluetooth can look like. What if the world thought outside the box? What if fashionable Bluetooth was worldwide? What if the world can discover Bluetooth and how cool it can be. That's our dream. With this crowdfunding campaign, we want the world to know that Bluetooth does not have to be boring anymore. Our vision is to bring the idea to everyone that Bluetooth headset can be fun and fashionable.So if you have ideas for a Deka Slide design, we can make it. If you want us to help you with this, the process is simple. Just contact us and we will create your very own custom Bluetooth headset.How the process works? Easy. Creating a design is as simple as coming up with an idea, submitting that to us and we'll help you make your custom Bluetooth come to life. If you have questions, just contact us for details.As a Bluetooth headset, Deka is just as technologically advanced as the premium brands on the market but affordable. The suggested retail price will be roughly about $69.99. We'll know more about our final price once we're able to put in our first production run order. However, what makes Deka unique is our limitless design possibilities. Deka is about creating a community and marketplace for artists and designers. If you can think it, it can be printed. With Deka, you'll never be stuck with the same old boring Bluetooth headset again.   Need an easy way to understand our perk levels? Here's a diagram to give you a reference point. NOTE: THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION WILL BE IN GOLD. If you still have questions, please refer to our FAQs below or contact us at support@dekasounds.comFact #1: In 1994 a group of engineers at Ericsson, a Swedish company, invented a wireless communication technology, later called Bluetooth. In 1998, the original group of Promoter companies—Ericsson, Intel, Nokia, Toshiba and IBM -- came together to form the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). Since no single company owns the technology, the SIG member companies work together to preserve, educate, and further Bluetooth technology as a means to bring devices into the connected world.Fact #2: Distraction has been identified as a contributing factor in 22% of car crashes and near crashes and 71% of truck crashes (and 46% of near crashes) in naturalistic driving studies.Fact #3: Using a mobile phone while driving is highly distracting and increases your risk of a crash four-fold.Fact #4: One of the fastest growing Bluetooth devices is “Bluetooth hands free ” and the second largest global application, just behind the hands free is the Bluetooth stereo audio. Fact #5: Bluetooth wireless technology is built into billions of products, from cars and mobile phones to medical devices and computers and even forks and toothbrushes. Bluetooth technology allows you to share voice, data, music, photos, videos and other information wirelessly between paired devices.Fact #6: The name ""Bluetooth"" comes from the 10th century Danish King Harald Blåtand or Harold Bluetooth in English.Fact #7: Mobile phones, FM radio and television all use radio waves to send information wirelessly. And while Bluetooth technology also uses radio waves, it transmits them over a shorter distance. This is Bluetooth reimagined. Whatever your hobbies and interests are, the Deka can be your self-expression personal communication device. The Deka is truly a unique product that gives us the option that we've always lacked with Bluetooth devices. We currently have a working prototype and we're now focused on:
Finalizing the engineering schematics for the final product
Developing and iterating on the user experience for the mobile app
Optimizing the sound sensor
Integration of streaming music service to work with our sound sensor
Finalizing the product technical specifications
We will soon begin the process of:
Packaging Design for Retail
Filing product certifications
Designing the supply chain process
Material Tooling
Materials procurement

</div></div>","Hi,

I've always been passionate about sports and active lifestyle. While attempting to track and measure my performance I ended up with a bag of sensors: foot pod for running and X-country skiing, speed and cadence for cycling, one for tennis, one for golf, two for swimming and three for rowing. 
Why can't I have one sensor which reliably measures all my activities? 




There are many motion sensors on the market. Most of them use accelerometer or gyro or both. 3DmotionTM Smart Sensor uses Earth magnetic field sensing technology. It draws very little power and is not susceptible to any shock nor vibrations.The Earth magnetic field sensing technology works like a compass. When you rotate a compass the arrow is always pointing to the North Pole. If you attach the compass to your arm or a leg or any object you could measure its orientation and motion relative to the North Pole. 3DmotionTM Smart Sensor uses 3-axis electronic compass and can measure any pivotal motion in 3D. It works reliably anywhere on earth. Maybe not on the North Pole.
We already have a Smart Sensor which uses Earth magnetic field
sensing technology to measure  cycling speed    and cadence  



VeloComputer.com


               

VeloComputerTM  app on AndroidTM  SmartPhone and SmartWatch
    

  The new firmware will support the
standard and    



profile for running speed    or pace and cadence    steps per minute SPM. You could use it with existing
sport watches and apps supporting these standard profiles:

Android, Android Wear, Android Smartwatch, Apple Watch, iPhone, iPod  apps for running which uses Bluetooth Smart  running speed and cadence profile (RSCP)


AlpineSportTM





Adidas, Beurer, Garmin, Motorola, O-synce, Suunto, Timex
            

The new Bluetooth Smart profile for water sports: swimming, rowing, paddling, kayaking, surf skiing, canoeing, outrigger and stand up paddleboarding (SUP) will be released in spring of 2016 together with Android and Android Wear or Smartwatch apps. iPhone and Apple Watch apps will be released later in summer.
Developers




You can use Bluetooth Smart  UART profile via SDK to see how the Earth magnetic field sensing technology works in 3D. See UART examples.



Other Bluetooth Smart profiles supported: Battery, DIS, DFU for over-the-air firmware updates. Together we create new profiles for other sports.

   Our Goal
Provide you with a single 3DmotionTM Smart Sensor  for all sports. 
You will get a sensor for cycling, running and water sports which you could wirelessly update in the future with new sport profiles as they are becoming
available.

us in this 3D motion revolution!

<h3 align=""center"">Multiple Factors of Authentication</h3>
</div>
<p>The use of multi-factor authentication provides a much more secure login process requiring more than just a simple username and password.</p>
<p>Unlike other products currently on the market that provide 2 or 3 factors of authentication, LeVAULT will provide numerous factors of authentication well beyond 3 factors. </p>
</div><p>LeVAULT supports multiple factors of authentication through the following:</p><ul><li>
<strong>Something you have</strong>: A registered key</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>This “registered key” can be ANY device that is detected by a computer (mobile phone, Bluetooth device, tablet, or USB  device just to name a few) A user may have more than one registered key.</i></p><ul><li>
<strong>Something you know</strong>: <i>The methodology to login to LeVAULT is fully managed and controlled by each individual, which can include a username and password combination as well as bio-metrics. This gives you multiple factors of authentication well beyond 3 factors.</i>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<strong>Something you don’t know</strong>: A PIN number​</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>A new PIN number is sent to your cell phone or any other device. This happens upon each login request to LeVAULT. A new PIN is generated and sent each time you login to LeVAULT.</i></p><p>LeVAULT uses the above factors in conjunction with our easy to use password generation and management system. This makes accessing your private information very secure.

<li>Users and employees are added and deactivated from LeVAULT by an administrator with the right privileges.</li>
<li>Applications, web sites, devices and other resources are added to LeVAULT by an administrator with the right privileges.</li>
<li>Additional services and solutions can be developed through the use of the LeVAULT API.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Is there high availability built in the architecture?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The LeVAULT Authentication Server (LAS) can be hosted on Google servers, Amazon (AWS), blue host, etc.</li>
<li>The LeVAULT Authentication Server (LAS) can be hosted internally and managed, by a business or entity.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Is there failover and redundancy built in?</strong></p>
<ul><li>LeVAULT manages the authentication layer; therefore, failover and redundancy are supported by LeVAULT.</li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What is the hardware configuration and system requirements for the platform?</strong></p>
<ul><li>A standalone/virtualized server that can support a web server (e.g., Apache Tomcat).</li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What is the specific performance impact on the network for low, medium and large deployments?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On the front end, very minimal because LeVAULT simply automates the authentication process.</li>
<li>On the back end, the LAS changes the passwords, PIN numbers and encryption keys on a predetermined frequency set by the administrators. The impact on the network will be increased by the frequency of the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:0.25in;text-align: center;""><strong>Do you have a plan to support Spark or Hadoop HDFS?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LeVAULT technology could be incorporated into any platform that supports web servers (i.e. Apache Tomcat).</li>
<li>LeVAULT manages the authentication and encryption of any database engine, server configuration, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How can this system run on the edge of the network for IoT applications?</strong></p>
<ul><li>LeVAULT could be implemented at the edge of an IoT (internet of things) network. “Things” could be registered into LeVAULT through the use of the LeVAULT Administration Client. Registration, authentication and encryption will be managed by LeVAULT, insuring integrity of the private network.

<ul>
<li>HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,) does not have a specific requirement for encryption and intrusion detection, it requires that those in possession of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) protect that information and, for the most part, leaves implementation up to the technologists involved. </li>
<li>LeVAULT manages the access and authentication to applications, databases and PII.</li>
<li>The authorization to access and view PII is only allowed by those that have been given authorization to the PII.</li>
<li>Because LeVAULT manages passwords, encryption keys and PIN numbers, the sharing of such is impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What does your security stack look like?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The VPN security stack can be Cisco OS, combined with a client whose OS could be many types.</li>
<li>Our stack would be a purpose-built server, running Linux or Windows OS with support for JAVA EE, MySQL database and Apache Tomcat.  The LeVAULT Authentication Server will be hosted here.</li>
<li>In the IoT solution, the internal stack would manage the encryption and authentication scheme built into the communication protocol between the “Things” and their controller. </li>
<li>On the public facing side, we would be dependent on the stack already hosting the LeVAULT Authentication Server (LAS). There will be a LeVAULT Client with encryption, authentication, and detection running on a client device.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How is the system deployed for cloud, on-premises and hybrid environments?</strong></p>
<ul><li>LeVAULT can be either a cloud based solution, a VPN solution, or a hybrid solution. It depends on how the customer wants to implement and support the LeVAULT technology.</li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How can we test the system in an evaluation or POC?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We can provide a test environment with a limited number of users and time frame.</li>
<li>Training for the administrator to be in charge of managing and maintaining LeVAULT.</li>
<li>A full implementation will just involve increasing the total number of users.</li>

Multiple Factors of Authentication

The use of multi-factor authentication provides a much more secure login process requiring more than just a simple username and password.
Unlike other products currently on the market that provide 2 or 3 factors of authentication, LeVAULT will provide numerous factors of authentication well beyond 3 factors. 
LeVAULT supports multiple factors of authentication through the following:
Something you have: A registered keyThis “registered key” can be ANY device that is detected by a computer (mobile phone, Bluetooth device, tablet, or USB  device just to name a few) A user may have more than one registered key.
Something you know: The methodology to login to LeVAULT is fully managed and controlled by each individual, which can include a username and password combination as well as bio-metrics. This gives you multiple factors of authentication well beyond 3 factors.

Something you don’t know: A PIN number​A new PIN number is sent to your cell phone or any other device. This happens upon each login request to LeVAULT. A new PIN is generated and sent each time you login to LeVAULT.LeVAULT uses the above factors in conjunction with our easy to use password generation and management system. This makes accessing your private information very secure. The LeVAULT Authentication Server is often referred to as the ""LAS"". Password Generation and ManagementIn today’s world, computer and network security is dependent on the management, generation, and security of passwords, PIN numbers and encryption keys. Once hackers break into a system, their single, most important goal is to obtain a user login ID, passwords, PIN numbers and encryption keys.We know the following:Passwords, PIN numbers and encryption keys are too simple.Passwords, PIN numbers and encryption keys are not changed frequently enough.Passwords, PIN numbers and encryption keys are not kept in safe places. LeVAULT resolves the above by providing an unprecedented password security system that also supports encryption keys and PIN numbers. LeVAULT automates the generation and management of your passwords, PIN numbers and encryption keys. This process is broken down into two categories.Passwords, PIN numbers and encryption keys generation:LeVAULT will automatically generate strong and complex passwords for each and every one of your individual accounts.Passwords, PIN numbers and encryption keys management:LeVAULT will automatically manage all of your passwords, PIN numbers and encryption keys by remembering them so that you don’t have to. It will then change your passwords, PIN numbers and encryption keys as often as you like. You just simply select the account that you would like to log into and click “login”.This process makes the passwords, PIN numbers and encryption keys more complex, changed frequently and kept in a safe place by LeVAULT. Example of LeVAULT Auto Fill ProcessLeVAULT  Auto-Login Process to a Facebook account When you log into a website or application through LeVAULT, your username and password are filled in automatically. This makes the login process more secure, quicker and simpler for you. Access TimesIt's 2 a.m. Why is your secretary or another individual logging into your accounts or systems? We offer the option to set an individual’s “registered key” to only allow access into their LeVAULT account at certain times of the day (such as, but not limited to, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.). If this individual attempts to login outside of these times, the LAS (LeVAULT Authentication Server) will deny the individual access and flag and report the attempted login as inappropriate activity. Flagged ActivityLeVAULT's Red Flags display windowActivities flagged as “inappropriate” can be viewed by an individual or administrator  in a live report. This is intended to help you become aware of unauthorized attempts to access a LeVAULT account. If you have this knowledge, then you can take action to stop it before the hacker is successful.Some activities that are flagged include:
Attempted login with incorrect PIN number
Attempted login with incorrect password
Attempted login with an “unregistered key”
Attempted login outside of “access times”
An attempt to  register a device that has already been registered. 
 Example of Registered Key RemovalLeVAULT provides a “registered key” monitoring feature. This feature is comprised of three registered key removal options, listed below:LeVAULT  Shutdown, Hibernate & Lock OptionsWhen the “registered key” is removed or out of range of the user's designated zone, the user has the following options:
Shutdown
Hibernate
Lock
If the user has not chosen one of the above three options, LeVAULT will still detect the removal of the “registered key” and default to shut down your computer.Logout of LeVAULT & Logout of websites and applications optionsUpon the removal of the “registered key”, you can have LeVAULT logout of the applications and websites that are currently open, and to logout of the LeVAULT client once the computer enters shutdown, hibernate, or lock mode.LeVAULT grayed out after the ""registered key"" has been removedWhen the monitoring system detects the removal of a “registered key”, LeVAULT will completely disable all but it’s “Logout” button. Once your “registered key"" is reconnected or back in range, LeVAULT will re-enable itself automatically unless you have chosen the option to logout of the client (LeVAULT) upon removal of the key (see #2 above)._____________________________________________________________________________

my background is in Healthcare Administration and Management. I have always loved technology and after inheriting my Aunty's old iPad and browsing the App Store, I began to research into what it would take to get into App development.I did a business course , found a fantastic app development team called Locassa and now we have Kinship, it  is a social activity and safety for friends and family application that is currently
available only in the App store and was launched on the 9<sup>th</sup> of January
2014.</p>
<p><br/></p><p><b>The Story Behind the
Kinship App</b></p>
<p>I had gone through
a difficult time and had been out of touch with family and friends. I am quite good at keeping in touch with people and wondered why my failure to behave in my usual fashion had yielded no calls to check on my well being? When I began to call round everyone's reply was that they had thought of me often but had been so busy. It came to me that this was very unsatisfactory and worrisome. After what I had been through, I knew that we should not accept the excuse of being busy as a satisfactory
answer for losing touch with someone anymore. Not after receiving a call from someone that helped pick me up, set me
right and made all the difference. I think I am tough but the truth is I almost
cracked just before I got that call. Looking back to when I spoke to my friend, I marvel at how magically the darkness seemed to lift and I could feel a strength flowing back into me. </p>
<p>We all have loved
ones, the people who truly matter. When we are going through tough times and
even good times, it’s these people we need to stay in contact with. As mobile technology grows, going silent and inactive on social media can be a cry for help. We need to study each other well enough to recognize each others patterns and to watch out for each other.Some people can deal with stuff on their own, not everybody can, or should even.Talking to and keeping regular contact with our loved ones is one way to keep each
other, happy, build strong relationships and keep safe. When we have regular
contact as a basis for our relationships, people are encouraged to open up and
then problems shared become problems solved because you get help that is ready.</p>
<p>Kinship is the
only social awareness app which tracks your closest people and alerts you when
they go quiet. Checking the activity dial around each person’s profile picture to get a sense of their activity and checking in on those who need you most, when they need you is invaluable.  According to MIND (The UK
Charity for Mental Health issues) Depression, loneliness, and suicidal thinking all can
be helped by having good social contact. </p>
<p>Keeping someone in the know of
your movements and who you’re with is not only common sense but perfect sense. If
people get accustomed to loved ones always keeping someone in the loop about
what they are doing, where they are going and with whom, it just becomes an
easier, safer environment for everyone to thrive. </p>
<p> With Kinship you’ll always be part of someone’s circle and
they’ll be part of yours.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What We Need
&amp; What You Get</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I
     need to raise £10,000 and this will go towards making an android version
     of Kinship.</li>
<li>Kinship is free and having it on Android will allow
     many more to become involved. Becoming a part of this campaign by donating or helping raise awareness of the app means you help make it possible for others to build and maintain their
     relationships in a positive way. That feeling is better than any perk I
     could give you. I am honoured to place you in a unique
     group of Kinship supporters that will go into a Kinship Hall of Fame on
     my website. Nobody after this Campaign will be admitted to this group, members of which will continue receiving special considerations from my company Techsis Ltd. The best part is everybody who owns an Android version of Kinship will be know who
     they owe it to.</li>
<li>If
     I don’t reach my desired goal amount, I will put all I have raised towards
     paying for building the android version and continue looking for ways to to finish
     the product because I believe in it and know it will improve relationships globally..</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Impact</b></p>

<p></p></div>","My name is Nana Fatimah Ogunfemi and
my background is in Healthcare Administration and Management. I have always loved technology and after inheriting my Aunty's old iPad and browsing the App Store, I began to research into what it would take to get into App development.I did a business course , found a fantastic app development team called Locassa and now we have Kinship, it  is a social activity and safety for friends and family application that is currently
available only in the App store and was launched on the 9th of January
2014.
The Story Behind the
Kinship App
I had gone through
a difficult time and had been out of touch with family and friends. I am quite good at keeping in touch with people and wondered why my failure to behave in my usual fashion had yielded no calls to check on my well being? When I began to call round everyone's reply was that they had thought of me often but had been so busy. It came to me that this was very unsatisfactory and worrisome. After what I had been through, I knew that we should not accept the excuse of being busy as a satisfactory
answer for losing touch with someone anymore. Not after receiving a call from someone that helped pick me up, set me
right and made all the difference. I think I am tough but the truth is I almost
cracked just before I got that call. Looking back to when I spoke to my friend, I marvel at how magically the darkness seemed to lift and I could feel a strength flowing back into me. 
We all have loved
ones, the people who truly matter. When we are going through tough times and
even good times, it’s these people we need to stay in contact with. As mobile technology grows, going silent and inactive on social media can be a cry for help. We need to study each other well enough to recognize each others patterns and to watch out for each other.Some people can deal with stuff on their own, not everybody can, or should even.Talking to and keeping regular contact with our loved ones is one way to keep each
other, happy, build strong relationships and keep safe. When we have regular
contact as a basis for our relationships, people are encouraged to open up and
then problems shared become problems solved because you get help that is ready.
Kinship is the
only social awareness app which tracks your closest people and alerts you when
they go quiet. Checking the activity dial around each person’s profile picture to get a sense of their activity and checking in on those who need you most, when they need you is invaluable.  According to MIND (The UK
Charity for Mental Health issues) Depression, loneliness, and suicidal thinking all can
be helped by having good social contact. 
Keeping someone in the know of
your movements and who you’re with is not only common sense but perfect sense. If
people get accustomed to loved ones always keeping someone in the loop about
what they are doing, where they are going and with whom, it just becomes an
easier, safer environment for everyone to thrive. 
 With Kinship you’ll always be part of someone’s circle and
they’ll be part of yours.
What We Need
& What You Get

I
     need to raise £10,000 and this will go towards making an android version
     of Kinship.
Kinship is free and having it on Android will allow
     many more to become involved. Becoming a part of this campaign by donating or helping raise awareness of the app means you help make it possible for others to build and maintain their
     relationships in a positive way. That feeling is better than any perk I
     could give you. I am honoured to place you in a unique
     group of Kinship supporters that will go into a Kinship Hall of Fame on
     my website. Nobody after this Campaign will be admitted to this group, members of which will continue receiving special considerations from my company Techsis Ltd. The best part is everybody who owns an Android version of Kinship will be know who
     they owe it to.
If
     I don’t reach my desired goal amount, I will put all I have raised towards
     paying for building the android version and continue looking for ways to to finish
     the product because I believe in it and know it will improve relationships globally..

The Impact

The Kinship project is important because I know and everyone who has ever been in a similar situation knows a hand up when you are down is the
     best thing we can give or receive as people. I
     know how difficult getting back on your feet again can be first hand. I went
     through one of the lowest times of my life very lonely, no one should go
     through that. It took someone who remembered to call me and reignite something in me to get me back on the road to recovery. Someone who cared to give me that push start I needed. It is my conviction that through the Kinship app which works like a second conscience for us, we will be prompted to make that call, because we need each other's support to make it anywhere in this life.

<p>Yapper's main feature is the random section. It enables you to kickstart a conversation with a random person around the world.

<ul><li>From the main menu of Yapper you will find a 3D interactive globe. </li></ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>You can explore the globe and click on a part of the world more or less specific to launch a conversation with a random user that lives there. </li>
<li>You can see the amount of user activity in any country or city just by looking at the globe</li>
<li>You can click on the ""Preferences"" button to establish preferences such as age, gender, spoken languages, country of residence or interests so that the match between the two users is more effective </li>
<li>If you want to be more adventurous, you can just click on the Random Button to get in touch with a completely random person. You may be surprised!</li>
<li>Once the link between you and a person is established, you will access a typical conversation window where you can send yaps and files to that person</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Marshel Copple and I'm an atheist in a fight with the State of California because they said I cannot be considered for religious accommodation.  I know that atheism is not a religion for everyone, but I have built a religion from atheist concepts and the biology and psychology that people have evolved with.  To be really specific I believe I need a full night's sleep before I go to a job where I might decide whether or not to fatally shoot a person with a rifle.  You see, psychology research has revealed that a person may increase the time required to make the same decision from about 2 seconds to about 7.  In a scenario where you work at a prison gun tower and need to decide in a couple seconds if you need to shoot one person to prevent a potentially fatal attack on another person, you should not be in a mind state that's costing you five more seconds of decision making. What if you decide too late or if you don't take the extra 5 seconds and just make the wrong decision?  The state said that a religion with beliefs like that cannot be legally legitimate because it's too scientific.  They actually described my religion as ""codified science.""  They also don't mind me being sleep-deprived when I go take the rifle in a tower position at one of their prisons.</p>
<p>The good news is that there is no law limiting a religion's scientific adherence.  The bad news is that I am losing the legal battle anyway.  The California superior court judge has supported the deputy attorney general's arguments and ruled that I do not get a trial.  I really need some help to keep my head above water and make this trial happen.  I am currently preparing my appeal which will be viewed by three more judges who can choose to give me a shot at a trial.</p>
<p>I hope you can agree that trying to get a good night's sleep before getting ready to shoot people is a great religious value that is totally appropriate for an atheist religion.  If you'd like to know more about my religion check out Sun Worshipping Atheism at withsun.livejournal.com.  If you'd like to know more about me, ask me questions in the messages (because I don't want to put myself out there for retaliation.) </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am seeking money for direct court costs.  At this stage I am appealling for trial.  The cost of appeal is $775.  The cost of the clerk's transcript is $100.  The cost of the reporter's transcript is still unknown, but pricey. </p>
<p>Any odd remaining money will be used for related legal aid or redonated to atheist/humanist groups to positively represent atheists/humanists (but I'm pretty sure I'll need all the money).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Secular Humanism was recognized as a religion by the Supreme Court in 1961 (Torcaso v Watkins).  If the State of California wins on the arguments they are currently winning on, they successfully establish case law that this is no longer true and that a religion must be supernatural in order to be protected by the state.  Please, please, don't let this happen.</p>
<p>Civil rights in general took a big hit on this trial.  Rulings by the court in my summary hearing counter previous precedents and make it almost impossible for someone to sue for any type of civil action.  Look up equitable tolling and the definition of material adverse action, two things that were once very reasonable. The former is gone now and the latter has been revised to make employers immune if they harass an employee into quitting.</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you happen to be/know an employment/appellate civil lawyer and believe you could provide helpful consultation, that would be great! Let me know!</p>
<p>If you are good at publicity, that would rock too!</p>
<p>If you're not, maybe you could just send a supportive message. If I can show that they are stepping on the toes and ideals of more than one person it will help get past some of the callous dismissiveness.</p>

If you happen to be/know an employment/appellate civil lawyer and believe you could provide helpful consultation, that would be great! Let me know!
If you are good at publicity, that would rock too!
If you're not, maybe you could just send a supportive message. If I can show that they are stepping on the toes and ideals of more than one person it will help get past some of the callous dismissiveness.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>What is DriveMode?</b></p>
<p>The RayGo mobile app adds DriveMode on-the-fly to popular apps and utilities, making it simple and intuitive to use. DriveMode replaces complex graphics with easy-to-glance-at screens and voice prompts; and replaces touch-screen gestures with simple key presses on the 5-key controller.  This automatic conversion of graphics into linear and common vocal elements is the key factor that enables us to provide intuitive interface for the blind and for drivers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Which apps can I use with RayGo?</b></p>
<p>At delivery RayGo will work with Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Spotify, Gmail, SMS and telephone apps. We will be adding support for more apps in the updates to the RayGo mobile app following the campaign. The top apps on our list are Pandora, Spotify and Skype.</p>
<p>We'd love to hear your suggestions on which app we need to support in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What kinds of apps do not work with RayGo?</b></p>
<p>RayGo will not support apps that create a significant visual distraction, for example games, video apps (e.g. YouTube), and picture apps (e.g. Camera, Instagram, Snapchat.)</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What are the voice control functions RayGo provides?</b></p>
<p>You can control your apps using just 5 keys of the RayGo controller. That includes responding to your messages with pre-defined quick responses (don't forget your main task is driving!) If you cannot delay sending a longer message, you can send a recorded audio message or use voice recognition. When sending recorded audio message, the recipient will hear your voice as recorded by the smartphone. When using voice recognition, your smartphone will translate your voice into a text string before sending the message to the recipient. </p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>I already have an app that stops me from texting. Why is RayGo better?</b></p>RayGo is not a product for those who already found the way to avoid using their smartphones while driving. This is certainly the best and safest way to keep your full attention to the road.    RayGo is a product for the many of us who use their phones even though we know it’s wrong, providing a much safer way to engage with your smartphone while driving.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p><b>I like to glance at my phone when I am using a navigation app. Will I be able to see the map in DriveMode?</b></p>
<p>When you need to look at your phone, and a navigation app is a good example for it, you can proactively activate the screen by pressing the hot key (long press on the center button) on the RayGo steering-wheel controller. The screen is left open for 2 seconds which is the recommended time limit for visual distractions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>When can I expect my pre-ordered RayGo?</b></span></p>
<p>Once our campaign is successfully funded, you can expect your RayGo within 4 months of the campaign’s completion</p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<p><b>Which smartphones does RayGo work with?</b></p>
<p>Any Android device running OS version 4.1 and above</p>
<p><b><b>Does RayGo work with iPhone?</b></b></p>
<p>Currently, we offer limited support to iPhone users that include reading aloud notifications. We are working on better adapting RayGo for the iPhone, and the full version should be available in the next six months.</p>
<p><b><b>How does the controller connect to my phone?</b></b><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The controller connects to your smartphone over a standard Bluetooth connection.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>How does RayGo know when how I am speeding up or slowing down?</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The RayGo mobile app receives updates on the device’s speed from sensors on the RayGo controller and the smartphone. so we can evaluate whether it is safe to interrupt a user with a notification.</span></p>
<p><b><b>Does RayGo come in different colors?</b></b></p>
<p>We evaluated different color schemes aiming to design a device that can blend in car interiors while still being fresh and modern. Dark grey with lime yellow worked best in our tests. We are open to considering additional color schemes suggested by you in the comments.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>I have more questions. Who can I ask?</b></span><br/></p>

""Texting and driving. We know it's a stupid idea, yet despite all those campaigns against it, some people still think they can handle the demands of a vehicle and their text messages at the same time. And if they're going to continue to do it, there might as well be a product that makes it safer.""

With this 5 key Bluetooth controller mounted right on your steering wheel, you’ve got your phone at your fingertips. When you begin driving, the RayGo mobile app senses and automatically converts your favorite apps to DriveMode





DriveMode simplifies your pre-existing apps, such as Whatsapp, Facebook, Skype, WeChat, Gmail, Telephony, SMS Messages, Pandora and Spotify - letting you use your apps, while driving, without ever looking at your phone.

RayGo works on Android only with the following apps:



















RayGo DriveMode works in the same simple way that the RAY smartphone for the blind works, letting you control your apps with just 5 keys.


DriveMode is so intuitive and smart that it knows when the driver is busy. It holds back notifications, pauses message playbacks, and even speaks slower when necessary, protecting you from the urge to multi-task, and focusing your attention on the road. 
RayGo can be used by right- and left-handed people - The controller can be installed on either left or right sides of the steering wheel and will update the key mappings according to its orientation.







Project RAY is the leading provider of smartphone technology for the blind and visually impaired. Now we bring our sightless patented technology to drivers everywhere, ensuring that RayGo is 100% eyes-free!

RayGo is not only the safest smartphone solution for drivers, you can also attach RayGo to your bike handles, or even toss your phone into your bag. It will work in the same way, letting you use your apps, while riding your bike, without having to look at your phone.

What is DriveMode?
The RayGo mobile app adds DriveMode on-the-fly to popular apps and utilities, making it simple and intuitive to use. DriveMode replaces complex graphics with easy-to-glance-at screens and voice prompts; and replaces touch-screen gestures with simple key presses on the 5-key controller.  This automatic conversion of graphics into linear and common vocal elements is the key factor that enables us to provide intuitive interface for the blind and for drivers.

Which apps can I use with RayGo?
At delivery RayGo will work with Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Spotify, Gmail, SMS and telephone apps. We will be adding support for more apps in the updates to the RayGo mobile app following the campaign. The top apps on our list are Pandora, Spotify and Skype.
We'd love to hear your suggestions on which app we need to support in the future.

What kinds of apps do not work with RayGo?
RayGo will not support apps that create a significant visual distraction, for example games, video apps (e.g. YouTube), and picture apps (e.g. Camera, Instagram, Snapchat.)

What are the voice control functions RayGo provides?
You can control your apps using just 5 keys of the RayGo controller. That includes responding to your messages with pre-defined quick responses (don't forget your main task is driving!) If you cannot delay sending a longer message, you can send a recorded audio message or use voice recognition. When sending recorded audio message, the recipient will hear your voice as recorded by the smartphone. When using voice recognition, your smartphone will translate your voice into a text string before sending the message to the recipient. 

I already have an app that stops me from texting. Why is RayGo better?RayGo is not a product for those who already found the way to avoid using their smartphones while driving. This is certainly the best and safest way to keep your full attention to the road.    RayGo is a product for the many of us who use their phones even though we know it’s wrong, providing a much safer way to engage with your smartphone while driving.


I like to glance at my phone when I am using a navigation app. Will I be able to see the map in DriveMode?
When you need to look at your phone, and a navigation app is a good example for it, you can proactively activate the screen by pressing the hot key (long press on the center button) on the RayGo steering-wheel controller. The screen is left open for 2 seconds which is the recommended time limit for visual distractions.

When can I expect my pre-ordered RayGo?
Once our campaign is successfully funded, you can expect your RayGo within 4 months of the campaign’s completion

Which smartphones does RayGo work with?
Any Android device running OS version 4.1 and above
Does RayGo work with iPhone?
Currently, we offer limited support to iPhone users that include reading aloud notifications. We are working on better adapting RayGo for the iPhone, and the full version should be available in the next six months.
How does the controller connect to my phone?
The controller connects to your smartphone over a standard Bluetooth connection.
How does RayGo know when how I am speeding up or slowing down?
The RayGo mobile app receives updates on the device’s speed from sensors on the RayGo controller and the smartphone. so we can evaluate whether it is safe to interrupt a user with a notification.
Does RayGo come in different colors?
We evaluated different color schemes aiming to design a device that can blend in car interiors while still being fresh and modern. Dark grey with lime yellow worked best in our tests. We are open to considering additional color schemes suggested by you in the comments.
I have more questions. Who can I ask?

The security of these algorithms has been tested over many years of use in hundreds of different applications. Messages sent via text are end-to-end encrypted, which means that they can only be read by your intended recipients. We make it easy for you to verify that you are communicating with the right people and that no MITM attack has occurred. The keys that are used to encrypt your messages are stored on your device alone, and they are protected by an additional layer of encryption if you have a passphrase enabled. No one has access to the contents of any messages sent by users. The Axolotl ratchet is the most advanced cryptographic ratchet available. Axolotl ensures that new AES keys are used for every single message, and it provides text messaging with both forward secrecy and future secrecy properties. The messaging protocol also features enhanced deniability properties that improve on those provided by OTR, except unlike OTR all of these features work well in an asynchronous mobile environment.  </p><h1>""AnonCom strives to deliver the current state of the art in secure mobile communications.""  </h1><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Making secure calls </b>When making a call you're first authenticated by one the authentication servers and then a relay server handles connecting you to the call recipient.

It fears that educated and empowered few who are willing to say enough and act. It fears the open minded. It fears you. Put some time to take action and be part of something important. The restoration of our freedom.  Privacy: noun pri·va·cy\ˈprī-və-sē  Freedom from damaging publicity, public scrutiny, secret surveillance, or unauthorized disclosure of one's personal data or informaiton, as by a government, corporation, or individual.We have entered an age of endangered privacy, where surveillance of our actions and exchanges as citizens is absolute.

With the AnonCom 4G to make high performance privacy and security affordable for everyone, or with the AnonCom X6, you are ready for the toughest challenges. ""Ordinary citizens, working together, can change the world"" ~Edward SnowdenEven a password protected cell phone is easily accessed by anyone who wants the information within. Remembering that even deleted files and photos are still lurking on your phone, how will you feel when those files became public? Nine of 10 account holders found in a large cache of intercepted conversations which former NSA contractor Edward Snowden provided, were not the intended surveillance targets but were caught in the net the agency had cast. There are more than 1.2 million people on various stages of the NSA watch list. Private Anonymous Communications  AnonCom uses Curve25519, AES-256, and HMAC-SHA256. The security of these algorithms has been tested over many years of use in hundreds of different applications. Messages sent via text are end-to-end encrypted, which means that they can only be read by your intended recipients. We make it easy for you to verify that you are communicating with the right people and that no MITM attack has occurred. The keys that are used to encrypt your messages are stored on your device alone, and they are protected by an additional layer of encryption if you have a passphrase enabled. No one has access to the contents of any messages sent by users. The Axolotl ratchet is the most advanced cryptographic ratchet available. Axolotl ensures that new AES keys are used for every single message, and it provides text messaging with both forward secrecy and future secrecy properties. The messaging protocol also features enhanced deniability properties that improve on those provided by OTR, except unlike OTR all of these features work well in an asynchronous mobile environment.  ""AnonCom strives to deliver the current state of the art in secure mobile communications.""  Making secure calls When making a call you're first authenticated by one the authentication servers and then a relay server handles connecting you to the call recipient. All of these communications are encrypted. Since the caller isn't directly connected to the recipient (most you need NAT traversal on mobile data networks), your provider isn't able to know who you're talking to. They could estimate out how long was the conversation, but they're not able to know the recipient or the content.  Private Internet Browsing The anonymous private browser assigns users an anonymous IP address that makes them virtually untraceable to chat with other anonymous users and surf the web. It prevents websites from tracking or logging your activities. It is the most secure browser for Android by automatically clearing cookies, histories, encrypting all in/out data, and assigning you a new IP address that cannot be tracked back to your phone or carrier.* Blocks sites affected by HeartBleed OpenSSL bug (performs ssl check) * Disabled Location Services for higher security (websites cannot snoop your location) * Full screen immersive mode * No ROOT or Plugins required * YouTube video support * Tabbed browsing * Desktop and Mobile Rendering * Flash Support (install flash.apk separately from Adobe) - but not recommended. * Encrypted ProxyPrivate encrypted emailFree and secure email service that works like any other standard email service (gmail,yahoo mail,etc.etc.), with the addition of a state of the art encryption and electronic signature to your messages and attachments. It is extremely user friendly, the 4096 bit RSA encryption keys and the signature are automatically generated. Performance of the futureAnonCom X6 has a super mighty 1.5 GHz quad core processor which provides the highest speed and smoothness while running any kinds of tasks. In addition, the phone has 2 GB of system memory and 32 GB of built in storage. The smartphone runs on a latest Android 4.2 operating system. These features are even more than what is needed for spaceships to be launched.The AnonCom 4G LTE has an amazing 1.7Ghz Octa Core processor, 2GB of system memory with 16 GB of built in storage running the Android 4.4 operating system.   Two super camerasWith the AnonCom X6 we left behind the principles of primary and secondary cameras. From now on, both rear and front cameras are 13 megapixels. As a result, the pictures have 3264x2448 pixels resolution and the videos can be shot with full HD resolution. With all that, the smartphone can be used as a real photo or video camera. With the SpyKit installed, motion detection surveillance, time lapse photography, and can even be triggered by SMS messaging.  The AnonCom 4G has the 13 megapixel main rear camera, but the secondary front camera is only 8 megapixel. Phenomenal displayAt 5"" diagonally, IPS matrix with 16 millions of colors display with Full HD 1080 x 1920 pixels, 24 bit resolution that is the highest resolution among all the rugged smartphones.

<a name=""does"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>What it does</h1><p>We help you to hide your true location, to 
anonymize your online activity, and to thwart others on your network (or
 your ISP or government agencies) from knowing what you are doing 
online.  This is especially useful for activists, newspaper reporters, 
NGOs, corporate executives, families, and any individual concerned with 
privacy.</p><p>We operate on the principle that, not only must Gordian 
be totally secure and reliable, but that it ought to do what people 
need! You can pop Gordian in your bag at the coffee shop and instantly 
(and wirelessly) connect to a hotspot from your phone, tablet, or 
laptop. Gordian will run for hours on an inexpensive USB power pack.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>KEY FEATURES (what sets us apart):</b></p><p></p><ul><li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Captive portal &amp; hotspot friendly</b><b> </b><br/>Gordian allows users to accept public hotspot terms and/or authenticate with captive portals, which is not possible with other privacy solutions. </li></ul><ul><li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Connect to wired and wireless Internet connections</b><br/>Gordian supports hotspots, cafes, airports, hotels, offices, home routers,  or any Internet source</li></ul><ul><li>
<b>All your devices can connect wirelessly or via wired networking</b><br/>Gordian creates a secure wireless network which supports computers, mobile devices. Network appliances can also connect via the wired connection.</li></ul><ul>
<li>
<b>Intuitive &amp; responsive computer and mobile-friendly user experience</b> <br/>Gordian's interface is easy to use in any browser and on any OS (iPhone and Android-friendly).<br/><br/>

<p></p><p><b>The secret sauce:</b></p><p>Gordian is a secure gateway for all communications emanating from a user's personal electronic device. Whether destined for the Internet or a corporate intranet these communications are immediately encrypted and tunneled over the anonymizing network called <a href=""http://bydesignsecurity.com/#tor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tor</a> where they pass through many other Tor users' devices before eventually travelling over the Internet to those communications' destinations.</p><p><b>Because of how Tor encrypts communications and disguises communications' sources and destinations, neither others on the same public network nor ISPs nor other users of Tor (not even governments) can view what you are doing on the Internet. Even the websites and services you access while using Gordian cannot locate or identify you (unless you provide your location or identifying information to them). Used in conjunction with clearing your web browser's cookies frequently, this greatly increases privacy, protecting the integrity of communications with correspondents and protecting against stalking, to name just a few of the benefits.</b></p><p>Using a hardware privacy and anonymity solution like ours is more effective than running Tor on your own computer or device, because it ensures all applications' network/Internet communications are routed through the Tor network, which helps protect against known side channel weaknesses common with using Tor and provides plug-and-play privacy and anonymity for the masses regardless of technological ability.</p><p></p><b><div>

<p><b><a name=""technical"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Technical details:</b></p>
<p>Our
 firmware unlocks a massively important feature set, and we are working 
with partners to pair it with the best hardware components in the long 
term. In the future, we’d like to build custom hardware… but we’re in 
the firmware business, and the best way for us to get that to the world 
is to ship it on preexisting hardware which we have thoroughly tested 
and that we trust. This gives users (from the least tech-savvy to 
seasoned hackers) automatic use of the Tor anonymity network on a very 
secure device. Our firmware utilizes some great tried and true open 
source software components, including OpenWRT, Tor, etc.. We built the 
entire user interface from the ground up to provide a simplified 
workflow designed to be used by people of most <i>any</i> technological ability (currently available in English exclusively).</p>
<p>Our prototypes are already leaps and bounds ahead of competition in functionality and efficiency. Our team is working diligently to perfect and test the newest and most revolutionary feature of Gordian: <b>FULL WIRELESS OPERATION</b>! <br/></p>

<h1>
<a name=""history"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Oh no, another Tor-enabled router! (Our History)</h1>
<p>We started our project years ago (<i>circa 2011</i>)
 and slowly and steadily made progress toward a foolproof usable privacy
 solution. Initial prototypes were large, clunky, ugly, and consumed 
power like a hungry baboon loves chocolate cake. What we needed were 
smaller, cheaper, more capable, and more power efficient hardware so we 
could continue with what we do best---hacking, packaging, and improving 
user experience. What we needed was what the future 
provided---inexpensive travel routers, SoCs, and infinite possibilities!
 That future is now.</p>
<p>In addition to our years of testing out new 
and newer devices as potential hardware vehicles for a practical, 
usable, portable, plug-and-play Tor-enabled gateway, we also watched as 
many Tor-enabled router projects came and went, most for wired-only 
connectivity, and all with the same critical flaws---their inability to 
handle the three really important scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Acting as a wireless client</b> to connect to wireless networks for Internet access (needed in many cafes, restaurants, hotels, and airports)</li>
<li>Support for <b>captive portals </b>and<b> hotspots</b>
</li>
<li>Support <b>mobile phones</b>, <b>tablets</b>, and <b>devices without Ethernet ports </b>by simultaneously acting as a <b>secured wireless access point </b>and a <b>wireless client</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What sets our project apart from our older cousins? Gordian does all that right out of the box! And with a super-simple interface that 
doesn't require users to write a single line of code.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, and.. <b>we've just spent the last 11 months testing it out everywhere </b>from fast food restaurants to coffeehouses to college campuses. </p>
<p><i>We'll never look at french fries the same ever again...</i></p>

<a name=""about"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>What do we know, anyway? (About Us)</h1>
<p>We
 are a team from a variety of research, development, and business 
backgrounds, living and loving life in a highly-innovative college town 
near four universities.</p>
<p>Our team consists of 11 individuals (and 
rapidly growing!) who not only believe in this product, but who also 
have years of experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>researching the <b>usable security and privacy</b> problems</li>
<li>researching and modeling <b>networks and network security</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>writing software and firmware</b> that run on devices (embedded Linux and microcontrollers alike)</li>
<li>running successful <b>businesses </b>and<b> NGOs</b>
</li>
<li>managing <b>financial</b> assets exceeding $1.5 million USD</li>
<li>developing <b>marketing </b>strategies for Fortune 500 firms</li>
<li>producing award-winning <b>photography and videography</b> projects</li>
<li>customer service <b>management</b> and order fulfillment</li>
</ul>
<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>
<a name=""goals"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>How will backers' money be used? (Our Goals)</h1>
<p>After we
 allocate finances to fulfill the rewards we've listed for various 
support amounts (it's our first obligation!) a good portion of the funds
 you donate will go toward hardware/merchandise and shipping costs. 
Then, tentatively but subject to change, remaining funds will be applied
 to the development costs associated with the following goals. So before
 moving forward with design and innovation, we will fulfill the rewards 
we've listed for each level of giving. </p>
<p>It is important to note 
that each Gordian device we deliver through this Indiegogo campaign 
will be a fully functional beta-device. We will have put the hardware 
and firmware through rigorous testing. Building on the foundation laid 
by our Indiegogo supporters, we will continue to innovate our firmware 
and work toward developing a custom enclosure with additional 
functionality (think a slimmer profile). We're in this for the long 
haul, and we firmly believe Gordian should be thoughtfully designed as 
well as practically useful.</p>
<p><b>BRIEFLY: We did the math, and every
 1000 devices we produce could require upwards of 250 person-hours 
(man-hours) for assembly/QA/handling, plus shipping costs.  It's also 
quite difficult to staff full-time employees on a temporary basis. These
 factors could contribute the greatest to costs associated with 
fulfilling our rewards, and we've set our various reward price points to
 maximize our ability to follow through.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Goals:</b></figure>
<ul>
<li>Strengthen core feature set mentioned above</li>
<li>Improve user experience even more (we have a lot of ideas to implement in the interface.)</li>
<li>Further testing in many different environments (even internationally)</li>
<li>Foster a community of users to support one another; Anything related to Tor involves community, and we love that.</li>
<li>Develop ability to auto-update firmware (in a secure manner)</li>
<li>Communicate with the utmost transparency and honesty</li>
<li>Build a comprehensive brand and a strong web-presence (website)</li>
<li>Develop marketing strategies (positioning and market research)</li>
<li>Setup shipping structure for worldwide delivery</li>
<li>Create a marketplace for promoting innovative usable security and 
privacy services to help people locate them and become educated about 
their usefulness</li>
</ul>
<p>If our funding goal is exceeded, we will look into applying a 
portion of the funds toward developing (which could include hiring) 
several of our long-term stretch goals, including but not limited to the
 following list. Of course, stretch goals are not guaranteed within this
 campaign, but are intended to give potential backers a brain-dump---a 
glimpse of our broader vision and desires related to our project's 
focus, things that we think would be cool to see.</p>
<p><b>Stretch Goals:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Building much-needed secure/private/anonymous services that are easy to use (and inherently safe to access through our firmware)</li>
<li>Promoting secure-by-design and private-by-design software through 
improving usability, user experience, support, and education---getting 
today's best protection into the hands of everyone</li>
<li>Researching and developing secure/private/anonymous Cloud services, 
as well as completely decentralized peer-to-peer products that 
auto-scale, can never be monitored, and can never be shut down</li>
<li>Developing firmware/feature enhancements based upon user feedback</li>
<li>Possibly building meaningful partnerships with like-minded projects and developers</li>
<li>Possibly exploring additional future hardware options, depending upon funds, potential ROI, and user feedback</li>
<li>Networking efforts with individuals, organizations, NGOs, 
non-profits, journalists, and even foreign governments who are concerned
 about their privacy to help us cater solutions to their needs</li>
<li>Support for RADIUS or WPA Enterprise </li>
</ul>

<h1>The bottom line</h1>
<p><b>Goal of this project: </b>We'd
 love your support in enabling us to do what we do best: creatively pair
 components, refine user experience, and get a safer-to-use Tor solution
 into the hands of everyday human beings in the form of a super-portable
 router preconfigured to run Tor which can (with our innovative firmware
 solutions) support captive portals and hotspots. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is something that no one has ever accomplished before!</p>
<p><b>Vision of our company:</b>
 We believe our approach is uniquely positioned to be a game changer in 
how everyone from road warrior designers to Fortune 500 executives 
enjoys affordable and reliable Internet security. If in the long run all
 we do is increase awareness of Tor and create momentum in usable 
security and privacy demand and development (even for projects or 
businesses other than our own) we'll be able to sleep at night; however,
 with your support, we might possibly be able to position our company as
 an industry influencer with many other usable security and privacy 
projects to come!</p>

<a name=""risks"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Risks &amp; Challenges</h1>
<p>We have been working with a hardware manufacturer for our 
developmental prototype Gordian already, and this manufacturer has promised to be able to provide enough units for us to fulfill our rewards to our Indiegogo supporters within a reasonable time frame. (We are interested in finding a backup manufacturer too, just in case.)<br/></p>
<p>Because simultaneous wireless network and wireless device connections,

What it doesWe help you to hide your true location, to 
anonymize your online activity, and to thwart others on your network (or
 your ISP or government agencies) from knowing what you are doing 
online.  This is especially useful for activists, newspaper reporters, 
NGOs, corporate executives, families, and any individual concerned with 
privacy.We operate on the principle that, not only must Gordian 
be totally secure and reliable, but that it ought to do what people 
need! You can pop Gordian in your bag at the coffee shop and instantly 
(and wirelessly) connect to a hotspot from your phone, tablet, or 
laptop. Gordian will run for hours on an inexpensive USB power pack.KEY FEATURES (what sets us apart):
Captive portal & hotspot friendly Gordian allows users to accept public hotspot terms and/or authenticate with captive portals, which is not possible with other privacy solutions. 
Connect to wired and wireless Internet connectionsGordian supports hotspots, cafes, airports, hotels, offices, home routers,  or any Internet source
All your devices can connect wirelessly or via wired networkingGordian creates a secure wireless network which supports computers, mobile devices. Network appliances can also connect via the wired connection.

Intuitive & responsive computer and mobile-friendly user experience Gordian's interface is easy to use in any browser and on any OS (iPhone and Android-friendly).


Fails safe & secure while surfing anonymously All application traffic is funneled through an anonymous proxy, even from applications that do not support proxies; if the anonymous proxy fails for some reason, you can be assured that no traffic will pass through.


How it works
The secret sauce:Gordian is a secure gateway for all communications emanating from a user's personal electronic device. Whether destined for the Internet or a corporate intranet these communications are immediately encrypted and tunneled over the anonymizing network called Tor where they pass through many other Tor users' devices before eventually travelling over the Internet to those communications' destinations.Because of how Tor encrypts communications and disguises communications' sources and destinations, neither others on the same public network nor ISPs nor other users of Tor (not even governments) can view what you are doing on the Internet. Even the websites and services you access while using Gordian cannot locate or identify you (unless you provide your location or identifying information to them). Used in conjunction with clearing your web browser's cookies frequently, this greatly increases privacy, protecting the integrity of communications with correspondents and protecting against stalking, to name just a few of the benefits.Using a hardware privacy and anonymity solution like ours is more effective than running Tor on your own computer or device, because it ensures all applications' network/Internet communications are routed through the Tor network, which helps protect against known side channel weaknesses common with using Tor and provides plug-and-play privacy and anonymity for the masses regardless of technological ability.
Connection options:

WIRELESS DEVICE & WIRELESS INTERNET*: Connect smart 
phones, tablets, laptops, or desktops wirelessly to Gordian, and then 
join an available secured or open wireless network in the vicinity.
WIRED DEVICE & WIRELESS INTERNET**: Connect desktops, 
laptops, tablets via wire to Gordian, and then join either an open or 
secured wireless network in the vicinity.WIRELESS DEVICE & WIRED INTERNET*: Connect your home 
router or internet connection via wire to Gordian and then wirelessly 
connect any mobile device or laptop to Gordian on your own secure 
network.WIRED DEVICE & WIRED INTERNET*: Connect your home 
router or internet connection via wire to Gordian and then wirelessly 
connect any mobile device or laptop to Guardian on your own secure 
network.* This was recently implemented, and we will be performing more testing in the coming months (with your help, of course!)
** This is already an implemented and well-tested feature of Gordian.                            

Technical details:
Our
 firmware unlocks a massively important feature set, and we are working 
with partners to pair it with the best hardware components in the long 
term. In the future, we’d like to build custom hardware… but we’re in 
the firmware business, and the best way for us to get that to the world 
is to ship it on preexisting hardware which we have thoroughly tested 
and that we trust. This gives users (from the least tech-savvy to 
seasoned hackers) automatic use of the Tor anonymity network on a very 
secure device. Our firmware utilizes some great tried and true open 
source software components, including OpenWRT, Tor, etc.. We built the 
entire user interface from the ground up to provide a simplified 
workflow designed to be used by people of most any technological ability (currently available in English exclusively).
Our prototypes are already leaps and bounds ahead of competition in functionality and efficiency. Our team is working diligently to perfect and test the newest and most revolutionary feature of Gordian: FULL WIRELESS OPERATION! 


Oh no, another Tor-enabled router! (Our History)
We started our project years ago (circa 2011)
 and slowly and steadily made progress toward a foolproof usable privacy
 solution. Initial prototypes were large, clunky, ugly, and consumed 
power like a hungry baboon loves chocolate cake. What we needed were 
smaller, cheaper, more capable, and more power efficient hardware so we 
could continue with what we do best---hacking, packaging, and improving 
user experience. What we needed was what the future 
provided---inexpensive travel routers, SoCs, and infinite possibilities!
 That future is now.
In addition to our years of testing out new 
and newer devices as potential hardware vehicles for a practical, 
usable, portable, plug-and-play Tor-enabled gateway, we also watched as 
many Tor-enabled router projects came and went, most for wired-only 
connectivity, and all with the same critical flaws---their inability to 
handle the three really important scenarios:


Acting as a wireless client to connect to wireless networks for Internet access (needed in many cafes, restaurants, hotels, and airports)
Support for captive portals and hotspots

Support mobile phones, tablets, and devices without Ethernet ports by simultaneously acting as a secured wireless access point and a wireless client


What sets our project apart from our older cousins? Gordian does all that right out of the box! And with a super-simple interface that 
doesn't require users to write a single line of code.
Oh, yeah, and.. we've just spent the last 11 months testing it out everywhere from fast food restaurants to coffeehouses to college campuses. 
We'll never look at french fries the same ever again...


What do we know, anyway? (About Us)
We
 are a team from a variety of research, development, and business 
backgrounds, living and loving life in a highly-innovative college town 
near four universities.
Our team consists of 11 individuals (and 
rapidly growing!) who not only believe in this product, but who also 
have years of experience:

researching the usable security and privacy problems
researching and modeling networks and network security


writing software and firmware that run on devices (embedded Linux and microcontrollers alike)
running successful businesses and NGOs

managing financial assets exceeding $1.5 million USD
developing marketing strategies for Fortune 500 firms
producing award-winning photography and videography projects
customer service management and order fulfillment



How will backers' money be used? (Our Goals)
After we
 allocate finances to fulfill the rewards we've listed for various 
support amounts (it's our first obligation!) a good portion of the funds
 you donate will go toward hardware/merchandise and shipping costs. 
Then, tentatively but subject to change, remaining funds will be applied
 to the development costs associated with the following goals. So before
 moving forward with design and innovation, we will fulfill the rewards 
we've listed for each level of giving. 
It is important to note 
that each Gordian device we deliver through this Indiegogo campaign 
will be a fully functional beta-device. We will have put the hardware 
and firmware through rigorous testing. Building on the foundation laid 
by our Indiegogo supporters, we will continue to innovate our firmware 
and work toward developing a custom enclosure with additional 
functionality (think a slimmer profile). We're in this for the long 
haul, and we firmly believe Gordian should be thoughtfully designed as 
well as practically useful.
BRIEFLY: We did the math, and every
 1000 devices we produce could require upwards of 250 person-hours 
(man-hours) for assembly/QA/handling, plus shipping costs.  It's also 
quite difficult to staff full-time employees on a temporary basis. These
 factors could contribute the greatest to costs associated with 
fulfilling our rewards, and we've set our various reward price points to
 maximize our ability to follow through.


Goals:

Strengthen core feature set mentioned above
Improve user experience even more (we have a lot of ideas to implement in the interface.)
Further testing in many different environments (even internationally)
Foster a community of users to support one another; Anything related to Tor involves community, and we love that.
Develop ability to auto-update firmware (in a secure manner)
Communicate with the utmost transparency and honesty
Build a comprehensive brand and a strong web-presence (website)
Develop marketing strategies (positioning and market research)
Setup shipping structure for worldwide delivery
Create a marketplace for promoting innovative usable security and 
privacy services to help people locate them and become educated about 
their usefulness

If our funding goal is exceeded, we will look into applying a 
portion of the funds toward developing (which could include hiring) 
several of our long-term stretch goals, including but not limited to the
 following list. Of course, stretch goals are not guaranteed within this
 campaign, but are intended to give potential backers a brain-dump---a 
glimpse of our broader vision and desires related to our project's 
focus, things that we think would be cool to see.
Stretch Goals:

Building much-needed secure/private/anonymous services that are easy to use (and inherently safe to access through our firmware)
Promoting secure-by-design and private-by-design software through 
improving usability, user experience, support, and education---getting 
today's best protection into the hands of everyone
Researching and developing secure/private/anonymous Cloud services, 
as well as completely decentralized peer-to-peer products that 
auto-scale, can never be monitored, and can never be shut down
Developing firmware/feature enhancements based upon user feedback
Possibly building meaningful partnerships with like-minded projects and developers
Possibly exploring additional future hardware options, depending upon funds, potential ROI, and user feedback
Networking efforts with individuals, organizations, NGOs, 
non-profits, journalists, and even foreign governments who are concerned
 about their privacy to help us cater solutions to their needs
Support for RADIUS or WPA Enterprise 












The bottom line
Goal of this project: We'd
 love your support in enabling us to do what we do best: creatively pair
 components, refine user experience, and get a safer-to-use Tor solution
 into the hands of everyday human beings in the form of a super-portable
 router preconfigured to run Tor which can (with our innovative firmware
 solutions) support captive portals and hotspots. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is something that no one has ever accomplished before!
Vision of our company:
 We believe our approach is uniquely positioned to be a game changer in 
how everyone from road warrior designers to Fortune 500 executives 
enjoys affordable and reliable Internet security. If in the long run all
 we do is increase awareness of Tor and create momentum in usable 
security and privacy demand and development (even for projects or 
businesses other than our own) we'll be able to sleep at night; however,
 with your support, we might possibly be able to position our company as
 an industry influencer with many other usable security and privacy 
projects to come!




Risks & Challenges
We have been working with a hardware manufacturer for our 
developmental prototype Gordian already, and this manufacturer has promised to be able to provide enough units for us to fulfill our rewards to our Indiegogo supporters within a reasonable time frame. (We are interested in finding a backup manufacturer too, just in case.)
Because simultaneous wireless network and wireless device connections,
 as well as simultaneous wired network and wired device connections, are 
both new features we have just implemented, we will need to perform 
further testing prior to shipment and they are the most likely culprits for potential bugs. We have noticed in tests that, upon initially connecting to a wireless network when using the simultaneous wireless network and wireless device connectivity (fully-wireless operation), some personal devices seem to briefly disconnect and reconnect to the wireless access point provided by Gordian---this does not seem to prevent the Gordian from being usable, but we hope to find ways to improve this experience while performing further testing. Those who pledge support and receive one or more Gordian units should consider the devices they receive to be an initial public beta version of the Gordian router.  As with any beta device, there is the potential for limitations that will be improved upon in future versions of the device based upon user feedback.Wireless network connections 
(including WPA/WPA2 Personal, but not including RADIUS or WPA Enterprise
 yet) with wired personal device connections are well-tested and 
working quite well, in our opinion.Our Gordian router makes use of the third-party Tor anonymity network; as such, it is subject to the performance overhead and other constraints associated with the use of Tor.

<p>We are a Team of connector developers, who have be working in the Information Transport System (ITS) industry for more than 10 years.  Over the years that we worked on ITS cabling products, we find that new solutions could be proposed to simply the way cabling has been done.  </p>
<p>We live in a world of inter-connected networks.  Almost every home has some network cabling.  It is quite often that you would need new cabling or change existing cabling from time to time.  Usually you would need to call your cable installer to do the professional job.  You could also get yourself some training, and buy some tools to do the job by yourself.  We have a solution which would make this job easier.</p>

<p></p><p></p></div>","ABOUT
We are a Team of connector developers, who have be working in the Information Transport System (ITS) industry for more than 10 years.  Over the years that we worked on ITS cabling products, we find that new solutions could be proposed to simply the way cabling has been done.  
We live in a world of inter-connected networks.  Almost every home has some network cabling.  It is quite often that you would need new cabling or change existing cabling from time to time.  Usually you would need to call your cable installer to do the professional job.  You could also get yourself some training, and buy some tools to do the job by yourself.  We have a solution which would make this job easier.






Our new connector Direct Attach Bending RJ45 (DAB-RJ) can be installed easily WITHOUT professional training and specialized crimp tool, as would be needed with legacy RJ45 plugs.



EASY AND LOW FAILURE CONNECTIONThe DAB-RJ is designed so that it can be easily installed correctly.  The DAB-RJ is designed with our patent pending Flexible PCB technology so that common problems of the network connector can be avoided.Problem 1 - often occurs during the transportation and handling of the connector, could ultimately lead to improper crimpingProblem 2 - damaged crimp tool, could ultimately lead to improper crimpingExample of mis-contact due to improper crimpingProblem 3 - cable compatibility
associated with plug types are sometime s confusing.  If a solid cable is connected to a plug
designed for stranded cable, there will be connection problems.
THE DIRECT ATTACH
The concept of direct attached connection is also a new concept to simplify unnecessary connection points in the cabling system.THE BENDINGThe Bendable design of DAB-RJ allows bending of the connector body without compromising the transmission performance.  This allows the plug to be used in space limited environment, and also relief bending stress on the network cable.

The right soundtrack makes working out 10x more motivating and most importantly, it helps keep you going longer. Along with good tunes, a heart rate monitor is vital for those who are serious about training. Tracking the major fitness metrics such as heart rate, oxygen uptake and respiration, improve your exercise efficiency and help you train with purpose.
Now V-Powerbuds Pro combines both great sound and valuable workout analytics. It tracks your fitness data - heart rate, oxygen uptake and respiration rate through an innovative biologically-designed set of earbuds. Thanks to its Bio-signal tracking, V-Powerbuds Pro will help you meet your exercise goals and improve your training performance. At the same time, you can enjoy your favorite music and talk on the phone without the need to touch a single button. 
   Enjoy an active lifestyle with secure-fitting earbuds, thanks to the specially designed sport ear hooks that hold firmly when you are on the move. Whether you’re jogging or working out at the gym, our cordless earbuds stay snugly in your ears while you’re in motion - ensuring that you never miss a beat. Let the music power you through your entire workout.   V-Powerbuds Pro has brilliant performance, so your training can be the best. It tracks heart rate precisely along with oxygen levels using a built-in pulse oximeter that takes its measurements directly from the ears, which is much more accurate than readings taken at the wrist.  Heart Rate Tracking With this system, V-Powerbuds Pro tracks heart rate more precisely than even a sport watch.  First, it tracks PPG heart rate within the ear. Measuring from an enclosed space such as the ear means that the measurement process is less disturbed by external light, which can affect heart rate readings taken at the wrist by a sport watch. Then, because the distribution of blood vessels in the human ear is more extensive than that in the wrist, more data will be collected, analyzed and recorded.  V-Powerbuds Pro helps you maintain the perfect heart rate for effective exercise and optimal calorie burning. It monitors your heart rate and gives warnings when an unusually high or low heart rate is detected. It makes sure you’re getting the most from your workout while staying at a level that’s safe and effective for you. Therefore, you can reach and maintain your target heart rate safely even during intense exercise.  Oxygen Tracking V-Powerbuds Pro also tracks your oxygen uptake as well respiration rate to help you crush your fitness goals. A higher oxygen consumption allows one to produce more energy, thereby performing more work. As top athletes know, oxygen consumption is the ""gold standard"" measure of overall fitness.    More Sports Data V-Powerbuds Pro captures and records key stats like time, cadence, pace alerts, distance, and calories burned, etc. Also, a comprehensive workout history and achievements page puts your workout data instantly at your fingertips to track your progress from day to day, helping you to follow your progress and achieve your fitness goals.    Accurate Data Tracking  Using an innovative patented technology, V-Powerbuds pro tracks Photoplethysmography PPG heart rate, an optical measurement method that uses a light source and advanced photodetector to measure blood circulation at the skin. These measurements taken in the ear are more accurate than the heart rate measured at the wrist by a typical sports watch.Here is an example. One subject wore V-Powerbuds pro TWS earbuds and chest-strap heart rate monitor at the same time while running on a treadmill. Here is the heart rate comparison results:   According to the four tests above, the data collected through V-Powerbuds Pro are as accurate as a professional chest belt.    Offline Voice Control  Using proprietary offline voice control, V-Powerbuds Pro can even control a smartphone by voice commands when your smartphone is offline.This system can conveniently answer the phone, play music with simple voice commands.   Noise-cancelling Design for Voice Wake Up   Simply wake up your V-Powerbuds Pro by voice. Combined with their advanced noise-cancelling feature, the earbuds can detect and respond to your voice commands faster and more accurately.  A DSP for voice wake-up is integrated in V-Powerbuds Pro. Two digital PDM (pulse density modulation) microphones are connected to the DSP front-end, one for voice acquisition and the other for noise reduction. Therefore, this product has the function of wake-up noise reduction, which can ensure the accuracy of wake-up and offline speech recognition even in noisy environments.   Passive Noise Isolation V-Powerbuds Pro uses an advanced in-ear design that can passively isolate outside noise and provides you with better entertainment in busy and noisy environments such as in the gym or outdoors.     Great Audio Performance For any TWS earbuds, sound quality is paramount. Equipped with a Qualcomm® aptX decoder and high sensitivity, V-Powerbuds Pro provides excellent audio performance. The bass is powerful, tight, and impactful, the highs are detailed but not harsh, and the mids are buttery smooth.   Endurance With a top quality rechargeable battery built-in and a high capacity 1000 mAh charging case, the earbuds keep you going for longer workouts, travel and all-day use, delivering outstanding performance for 24 hours per charge.  Sweat Through Your WorkoutV-Powerbuds Pro is IPX5 weatherproof. It's prepared to accompany your all sorts of outdoor adventures.       Risks and challengesWith our years of experience in the TWS sports earbuds industry, we are very confident with our process and production schedule for V-Power Buds Pro TWS Sport Earbuds.

More Fun, More Convenient. 1Cables is the world’s first, smart data sync cable. It breaks the limitations on cell phone operating systems by connecting to multiple devices with a single cable through a unique, 2-in-1, male/female switchable connector designed for smartphones. For instance, it can connect your cell phone to a camera to sync photos and videos; it can also connect your cell phone to many other external, expanding devices such as a mouse, a keyboard or a gaming controller. It can even connect your cell phone to another cell phone that is running out of battery and charge it up. It makes your cell phone work like a computer.Male/female switchable connector designAs a transformative USB connector, 1CABLES's unlimited function extension is made possible by its instant transformation between male and female with a single switch.Push the button down to switch to a female USB connector — now it becomes an unlimited, multifunction cable that can connect to many external devices.Push the button up to switch to a male USB connector and restore to the original data sync cable. Download photos and videos from a cameraAfter shooting with a SLR camera, you can directly connect the camera to your cellphone using 1Cables to download photos and videos, and instantly share them on social media, all without a computer.Connect to a mouse or a keyboardWith 1Cables, you can directly connect your cell phone with any USB mouse or keyboard (iOS system only supports connection with keyboard, not with mouse), to take care of business anytime, anywhere.Connect to a USB flash driveDirectly connect your computer with a USB flash drive to conveniently and quickly sync data and files. (iOS system only supports sync of photos and videos.)Connect to a printerWith 1Cables, you can directly connect your cell phone to a printer to print and make copies of your photos anytime, anywhere, without worrying about having an internet connection of any kind. (No need to install Printershare. Currently does not support iOS system.)Connect to a game controllerNot enough to play with only one game controller? With 1Cables, you can connect your cell phone to a game controller while playing video games for a more exciting playing experience. Charge a cellphone with a cellphoneDepleted the power of your cell phone while playing games? With 1Cables, you can connect and charge your cell phone with another cell phone in case of emergency. You will be prepared for any contingency. (Currently, this function only supports Android systems.)Apple’s new MacBook Pro cannot connect to other USB devices because it has only Type C jack. With 1Cables and its unique male/female switchable connector, you can connect your MacBook Pro or MacBook to all other devices, such as iPhones, USB flash drives, portable hard drives, etc. 1Cables makes your MacBook Pro work together with any other peripherals seamlessly with continuity.In the era of quick charging, you need a safe charging cable.

<p><img alt=""livingroom"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fruitanddreams.com/files/naslovna%20nizja%20slika.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With built in batteries that are not only used to power high quality speakers inside the Sliced Dock, but also used to charge your smartphone while it is connected to the dock, this dock belongs to the unique category and is probably light years ahead from others. <strong>With Sliced Dock you will always have your smartphone battery at 100% beacause you can place the Sliced Dock anywhere in or outside your house with no need to hunt for power adapters and usb cables.</strong> Built in state of the art Li-ion batteries make the dock portable so you can take it anywhere. And when you take your dock anywhere you will also have a portable battery to charge your smartphone at your disposal.</p>
<p><img alt=""macanddock"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fruitanddreams.com/files/IMG_2279.JPG%20(2).JPG"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Here is the main functionality:</h3>
<p><img alt=""nexttotv"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fruitanddreams.com/files/IMG_2276.JPG%20(2).JPG"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>With HDMI OUT you can easely connect it to your HDTV and enjoy watching movies or just mirror your device's screen on that big TV.</li>
<li>With AUDIO LINE OUT (left &amp; right) you can connect Sliced Dock to any external receiver/speaker.</li>
<li>With AUDIO IN you can use internal Sliced Dock speakers for playing music from any mp3/mp4 player. Play music from virtually any device.</li>
<li>With SECOND CHARGE USB you can charge any other device besides your docked smartphone, just as long it can be charged via USB power supply.</li>
<li>With internal battery you can recharge your smartphone up to 10 times without recharging you Sliced Dock.</li>
</ul><h3><span>With normal smartphone charge routine you can use Sliced Dock for 8 days with no need of charging your Sliced Dock's internal battery.  </span></h3>
<p>But we have not stopped here.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Why manufacture a dock that supports only one brand of smartphones?</span></h3>
<p>Sliced Dock can be used with iPhones (apple 30 pin and apple lightning connector) and all of the other smartphones which have micro usb connector. For optimal position connector on the bottom of the smartphone is advised. Works great with Samsung Galaxy S2,S3 and Google Nexus and many others.</p>

How we started ?


why must all docks look like docks?


why not make a portable dock that would also charge your smartphone anywhere?



why not have a unique dock?

We believe we have answered all of these questions with Sliced Dock.
We believe that the dock should look nice even if it doesn't have smartphone on it. 
Check out the perk for $30! Use your imagination and get Sliced Dock+HDMI for only $30.
Send us your engravement idea to: info@fruitanddreams.com
Simplify the way you charge your smartphone.

With built in batteries that are not only used to power high quality speakers inside the Sliced Dock, but also used to charge your smartphone while it is connected to the dock, this dock belongs to the unique category and is probably light years ahead from others. With Sliced Dock you will always have your smartphone battery at 100% beacause you can place the Sliced Dock anywhere in or outside your house with no need to hunt for power adapters and usb cables. Built in state of the art Li-ion batteries make the dock portable so you can take it anywhere. And when you take your dock anywhere you will also have a portable battery to charge your smartphone at your disposal.

Here is the main functionality:


With HDMI OUT you can easely connect it to your HDTV and enjoy watching movies or just mirror your device's screen on that big TV.
With AUDIO LINE OUT (left & right) you can connect Sliced Dock to any external receiver/speaker.
With AUDIO IN you can use internal Sliced Dock speakers for playing music from any mp3/mp4 player. Play music from virtually any device.
With SECOND CHARGE USB you can charge any other device besides your docked smartphone, just as long it can be charged via USB power supply.
With internal battery you can recharge your smartphone up to 10 times without recharging you Sliced Dock.
With normal smartphone charge routine you can use Sliced Dock for 8 days with no need of charging your Sliced Dock's internal battery.  
But we have not stopped here.
Why manufacture a dock that supports only one brand of smartphones?
Sliced Dock can be used with iPhones (apple 30 pin and apple lightning connector) and all of the other smartphones which have micro usb connector. For optimal position connector on the bottom of the smartphone is advised. Works great with Samsung Galaxy S2,S3 and Google Nexus and many others.

 
Why charge only one smartphone at a time ?
On the back of the dock we also inlcuded SECOND CHARGE USB  for charging any other device simultaneously while charging your docked smartphone. For example if your friend's phone battery is dead he can quickly recharge it on your dock wherever you are.
Customize your Sliced Dock.

Every Sliced Dock is unique.
The area where your Iphone leans on is made completely out of matte glass, iluminated by LED lights from inside the dock. 
IN GLASS PANEL YOU CAN TELL US WHAT TO ENGRAVE. IT IS TOTALLY UP TO YOU.
Just send us text/symbol or combination of those and we will professionally engrave it in your dock so it will always be iluminated (perfect for birthdays, christmas gifts and several other occasions).
Sliced Dock comes in many colors. Pick yours.

Two color edition - choose two colors you like and add more uniqueness to your Sliced Dock.
Innovative way of controling your music.
You can adjust music loudness by rotating stem on the top of the Sliced Dock.

 
Buttonless design.
To turn OFF/ON the glass ilumination and battery indicator just touch the aluminum panel that is around the connector for your smartphone. THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU SHUT DOWN THE ENTIRE DOCK BUT ONLY ILUMINATION AND BATTERY INDICATOR. You can still listen to music and charge your smartphone.
Made with astonishing attention to details.
The body of Sliced Dock is plastic but all of the key components are made out of aluminum and glass for additional quality and fine touch.
Leaves on the top of the dock are made from aluminum and also come in handy when you want to move your dock around. You can easely grab the dock by the stem and take it anywhere you like. It's unique structure gives the leaves and stem incredible hardness and support for the whole dock.
Also very useful for tablets. iPad and Galaxy Tab.

 
We also designed Sliced Dock Mini
We have created Sliced Dock Mini more portable but still with a lot of functionality.
It is a perfect smartphone accessory which is easy to carry around and looks beautiful.
The Sliced Dock Mini specifications are bellow:

 
 
 
How will we use donated money:

 
We can’t wait to share this great project with you. 
You will have the satisfaction that you helped us with our project when you  will see Sliced Dock on the shelf of many electronics store.
Why do we need funds for?
