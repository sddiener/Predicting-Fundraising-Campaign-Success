<h3>
<strong>On April 5th of this year,</strong> <strong>while sitting behind a computer running powerpoint for a conference called ""Source Code: Reprogram for Tomorrow or Repeat Yesterday"", I was ready to bawl my eyes out.</strong>
</h3>
<p>As I'd been changing the slides and singing along with the music, I caught myself giving sidelong glances at the audience to see if anyone was looking at me. And wondered why I did it.</p>
<p>I'd done this often, especially when singing during a worship service in church, wondering if anyone else was listening to me. Was I too loud? Too quiet? A pleasure to listen to? Did I sound like I was focussing on God? It was downright distracting. I thought I'd gotten over it.</p>
<p>And there I was, doing it again at a conference while doing powerpoint, and I asked myself why.</p>
<p>And the answer broke me.</p>
<p>""Does anyone notice me?""</p>
<p>You know how some things can just jab right down past all the layers and stuck right into the depths of your heart and twist? That did it for me. All I wanted to do was cry like a little baby, but I had a job to do, so I held it in for the whole evening, telling those tears with the utmost tenderness: ""I'll deal with you when I get home.""</p>
<p>Which I did. When I got home, I went into my bedroom and cried and cried and cried.</p>
<p>Memories had been surfacing the whole day, memories of friends who had never communicated with me, people who had acted like they didn't care about me, people who I had desperately wanted to connect with but who did nothing to connect with me.</p>
<p>All I wanted to do was cry like I had when I was little, those times when you didn't worry about stopping and you just cried on your mom's shirt until you had cried all the things you could cry.</p>
<p>And I remembered.</p>
<p>When I was nine, my parents informed me that we would be moving to Alabama, a world away from everything I knew. When I was ten, we were there. And I fell into a depression.</p>
<p>Legit depression, complete with suicidal thoughts and periods where I'd forgotten how to feel.</p>
<p>And, in the moments when I was bawling my eyes out before going to sleep, I would pray to God for a best friend, someone who would know what I was going through but wasn't themselves. Someone who could be like a big sister. Someone who would listen.</p>
<p>He said he'd give me her.</p>
<p>But it didn't happen. I had to wait.</p>
<p>So I asked him to talk to me. To say something.</p>
<p>All I heard was static.</p>
<p>So I asked him to hold me, like I wanted my mom to hold me, but I didn't dare go and interrupt her in the night because she needed her sleep (I'd already asked him to wake up my parents and tell them to come to me, but that hadn't happened, either).</p>
<p>But, no matter what happened, I couldn't tell if the arms I felt were real or just in my imagination.</p>
<p>Finally, as I realized the night of the conference, despite going back to God every time I couldn't handle it, I believed that God had abandoned me. And now there I was, sobbing into my blankets, telling him that it wasn't enough that he noticed me, because he. Had. Left. Me.</p>
<p>And I had decided to get everyone else to notice me, but they hadn't because they were all noticing themselves (no hard feelings about that, really) and even if the whole world noticed me it wouldn't matter because I was empty on the inside.</p>
<p>Because. He. Had. Left. Me.</p>
<p>That night, though, I didn't want to be empty any more, so I crawled back into his arms, accused him of abandonment, and begged him to show me the truth of what had happened all those years ago. The real truth. The one that confirmed the God I've always loved lives up to his word. The one that confirmed that he would never leave me. The one that confirmed that he had worked for my benefit and my benefit alone.</p>
<p>It was a tall order. I figured, if anyone could fill it, they'd be worthy of my life.</p>
<p>I'd be lying if I told you that <em>The Illuminated Heart</em> was about Dagný. It's about me. It's about me in that moment trying to make sense of a life I'd lived with the black stain of depression clawing through it even after the depression had gone. It's about me in all my inadequacies and failings, in all my disconnect from myself and all my illogical choices. In all my coy attempts to manipulate God with sporadically placed trust.</p>
<p>Obviously, I didn't meet a talking bear, and neither have I faced the undead, Norse or otherwise.</p>
<p>But I did find that life is much less about conflict and much more about a change in perspective.</p>
<p>Because when I had been so focussed on exactly how I wanted God to speak to me, he'd been saying something else:</p>
<p>""Tell me how you feel.""</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I didn't even know, half the time. Because I had no-one else to talk to, and I needed to pour out my heart before it ate me from the inside.</p>
<p>But, most of all, because he had noticed me.</p>
<p>He had noticed me bawling my eyes out.</p>

'Destiny and Intuition were guardians of the Evolving Thread, dear and trusted fellow travelers for Aeons.
And, as had happened so many times before ... they sensed a new and distant Pulse resonating just beyond the visible.  A Pulse so powerful that even Perception needed recalibrating not once, not twice, but thrice.
As they slowly leaned towards the Pulse, they glimpsed the emerging outline of a Portal, opening to the most magnificent multi-dimensional world imaginable.  It was a world where the Attractor Field lived and Higher Consciousness evolved.  Listening deeper and deeper ... the Pulse responded, and released a Wave ~ ~ ~ ~ full of glistening gossamer, and weaving threads of Philosophy, Subtle Artistry and Conscious Evolution into the richest of tapestries ... and the Portal expanded.

Who am I 
I am Sarah Whiteley, author, poet, practice leader and action researcher of systemic transformation, subtle artistry and conscious evolution.  I am also a philosopher, tracker, field-weaver and host.
I am now developing the Philosophy and 'Subtle Artistry of Conscious Evolution' via a Combined MA/PhD program with The Wisdom School of Graduate Studies at The Ubiquity University.
 
Action Research So Far
My research-thread has evolved through co-creating a series of practice 'portals' that include co-initiating the global practice, The Art of Hosting, co-founding the systemic learning centre, Axladitsa Avatakia, Greece; co-evolving the systemic pattern and practice of Living Wholeness  and founding Conscious Evolution. 
The Research findings has been shared via three self-published books: two poetry: 'The Order of Creation' © 2011 and 'Release the Winged Ones' © 2012 - that chronicle and illuminate personal-to-universal journeying through 'poetic motifs'; and, 'The Fine Line of Destiny' © 2012 (Limited Edition), an autobiographical memoir, Modern Myth and Practice guide - that chronicles the evolutionary arc of living wholeness and its service to systemic transformation and conscious, intentional evolution, including the narratives of portals (named above) and, practice-stories from Greece, the U.S., the UK, Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.
The three books (including 'The Fine Line of Destiny' Second Edition* © 2013) will act as Credits for my Masters Degree.
 
The Next Wave of Research
I invite you to support, stengthen and co-evolve the next phase of research within my MA/PhD Studies.
Since launching this Campaign, my participation in the MA/PhD program has been officially accepted - 25.7.13 - and therefore my research process has evolved: from 'Scoping' to 'Study-Engagement' and shifted in timing, not content: 
My Research Intention and Core Questions have also been Approved, and remain as previously shown:
My intention is to chronicle the multiple waves and intentional moments and movements of intersection between Destiny, Intuition, Subtle Artistry, Elder Wisdom, Earth Wisdom and Cosmology - to illuminate the keys to conscious evolution and the evolution of consciousness at this time on the planet.
1. How does Intuitive Leadership best serve conscious evolution now?
2. What Earth-wisdom is held within 'grooves', energy 'ley' lines and power portals (places of power) and how do we create a coherent field to accelerate the collective sphere of consciousness, including people and place?
 
3. What 'Ancients' and 'Elder' wisdom is most needed at this time, and how might we bear witness to and accelerate key transmissions from 'wisdom-holders' to those ready to receive them?

PREVIOUSLY ... in the first 10 day of the Campaign: I wrote: I will participate in a research-scoping journey - that will include a Workshop, exploring Earth-Wisdom of the Canyonlands of Utah, and being in Council with an Elder Pipe Carrier, in the Western United States.
 
Now ...
 
The research-scoping journey elements have evolved into Independent Study (details to be co-designed with WU Faculty) and linked in space-time when journeying to Mexico to participate in the global learning community gathering of Graduate Studies: 'Exploring the Edge of Evolution, The Intimate Community as Leader' at the Teotihuacan Pyramids, the first Credit-program for my Studies.  

*Additional monies, beyond the Campaign 'target' will go towards book, poetry and research writing in the Fall.  The Workshop previously part of the research scoping, will not be possible, but attended at a later date.
 
*Therefore 'Perks' that offer 'hot off the press' poetry from the U.S. journey will now be received later in the Fall.

 
 
Contribute

By contributing to this Campaign, you will weave yourself into the evolving thread of research, and will specifically support:
The first phase of Research in the U.S and Mexico as part of my Combined MA/PhD, including Travel, workshop fees and subsistence.
The writing of poetry, harvest articles and blogs 'live from the road', including supporting the publishing of my 3rd Book of Poetry © 2014.  Funds will also support the writing of the first of the 'Subtle Artists Storybook Series: 'The Fine Line of Destiny, by Destiny' and research for the second Book of this series, 'When Destiny meets Intuition' part of the ongoing work, in support of my Studies.
Research Events and Gatherings during and post-learning journey.  I intend to offer opportunities with a network of resonant practitioners to co-create, illuminate and amplify the evolving thread of this research. Insights will contribute to the research and written outputs.

<p><b><i>""...dry eye, a condition that
affects as many as 25 million Americans...It's an epidemic now...""</i></b><b> - Wall Street Journal, Tuesday, July 9, 2013</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u>My Goal with a Successful Raise:</u></b></p>
<p>If you research the dry eye blogs, it doesn't take long before you read some of the terrible stories that sufferers are enduring.   Many of the stories have a similar tone - the pain is constant, the quality of life has been lost, it's difficult to stay focused, depression has set in, the pain makes it difficult to keep a job, there is no cure for dry eye, some even share their thoughts of suicide.  Many of the stories remind me of what I went through.   </p>
<p>My goal is to get this information out to as many of those people as I can.  The technique I used to solve my problem may not solve everyone's problem but I want them to have another option - a reason for hope, a chance to get back to living a normal life.</p>
<p>The book is complete but I would like to raise the funds to create a print version and use that print version as a way to market the book to eye specialists, holistic providers and media and book stores throughout the country.  If we don't raise the money, I won't immediately create a print version which will slow down my efforts to get the word out.</p>

<p><b><u>My Story</u></b></p>
<p>Hi!  My name is Anthony
DeSimone and I am a former sufferer of severe dry eye.  I discovered
a solution to solving my dry eye and it worked so well for me I decided to
write a book about it to teach my technique to anyone suffering from dry
eye.  I’m the author of the book “Dry Eye No More – how to solve your dry
eye naturally.”  Let me share some of my story with you.</p>
<p>My eyes were always dry and red and
I was living in constant pain. My eyes would feel extremely heavy and every
time I blinked it felt like I was rubbing sandpaper over my eyeballs.</p>

<p>I was in so much pain, I began going to the eye doctors for pain relief treatment once or twice a month to the point that I became a regular at the office.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>I became reclusive because I did not want people to see how bad my eyes looked and I did not want to talk about it.  I was also having problems with the brightness of office and store lights.  It got so bad, I began wearing sunglasses at night while driving to block out the headlights of the oncoming cars and the ones that were flashing in my rear view and side mirrors.  As bad as I was feeling then, I began to worry about how much worse it was going to be in a year or five years or twenty years.</p>

My Story
Hi!  My name is Anthony
DeSimone and I am a former sufferer of severe dry eye.  I discovered
a solution to solving my dry eye and it worked so well for me I decided to
write a book about it to teach my technique to anyone suffering from dry
eye.  I’m the author of the book “Dry Eye No More – how to solve your dry
eye naturally.”  Let me share some of my story with you.
My eyes were always dry and red and
I was living in constant pain. My eyes would feel extremely heavy and every
time I blinked it felt like I was rubbing sandpaper over my eyeballs.
 


I was in so much pain, I began going to the eye doctors for pain relief treatment once or twice a month to the point that I became a regular at the office.



I became reclusive because I did not want people to see how bad my eyes looked and I did not want to talk about it.  I was also having problems with the brightness of office and store lights.  It got so bad, I began wearing sunglasses at night while driving to block out the headlights of the oncoming cars and the ones that were flashing in my rear view and side mirrors.  As bad as I was feeling then, I began to worry about how much worse it was going to be in a year or five years or twenty years.



I tried many prescription and non-prescription drops and ointments and nothing seemed to help.  If anything, it seemed like my eyes were getting worse.



I was having extreme difficulty with performing my job and living my life. My eyes were on fire! 



And unfortunately, the worst part was the experts - the eye doctors - had no answers.  I discovered there is no cure for Dry Eye.
I realized I needed to solve my own problem.  So, after some trial and error, I created a technique that included data collection of my day-to-day life.  I began measuring the dryness in the air and comparing it to the dryness in my eyes and after several days, I began seeing trends that I never noticed before.
I thought I was always in the same amount of pain, but I discovered that wasn’t true.  Once I began measuring and rating my eye dryness, I discovered there were times during each day where my eyes would feel better.
By measuring and charting the dryness, it became very easy for me to recognize the activities that were causing the greatest amount of dryness and the activities and procedures that were helping reduce the dryness.
I began to experiment and discovered how to combine these activities that made my eyes feel better until I put the right formula together to become pain free; free from dry eye, every day.



This book shares my story and provides the step-by-step process on how to solve your moderate to severe dry eye problem without prescription drugs and without paying significant amounts of money. The book also includes all the easy-to-use data collection templates needed to get started right away.

<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Summer Rayne Oakes and I'm an environmental scientist and entomologist by training and have done quite a bit of work in the field—from reclaiming mine sites to working in agroforestry. Sometimes it's challenging to communicate how these efforts impact us, so in 2005 I moved to Brooklyn to explore how I could apply my environmental knowledge to industries that noticeably impact our everyday lives—from what we wear to what we eat.</p>
<p>Growing up in the country, I had never imagined myself living in the city for so long. One way I have felt at ""home"" in the city has been by bringing and caring for plants indoors. I think a lot of people are like me—rural transplants in an urban environment, seeking a way to live more sustainably and in sync with nature. Even for those of us who have never stepped barefoot on a blade of grass, there's something inherently in us that is connected to nature—on a much deeper, biological level. </p>
<p>In 2016 my home went viral due to the amount of plants I have (I grow ~700 plants indoors!) This spawned much curiosity, excitement, questions and intrigue, so that's how <i><strong>How to Make a Plant Love You: Houseplant Masterclass</strong> </i>was born! This is a way for newbie plant lovers and well-seasoned plantaholics get to know more about plants, demystify plant care, and create the indoor jungle of their dreams. I would like to see all of us be able to have a closer relationship with nature—both indoors and out—and if we can do that through learning to <i>think like a plant, </i>then my mission will feel complete! </p>

</div></div>","Overview:
Hi! My name is Summer Rayne Oakes and I'm an environmental scientist and entomologist by training and have done quite a bit of work in the field—from reclaiming mine sites to working in agroforestry. Sometimes it's challenging to communicate how these efforts impact us, so in 2005 I moved to Brooklyn to explore how I could apply my environmental knowledge to industries that noticeably impact our everyday lives—from what we wear to what we eat.
Growing up in the country, I had never imagined myself living in the city for so long. One way I have felt at ""home"" in the city has been by bringing and caring for plants indoors. I think a lot of people are like me—rural transplants in an urban environment, seeking a way to live more sustainably and in sync with nature. Even for those of us who have never stepped barefoot on a blade of grass, there's something inherently in us that is connected to nature—on a much deeper, biological level. 
In 2016 my home went viral due to the amount of plants I have (I grow ~700 plants indoors!) This spawned much curiosity, excitement, questions and intrigue, so that's how How to Make a Plant Love You: Houseplant Masterclass was born! This is a way for newbie plant lovers and well-seasoned plantaholics get to know more about plants, demystify plant care, and create the indoor jungle of their dreams. I would like to see all of us be able to have a closer relationship with nature—both indoors and out—and if we can do that through learning to think like a plant, then my mission will feel complete! 

About the Campaign
Some of what this course will cover includes: 




You can also plan on having beautiful imagery, illustrations and animated visuals to help you not only understand plant care—but help you think more like a plant!
 

What We Need & What You Get:
We already raised the basic funding to pay our artists, illustrators, editors and videographers to help complete the course, but I'd love to raise the rest of the funds to meet some of our stretch goals to take the online experience offline. Some of these include

Producing How to Make a Plant Love You tours and in-person workshops across various cities—connecting with plant friends in real life (#PlantFriendsIRL); 
Creating a hardcover book
Donating 500 copies of the book to under-served schools and libraries; 
Creating and performing immersive experiences across cities, and 
Putting How To Make a Plant Love You: Houseplant Masterclass principles to work by helping refurbish and improve three community gardens in Brooklyn, NY.

We'd love your help in achieving these goals!

<h3>CAMPAIGN CLOSES APRIL 26, 2020!!! BE THE FIRST TO SNAG A COPY!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>WHATS THE BOOK ABOUT</strong></u></p>
<p>In <strong>Bring the Joy</strong>, Jessica Janzen shares her experience in following those nudges of her heart to find true and lasting joy. From the bliss of her dramatic, romantic saga with her now husband, to the trials and triumph of her career journey as a young woman, to the devastating loss of her son when he was only six months old, Jessica’s commitment to follow the nudges of her heart have seen her through every season. Through her hilarious, inspiring stories and refreshing honesty, Jessica will challenge you to start looking for ways to bring more joy to your life and the lives of those around you. Life lived to the fullest can only happen when you bring the joy.</p>
<p><strong>WHY A CAMPAIGN</strong></p>
<p>So why a crowd funding campaign? Writing a book is an expensive undertaking It will be about a $90,000 project when it is done. <strong>WOWZERS!</strong> Between editing, designing, printing, publishing and marketing the book, it all adds up quick. This pre-order campaign will give the project a HUGE jump start, and also give you an exclusive discounted price with fun perks! Definitely a win-win situation.</p>
<p>By contributing to this project, you'll not only be personally inspired by Jess's story, you'll help thousands of others be inspired as well. Our hope is that everyone who reads Jess's story will know, ""If she can do it, I can too.""</p>
<p>Jess's hope is that it won't take losing your child to wake you up to living your fullest, most joy-filled life. A life on purpose – for a purpose. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who is Jessica?</h3>
<p>Jessica Janzen Olstad is a speaker, social media influencer, clothing line designer, and the founder and Executive Director of the <a href=""http://www.loveforlewiston.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Love for Lewiston Foundation</a>. Raised a farm girl, she's now a city dweller living in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Four days before her 30th birthday, she ditched her corporate gig and the 9 -5 grind to live her most authentic, bold, joyful life. She had no idea her world was about to get flipped upside down. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567887023/vzjlsnfl0ru7iri9hgzx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In November 2016, Jessica lost her 6 month old son Lewiston to a rare genetic disease called SMA (Spinal Muscular Atrophy). It took her losing her son to really wake Jess up to living her life to the fullest. She hopes by sharing her story through this book, others will be motivated to chase their big dreams – right now – without having to go through tragedy. </p>
<p>Jessica is most proud of being a wife to her hubby ""Hot Ronnie"" and Mama to her three kids Swayzie, Lewiston and Hollis. When she's not busy with her family, Jessica runs the Love for Lewiston Foundation which has raised over $620,000 for the SMA &amp; Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise <strong>$90,000.  BIG NUMBER - CRAZY RIGHT - BUT PUBLISHING A BOOK IS NO JOKE!. </strong>The US Dollar is strong and the Canadian dollar is not doing so well right now, along with editing, printing, audio recordings, consulting fees it all adds up. Your support will get the book from manuscript status into the hands of experienced publishers (<a href=""https://thefeddagency.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Fedd Agency</a>), and eventually printed and into your hands! Working with The Fedd Agency is super important to Jess because, though she loves telling her story in person, writing it can be a challenge. The Fedd Agency will help Jess <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">tell her story, her family's story, and Lewiston's story with excellence. By writing this book, so many more can hear it than Jess could possibly tell face to face.  It is a dive into the mess of life and not just in 15 seconds clips on Instagram. </span></p>
<p>When you contribute to this campaign you get discount pricing on her book ""Bring the Joy"" and fun perks only available during this presale. </p>
</div><div><p>All money raised will go towards publishing and printing the first run of books, whether our goal is met or not. You will have the book in your hands by May 2020, even if it means taking out a loan or maxing our credit cards - which we really don't want to do! </p></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This book is essentially a play book of how to take your life experiences (the good, bad and ugly) learn from them, and leverage them to bring the most impact and joy into your life. As many books as we can sell, that's how many lives will potentially be changed by this message. The potential for the impact of this story is unlimited.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge is to raise the full amount (it's a lot - we know!) But even if the full amount isn't raised, we will take out a small business loan to complete the project on time. Jessica has set a goal and won't stop until this project is complete. </p>
<p>Another challenge is the self doubt and discouragement that can come out with putting yourself out there for a project like this. That's why Jess is working with a book launch coach and a team of people to support and hold her accountable to her plan!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know not everyone will be able to contribute financially to this project. But another powerful way to help is by sharing this campaign with your circle of friends. Posting about it on facebook or instagram, or emailing friends you think might be interested will make a huge difference in getting the word out! This will make a perfect gift for Christmas - we will have postcards explaining your gift to stick in a stocking  or wrap up - please just remember the book will not be printed until May 2020. </p>
<p>Also if you have connections to any local media outlets, or people you think we should connect with, please don't hesitate to reach out and let us know. </p>

<p></p>
<p></p><p>The
 storms were already pretty bad when I was
a kid, and the world was failing, but we still held out hope. 
Multi-legged funnel storms stalked across the land, whirling away 
everything in
their paths. You never knew who you'd be losing. Drenching storms 
threatened to
flood us out if we tried to go underground. If it wasn't storms, it was 
fires.
Fresh water was too precious to use on fires we couldn't control anyway 
so they raged across the land unchecked. The
power grids fell and all my books disappeared with the last battery 
charge.
Then everyone got sick. We ran out of medicine, or we couldn't get the
medicine, or we didn't have the right kind of medicine. I don't quite 
know, I was very young. Not many of us survived
after all that. We did what we could to organize, but we didn't do it 
well
enough.</p>
<p>We tried to form into organized Trader Guilds,
those few of us who remained. I thought we were doing it to organize our people
into more effective units, each of which would cooperate for the betterment of
the whole. That isn't what happened. Now the most ruthless are in charge, hoarding the best resources for themselves, the
majority of people enslaved without a clue that things were once
better and could be again. But those two, they might be the answer. </p>
<p>I
 raised Mark myself. I saw something heroic
in the boy when he put himself out there to protect the little girl he'd
 just met. I was hopeful he would be the one to turn things around. 
Maybe the task was too big for him,
maybe he just couldn't understand the importance. So far, he's been a 
minor
disappointment to me, but I still hope for him. </p>
<p>Lissa's a different story. Her mother was a
beautiful woman who couldn't abide being locked within doors to keep her safe
from the Slavers. I helped her set up a secret Teaching Room where we could
discreetly send students to learn some of the things the Trader Guilds tried to
keep hidden from their slaves. She kept Lissa away from here, most of the time.
I don't know where - she'd never tell me. But she taught that girl a lot, much
more than what we have in the Teaching Room. And Lissa has her spirit. It will be hard to keep that girl down. </p><p><span>I wish I could help, but dead men
can't interfere in the lives of the living. Now that Lissa's grown and making
her own choices, what can she accomplish, and will my Mark play a role? </span></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/362456/files/20140210224456-Wolf_River.jpg?1392101096"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3>

<li>Climate change</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Alternative farming

<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Eco-punk (steampunk based on

</ul><p>By including these topics within an engaging work of
fiction, this story will be able to introduce more people to the concepts
surrounding climate change and inspire more pro-active action on the part of
its readers. With a strong female engineering-oriented protagonist, it will
also provide girls with a positive role model and encourage innovation among
readers.</p>

It’s fiction, make it up.</b></h4>
<p>Great question and one I’ve heard before. I’m sure lots of folks want
 to know this one. I can make up a lot of things, and since this is 
primarily a work of fiction set in a hypothetical future, I will need to
 make some things up no matter how good my research. However, having 
grown up in multiple areas of the country, I know that the feel of a 
place is often much different from the reality reflected in books and on
 the internet. I can learn a lot through reference materials, but I’ll 
learn a lot more a lot faster if I actually go there and see things like
 the lay of the land, the types of vegetation and how it interacts both 
in cultivated areas and in the more untamed portions. These are things 
books don’t often talk about directly, but which are the breath of life 
in creative works.</p>
<h4><b>Why this region?</b></h4>
<p>The Mississippi Delta is the poorest region of our country where 
people live in Third World conditions. In spite of this, the people who 
live there have shown incredible innovation and resilience using 
whatever comes their way to help them scratch out a living from the land
 without the benefit of modern education, technology or industry. It is 
that spirit of never giving up, always using the tools and materials 
that come your way to create what you need, and inventiveness that will 
lead to the development of a vibrant, sustainable community which 
produces the main character, Lissa, and provides, through her, hope for 
the future.</p>
<h4><b>Is this science fiction? How realistic?</b></h4>
<p>Technically speaking, yes, this could easily be classified as science
 fiction in that it tells of a future world and focuses on the science 
and technology of the time. Because much of our current technology is 
rendered useless by the climactic and population changes that have taken
 place, this distinction may be called into question a bit; however, 
book two of the series will take us more into what I’m calling eco-punk 
(a derivative of steampunk) and the entire story is based on real 
principles of science including scientific predictions of a future Earth
 and real technological concepts that may or may not have been proven 
yet.</p>
<h4><b>Is it strictly or predominantly written to raise awareness or is it more of a novel?</b></h4>
<p>It is my belief that every story has the power to change the world if
 it gets into the right hands, captures the imagination, and provides 
room to grow. Most of the efforts to raise awareness about climate 
change have focused on delivering the facts – for good reason. Important
 decisions that can drastically affect the economy should be based on 
scientific evidence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that isn’t how human brains work. People only get 
excited/involved when their emotions and imaginations are engaged. The 
goal of this book, which is very decidedly focused on being a novel, is 
to engage imaginations and emotions based on real facts and data as well
 as the most up-to-date scientific predictions I can find. The eco-punk 
elements are designed to give readers a direction to follow regardless 
of their current living circumstances or socioeconomic status.</p>
<h4><b>What experience do you bring in this area and how will that help the project?</b></h4>
<p>My background is full of writing – as a journalist, a freelance 
technical writer, a copywriter, a grant writer, a creative writer, and 
as a teacher. As a Master’s student, I specialized in American 
literature and Rhetoric, so I understand how the written word can be 
used to greatest effect. I’m also a member of Al Gore’s Climate Reality 
Project Team and have been a passionate advocate for the environment for
 several years. My proximity to experts and leaders in the field through
 the various positions I’ve held both enable me to see the ‘big picture’
 as well as understand the frustration and helpless feelings of the 
average individual. I’m also well aware of the importance of providing 
solid, accurate, scientifically-based information to be sure readers are
 able to make an educated choice for themselves and I want to introduce 
the excitement of innovation and discovery to my readers through the 
inventive and resourceful character of Lissa, a backwoods engineer 
without a clue that what she does is special.</p><br/><p></p>

What do you want to talk about?

A futuristic tale of climate change, human survival, and rebuilding society to sustainably co-exist with the Earth.A Novel Set in a Future World

The
 storms were already pretty bad when I was
a kid, and the world was failing, but we still held out hope. 
Multi-legged funnel storms stalked across the land, whirling away 
everything in
their paths. You never knew who you'd be losing. Drenching storms 
threatened to
flood us out if we tried to go underground. If it wasn't storms, it was 
fires.
Fresh water was too precious to use on fires we couldn't control anyway 
so they raged across the land unchecked. The
power grids fell and all my books disappeared with the last battery 
charge.
Then everyone got sick. We ran out of medicine, or we couldn't get the
medicine, or we didn't have the right kind of medicine. I don't quite 
know, I was very young. Not many of us survived
after all that. We did what we could to organize, but we didn't do it 
well
enough.
We tried to form into organized Trader Guilds,
those few of us who remained. I thought we were doing it to organize our people
into more effective units, each of which would cooperate for the betterment of
the whole. That isn't what happened. Now the most ruthless are in charge, hoarding the best resources for themselves, the
majority of people enslaved without a clue that things were once
better and could be again. But those two, they might be the answer. 
I
 raised Mark myself. I saw something heroic
in the boy when he put himself out there to protect the little girl he'd
 just met. I was hopeful he would be the one to turn things around. 
Maybe the task was too big for him,
maybe he just couldn't understand the importance. So far, he's been a 
minor
disappointment to me, but I still hope for him. 
Lissa's a different story. Her mother was a
beautiful woman who couldn't abide being locked within doors to keep her safe
from the Slavers. I helped her set up a secret Teaching Room where we could
discreetly send students to learn some of the things the Trader Guilds tried to
keep hidden from their slaves. She kept Lissa away from here, most of the time.
I don't know where - she'd never tell me. But she taught that girl a lot, much
more than what we have in the Teaching Room. And Lissa has her spirit. It will be hard to keep that girl down. I wish I could help, but dead men
can't interfere in the lives of the living. Now that Lissa's grown and making
her own choices, what can she accomplish, and will my Mark play a role? The Impact
Some
of the topics to be explored in this work of fiction:

Climate change
Sustainability
Alternative farming
     techniques
Innovation
Eco-punk (steampunk based on
     new power technologies)
Increased awareness of the
     needs of the Mississippi Delta region
By including these topics within an engaging work of
fiction, this story will be able to introduce more people to the concepts
surrounding climate change and inspire more pro-active action on the part of
its readers. With a strong female engineering-oriented protagonist, it will
also provide girls with a positive role model and encourage innovation among
readers.
*As
a professional technical writer, I am also interested to explore the
possibility of using crowd-funding to support academic-level research. How You Can Help


While
more than 50,000 words have been written toward the completion of this work,
the characters are operating without a stage. But there are just some things you can't learn from books or the internet. To give this story the
authenticity it needs, I need to conduct more in-depth, on-the-ground research
in the Mississippi Delta region where the story takes place. All funding raised
through this campaign will contribute to travel expenses and ground
accommodations as this research is being conducted (airfare, rental car, hotel,
food). 
Rewards
Any
contribution to the campaign will give you the option of joining the bi-monthly
e-mail update list. Bi-monthly emails will be sent out giving you updates of
progress on the story and invite you to make contributions as the story
progresses. At higher levels of contribution, you gain a vote on the final
title and cover design, guest appearances in the story, and free copies of the
finished work. At this time, only e-books are being considered (to reduce environmental
impact), but you will be among the first to know and receive if a print book
becomes available. 
 
Stretching Goals
If
I can raise as much as $4800, you will have
funded two full weeks of research on the ground as well as additional research
materials. The extra time would be helpful as I work to forge important
friendships from the area. Enabling me to purchase additional research
materials would mean you're also indirectly supporting other research covering
the main concepts explored within the book.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Follow</i> is about developing and cultivating healthy rhythms, practices, and habits that will help you become the person you were created to be and desire to be. We thrive by following (1) the rhythms we create and (2) the good plans God has for our life. This book will cover what rhythm is, how to create rhythm in specific areas, and how these principles apply in various stages of life.<br/><br/>My name is Joseph Tolonen, and I am the author of <i>Follow</i>. I wrote this book as a result of my experiences as a high school teacher. It broke my heart to see how heavy and weary my students (and sometimes colleagues) were. This strong feeling of discontent grew inside me, both personally and communally. It gave way to this feeling of “there has to be more in life,” and this book is about how we can create and find that “more” through the rhythms we develop and follow as we grow in our faith walk. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a much deeper sense of purpose and joy in your life. Through this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for developing and cultivating healthy rhythms and practices. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you take down what is standing in your way, creating in that space healthy rhythms that will help you thrive in your life, as well as help you deepen your faith walk.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about identifying what holds you back, how to create lasting change, and how to implement the principles of rhythm at various stages of life:</p>
<ul>
<li>When my younger brother and I were young, we used to play an iPhone game called <i>Pocket God</i>. As the “god” of our own island, it was fun being in control and deciding how we would use our power (whether for good or for evil). The biblical narrative calls us kings and queens, but we have a choice how to use our power. Ultimately, we were designed to follow God and order our lives after His plans and purposes. To create healthy rhythms, we first need to stop playing “pocket god” and relinquish control over our lives to God’s greater plans and order.</li>
<li>We are not in this journey alone. A good friend shared with me his journey to overcoming an addiction to pornography. A good strategy to developing and cultivating healthy rhythms is a mix of spiritual and practical. The spiritual side was submitting the addiction to God and asking for His help. Practically, this meant leaning into relationships, community, and accountability (specific rhythms that are discussed in the book). These relationships have helped spur him on as he continues to work on developing healthier rhythms and pursue freedom.</li>
<li>There are generally two types of rhythm changes, proactive and reactive. My pastor friend, Phil Kerlin, shared with me how we can be proactive about anticipating and preparing for changes such as getting married or having kids. On the other hand, something like a worldwide pandemic forces reactive changes. Especially in challenging times like these, having a good foundation of rhythm is important so that instead of being capsized by the storm, we can use it to our advantage.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are a young adult or young professional (although, the principles apply to any age demographic!). If you’re a parent, teacher, or someone who works a lot with younger people, this book will be valuable to you as you guide them. Those who like systems and getting things done (like me) will enjoy all the practical tips and systems that can be used and developed. If you’re unhappy with your life, stressed and overwhelmed all the time, and always feel like everything’s out of control, this is the book for you.<br/><br/><i>Follow</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to young adults/professionals and parents and teachers who are looking at creating healthy rhythms and habits and finding a deeper sense of purpose and fulfillment in life for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Follow</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction, a “success” story, and chapters 1-6. This part of the book is all about understanding what rhythm is, the science behind creating healthy habits, and addressing the spiritual importance of rhythm in life. While people tend to talk about “balance,” the concept of rhythm is superior due to its flexibility (whereas balance is usually static). Looking at the science behind the power of habit will help us use whatever life throws at us to our advantage and start building small habits that steer us in the right direction. Before rhythm can be created, a strong foundation needs to be built. This means being self-aware of what inhibits us from growing, tearing those strongholds down, and forming a vision of the person we want to become.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 7-12. The second part of the book discusses the specifics of developing a “rhythm of life.” It references something practiced by monks called the “rule of life.” We will look at specific rhythms that can be developed, including relationships and community, boundaries, rest-work relationship, worship and prayer, and service and hospitality. Each chapter will include some background on the specific rhythm being discussed, as well as practical ways to start practicing and integrating it into your life, including questions and charts you can fill out on your own. This part will be the most “nitty-gritty” of the book, as it focuses primarily on how each rhythm pertains to the current season of life you are in.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 </strong>contains chapters 13-16. The last part of the book focuses on how these above principles and rhythms can be integrated into various stages of life. These stages include: middle and high school, college, early career/young professionals, and mid-points (or looking to change). Each chapter will contain specific suggestions for each rhythm in part two, as well as experiences from those in the same stage of life. The book will end with the second half of the “success” story from the beginning, which will give you a picture of how much your life could change (for the better) as you learn to cultivate healthy rhythms and follow the good plans God has for your life.</p>

The second part of the book discusses the specifics of developing a “rhythm of life.” It references something practiced by monks called the “rule of life.” We will look at specific rhythms that can be developed, including relationships and community, boundaries, rest-work relationship, worship and prayer, and service and hospitality. Each chapter will include some background on the specific rhythm being discussed, as well as practical ways to start practicing and integrating it into your life, including questions and charts you can fill out on your own. This part will be the most “nitty-gritty” of the book, as it focuses primarily on how each rhythm pertains to the current season of life you are in.Part 3 contains chapters 13-16. The last part of the book focuses on how these above principles and rhythms can be integrated into various stages of life. These stages include: middle and high school, college, early career/young professionals, and mid-points (or looking to change). Each chapter will contain specific suggestions for each rhythm in part two, as well as experiences from those in the same stage of life. The book will end with the second half of the “success” story from the beginning, which will give you a picture of how much your life could change (for the better) as you learn to cultivate healthy rhythms and follow the good plans God has for your life.

<i>The Future of Palestine: True leaders accept diversity</i> is a non-fiction book that provides non-Palestinians with a background about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It also addresses Palestinians through focusing on learning about diversity in the Holy Land and on how to appreciate it based on theoretical readings of the Palestinian society. The end goal is to have a positive impact in one's community.<br/><br/>My name is Tamar Haddad, and I am the author of <i>The Future of Palestine: True Leaders Accept Diversity</i>. I hope that in reading this book you will discover that the conflict Palestinians encounter is not merely related to Israel. Despite Palestinians’ lack of mobility, water, electricity and control over their own land and air by the Israeli law, conflicts within arise everyday. Such issues occur towards Palestinians who are different from what is widely agreed to be the norm, and those who are considered the Other or minorities.<br/><br/>In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for social justice in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you accept people of different religion, race, gender, sexual orientation and class. Unfortunately, we live in a world submerged in a dark, gooey and filthy liquid that consists of prejudice towards people of other or even no religion, racism, misogyny, homophobia and capitalism. <br/><br/><i>The Future of Palestine</i> is your chance to accept and appreciate diversity through:<ul>
<li>engaging in theoretical readings like nationalism, the race theory, feminism, queer theory, marxism, post colonialism, psychoanalysis and Orientalism,</li>
<li>sharing stories of Palestinians who do not fit into the norm,</li>
<li>paying it forward and making a change in one’s own community.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are fed up with people dying everyday because they are not accepted, and you wish to make a difference about it. <br/><br/><i>The Future of Palestine </i>speaks to Palestinians and non-Palestinians who want to grapple with accepting diversity within Palestine and gaining knowledge about the Palestinian-Israel conflict in a new way.<br/><br/>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing Palestinian identity and trauma, the notion of religion, women, race, LGBT, and class will change us all for the better. </p>
<h3>The Book - <i>The Future of Palestine: True Leaders Accept Diversity </i>
</h3>
<p>A road map of the book <br/><br/><i>The Future of Palestine</i> is written in 3 main Parts:<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> introduces the history of Palestine and how Israel was formed, from an objective point of view. Moreover, it explains the shared collective trauma of Palestinians and the predicted loss of their identity. This part is mainly directed towards non-Palestinians and those who are interested in knowing more about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> dives into the stories of those Palestinians who are discriminated against within the Palestinian society for their religious beliefs, race, gender, sexual orientation or class. Theoretical criticism is applied to these stories. This section of the book targets Palestinians, especially those who want to eliminate all prejudices. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3 </strong>sheds light on possible advantages within the Palestinian community, and directs readers on how to make a change.

As an artist-run initiative to gather and care for historic printing presses, we will be combining this unique technology and one of the most notable stories ever published. Using historic craftsmanship in homage to the original edition from 1943 will result in a book truly like no other.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>THE PROCESS</strong></h3><p>Several legacy technologies and machines will be used, which date back to the early 20th century. Relying on equipment which predates computerized automation and demands both intuition and skill from the operator is our way of connecting with the author. Saint-Exupéry is today known for his books, but his true passion was the skies. While our presses do not take flight, we know of the struggle to control the machinery.</p><p>The text of the book will be cast line by line from molten lead using a Linotype typecasting machine. Once the workhorse of all printing houses, the Linotype is like a giant typewriter, that operates to a constant clicking of little brass matrices, each a mold for a single letter. One by one the matrices are assembled by key presses, formed into a line, cast into lead and then re-sorted back into their places. The intricate machinery behind this has fascinated enthusiasts then and now, and many would still argue the Linotype to be one of the finest examples of engineering.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567419809/hebhf81bbwqygwnuv5sd.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Illustrations will be initially digitized for clean-up and then etched onto metal plates with acid, utilizing a technology known as photozincography. This process dates back to the middle of the 19th century and was one of the earliest methods of producing exact printing plates from film.

As an artist-run initiative to gather and care for historic printing presses, we will be combining this unique technology and one of the most notable stories ever published. Using historic craftsmanship in homage to the original edition from 1943 will result in a book truly like no other. THE PROCESSSeveral legacy technologies and machines will be used, which date back to the early 20th century. Relying on equipment which predates computerized automation and demands both intuition and skill from the operator is our way of connecting with the author. Saint-Exupéry is today known for his books, but his true passion was the skies. While our presses do not take flight, we know of the struggle to control the machinery.The text of the book will be cast line by line from molten lead using a Linotype typecasting machine. Once the workhorse of all printing houses, the Linotype is like a giant typewriter, that operates to a constant clicking of little brass matrices, each a mold for a single letter. One by one the matrices are assembled by key presses, formed into a line, cast into lead and then re-sorted back into their places. The intricate machinery behind this has fascinated enthusiasts then and now, and many would still argue the Linotype to be one of the finest examples of engineering. Illustrations will be initially digitized for clean-up and then etched onto metal plates with acid, utilizing a technology known as photozincography. This process dates back to the middle of the 19th century and was one of the earliest methods of producing exact printing plates from film. The etched plates are nailed onto wooden blocks to raise them to the same height as the lead lines from the Linotype machine. The cast lines and metal plates will be assembled into pages in precise layout. Care has to be taken to place pages in the correct order for later folding, to calculate the margins and gutters. Neither millimeters nor inches are used for this job, as all layout units are instead based on the typographical units of points, picas or quads. The assembled pages, the printing forme, will be fed into a cylinder press, where a central steel cylinder will roll over the letters to create an impression on the paper. The sheer direct pressure imparted on the paper will leave characteristic embossing and marks that are witness to an imprecise technology. While in many ways inferior to modern offset or digital printing, letterpress has its own merits. Not only will the occasional defect be felt with your fingertips, one could also claim that the print is richer in intensity and therefore easier to read. While personal taste differs, letterpress printed texts have a distinctly different character from other technologies.  THE BOOKSWe offer the book in three variants with an added option of joining us for a private workshop and a chance to participate in the making of your own copy.Letterpress edition: a limited edition letterpress printed copy of the book, individually numbered and cloth bound, including a little prince on the front over and a four color dust jacket. Collector’s edition: the same printed edition, bound by hand using colorful thread, including marbled endpapers and a binders mark in addition to the other characteristics of letterpress printing. Exclusive gift edition: based on the collector’s edition, the exclusive gift edition will feature an extra title page with letterpress printed dedication. The text of the dedication can be up to 50 characters long using Latin script and will be typeset entirely by hand.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Tin House Summer Writer's Workshop is like the most amazing semester of Creative Fiction you could ever hope to take, complete with a rock star line up of instructors, all squished in to a week. They also put out one of the finest, regularaly anthologized literary journals, and operate a press which publishes the acclaimed ""Tin House New Voices"" series.</p>
<p>There were over 600 applicants this year and, based on the strength of my writing sample, I was one accepted. However, I wasn't a recipent of one of the eight scholarships. I could use a little help... </p>

The Arab spring for instance, documenting the revolution which took place in Egypt day by day.b. Cultural events, such as the Venice Film Festival, The Venice Art & Architecture Biennale, the G20 in Canada, The Cop21 in Paris, the international design week in Milan and many others.c. The Fashion weeks all around the world, ranging from Milan, Paris, Berlin to London, showing the backstage scenes and the shows of the most noteworthy and emerging brands.4) Social Media activity: With more than 26.000 likes on Facebook, we keep our followers updated everyday with new articles and all the other contents we have been creating.5) First issue activity: Positive Magazine issue 1 has been printed, distributed  and sold all around the world and has been recognized for the quality of images, the selection of articles and the stories produced in different fields.WHAT’S NEXT?Last year we challenged ourself with a new adventure and we decided to create something totally different in combination with all the other contents we have been producing in these 9 years.With the help of our international sponsors such as Parley for the Ocean and Crash baggage, and the support of our crowdfunders, we have been able to print the first issue of the magazine.Now We are ready to print our second paper issue which will be distributed and sold around Europe, New York City, Japan, South Korea and Australia, thanks to our international distributor EXPORT PRESS present among the best bookshops and newsagents.We will present the magazine in Venice the 30th of June during the event “L’Italia è di moda” (Italy is fashionable), organized by the Architecture, Design and Fashion University of Venice (IUAV).WHY WE NEED YOUR HELPWe have a magazine ready to be printed with original stories from all over the world, fashion editorials, interviews with both prominent and emerging actors, musicians, photographers, architects and so forth.What we need now is your contribution.To cover a part of the costs of printing and shipping of our second issue (and paying our talented crop of local freelancers and all-volunteer team) we will need to raise at least €2,000.Our first print issue will be released in July and it will be distributed in Europe, New York City and Australia, and also sold on our website.How to contribute?

<p>“We have heavy Siberian Black hair, long and wicked. We have Horrid Big eyes because there is something wrong with us. We have Purgatory Grey irises, though my pupils are perennially contracted inherited from my lulled, decaying father. We have the Wandering Arab skin stretched on brittle body. We have wistful hair above our Suffocated Blue Dry lips implying a smear of dirt. We have an arch shoving our lower back forward saying we are offering our little belly or our little butt but I think we are not. We have the Mongolian Purple aureoles besieging the Sudanese Purple nipples surmounting boyish bumps. Her cunt is concave, mine convex; hers suggests entry, mine irritation. Our mouth is wide and queer and lurid. I have one fang among my upper teeth. It is on the left. I tease it with my tongue. Our face is religiously pretty though the whole theme synthesized with our body exalts us to a thing profane.”</p>
<p>“A tinier girl than my present smallness I stretched on the bed my playful, scabby limbs I implored this god for a micro act for a micro girl. A very fair request if one knows what fair is.

But at times a financial setback can leave us just too ""close to the edge"".  Close to half of working Americans are eligible for financial helping hand ups from nonprofit programs—often your neighbor, maybe you!     Each year we Americans donate more than $40 billion to nonprofit programs earmarked to help those of us who need just a little bit of help to 'stay even' that month.  A Hand Up, not a handout ,..so someone working hard can have enough money for gas to get to work,  the roof over their head AND food on the table.   So why aren't the eligible applying?  Millions of folks believe they're ineligible because they work! Or because they have no kids, or are single.  Many don't know even programs exist.  There are over 130,000 nonprofits that lend a helping hand to those of us on thin ice' financially... lists and lists online of hundreds of programs offering almost anything a family needs.  So how does any individual or family find and apply to the right 25-30 programs?!Do you know what 250% of Federal Poverty Level means?     Neither do many millions of eligible Americans!  No book and very few websites provide much-needed guidance.  When my kids and I were homeless due to unpaid child support, I was a nonprofit grant writer...so I already knew where to look, how to apply.  But still I was sometimes confused by the process!  With this as a navigation tool,  today's 'middle class' (those earning appx. $12K-$52K a year) can find as many as 30 programs from among the thousands which specifically 'fit'  family needs, size, income level, accurately submit application paperwork.             Remember, these are Hand ups--not handouts. Not government assistance. These are dollars donated purposely to help others to get back up or to stay up on their feet...     When guided to find these dollars, eligible families can access $1,000s per person.  For example:  Counselors trained by The Ohio Benefit Bank have helped Ohio residents access an average of more than $4,500 per person.  Together we can distribute this powerful navigation tool! Pledge your support, OR simply Email the campaign URL to friends and family!We are relying on the passion and caring of people like you to spread the word. _________________________    Today's hungry working-poor are not the stark images we see of people living under bridges in cardboard boxes.  These are often your neighbors, co-workers...  The costs for two very basic needs—housing and driving to/from work—have risen greatly in recent years. But incomes have not!  So Americans have less income for ""wealth-building"" such as short- and long-term savings!  Good people working hard, yet barely financially getting by, unable to save, paycheck-to-paycheck. In these homes, a large car repair or brief family medical issue can change whether there's food in their frig—or not.    Why This Book is Needed More than Ever    In 1980 there were only a few hundred food banks; today there are over 50,000. The need is there—working people forced to line their pockets with toiletries from work or food from social events to keep clean and feed their hungry kids—just like I did.     This book is needed also because financially hurting families can't just 'push a button' to get the help they need!  Before each nonprofit can give away $200, $500, $1000, they must obtain proof of eligibility; they must follow rules—including some IRS rules!  And those of us who donate to the nonprofits want to know our dollars were used wisely! This HowTo book provides detailed instructions  to efficiently submit accurate applications the first time. Almost 1 in 3 kids goes to bed hungry some nights...like mine did (that's my son, who's now a young adult!) ...simply because their parents can't find the help that is out there.  My unique personal experience and professional expertise can guide parents to assistance for the sports teams, the tutoring, the summer camps that help grow successful adults. (Yes this book can help find and apply for free tutoring, low cost braces...and so much more!)  In this book I share every detail I learned, everything you need—so other kids can have a better, kinder childhood than mine did.  (Several are Exclusive Early Birds Rewards!)And IndieGoGo's Security Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology protects and secures your sensitive personal information!

My name is Frank M. Ahearn I am the author of How to Disappear & The Digital Hit Man.
 My books are considered the leading books in the
world of privacy and personal freedom. I work with victims of stalkers 
and individuals
who need help with unfortunate digital issues. I also travel the world 
sharing my ideas and thoughts about the future of privacy.
WHAT: How to Disappear From BIG BROTHER
I planned on publishing my new book How to Disappear From BIG BROTHER with a traditional publisher. However, after much thought
about the current state of privacy in the world I believe my book would be best
served if I write without any publisher interference and make it affordable to all. THE PLAN: To release How to Disappear From BIG BROTHER and make it affordable to all. I will release the book and download it at a standard retail price and after ninety days I will reduce the digital download to $0.99 and the softcover book for under $7.99. For eternity!WHY:Because
 privacy matters! If you know what NSA stands for you know we are losing
 our privacy quite rapidly. My new books teaches people how to be more 
private in a world where the government is violating our privacy. MORE:The

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Aquellas galletas de canela</strong> habla acerca del aprendizaje, del crecimiento personal, de la amistad y de la entrega a los demás.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Ágata es una chica sin demasiadas amistades. Su tía Amelia es, de hecho, su profesora y su única amiga. Con ella habla de literatura y de amores próximos y lejanos, y así se establece entre ellas una relación de amistad que crece cada vez más. En sus encuentros comentan extractos literarios de grandes autores. Estas referencias sirven como reflejo para ellas, que sufren las mismas dolencias y los mismos pesares que los héroes literarios universales caracterizados a lo largo de los siglos. De pronto, un día, Ágata decide aprender a tocar la vieja guitarra de su tía y todo cambia.</p>

<p>I ENCOURAGE YOU TO WATCH THE VIDEO PROVIDED OF LAST YEAR'S CONTESTANT PLATFORM SPEECHES. LISTEN TO WHAT WE, AS A COMMUNITY FIGHT FOR EVERYDAY.</p>
<p>My name is Jennifer Kumiyama. I am a former Ms. Wheelchair California for 2010 and now the State Coordinator for the Ms. Wheelchair California Foundation. In January I will be hosting my second state pageant to find Ms. Wheelchair California 2014 at The Hilton Hotel Long Beach.</p>
<p>My goal is to stand by The Ms. Wheelchair California Foundation's mission: to recognize and celebrate women of achievement who use wheelchairs. This pageant defies traditional pageants by focusing on contestants’ achievements, advocacy efforts, communication skills and presentation style. This unique organization provides the titleholder with the platform to advocate, educate and motivate the state government and public to view people with disabilities as “people first.” This is accomplished through having the titleholder serve on various municipal and state committees and commissions that develop policies for the disabled community. The titleholder also attends various events such as conferences, forums, parades, festivals, corporate awareness events and grade school and university empathy events across California.</p>
<p>This past year, Ms. Wheelchair California 2013 - Margarita Elizondo has continued the tradition of the title holders before her, including traveling to The Ms. Wheelchair America Pageant in Houston, Texas! She did very well and we are so proud of her. Little Miss Wheelchair California 2013 - Lourdes Mack has been very busy this year, motivating youth with disabilities all over California. Our ladies work very hard to empower the disability community!</p>
<p>My passion for doing this begins as far back as my early childhood. I've been in a wheelchair all of my life. I have limited mobility in all of my limbs, leaving me dependent on assistance for most or all of my daily living needs. I was faced with obstacles everydayand even kept in special education classes though it was ot necessary for me to be there. I missed out on a few field trips because school busses with lifts cost too much and there was no funding. My parents were my advocates, and it was difficult for them. It wasn't until The ADA was signed in 1990, that I learned my rights. I was 10 and I transferred myself into a regular education classroom. Growing up with those hardhips made me want to advocate for the rights of others like me - who might not have the ability to (literally) speak for themselves. I want to provide my community, the disability community, with Ms. Wheelchair California - someone who will continually strive to break attitudinal barriers and stigmas of our community. She will be our strong voice to remind societ that disability rights ARE civil rights.</p>
<p>I realize that in today's economic situation, giving money isn't something we can do freely. I'm asking that you consider making a donation - regardless of the amount. Every dollar helps. Please help me by contributing and by spreading the word about The 2014 Ms. Wheelchair California Leadership Forum and Pageant. Thank you all so much!</p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>En los ojos de Carmen</strong> hace justicia a varias generaciones de mujeres que sufrieron las consecuencias de la sociedad franquista: clasismo, machismo y supremacía católica...</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Carmen es una niña, después adolescente, más tarde joven mujer, que ha nacido a finales de los años cuarenta en una familia <i>bien </i>española que trata de darle todo lo mejor que ellos entienden pueden entregarle y enseñarle. A través de las distintas etapas de las edades de Carmen y, también, a través de sus ojos de mirada inocente, vemos sus condicionamientos y los de otras mujeres por haber nacido en aquella época. Conocemos la España del franquismo siempre desde sus ojos muy abiertos y curiosos que observan el entorno sin juzgarlo ni tampoco acabar de entenderlo. Eso sí, intentando siempre encontrarle un significado que nos va exponiendo desde un inocente y amable sentido del humor, que te hará reír con ganas muchas veces a lo largo de la lectura.</p>
<p>Y esto es lo que nos comenta Pilar Manso, filóloga clásica y actriz, acerca de <strong>En los ojos de Carmen</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Cuando <strong>Constanza Rúa</strong>, muy generosa, me permitió leer el manuscrito de su obra sucedió que me quedé fascinada y también reconocida en la mirada de la protagonista, limpia y, a su pesar, verazmente crítica. Los ojos de Carmen, abiertos y redondos, como un agujero negro que atrapa todo cuanto sucede en su entorno, son también los ojos de la niña o niño que todos hemos sido y que somos en alguna esquina del corazón. La inocencia de esa mirada infantil llega a ser devastadora desde su objetividad imparcial reflejando con un fino humor lleno de candor, las formas y las esencias de una sociedad rígida, estrecha, pacata, mezquina.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Partimos de 1950 para llegar a la década de los setenta creciendo con la protagonista, una niña de familia <i>bien </i>de provincias, imaginativa, sensible e inteligente; un espíritu libre al que los cambios y libertades sociales le alcanzan siempre con retraso. Retrato fidedigno (como sino lo pretendiera) de la sociedad española del franquismo con sus abrumadoras diferencias de clase, su sexismo, su machismo, su estrechez de miras, su catolicismo manipulador y mal entendido, su actitud represiva, sus miserias morales y sus déficits culturales y educativos. Carmen realiza su tránsito de niña a adulta en un momento adverso tanto para la mujer como para todos los seres sensibles y libres que se cuestionan con ojos limpios las injusticias y carencias de su tiempo.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">La población de personajes con los que la protagonista se encuentra desde su infancia hasta su juventud tienen todos su propia historia, su <i>mini-novela</i>, que Carmen, siempre curiosa y atenta, trata de desvelar para comprenderlos mejor.<strong> En los Ojos de Carmen</strong> es una historia sencilla narrada por una niña común que llega a su madurez tomando decisiones valientes y honestas que la convierten en un personaje singular.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>From morning to midnight, social media consumes and documents nearly every waking hour of our lives. Ten percent of Americans actually wake up to check their feeds again in the dead of night. With every post, tweet, snap, status and ‘gram, we’re building a detailed archive of not only our lives but the lives of our loved ones, too. An archive that may outlive us all.<br/><br/>What does happen to all of this information once we’re gone?<ul>
<li>Do you want your family picture from your beach trip to vanish from Facebook once you are gone?</li>
<li>Will that post on Instagram be how you are remembered by your great-granddaughter?</li>
<li>Will all of these posts be used to create a digital version of you in the future? One that can use all the information you have put online to predict answers you might give after you are gone?</li>
</ul>
<br/><i>Digital Remains</i> is a book that not only identifies the options you have with your online presence after you or a loved one dies but also shares stories and insights about new perspectives and options you didn’t know you NEED to know.<br/><br/>My name is J. Howard Harrington, and I’m a funeral director, embalmer, and author of <i>Digital Remains</i>. As a funeral director, I help others prepare and plan the legacy they’ll leave behind. I wrote this book because I realized that if the archive of one’s life has the potential to become someone’s legacy, we must prepare in ways we never had to before. End of life planning today is more than just an exploration of the new funeral options available, which I also address. It’s also an excavation of our detailed archives and an overhaul of our Digital Remains.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you’ll discover funeral options that truly are right for you, rather than be steered toward an option deemed “better” than others. In this book, I hope to impress upon you the importance of taking control of your Digital Remains — your entire life’s worth of data online — and the complications we’ll leave behind if we continue to ignore them. Then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool. A tool to help you discover what the choices that need to be made are. These choices focus on both your Physical Remains (including how we got here and what new options exist) as well as your Digital Remains (ranging from what to do with your Facebook page to who has the rights to your hologram).<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about firsthand experiences with loss and social media and insights about questions you have always wanted to know the answer to but never thought to ask:<ul>
<li>What are ashes and are they good for your garden?.</li>
<li>If newspapers vanish how will we hear about deaths in our community without the Obituary section?</li>
<li>What and how will all the information you have put online over your life be used once you are gone?</li>
<li>Who owns your Hologram after you are gone?</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>You will like this book if you are curious. You will love this book if you are exploring what you need to know before planning a funeral.<br/><br/><i>Digital Remains</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to Social Media Users and Forward Thinkers who are looking at Death, Dying and Remembrance in the Tech Generation for the first time.<br/><br/><strong>-Technology - Social Media - Death Notifications - Future Options - Holograms -  </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Book - <i>Digital Remains</i></strong></h3> The book is written in 4 Parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 - What should I say to someone who has lost a loved one? How realistic are TV shows like HBO’s series Six Feet Under? What is the makeup of cremated ashes and would they be beneficial to my garden? We dig into these and other perspectives on encountering death in the digital world and the physical world.<br/><br/>Part 2 - We delve deeper into how we hear about deaths of people that are close to us and those that we haven’t heard from for years. As the means by which we learn of deaths change, death notifications can come with added complications. What will change when physical newspapers near extinction, along with the obituaries sections we’ve grown accustomed to finding inside them? What lessons can we learn from the lives that came before us? And, now that our networks have moved online, how far do our connections really go? Find out who might actually be affected in a new way by news you share online.<br/><br/>Part 3 - In a technologically focused world, many aspects of our lives center around instant access and practicality. Useable technologies can be added to visible memorials, as though providing a digital connection to those we have lost. In this section, we discuss new technologies through the logic of selecting some options that have been used in the past or might be used in the future.<br/><br/>Part 4 - We offer a Social Media Clean Up Guide, providing site-by-site advice on what to do with a deceased person’s social media and email accounts, plus tips to help you plan ahead.<br/><br/><strong>-Facebook - Twitter - Instagram - Email - TikTok - SnapChat - WhatsApp - Twitter - Posts- </strong><br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>
<li>The Editor - with whom I’ll work to revise and publish my manuscript in July 2020</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for my Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this Summer.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I pre-sell <strong>100 copies</strong> of my book, I will <strong>publish Digital Remains.</strong><br/>When I pre-sell <strong>150 copies</strong> of my book, I will also <strong>publish an audiobook.</strong><br/>When I pre-sell <strong>200 copies</strong> of my book, I will <strong>publish a hardcover edition.</strong><br/>Additionally, I will be able to offer expended languages in both <strong>Spanish </strong>and <strong>Chinese Editions</strong>.</p>

They can be used to describe people for whom ""he"" or ""she"" are not a good fit, or to refer to a person, real or hypothetical, of unknown gender.</p><p>But - with some notable exceptions - they’re under-utilised in science fiction and fantasy - despite the fact that they’re necessary just to depict our world accurately, let alone the myriad worlds of the imagination. While some editors are welcoming, others are dismissive, meaning authors are taking a risk in writing these stories, and readers don’t see enough of them.</p><p>As the editor of Capricious magazine (and a non-binary person myself) I want to create a special issue of speculative stories which not only use gender diverse pronouns, but embrace them.

Rather than saying “Ryan picked up the book but Ryan decided it wasn’t the sort of thing Ryan enjoyed reading” you would more typically say “Ryan picked up the book but she decided it wasn’t the sort of thing she enjoyed reading”. She is the personal pronoun.</p><p>In English, the personal pronouns we’re most used to are he and she. Not only do these require the speaker to know the gender of the person they’re talking about, but they only really cover two genders.

A little broken, blue light flickered down to meet hir. Ze reached for it, watching it play over hir skin. It tickled. Lyuko giggled, tugging away reflexively – and the light came too. Ze could see the coral’s new growth clearly, now softly gleaming. Intrigued, Lyuko pulled again, and blue light blossomed within the bulb. Ze rolled it, spun it, and webbed the walls in soft blue lace. It was more pliant and responsive to hir touch than water alone had ever been.Kouso was surprised, but overjoyed: hir child, a sculptor not of currents, but of light. The colony had never seen the like.""- from ""Moments of Light"" by Toby MacNutt, published in Capricious Issue 2  Gender diverse pronouns - like the ""ze"" and ""hir"" used above, or singular they, or any of a number of possibilities - are an increasing part of many people's vocabulary. They can be used to describe people for whom ""he"" or ""she"" are not a good fit, or to refer to a person, real or hypothetical, of unknown gender.But - with some notable exceptions - they’re under-utilised in science fiction and fantasy - despite the fact that they’re necessary just to depict our world accurately, let alone the myriad worlds of the imagination. While some editors are welcoming, others are dismissive, meaning authors are taking a risk in writing these stories, and readers don’t see enough of them.As the editor of Capricious magazine (and a non-binary person myself) I want to create a special issue of speculative stories which not only use gender diverse pronouns, but embrace them. Stories with gender diverse characters, in worlds where gender is conceptualised in many different ways - or not at all.We’ve published two such stories: “The Need for Overwhelming Sensation” by Bogi Takács and “Moments of Light” by Toby MacNutt, both of which use multiple sets of gender diverse pronouns - and such pronoun usage is very welcome in every issue of Capricious. Now we want to specifically celebrate it and showcase the possibilities it allows.  Our main photo depicts a Capricious fuzzhog engaging in research into historical uses of singular they in literature. Want your own? Check out the rewards. Fuzziness garanteed, research capabilities may vary.Gender Diverse PronounsA pronoun - or, more specifically in this case, a personal pronoun, is a word you can use in place of someone’s name. Rather than saying “Ryan picked up the book but Ryan decided it wasn’t the sort of thing Ryan enjoyed reading” you would more typically say “Ryan picked up the book but she decided it wasn’t the sort of thing she enjoyed reading”. She is the personal pronoun.In English, the personal pronouns we’re most used to are he and she. Not only do these require the speaker to know the gender of the person they’re talking about, but they only really cover two genders. Humans don’t always fit in these boxes.Fortunately, there are a range of gender neutral pronouns  - and they’re not all modern inventions. They are used mainly to either refer to an individual for whom “he” or “she” isn’t appropriate (that individual might identify as non-binary or genderqueer) or for a hypothetical person whose gender is not established (“when you find out who the person in charge is, tell them I need to talk to them”).What's the difference between gender neutral and gender diverse pronouns? There’s significant overlap between the two, but I chose the ""gender diverse"" terminology for this project because we also welcome stories in which pronouns do signify specific a gender, but in different ways to he and she.So we’re looking for stories that use singular they, or xe, or e, or per or any one of many possibilities - including those of the authors' invention. We’re looking for stories that use culturally specific pronouns, or pronouns created by the author for a fictional world. We'd love to see stories that also address other ways in which languages are gendered, and stories with multiply-marginalised characters.

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Hello everyone,<br/><br/>Thank you very much for your time for reading and sharing this (yes, it will be awesome if you can share it even before you're done reading!). To start it off, my name is Joshua Kevin. I have <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuakevin"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuakevin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">more than a few years</a> of experience being in the tech ecosystem in Asia, generally, and in Indonesia, specifically. With half of that experience <a href=""http://www.techinasia.com/author/joshua"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">being a tech blogger</a>, I spent most of my time writing and reading tech blogs. With that in mind, I thought, why don't I hit two birds with one stone: I can help people while I do what I love to do.</p>
<p>This campaign or project is being made for people who are in the tech ecosystem in Asia, nor interested in the tech ecosystem in Asia, yet they are either unable to keep up with all the posts from tech blogs covering Asia or they are just too busy to do that. In this project, I will help you. How? I will curate the best and most important articles/posts from the tech blogs, and deliver it to your e-mail, <b>daily!</b> Again, this is <b>not</b> a substitute to your RSS reader, but I'd say - a compliment to that. <b>Plus</b>, I will cover some startups that haven't been covered by the tech blog so far in a different way. So, if you are a startup, e-mail me!<br/></p>
<p>Personally, this project is an experiment of trying out a crowdfunding service (my first) and to see how big is the demand of a curated newsletter plus additional voice from an individual. Although it is an experiment, any benefits that I will get from this project will go directly to funding my future startup that I'm building. In a way, you are a micro angel investor in my startup!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Back Is What You Get (WYBIWYG)<br/>
</h3>
<p>Our goal is to get <b>$2000</b> or at least <b>1,000 subscribers</b> to make this project a feasible one to do for me. Depending on how much you are backing me for, you will get this benefit:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1 - The very basic package, you will get a one month subscription to the newsletter, with an occasional tech-related ads.</li>
<li>$2 - Same one month subscription, but free of Ads.</li>
<li>$10 - Subscribe for one year (12 months) of the basic, and get $2 off! (with Ads)</li>
<li>$20 - 12 months of subscription with no ads.</li>
<li>$35 - 24 months of subscription with no ads.<br/>
</li>
<li>$50 - Get two years of subscription and a coffee with me.</li>
<li>$100 - Get two years of subscription, a coffee with me, and your name on the newsletter for the first year of the service.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those of you who wants to donate but don't have either Credit Card or PayPal, e-mail me: hello[at]joshuakev.in and we can talk about alternative solution.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Ultimate Goal<br/>
</h3>
<p>I believe that this project, if successful, will not benefit just me - personally - but also my future employees of the startup, my future customers or clients, or if we are being a bit dramatic, the whole world can get a little(emphasis here) bit better. So, with your help, this young-hopeful entrepreneur can make another step to the better side.</p>
<p>At the same time, I do promise that if, again, this project is running well by the time the deadline has ended. There will be more fun yet useful projects in the future like, maybe, e-books that will cover successful startups in Indonesia, or even larger than that. <br/></p>
<p>But, even after reading this you feel that you can't or won't contribute just yet, that is okay, but it will be very very very appreciated if you can share this on your social media accounts or e-mail this page to someone do you think will be interested or get benefit from.</p>

<p><b>El evento motivó a varias personas a probar la escalada sin importar las diferentes capacidades físicas, pero en Elvira motivó algo más. Después de ver que tenía facilidades para la escalada, que se notaban con solo verla mover en el muro, decidió continuar practicando el deporte y entrenarse con la meta de llegar a participar en el mundial de Paraescalada.</b></p>
<p> </p> </div> <div> <h3>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</h3> <p></p>

<p>Presenta más detalles:</p>
<ul>
<li>El financiamiento es exclusivamente para pagar los
     pasajes de mi entrenador y el mío así como también la estadía en Guijón,
     España. Cada pasaje tiene un valor de 1500 USD y la estadía, debido a
     utilizo una silla de ruedas para desplazarme el hotel accesible más
     cercano tiene un valor de 3200 USD. </li>
<li>Para mí es todo un desafío ya que nunca pensé que
     podría realizar un deporte debido a mi discapacidad. Cuando conocí al vice
     campeón en para escalada, Raphael Nishimura, quien tenia la misma
     discapacidad que yo, distonia generalizada, me subí al muro y escale y
     escale y me sentí libre, hoy en día soy una deportista, si se quiere se
     puede, yo escalo! y seré la primera deportista de para escalada que
     representara a chile.</li>
<li>Si no logro la meta total, los fondos irán al mundial
     de todas formas, ya que seguiré buscando auspicios para asistir, ya logre
     que me financiaran la inscripción ( 120.000CLP) el club andino alemán y el
     gimnasio el muro quienes me entrenan gratuitamente.</li>
<li>Si no logro, por tiempo, lo invertiré en mejorar mi músculos
     con un kinesiólogo para poder asistir al mundial del año siguiente en
     mejores condiciones, pero estoy dedicada totalmente en mejorar mi
     rendimiento.</li>
</ul><p><b>El
impacto</b></p>
<p>Si contribuyen con mi causa, ayudarán a demostrarle a mi país
que las personas con discapacidad si tenemos capacidades y así motivar a otras
personas para que por un lado en un futuro cercano no sea yo sola la que pueda
asistir sino un equipo conformado por diversas discapacidades y por otro lado,
levantar la imagen de ""discapacidad"" en la sociedad chilena.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anteriormente, practique el deporte de equitación,
     disciplina adiestramiento pero no pude competir porque no esta reconocido
     como un deporte paraolímpico. El caso de la para escalada es distinto
     porque toda una red de apoyo que construí con mi perseverancia y
     convicción y ya existen copas mundiales, pero sólo en Europa, Aún falta
     hacerlo a nivel Para sudamericano. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li><b>Riesgos y desafíos</b></li>
</ul><ul>
<li>En general, la discapacidad no encaja mucho en este
     deporte, pero las personas que me rodean poco a poco si dieron cuenta que
     discapacidad queda de lado al momento de escalar, mi capacidad de escalar
     anula mi discapacidad. Esto ayuda a que la gente sea mas inclusiva y que
     no tenga miedo de interactuar con personas con discapacidad en general.</li>
<li>He luchado por mis derechos toda mi vida, especialmente
     en el ámbito laboral, actualmente mi profesión es ser una deportista de
     alto rendimiento, no esta directamente relacionado con mis estudios de
     traducción, pero he descubierto capacidades que desconocía, eso es maravilloso
     y muy potente y además una inspiración para que otros luchen por sus
     sueños.</li>
<li>En 8 meses, a pesar de mi discapacidad he logrado el
     mismo avance que cualquier otro deportista, tanto así que la campeona
     chilena Sara Alwyn me ofreció ser mi entrenadora por que cree en mi
     perseverancia y habilidades.</li>
</ul><p><b>Otras
formas en las que puedes ayudar</b></p>
<p>Si no pueden colaborar con mi campaña, les pido que por
favor lo difundan, no sólo por mi, sino por todas las personas con o sin
discapacidad conozcan este deporte y se motiven, para que la sociedad chilena
en general se de cuenta de que centrándose en nuestras capacidades, y que somos
nosotros los que conocemos nuestros verdaderos límites. </p>
<p>Los
invito a utilizar la herramientas de Indiegogo, es un modo fácil  de
difundir proyectos de toda índole y sin tener que salir de la casa.</p>

Si no logro la meta total, los fondos irán al mundial
     de todas formas, ya que seguiré buscando auspicios para asistir, ya logre
     que me financiaran la inscripción ( 120.000CLP) el club andino alemán y el
     gimnasio el muro quienes me entrenan gratuitamente.
Si no logro, por tiempo, lo invertiré en mejorar mi músculos
     con un kinesiólogo para poder asistir al mundial del año siguiente en
     mejores condiciones, pero estoy dedicada totalmente en mejorar mi
     rendimiento.
El
impacto
Si contribuyen con mi causa, ayudarán a demostrarle a mi país
que las personas con discapacidad si tenemos capacidades y así motivar a otras
personas para que por un lado en un futuro cercano no sea yo sola la que pueda
asistir sino un equipo conformado por diversas discapacidades y por otro lado,
levantar la imagen de ""discapacidad"" en la sociedad chilena.

Anteriormente, practique el deporte de equitación,
     disciplina adiestramiento pero no pude competir porque no esta reconocido
     como un deporte paraolímpico. El caso de la para escalada es distinto
     porque toda una red de apoyo que construí con mi perseverancia y
     convicción y ya existen copas mundiales, pero sólo en Europa, Aún falta
     hacerlo a nivel Para sudamericano. 

Riesgos y desafíos

En general, la discapacidad no encaja mucho en este
     deporte, pero las personas que me rodean poco a poco si dieron cuenta que
     discapacidad queda de lado al momento de escalar, mi capacidad de escalar
     anula mi discapacidad. Esto ayuda a que la gente sea mas inclusiva y que
     no tenga miedo de interactuar con personas con discapacidad en general.
He luchado por mis derechos toda mi vida, especialmente
     en el ámbito laboral, actualmente mi profesión es ser una deportista de
     alto rendimiento, no esta directamente relacionado con mis estudios de
     traducción, pero he descubierto capacidades que desconocía, eso es maravilloso
     y muy potente y además una inspiración para que otros luchen por sus
     sueños.
En 8 meses, a pesar de mi discapacidad he logrado el
     mismo avance que cualquier otro deportista, tanto así que la campeona
     chilena Sara Alwyn me ofreció ser mi entrenadora por que cree en mi
     perseverancia y habilidades.
Otras
formas en las que puedes ayudar
Si no pueden colaborar con mi campaña, les pido que por
favor lo difundan, no sólo por mi, sino por todas las personas con o sin
discapacidad conozcan este deporte y se motiven, para que la sociedad chilena
en general se de cuenta de que centrándose en nuestras capacidades, y que somos
nosotros los que conocemos nuestros verdaderos límites.

</p><p>Let me start by telling you who I am. My name is “VC”
Angell. I am a 73-year-old disabled vet. Although I served in Vietnam, I am no
hero. I fell off a pile of logs on an obstacle course at Fort Sill, Oklahoma
which led to a back injury. They tell me it will eventually put me in a
wheelchair. The way things are going – I believe them! I know there are scammers out there, so below is a copy of one of my older VA IDs. I erased part of the barcode because I am told it tells too much. You can see under my picture that I have a service-connected disability. Isn't it a wonderful picture? I had just come out of an MRI machine  before it was taken and was not too happy as you can see  – Grin. <br/></p>

<p>The more important thing is I am a writer. I graduated
from the MFA program at Western Michigan University in 1992. I was one of three
accepted to the fiction program the year I joined them out of hundreds of
applicants. Approximately 12 years ago, I published a dystopian science-fiction
novel titled <i>The Last Holey Man</i>. The
title is a pun. I posted it on Smashwords as a freebie if you would like to see
a sample of my writing. I should warn you that I found it on an old hard drive,
and although it is the complete novel, it is likely to contain some typos.</p>
<p>Turning to the sales of <i>The Last Holey Man</i>, they were both surprising and disappointing.
The sales were in clusters across the country. I suspect that was due to
word-of-mouth and not my attempts at marketing. I do not think it was due to
the reviews because I was only aware of one slightly negative review. I have
come to the conclusion that I have no talent for marketing.</p>
<p>That lack of talent is the reason for using Indiegogo. I
need professional help in marketing my newest novel titled <i>Bringer of Justice</i>. It is the first in a series of fantasy novels I
am planning. The novel was published at the start of July, and I have spent the

<br/></div>","Let me start by telling you who I am. My name is “VC”
Angell. I am a 73-year-old disabled vet. Although I served in Vietnam, I am no
hero. I fell off a pile of logs on an obstacle course at Fort Sill, Oklahoma
which led to a back injury. They tell me it will eventually put me in a
wheelchair. The way things are going – I believe them! I know there are scammers out there, so below is a copy of one of my older VA IDs. I erased part of the barcode because I am told it tells too much. You can see under my picture that I have a service-connected disability. Isn't it a wonderful picture? I had just come out of an MRI machine  before it was taken and was not too happy as you can see  – Grin. 

The more important thing is I am a writer. I graduated
from the MFA program at Western Michigan University in 1992. I was one of three
accepted to the fiction program the year I joined them out of hundreds of
applicants. Approximately 12 years ago, I published a dystopian science-fiction
novel titled The Last Holey Man. The
title is a pun. I posted it on Smashwords as a freebie if you would like to see
a sample of my writing. I should warn you that I found it on an old hard drive,
and although it is the complete novel, it is likely to contain some typos.
Turning to the sales of The Last Holey Man, they were both surprising and disappointing.
The sales were in clusters across the country. I suspect that was due to
word-of-mouth and not my attempts at marketing. I do not think it was due to
the reviews because I was only aware of one slightly negative review. I have
come to the conclusion that I have no talent for marketing.
That lack of talent is the reason for using Indiegogo. I
need professional help in marketing my newest novel titled Bringer of Justice. It is the first in a series of fantasy novels I
am planning. The novel was published at the start of July, and I have spent the
last two months researching book marketing firms. The better marketing firms
seem to be much like gas stations – they match their competition’s prices! The better programs they offer last approximately a month and go down from there
depending on time frame and coverage. The price ranges from $4000 and down. I will
choose the best firm – as yet undecided – as the money I raise will support. If by chance the goal is exceeded, the promotion could continue beyond four weeks.
Now onto a bit about the
newest novel – Bringer of Justice. It
is available on Amazon. The cover of the novel is pictured above. The blurb that was created for it reads, “A one-way

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<br/><p>This contest is being organized by <a href=""http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Eses/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Susan Elliott Sim</a>, a professor of Informatics at University of California, Irvine. I am co-editing an <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/coderetrievalontheweb/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">academic book on recent research on helping programmers find and reuse source code on the web</a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It’s common to end academic books with a speculative chapter, and 
what would be more speculative than a science fiction short story? I 
invited Vernor Vinge to submit a story, because I think the future might
 be the programmer archeologists that appeared in his “Fire Upon the 
Deep” and “Deepness in the Sky.” Rather than writing software from 
scratch, people are taking pieces from existing systems and combining 
them. In this style of programming, knowing the archives is as important
 as the ability to put the pieces together.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Vinge declined. However, he did give his blessing for a <a href=""http://www.singularsource.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">short story contest</a>. So, here we are.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Why a contest?</h3>
<p>We could have just commissioned an author or paid for a short story by the word, but a contest would go further to grow the community of authors writing hard science fiction about future computer technology. The contest is open to everyone, both published and unpublished authors. There is no entry fee.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We will have a panel of judges, which further builds the community. We plan to have one published author and one aspiring author.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are raising funds for prizes to ensure that we receive a good number 
of high quality submissions. Writing fiction is a labor of love and 
usually doesn't pay the rent. As fans, we have the opportunity to 
support authors, which leads to the production of stories that we love.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Being a contest winner also helps an author to get noticed by an agent or big publishing company, which improves their chances of securing that important first contract.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need<br/>

<br/>Second Prize: $200
<br/>Third Prize: $100
<br/>Honorariums for judges: $600<br/><br/>Remainder to cover costs, such as bank fees and postage.<br/><br/>If we exceed our targets and get lots of submissions, we will publish an anthology of the short stories through an indie press, such as lulu.com.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>One City</strong></p>
<p> Las Vegas is thelargest city in Clark County and is home to most of the schools found within the Clark County School District (which is the fifth largest school district in the nation*). CCSD operates 357 schools within it’s borders making it responsible for over 308,000 students and over 37,000 staff members. Doesn’t seem like a big deal, until you realize Nevada is in last place for education in the United States. That’s where we hope to come in. We may not be able to reeducate the students and raise their reading scores but we are hoping to help start a conversation in the improving the situation our state and our city finds itself in.</p>
<p><strong>One Book</strong></p>
<p>We are starting with one book. In January 2013 we will be launching a book on Amazon’s Kindle. We will be opening a store to sell a book geared towards the 18-30 year old demographic. It’s simple. When someone purchases a copy of Letters from London all of the proceeds goes to purchasing a book for the classroom. Whether that book is part of a class set of books for a High School English class or part of a class library for a third grade class to choose from at silent reading time we will use the proceeds of the selling of our book to buy another book to give to a school to help change the life of a child.</p>
<p><strong>One Child</strong></p>
<p>Even if we ever just sell one book, it will help one child get a book they didn’t have before. Our hopes is just that, we want to at least change the life of one child by giving a book to them through their school. We want to give at least one child another chance to live in the shoes of someone else at least one time in their life. We hope to spark a light in one child to help equip them to want to change their world. If we only ever help one child we would call ourselves successful.</p>

<h3>Why this book?</h3>
Awareness. A funny thing happens when someone shares a thought, an idea, or anything for that matter. It triggers something within us that tunes us into the thought patterns and vibrations around the subject discussed. Over the past few years, I have shared with some close friends the pictures I’ve taken of hearts I notice everywhere. It tends to come up rather casually, and ends with me showing a few pictures that I have on my phone. After their initial skepticism of whether I photoshopped or alter the pictures in any way – which I do not – they find it rather peculiar. They leave with a sense of wonder. Inevitably I get the email, phone call, or text message telling me that they saw the most amazing heart in some random place shortly after. Perhaps in a water puddle on the way home from work, the rust mark of their gym locker, or a chip mark in the bark of a tree on a morning walk. Wherever it turns up, one thing is for sure; It triggers a sense of awareness. So, if the ideas we share end up igniting the dormant powers of perception, then why not share the idea of abundant love? That is my vision for this book.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Why help?</h3>
<p>Why not? As Gandhi said: ""be the change you wish to see in the world."" Well, we don't all have time to save the world as with magical powers like Superman, or batman, but we can make a difference by sharing the little bit of magic we see in our lives. This can be your way of being a part of something positive, fun, and magical.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>- We need: funding to make this happen. A dollar from a-thousand-and-one people is better than a thousand dollars from one person. </p>
<p>- You get: depending of the perks you pick, anything from our love and gratitude, to a book, art work, even your very own customized print run.</p>
<p>The majority of the money will go to place a bulk order so that the price per unit cost is low enough to sell for a reasonable price, in order to make the book available to as many people as possible so we can share the love. The rest will pay for editing, proofing, book cover design, shipping, storage, distribution, *this video*, etc. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The vision in my fantasy world is that this book will trigger the necessary awareness to tune people in to the amazing beauty our world has to offer, slowly allowing them to embody more and more of the magic we all have access to, but seldom harness. Then the movement has begun. A sort of butterfly effect. Hey, you can't sail across the ocean if the butterfly doesn't flap his little wings! Be my butterfly so we can sail this message of love across the seven seas :)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If finances are tight and you really can't spare a few dollars, I understand. However, you can still help by forwarding this to people you know. Or if you have any connections that you think may help get this book out there, anywhere, please let me know. Much love and gratitude!</p>

<p>To be honest, it has been a very challenging journey being the sole operator of my own publications. This is the first time that I am openly asking for outside help. I am very excited about this project because I am taking a different approach to my writing as Rising Depth will be a series of short Novellas offered at a reasonable price to help promote readership.   </p>
<p><strong>Rising Depth</strong> will be a crucial element in linking the previous stories within my series as well as helping to widen the field of African-American Sci-Fi/Afro-Futuristic Authors.

</div>
<div>
<p>Beyond being an interesting and intriguing piece of literary work, this project also represents the blossoming field of Afro-Futurism and Black Sci-Fi writers. A necessary field that will eventually serve the purpose to breathe new life into the already existing Sci-Fi genre as well as strengthening cultural identity for African-Americans and other descendants from Afrika abroad. Being that the world has rapidly become a global community, it is important for every culture to have an equal representation in it. </p>

<h3>A Book about Nursing:</h3>
<p>One thing I’ve never been quite sure about is whether the word “nursing” is reflexive. It sure feels like it is. Am I nursing my child, or is he nursing me? Who is comforting whom? Who is helping the other calm down, relax, and rest?</p>

<p>Nursing with my son has always gone both ways.  When he first latched on after his birth with me propped up in the hospital bed. While we spent long sun-lit afternoons resting side by side during his infancy. When together, we sought comforting breaks from the emotional highs and lows of toddlerhood,  </p>
<p>The word nursing is derived from the Latin word <i>nutrire,</i> which means ""to nourish, feed, foster, support, and preserve.” I learned along the way that the “preservation” is literal: through breastfeeding, my body can detect viruses that my baby has been exposed to so I can buffer his immune system with the perfect blend of antibodies in my milk. And that the longer he nurses, the lower my risk of breast cancer.</p>
<p>I had no idea before I became a mother how profoundly life-affirming, empowering, and nourishing the breastfeeding relationship could be, for both mother and child.  It inspired me to write <i>A Nursing Love Poem</i>, a rhyming children's book.  This sweet and colorful story is a celebration of the nursing relationship. It arose from poems I wrote and sentiments I felt over the first two years of my son's life.</p>

<p>I'm Michelle, Virginia native and mother of 2-year-old Liam. Thanks for taking a moment to check out my project. I am lucky to have tried many interesting things in my life so far. I've worked as a communicator for the federal government, gotten certified as a yoga teacher and wellness coach, become a mom, and gotten way too excited about Myers-Briggs types.</p>
<p>But one thing I've always wanted, for as long as I can remember, is to publish a book. From my preschool days, I would dictate imaginative stories to my mom, which she would dutifully copy down on scrap paper and help me staple together and illustrate. Each one, conveniently, was called ""Michelle's Book."" So you can imagine my excitement when many years later, inspiration has struck. And the first review is in: Liam can barely finish reading the test copy I printed before asking to nurse! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am thrilled to contribute to the small yet growing collection of children's books honoring and celebrating the gift of nursing. And, from what I've seen, <i>board</i> books on nursing are even harder to find. The set up and creation of a board book is expensive, which is why most children’s books about nursing are in picture book format.  Through this campaign, I plan to print <i>A Nursing Love Poem</i> as a fully-illustrated board book that is durable and easy to share with little ones.</p>
<p>I would love to share it with you and your family, too. This book would be a wonderful gift for you, a loved one, or other soon-to-be or new mothers in your life.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Costs of Campaign and Plan for Funding</h3>
<p>Self-published board books must be printed in bulk to make them the most economical. With the funding I raise from this campaign, I will prepare and place a bulk order of 500 books, as well as other goodies I’ll be giving away through this campaign. Here is the general cost breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Illustrations ($200)</li>
<li>Designs (~$100)</li>
<li>Order of 500 books (~$2500)</li>
<li>Publishing Costs / ISBNs / Barcode (~$350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other, to-be-determined costs include the production of the giveaway greeting cards, shipping, Indiegogo listing fee, and marketing of the book. Speaking of giveaways, in addition to the board book itself, I'm excited to give away unique items for different levels of sponsorship:</p>
<ul>
<li>$15.00 Printable Bookmark Set, featuring illustrations from the book</li>
<li>$20.00 <i>A Nursing Love Poem </i>digital E-book (+$15 Level)</li>
<li>$30.00 <i>A Nursing Love Poem </i>board book (physical copy)  (+$20 &amp; $15 Levels)</li>
<li>$50.00 <i>A Nursing Love Poem </i>board book (physical copy), signed and with a dedication to the recipient (+$20 &amp; $15 Levels)</li>
<li>$100.00 <i>A Nursing Love Poem </i>set of 8 Greeting Cards, featuring illustrations from the book (+$50, $20 &amp; $15 Levels)</li>

</ul>
<p>If you decide to join and fund my campaign I hope you’ll find, like I did, that the book is ultimately an expression of love, and a way to honor and celebrate the gift of nursing for each of us on this journey.</p>

<p>In addition to financial pledges, I would <i>love </i>if you could forward this link to even just one mother (or father, or auntie, or nana...) with whom you think this campaign would resonate. </p>

<h3>Through The Wilderness</h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to my campaign. Here's a bit about me and my story! </p>
<ul>
<li> My name is Libier Reynolds and I am a Mexican-American woman.  I am a wife to Doug and a mother to Haylee and Madelyn.  I have overcome a few years of healing from being sexually and emotionally abused and have found the freedom to be myself again. I found hope for my future and it has transformed my life. I have had the pleasure of writing a lifestyle blog for a couple of years sharing my heart, beauty and style tips with my readers. </li>
<li>I had the miraculous push to write a book last year in September and in three short months, I had written over 50,000 words all filled with the experience of coming out of self-hatred. An epidemic I find rampant in the lives of the many of the gorgeous and talented women I meet. God gave me favor to meet and have my manuscript read by the McDowells and it was confirmation that God wanted me to share my story with others. They suggested their old-time editor, Dave Bellis for the job to edit my book to be read in the clearest of ways. </li>
<li>I believe so much in my story because it's not just mine. It's God's story about redemption and love and mercy. It's about so many other gals too that are suffering silently just as I was. And I believe that God will be able to use my story to help sort out theirs! </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We need $10,000 to  Dave and Tom for the extensive editing and reworking of my story to give it linear structure. I believe that Dave and Tom have something to add to God's story within me! I know that they will take what I wrote and give it more value than I myself could've ever given on my own. I love that we all need each other and we are all important puzzle pieces fitting together beautifully to encourage each other in faith. </li>
<li>With your contribution, you will receive a copy of the manuscript before it actually publishes to the public!  Your name could be inside the manuscript with a gift of $200 or more! </li>
<li>If we happen to <strong>not</strong> reach the entire goal we will still move forward in the publishing of, Through The Wilderness, your gift will remain true to its first intention which is to get this book published and in the hands of people needing hope! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution is going to impact the lives of many who are in bondage to self-harm, abuse, mental illness:</p>
<ul>
<li>My book is my story and I don't hold back in talking about very difficult issues of addiction. I've overcome an addiction to pornography in specific and I believe that our world is hurting due to many men and women being addicted to this sad buffer to difficult emotions. And now it's infiltrating the lives of very young boys and girls. </li>
<li>I have taken heed from the bible and gotten help from many advisers, family, mentors like Joanne Cole from Capital Christian, Josh and Dottie McDowell, Rachelle Ditmore from, <a href=""http://cityofrefugesac.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">City</a><a href=""http://cityofrefugesac.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> of Refuge </a>and I believe that God's confirmation through my husband about my book has been a huge blessing. We are believing God for a miracle. </li>
<li>In the past, I've taken advice from business genius, Daniel Episcope and was able to successfully pull off a <a href=""https://www.libier.com/new-blog/2017/3/23/shop-our-closet-make-a-difference?rq=shop%20our%20closet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pop-up shop</a> that raised money for <a href=""http://www.theglassslipper.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Glass Slipper</a>. It was an idea at first but Daniels advise of concrete and even-at-times intimidating framework of goals and intentionality, helped me with executing the idea into action. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In the past, I've been known to take something and not finish. I've been known to have a lot of self-doubts. I am a new author so publishers wouldn't risk their name on mine. I've struggled with depression and anxiety.</p>
<ul>
<li>But you know who would take a risk on me or you? God! Because he has called us by our name. This book is a miracle just in the way of it having a solid identity, so I believe that while in my natural state I am not qualified, God qualifies me in his infinite love and strength. I believe that God can multiply the little I have and that he will get the glory in the end for this book or anything else I can do to add value to this world in my future! </li>
<li>I have many people in my life who are now keeping me accountable. I have a therapist that I see once a month. I go to different mentors and have accountability through my closest family and friends. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sometimes you just can't contribute, I totally understand that!  That doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can pray. That's ALWAYS one of my favorite things to ask for and to do for people. Prayer works! </li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word about this campaign if you know anyone that would be excited to hear about it! </li>

</p><p>To Whom It May Concern </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am reaching out to share a dream that I have. The time is ripe to speak up, reclaim my power and share something deeply personal. I have been through<i> the dark night of the soul </i>and I want to continue my healing through writing. If you are interested, I have a project I would like for you to be a part of. Your contribution and support matters to me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of you know that I was my yoga teacher’s assistant. Not everyone knows that I was sexually assaulted at the teacher training in Los Angeles. When I came forward there were mixed reactions to what happened.  It has been one of the hardest experiences that I have ever had to face and it has been very difficult to navigate. I have experienced every emotion under the <i>sun, moon and stars</i>— from complete suffering and a desire to end my life to the most immense gratitude that I am free, alive, and loved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don’t believe anger creates change. However, I know that it can be channeled into social awareness, growth and finally the faith that each of our lives has a greater purpose. Einstein said that one of the biggest decision we have to make is whether or not we believe that this is a <i>kind </i>universe. In all honesty it has taken a lot of digging to finally feel that we do live in a kind universe and that I can transform adversity into a conscious gift to the world. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In February of 2013 I stepped down from teaching the series that I dedicated 6 years of my life to. I walked away from the organization completely. As you would imagine this put me at a disadvantage economically. I moved back in with my mom and retreated from the world. I have spent my time getting training as a life coach, collaborating with other women, healing my body, and writing. <i>Writing has been my medicine. </i>It was very exciting when <i>elephant journal</i> recognized my work and published a few articles on their site. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to find my self again I came back to my <i>zazen</i> practice, and replaced my normal yoga routine with a dance-centered practice. With that being said I miss teaching. I had dreams to open my own studio. I have been asking myself very deep questions about what it means to be a teacher. I want to bring light to the shadow of sexual violence, sexual harassment, and misuse of power that has been plaguing our yoga community and our world. My tool is the written word. </p>
<p>
</p><p>With your help I want to self-publish a book. I am not interested in going to a publishing company, or telling my story in a magazine. I want my voice to come through as a very sacred offering. I do not wish to create an exposé on the perpetrator, recount litigious details or somehow revenge my honor. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want, is to create a beautiful offering from what has taken a lot of strength to endure. I want to know that I did my part to make the world a safer and more loving place for the children I intend to have. I want every generation after me to know that I did not let it crush my spirit or belief in yoga. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any donations are welcome. It could be as small as the price of a cup of coffee or as big as you feel compelled to offer. In participating you would be supporting me to <i>focus </i>while I think, heal, love and write my journey—the lessons I have learned,  the healing I have experienced, and the awareness I wish to bring to others. In gratitude for your support you will receive a published ebook <i>with a bonus chapter </i>on energy healing practices<i>, </i>and a personalized note from me as a blessing for harmony and joy in your life.  </p>
<p>
</p><p>In all of this, I hope to inspire courage. Cour-age is made up of the latin root, “cour” which means, <i>of the heart</i>. We, humans, are powerful beyond measure when we remember our innate capacity for love. Love is our strength to create change in our communities and world. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you! </p>

I have experienced every emotion under the sun, moon and stars— from complete suffering and a desire to end my life to the most immense gratitude that I am free, alive, and loved.

I don’t believe anger creates change. However, I know that it can be channeled into social awareness, growth and finally the faith that each of our lives has a greater purpose. Einstein said that one of the biggest decision we have to make is whether or not we believe that this is a kind universe. In all honesty it has taken a lot of digging to finally feel that we do live in a kind universe and that I can transform adversity into a conscious gift to the world. 

In February of 2013 I stepped down from teaching the series that I dedicated 6 years of my life to. I walked away from the organization completely. As you would imagine this put me at a disadvantage economically. I moved back in with my mom and retreated from the world. I have spent my time getting training as a life coach, collaborating with other women, healing my body, and writing. Writing has been my medicine. It was very exciting when elephant journal recognized my work and published a few articles on their site. 

In order to find my self again I came back to my zazen practice, and replaced my normal yoga routine with a dance-centered practice. With that being said I miss teaching. I had dreams to open my own studio. I have been asking myself very deep questions about what it means to be a teacher. I want to bring light to the shadow of sexual violence, sexual harassment, and misuse of power that has been plaguing our yoga community and our world. My tool is the written word. 

With your help I want to self-publish a book. I am not interested in going to a publishing company, or telling my story in a magazine. I want my voice to come through as a very sacred offering. I do not wish to create an exposé on the perpetrator, recount litigious details or somehow revenge my honor. 

All I want, is to create a beautiful offering from what has taken a lot of strength to endure. I want to know that I did my part to make the world a safer and more loving place for the children I intend to have. I want every generation after me to know that I did not let it crush my spirit or belief in yoga. 

Any donations are welcome. It could be as small as the price of a cup of coffee or as big as you feel compelled to offer. In participating you would be supporting me to focus while I think, heal, love and write my journey—the lessons I have learned,  the healing I have experienced, and the awareness I wish to bring to others. In gratitude for your support you will receive a published ebook with a bonus chapter on energy healing practices, and a personalized note from me as a blessing for harmony and joy in your life.  

In all of this, I hope to inspire courage. Cour-age is made up of the latin root, “cour” which means, of the heart. We, humans, are powerful beyond measure when we remember our innate capacity for love. Love is our strength to create change in our communities and world. 

Thank you!

<h2>Flak Magazine</h2>
<p>Flak is an arts publication founded by Michael McFadden, Paul Middendorf, and Elizabeth Rhodes. The three of us began to discuss Flak Magazine and the many forms it could take because we felt there was a space in Houston that wasn't being occupied. We wanted to create something representative of the city not only in its current, local form but in its impact on artists and creatives around the world. There's a vast network of people who are from this city, visited for fellowships/residencies, and/or generally been impacted by the Houston arts community. </p>
<p>Through Flak, we want to tap into that network and serve as a sort of repository or directory for those experiences. </p>
<h3>Issue 0</h3>
<p>The inaugural issue of Flak Magazine, Issue 0, is reflective of our own connections to Houston. We looked at some of the artists we first worked with when we connected with the arts here or who have been integral in our development and sought to showcase their growth, representing the current state of their work as well as where they've come from and where they're going. </p>
<p>The artists of Issue 0 are Ryan Hawk, Cody Ledvina, S Rodriguez, and Bret Shirley. While these artists don't paint a picture of Houston's arts community in its entirety, they represent a variety of aspects intermingling within: study, personal growth, departure, and return. Each artist presents a new work that illustrates the current state of their artistic practice.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Consider this an expanded presale of Issue 0. You can purchase the issue at our base level and receive a copy of it either at our launch event or by mail (perhaps even delivery if you're in Houston). We certainly appreciate anyone willing to throw down money to support our creative efforts!  </p>
<p>Please consider contributing at higher levels as a means to establish a more sustainable future for the publication. When you contribute at these levels, you'll receive the issue plus some excellent Flak merch. You can even be listed in the Issue as a supporter!</p>
<p>Truly, though, you'll be helping us in our efforts to keep Flak both affordable and equitable, ensuring that we pay participating artists and writers what they deserve! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As previously stated, your contribution helps us to expand what we are able to do with Flak. You keep Flak affordable, allowing for a lower threshold for access, but you also help us establish future endeavors, such as a Digital Artist Residency - a paid residency open to any artist with a digital practice (essentially anything that can be put on the Internet) and a real connection to the city of Houston. </p>

<p align=""justify"">    Salut. Mă numesc Marius Băraş, locuiesc în Constanţa şi sunt scriitor şi compozitor.<br/><br/>  În cadrul acestei campanii vă prezint “CÂNTECUL TÂNĂRULUI LUP”, primul volum din saga fantasy “CEL-CE-ADUCE-FANTOMELE”. Povestea se va întinde pe cel puţin 4 volume, intriga cărţii cerând o amplă descriere a evenimentelor şi a lumii astfel create. <br/><br/>   Deşi până acum am scris 3 volume de poezie şi povestiri science-fiction, acesta este romanul meu de debut. Cred însă cu tărie în ideea acestei cărţi şi sunt convins că va fi o saga bine primită de public dacă voi avea sprijinul vostru în această campanie. </p>

<p>   “ În Nordul Europei, cu multe mii de ani în urmă, un misterios bătrân războinic umblă din sat în sat în căutare de viitori ucenici. Sosirea lui într-o aşezare este însoţită de cele mai ciudate zvonuri.</p>
<p>    Un personaj neînţeles despre care oamenii vorbesc lucruri stranii, contradictorii. Şi asta deoarece criteriul lui de selecţie a viitorilor ucenici nu e forţa, sau abilitatea de a mânui arme, ci arta, pornirea de a fi artist, puterea de a vedea dincolo de aparenţe.</p>

<p align=""justify"">   Tinerii pe care-i alege sunt ba muzicanţi, ba pictori, dansatori sau poeţi. Fiindcă bătrânul ştie că lumea nu e doar ceea ce ochii arată şi cel care o priveşte doar cu ochii e pierdut pe vecie.

<p align=""center"">VĂ MULŢUMESC TUTUROR PENTRU SUSŢINERE. </p></div>","Salut. Mă numesc Marius Băraş, locuiesc în Constanţa şi sunt scriitor şi compozitor.  În cadrul acestei campanii vă prezint “CÂNTECUL TÂNĂRULUI LUP”, primul volum din saga fantasy “CEL-CE-ADUCE-FANTOMELE”. Povestea se va întinde pe cel puţin 4 volume, intriga cărţii cerând o amplă descriere a evenimentelor şi a lumii astfel create.    Deşi până acum am scris 3 volume de poezie şi povestiri science-fiction, acesta este romanul meu de debut. Cred însă cu tărie în ideea acestei cărţi şi sunt convins că va fi o saga bine primită de public dacă voi avea sprijinul vostru în această campanie. 

Despre ce este vorba?
   “ În Nordul Europei, cu multe mii de ani în urmă, un misterios bătrân războinic umblă din sat în sat în căutare de viitori ucenici. Sosirea lui într-o aşezare este însoţită de cele mai ciudate zvonuri.
    Un personaj neînţeles despre care oamenii vorbesc lucruri stranii, contradictorii. Şi asta deoarece criteriul lui de selecţie a viitorilor ucenici nu e forţa, sau abilitatea de a mânui arme, ci arta, pornirea de a fi artist, puterea de a vedea dincolo de aparenţe.
        
   Tinerii pe care-i alege sunt ba muzicanţi, ba pictori, dansatori sau poeţi. Fiindcă bătrânul ştie că lumea nu e doar ceea ce ochii arată şi cel care o priveşte doar cu ochii e pierdut pe vecie. Căci artistul are de-a face cu o întreagă lume invizibilă, având pregătite instincte care în ceilalţi oameni sunt adormite de-a binelea.
   O lupta surdă se dă între forţe misterioase, încă nerevelate, iar bătrânul războinic pregăteşte următoarea generaţie de războinici pentru a putea proteja oamenii. Căci fire invizibile leagă existenţele şi destinele acestora cu viziuni ucigătoare, coşmaruri tenebroase şi frici adânci, frici care ameninţă raţiunea însăşi şi echilibrul întregii lumi.” Aici pot fi citite primele 3 capitole ale cărţii:http://www.scribd.com/doc/181974830/CANTECUL-TAN%C4%82RULUI-LUP-Marius-B%C4%83ra%C5%9F-fragment-pdf

<p>Ronja Vieth got a Ph.D. in American Gothic Literature, but is also a passionate poet and has been writing poetry since she can remember.

<p>Nevertheless, Ronja rejoices in making her poetry accessible to the public; she not only organized poetry readings for local poets at the Lubbock First Friday Art Trails' galleries or Lubbock's coffee shops, but has read her work at national and international conferences and local charity events (you may find some of those on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/englobe.me"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook englobe.me</a>).

<p>Therefore, Ronja's campaign seeks to raise funds to allow her to 1) finish editing her poetry manuscript and 2) enter it in book competitions, because this is the best way to get your manuscript printed when you do not personally know a publisher - it is POETRY, after all! ;)</p>
<p>At this point she is editing her manuscript of 75 pages of completed poetry, looking for venues, and sending individual poems  to journals in order to gain future name recognition. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The goal is to send her manuscript to as many poetry book competitions as possible before their deadlines end, hopefully to between 10 and 25 publishers within the next three months. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In order to do that, she needs funds to support herself in the process and enter those competitions, all of which require a substantial reading fee of around $25. </span></p>
<p>Ronja's manuscript is unique, however. As a South-African born German writing in English, her background makes her as interesting as the story she tells with her poems.

Anyone stressed out there?  Want to use a little of what's left of your fiat money to get some satisfaction? 

Whack The Wax breakable heads are made from a thin shell of wax and designed to smash dramatically.  Wax is non-toxic and won't get any sharp edges.

Whack The Wax breakable heads has over 20 years of history.  While particularly frustrated by my employer one day (that's another story) it seemed to me, designing an object to safely release that frustration would be handy.  Several materials and designs were tried before wax and head shaped were selected.  The original Whack The Wax beakable head was designed to be androgynous.  Potentially made up by the user to resemble who/what they want.  

Later, investors approached me to produce a Saddam Hussein version.  I have a lot of stories to tell from this version.  Meeting David Letterman is one story.  Meeting the owner of Slinky and other big time marketers like Dr. Fad.

The Saddam Hussein version was available in at least one US Nationwide chain.  Our biggest customer at the time Hills Department Stores, which went bankrupt (and that's another story)

The Tonite Show with Johnny Carson featured the Saddam version on one of his Christmas toy bits.  (He also included it in another bit, but as a prop.)

Barely surviving Hill's Bankruptcy we continued to produce various versions like Boss, Bully, Salesman, Ex-Husband/Wife but did not get new funding and national media again until doing the Brian Mulroney (past Prime Minister of Canada)  This version made front page of the national paper and Mulroney quit not long after.  We enjoyed all types of radio and television interest for the duration.

The media blitz did not translate into dollars.  Whack The Wax became a memory for many years.  

About 18 months ago, a new investor approached me to produce the Osama version.  After producing the new version, the plan was to produce several YouTube videos then start the press releases.  Several videos were produced, showing a steady improvement in video skills (in my opinion.)  Just about the time we were preparing to do our first press releases, we heard the news about Osama.  That put an end to that.

Having such a long history means that I am getting old.  At this point, I'm not thinking of riches but just of promoting my idea and having fun.  

This campaign is for flexible funding towards a Barack Obama version of Whack The Wax breakable heads.  It is an urgent campaign since it is related to current events.  

I'm asking for your help raising $12,523.  

The first $5,500 goes to the artist to produce an original high quality sculpture of the subject.  
The next $1,500 will provide 3 hyrdrostone master copies to be used for mold making and one master mold made from rubber with fibreglass backing.  
$1,200 will go towards the high quality, high temperature wax we use for the first run of heads.
$1,000 will provide the first run of plastic display boxes.
$800 will go towards shipping containers.
The last $2523 will be reserved for costs to run the campaign (Indiegogo fees), paypal fees, shipping costs and any other costs.

If the money is pledged to this campaign, I promise to produce the new version (Barack Obama) Whack The Wax breakable heads as quickly as possible.  Immediately upon receiving the mold, a first run of 100 heads will be produced.  All heads from this run will be used for videos and other promotions.  Heads used for videos will be remelted into new heads.  Providing an inexhaustible supply for videos.  

Videos will continue to be released on a regular basis until the version becomes obsolete.  All videos will attempt to demonstrate using the Barack Obama version Whack The Wax breakable head to relieve stress.  In most cases, I will attempt to use comedy.  To get an idea of the type of ideas I have used in the past, you can review any of the Osama videos posted on the WhackTheWax YouTube channel.  I admit my early videos really suck but I think I got better.  Some of the early videos on the channel did not include make-up (color) added to the head.  I had forgotten that all those years ago, we decided it was necessary to color the heads.  Custom color will be added to the Barack version as appropriate while of course starting with a flesh tone wax base.

Heads would be available for purchase at some time but only as they become available and only by request.  This is not an attempt to make money.  The more money invested in the version when it becomes obsolete, the more that is lost (speaking from experience.)  Estimated cost for a Barack Obama version Whack The Wax breakable head complete with display box, insert and custom shipping packaging will be between $10 - $15 plus shipping.  If no heads are sold but we have lots of fun (and maybe some more media for my idea) sobeit.

Let's do it!

If you can't contribute financially, you can by sharing this campaign.

Thank you.</div>","Whack The Wax breakable heads provide stress relief.

Having such a long history means that I am getting old.  At this point, I'm not thinking of riches but just of promoting my idea and having fun.  

This campaign is for flexible funding towards a Barack Obama version of Whack The Wax breakable heads.  It is an urgent campaign since it is related to current events.  

I'm asking for your help raising $12,523.  

The first $5,500 goes to the artist to produce an original high quality sculpture of the subject.  
The next $1,500 will provide 3 hyrdrostone master copies to be used for mold making and one master mold made from rubber with fibreglass backing.  
$1,200 will go towards the high quality, high temperature wax we use for the first run of heads.
$1,000 will provide the first run of plastic display boxes.
$800 will go towards shipping containers.
The last $2523 will be reserved for costs to run the campaign (Indiegogo fees), paypal fees, shipping costs and any other costs.

If the money is pledged to this campaign, I promise to produce the new version (Barack Obama) Whack The Wax breakable heads as quickly as possible.  Immediately upon receiving the mold, a first run of 100 heads will be produced.  All heads from this run will be used for videos and other promotions.  Heads used for videos will be remelted into new heads.  Providing an inexhaustible supply for videos.  

Videos will continue to be released on a regular basis until the version becomes obsolete.  All videos will attempt to demonstrate using the Barack Obama version Whack The Wax breakable head to relieve stress.  In most cases, I will attempt to use comedy.  To get an idea of the type of ideas I have used in the past, you can review any of the Osama videos posted on the WhackTheWax YouTube channel.  I admit my early videos really suck but I think I got better.  Some of the early videos on the channel did not include make-up (color) added to the head.  I had forgotten that all those years ago, we decided it was necessary to color the heads.  Custom color will be added to the Barack version as appropriate while of course starting with a flesh tone wax base.

Heads would be available for purchase at some time but only as they become available and only by request.  This is not an attempt to make money.  The more money invested in the version when it becomes obsolete, the more that is lost (speaking from experience.)  Estimated cost for a Barack Obama version Whack The Wax breakable head complete with display box, insert and custom shipping packaging will be between $10 - $15 plus shipping.  If no heads are sold but we have lots of fun (and maybe some more media for my idea) sobeit.

Let's do it!

<h3>The What</h3>
<p><i>Athena Leonidas lives a simple life in the countryside, far from the crowds and decadence of the city of Achillea. The daughter of a retired general, she has the status and freedom to pursue her passion for inventions and devices, and she doesn’t care if people think she is strange.</i></p>
<p><i>But then comes a day when the sky goes dark. Black warships descend like the night, capturing the city in the name of the legendary Tyrant, and when Athena’s father returns to Achillea to help defend it, he vanishes.</i></p>
<p><i>Athena travels to the city for news of her father, only to find him imprisoned and sentenced to die with the leaders of the resistance. Seeking his release, she confronts the terrible Beast – the monstrous minion of the Tyrant who led the attack and now controls the kingdom. He offers her a bargain: if she will be his slave, her father will be spared. Desperate, she agrees.</i></p>
<p><i>Fitted with a strange collar to make her obedient, she is subjected to the animalistic lusts of the conqueror. Yet, save for the collar, she is not restrained, and while she debases herself at his command, she manages to slip away to save those targeted for arrest and death. She masks her face and names herself the Rose as she fights the occupation with sword, pistol, and all her formidable intellect.</i></p>
<p><i>But time is running out. The Tyrant himself will soon arrive to inspect his new conquest, and when that day comes the streets will run with blood. Athena must find a way to free her country from the yoke of tyranny. She must find a way to kill the Beast.</i></p>
<p><i>But Athena has discovered something she never expected: within the monster is the heart of a man. She alone sees the humanity hidden beneath horns and claws. What does she feel for him? What does he feel for her? What will happen when the Tyrant arrives, and all must be laid bare and fought for—won or lost?</i></p>

It's impossible for me to believe that she is the same creature I felt stirring under my heart just a year ago.</p><p>She blew out her candles. It was cold, and the smoke from the small extinguished flame mixed with our breath at her small outdoor party. She wiped frosting in her hair, pink and blue mixing with her own baby yellow, the color of straw. Soft, like feathers.</p><p>The leaves are turning red and yellow. We scoop up great bunches of them and throw them into the air, watch them rain down, twirling. Magda is just beginning to walk. She holds both of my hands tight, arms up, like she's balanced on a tightrope. Sometimes she lets go. She is brave.</p><p>She likes to ride on Ronin's shoulders, tiny hands wrapped in his hair. She laughs and points, notices the birds in the trees and the geese overhead. Sings to the Owls at dusk. Hoo-hoo. Hoo-hoo. Her first words are bird calls. It seems fitting somehow. Small winged things able to brush the sky.</p><p>We take her walking by  the creek near our house, under the big Sycamores with their camouflage bark, limbs stretched high into blue, blue sky. We take off our shoes and socks and dip our feet in, making the most of these last sunny days while it's still a little bit warm.</p><p>The water is cold and Magda squeals. She bends down and wants to drink it, and we have to tell her again and again, it's yuck, poison, will surely make her sick. We stick out our tongues and she laughs, thinking it's a game. She is obviously expecting to drink the water here in this beautiful world, our spinning blue-green planet.  I don't know what to tell her. I also, cannot understand.</p><p>How people could have broken something</p><p>that was never theirs to break?</p><p>Magda is 12 months old.</p><p>******************************************************************</p><p>Magda was born in the fall.</p><p>On the autumnal equinox. On the day when dark is equal to light. During the in-between, when the dazzle of summer is just giving way to decay.</p><p>I dreamed of horses while pregnant. And the great redwood forests along the Pacific coast. Stallions and mares, Wild and free, running in herds through the open plains, clouds of dust filling the sky. And the giant limbs of the Sequoias, soft, mossy ground, the huge trees towering high above me.</p><p>That morning the sky rose pink over the blazing blooms of Jerusalem Artichokes that filled the yard, making  a golden forest that you could not see around, or walk through. We were safe there, hidden from view, tucked away with the Goldfinches and the Warblers, singing their sweet songs.</p><p>She was born like a prayer, with me on my knees at the foot of our small bed, clutching Ronin like a wild thing caged as our baby struggled to break free.</p><p>Our cries came together, my last and her first, an ancient howling that shook the walls and spoke of shifting bones and watery worlds. My last labor wail a final gift of life.</p><p>For her.</p><p>Pink lipped and rosy cheeked,</p><p>They laid her on my belly and wrapped us together in blankets, a warm reception for weary travelers. We rested, heads on Ronin's chest, and she ate, the first sucks soft, like the tickle of small and colorful wings.</p><p>Fluttering.</p><p>************************************************************</p><p>Dear Ronin,</p><p>Before I knew you, I already loved you.</p><p>And when I heard your name, I recognized it,</p><p>Like an ancient memory written in my bones.</p><p>*************************************************</p><br/><br/><h3>

</h3><br/><br/><p>The bees are dead. </p><p>We opened the hive to check on them one last time before the killing frost and they were already gone, curled and still on the bottom of the hive, and the ground around our feet, their small home eerie without the constant crawling movement of many. Complete collapse.</p><p>Ronin gently helped me gather up handfuls of them while Magda played by her swingset, making noise with some toys on a blue blanket on the ground. We buried the bodies in the garden, next to the small pear tree, already bare and waiting for spring.</p><p>The squirrels are building their nests. They're quick, and they work hard, carrying mouth full after mouth full of red and yellow leaves up the trunk to the highest branches of the Old Spruce tree at the edge of the yard. The day we buried the bees, we forgot Magda's fuzzy, blue blanket in the yard. Yesterday I picked it up to bring it back inside and noticed little holes where they must have chewed with sharp teeth, stealing downy strands for the center of their cozy nests. I smiled, thinking of the small, furry body nestled in soft cotton and dreamy sky blue, scented sweet, like Magda. I left the blanket where it was.</p><p>Magda and I watch them, through the big picture windows, in the morning over breakfast, eating bacon and eggs, or oatmeal and bananas. Last year, they devoured most of the corn out of the garden and drove Ronin crazy. This year, the stray neighborhood cat kept them at bay, a large orange Tom with long whiskers and green eyes. Sometimes we leave him treats, tuna fish and sardines, chicken and beef, our leftovers from dinner and lunch. Gourmet table scraps for a visitor acquainted with the streets. A small offering of thanks. For protection.</p><p>Magda is cutting teeth. For many months now she's had just the two little chiclet ones on the bottom. Chompers we call them. But now the others are coming in all at once and it bothers her some days. We give her chamomile, and oat straw, lemon balm tea sweetened with golden honey, precious drops we collected from the bees last year, when they still buzzed with life. She nurses more.</p><p> I bought cow's milk, raw, from the farm down the road. She was with me, and we marveled at the large animals, watched them eating, one slow mouthful after the other. I showed her where the milk came from and she laughed. Smooth, pink udders, nearly brushing the floor. But she won't drink it, not from a bottle, and not even warm with cinnamon.</p><p> We still have time. We still have time together.  And, I tell myself,  she'll be much older by then, won't really need milk to survive. And it will be hard to get I'd think, afterwards. But still I worry. So hard and so often that I think my heart will break.</p><p>Magda is 13 months old</p><p>******************************************************</p><p>Ronin's dark curls and crinkly eyes were still years off when I agreed to The Plan. He didn't exist for me yet, that cold night I pressed my warm hands palm to palm with the others in a show of truth, honesty and commitment. A small and simple gesture to seal our fate.</p><p>The night I wiped my salty tears from my cheeks and felt my heart pounding it's support.</p><p>That was the only time I've cried.</p><p>Things felt very clear to me then, before my edges were softened by love.</p><p>Blurred.</p><p>***********************************************************************</p><p>Dear Ronin,</p><p>I should have been more careful.</p><p>Should not have let your rough hands knead the kinks out of my neck, or caress my face with the gentlest touch. Should not have let you point to the stars and talk about space, the endless size of the universe, the intricate process of birthing planets.</p><p>I should not have let you kiss me with soft lips, or hold me close and whisper in my ear, or unbutton my pants with careful hands.</p><p>I should not have let you say I love you.</p><p>I could have stopped you. Could have run the other way, acted cool, aloof.</p><p>And that's why you'll hate me. When it's all said and done. Because this could have been avoided, all the pain, all the heartache, the broken promises, the lies.</p><p>So many secrets, parts of my life you've never known. Letters, written in code, slipped into the hands of black-clad couriers, in the shadows near the edge of the street lamps.</p><p>Phone calls. From seedy payphones and throw away cells.</p><p>Briefcases, duffel bags. The workshop in the basement of the empty house. I saw the questions in your eyes, the confusion. I tried to kiss it away, to joke, and shower you with love. But still you must have wondered. The guilt so heavy I covered all our mirrors in our house to avoid the look in my own eyes.</p><p>But that all stopped years ago, when The Plan moved from planning stage to waiting. Long before Magda was born. Even before I peed on the stick, 2 little lines the only sign of new life within.</p><p>Did I make a mistake? In the heat of the moment, wrapped in your embrace, did I miss my own body's small signals, signs of fertility? Or did I choose not to notice, chose to ignore the possibility of conception that night and instead buried my face in your neck?</p><p>Because I wanted a baby. The thing we never talked about. my longing. Oh we discussed it many times, how an earth in collapse was no place to raise a child. How the air, and , water, and soil were poisoned, in no shape to support new life. But I ached to be a mom, To watch my flat belly swell, to feel my breasts grow heavy with milk. To make a family with you.</p><p>Was that a mistake? Magda is a gift, to both of us. She lights up the world. Was it wrong to want that? To bring her here?</p><p>Knowing what I've known all along?</p><p>I've been careful, your safety has always been my number one concern.

Any and all help is appreciated. The ImpactYour contribution will mean the difference of helping this story and other anti-civilization titles see the light of day or not. In our technologically soaked and social network obsessed society, print is a fading form, yet it remains the means by which we can connect without an internet connection and this book is available at those times when someone needs it the most: around a campfire, when the lights are off, walking in the forest, sitting at your sit spot, or just seeking solace in a corner of the world away from machines.      It is important to keep this book and others like it as something physical. Something worth discussing. Something worth soaking in and letting yourself go into it. Something worth feeling.Other Ways You Can HelpOf course we understand that money isn't the most accessible of skills or assets out there. But please help us spread the word.

An excerpt from liminal: (please note this is still in draft form)
liminala novellaby Natasha Alvarez**********************************************PrologueThe winter before everything changed I was lost.I'd descend the 25 wooden steps to the basement only to stand vaguely, hands empty, gazing, eyes blurred, at the boxes of forgotten belongings. Outdated sweaters, old magazines, baby toys too precious and memory soaked to part with. Pieces of my life, folded and stacked, put away, smelling vaguely of sage and lavender. Scents to keep the moths away, with their soft and papery wings.Or I'd walk to the mailbox and open the small door, just to look inside, needing to see something empty. Cobwebs in the back, silvery threads, tiny eyes. A look at the lives of those accustomed to living in darkness.I think my heart already knew what my brain refused to acceptAnd maybe it was better that way, really.Less painful.Hazy.September We celebrated Magda's 1st birthday today. It's impossible for me to believe that she is the same creature I felt stirring under my heart just a year ago.She blew out her candles. It was cold, and the smoke from the small extinguished flame mixed with our breath at her small outdoor party. She wiped frosting in her hair, pink and blue mixing with her own baby yellow, the color of straw. Soft, like feathers.The leaves are turning red and yellow. We scoop up great bunches of them and throw them into the air, watch them rain down, twirling. Magda is just beginning to walk. She holds both of my hands tight, arms up, like she's balanced on a tightrope. Sometimes she lets go. She is brave.She likes to ride on Ronin's shoulders, tiny hands wrapped in his hair. She laughs and points, notices the birds in the trees and the geese overhead. Sings to the Owls at dusk. Hoo-hoo. Hoo-hoo. Her first words are bird calls. It seems fitting somehow. Small winged things able to brush the sky.We take her walking by  the creek near our house, under the big Sycamores with their camouflage bark, limbs stretched high into blue, blue sky. We take off our shoes and socks and dip our feet in, making the most of these last sunny days while it's still a little bit warm.The water is cold and Magda squeals. She bends down and wants to drink it, and we have to tell her again and again, it's yuck, poison, will surely make her sick. We stick out our tongues and she laughs, thinking it's a game. She is obviously expecting to drink the water here in this beautiful world, our spinning blue-green planet.  I don't know what to tell her. I also, cannot understand.How people could have broken somethingthat was never theirs to break?Magda is 12 months old.******************************************************************Magda was born in the fall.On the autumnal equinox. On the day when dark is equal to light. During the in-between, when the dazzle of summer is just giving way to decay.I dreamed of horses while pregnant. And the great redwood forests along the Pacific coast. Stallions and mares, Wild and free, running in herds through the open plains, clouds of dust filling the sky. And the giant limbs of the Sequoias, soft, mossy ground, the huge trees towering high above me.That morning the sky rose pink over the blazing blooms of Jerusalem Artichokes that filled the yard, making  a golden forest that you could not see around, or walk through. We were safe there, hidden from view, tucked away with the Goldfinches and the Warblers, singing their sweet songs.She was born like a prayer, with me on my knees at the foot of our small bed, clutching Ronin like a wild thing caged as our baby struggled to break free.Our cries came together, my last and her first, an ancient howling that shook the walls and spoke of shifting bones and watery worlds. My last labor wail a final gift of life.For her.Pink lipped and rosy cheeked,They laid her on my belly and wrapped us together in blankets, a warm reception for weary travelers. We rested, heads on Ronin's chest, and she ate, the first sucks soft, like the tickle of small and colorful wings.Fluttering.************************************************************Dear Ronin,Before I knew you, I already loved you.And when I heard your name, I recognized it,Like an ancient memory written in my bones.*************************************************
October
The bees are dead. We opened the hive to check on them one last time before the killing frost and they were already gone, curled and still on the bottom of the hive, and the ground around our feet, their small home eerie without the constant crawling movement of many. Complete collapse.Ronin gently helped me gather up handfuls of them while Magda played by her swingset, making noise with some toys on a blue blanket on the ground. We buried the bodies in the garden, next to the small pear tree, already bare and waiting for spring.The squirrels are building their nests. They're quick, and they work hard, carrying mouth full after mouth full of red and yellow leaves up the trunk to the highest branches of the Old Spruce tree at the edge of the yard. The day we buried the bees, we forgot Magda's fuzzy, blue blanket in the yard. Yesterday I picked it up to bring it back inside and noticed little holes where they must have chewed with sharp teeth, stealing downy strands for the center of their cozy nests. I smiled, thinking of the small, furry body nestled in soft cotton and dreamy sky blue, scented sweet, like Magda. I left the blanket where it was.Magda and I watch them, through the big picture windows, in the morning over breakfast, eating bacon and eggs, or oatmeal and bananas. Last year, they devoured most of the corn out of the garden and drove Ronin crazy. This year, the stray neighborhood cat kept them at bay, a large orange Tom with long whiskers and green eyes. Sometimes we leave him treats, tuna fish and sardines, chicken and beef, our leftovers from dinner and lunch. Gourmet table scraps for a visitor acquainted with the streets. A small offering of thanks. For protection.Magda is cutting teeth. For many months now she's had just the two little chiclet ones on the bottom. Chompers we call them. But now the others are coming in all at once and it bothers her some days. We give her chamomile, and oat straw, lemon balm tea sweetened with golden honey, precious drops we collected from the bees last year, when they still buzzed with life. She nurses more. I bought cow's milk, raw, from the farm down the road. She was with me, and we marveled at the large animals, watched them eating, one slow mouthful after the other. I showed her where the milk came from and she laughed. Smooth, pink udders, nearly brushing the floor. But she won't drink it, not from a bottle, and not even warm with cinnamon. We still have time. We still have time together.  And, I tell myself,  she'll be much older by then, won't really need milk to survive. And it will be hard to get I'd think, afterwards. But still I worry. So hard and so often that I think my heart will break.Magda is 13 months old******************************************************Ronin's dark curls and crinkly eyes were still years off when I agreed to The Plan. He didn't exist for me yet, that cold night I pressed my warm hands palm to palm with the others in a show of truth, honesty and commitment. A small and simple gesture to seal our fate.The night I wiped my salty tears from my cheeks and felt my heart pounding it's support.That was the only time I've cried.Things felt very clear to me then, before my edges were softened by love.Blurred.***********************************************************************Dear Ronin,I should have been more careful.Should not have let your rough hands knead the kinks out of my neck, or caress my face with the gentlest touch. Should not have let you point to the stars and talk about space, the endless size of the universe, the intricate process of birthing planets.I should not have let you kiss me with soft lips, or hold me close and whisper in my ear, or unbutton my pants with careful hands.I should not have let you say I love you.I could have stopped you. Could have run the other way, acted cool, aloof.And that's why you'll hate me. When it's all said and done. Because this could have been avoided, all the pain, all the heartache, the broken promises, the lies.So many secrets, parts of my life you've never known. Letters, written in code, slipped into the hands of black-clad couriers, in the shadows near the edge of the street lamps.Phone calls. From seedy payphones and throw away cells.Briefcases, duffel bags. The workshop in the basement of the empty house. I saw the questions in your eyes, the confusion. I tried to kiss it away, to joke, and shower you with love. But still you must have wondered. The guilt so heavy I covered all our mirrors in our house to avoid the look in my own eyes.But that all stopped years ago, when The Plan moved from planning stage to waiting. Long before Magda was born. Even before I peed on the stick, 2 little lines the only sign of new life within.Did I make a mistake? In the heat of the moment, wrapped in your embrace, did I miss my own body's small signals, signs of fertility? Or did I choose not to notice, chose to ignore the possibility of conception that night and instead buried my face in your neck?Because I wanted a baby. The thing we never talked about. my longing. Oh we discussed it many times, how an earth in collapse was no place to raise a child. How the air, and , water, and soil were poisoned, in no shape to support new life. But I ached to be a mom, To watch my flat belly swell, to feel my breasts grow heavy with milk. To make a family with you.Was that a mistake? Magda is a gift, to both of us. She lights up the world. Was it wrong to want that? To bring her here?Knowing what I've known all along?I've been careful, your safety has always been my number one concern. I never led them here, and you will have help in the days that follow. I have made sure of all that.I shouldn't have let you in.But I did.****************************Thank you for reading, and thank you for your support!!",2.0,0,"4 Campaigns

</p>
<p>I am not a prolific story teller, but I have a very
interesting story to tell.  I began
writing my book six months ago and have done a fair amount of research in
self-publishing.  I don’t care to become rich
or famous by writing this book or any book thereafter.  My purpose is to get a message out through
the story I tell.  This is the true value
of memoir.</p>
<p>I WANT to tell this story.</p>
<p>I am finally READY to tell this story.</p>
<p>But …</p>
<p>I also NEED to be published. 
This is why I am seeking your help.</p>
<p>My family and I have a cause that we need to raise money for, and this book is
our last resort.  I speak more about this in the video. YOU ARE BUYING A BOOK  in
advance of publishing (expected completion is December 2014), and YOU MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO RANSOM AN INNOCENT MAN who has been
illegally detained for over 15 months. 
What we can tell you is that his name is Mike and that over the past 15
months we have tried everything and sacrificed everything we had to raise the money
being demanded for his release - $150,000.</p>

with documentation that is the backdrop leading up to his capture.  He is the voice of the other half of his and
my story through this ordeal.  We will be
able to expose all those who turned their backs and wouldn’t help.  That will make an extremely compelling second
book in which we reveal exactly what happened to him and the corruption behind
it, contemporary to what was happening here among those of us living without
him on the other side of the world.  That
is a book I can’t wait to write!! </p>

You help accomplish something amazing by joining
a community of backers 


  The Impact 
Without a doubt, crowd funding is a social strategy and I
need every backer who believes in me to spread the word.  If you can afford $1 and you tell three friends,
your effort is at least quadrupled. My family and I
couldn’t be more grateful for your help in our ambitious goal and we want to
feature your efforts in helping us free Mike. 
Regular ‘community’ emails will share the efforts within the “Free Mike”
community as well as my progress in writing the book.
Please follow me on Twitter - @NidaPeabadly
Future Hype and
Perks:
Future collaborative projects are an option for generous
backers.  When Mike is freed, he returns
with documentation that is the backdrop leading up to his capture.  He is the voice of the other half of his and
my story through this ordeal.  We will be
able to expose all those who turned their backs and wouldn’t help.  That will make an extremely compelling second
book in which we reveal exactly what happened to him and the corruption behind
it, contemporary to what was happening here among those of us living without
him on the other side of the world.  That
is a book I can’t wait to write!!",2.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><b>ABOUT THE
BOOK:</b></p>
<p>I began writing <i>Throne
of Lies</i><span> in
2007. Back then I wasn’t sure what was to come of the story—it started off
small, just simple ideas, and a desire to write. Over the years those miniature ideas began to morph
into a colossal world of its own. One filled with vivid, lovable characters,
and a story waiting to be told. </span></p>
<p><i>Throne of Lies </i>is a fictional fantasy
novel. I chose to write this genre because that is where my passion lies. As a
hardcore fan of all things fantasy and nerd culture, I wanted to write something that I would enjoy reading. <i>Throne of Lies</i>, is the first installment of the <i>Amethysta trilogy series</i>, and is meant
to introduce the characters, the world, and the situation at hand.</p>
<p>I believe <i>Throne of
Lies</i> will be suitable for a broad audience. It's designed to be enjoyed by
young adults as well as adults, and both men and women. I’ve written it in
modern English so that is will be easier to read, while still
holding the focus on a fictional version of the medieval times. Early on
I made the creative decision to set the book into a first-person perspective. The
reason for this is because that is how I’ve always envision this story being
told. You being in the shoes of the main character, Amethysta. While first-person
does limit me in some ways, I find the personal journey to be worth much more.</p>
<p>As of now there is not a set release date, but I estimate that the book will be ready for print in 3-6 months from now. The editorial process alone can take up to a month, and another for layout design. I'm in the process of my final round of editing on my end, then once this is funded (I hope) I can send it off to the company for a line/copy edit. I am hoping this process goes smoothly and quickly, but when it comes to matters such as this, you have to be willing to take things as they come. I will keep everyone updated as things progress.</p>

Featured on the back of the book:
Amethysta, the princess of the human faction, the only heir to Northwind's throne, finds herself forever torn between duty and desire—desperately craving freedom and a life where she can choose for herself, yet bound by the chains of her bloodline. Unbeknownst to the world, she holds a dark secret. Her search for the truth will lead to tears and bloodshed. With each unexpected turn, she encounters devastating losses, uncovers terrifying secrets, and comes face-to-face with the heartache that awaits her. A mysterious blue glow that could change everything, ready to unfold a world of chaos.

<h1>Theo and the Six Seals Series</h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I love reading.</p>
<p>I think that a book can travel you more effectively that any travel agency.</p>
<p>A book has the power to take you to other world and dimensions. Can give you a taste of the future or help you experience events that took place hundreds, even thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>A book can be a source of knowledge and the most intimate of friends. It's not hard to believe it; just think how many times you smiled or cried reading a book.</p>
<p>Sometimes the story is so powerful that it draws you in, and you live the adventures of the character, or feel their pain and joy.</p>
<p>This is why I love to write. I want to make stories that as a reader I would love to read. And I want to share these stories with you, and with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Theo and the Six Seals is a book series for teens and young adults. It's a story about bravery, friendship and sacrifice. It stresses the importance of team work in a fun and adventurous way. The reader will also find a beautifully built world, influenced by ancient Greek mythology, magical creatures, gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>I have self-published some books - which received good reviews.</p>

<p>In order to self-publish my manuscripts, I put in hours and hours of work; from creating and designing the cover art work to reading and re-reading the manuscripts over and over in order to proof them, changing grammatical mistakes and typographical errors and editing the text format to the best of my abilities.</p>
<p>The cover art is not exactly what one would call professional, I did put all my love and taste to make them look great with a minimum budget.</p>
<p>However this was not enough, because all the hours of work were not enough to promote my work and make it known to the world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>My dream is to make Theo and the Six Seals series my first Professionally published book series.</b></p>
<p>Starting with book #1 ""Theo and Morpheus' Medallion""</p>
<p>That means 1) top professional editing, 2) careful formatting for the physical edition and special formatting for the digital editions (like PDF, epub, mobi etc), for every kind of devices such as PC's, tablets, phones and e-book readers. 3) Professional cover design, and if the goals exceed expectations book illustrations to make the book more appealing. 4) Promotion. A professionally made book, no matter how much work and love has been put into it, needs the right promotion in order to be known, purchased and reviewed by the readers. The more the readers know, read and review the book the higher the chances for a successful publication.</p>

I love reading.
I think that a book can travel you more effectively that any travel agency.
A book has the power to take you to other world and dimensions. Can give you a taste of the future or help you experience events that took place hundreds, even thousands of years ago.
A book can be a source of knowledge and the most intimate of friends. It's not hard to believe it; just think how many times you smiled or cried reading a book.
Sometimes the story is so powerful that it draws you in, and you live the adventures of the character, or feel their pain and joy.
This is why I love to write. I want to make stories that as a reader I would love to read. And I want to share these stories with you, and with the rest of the world.
Theo and the Six Seals is a book series for teens and young adults. It's a story about bravery, friendship and sacrifice. It stresses the importance of team work in a fun and adventurous way. The reader will also find a beautifully built world, influenced by ancient Greek mythology, magical creatures, gods and goddesses.
I have self-published some books - which received good reviews.

 Some of my books reviews in Amazon and GoodReads
Unfortunately I was not able to to promote them at all, because promoting is very costly and I did not have the proper budget. So without the required exposure readers are hesitant to buy a self-published book.

 The Songs of the Gods

 Amelia's Adventure
In order to self-publish my manuscripts, I put in hours and hours of work; from creating and designing the cover art work to reading and re-reading the manuscripts over and over in order to proof them, changing grammatical mistakes and typographical errors and editing the text format to the best of my abilities.
The cover art is not exactly what one would call professional, I did put all my love and taste to make them look great with a minimum budget.
However this was not enough, because all the hours of work were not enough to promote my work and make it known to the world.

My dream is to make Theo and the Six Seals series my first Professionally published book series.
Starting with book #1 ""Theo and Morpheus' Medallion""
That means 1) top professional editing, 2) careful formatting for the physical edition and special formatting for the digital editions (like PDF, epub, mobi etc), for every kind of devices such as PC's, tablets, phones and e-book readers. 3) Professional cover design, and if the goals exceed expectations book illustrations to make the book more appealing. 4) Promotion. A professionally made book, no matter how much work and love has been put into it, needs the right promotion in order to be known, purchased and reviewed by the readers. The more the readers know, read and review the book the higher the chances for a successful publication.
Unfortunately a professionally published book is costly.
And this is why I need your help.
Every one of you, from the smallest contributor to the highest sponsor, can make a difference.
With your precious and much appreciated contributions we can make this project come to life.
Thank you so much for being a part of the dream.

</h3>
<p>In Spring 2015, TrineDay will release my first book <i>Aberration In The Heartland Of The Real: The
Secret Lives of Timothy McVeigh.</i> <i>Aberration</i>
draws from a wealth of never-before-seen archives and new material from human
sources, and offers a unique reexamination of convicted bomber Timothy McVeigh,
executed in 2001. </p>
<p>Forget everything you thought you knew about America’s
“Face of Domestic Terrorism.” The book asks: <i>Who Was Timothy McVeigh, Really?</i> I offer startling new
biographical details about McVeigh and exposes stark contradictions and errors
contained in previous depictions of the All-American Terrorist. <i>Aberration</i>
 traces McVeigh’s life from
childhood to the Army, throughout the plot to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah 
Federal
Building and the period after his 1995 arrest until his 2001 execution. 
The archival  and oral sources introduced in my books will contribute a
wealth of contextual detail and new information relevant to several 
sociocultural and political arenas and
will aggressively intercede in debates about the factual details of 
McVeigh’s life
and the bombing.
</p>
<p>McVeigh’s
life, as I describe it, offers a backdrop for her discussion of not
only several intimate and previously unknown details about him, but a number of
episodes and circumstances in American History as well, including: Cold War
popular culture, all-American apocalyptic fervor, organized racism, contentious
politics, militarism, warfare, conspiracy theories and cultures of conspiracy
theorists, bioethical controversies, mind control, the media’s construction of
villains and demons and institutional secrecy and cover-ups.  </p>
<p>Painting’s
next book, tentatively titled, <i>Coup:
The 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing Plot  </i>draws
from her previous and ongoing research as well as significant archival material
generously donated by investigative journalist, Cheri Seymour.(For more on Seymour’s archives, see
her bio below.)</p>
<p>While <i>Aberration</i>
focuses on Timothy McVeigh specifically, <i>Coup</i>
will bring to light critical but never-before-exposed information about the
1995 Oklahoma City bombing plot, trace the labyrinthine forces at work around
it, and detail the lives of several characters embedded (through choice or
fate) within it, telling the story of the brave efforts of private citizens and
journalists who attempted to investigate and expose critical details of the plot.
</p>
<p>With your help, I will significantly expand upon
these and other aspects of the bombing plot, expose to the public some of her
most explosive findings to date, and flesh out an in-depth account of the
conspiracy to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. <i>Coup</i> asks the question: <i>Exactly
who fooled whom when the Ryder truck exploded outside of the federal building
in Oklahoma City? </i></p>
<h3>Use of Funds Generated &amp; Project Timeline </h3>
<p>Even a 
contribution of $10 will go along way. Your contribution will facilitate critical research

<p>In early September 2014, I will travel to California to meet with 
Cheri Seymour in California to pick up and review her archival research 
material. At this time I will begin locating and interviewing long 
silent individuals, and will continue to do so throughout June 2015. 
This will require travel funds to speak with people in Utah, California,
 Arizona, Nevada and other locations. 
</p>
<p><i>Aberration</i> <i>In The Heartland Of The Real: The Secret
Lives of Timothy McVeigh is </i>complete and the manuscript is currently in the
editing process. Minor changes may be required to the manuscript based upon
Cheri Seymour’s archives and investigative material. Research and writing for <i>Coup: The 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing Plot </i>will

 occur from August 2014 to August 2015,
but requires initial and follow-up research, the ability to take time 
off of work to do the research and writing and editorial assistance. 
</p>
<p>I will maintain a publicly accessible blog throughout the research 
and writing process so that contributors and interested parties can keep
 track of my  progress.

seminal investigatory research into the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and Timothy
McVeigh distinguishes her as a leading national expert on both subjects. Her
research has been credited in other books including Roger Charles’ 2012
publication <i>Oklahoma City<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Oklahoma-City-Investigation-Missed-Matters/dp/B00B1KUA4E"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">: What The Investigation Missed and Why It Matters</a></i>. Dr.

</p>
<p>Her research has  included unparalleled access to publicly
and privately held archives as well as countless interviews and
correspondence with individuals throughout the United States, including bombing
victims’ family members, survivors, witnesses, attorneys, private
investigators, journalists, McVeigh’s coworkers, friends, neighbors and
underworld associates: bank robbers, neo-Nazis, militia leaders and many
others. 
</p>
<p>Painting

<div> <h3>About Cheri Seymour 

</h3>
<p>Cheri Seymour has
worked as an investigative reporter, newspaper editor, and private detective
for two decades while pursuing a career as a non-fiction writer. Her real-life
exploration through the criminal labyrinth of the “Octopus,” the endemic
corruption in our government and society, and the theft of the PROMIS software
is reflected in various writings for newspapers and magazines. Beyond <a href=""http://www.trineday.com/paypal_store/product_pages/Last_Circle/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">her book on the subject</a>, these include “The Ghost of Danny Casolaro” in <i>High Times</i> magazine in August 2001. Most
of these writings expose organized criminal elements and their symbiotic
relationship with members of the U.S. government.</p>
<p>A
native Californian born in Los Angeles, Seymour was introduced to writing by
her father, Professor Raynolds Johnson, B.A., Los Angeles State University;
M.A. in English Literature at Stanford University, member of the Greater Los
Angeles Press Club, Sigma Delta Chi, Phi Delta Kappa. </p>
<p>Immediately
after the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City, Seymour was hired as a private
investigator to conduct her own investigation of the bombing. The scope of her
investigation was wide and, during it, Seymour came into contact with and
interviewed some of the most notorious actors among the right wing at that
time, including many who would later become implicated in the bombing plot.In the course of her fearless
investigation, Seymour generated a wealth of explosive and
never-before-published materials, which she has donated to Painting for the
purposes of writing <i>Coup: The 1995
Oklahoma City Bombing Plot.</i></p>
<p>Seymour’s
investigative archives total approximately 10 boxes of materials consisting of
(but not limited to): internal correspondence with and between nationally known
investigative journalists concerning their early investigations into the
bombing plot and their attendance at McVeigh’s 1998 trial; correspondence with
investigators from McVeigh’s legal team; correspondence with other private
investigators working on the case; correspondence with federal agents who
investigated the bombing; internal paperwork originating from various well
known militia groups and white supremacist organizations; and audio and video
interviews with key characters connected to (and some implicated in) the plot;
and never-before-published photographs of the aforementioned characters. </p>
<h3>About TrineDay Publishing </h3>
<p>TrineDay was formed in 2002, when Kris Millegan’s friend Antony
Sutton informed Kris that his book, <i>America’s
Secret Establishment</i> was going out of print. Kris then borrowed $5,000 and
founded TrineDay. Antony was very excited about the new book, and was
scheduling interviews for the book’s release in two months, when he suddenly
died at home, collapsed in his kitchen. TrineDay was left with a book, and no
author to promote it. TrineDay then submitted the book in a cover design
contest and won a national distribution contract with the Independent Publishing
Group in Chicago.</p>
<p>  TrineDay’s second
book <i>Expendable Elite </i>by retired Lt. Col. Dan Marvin was targeted by
the Special Forces Association. Kris was told directly that Americans were not
supposed to know how their wars were fought, and that Special Forces personnel
were not supposed to talk about their experiences. A lawsuit for libel was
brought against Lt. Col. Marvin and TrineDay. They were offered a settlement
requiring that TrineDay and Marvin declare the book fiction. They then defended
themselves in Federal District Court in Charleston, SC, and won a unanimous
verdict from the jury. </p>
<p>  Authors soon
began sending very well-researched and well-written manuscripts that were being
actively suppressed. Nobody was publishing these works. <a href=""http://trineday.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TrineDay</a> has made a mission of bringing these
important books to the reading public.</p>
<p>  Kris Millegan’s
own research began after his father, a repentant former CIA/OSS officer, had
told Kris, in 1969, of his almost twenty-year intelligence career and about
clandestine government-sponsored narcotics trafficking, and also psychological
warfare against our body politic. Kris didn’t understand, but it started him
following the spoor of secrets, trying to comprehend how the world actually works.
</p>
<p>  One day in the
early ’70s, Kris told some friends some of the things his Dad had told him, and
one of them looked at him and told him that he was a “conspiracy theorist.”
Kris scratched his head, and said, “What’s that?” And he soon took on conspiracy
theory as an intellectual discipline, beginning a journey, the journey that
begins once you have been confronted with a different but plausible
“world-view.” A person can simply dismiss it all as the ravings of lunatics and
mentally-challenged individuals, or you can look at the body of works and make
up your own mind. </p>
<p>  Kris, a voracious
reader, began visiting every bookstore he could find, and asked to see their
“conspiracy section.” All of them had at least one book. He soon discovered
that some of these appeared to be formula books. Books designed to get folks to
hate each other, and to blame particular groups for everything. There are books
that blame it all on the Mormons, the Jesuits, the Jews, the Catholics, the
hippies, the secular humanists, the homosexuals, secret societies, aliens, etc.
Most of these books are mis/disinformation, but if you look at them, check
their bibliographies, get those books and follow <i>their</i> bibliographies, you soon find yourself reading dusty volumes
on banking, the drug trade, intelligence matters, history, etc.</p>
<p>  Kris soon
discovered that “conspiracy theory” is used by many different groups in varying
ways, basically as psychological warfare, which is better described by the
German term <i>Weltanschauungskrieg, </i>meaning
“world-view warfare.” But most important was that he did find verification of
what his father had spoken to him about. The implications of that made him
realize that the state of our Republic was dire, and that action needed to be
taken for our children’s futures.</p>
<p>  There is a reason
that dictators and repressive governments burn books. Books are acts of
creation. A good and relevant book takes on a life of its own. We need to
educate and inform ourselves of our situation, because only then can we
extricate ourselves and revive our Republic. </p>
<p>  TrineDay wishes it could finance all of Dr. Painting’s research but they
 can’t. They have tried getting loans from banks. Banks have said no, 
they will not loan money for book projects, especially on controversial 
subjects. Selling suppressed works is a long hard slog, and it simply 
doesn’t generate enough income. TrineDay’s books, and their author’s 
research and findings get ignored by the mainstream media, no matter the
 discussion. Dr. Paintings and Cheri Seymour’s work deserve a wider 
audience and discussion, this can happen with your help.</p>
<p>Kris gets calls
all the time from people wanting to know what they can do. Here is something.
Please help with this important project. These two books will immensely broaden
our understanding of what really happened in Oklahoma, its very deep roots and
implications. They will give us a deeper understanding, so that we may take
educated action towards a beneficial solution for the dysfunctional systemic
corruption that so troubles our world. The money raised goes directly to Dr.
Painting for her research.</p>

never-before-published materials, which she has donated to Painting for the
purposes of writing Coup: The 1995
Oklahoma City Bombing Plot.
Seymour’s
investigative archives total approximately 10 boxes of materials consisting of
(but not limited to): internal correspondence with and between nationally known
investigative journalists concerning their early investigations into the
bombing plot and their attendance at McVeigh’s 1998 trial; correspondence with
investigators from McVeigh’s legal team; correspondence with other private
investigators working on the case; correspondence with federal agents who
investigated the bombing; internal paperwork originating from various well
known militia groups and white supremacist organizations; and audio and video
interviews with key characters connected to (and some implicated in) the plot;
and never-before-published photographs of the aforementioned characters. 
About TrineDay Publishing 
TrineDay was formed in 2002, when Kris Millegan’s friend Antony
Sutton informed Kris that his book, America’s
Secret Establishment was going out of print. Kris then borrowed $5,000 and
founded TrineDay. Antony was very excited about the new book, and was
scheduling interviews for the book’s release in two months, when he suddenly
died at home, collapsed in his kitchen. TrineDay was left with a book, and no
author to promote it. TrineDay then submitted the book in a cover design
contest and won a national distribution contract with the Independent Publishing
Group in Chicago.
  TrineDay’s second
book Expendable Elite by retired Lt. Col. Dan Marvin was targeted by
the Special Forces Association. Kris was told directly that Americans were not
supposed to know how their wars were fought, and that Special Forces personnel
were not supposed to talk about their experiences. A lawsuit for libel was
brought against Lt. Col. Marvin and TrineDay. They were offered a settlement
requiring that TrineDay and Marvin declare the book fiction. They then defended
themselves in Federal District Court in Charleston, SC, and won a unanimous
verdict from the jury. 
  Authors soon
began sending very well-researched and well-written manuscripts that were being
actively suppressed. Nobody was publishing these works. TrineDay has made a mission of bringing these
important books to the reading public.
  Kris Millegan’s
own research began after his father, a repentant former CIA/OSS officer, had
told Kris, in 1969, of his almost twenty-year intelligence career and about
clandestine government-sponsored narcotics trafficking, and also psychological
warfare against our body politic. Kris didn’t understand, but it started him
following the spoor of secrets, trying to comprehend how the world actually works.

  One day in the
early ’70s, Kris told some friends some of the things his Dad had told him, and
one of them looked at him and told him that he was a “conspiracy theorist.”
Kris scratched his head, and said, “What’s that?” And he soon took on conspiracy
theory as an intellectual discipline, beginning a journey, the journey that
begins once you have been confronted with a different but plausible
“world-view.” A person can simply dismiss it all as the ravings of lunatics and
mentally-challenged individuals, or you can look at the body of works and make
up your own mind. 
  Kris, a voracious
reader, began visiting every bookstore he could find, and asked to see their
“conspiracy section.” All of them had at least one book. He soon discovered
that some of these appeared to be formula books. Books designed to get folks to
hate each other, and to blame particular groups for everything. There are books
that blame it all on the Mormons, the Jesuits, the Jews, the Catholics, the
hippies, the secular humanists, the homosexuals, secret societies, aliens, etc.
Most of these books are mis/disinformation, but if you look at them, check
their bibliographies, get those books and follow their bibliographies, you soon find yourself reading dusty volumes
on banking, the drug trade, intelligence matters, history, etc.
  Kris soon
discovered that “conspiracy theory” is used by many different groups in varying
ways, basically as psychological warfare, which is better described by the
German term Weltanschauungskrieg, meaning
“world-view warfare.” But most important was that he did find verification of
what his father had spoken to him about. The implications of that made him
realize that the state of our Republic was dire, and that action needed to be
taken for our children’s futures.
  There is a reason
that dictators and repressive governments burn books. Books are acts of
creation. A good and relevant book takes on a life of its own. We need to
educate and inform ourselves of our situation, because only then can we
extricate ourselves and revive our Republic. 
  TrineDay wishes it could finance all of Dr. Painting’s research but they
 can’t. They have tried getting loans from banks. Banks have said no, 
they will not loan money for book projects, especially on controversial 
subjects. Selling suppressed works is a long hard slog, and it simply 
doesn’t generate enough income. TrineDay’s books, and their author’s 
research and findings get ignored by the mainstream media, no matter the
 discussion. Dr. Paintings and Cheri Seymour’s work deserve a wider 
audience and discussion, this can happen with your help.
Kris gets calls
all the time from people wanting to know what they can do. Here is something.
Please help with this important project. These two books will immensely broaden
our understanding of what really happened in Oklahoma, its very deep roots and
implications. They will give us a deeper understanding, so that we may take
educated action towards a beneficial solution for the dysfunctional systemic
corruption that so troubles our world. The money raised goes directly to Dr.
Painting for her research.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Over 1000 kids have participated in 3C events and programs and raised over 10,000 dollars in the last 3 years.3C's latest endeavor to inspire youth is 40 Story's! This project was inspired by The Search Institute, who architected 40 Development Assets of Leadership as building blocks
of healthy development. Studies show that the average youth has no
more than 20 leadership assets. 40 Story’s will enable our youth community to become
aware of the leadership assets they need, and help them develop them in their lives.  The 40 Story’s experience will culminate in a leadership book
written by 60+ youth from their perspective, to help
youth around the world explore their core leadership skills and strive to be healthy, caring, and
responsible citizens.This project will showcase forty assets of leadership created by the youth community. All forty assets will be displayed in multiple  locations throughout the year, followed by a mega event to acknowledge their contributions. There are 3 main goals that 3C wants to accomplish with this project:

Launch the 40 Story's Leadership Book written from their perspective, to help youth around the world explore their core leadership skills and strive to be healthy, caring, and responsible citizens.

Fundraise for Food Banks 

Host 40 Story's Mega Event - To showcase and recognize the talent of the youth community and how they are making a difference.
We believe that anyone who supports 3C and its mission will help the leaders of the future to develop their core leadership skills and strive to be healthy, caring, and responsible citizens.How did the 40 Assets come to be?The 40 Assets were founded in 1990 by the Search Institute, which released a framework that identified a set of skills, behaviors, and relationships that enable youths to develop into mature adults and leaders. Over the following two decades, the development assets helped kids through school programs and were widely utilized in the world. William Damon from Stanford University described these assets as a ""sea of change"" in adolescent development.What We Need & What You GetWe need to raise 5K to achieve the following goals:Launch 40 Story's Leadership Book

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ask yourself two questions, ""What is the Life I would love to live?"" and ""If I could wave a magic wand, what would I ask for?""  </strong>If you have a Vision or a life-long dream that continues to elude you or that you've more or less given up on, my book will give you fresh perspectives and possibly reinvigorate your intentions to go forward, even if the odds seem against you! Nearly half of ""Life Force Marketing"" is about personal growth -- that may be reason enough to get your own copy.</li>
<li>
<strong>If you're not at all interested in my book</strong>, no worries, there are many other options -- PERKS -- available as a form of Thank You for your contribution and support.  Take a look!</li>
<li>
<strong>Think about </strong>your massage therapist, acupuncturist, caterer, counselor, energy worker, piano teacher... Did you ever stop to think about how difficult it may be for her to keep a steady flow of clients coming back for more?  Your support will have a big ripple effect in the lives of some very good people who could, in many cases, use some help in building sustainable businesses.</li>
<li>
<strong>You can give a girl a break!  </strong> Your support will provide me with the means and tangible encouragement to create a broader audience and continue my work of empowering people around the country, especially through writing, coaching and teaching.

<h3>TESTIMONIALS</h3>
<p>""You are one of the most interesting, informed, intuitive, healing speakers I know.  When you open your mouth and speak...you always move me. And when you write as well.  You are a gifted communicator. You are one of the special rare birds on this planet!!""  <i>Jenny, actor, Nashville</i></p>
<p>""Meriah has an incredible ability to listen and help sort through the complex layers of a newly emerging vision; layers that involve history, new directions, strategy and the practical organization of tasks. She can also implement tasks in and around design work; her designs are beautiful and get results. Meriah also has a remarkable ability to sense when a gentle gesture of mirroring a new idea I have is needed. And she also knows when a slightly stronger suggestion is in need - such as helping me to think about how to pace myself. I feel in good hands with Meriah, and also, I feel as if she is guiding me to ""take a hand"" so to speak, in my own process of rebranding and repositioning my work. I unhesitatingly recommend Meriah and Life Force Marketing.""  <i> Katie Bull,  vocal coach and cross-disciplinary artist, Whole Body Voice (c), NY, NY</i></p>
<p>""Working with Meriah was one of the best business decisions I have made. Her kind heart and creative approach has helped me grow my business and cultivate new relationships. I wouldn’t have flourished to this extent without her push!""  <i>Kalee Vicars, Pure Romance Consultant, Virginia Beach VA</i></p>
<p>“The whole vision of my future just opened up after only one hour of chatting with Meriah. Excited doesn’t even begin to express how I feel about this beautiful journey we have embarked on of self discovery, healing &amp; learning how to let the people know who I AM &amp; that i am HERE!!”                                                                                                                       <i>Hanna Lee, Shamanic Bodyworker, Lexington KY</i></p>

<p> </p>
<h3>WHY did I write this book?</h3>
<p>Since my early 20's, which were spent largely in the San Francisco Bay Area, I've been fascinated with diverse approaches to personal and spiritual growth. Some of those influences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shambhala Buddhist and Native American meditations</li>
<li>Profoundly transformative immersion experiences such as the ""est Training,"" Sunray's Peacekeeper Trainings, Quantum Life Changes retreats, the 4-year Feldenkrais Training, the Bones for Life Training, and Mary Morrissey's DreamBuilder live events</li>
<li>Studies with some of the most profound teachers in the world, too numerous to mention.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In this way I've slowly gathered an understanding of how people grow and change and how they suffer until they figure out a technology for developing new habits of thinking and behaving.  </strong></p>
<p>I wanted to write a book where I could begin to share some of what I've learned, applying it to practical everyday life experiences. <strong>I chose to write THIS book, ""Life Force Marketing,"" to apply the principles of personal transformation and combine them with solid marketing principles that holistic practitioners can use to build more sustainable businesses by reaching and helping more clients. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why? Because I'm on a mission... Don't we all want to change the world for the better?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>My way is to support the people who heal and inspire everyone else</strong>.  By focusing on the welfare of massage therapists, acupuncturists, coaches and therapists, art teachers, energy workers, holistic health advisors and their peers, I believe I can also indirectly benefit the hundreds of thousands of clients they serve every day.  If I can help them build stronger more sustainable businesses, they will be able to use their considerable talents and skills to do more good in the world.  People who read this book may be inspired to see their practices through fresh eyes, reclaim the power of what they offer the world. </p>
<p><strong>Writing and sharing this book as broadly as possible seems like a simple and smart way to spread the word about teachings our world desperately needs today, such as: How to Generate a Powerful Vision, How to Change the Stories You Tell Yourself About Yourself, How to Assess Personal Resources in a New Way that Elevates Self-Confidence, and How and Why You Should Celebrate Every Victory.</strong></p>
<p>These ""inner work"" teachings constitute about half of my book (4 of the 10 steps in Life Force Marketing). The remainder of the book is an introduction to a client-centered holistic marketing approach that works especially well for people who provide services for others in one-person enterprises -- but don't like marketing or selling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;'>HOW I learned about Marketing</strong></p>
<p>The vision-based holistic approach to marketing I’m suggesting in Life Force Marketing is a distillation of what I’ve learned from my own journey with myriad teachers (including university courses and coaching relationships with some of the best marketing experts in the world) and from thousands of life experiences in which I’ve practiced and applied what I’ve learned. This has included my participation in a leadership and marketing role in a number of enterprises, both for-profit and non-profit, over a 35+ year period:  26 years in private practice as a holistic practitioner, 18 years as a dance and movement educator and collaborating artist, 5 years as owner/operator of a women's adventure travel company and 2 years as founder/designer of a boutique greeting card company.

<h3><strong>EXCERPT #1,  from Step 1:  </strong></h3>
<h2><strong>ENVISION the Life You Would Love to Live</strong></h2>
<p>We start with a Vision because without it you’re a ship without a destination.</p>
<p>If your understanding of what you want to accomplish is vague, if for some reason you haven’t expended the time and energy needed to clearly define your Vision in living color, you’re operating at a grave disadvantage.</p>
<p>We begin, at Step One, with fleshing out your Vision for what you want to accomplish, the type of practice or business you want to have, the kinds of people you want to serve, what you want to offer them, the kinds of results you want to facilitate for them, the environment in which you will do this, and more. </p>
<p>It’s a fairly well-kept secret that having a splendid, technicolor, ‘felt’ Vision for yourself that thrills you to the very marrow of your bones is what provides the Life Force required for building and growing any enterprise.</p>
<p>We refer back to your Vision many times throughout your process of choosing, planning and implementing your choices of marketing avenues. As will be made clear as you read along, your Vision for the Life you want to live and the larger mission you have for your work will inform every marketing decision you make. </p>
<p>Moving forward without a vivid, heart-felt Vision is essentially a form of planning to fail. Without it, you lack the fuel needed to keep the warrior spirit alive as you craft your Life-altering business from the ethers.</p>
<p>And that’s why holistic marketing must begin with the development of a Vision that will guide and motivate you every step along the way to building your ideal practice or business. </p>
<p><strong>Let me tell you a story.</strong></p>
<p>In my 20’s I encountered my first network marketing presentation. I had been invited to a friend’s house to learn about a new business idea. I was, even then, sprouting entrepreneurial wings (although I didn’t know it yet). By far the most memorable moment of that evening was when someone flipped to a piece of the large white paper he had suspended on an easel and asked a very provocative question, “If money was no object, what would you do, where would you go, and what would you have?” </p>
<p>This was an Earth-shaking event for me at the time for the simple reason that no-one had ever suggested that I think so freely, imagine so boundlessly. Undoubtedly that’s why I remember it so clearly.</p>
<p>I’ve since heard many variations on this kind of question, each designed to stimulate thinking beyond our current personal paradigm. </p>
<p>One of my favorites is the oft-quoted, “What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?”  This question stirs me deeply; I use it often to talk to myself if I notice that I’m dragging my feet or getting lost in uncertainty about what to do next.  This brilliant question goes to the core of what stops many of us from reaching toward the stars — our fear that we will fail.</p>
<p>More recently I’ve learned a paradigm-busting question that I consider fool-proof in stimulating a grand Life Vision. From the creator of Dreambuilder Coaching, Mary Morrissey, this stellar query is, “What is the Life you would love to live?”  I suggest you begin there.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Envisioning Something We Postpone Doing</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>In the past 10 years I’ve attended dozens of online courses, seminars, live events and symposia on topics related to growing a small business or private practice. In almost every one of those events there’s been some mention of Envisioning. Predictably, most people in the field of business coaching and mentoring agree that having a Vision is important.</p>
<p>Despite this almost universal agreement, I have noticed something ironic. Although each of these very fine teachers, leaders and speakers has a highly developed, well thought out, methodical and detailed curriculum -- only a few give any serious attention to the Envisioning segments of their programs!  It’s almost as if there’s an assumption at work, something like, “This Vision-Building stuff is something anyone can do, so let’s just get it over with and get to the hard stuff!”</p>
<p>This is an erroneous assumption because, sadly, for many people, Envisioning is difficult. As the influential author, Wallace Wattles, wrote, “There is no labor from which most people shrink as they do from that of sustained and consecutive thought; it is the hardest work in the world.”</p>
<p>I would add that when we’re trying to create a Vision of our possible future and sustain that Vision over time while the new circumstances unfold, it’s all the more difficult. I’ve witnessed first hand as talented aspirational people comment about how challenging it is to imagine a boundless future, and I’ve experienced it myself.</p>
<p>Some say they feel stuck in an old view of themselves that prevents them from seeing something more grand or satisfying in the future. Others say that Envisioning reinforces a long-held belief that they’re not creative, that they don’t have much imagination. Still others say that Envisioning something far outside of their current circumstances just seems like wishful thinking and so they don’t enjoy doing it. Some feel vaguely uncomfortable imagining their future but don’t really know why.</p>
<p>Because I understand that Envisioning is both profoundly necessary and, yet, often difficult and frustrating, I emphasize it in my one-to-one coaching and we’re going to go into it more deeply here as well. If you feel tempted to skip over this chapter, I advise you to re-consider!</p>
<p>First, I’d like you to know that it’s entirely possible to train yourself to become a more agile imaginer. I know you can do this because the imagination is much like a muscle -- it benefits from frequent use. If you do two dozen biceps curls with weights, three times a week, your biceps will get stronger. That’s something you can count on.</p>
<p>The same goes with training your imaginative functions. It gets easier with practice.</p>
<p>So let’s do this together!  I’ve put together 6 Key Elements to Envisioning that can help you create your very own techni-color inspiring vision of the practice/business you want to build. </p>
<p>Let’s get started!  Introducing...</p>

<h3>EXCERPT #2,  from Step 5: </h3>
<h2>COMPOSE Your Compelling Stories</h2>
<p>In his best-selling book <i>Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us</i>, the prolific and celebrated author Seth Godin says that marketing is “telling stories that spread.”</p>
<p>The phrase “going viral” entered our collective lexicon in the past decade, demonstrating graphically what it looks like when a story spreads.</p>
<p>Stories that go viral are those that inspire massive levels of interest. They come in many forms. Some are stories told in a largely visual form – a super-cute photo of a baby dancing or a hilarious cat video. They may be brief accounts, in words, of events we find intrinsically irresistible: a Facebook post about a good deed performed, a life saved or the unlikely athletic victory of an underdog.</p>
<p>We may not all have a story to tell that will go viral, but we do certainly all have stories to tell that can reach out to our communities and prospective clients. Telling these stories with imagination and an intention to engage others is a key to building prosperous holistic practices.</p>
<p>In this step, “Compose Your Compelling Stories,” you decide what you want to say to your prospective clients and broadcast to your community (whether online or off). You’ll learn about telling stories to help your ideal clients realize you are the professional they’ve been searching for, and doing so in a way that feels authentic and honest.</p>
<p>This is where your current understanding about what marketing is may be challenged in a substantive and comforting way. You will begin to see that learning to accurately speak and write about what you can do to help others is not only a marketing function, but also a part of the service you provide.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of stories will you need to support your marketing efforts?</strong></p>
<p>Marketing copy is all the words and images you use in your web pages, brochures, social media profiles, etc. Those words and images have to come from somewhere, right? They will come from your efforts to communicate effectively with your Ideal Client. We will focus our efforts here on the words and leave a discussion of imagery to another day, another book.</p>

REASONS to support this campaign even if you're not at all interested in marketing a business!


Ask yourself two questions, ""What is the Life I would love to live?"" and ""If I could wave a magic wand, what would I ask for?""  If you have a Vision or a life-long dream that continues to elude you or that you've more or less given up on, my book will give you fresh perspectives and possibly reinvigorate your intentions to go forward, even if the odds seem against you! Nearly half of ""Life Force Marketing"" is about personal growth -- that may be reason enough to get your own copy.

If you're not at all interested in my book, no worries, there are many other options -- PERKS -- available as a form of Thank You for your contribution and support.  Take a look!

Think about your massage therapist, acupuncturist, caterer, counselor, energy worker, piano teacher... Did you ever stop to think about how difficult it may be for her to keep a steady flow of clients coming back for more?  Your support will have a big ripple effect in the lives of some very good people who could, in many cases, use some help in building sustainable businesses.

You can give a girl a break!   Your support will provide me with the means and tangible encouragement to create a broader audience and continue my work of empowering people around the country, especially through writing, coaching and teaching. Thank you for helping me create a larger picture for myself!

REASONS to  PRE-ORDER this book if you are a holistic or creative service provider...

You'll be among the first to receive your book, delivered directly to your home, in mid-April 2018.  If there's something in here that can help you grow your business, why would you want to wait?


It may be the first marketing book ever written that puts such great emphasis on doing your own inner work. When it comes to people like us, the best marketing always begins with soul-searching.
This is not the first marketing book written for holistic practitioners or for artists of various stripes.  But, in my opinion, it is one of the most ACCESSIBLE.  I've made every attempt to avoid ""marketing speak"" and use everyday language. 
Even if you're someone who hates the idea of selling or promoting yourself, you'll see your concerns addressed here... and come to understand that sharing what you know with the world, letting people know who you are and where they can find you, is a SERVICE, part of your work in the world.  This approach to marketing is in alignment with our values.

It's full of solid marketing principles I've gleaned from 35+ years of training, education and experience!
It's full of colorful, inspiring art and quotations to help keep you reading and keep you going!

TESTIMONIALS
""You are one of the most interesting, informed, intuitive, healing speakers I know.  When you open your mouth and speak...you always move me. And when you write as well.  You are a gifted communicator. You are one of the special rare birds on this planet!!""  Jenny, actor, Nashville
""Meriah has an incredible ability to listen and help sort through the complex layers of a newly emerging vision; layers that involve history, new directions, strategy and the practical organization of tasks. She can also implement tasks in and around design work; her designs are beautiful and get results. Meriah also has a remarkable ability to sense when a gentle gesture of mirroring a new idea I have is needed. And she also knows when a slightly stronger suggestion is in need - such as helping me to think about how to pace myself. I feel in good hands with Meriah, and also, I feel as if she is guiding me to ""take a hand"" so to speak, in my own process of rebranding and repositioning my work. I unhesitatingly recommend Meriah and Life Force Marketing.""   Katie Bull,  vocal coach and cross-disciplinary artist, Whole Body Voice (c), NY, NY
""Working with Meriah was one of the best business decisions I have made. Her kind heart and creative approach has helped me grow my business and cultivate new relationships. I wouldn’t have flourished to this extent without her push!""  Kalee Vicars, Pure Romance Consultant, Virginia Beach VA

Excited doesn’t even begin to express how I feel about this beautiful journey we have embarked on of self discovery, healing & learning how to let the people know who I AM & that i am HERE!!”                                                                                                                       Hanna Lee, Shamanic Bodyworker, Lexington KY

WHY did I write this book?
Since my early 20's, which were spent largely in the San Francisco Bay Area, I've been fascinated with diverse approaches to personal and spiritual growth. Some of those influences:

Shambhala Buddhist and Native American meditations
Profoundly transformative immersion experiences such as the ""est Training,"" Sunray's Peacekeeper Trainings, Quantum Life Changes retreats, the 4-year Feldenkrais Training, the Bones for Life Training, and Mary Morrissey's DreamBuilder live events
Studies with some of the most profound teachers in the world, too numerous to mention.

In this way I've slowly gathered an understanding of how people grow and change and how they suffer until they figure out a technology for developing new habits of thinking and behaving.  
I wanted to write a book where I could begin to share some of what I've learned, applying it to practical everyday life experiences. I chose to write THIS book, ""Life Force Marketing,"" to apply the principles of personal transformation and combine them with solid marketing principles that holistic practitioners can use to build more sustainable businesses by reaching and helping more clients. 
Why? Because I'm on a mission... Don't we all want to change the world for the better? 
My way is to support the people who heal and inspire everyone else.  By focusing on the welfare of massage therapists, acupuncturists, coaches and therapists, art teachers, energy workers, holistic health advisors and their peers, I believe I can also indirectly benefit the hundreds of thousands of clients they serve every day.  If I can help them build stronger more sustainable businesses, they will be able to use their considerable talents and skills to do more good in the world.  People who read this book may be inspired to see their practices through fresh eyes, reclaim the power of what they offer the world. 
Writing and sharing this book as broadly as possible seems like a simple and smart way to spread the word about teachings our world desperately needs today, such as: How to Generate a Powerful Vision, How to Change the Stories You Tell Yourself About Yourself, How to Assess Personal Resources in a New Way that Elevates Self-Confidence, and How and Why You Should Celebrate Every Victory.
These ""inner work"" teachings constitute about half of my book (4 of the 10 steps in Life Force Marketing). The remainder of the book is an introduction to a client-centered holistic marketing approach that works especially well for people who provide services for others in one-person enterprises -- but don't like marketing or selling.
 
HOW I learned about Marketing
The vision-based holistic approach to marketing I’m suggesting in Life Force Marketing is a distillation of what I’ve learned from my own journey with myriad teachers (including university courses and coaching relationships with some of the best marketing experts in the world) and from thousands of life experiences in which I’ve practiced and applied what I’ve learned. This has included my participation in a leadership and marketing role in a number of enterprises, both for-profit and non-profit, over a 35+ year period:  26 years in private practice as a holistic practitioner, 18 years as a dance and movement educator and collaborating artist, 5 years as owner/operator of a women's adventure travel company and 2 years as founder/designer of a boutique greeting card company.

EXCERPT #1,  from Step 1:  
ENVISION the Life You Would Love to Live
We start with a Vision because without it you’re a ship without a destination.
If your understanding of what you want to accomplish is vague, if for some reason you haven’t expended the time and energy needed to clearly define your Vision in living color, you’re operating at a grave disadvantage.
We begin, at Step One, with fleshing out your Vision for what you want to accomplish, the type of practice or business you want to have, the kinds of people you want to serve, what you want to offer them, the kinds of results you want to facilitate for them, the environment in which you will do this, and more. 
It’s a fairly well-kept secret that having a splendid, technicolor, ‘felt’ Vision for yourself that thrills you to the very marrow of your bones is what provides the Life Force required for building and growing any enterprise.
We refer back to your Vision many times throughout your process of choosing, planning and implementing your choices of marketing avenues. As will be made clear as you read along, your Vision for the Life you want to live and the larger mission you have for your work will inform every marketing decision you make. 
Moving forward without a vivid, heart-felt Vision is essentially a form of planning to fail. Without it, you lack the fuel needed to keep the warrior spirit alive as you craft your Life-altering business from the ethers.
And that’s why holistic marketing must begin with the development of a Vision that will guide and motivate you every step along the way to building your ideal practice or business. 
Let me tell you a story.
In my 20’s I encountered my first network marketing presentation. I had been invited to a friend’s house to learn about a new business idea. I was, even then, sprouting entrepreneurial wings (although I didn’t know it yet). By far the most memorable moment of that evening was when someone flipped to a piece of the large white paper he had suspended on an easel and asked a very provocative question, “If money was no object, what would you do, where would you go, and what would you have?” 
This was an Earth-shaking event for me at the time for the simple reason that no-one had ever suggested that I think so freely, imagine so boundlessly. Undoubtedly that’s why I remember it so clearly.
I’ve since heard many variations on this kind of question, each designed to stimulate thinking beyond our current personal paradigm. 
One of my favorites is the oft-quoted, “What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?”  This question stirs me deeply; I use it often to talk to myself if I notice that I’m dragging my feet or getting lost in uncertainty about what to do next.  This brilliant question goes to the core of what stops many of us from reaching toward the stars — our fear that we will fail.
More recently I’ve learned a paradigm-busting question that I consider fool-proof in stimulating a grand Life Vision. From the creator of Dreambuilder Coaching, Mary Morrissey, this stellar query is, “What is the Life you would love to live?”  I suggest you begin there.
Why is Envisioning Something We Postpone Doing?
In the past 10 years I’ve attended dozens of online courses, seminars, live events and symposia on topics related to growing a small business or private practice. In almost every one of those events there’s been some mention of Envisioning. Predictably, most people in the field of business coaching and mentoring agree that having a Vision is important.
Despite this almost universal agreement, I have noticed something ironic. Although each of these very fine teachers, leaders and speakers has a highly developed, well thought out, methodical and detailed curriculum -- only a few give any serious attention to the Envisioning segments of their programs!  It’s almost as if there’s an assumption at work, something like, “This Vision-Building stuff is something anyone can do, so let’s just get it over with and get to the hard stuff!”
This is an erroneous assumption because, sadly, for many people, Envisioning is difficult. As the influential author, Wallace Wattles, wrote, “There is no labor from which most people shrink as they do from that of sustained and consecutive thought; it is the hardest work in the world.”
I would add that when we’re trying to create a Vision of our possible future and sustain that Vision over time while the new circumstances unfold, it’s all the more difficult. I’ve witnessed first hand as talented aspirational people comment about how challenging it is to imagine a boundless future, and I’ve experienced it myself.
Some say they feel stuck in an old view of themselves that prevents them from seeing something more grand or satisfying in the future. Others say that Envisioning reinforces a long-held belief that they’re not creative, that they don’t have much imagination. Still others say that Envisioning something far outside of their current circumstances just seems like wishful thinking and so they don’t enjoy doing it. Some feel vaguely uncomfortable imagining their future but don’t really know why.
Because I understand that Envisioning is both profoundly necessary and, yet, often difficult and frustrating, I emphasize it in my one-to-one coaching and we’re going to go into it more deeply here as well. If you feel tempted to skip over this chapter, I advise you to re-consider!
First, I’d like you to know that it’s entirely possible to train yourself to become a more agile imaginer. I know you can do this because the imagination is much like a muscle -- it benefits from frequent use. If you do two dozen biceps curls with weights, three times a week, your biceps will get stronger. That’s something you can count on.
The same goes with training your imaginative functions. It gets easier with practice.
So let’s do this together!  I’ve put together 6 Key Elements to Envisioning that can help you create your very own techni-color inspiring vision of the practice/business you want to build. 
Let’s get started!  Introducing...
The 6 Key Elements for Igniting Your Powerful Vision
1st Key Element:  ASK Provocative Questions
2nd Key Element:  EXERCISE your Imagination by Thinking Bigger
3rd Key Element:  DOCUMENT Your Vision

COMPOSE Your Compelling Stories
In his best-selling book Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us, the prolific and celebrated author Seth Godin says that marketing is “telling stories that spread.”
The phrase “going viral” entered our collective lexicon in the past decade, demonstrating graphically what it looks like when a story spreads.
Stories that go viral are those that inspire massive levels of interest. They come in many forms. Some are stories told in a largely visual form – a super-cute photo of a baby dancing or a hilarious cat video. They may be brief accounts, in words, of events we find intrinsically irresistible: a Facebook post about a good deed performed, a life saved or the unlikely athletic victory of an underdog.
We may not all have a story to tell that will go viral, but we do certainly all have stories to tell that can reach out to our communities and prospective clients. Telling these stories with imagination and an intention to engage others is a key to building prosperous holistic practices.
In this step, “Compose Your Compelling Stories,” you decide what you want to say to your prospective clients and broadcast to your community (whether online or off). You’ll learn about telling stories to help your ideal clients realize you are the professional they’ve been searching for, and doing so in a way that feels authentic and honest.
This is where your current understanding about what marketing is may be challenged in a substantive and comforting way. You will begin to see that learning to accurately speak and write about what you can do to help others is not only a marketing function, but also a part of the service you provide.
What kinds of stories will you need to support your marketing efforts?
Marketing copy is all the words and images you use in your web pages, brochures, social media profiles, etc. Those words and images have to come from somewhere, right? They will come from your efforts to communicate effectively with your Ideal Client. We will focus our efforts here on the words and leave a discussion of imagery to another day, another book.

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>Warrior Entrepreneur is a book about the warrior spirit. The book looks at the science of adversity and highlights stories from the modern-day military, historical warriors, entrepreneurs and all warriors who have used their adversity as opportunities for growth. This book highlights the intangible traits that all warriors share, such as grit, overcoming challenges, teamwork, tenacity, purpose, confidence, adaptability, sacrifice and mental health.<br/><br/>My name is Zachary L Green, and I am the author of Warrior Entrepreneur. I wrote this book because, as a US Marine and an entrepreneur, I found that the same intangible traits I learned from my time in the US Marine Corps and as a firefighter were the same traits that made me successful as an entrepreneur. I wanted to not only share my story of overcoming challenges and fighting through my personal crucibles but also share stories of others who have grown from their adversity and used those lessons to accomplish their life’s missions.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that adversity can be tremendous teaching opportunities. The adversity could be anything from a challenging upbringing to military service to business and life hardships. Anybody can be a warrior when you look at adversity as opportunities for growth and training, for fighting through any crucible that may happen in your life. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have learned from my time in the US Marine Corps, being a firefighter and an award winning entrepreneur. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you conquer your crucibles and achieve your life’s mission.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about grit and tenacity. You'll hear stories such as...<ul>
<li>A Presidential diplomatic mission to Sudan as a civil war was starting to erupt.</li>
<li>A US Marine Corps aviator short on fuel whose wingman crashed as they were trying to land an aircraft carrier in rough seas.</li>
<li>The first female graduate of US Marine Corps Infantry School</li>
<li>You will love this book if you are an entrepreneur, a leader or anyone who wants to accomplish their life’s mission.</li>

<h3>The Story of <i>Yellow Flowers</i>
</h3>
<p>There is a species of yellow flowers that grows in the mountains of the Greater Caucasus, and there are children who in 13 years haven’t been able to smile at their blossoming in the spring. This book is the story of these children, these mountains, and the yellow flowers that grow on them, but also an attempt at offering these flowers back to their children, now grown up and away from home.<br/><br/>My name is Elena Vedovello and I am the author of <i>Yellow Flowers.</i><br/><br/>I wrote this book because five years ago, when I moved from my country, Italy, to Armenia, I met Anano, a friend of mine who was born in Akhalgori, Georgia, but had been forced to move away in 2008, when a war with Russia led to a now thirteen-year-long occupation. Anano’s story is the story of many other children, families, and communities, that suffered the consequences of crushing politics and armies, in Akhalgori and many other towns in Georgia. <i>Yellow Flowers</i> is a way to let this story reach you through the fictional depiction of a very real tragedy. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover, in all its human components, one of the realities that thousands of Georgians had to face in the aftermath of the 2008 war. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with the themes of displacement, oppression, growth, endurance, and a deeply-rooted ancient culture.<br/><br/>On a sunny August afternoon, 8-year-old Ana is playing with her doll on the street just outside her home. She is surrounded by the neighborhood children, a few hens, and the mountains everyone in Akhalgori considered loyal old friends. In a second, everything changes as a near-by explosion brings confusion and whispers to the town. A few hours later, many residents of Akhalgori are beginning their exodus towards the south, leaving behind their homes, their lush gardens, their elderly, and life as they knew it.<br/><br/>For Ana and her family, the future is uncertain. They temporarily move to the capital, Tbilisi, but the only certainty is the uncertainty in the answers they get. Families reunite, protests happen, the government gives and withdraws information, and the world is watching. For little Ana, everything seems confusing. It is the building of an IDP settlement in the winter of 2008 that oxymoronically offers some familiarity to Ana’s family: neighbors are found and the idea of continuity is possible. <br/><br/>Just like that, Ana and the other children from Akhalgori learn to inhabit the newly built streets of their settlement, amid the whispering of adults, the hidden pain of elderly neighbors, and the unknown dynamics of displacement, families separated by borders, and occupation. <br/><br/><i>Yellow Flowers</i> is a story of growth away from home, the endurance of roots on infertile ground, loss, and the eternal beauty of being young and learning about oneself.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you find beauty in the stories of those near and far, if you’ve ever travelled to Georgia or if you never have; if you grew up in the mountains or used to absentmindedly draw green hills in school; if you yearn to learn more about the world, and if you’ve seen enough in the eyes of those around you. <i>Yellow Flowers</i> will be an interesting read if you know about the 2008 war, but also if you’ve never heard of it. It will intrigue you if you like fiction based on real-life events. If you’ve ever lost a home, whether physically, metaphorically, mentally, emotionally, or spiritually, this book was written for you.<br/><br/><i>Yellow Flowers</i> speaks to former children everywhere whose hearts are open to a new, yet ageless story, which will teleport them far away, only to then return within. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Yellow Flowers </i>inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like: how is a home built, and what does it mean that it can be lost? How do communities survive amid loss and displacement? How does oppression, big and small, transform our lives? <br/><br/>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!</p>

<h2>The Story of You Are Where You Go</h2>
<p><br/>My name is Caitlyn Lubas and I am the author of<i> You Are Where You Go: A Traveler’s Coming of Age Journey Through 70 Countries and 7 Continents During College</i>. I wrote this book because I wish I had been able to read a book like this from the perspective of a young, 22-year old traveler who was just a normal student, not a travel writer or influencer, when I was starting my journey as a young traveler. </p>
<p>My book is on track to be published on November 23, and this presale helps me fund the cost of creating the book – from editors to cover designers to marketing and PR teams, I've already made a lot of personal investments into this passion project and need YOUR HELP to bring it across the finish line!</p>
<p>See below for a description of my book, where the money raised will be spent, more about me, and other ways to support if you can’t donate.<br/><br/><strong><i>You Are Where You Go</i> is a traveler’s take on the classic saying “you are what you eat.”</strong><br/><br/>By writing and publishing the book, I seek to inspire others with my personal stories of how travel has changed my perspectives and shaped me into the person I am today. My goal is to prompt readers to see travel as a tool for personal development and to spark readers’ desires to learn and grow outside of their comfort zones, because everywhere you go becomes a part of you!<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that travel can be the best way to explore the world while also exploring yourself. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to vicariously visit different corners of the world, to escape from your everyday life for a few hours, and learn alongside me in this collection of stories that captures how different places around the world have taught me essential life lessons that shaped my personality, worldview, and life philosophy.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Readers can discover unique travel stories like:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Learning to protect and preserve nature after visiting the penguins, whales, and seals of Antarctica</span></li>
<li>Realizing the things in life we often take for granted after camping on an overland safari in Eastern Africa for 6 weeks straight</li>
<li>Learning about empathy after a motorbike accident in rural Vietnam</li>
<li>Discovering how to maximize life by trekking through Argentinian Patagonia</li>
<li>Exploring solo travel vs partner travel in Australia</li>
<li>Spending every weekend in a different country for 10 months while studying abroad in Europe and Southeast Asia</li>
<li>Living the digital nomad, remote work life throughout dozens of different cities in the US after quitting my corporate job and deciding to travel full time</li>
</ul>
<p>Each chapter shares a perspective-shifting moment that shows how exploring the world can be one of the best ways to explore yourself by learning and growing outside of your comfort zone.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are an aspiring traveler, an avid young traveler, digital nomad, or if you're just passionate about travel and exploring different cultures. If you like reading memoirs from a unique perspective about once-in-a-lifetime experiences that no one except the author could possibly write, this book is for you.</p>

The Story of You Are Where You Go
My name is Caitlyn Lubas and I am the author of You Are Where You Go: A Traveler’s Coming of Age Journey Through 70 Countries and 7 Continents During College. I wrote this book because I wish I had been able to read a book like this from the perspective of a young, 22-year old traveler who was just a normal student, not a travel writer or influencer, when I was starting my journey as a young traveler. 
My book is on track to be published on November 23, and this presale helps me fund the cost of creating the book – from editors to cover designers to marketing and PR teams, I've already made a lot of personal investments into this passion project and need YOUR HELP to bring it across the finish line!
See below for a description of my book, where the money raised will be spent, more about me, and other ways to support if you can’t donate.You Are Where You Go is a traveler’s take on the classic saying “you are what you eat.”By writing and publishing the book, I seek to inspire others with my personal stories of how travel has changed my perspectives and shaped me into the person I am today. My goal is to prompt readers to see travel as a tool for personal development and to spark readers’ desires to learn and grow outside of their comfort zones, because everywhere you go becomes a part of you!My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that travel can be the best way to explore the world while also exploring yourself. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to vicariously visit different corners of the world, to escape from your everyday life for a few hours, and learn alongside me in this collection of stories that captures how different places around the world have taught me essential life lessons that shaped my personality, worldview, and life philosophy.
 
Readers can discover unique travel stories like:

Learning to protect and preserve nature after visiting the penguins, whales, and seals of Antarctica
Realizing the things in life we often take for granted after camping on an overland safari in Eastern Africa for 6 weeks straight
Learning about empathy after a motorbike accident in rural Vietnam
Discovering how to maximize life by trekking through Argentinian Patagonia
Exploring solo travel vs partner travel in Australia
Spending every weekend in a different country for 10 months while studying abroad in Europe and Southeast Asia
Living the digital nomad, remote work life throughout dozens of different cities in the US after quitting my corporate job and deciding to travel full time

Each chapter shares a perspective-shifting moment that shows how exploring the world can be one of the best ways to explore yourself by learning and growing outside of your comfort zone.You will love this book if you are an aspiring traveler, an avid young traveler, digital nomad, or if you're just passionate about travel and exploring different cultures. If you like reading memoirs from a unique perspective about once-in-a-lifetime experiences that no one except the author could possibly write, this book is for you.
 
What We Need & What You'll GetYour support in pre-ordering this book means the world to me, as I’ve paid upfront money to many of the partners that have helped me create and publish my book. This pre-order campaign will help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

Editors – I’ve worked with a Developmental Editor, who helped enhance the overall style of my writing from the very beginning, chapter-by-chapter; an Acquiring Editor, who read my entire first draft manuscript and made suggestions for overall flow and chapter tie-in to the main theme and message; a Marketing and Revisions Editor, who will again revise my book chapter by chapter; a Copyeditor who will read the book line-by-line to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication; and a Proofreader who will take one final pass before sending the manuscript off to the printing press!

The Cover Design – I’ll be working with a cover designer to create my dream book cover and go through three iterations until it is as perfect as it can be! As a Kickstarter backer, you’ll be invited to give your feedback and help me choose the final book cover. (The mockups you see of “You Are Where You Go” on the blue book cover currently are a placeholder!)

The Layout Design – For the interior of my book to fit the correct dimensions of a hardcover, paperback, and ebook, I’ll be hiring a specialist to design the interior formatting along with slots for a photo from my travels that represents each of the chapters!

The Launch & Promotion Efforts – even if I write the greatest book in the world, if no one knows about it, the book will not be a success! I’m working with an incredible social media marketing agency, a PR agency, a digital creator for Instagram AR effects, and more to help get the word out about my book leading up to my publication date this fall.

I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish and a handwritten thank-you note.

Your name will be printed in my book in the Acknowledgments section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”).
You will receive early access to the Introduction and some excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback in the months of August and September.
You will have the opportunity to vote on my final cover design.
You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process (through my Close Friends story on @you.are.where.you.go on Instagram and/or through my You Are Where You Go Facebook group!
And much more!

 
Campaign Goals Standard Tiers:Tier 1: Hit $5,000 and the softcover and ebook get publishedTier 2: Hit $7,000 and the hardcover will be publishedTier 3: Hit $8,500 and I'll get to create an audiobook edition, available on Audible!

As the #MeToo movement pulls our country towards sexual violence realities, that question is the undercurrent that allows us to pull back.</p><p>""But, why didn't she report?"" We ask, and we remain doubtful. We remain safe. </p><p>Sometimes it sounds different, sandwiched between words that make it softer. Less critical. ""I totally believe her, what I just don't get is, if it actually happened, why didn't she report back then?""</p><p>Sometimes it sounds like a valid point. As Dr. Christine Blasey-Ford testified against her assailant in 2018, the question echoed across America. We were all forced to consider, ""Well, why <i>didn't </i>she report?""</p><p>Our president tweeted it: ""I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!"" (@realDonaldTrump, September 21, 2018)</p><p><i>Unreported </i>explains why those filings don't exist. This book answers the question once and for all, by asking different women: ""Why didn't you report?"" <i>Unreported</i> is a compilation of conversations with those women, a renowned detective, and authors and advocates in the sexual assault spheres. The author analyzes famous case studies of people who did report, and draws on her own story. She, too, has been asked: ""Why didn't you report?""</p><p>To read <i>Unreported </i>is to sit with your doubt, and risk feeling a little unsafe.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Note: People of color (Black women, in particular), are at disproportionate risk of sexual violence. With that truth in mind, and considering the purpose of this book, a percentage of the profits will be donated to The Loveland Foundation, which brings opportunity and healing to communities of color, and especially to Black women and girls.</strong></p><p> </p><h3>The Book - Unreported</h3><p>The book is written in 3 Parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + a few chapters on how to read the book — a manual to get you going.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 4-9. These chapters are the intricate, anonymous retellings of untold stories: they grew out of interviews with people who did not report their sexual assault/rape. We consider how the system made it impossible to report, and then contrast their stories with case studies in which people did.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 10-13. Here, we pair anecdotal evidence from the women’s stories in Part 2 with expert interviews and facts.

We've all heard the question. As the #MeToo movement pulls our country towards sexual violence realities, that question is the undercurrent that allows us to pull back.""But, why didn't she report?"" We ask, and we remain doubtful. We remain safe. Sometimes it sounds different, sandwiched between words that make it softer. Less critical. ""I totally believe her, what I just don't get is, if it actually happened, why didn't she report back then?""Sometimes it sounds like a valid point. As Dr. Christine Blasey-Ford testified against her assailant in 2018, the question echoed across America. We were all forced to consider, ""Well, why didn't she report?""Our president tweeted it: ""I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!"" (@realDonaldTrump, September 21, 2018)Unreported explains why those filings don't exist. This book answers the question once and for all, by asking different women: ""Why didn't you report?"" Unreported is a compilation of conversations with those women, a renowned detective, and authors and advocates in the sexual assault spheres. The author analyzes famous case studies of people who did report, and draws on her own story. She, too, has been asked: ""Why didn't you report?""To read Unreported is to sit with your doubt, and risk feeling a little unsafe. Note: People of color (Black women, in particular), are at disproportionate risk of sexual violence. With that truth in mind, and considering the purpose of this book, a percentage of the profits will be donated to The Loveland Foundation, which brings opportunity and healing to communities of color, and especially to Black women and girls. The Book - UnreportedThe book is written in 3 Parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + a few chapters on how to read the book — a manual to get you going.Part 2 contains Chapters 4-9. These chapters are the intricate, anonymous retellings of untold stories: they grew out of interviews with people who did not report their sexual assault/rape. We consider how the system made it impossible to report, and then contrast their stories with case studies in which people did.Part 3 contains Chapters 10-13. Here, we pair anecdotal evidence from the women’s stories in Part 2 with expert interviews and facts. A former detective, advocates, best-selling journalist, and a therapist help create our vision for a better system going forward. What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

<p></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Ramón Martos and I write for several Heavy Metal publications around the world, including MetalUnderground.com, This Is Metal Magazine, PureGrainAudio.com, HeavyMetalArtwork.com and many others. I’m also the author of “...And Justice For Art: Stories About Heavy Metal Album Covers.”</p>
<p>“...And Justice For Art” (softcover edition) is a one-of-a-kind collection of stories, stunning graphics, and  revealing interviews about the making of some of the greatest album covers in the history of Heavy Metal music. It includes all the particulars behind artworks as iconic as <b>Slayer's ""Reign In Blood,"" Morbid Angel's ""Blessed Are The Sick,"" Metallica's ""And Justice For All,"" Death's ""Symbolic,"" Carcass ""Heartwork,"" Black Sabbath’s “13”, Cormorant's ""Dwellings,” At The Gates' ""Slaughter Of The Soul,""Testament's ""Dark Roots Of Earth,"" Opeth's ""Heritage,"" Mayhem’s “Grand Declaration Of War,” </b>and dozens of others. </p>
<p>After three years researching, interviewing musicians and visual artists, and securing the rights to showcase the 400+ graphics featured in the book, “And Justice For Art” is ready to be printed... Now, I would like to share with you a great opportunity to make history together, to become partners in this effort that is aimed to change the way the world looks at Heavy Metal album covers.</p>
<p>Your contributions would make a tremendous difference in the outcome of this project, that—according to Morbid Angel’s frontman, David Vincent (who wrote the foreword)—has all the potential to become “a historical document about the importance of Metal album covers.”</p>

</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>“And Justice For Art” is the result of my 3-decades-old obsession with album covers. This started at a very early age when I was growing up in Cuba, as a Metal fan.  In my youth, I basically relied on 3rd generation tapes, usually obtained from the black market. These cassettes didn't feature any kind of artworks, so my friends and I had to create our own graphics in order to give some visual context to the music we were listening to.</p>
<p>Many years later, after moving to United States, I started developing the online series ""And Justice For Art"" and its companion Facebook community. Both are dedicated to promoting the works of many talented artists and the artworks accompanying the hundreds of Metal albums that are released every month.</p>
<p>This book is an extension of those online efforts. It's also a space to coherently compile the 100 exclusive interviews I conducted with  Metal icons like <b>Jeff Walker (Carcass), Charlie Benante (Anthrax), Max Cavalera (Soulfly, ex-Sepultura), Fenriz (Darkthrone), Sebastian Bach (Skid Row), Maniac (ex-Mayhem), Paul Masvidal (Cynic), Chris Adler (Lamb Of God) David Vincent (Morbid Angel) </b>and celebrated visual artists like<b> Michael Whelan, Eliran Kantor, Dan Seagrave, Joe Petagno, Travis Smith, Arik Roper, </b>and<b> Paul Elledge</b>, among many others.  </p>

<p>I believe that “And Justice For Art” will provide fans plenty of first-hand information regarding to the creation of these fabulous images. As Cattle Decapitation’s frontman, Travis Ryan, recently commented, this could be “exactly what the music world needs to remind us all just how important album covers have been to all of us that grew up surrounding ourselves with physical media.”</p>

</div>
<p>
</p>
<p>“And Justice For Art” is finished and ready to go to the printer. With your help, the book could be available before the end of 2014! I've already spent more than $6,000.00 securing the permissions I needed to use most of the images featured in the book and paying for the cover's and layout's design... However, manufacturing a book like this (264 pages long and full color) is a costly enterprise. I've reached a point where, sadly, my limited financial resources are just not enough. <br/></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>That's why I believe <span>your support through</span> this crowd-funding campaign <span>will help</span> me to raise the rest of the money I need to manufacture “And Justice For Art.” The specific amount of money I’m asking will allow me to produce a considerable amount of copies (between 300 and 500, depending on the raised amount) under reasonable costs per unit, without sacrificing high quality printing standards. </p>
<p><b>Even if the campaign's goal is not met, I will combine whatever raised amount with the modest funds I have left from my original $7,000.00 budget to print as many physical books as possible.</b></p>
<p></p>
<h2>What You Get</h2>
<p>The perks offered to those who will support this effort are worth the commitment. <b>To begin with, everyone contributing, no matter the amount, will be included in the book’s Thanks &amp; Acknowledgement credits.</b> Also, some of the bands involved on the project, like <b>At The Gates, Cattle Decapitation, Morbid Angel, Obituary, While Heaven Wept, Katatonia</b> and others, were extremely generous and donated really cool items for the campaign. Some of them are signed and in some cases, even personalized! Please, feel free to check the list of perks for more info.</p>

It includes all the particulars behind artworks as iconic as Slayer's ""Reign In Blood,"" Morbid Angel's ""Blessed Are The Sick,"" Metallica's ""And Justice For All,"" Death's ""Symbolic,"" Carcass ""Heartwork,"" Black Sabbath’s “13”, Cormorant's ""Dwellings,” At The Gates' ""Slaughter Of The Soul,""Testament's ""Dark Roots Of Earth,"" Opeth's ""Heritage,"" Mayhem’s “Grand Declaration Of War,” and dozens of others. 
After three years researching, interviewing musicians and visual artists, and securing the rights to showcase the 400+ graphics featured in the book, “And Justice For Art” is ready to be printed... Now, I would like to share with you a great opportunity to make history together, to become partners in this effort that is aimed to change the way the world looks at Heavy Metal album covers.
Your contributions would make a tremendous difference in the outcome of this project, that—according to Morbid Angel’s frontman, David Vincent (who wrote the foreword)—has all the potential to become “a historical document about the importance of Metal album covers.”



The Book's Impact



“And Justice For Art” is the result of my 3-decades-old obsession with album covers. This started at a very early age when I was growing up in Cuba, as a Metal fan.  In my youth, I basically relied on 3rd generation tapes, usually obtained from the black market. These cassettes didn't feature any kind of artworks, so my friends and I had to create our own graphics in order to give some visual context to the music we were listening to.
Many years later, after moving to United States, I started developing the online series ""And Justice For Art"" and its companion Facebook community. Both are dedicated to promoting the works of many talented artists and the artworks accompanying the hundreds of Metal albums that are released every month.
This book is an extension of those online efforts. It's also a space to coherently compile the 100 exclusive interviews I conducted with  Metal icons like Jeff Walker (Carcass), Charlie Benante (Anthrax), Max Cavalera (Soulfly, ex-Sepultura), Fenriz (Darkthrone), Sebastian Bach (Skid Row), Maniac (ex-Mayhem), Paul Masvidal (Cynic), Chris Adler (Lamb Of God) David Vincent (Morbid Angel) and celebrated visual artists like Michael Whelan, Eliran Kantor, Dan Seagrave, Joe Petagno, Travis Smith, Arik Roper, and Paul Elledge, among many others.  




I believe that “And Justice For Art” will provide fans plenty of first-hand information regarding to the creation of these fabulous images. As Cattle Decapitation’s frontman, Travis Ryan, recently commented, this could be “exactly what the music world needs to remind us all just how important album covers have been to all of us that grew up surrounding ourselves with physical media.”
What We Need 



“And Justice For Art” is finished and ready to go to the printer. With your help, the book could be available before the end of 2014! I've already spent more than $6,000.00 securing the permissions I needed to use most of the images featured in the book and paying for the cover's and layout's design... However, manufacturing a book like this (264 pages long and full color) is a costly enterprise. I've reached a point where, sadly, my limited financial resources are just not enough. 



That's why I believe your support through this crowd-funding campaign will help me to raise the rest of the money I need to manufacture “And Justice For Art.” The specific amount of money I’m asking will allow me to produce a considerable amount of copies (between 300 and 500, depending on the raised amount) under reasonable costs per unit, without sacrificing high quality printing standards. 
Even if the campaign's goal is not met, I will combine whatever raised amount with the modest funds I have left from my original $7,000.00 budget to print as many physical books as possible.

What You Get
The perks offered to those who will support this effort are worth the commitment. To begin with, everyone contributing, no matter the amount, will be included in the book’s Thanks & Acknowledgement credits. Also, some of the bands involved on the project, like At The Gates, Cattle Decapitation, Morbid Angel, Obituary, While Heaven Wept, Katatonia and others, were extremely generous and donated really cool items for the campaign. Some of them are signed and in some cases, even personalized! Please, feel free to check the list of perks for more info.

Even if you are not interested or can’t collaborate with the making of this book, please help us to share this campaign with the rest of the world via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media. Even one Like, Tweet or Share could help to make the difference.  You can also follow the book’s development and find out more news about album covers via the ...And Justice For Art’s Facebook site: https://www.facebook.com/pages/And-Justice-For-Art/123376774515018

Supported by advertising and events, the magazine featured work from some of the best journalists in town, not to mention sleek visuals and gorgeous photography. Soon its focus expanded to report on not only bikes, but also walking and mass transit. Today, its mission is to cover Philadelphia through the prism of mobility.</p>

<p>We’ve learned a lot in two years, and our work is closer than ever to the pulse of the city. Now, we need your help to put out our most ambitious issue yet. Issue Six will include many great stories, such as a deep dive into the transportation challenges of South Philly’s immigrant community, a visual investigation of one of the city’s most iconic avenues, and a personal account of how a fractured sidewalk complaint system fails parents with strollers. As always, <i>SPOKE</i> tells human stories without shying away from the nitty-gritty of politics and policy. It takes a long time to strike this balance, but the perennial issue of mobility — of a citizen’s right to move around his or her own city safely, affordably and efficiently — is worth the effort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although run by a team of volunteers, <i>SPOKE</i> has always made sure to pay its freelancers for their work. Printing a physical magazine, and distributing it for free, allows us to serve a broad cross section of the Philadelphia community. But these commitments come with costs that can put financial strain on an independent operation like ours. In order to provide the best possible version of Issue Six, we ask for $3,500 in contributions so that we can fairly compensate our freelancers and print the kind of magazine that our readers deserve.</p>

Issue Six will include many great stories, such as a deep dive into the transportation challenges of South Philly’s immigrant community, a visual investigation of one of the city’s most iconic avenues, and a personal account of how a fractured sidewalk complaint system fails parents with strollers. As always, SPOKE tells human stories without shying away from the nitty-gritty of politics and policy. It takes a long time to strike this balance, but the perennial issue of mobility — of a citizen’s right to move around his or her own city safely, affordably and efficiently — is worth the effort.
 
Although run by a team of volunteers, SPOKE has always made sure to pay its freelancers for their work. Printing a physical magazine, and distributing it for free, allows us to serve a broad cross section of the Philadelphia community. But these commitments come with costs that can put financial strain on an independent operation like ours. In order to provide the best possible version of Issue Six, we ask for $3,500 in contributions so that we can fairly compensate our freelancers and print the kind of magazine that our readers deserve.

Can't donate? You can still help. Spread the word and tell your friends, neighbors and coworkers about SPOKE magazine. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

<h3>About OSIRIS</h3>
<p>Those who know me will know I've been writing seriously and working to become a professional writer for the last decade. Earlier this year I was absolutely thrilled to announce that my dystopian SF novel OSIRIS is to be published by <a href=""http://www.nightshadebooks.com/cart.php?m=product_detail&amp;p=251"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Night Shade Books</a> in June 2012, with two sequels to follow. OSIRIS will be published in the USA and Canada, but not as yet in the UK.</p>
<p>To help promote the book, a group of other Night Shade authors have asked me to join them at the World Science Fiction Convention in Chicago (<a href=""https://chicon.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chicon</a>) in September, which gets a huge amount of traffic. As a new author it's difficult to get your name out and this is a fantastic opportunity for me to showcase the book and ensure that it has the best chance possible to do well.</p>
<p>There is only one hitch to this: the cost of getting there. Flights to Chicago cost around £480 (circa $765), and as a struggling writer (I hate to be a cliché but it's true :)) I simply can't afford the fare.</p>
<p>(To put this into some sort of context, the last time I was on a plane was in 2006!)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What I Can Give</h3>
<p>My goal is to cover my full costs for:</p>
<div>The London-Chicago flight - $765 (£480)</div>
<div>The Convention membership - $215 (£135)</div>
<p>Anything you can contribute, however small, will go towards this.</p>
<p>Anything I raise in addition will help with the costs for the Night Shade party, accommodation, buying some more books to take with me, and day-to-day expenses while I'm over there.</p>
<p>I'm offering:</p>
<p>For an $4 (£3) donation - a smile and a thank you!</p>
<p>For an $8 (£5) donation - an e-copy of my short story <em>The Complex</em>, previously published in Interzone magazine</p>
<p>For a $15 (£10) donation - a signed printed copy of my short story <em>The Complex</em></p>
<p>For a $23 (£15) donation - a signed printed copy of my story <em>Super Falcon and the Peregrine Nation</em></p>

<h3>The ""Back Flap"" Summary</h3>
<p class=""p1"">William Peregoy was always awful at languages. The first 'F' he ever made in his life was in middle school Spanish. Even in high school, he would constantly make dismal grades on <em>English </em>vocabulary tests. His SAT score to get into college was very lopsided (high in math, mediocre at best in verbal). Why? Because he was ""bad"" at learning vocabulary, he was ""bad"" at memorization. Things just didn't stick - even English vocabulary! But in his mid-20s something changed. He decided to no longer accept the fact that he as ""good at math, but horrible at memorization"" and he studied how human memory works, how to remember things, and how to learn. In order to test his findings he set out to Japan to do the ""impossible"" - to learn Japanese in <span class=""s1"">only</span> 3 months! Japanese is largely considered one of the ""hardest"" languages for an English speaker to learn. So, how did he do it? How did somebody who struggled to memorize even English vocabulary in high school learn thousands of Japanese words and characters in only a couple of months? How is it that someone who took years of Spanish but struggled to get anywhere in the language can now hold whole conversations completely in Japanese - about virtually any topic: ranging from religion to politics to even sports? Read on to enjoy his inspiring story of his 3 months studying Japanese in Tokyo, discover the real secrets behind memory and learning, and even learn Japanese yourself - if you want to, that is.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Learning New Skills</h3>
<p class=""p1"">Learning new skills. This is something I've always had interest in, and maybe you do too. It's something I've been reading a lot about and studying up on for the past few years. I've come up with all sorts of ideas and theories about how to achieve things and how to learn new things. So I recently decided to put some of these theories of learning to the test in the best example I could come up with - something I have always struggled with personally - learning new languages. </p>
<p class=""p2"">In order to test this, I wanted to start from scratch and I wanted to pick something good and challenging. So, I chose Japanese. A language that instills fear in the hearts of most English speakers: it has 3 different alphabets (all of them derived from Chinese characters), completely backwards grammar, and not much in common with the English language at all.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Challenge &amp; What I Learned</h3>
<p class=""p1"">So, I decided to give it a shot. I moved to Tokyo for 3 months and worked really hard at studying and speaking Japanese. Yes, it was difficult. At times it was down right frustrating. I almost threw my computer out of the 2nd story window at Starbucks. But, guess what?  I did it. Now, I won't call myself fluent by any means, but I am fairly conversational. I've had conversations strictly in Japanese that have lasted for hours and have covered topics as wide ranging as business, sports, and even politics. I've pretty much shocked every Japanese person I met when I told them I've only been studying for a couple of months. And, I've shocked myself a few times too. (""I just had an hour long conversation in Japanese about the difference between Japanese and American politics?!? What!!??"")  That's much better than my Spanish has ever been… and I've taken Spanish in school virtually my whole life.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Needless to say, I learned a lot. And, I didn't just learn Japanese. I learned how people learn and how to learn things effectively. Throughout my life, I always thought I was good at math, but bad at memorizing things (like vocabulary in a language) and now I've finally figured out why. I also figured out that that's just not true. We are all capable of learning new things; pretty much whatever we want to learn. It's just that most conventional methods of learning either teach us poorly or only teach us in one particular way that only works for a small subset of people. But there are much better methods to learning things. Methods that will work for everybody.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Plan: What Your Money Will Go Toward</h3>
<p class=""p1"">So, here's what I plan to do: I'm going to write a book. It will be a book focused on learning new skills quickly, and it will use Japanese as an example. It's going to be written in a way where if you actually want to learn Japanese - it will be the only book you would ever need to buy; and if you don't want to learn Japanese you will still be able to get a lot out of it as you can still apply the foundation and methods presented to learn whatever it is you want to learn - in probably less than half of the time you previously thought possible. I already have the framework for it laid out and some of the chapters started, but I need your help…</p>
<p class=""p2"">I'm launching an Indiegogo campaign to crowdfund the completion and launch of the book. Here's what the budget entails and what the money will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""p2"">hiring an assistant to help me organize and plan everything (likely based in either India or the Philippines),</li>
<li class=""p2"">some light travel to meet and discuss theories and methods with experts on learning (have to have expert opinions of course. I want this book to be as complete as possible), and perhaps most importantly</li>
<li class=""p2"">the launch and initial marketing surrounding the launch of the book.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1"">My expected timeline for the completion of the book is 6-8 months and of course I promise to keep you updated along the way. And, better yet - anybody who donates anything over $5 will get a digital copy of the book when it comes out. Just let me know if you want it in Kindle, Nook, or PDF and we'll figure it out and get it sent to you when the book is completed. I hope you will enjoy reading it as much as I think you will.</p>
</div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p class=""p1"">If you feel like you can help out and any other ways please let me know.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For example:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""p1"">Spread the word about this campaign: tell your family and friends</li>
<li class=""p1"">If you know someone who is an expert or focuses in research/academic study in fields such as human memory and/or learning, please let me know.</li>
<li class=""p1"">If you or somebody you know would be willing to review and edit draft copies of the book before the final book is completed, please let me know.</li>
</ul><h3>Thank you for your time and your interest in my project.</h3>

Just let me know if you want it in Kindle, Nook, or PDF and we'll figure it out and get it sent to you when the book is completed. I hope you will enjoy reading it as much as I think you will.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you feel like you can help out and any other ways please let me know.
For example:

<h3>What is The Mirror?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Mirror will be a new literary arts magazine working in alliance with Active Minds on Ithaca College campus. Active Minds is an organization that works to increase the discussion surrounding mental health and decrease the stigma surrounding mental illness. The Mirror is a project working under the umbrella of Active Minds, therefore working towards the same goals. The Mirror hopes to highlight the individual narratives within the collective mental health experience through creative media, such as poetry, creative writing, photography, personal narrative, painting, etc. In addition, we aim to spread awareness about the mental health resources available in the Ithaca community.</p>
<h3>Where does your money go?</h3>
<p>Any money you donate will go directly towards printing costs to ensure that The Mirror will be made available to anyone and everyone. </p>
<h3>Where and Why</h3>
<p>One of the major ongoing projects that Active Minds completes is Speak Your Mind panel discussions (SYM panels). The SYM Panel was created in 2010 by the Ithaca College chapter of Active Minds. Its goal is to change the conversation about mental health by using the student voice to raise awareness about mental illness. This unique program educates students through direct interaction with their peers and encourages attendees to ask questions about mental health in a completely judgment-free, safe environment. Each panel consists of 3-5 Ithaca College students sharing intimate stories about their experiences with mental health in order to further benefit the student community, promote education, and to eliminate the stigma around seeking help.  The main distribution of The Mirror will occur after these panel discussions. The idea is that people will literally be able to carry the discussion out the door. We hope that this will inspire further conversion in new environments; therefore, normalizing the topic. The magazine will also be available in select areas of the greater Ithaca community and throughout campus, including the Counseling and Psychological Services building. The funds we raise through this indiegogo will be used to directly fund the printing costs of The Mirror. The magazine will be totally submission based. We have been working to gain submissions by creating a Facebook page, in class advertisements, public announcements, etc. Furthermore, we are excited to work with the local Ithaca New Roots High School. A sophomore class will be having a competition, and the best piece will be published in The Mirror. Hopefully this will increase good mental health practices at younger ages. We are also holding fundraising events to try to gain the rest of the money for printing costs.</p>

<h3 align=""center""><em><strong>A sacred journey of twins</strong></em></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Ever had a dream that woudn't let you go?  A bold longing that dared you to move beyond your fear to deeper faith?  I'm finally saying yes and I invite you to join me on this journey.  </p>
<p>My name is Lorelei.  I’m a <a href=""http://blog.bryantpark.org/2010/09/word-for-word-poetry-blogs_13.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">poet</a> and social entrepreneur from Harlem and I arrived in the world two minutes after my identical <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=32729993&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">twin sister</a>, a filmmaker and TV producer.  With Andrea, I took my first trip to Brazil, igniting a decade-long love affair with that land.  My wombmate and my enchantment with Brazil inspired me to write my first novel Janaína. </p>
<p><strong>My new  book is a magical realism thriller set in Harlem and Brazil.</strong>  It traces the lives of three generations of twins beginning with their ancestral mothers in West Africa to modern day twins Dia and Mia who are separated as toddlers when their own mother is imprisoned. Dia becomes a “menina da rua,” one of Brazil’s many street children.  Mia is secretly adopted by an American couple that head a Harlem church.  Ten years later, Mia receives a shocking medical prognosis and returns to search for her twin in the streets of Brazil where Dia is embroiled in a high-stakes gamble with organ traffickers.  The twins are reunited in the fight of their lives during Brazilian Carnival.<em> </em></p>
<p>My writing has appeared in <em>Essence Magazine, Meridians Journal</em> and <em>African Voices.</em>  It’s been featured in several anthologies, most recently, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Women Warriors of the Afro-Latina Diaspora.</span>  With Janaína, I’m fully surrendering to my passion, taking my creativity to the next level, and hoping to tell an important story about the resilience, struggles and beauty of Black girls growing up in the US and Brazil. </p>
<p>Your help will bring this story to life!  I’ve already written a 236-page first draft and <strong>I need your help</strong> to raise a minimum of $11,000 to cover project expenses (travel costs, archival research, copy-editing, fiscal sponsorship fees, book design) and an additional $10,000 enabling me to fully engage in writing this empowering story.  Through my fiscal sponsor, Fractured Atlas, your donation is tax-deductible.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>What’s in it For You?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>A scandalous virtual vacation during Brazilian Carnival</li>
<li>Connection to your body’s self-healing wisdom: body as flute, altar, bridge</li>
<li>Glimpses into the secret world of twins</li>
<li>Life affirming instruction from healers in Black-Indigenous spiritual traditions</li>
<li>Lyrical communion with the sacred in nature</li>
<li>A window on Black children’s ingenuity and challenges in the US and Brazil</li>

<h3><strong>The Roots of Janaína</strong></h3>
<p>Janaína embodies so many strands of my identity, work, and travels across the African Diaspora: I am a twin from a line of eight sets of twins.  I’ve dedicated my life to empowering young people in Africa and its Diaspora for nearly fifteen years.  I am an initiate of the Afro-Brazilian religion <a href=""http://ctl.du.edu/spirituals/religion/santeria.cfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">candomblé</a> and you’ll also find me in a Black Baptist church many Sundays.  My father, a Jamaican merchant marine, named me for a mermaid.  I share his quixotic madness, his passion for trans-Atlantic travel, and his obsession with Black freedom movements.  I’m also a domestic violence survivor and recently began training as a <a href=""http://www.somaticsandtrauma.org/approach.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">somatic healer</a> to work with other survivors of violence and trauma. In writing Janaína, I’ve found a place for imagination, memory, ancestry and activism to intersect. It is a thrilling and healing process.    </p>
<p><strong>In Brazil, the name Janaína is synonymous with the orixá (divine spirit) Iemanjá.</strong>  She is associated with oceans, motherhood and with Atlantic Ocean, which carried so many of our ancestors through the Middle Passage. Iemanjá has been a powerful force in my life.  </p>
<p><em>Read more on the roots of the book <a href=""http://www.loreleiwilliams.com/janaiacutena.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>: including the legendary tale of twin girls, Otampê and Gogorisa Ojaro, who survived the Middle Passage to Brazil in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. </em><em> </em></p>

<h3>
<strong>Big Risk, Big Reward: Why Trust Me?</strong><strong> </strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>Janaína</strong> is my most ambitious project to date.  My writing has been acknowledged through fellowships from the Breadloaf Young Writer’s Conference, Cave Canem and the New York Foundation for the Arts.  My work has appeared in <em>Essence Magazine</em>, <em>Meridians</em>, and <em>African Voices</em> and featured in anthologies: <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Be the Dream</span> (Algonquin Books); <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Women Warriors of the Afro-Latina Diaspora</span> (University of Houston Arte Público Press); <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Beyond the Frontier: African-American Poetry for the 21st Centur</span><em>y</em> (Black Classic Press); and <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Daddy Can I Tell You Something?</span> (Sela Press). </p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where Will the Money Go?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Travel costs and related fees for a return to Brazil to complete research for the book (archival study on the slave trade in Brazil, first-person interviews with young people living in the streets and in the prisons of Bahia, Carnival producers, and people impacted by the public tensions around religious intolerance in Brazil).</li>
<li>A novel-writing workshop to fine-tune and workshop chapters of the book</li>
<li>Professional copy-editing services for a publication-ready final manuscript <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>Cover design artist honorarium</li>
<li>Printing and production of limited edition book prototypes</li>
<li>Fees collected by IndieGogo (@4%) &amp; fiscal sponsor <a href=""http://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/fiscal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fractured Atlas</a> (7%) </li>
<li>Production, processing and postage for supporter rewards</li>
<li>Mini-Grants to 2-4* US and Brazilian youth/community-based organizations.  Aligned with my values of reciprocity, I’d like to give something in return to the US and Brazilian young people I interview.  Where appropriate, I’d like to give small grants to support organizations working with these young people.  Beyond mini-grants, I’ll also donate poetry / writing workshops where there is interest, but I want to honor the financial challenges that these groups face in delivering their services.<em> *Number of mini-grants depends on how much is raised.</em>
</li>
</ul><p>Want to really invest in the success of this book?  Support my reach goal: an additional $10,000.  It would be ideal to have three months to attend a writers colony, incorporate all the edits from my writing class and copy-editor, review the book layout and design and do final rewrites with exclusive focus.</p>
<p><strong>Can't donate but want to help?  </strong>Make some noise!  Tweet, tweet, tweet, email your friends, share on Facebook, post on blogs and connect with your community.<strong>  </strong>Write an article or blog about the campaign.  Call your buddies to ask them to invest!  And send up some affirming prayers – your positive energy will be a wonderful contribution! </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why IndieGogo Before Publishing?</strong></h3>
<p>Before I submit a manuscript to a potential publisher (or self-publish it), I want it to be fully polished.  Debut novelists and short story writers (especially those with few publications in the same genre) often struggle to land publishing deals.  I want to strengthen my manuscript as much as possible.  Publishers also want to ensure that there is a viable market for my novel.  My IndieGogo supporters (hopefully, including you!) will affirm that readers are interested in <strong>Janaína</strong>.  Building community around the themes in the novel is an important personal goal for me – and IndieGogo is a great tool for that.</p>

<strong> </strong><strong>FAQs</strong>
</h2>
<p><strong>1. What is IndieGogo and how does this thing work? </strong>IndieGogo is one of the world’s largest crowdfunding websites, generating millions of projects in over 160 countries.  IndieGogo charges 4% for successful projects and 9% for projects that don’t meet fundraising goals.  Founded in 2008, the company has appeared on Bloomberg, Oprah, Today, and the BBC, as well as in the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.  Learn more <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/learn-how-to-raise-money-for-a-campaign"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>2. How do I donate?</strong> Click the “CONTRIBUTE NOW” button on the right hand side of the page.  You will be asked to input your pledge amount and select a reward. From there, you will go to the checkout page.  Enter your total gift amount and choose your Reward/Donor Appreciation Gift.   Enter your credit card information.  (FYI, your credit card information is protected and is never saved by Indiegogo].  Enter an email address where you would like to receive your contribution receipt.  Once my IndieGogo campaign ends in July, I will request  your address and to follow-up on any additional reward related matters.  </p>
<p><strong>3. What happens if you surpass your fundraising goal?  </strong>I will be over the moon!  If I pass the first goal ($11K), funds will go towards focused writing time for the reach goal ($10K).  If I surpass the entire goal ($21K), funds would be used to enhance my marketing plan and to give additional donations to the youth organizations receiving mini-grants through this project.</p>
<p><strong>4. What happens to the funds if you don’t reach your fundraising goal?  </strong>This is a two-tiered fundraising campaign.  If I don’t raise the entire first goal ($11K) then I may not be able to complete some of the items outlined above – or each phase  take a significantly longer time to complete.  If I don’t reach the second fundraising goal (an additional $10K), I will not be able to dedicate three months of full-time writing to finish the manuscript, interrupting the momentum and delaying the writing process..</p>
<p><strong>5. I want to get in your suitcase?  When are we going to Brazil?  </strong>I’ve coordinated tours to Brazil in the past and led a group of 21 people there in 2010.  I don’t have plans to lead a tour this year, but I will personally create a tour agenda for you and connect you to contacts in Brazil (Salvador, Rio and São Paulo) for donors over $1,000.  </p>
<p><strong>6. Can I make an anonymous donation?  </strong>You can adjust how your name and contribution amount is displayed publicly on my campaign’s “Funders tab ”on the IndieGogo website.

<p><em>Options: </em></p>
<ul>
<li>Your name &amp; contribution amount will be shown on the campaign page.</li>

<li>Your name will be shown on the campaign page, but only the campaigner will see your contribution amount.</li>
</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7. What if I can’t give right now?  </strong>All your support and encouragement is so valued.  Creative suggestions are so welcome.  And you can get your friends to pledge.  Shout it out from the hills!!!  If you’ve got even $5 that helps boost our backer numbers as much as someone giving $500 or $5,000. </p>
<p><strong>8. Why don’t you get a fellowship to complete this writing project – why raise individual funds on IndieGogo? </strong> That’s a great idea.  I am actually applying for fellowships for the project – and if you know of grants I should apply for, <a href=""mailto:janaina.book@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">please let me know</a>.  Since I’m registered with a fiscal sponsor (Fractured Atlas), I can receive grants from foundations, corporations, faith-based organizations, etc.  Often, grant cycles can take a long time between submission and notification.  I want to complete my research and start conversations with you around the research and themes in the novel as soon as possible and your support will help me do this.  [Also see Q7 above re: building community and demonstrating public support for this project.</p>
<p><strong>9. Is shipping and handling covered for the rewards?  </strong>S&amp;H is including for all items being shipped within the U.S.  International shipping costs will depend on the country where rewards will be shipped.  Please allow for additional time for international delivery – and <a href=""mailto:janaina.book@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact me directly</a> for the associated shipping costs.</p>

I want to get in your suitcase?  When are we going to Brazil?  I’ve coordinated tours to Brazil in the past and led a group of 21 people there in 2010.  I don’t have plans to lead a tour this year, but I will personally create a tour agenda for you and connect you to contacts in Brazil (Salvador, Rio and São Paulo) for donors over $1,000.  
6. Can I make an anonymous donation?  You can adjust how your name and contribution amount is displayed publicly on my campaign’s “Funders tab ”on the IndieGogo website. There are three visibility levels (below).  You will be able to elect your contribution's visibility status during the Share stage of the contribution process, right after you submit your payment information.  I’ll note your preferences for donor listings on my own personal website also.
Options: 

Your name & contribution amount will be shown on the campaign page.
Your contribution amount will be shown on the campaign page, but only the campaigner will see your name.
Your name will be shown on the campaign page, but only the campaigner will see your contribution amount.
 
7. What if I can’t give right now?  All your support and encouragement is so valued.  Creative suggestions are so welcome.  And you can get your friends to pledge.  Shout it out from the hills!!!  If you’ve got even $5 that helps boost our backer numbers as much as someone giving $500 or $5,000. 
8. Why don’t you get a fellowship to complete this writing project – why raise individual funds on IndieGogo?  That’s a great idea.  I am actually applying for fellowships for the project – and if you know of grants I should apply for, please let me know.  Since I’m registered with a fiscal sponsor (Fractured Atlas), I can receive grants from foundations, corporations, faith-based organizations, etc.  Often, grant cycles can take a long time between submission and notification.  I want to complete my research and start conversations with you around the research and themes in the novel as soon as possible and your support will help me do this.  [Also see Q7 above re: building community and demonstrating public support for this project.
9. Is shipping and handling covered for the rewards?  S&H is including for all items being shipped within the U.S.  International shipping costs will depend on the country where rewards will be shipped.  Please allow for additional time for international delivery – and contact me directly for the associated shipping costs.
10. Have another question?  If so, please feel free to contact me directly

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings. This book, this project, has been a long time coming. </p>
<p>It has taken me forever to be able to publicly express what only a few people have known about me: I am a survivor of childhood abuse- physical, emotional, and sexual. </p>
<p>I grew up in a house where bruises, beatings, and threats were the norm. Where the cold crept in during the winter, chilling you to the bone, because the missing glass in the window panes had been stuffed with old trash bags. Where the living room smelled of urine because my stepfather was often so drunk, he'd mistake the television stand for the toilet.  Where you had to be as... quiet... as... possible... so you didn't draw attention to yourself.  Where the roles of ""victim"" and ""abuser"" were often held by the same people.</p>
<p>I grew up in a house of violence, all of it culminating with my stepfather shooting my mother.</p>
<p>This book is my own ""purging"",if you will, my own form of self-administered therapy.  It was difficult to write, and will no doubt be difficult to read.  I have decided to publish it, and I wish to self-publish, so I have full control over everything that is in the final product.  While writing, I noticed there is scant literature available for how men are affected by domestic violence and child abuse.  This project is not an attempt to politicize the issue, to try to take attention away from the women who need help.  Instead, it is a plea to the world at large to remember that we are all in this together, that no matter what your gender, growing up in a stable, loving household is paramount to producing stable, loving, healthy adults.  It is also a warning of what can happen to a child raised in a disturbed, disfunctional home, and how the scars he developed as a child shape the way he views the world as an adult.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to do genuine good with this book.  First, I want to provide a voice, to show other men who were abused as a child that they need not be silent, that they need not ""tough it out"" or ""suck it up"" and ""get over it"".  Victims of abuse, no matter what their gender, race, or orientation, need the opportunity to heal.  Part of healing is knowing and accepting that there are others out there who have survived.</p>
<p>Secondly, I intend to make a difference in my own community.  I now live in Puerto Rico, and my adopted home has an high incidence of domestic violence:</p>
<p><a href=""http://womensenews.org/story/domestic-violence/100820/puerto-rican-women-face-rising-tide-violence#.UJ2KuWd5GFB"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://womensenews.org/story/domestic-violence/100820/puerto-rican-women-face-rising-tide-violence#.UJ2KuWd5GFB</a></p>
<p>I have decided that 1/3 of all profits from every sale of this book will be donated to La Casa Protegida Julia de Burgos, an organization that provides temporary housing and other services for victims of domestic violence:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.casajulia.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.casajulia.org/</a></p>
<p>Thus, you have a chance to do real good by contributing to this project.  If you contribute enough to obtain a copy of the book, every time you look at it on the shelf, you'll know that not only did you help that very book come to fruition, but through the donations this project will make to La Casa Protegida Julia de Burgos, you helped someone desperate, alone, and frightened to have a place to sleep while they tried to start repairing their shattered lives.</p>
<h3>Your Donation</h3>
<p>Your donation will be used for the following:</p>
<p>1.  Payment to my editing staff.</p>
<p>2.  Promotions and advertisements, especially in small bookstores.</p>
<p>3.  Costs associated with hard-copy self-publishing.  Full disclosure:  Currently, I am leaning towards using Amazon's self-publishing service, as it seems professional and easy to use, but if anyone knows of other self-publishing services, I am open to suggestions.</p>
<p>4.  Costs associated with distributing the printed copies of the books (mailing, USPS, Fedex, etc).</p>
<p>5.  Fees for using this site.  This is a great site, that is why I chose it, but you get what you pay for.  A free site wouldn't have given me this amount of exposure.  Basically, if I make my goal of $4,000.00, I get to keep about $3,750.00.</p>
<p>6.  If there is any money left over after the project is realized, this money will be treated as if it were ""profit"" money, and 1/3 will be donated to Casa Protegida Julia de Burgos.</p>

<h3><strong>Updates</strong></h3>
<p>I will make weekly updates on this page.  These updates will consist of selected writings from my book, with the hope of generating interest in this project, as well as giving examples of what the finished project will be like.  Each update will remain on this site for only a week, and then will be replaced by the subsequent update.</p>

<p><span class=""rvts8"">When we think back and talk with others about what happened on the morning of 9/11/2001, the familiar question always arises, “Where were you and what did you experience?” Standing Tall details the accounts of people from all over the world as they share their thoughts and experiences on the morning of September 11th, 2001. Compiled to raise funds for the World Trade Center memorial, Standing Tall gives an exceptional response from professional writers, composers, military personnel, and a pacifist struggling to come to terms with what that moment would bring. We hear from a twelve year old girl attempting to make sense of something so inconceivable, we also are given firsthand accounts from people inside the towers, and volunteers who have up everything to be there.</span></p>
<p><span class=""rvts8"">The Indigogo funds are needed to promote the book, do a book signing tour and to give books to the generous people who contributed their writings to the work. In order to reside the optimum founds for the memorial the book needs maximum exposure.</span></p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Less than a week after the World Trade Center was taken down by two of our own domestic airplanes…I left New York. Not because I was fearful, although I admit to that at times, but because my family lives in other states. My 90-year-old Grandmother was in Grand Rapids Michigan. So I took a journey across our country, just as it was starting to come to terms with its violation.</p>
<p><span class=""rvts8"">What struck me was that every place I went, I was greeted with warmth and with curiosity. Being from New York had a new spin on it. No longer were you the hardened sophisticate from the big city. You were a survivor of a war act. Everyone I spoke with wanted to know my tale. Where had I been at the time of the attack? How were the people of New York?</span></p>
<center>
<p><span class=""rvts8""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.standingtallbook.net/pics/002.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
</center>
<p><span class=""rvts8"">Likewise, they were anxious to share their place in this event. How they had heard of the attack. What they believed would happen next. During this trip I decided that this book should be born. The world was in a collective consciousness. The tales of shock, horror and heroism needed to be shared. There was no better reason to collect this than to help the victims of September 11th. So my proceeds from this book will go to charity.</span></p>
<p><span class=""rvts8"">There were literally thousands of emails that flooded the Internet over the weeks following the tragedy. I began to collect personal accounts, articles, spiritual writings, creative writings and journals expressing the spirit of the world during this time. It was not a particularly easy task to track down some of the original origins of the emails. Luckily many people I know are extremely articulate and firsthand accounts of the impact worldwide daily appeared in my mailbox.</span></p>
<center>
<p><span class=""rvts8""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.standingtallbook.net/pics/003.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
</center>
<p><span class=""rvts8"">I have included my own email and journal of the event, which includes the process of putting together this book. I have used photos that I have taken over the life of the World Trade Center. I wish now I had taken more, but as Richard said in his journal ”They were so much a part of our skyline they had become incidental to most photographs.” The cover photo was taken through my car sunroof while sitting at a light on the West Side Highway. I looked up and could not believe the strength of the towers above. Now I look downtown with sadness that they are gone. And say a prayer that those that went with them know in some measure know how much they are mourned.</span></p>
<p><span class=""rvts8"">Years later we are still standing tall. New York, the USA and the World. It is up to each of us to make sure we continue to do so by not allowing fear to run our lives. May this book help heal through communication some of the pain but also community that was felt on September 11 2001.<br/></span></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Gist</h3>
<p>The goal of <em>Our Ancestors’ Recipes</em> project is to create a recipe book that will contain the best recipes from our ancestors, along with their stories.  Through this project I will connect with people who have fabulous recipes that have been handed down generation to generation.  I plan to make each recipe personally and choose the best of the best along with the stories that may accompany the recipes.  I will then compile these recipes and stories into a recipe book.</p>

<p>But far deeper than my memories are the historical significance of where these recipe originated.  The recipes of my ancestors are steeped in the immigration of the early 1900s, WWI, the great depression, WWII, the movement of the 60s and more.</p>
<p>Those are MY ancestors.  But what about your family, your friends, your neighbors?  I would like to create a recipe book, compiled of recipes that have been handed down generation after generation, steeped in delicious ingredients, rich history and great love, from all over the country, perhaps from countries around the globe.</p>
<p><em>Our Ancestors’ Recipes</em> project will take me into places where our seniors congregate such as places of worship, senior citizen centers and reunions, to talk with them and collect their stories and their recipes.  My family has recipes that go back 100 years.  But I know that there are recipes in our communities that go back even further. </p>
<p>On each page of the <em>Our Ancestors’ Recipes</em> book there will be the person’s recipe and their story (or ancestor’s story) and if possible their picture (or their ancestor’s picture).  This will provide a glimpse of the history they lived through and the significance of that recipe for their family. </p>
<p>We need food to survive, and we use food to celebrate and to console.  History has shaped our recipes; our recipes have shaped our family history and our memories. Pierogies take me back to a simpler time, where many afternoons were spent cooking with my grandmother.  Root beer floats, complete with whip cream and a cherry, were shared with my grandparents on warm summer nights. We all have memories surrounding great food and I want to preserve these recipes, our recipes, and our stories surrounding them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I want to have the freedom to fully dedicate the next three months to researching and writing this book.  I want to be free of distractions so I can talk with people and gather their stories and recipes.  The funds for this project will go towards research, collecting and organizing the recipes and stories, making each recipe, writing and editing the book, and graphic design.  <br/><br/> If you are able to contribute to my project, there are several perks available.  Every person who contributes will be mentioned on the OurAncestorsRecipes.com website.  Other perks include a free copy of the .pdf version of the book before the book goes live, a first release paperback copy of the book, an opportunity to have your ancestor's recipe featured in the book or an opportunity to have a picture of your ancestor on the front cover.</p>
<p>(Payment is made through PayPal, but you do not need to have a PayPal account to contribute.  Once you click on the payment button, you will see the option to enter your credit card information if you do not have a PayPal account.)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am passionate about family history and food!  This project brings both of these together in a poignant and delicious way.  Within one book people will be able to read stories of those people who have lived before us and shaped our lives.  The book will also contain recipes that have been handed down through the generations that we can incorporate into our own families and hand down to future generations. </p>
<p><em>Our Ancestors' Recipes</em> will be a keepsake that can be treasured now and in the future by our children and grandchildren.  My hope is that this book will also inspire families to share their own stories with their children, so that their stories are not lost to future generations.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute money, I truly understand.  Or if you prefer to wait for the release of the book to buy it, I understand that as well!</p>
<p>It would be a HUGE help if you could forward this to people that you know.  You can do this through Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or word of mouth!   You can use the Indiegogo share tools to make it easy!  The more people who know about <em>Our Ancestors' Recipes</em> the better this book will be! </p>

I want to have the freedom to fully dedicate the next three months to researching and writing this book.  I want to be free of distractions so I can talk with people and gather their stories and recipes.  The funds for this project will go towards research, collecting and organizing the recipes and stories, making each recipe, writing and editing the book, and graphic design.   If you are able to contribute to my project, there are several perks available.  Every person who contributes will be mentioned on the OurAncestorsRecipes.com website.  Other perks include a free copy of the .pdf version of the book before the book goes live, a first release paperback copy of the book, an opportunity to have your ancestor's recipe featured in the book or an opportunity to have a picture of your ancestor on the front cover.
(Payment is made through PayPal, but you do not need to have a PayPal account to contribute.  Once you click on the payment button, you will see the option to enter your credit card information if you do not have a PayPal account.)


The Impact
I am passionate about family history and food!  This project brings both of these together in a poignant and delicious way.  Within one book people will be able to read stories of those people who have lived before us and shaped our lives.  The book will also contain recipes that have been handed down through the generations that we can incorporate into our own families and hand down to future generations. 
Our Ancestors' Recipes will be a keepsake that can be treasured now and in the future by our children and grandchildren.  My hope is that this book will also inspire families to share their own stories with their children, so that their stories are not lost to future generations.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute money, I truly understand.  Or if you prefer to wait for the release of the book to buy it, I understand that as well!
It would be a HUGE help if you could forward this to people that you know.  You can do this through Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or word of mouth!   You can use the Indiegogo share tools to make it easy!  The more people who know about Our Ancestors' Recipes the better this book will be! 
Thank you so much!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><em>“…reading the emotional storm through my silent expressions, he softly laughed and said, ""This is how I always want to remember you. Hungry. Open. Vulnerable. Consumed by desire. I want every moment of your life to be this electric. This…alive.'”--Candice Holdorf</em></p>
<h3>My story</h3>
<p>My name is Candice Holdorf. I am a writer and teacher of sexuality and orgasm. I spent many years of my life in desperate fear of my sexuality. I used anorexia as a way to numb my hunger. I hid behind my ex-husband so I wouldn't have to confront my desire. </p>
<p>Until the day came when I could not go on living as the walking dead. I made a ""fear list"" and did everything on that list because I wanted to know what was beyond my terror limit.</p>
<p>What I discovered was a woman learning to live in agreement with her own eroticism--which is not always easy given that we live in a society where female sexuality is reduced to an object to be won, bought, bartered or stolen. </p>
<p>Thanks to my own practice of connecting to orgasm, as well as teaching others to connect to their own, I now have access to a deeper truth: that as a woman, it is my birthright to know my pleasure, speak my desire and celebrate my sexuality.</p>
<p>This book is more than just a project. It’s my prayer for the planet.</p>
<h3>What is ""From 6 to 9""?</h3>
<p>""From 6 to 9 and Beyond: Widening the Lens of Feminine Eroticism"" uses 6 fictional short stories, 9 poems and artisitc photography by Seqouia Emmanuelle to capture the erotic awakening of 6 feminine archetypes: The Virgin, The Whore, The Warrior, The Queen, The Nun, The Grand-Mother.</p>
<p>My mission to shift the way we view sexuality, from sex as commerce to sex as expression of deepest truth.</p>
<p>My book moves beyond the male-gaze pornographic and Harlequin romance novel perspectives of female sexuality and reintroduces the <strong>erotic </strong>back into sex.</p>
<p>The me, the erotic is a way of living that is infused with joy, wonder and reverence for this life. Every moment is an opportunity to tap into that dynamic, pulsing life force we call <strong>orgasm</strong>.</p>

<h3>En Calle</h3>
<p>El proyecto documental animado sin fines de lucro ""En Calle"" busca generar conciencia sobre los problemas y situaciones que día con día enfrenta la gente en situación o riesgo de calle. Nuestro objetivo principal es lograr generar reflexión acerca de uno de los problemas más complejos de México mediante historias y vidas reales. Aunque todas las historias son contadas por niños o adultos en situación o riesgo de calle, en este proyecto nos apoyamos en la animación para eliminar prejuicios sociales y obtener la atención de la gente en el fondo del problema, escuchando de primera voz el testimonio.</p>
<p>Buscamos generar un cambio social desde lo más profundo de nuestras comunidades y esperamos que logremos generar esto empezando por ti.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Lo que ya se tiene y lo que necesitamos</h3>
<p>El proyecto de ""En Calle"" consta de las historias recolectadas a través de entrevistas realizadas a niños y adultos que viven en situación de calle en la ciudad de México. Todas las entrevistas han sido realizadas y editadas de manera cuidadosa para contar lo que a los entrevistados les parece más importante de su situación y su día a día. Una muestra de las primeras dos entrevistas y ediciones realizadas por nosotros son los primeros dos cortos que han sido publicados en <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5CD9CF592CA89252&amp;feature=mh_lolz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""En Calle youtube"">youtube</a> o <a href=""http://vimeo.com/31192239"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""En Calle Aldair vimeo"">vimeo</a>. En este momento se tienen otras 8 pistas de audio listas para ser convertidas a guión cinematográfico y animadas con más historias restantes de Aldair y Blanquita, así como algunos niños y jóvenes más. Incluso los <a href=""http://encalleserie.wordpress.com/2011/10/26/los-personajes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">personajes</a> ya han sido creados y se encuentran listos para ser animados en el momento que se obtengan los fondos.</p>
<p>Lo que hace falta en este momento para poder dar a conocer las historias de los demás entrevistados es el dinero para pagar a los animadores y/o postproductores por su tiempo, generar storyboards y obtener los equipos y software necesarios para crear y finalizar la animación 3D. Esencialmente, los fondos recaudados para esta causa se utilizarán para rentar el equipo y software requerido para terminar la serie y los otros ocho episodios restantes utilizando la misma técnica de animación 3D, así como para pagar el tiempo humano que se requiere. Nuestra finalidad es producirlo, no venderlo, así que todos los episodios terminados se distribuirán por internet bajo una licencia de Creative Commons, y quedan disponibles para que cualquiera pueda verlos y a su vez proyectarlos con nuestro permiso de manera gratuita, <a href=""http://encalleserie.wordpress.com/2012/03/20/proyeccion-en-el-taller-de-escultura-en-cendi-temoatzin/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">como ha ocurrido en ocasiones con los episodios ya producidos.</a></p>
<p>El dinero recaudado en esta campaña se utilizaría de la siguiente manera, de acuerdo a lo que se pueda obtener:</p>
<p>$1000 - equipo de cómputo</p>
<p>$2000 - equipo de cómputo, capítulos 3 y 4</p>
<p>$3000 - equipo de cómputo, capítulos 3, 4, 5, y 6</p>

<h3>Impacto </h3>
<p>Creemos que el impacto que puede tener esta serie a mediano y largo plazo no es sólo generar conciencia acerca de un problema que a todos nos incumbe pero también lograr poco a poco que la comunidad se involucre con su entorno. Que la comunidad entienda que todos somos parte de la misma sociedad, que mientras las mismas condiciones y tratos no sean ofrecidas a todas las personas, y que mientras no exijamos para todos lo que exigimos para nosotros mismos no podremos salir adelante como país y como sociedad. </p>
<p>Esperamos que esta serie muestre a mucha gente en México y en el mundo una realidad que se oculta todo el tiempo y por lo mismo no es atendida ni por los gobiernos ni por la misma sociedad. El primer punto de nuestro plan es generar esa opinión pública mediante la reflexión individual, que se traduzca en una conciencia del problema, y después generar programas utilizando otras instituciones para ayudar y apoyar iniciativas basándonos en la gente, instituciones o gobiernos que estén dispuestas a buscar una solución integral a esta situación que enfrenta un gran número de personas (niños y adultos).   </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Otras maneras en las que puedes ayudar</h3>
<p>Si no puedes o no estas interesado en donar para esta serie pero te interesa ayudar de otras maneras, existen muchas instituciones en México que llevan muchos años tratando de ayudar a la gente en situación de calle y la gran mayoría necesitan voluntarios. Las principales instituciones que fueron identificadas durante este proyecto son:</p>
<p>-        Fundación Juconi (Puebla)</p>
<p>-        Fundación Ednica (D.F. sur – Cerca del metro C.U.)</p>
<p>-        El Caracol AC (D.F. oriente - Zaragoza)</p>

<p>The CT National Youth Poetry Slam Team began in 1998 when CT hosted the first-ever National High School Poetry Slam.  Teams came from NYC, Worcester, Washington DC, New Mexico (the Navajo Nation) and of course, CT.  It was a 2 day event, held at the Charter Oak Cultural Center in Hartford.  The following year, the CT team went to Albuquerque (along with 7 other teams, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago) for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Annual National High School Slam.  This festival has grown into a yearly happening known as Brave New Voices, with up to 50 teams and 5 days. </p>
<p>Now called OneWord CT, we invite participation from around the state (rather than one major city, like most other teams).  Team members for 2013 include Sophie Dillon (New Haven), Coree DeShields (Norwich), Emily Falkowski (Manchester), Olive Kuhn (Middletown) and Evan Knoll (Middletown).</p>
<p><strong><em>""Through writing, we remind ourselves that we are all architects. Through performance, we remind ourselves that we are all ants, in awe of these things we have made."" ~ Sophie</em></strong></p>
<p>We host youth poetry slams throughout the year and offer spoken word workshops and orientations for schools and youth organizations, providing an outlet and a stage for young writers and performers.</p>
<em><strong>""Write as if your life depended on it!"" ~ Elizabeth<br/></strong></em>
<p>“OneWord CT changes lives.  It helps create a supportive community, as well as literary and stage opportunities that were not available when I was a struggling teenager, trying to find my voice,” says Ms Thomas.  Ms Thomas, along with high school English teachers Lee Keylock, Newtown HS and Laura Maiocco, Sheehan HS in Wallingford, CT and Devin Samuels, a student at UConn serve this year as volunteer coaches/chaperones/organizers for the Connecticut team.</p>
<p><em><strong>""Poetry is vital, because it allows one to tap that inner creativity he/she might never know they have."" ~ Coree</strong></em></p>
<p>Brave New Voices presents the youth of 21st century America in all their verve and diversity.  The festival focuses on arts education and performance, local program development, national movement organizing and the highlighting of a new generation of performing artists, audiences and literary opportunity. </p>
<p>A different city hosts BNV each August and this year will be in Chicago.  Teams come from around the world and 2013 will include Guam, Bermuda, England and South Africa, in addition to most major US cities.  One of the largest youth poetry festivals in the world, BNV brings together more than 600 youth and 100 nonprofit organizers to build a broad-based national movement of youth spoken word, civic engagement and youth development programs.</p>
<p><em><strong>""I love slam poetry.  It is freeing but intense, unstructured but challenging. At Brave New Voices, I hope to push my limits as a writer and performer and watch (and learn from) other young people do the same."" ~ Olive</strong></em></p>
<p>As adult volunteers, we wholeheartedly give of our time and energy throughout the year.  And now, we are asking for your help.  The money we raise will be used for the $1250 registration fee (covers our lodging, breakfast and entry into all events), our team transportation costs (airline tickets for 7) and hopefully a team celebratory meal while in Chicago.  Any money left over will be used for next year’s team.</p>

<p>Hello! As some of you may already know, my name is Alex Castille, and I’ve spent the last five years working in Early Childhood Education. In the last year or so, I started writing children’s and illustrating word books, releasing some of them on iBooks. People often ask if they can get physical copies of the books, but unfortunately I can’t afford the cost to get any of them put into production. But I’ve decided that I’m going to ask for help. Because I believe that this is something I'm good at and something that I can be successful with, so I’m ready to get out there and try to make it happen.</p>
<p>That’s where this campaign comes in. I am asking friends, family, or even strangers to help me fund this venture of my first run of physical books. It would be an awesome experience to finally have physical copies that I can donate to childcare centers and libraries around Portland, as well as have some available for people who would like to purchase a copy for their little one.</p>
<p>This book, Yuck Yucks and Yum Yums that I am trying to get printed is one that I think can be very beneficial to the toddlers who are in the midst of exploring the world through their mouths.

</div></div>","Hello! As some of you may already know, my name is Alex Castille, and I’ve spent the last five years working in Early Childhood Education. In the last year or so, I started writing children’s and illustrating word books, releasing some of them on iBooks. People often ask if they can get physical copies of the books, but unfortunately I can’t afford the cost to get any of them put into production. But I’ve decided that I’m going to ask for help. Because I believe that this is something I'm good at and something that I can be successful with, so I’m ready to get out there and try to make it happen.
That’s where this campaign comes in. I am asking friends, family, or even strangers to help me fund this venture of my first run of physical books. It would be an awesome experience to finally have physical copies that I can donate to childcare centers and libraries around Portland, as well as have some available for people who would like to purchase a copy for their little one.
This book, Yuck Yucks and Yum Yums that I am trying to get printed is one that I think can be very beneficial to the toddlers who are in the midst of exploring the world through their mouths. I also feel that this book will be especially beneficial for teachers and little ones in childcare centers where they regularly use art materials that some kiddos find irresistible and must taste. I believe that Yuck Yucks and Yum Yums will be a useful tool for parents, teachers, or any caregiver with little ones.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Mile Behind The Smile: This book revolves around the stories of people who have been able to find happiness through acts of selflessness, service, and ultimately, love, as well as the struggles they had to overcome to live life peacefully. We learn that this ability to become vulnerable and not hide parts of your life that have weighed you down is what leads us to live happily.<br/><br/>My name is Calvin Long and I am the author of Mile Behind The Smile. I wrote this book because I’ve learned how important it is to learn from the stories of others, but also our own. Every person you encounter is writing their own life story with a lesson to offer to you.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover where your happiness stems from in your life. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for learning from others in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you live life to the fullest, leaving what’s heavy behind and flourishing.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn from stories of individuals who have grown to live a happy, selfless life and overcame the obstacles that once stood in their way, learning lessons such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Letting go of a heavy past, not allowing past struggles or insecurities define who you are now</li>
<li>Taking risks for personal growth, having the strength to make decisions that lead to a happier life</li>
<li>How anyone can make an impact, every single one of us can change the world for at least one person through our words and actions</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in learning from the stories of others, truly listening to their words and taking them to heart. If you may have suffered from self-doubt, insecurities, or even finding happiness in their lives, the stories in these chapters will offer you guidance and support to help discover the love around you.<br/><br/><i>Mile Behind the Smile</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to people looking to better their lives and embrace their own stories who are looking at the power behind their voice for the first time.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book - Mile Behind the Smile</h3>
<p>The book is written as a collection of stories, with each chapter telling the story of an individual with their own personal story, their unique struggles, and a heartfelt lesson to offer to the reader.<br/><br/>The stories begin with themes relating to finding happiness internally, such as finding peace within ourselves. As each chapter leads to the next, it slowly transitions into discovering the happiness and love that exist within the things, and people around you. No two stories are the same, offering their own individual wisdom on life, happiness, and stories.</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Calvin Long is an alum from John Carroll University, where he studied Marketing, Supply Chain Management, and Entrepreneurship. During those four years, he worked as a student librarian where he fell in love with books and how every single book offered it’s own unique perspective, just like human beings.<br/><br/>Through participating in religious retreats, immersion trips to Latin America and engaging in volunteer work around the Cleveland area, he learned the importance of helping other people and truly listening to their stories. However, this passion for helping others has been in his heart since childhood. From elementary school until his first year of college, he would spend the summer volunteering at a food and clothing drive in the basement of his church, connecting to those he encountered. While in high school, he earned the rank of Eagle Scout, instilling the importance of service in his life.<br/><br/>No matter where his life may lead him or the path that he takes, he will always have the same mission: Make an impact. He might not be able to change the entire world, but that doesn’t stop him from aspiring to change the world for one person, even in the smallest acts of kindness, such as listening or holding a door for a stranger.<br/><br/>He invites you to join his journey in learning from the stories of others, discovering the mile each speaker had to endure to achieve their smile and happiness. With each smile comes a heartbreak, each story comes a villain, so often played by ourselves. Through sharing our own personal story, full of struggles and triumphs, he hopes to inspire you to live life as your own authentic self, living happily and peacefully.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Calvin at CLong0103@gmail.com or  CalvnLong3 on Instagram.</p>

Nel tempo, il nostro duro lavoro ci ha portati ad essere invitati nelle più importanti fiere d'Italia, tra cui il Lucca Comics & Games 2015, dove abbiamo omaggiato il ventennale di Evangelion, riempiendo una sala con più di 500 persone. Nel 2016 realizziamo a Bologna un evento interamente dedicato ad Evangelion, al fianco della Associazione NipPop, con proiezioni, conferenze e mostre.  
Questa campagna porterà alla creazione della Associazione Culturale Evangelion Italian Fan, la prima associazione italiana di Evangelion. 
Perchè importante? Fondare una associazione ci permetterà di avvicinarci a tutti i fan di Evangelion in Italia, tramite eventi e appuntamenti.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
